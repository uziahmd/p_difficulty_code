Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Leha who wants to split his vacation into two parts using two vouchers. The goal is to find the minimal total cost of such two vouchers that don't overlap and their durations add up exactly to x.\n\nHmm, let's break down the problem.\n\nSo, each voucher has a start day li, end day ri, and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. We need to choose two different vouchers i and j such that:\n\n1. Their durations sum to exactly x.\n2. They don't intersect. That means either the end of one is before the start of the other, or vice versa.\n3. The total cost is as small as possible.\n\nIf no such pair exists, we output -1.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to efficiently find all possible pairs of vouchers that meet these conditions.\n\nThe constraints are n up to 2e5, which is pretty big. So any O(n^2) approach is probably going to be too slow. We need a more efficient way.\n\nWait, but for each voucher, perhaps we can precompute what kind of vouchers would complement it to reach a total duration x. Because for each voucher i with duration d_i, we need a voucher j with duration d_j = x - d_i.\n\nSo, for each voucher i, we can look for vouchers j where d_j is x - d_i. Then, check if i and j can be non-overlapping.\n\nBut even then, considering all possible i and looking for j in O(1) or O(log n) time is tricky.\n\nLet me think about the data structures. Maybe for each possible duration d, we can keep a list of all vouchers with that duration, sorted by their end times. Then, for each voucher i of duration d_i, we can look for vouchers j of duration d_j = x - d_i, and check if they don't overlap.\n\nBut how do we quickly find if there's a j that doesn't overlap with i?\n\nWait, maybe we can represent vouchers in a way that allows us to query for non-overlapping ones.\n\nFor example, for each duration d, we can sort the vouchers in a way that allows us to find vouchers ending before a certain time, or starting after a certain time.\n\nAlternatively, for each voucher, when considering possible j vouchers, we can determine the earliest end time of a j voucher that ends before i's start, or the earliest start time of a j voucher that starts after i's end.\n\nBut perhaps the most straightforward approach is:\n\n- For each voucher i, compute d_i = ri - li + 1.\n- Then, the required d_j is x - d_i.\n- If d_j is not positive, skip (since durations are at least 1).\n- Now, among all vouchers j with duration d_j, find those that either end before li, or start after ri.\n\nWe can pre-process the vouchers by duration and keep them sorted in a way that allows quick queries.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers into a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of tuples containing (li, ri, costi) for each voucher of that duration.\n\n2. For each duration d, sort the vouchers in the list based on their end times (ri). This will help us find vouchers that end before a certain time quickly.\n\n3. For each voucher i, calculate d_i. Then, the required d_j is x - d_i. If d_j is not present in the dictionary, continue.\n\n4. For each j in the list of d_j:\n   a. Check if j's end time is <= i's start time - 1 (so they don't overlap).\n   b. Or if j's start time is >= i's end time + 1.\n   c. Also, make sure that j is not the same voucher as i.\n\n5. Among all valid j, find the one with the smallest cost. Add i's cost to it and track the minimum.\n\n6. After checking all possible i and j, return the minimal total cost found. If none found, return -1.\n\nBut wait, this might still be O(n^2), because for each i, we could potentially scan through all j of the required d_j. However, since each d_j could have multiple vouchers, and the lists are sorted, we can perform binary search to find the earliest possible j that meets the non-overlapping condition.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- For each voucher i:\n   - Calculate d_i.\n   - Compute target_d = x - d_i. If target_d <=0, skip.\n   - If target_d not in the dictionary, continue.\n   - Get the list of vouchers with duration target_d, sorted by ri.\n   - Find all j in this list where j's end <= i's start -1 OR j's start >= i's end +1.\n   - For each such j, if j is not i, compute the sum of costs and track the minimum.\n\nBut even with this, for each i, how do we efficiently find the best j? Because for each i, it's possible that there are many j's, and checking each one is O(m) per i, which could be expensive if m is large.\n\nAn alternative approach: for each j, precompute the minimal cost for a given end time or start time.\n\nWait, perhaps for each duration d, we can create two sorted lists:\n\n- One sorted by ri, so for a given i, we can binary search to find all j's with ri <= li-1.\n\n- Another sorted by li, so for a given i, we can find j's with li >= ri+1.\n\nThen, for each i, for its target_d, we can perform two binary searches on the corresponding lists to find the minimal cost.\n\nYes, that seems promising.\n\nSo the detailed plan is:\n\n1. For each voucher, compute its duration. Group vouchers into a dictionary where the key is the duration, and for each group, maintain two sorted lists:\n   a. Sorted by ri: for quick lookup of j's that end before a certain time.\n   b. Sorted by li: for quick lookup of j's that start after a certain time.\n\n2. For each voucher i:\n   a. Compute d_i = ri - li + 1.\n   b. Compute target_d = x - d_i. If target_d <=0, skip.\n   c. If target_d is not in the dictionary, skip.\n   d. Else, from the target_d group, get the list of vouchers sorted by ri and the list sorted by li.\n   e. For the sorted_by_ri list, find all j's where ri <= li_i -1. The minimal cost in this subset (excluding j=i) is a candidate.\n   f. For the sorted_by_li list, find all j's where li_j >= ri_i +1. The minimal cost in this subset is another candidate.\n   g. Take the minimal of these candidates (if any) and add to i's cost. Update the global minimum.\n\nThis way, each i can be processed in O(log m) time, where m is the number of vouchers with target_d.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, the preprocessing:\n\n- Create a dictionary, say duration_map, where each key is a duration, and the value is a tuple of two lists: one sorted by ri, another sorted by li, along with their costs.\n\nFor each voucher, we'll process them into this structure.\n\nOnce this is done, for each i, we can quickly access the necessary lists for target_d.\n\nNow, the steps for each i:\n\n1. Compute d_i and target_d.\n\n2. For target_d, if not present, skip.\n\n3. For the target_d group, get the two sorted lists: sorted_ri and sorted_li.\n\n4. For sorted_ri, find all j's where j's ri <= i's li -1.\n\n   To do this, perform a binary search on the sorted_ri list for the maximum ri that is <= i_li -1. Then, in the sublist up to that index, find the minimal cost, but ensuring that j is not i.\n\n   Wait, but how to handle if j is i. Because in the sorted_ri list, i may or may not be present.\n\n   Hmm, perhaps during the binary search, we can include all j's up to that point, and then find the minimal cost, but subtract the case where j is i.\n\n   Alternatively, when processing i, we can note that for j in the same duration group, j can't be the same as i.\n\n   But this complicates things. Alternatively, when we collect all j's that meet the condition, we can ensure that j is not i.\n\n   But that's not feasible because for each i, the j's are in a list, and the same i may appear multiple times in different groups.\n\nWait, but in the sorted_ri list, each j is a voucher, including possibly i itself. So when we find j's in the list, we need to exclude the case where j == i.\n\nBut how? Because for each i, we have to process j's in the target_d group, and some of them may be i.\n\nWait, but for a voucher j to be in the target_d group, j's duration must be target_d, which is x - d_i.\n\nBut since i's duration is d_i, j's duration is x -d_i. So for j to be i, x must be equal to 2*d_i, and j's duration is d_i.\n\nWhich is only possible if x is even and d_i is x/2.\n\nBut in that case, i would have to be in the target_d group (as its duration is d_i = x/2, which is target_d). So when processing i, we need to consider whether there exists j's in the target_d group that are not i, and satisfy the non-overlapping condition.\n\nSo during the processing of i, when looking for j's in the target_d group, we can have two cases:\n\na. j's end <= i_li -1.\n\nb. j's start >= i_ri +1.\n\nIn both cases, j must not be i.\n\nThus, for each i, when querying the sorted_ri list, we can find all j's with ri <= i_li -1, and among them, find the minimal cost, excluding j=i.\n\nSimilarly for the sorted_li list.\n\nBut how?\n\nWell, perhaps for each target_d group, in the sorted_ri list, each j is represented as (ri, cost, li), but sorted by ri.\n\nBut when we're searching for j's with ri <= some value, we can find the maximal ri that satisfies this, and then within that subset, find the minimal cost, making sure that j is not i.\n\nWait, but how do we know if i is in that subset?\n\nBecause i is part of the target_d group, but when we process i, we can extract its own (ri, cost, li) and see if it's in the subset.\n\nBut that could be computationally expensive. Alternatively, perhaps when building the sorted_ri list, each j is stored as a tuple, and during the binary search, the entire list is considered, but when computing the minimal cost, we can check if any of the minimal cost vouchers is i, and if so, take the next minimal.\n\nBut that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each i, when we look for j's in the target_d group, we can first find the minimal cost j that satisfies the condition, regardless of whether j is i, and then check if j is i, and if so, find the next minimal.\n\nBut that would require additional bookkeeping.\n\nHmm, this seems tricky. Perhaps an alternative approach is to preprocess for each duration d, the minimal cost for any j that ends before a certain time, and for any j that starts after a certain time.\n\nWait, but the problem is that for a given i, the time is specific, and for each target_d, the minimal cost j that meets the condition could vary.\n\nAnother idea: For each duration d, in the sorted_ri list, store the minimal cost up to each position. Similarly, for the sorted_li list, store the minimal cost from each position onwards.\n\nWait, perhaps for each d, for the sorted_ri list, we can precompute a prefix minimum array. So for any index k in the list, the minimal cost in the first k+1 elements is known.\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted_li list, precompute a suffix minimum array, so for any index k, the minimal cost from k to the end is known.\n\nThat way, when we find the maximal index in the sorted_ri list where ri <= i_li -1, we can query the prefix min up to that index, and get the minimal cost in that subset.\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted_li list, find the first index where li >= i_ri +1, and query the suffix min from that index onwards.\n\nThis approach could work. So let's think about implementing this.\n\nSo during the preprocessing:\n\nFor each duration d:\n\n- sorted_ri is a list sorted by ri, each element is a tuple (ri, li, cost).\n\n- Compute a prefix_min array, where prefix_min[k] is the minimal cost in the first k+1 elements (from 0 to k) of sorted_ri.\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted_li list:\n\n- sorted_li is a list sorted by li, each element is a tuple (li, ri, cost).\n\n- Compute a suffix_min array, where suffix_min[k] is the minimal cost from index k to the end.\n\nThen, for each i:\n\nCompute d_i and target_d.\n\nFor the target_d group:\n\n- sorted_ri_list = sorted_ri of target_d.\n\n- Use binary search to find the largest index where ri <= i_li -1.\n\n   If such an index exists, then the minimal cost in this subset is prefix_min[index].\n\n   But then, check if any of the vouchers in this subset is i itself.\n\n   If yes, we need to find the next minimal cost.\n\nBut wait, how? Because the prefix_min gives the minimal cost, but if that minimal cost is i's cost, then we need to take the next minimal.\n\nThis adds complexity. Alternatively, perhaps during the preprocessing, for each d, for the sorted_ri list, we can also track the minimal cost without including i, but that's not feasible because i is part of the list and varies per i.\n\nHmm, maybe an alternative is to, for each i, when we compute the minimal cost from the prefix_min, we can check if the current minimal cost is from i, and if so, find the next minimal.\n\nBut how to do that quickly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can just allow j to be the same as i, but then subtract the case where j is i.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, i and j must be different vouchers. So even if j is i, it's invalid.\n\nSo during the processing of i, when we find that the minimal cost in the prefix_min is i's cost, we need to find the next minimal in that subset.\n\nBut this requires knowing which elements are in the subset, which is not directly accessible via the prefix_min array.\n\nSo this seems challenging. Maybe an alternative approach is to, for each i, when looking for j's in the target_d group, first find all j's that meet the condition and are not i, and then find the minimal cost among them.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps for each i, in the target_d group, when we perform the binary search to find j's that end before i's li, we can iterate through the j's in that subset and find the minimal cost j != i.\n\nBut this would be O(k) for k j's in the subset, which could be expensive if k is large.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the preprocessing step, for each d, we can create a list of sorted_ri and sorted_li, along with a separate list of costs, and for each, precompute the prefix and suffix minima, but also track the indices where the minimal cost occurs.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nMaybe another angle: For each i, when looking for j's in the target_d group, the j's that satisfy the condition are either:\n\n1. All j's in the target_d group with ri <= i_li -1.\n\nOR\n\n2. All j's in the target_d group with li >= i_ri +1.\n\nFor each of these two groups, find the minimal cost j that is not i.\n\nSo for each i, and each of the two groups, we can:\n\n- Find the minimal cost in that group.\n\n- If the minimal cost is from i, then we need to find the next minimal in that group.\n\nElse, that's our candidate.\n\nBut again, how to quickly find the next minimal if the minimal is i.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can precompute for each group the minimal cost and the second minimal cost, along with the indices where they occur.\n\nBut that might not be feasible since the groups can be large, and updating this information for each addition is time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each group, we can maintain a heap that allows us to get the minimal cost quickly, and when i is in the group, we can remove it and then get the new minimal.\n\nBut this would require that for each i, when processing, we can check if i is in the target_d group and in the subset.\n\nWait, perhaps for each group, during the preprocessing, we can create a sorted list of vouchers and for each voucher, have a way to quickly find whether it's in a certain subset.\n\nBut this might be difficult.\n\nAn alternative idea: Since each voucher is in exactly one group (based on its duration), perhaps for each i, when processing the target_d group, we can first find all j's that meet the condition (non-overlapping), and then among them, pick the one with minimal cost, ignoring i.\n\nSo perhaps, for each i, in the target_d group, after finding the subset via binary search, we can iterate through all j's in that subset and find the minimal cost j != i.\n\nBut this could be O(m) for each i, which is not acceptable for n=2e5.\n\nWait, but what is the maximum possible size of the target_d group? It depends on the input, but for n=2e5, each group could be up to 2e5, making the overall approach O(n log n) for each i, leading to O(n^2 log n), which is definitely too slow.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the initial approach might not be feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires a smarter approach.\n\nWait, the minimal cost is required. So for each i, we can find the minimal cost j in the target_d group that is compatible with i.\n\nSo perhaps, for each target_d group, we can precompute the minimal cost voucher that ends before a certain time, and the minimal cost voucher that starts after a certain time.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, for the sorted_ri list, each voucher is ordered by ri. So for any time t, all vouchers in the list with ri <= t can be found via binary search.\n\nAmong these, the minimal cost is needed.\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted_li list, for any time t, all vouchers with li >= t can be found, and the minimal cost is needed.\n\nSo the idea is to precompute for each d, the minimal cost in the sorted_ri list up to each possible ri, and the minimal cost in the sorted_li list from each possible li.\n\nBut how to precompute this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each d:\n\n- In the sorted_ri list, create an array min_cost_up_to that for each index i, stores the minimal cost from 0 to i.\n\n- Similarly, for the sorted_li list, create an array min_cost_from that for each index i, stores the minimal cost from i to the end.\n\nThis way, for any query, we can perform a binary search to find the relevant range and then use the precomputed arrays to get the minimal cost.\n\nBut again, the issue is that when i is in the subset, the minimal cost might be i's cost, so we need to avoid choosing i.\n\nSo perhaps, the steps are:\n\nFor each i:\n\n1. Compute d_i and target_d.\n\n2. For target_d, get the sorted_ri list and the min_cost_up_to array.\n\n3. Find the largest index k where ri <= i_li -1.\n\n   If k is -1 (no such j exists), move to the next case.\n\n4. The minimal cost in this range is min_cost_up_to[k]. But check if this cost is from i. How?\n\nAh, this is the crux. Because the min_cost_up_to array includes i's cost if i is in the subset.\n\nSo for example, if i is the voucher with the minimal cost in the subset, then the min_cost_up_to[k] would be i's cost, but we cannot choose j = i.\n\nSo in this case, we need to find the next minimal cost in the subset.\n\nBut how to do that quickly.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWhen building the min_cost_up_to array, for each index, we can store the minimal cost and the count of how many times this minimal cost appears in the range up to that index.\n\nBut this might not be enough, as we'd need to know if any of the minimal cost vouchers is i.\n\nWait, but for each i, in the target_d group, when we process the sorted_ri list, we can check if i is in the subset (ri <= i_li -1). If it is, then the min_cost_up_to[k] might be i's cost, so we have to look for the next minimal.\n\nBut to do that, perhaps we can precompute for each d, the minimal cost and the second minimal cost in the sorted_ri list, along with the earliest occurrence.\n\nBut this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each i, when processing the target_d group, we can find all j's that meet the condition, and then select the minimal cost j that is not i.\n\nBut this would require O(m) time for each i, which is not acceptable.\n\nWait, perhaps we can optimize this by noting that for each i, in the target_d group, the j's that are non-overlapping and not i can be found quickly.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nPerhaps I should think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\nVouchers:\n\n1 3 4 → duration 3 days.\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2.\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2.\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2.\n\nSo x is 5.\n\nFor each voucher i, we look for target_d =5 - d_i.\n\nSo for the first voucher (d_i=3), target_d=2.\n\nIn the group for d=2, the vouchers are:\n\n(1,2,5), (5,6,1), (1,2,4).\n\nWait, no, the third voucher is 5 6 1 → ri is 6, li is 5, cost 1.\n\nWait, in the group d=2, the sorted_ri list would be:\n\nsorted by ri:\n\n(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1).\n\nSo their ri values are 2, 2, 6.\n\nFor i being the first voucher (li=1, ri=3, cost=4), target_d=2.\n\nWe look in the sorted_ri list for j's with ri <= 0 (since i_li -1 is 0). None exist. So move to the next case.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, i_li is 1, so i_li -1 is 0. So j's ri must be <=0. But the sorted_ri list for d=2 has j's with ri 2, 2,6. So no j's in this case.\n\nThen, we look for j's in the sorted_li list of d=2.\n\nSorted_li list is sorted by li: 1,1,5.\n\nSo for i's ri is 3, i_ri +1 is 4.\n\nWe look for j's with li >=4.\n\nIn the sorted_li list, the li's are 1,1,5. So 5 >=4. So the j's are the last one, which is (5,6,1).\n\nSo the minimal cost in this subset is 1. So the total cost is 4+1=5.\n\nWhich is the correct answer.\n\nSo for this i, we find the j in the sorted_li group.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nBut how to handle the case when the minimal j is i itself.\n\nFor example, suppose i is the minimal cost in the sorted_ri group.\n\nIn that case, the min_cost_up_to[k] would be i's cost. But since j must be different from i, we need to find the next minimal.\n\nBut how can we do that quickly.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea: For each d, in the sorted_ri list, besides the prefix_min array, also store the count of the minimal cost. So for each index, we can know whether the minimal cost is unique or not.\n\nSimilarly, for each d, in the sorted_li list, store the suffix_min array.\n\nSo when processing i:\n\nFor the sorted_ri group, find the max index k where ri <= i_li -1.\n\nIf k >=0:\n\n   min_cost = prefix_min[k]\n\n   count = how many times this cost appears in the first k+1 elements.\n\n   if count >1: then j can be any of the min_cost vouchers except i.\n\n   else: if the minimal cost voucher is i, then we need to find the next minimal cost.\n\nBut how to find the next minimal.\n\nWait, but perhaps the minimal cost is not i. So the min_cost could be from another voucher, or it could be i.\n\nSo when min_cost is found, we need to check if any of the vouchers contributing to this min_cost is i.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each i, when looking for j's in the target_d group, the j must be in the subset and not equal to i.\n\nSo, perhaps, the minimal cost in the subset is the minimal of all j's in the subset, excluding i.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute for each d, the minimal cost in each possible range, and for each i, when checking, if i is in that range, subtract i's cost and find the next minimal.\n\nBut again, it's unclear.\n\nAt this point, perhaps it's better to proceed with the initial approach, and see if it can be implemented with optimizations.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Preprocess the vouchers into a dictionary, where each key is a duration, and for each duration, we have two sorted lists: sorted_ri and sorted_li, along with the prefix_min and suffix_min arrays.\n\n2. For each i, compute d_i and target_d.\n\n3. For target_d, get the sorted_ri and sorted_li lists.\n\n4. For sorted_ri, find the largest index where ri <= i_li -1. If any such j exists, the minimal cost in this subset is prefix_min[index], but if j is i, find the next minimal.\n\n5. Similarly, for sorted_li, find the smallest index where li >= i_ri +1. If any such j exists, the minimal cost is suffix_min[index], but again check if j is i.\n\nBut the problem is step 4 and 5: how to find the minimal cost j that is not i.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative Idea: When building the prefix_min array for sorted_ri, for each index, we can track the list of vouchers that contribute to the minimal cost up to that index.\n\nThen, when checking if i is in that list, we can quickly determine if the minimal cost is from i.\n\nBut storing the list for each index is not feasible due to memory constraints.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each i, when processing the target_d group, and when we have a subset (like j's ri <= i_li -1), we can first find the minimal cost in that subset. Then, if the minimal cost is from i, we need to find the next minimal cost in that subset.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps for each d, in the sorted_ri list, we can also precompute a structure that allows us to quickly find the next minimal cost after a certain voucher.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can accept that for some cases, the algorithm may have to scan through a subset to find the minimal cost j that is not i, but in practice, such cases are rare.\n\nWait, but given that n is up to 2e5, this is not acceptable.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps another approach: for each j in the target_d group, when checking against i, we can quickly determine if j is i.\n\nBut again, for each i, the target_d group could be large.\n\nWait, perhaps for each i, in the target_d group, we can find j's that are compatible and not i.\n\nBut the question is how to do this efficiently.\n\nAnother Idea: For each voucher i, during the preprocessing, for each target_d, we can find j's that are compatible and not i.\n\nBut this seems difficult.\n\nAt this point, perhaps it's better to proceed with the initial approach, but during the processing of i and j, check if j is i, and if so, skip it.\n\nBut how to do this.\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nWe'll have a dictionary duration_map, where for each d, we have:\n\n- sorted_ri: list of tuples (ri, li, cost), sorted by ri.\n\n- prefix_min: array where prefix_min[k] is the minimal cost from 0 to k.\n\n- sorted_li: list of tuples (li, ri, cost), sorted by li.\n\n- suffix_min: array where suffix_min[k] is the minimal cost from k to end.\n\nAdditionally, for each d, we can have a set of all vouchers in that group for quick lookups.\n\nWait, but for each d, the group is a collection of vouchers with that duration. So for each voucher i, when we process it, we can check if i is in the target_d group.\n\nBut for each i, the target_d group is known, and in that group, we can have a set of all vouchers (li, ri, cost), so we can check if i is present.\n\nBut storing all vouchers as tuples in a set for each group is manageable.\n\nSo during preprocessing:\n\nFor each voucher, compute d = ri - li + 1.\n\nAdd the voucher to duration_map[d]'s set, and append to the sorted_ri and sorted_li lists.\n\nAlso, compute the prefix_min and suffix_min arrays.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nvouchers = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    l, r, c = map(int, input().split())\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, c) )\n\nduration_map = defaultdict(lambda: {'set': set(), 'sorted_ri': [], 'sorted_li': [], 'prefix_min': [], 'suffix_min': []})\n\nfor l, r, c in vouchers:\n    d = r - l + 1\n    duration_map[d]['set'].add( (l, r, c) )\n    # add to sorted_ri\n    sorted_ri = sorted( duration_map[d]['sorted_ri'], key=lambda x: x[1] )\n    duration_map[d]['sorted_ri'] = sorted_ri.copy()\n    # compute prefix_min\n    prefix_min = []\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n    for item in sorted_ri:\n        if item[2] < min_so_far:\n            min_so_far = item[2]\n        prefix_min.append(min_so_far)\n    duration_map[d]['prefix_min'] = prefix_min\n\n    # add to sorted_li\n    sorted_li = sorted( duration_map[d]['sorted_li'], key=lambda x: x[0] )\n    duration_map[d]['sorted_li'] = sorted_li.copy()\n    # compute suffix_min\n    suffix_min = [float('inf')] * len(sorted_li)\n    if len(sorted_li) > 0:\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for i in reversed(range(len(sorted_li))):\n            min_so_far = min( min_so_far, sorted_li[i][2] )\n            suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n    duration_map[d]['suffix_min'] = suffix_min\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher i, process as follows:\n\nmin_total = infinity\n\nfor i in vouchers:\n    l_i, r_i, c_i = i\n    d_i = r_i -

So, the j can be any other voucher.\n\nSo, for each voucher i and j, i and j must be different.\n\nSo, back to the code.\n\nSo, for the second case, j can be any other voucher.\n\nIn the code, when processing each voucher, we're trying all possible j's, but in the code, j is any voucher, but when i and j are same voucher, but i and j are same.\n\nSo in the code, we have to ensure that i and j are different.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the vouchers are different, but the same voucher can be used as two vouchers, but the problem requires that i and j are different.\n\nSo, in the code, for each pair (i,j), it's allowed as long as they don't overlap and sum to x.\n\nSo, the problem is that, for each pair, the sum is x, and they are non-overlapping.\n\nSo, during the processing",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers whose combined duration equals exactly `x` days and whose total cost is minimized.
