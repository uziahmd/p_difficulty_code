The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about selecting which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for each remaining district is maximized. The input gives a tree structure because there's exactly one path between any two districts. So the task is to find a subtree (connected) that includes as many high-value nodes as possible after removing k nodes.\n\nHmm. Wait, the president wants to remove k contestants, which means we need to keep n-k districts. But the key is to choose which k to remove such that the remaining are all connected and their total is maximum.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a connected subtree with exactly (n - k) nodes, maximizing the sum of 2^d for each node d in the subtree.\n\nBut wait, no. Because when you remove a node, you also cut all edges connected to it, right? So the remaining districts must form a connected component without any of the removed ones.\n\nWait, but if the original tree is connected, then after removing some nodes, the remaining nodes will form a forest. We need to choose the forest's trees such that each is a connected component, but the problem says that the remaining districts should be able to reach each other. So the remaining districts must form a single connected component. So, we need to select a subtree of size (n - k) such that it's connected.\n\nSo the problem is similar to finding a subtree of size m = n -k that is connected, and the sum of 2^d for the nodes in the subtree is as large as possible.\n\nOur goal is to maximize the sum, so we want as many high-numbered districts as possible, since 2^d grows exponentially with d. So, higher d contributes more to the sum.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to include the highest possible d's in the subtree. So, perhaps the best way is to find a subtree that includes all the largest possible nodes, ensuring that they are connected.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure connectivity? Because the tree could have various structures.\n\nI think the approach here is to model the problem as selecting a subtree where the sum of 2^d is as large as possible. To maximize this, we want as many high d as possible, but connected.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tree. Since it's a tree, the subtree we choose must form a connected component.\n\nAn alternative approach: For each node, decide whether to keep it or not, ensuring that the kept nodes form a connected component, and that the total number of kept nodes is (n -k).\n\nBut trying all possibilities is computationally impossible, especially since n can be up to 1e6.\n\nWe need an efficient way to find the optimal set of nodes.\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible sum. It would be achieved by including all the highest-numbered nodes possible in a connected subtree. So perhaps the optimal subtree is formed by a chain of the highest possible nodes, connected together.\n\nWait, another thought: the subtree must be connected. So, the minimal subtree that includes all the nodes from some s to t in the tree, where s is the lowest node in the subtree and t is the highest.\n\nWait, but the tree isn't necessarily a straight line. So maybe the subtree is a star-shaped structure, but that might not be as good as a linear chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is a path that includes the highest possible nodes.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAnother idea: For each node, determine its depth in the tree. Then, nodes higher in the tree (higher numbering) have higher 2^d values. So, perhaps, the optimal subtree includes all the nodes that are in some path that starts at some node and includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nWait, maybe the solution is to find a subtree where the nodes form a path. Because in a tree, the largest connected subtree is a path if the tree is a straight line, but in a general tree, it's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is a subtree that includes the top (n -k) nodes, arranged in a connected way.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, let's think about the problem differently. Suppose we decide which nodes to keep. The sum is sum(2^d for d in kept_nodes). We want to maximize this sum.\n\nSince 2^d increases exponentially, it's better to include higher d nodes. So the optimal strategy is to include as many high d nodes as possible, as long as they form a connected subtree.\n\nSo the plan is to find a connected subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible, with the size being (n -k).\n\nSo how do we find such a subtree?\n\nPerhaps, the optimal subtree is the one that contains the largest possible subset of high-numbered nodes, forming a connected component.\n\nAn alternative approach is to find the largest possible connected component that can be formed by keeping the top (n -k) nodes, but ensuring that they are connected.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily correct because the top (n -k) nodes may not be connected. So we need to find a connected subtree that includes as many as possible of the top (n -k) nodes.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the process is:\n\n1. Find all possible candidate subtrees that consist of a certain set of nodes, preferably the largest possible, and check if they are connected.\n\nBut given the constraints on n (up to 1e6), this is not feasible.\n\nSo, perhaps a better approach is needed.\n\nWait, here's an alternative idea inspired by the fact that 2^d is exponential: the node with the highest d is worth more than all lower nodes combined. So, including higher d is better.\n\nThus, the optimal subtree will consist of a chain starting from some node and going up to the highest node, including as many high d nodes as possible within a connected component.\n\nSo perhaps, the optimal subtree is a path that includes the highest possible nodes.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAnother approach: the subtree must form a connected component. So, perhaps the subtree is a subtree that is a path in the original tree.\n\nIn a tree, any two nodes have exactly one path connecting them. So, if we select a path that includes as many high d nodes as possible, that could be a candidate.\n\nWait, but the path may not include enough nodes to reach the required size (n -k). So perhaps we need to find a path that includes as many high d nodes as possible, and then include some additional nodes attached to this path.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is formed by choosing the subtree that includes all nodes except those in a certain path. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached using dynamic programming on the tree. For each node, compute the maximum sum when considering a subtree that includes that node and extends up towards the root.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that has the highest sum of 2^d, and is connected. Since 2^d is an exponential function, the higher the d, the better. So the optimal subtree is the one that includes the highest possible nodes.\n\nSo perhaps, the subtree is the one that includes all the nodes that are in the top (n -k) nodes, but connected.\n\nWait, but how to connect them? Because in a tree, they might not be directly connected.\n\nWait, perhaps the subtree is a chain that starts at the highest node and goes down as far as possible, but including as many high nodes as possible.\n\nAnother angle: Let's imagine that the optimal subtree is a subtree that consists of a path from some node u to the root, but that's not necessarily true.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of selecting the subtree that forms a star around the highest node. That way, all the highest possible nodes are connected through the highest node.\n\nBut wait, the highest node (say, n) is connected to some other nodes. If we include as many of those as possible, then the subtree will be connected.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal subtree is the subtree that includes the node n and as many of its adjacent nodes as possible, ensuring that the total size is (n -k). Then, recursively do the same for the adjacent nodes, but that seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that includes all the highest (n -k) nodes in a connected way.\n\nBut again, how to find that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into selecting which nodes to exclude. We need to remove k nodes such that the remaining nodes form a connected component. And among all possible options, we want the one with the maximum sum.\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to selecting a connected induced subgraph of size (n -k) with the maximum sum of 2^d.\n\nSince 2^d is increasing with d, the maximum sum will be achieved by including the highest d nodes possible, provided they are connected.\n\nSo, the approach is to find a connected subtree that includes as many high d nodes as possible.\n\nNow, the question is: how to find such a subtree.\n\nAn alternative idea is to find the subtree that is a star centered at some node, but that's probably not optimal unless the node has a lot of children.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is a path that includes the highest possible d's.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the subtree consisting of all the nodes along the path from some node to the root, but that depends on the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled by finding the centroid of the tree and building the subtree around that.\n\nHmm, but I'm not making progress here.\n\nLet me think about the example given.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nn=6, k=3.\n\nThe tree is:\n\nEdges are 2-1, 2-6, 4-2,5-6,2-3.\n\nSo the structure is:\n\n1 connected to 2.\n\n2 connected to 3,4,5,6.\n\n6 connected to 5.\n\nSo the tree looks like this:\n\n      2\n    / | \\\n   1 3 4\n        |\n        5\n        |\n        6\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me draw it:\n\nActually, the edges are:\n\n2-1, 2-6, 4-2, 5-6, 2-3.\n\nSo node 2 is connected to 1, 3,4,6.\n\nNode 6 is connected to 2 and 5.\n\nSo the structure is:\n\n- Node 2 is the central node, connected to 1,3,4,6.\n\n- Node 6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo the tree is like:\n\n2 is connected to 1,3,4,6.\n\n6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo the maximum sum is achieved by removing 1,3,4. The remaining nodes are 2,5,6.\n\nSum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 + 32 +64 = 100.\n\nAlternatively, why not include 6,5,2,3,4? No, because 3 and 4 are being removed. So in that case, the subtree is 2,5,6.\n\nWait, but why not include 6,5,2, and perhaps 3? Because 3 is being removed.\n\nWait, perhaps the selection of which nodes to remove depends on finding a subtree that includes the maximum possible high-d nodes.\n\nIn this case, including 6,5,2, but not 3,4,1.\n\nSo the sum is 4+32+64=100.\n\nWhich is the maximum possible.\n\nSo how did they get that?\n\nBecause 6,5,2, and 3,4,1 were options, but removing the lower ones allows the higher ones to stay.\n\nSo the key is to find a subtree that includes as many high-d nodes as possible, and is connected.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a connected subtree of size (n -k) that includes the maximum possible high-d nodes.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find such a subtree.\n\nHow can this be done efficiently for large n?\n\nPerhaps, the solution involves finding a path in the tree that includes as many high-d nodes as possible, and then including as many descendants as possible.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative approach: The subtree must be connected, so the minimal structure is a tree. To maximize the sum, we need to include as many high-d nodes as possible.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes all nodes above a certain threshold, and is connected.\n\nBut how to find that threshold.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is formed by taking all the nodes that are in a certain subtree of the main tree.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree rooted at node i, which includes all its children, etc., but that's not clear.\n\nAnother idea: Since 2^d is maximum when d is as large as possible, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes the highest possible d's, and their parents, etc., to form a connected component.\n\nSo perhaps, the optimal subtree is the one that includes all the nodes that are in the path from the highest node to some lower nodes, plus any necessary nodes to make it connected.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is a chain that includes the highest node, and as many nodes as possible below it.\n\nBut again, the structure of the tree complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find a subtree that includes the highest (n -k) nodes in a connected way.\n\nBut how to ensure that.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that consists of the nodes from some node u to the root, and the largest possible subtree under u.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to proceed is to find the subtree that includes the maximum number of high-d nodes, and is connected.\n\nTo model this, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that each node can be part of a chain of nodes, and the longer the chain, the more high-d nodes it includes.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother thought: The sum we're trying to maximize is the sum of 2^d for all d in the subtree. Since 2^d grows exponentially, the sum is dominated by the highest d in the subtree.\n\nWait, no. Because even if you have multiple high d nodes, their sum adds up. So, including multiple high d's is better than including just one.\n\nSo, for example, including both d=5 and d=6 is better than including only d=6.\n\nSo the problem is to find a connected subtree with the maximum possible sum of 2^d, which is the same as including as many high d's as possible.\n\nSo, the optimal subtree will consist of a set of high d nodes that are connected.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the optimal subtree is a connected component that includes the top (n -k) nodes in terms of d. So, we need to find a connected subtree that includes these nodes.\n\nBut if these nodes are not connected, we might need to find a way to connect them through lower nodes.\n\nBut this seems vague.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find a subtree that includes all the nodes from some s to t, where s is the smallest node in the subtree and t is the largest, and the size is (n -k). Then, the sum is 2^s + 2^{s+1} + ... + 2^t = 2^{t+1} - 2^s. Which is a large sum.\n\nBut how to choose s and t such that the subtree is connected and has size (n -k).\n\nBut in a general tree, the nodes between s and t may not form a connected subtree.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal solution is to find a path in the tree that includes as many high d nodes as possible, and then select a subtree that includes that path and possibly some other branches.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nHmm. Maybe another way to think about it is to consider the nodes in decreasing order of d. We want to include as many as possible, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n- Start with the highest d node (n). Include it.\n- Then, add the next highest d node that is connected to any node already in the subtree. Continue this until we've included (n -k) nodes.\n\nBut this is a greedy approach. Would it work?\n\nLet me see.\n\nIn the first sample, n=6, k=3. So m = n -k =3. We need to include 3 nodes.\n\nThe highest d nodes are 6,5,4,3,2,1.\n\nBut 6 is connected to 2,5. So, start with 6.\n\nNext, add 5 (connected to 6). Now, count is 2. Next, add 2 (connected to 6). Now, count is 3. So the subtree includes 6,5,2.\n\nSum is 64 +32 +4= 100, which matches the sample.\n\nSo, the approach of greedily adding the next highest d node that is connected to the current subtree works.\n\nAnother test case: in the second sample, input is:\n\n8 4\n\nEdges: 2-6, 2-7,7-8,1-2,3-1,2-4,7-5.\n\nSo the tree is:\n\nLooking at the edges:\n\n1 is connected to 2 and 3.\n\n2 is connected to 1,6,7,4.\n\n7 is connected to 2,8,5.\n\nSo the tree structure is:\n\n1 is connected to 2 and 3.\n\n2 is connected to 4,6,7.\n\n7 is connected to 5 and 8.\n\nSo the tree looks like:\n\n      1\n     / \\\n    2   3\n   / | \\\n  4  6  7\n       / \\\n      5   8\n\nSo for n=8, k=4. So m=4.\n\nWe need to select 4 nodes.\n\nThe highest d nodes are 8,7,6,5, etc.\n\nStart with 8.\n\nBut 8 is connected to 7. So next is 7.\n\nNow, subtree has 8 and7. Count 2.\n\nNext, add 5 (connected to7). Count 3.\n\nThen, add 2 (connected to7). Count4.\n\nSo the subtree is 8,7,5,2.\n\nSum is 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^5 +2^2 = 256 +128 +32 +4 =420.\n\nBut according to the sample output, the second example's output is 1 3 4 5.\n\nWait, that's a different selection. Let me compute the sum for that.\n\nNodes 1,3,4,5.\n\nSum is 2^1 +2^3 +2^4 +2^5= 2+8+16+32=58.\n\nThat's much less than 420. So why is that the sample output?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample. Oh wait, the second sample's input is:\n\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\nWait, wait, perhaps the second input is for a larger n. Or perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I misread the sample.\n\nWait, looking back, the first sample's output is ['1 3 4'], which removes districts 1,3,4. The remaining are 2,5,6, which is 3 nodes (since n=6, k=3: 6-3=3). So that's correct.\n\nThe second sample's output is ['1 3 4 5'].\n\nSo for n=8, k=4: 8-4=4 nodes kept.\n\nWait, the output is four numbers: 1,3,4,5.\n\nWait, what's the sum for those nodes? 2^1 +2^3 +2^4 +2^5 = 2+8+16+32=58.\n\nBut earlier I thought that a better sum exists.\n\nWait, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample's second output is incorrect, but no, it's probably correct for some reason.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is wrong, and the optimal subtree is not necessarily the one that includes the highest possible nodes in a connected way.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find a subtree that includes all the leaves except for certain ones, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as finding a subtree that is connected, and the sum is maximum, with size (n -k). So, the optimal subtree is the one with maximum sum, regardless of the specific nodes, as long as the sum is maximum.\n\nSo, the question is: how to find the connected subtree of size m =n -k that has the maximum sum of 2^d.\n\nThis is a challenging problem.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the solution is to find a subtree that includes as many high d nodes as possible, connected through their parent or child relationships.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: For each node, calculate the size of the subtree rooted at that node. If the size is >=m, then perhaps the subtree can be considered as a candidate.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that is a path, and includes the maximum possible high d nodes.\n\nSo, for each node, compute the maximum number of high d nodes in a path that starts at that node and extends upwards.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that includes the node with the highest d, and all its ancestors up to some point, and as many children as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is similar to finding the maximum sum connected subgraph with a fixed size.\n\nBut I'm not aware of any standard algorithm for this.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that is a star centered at the highest node, including as many of its children as possible, and then their children, etc., until the size is m.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's time to look for hints or similar problems.\n\nUpon thinking, I recall that in some problems, the optimal solution is to find the subtree that includes the highest possible nodes, and is connected. So the approach is to find the subtree that includes the highest (n -k) nodes and is connected.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nWait, another thought: In a tree, the subtree with maximum sum is the one that includes all the nodes that are in some path from the highest node down to some lower node, but this is only possible if the number of nodes in that path is exactly m.\n\nBut that's not always possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is a chain that includes as many as possible high d nodes, and then includes any necessary lower nodes to make the size m.\n\nBut how to find such a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to perform a post-order traversal of the tree, keeping track of the sum and the size of the subtree, and for each node, determine whether including it and its subtree can form a connected component of the required size.\n\nBut given the size of n, this would need to be done efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that is the smallest connected subtree containing all the highest (n -k) nodes.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nHmm. Another angle: since the sum is the sum of 2^d, which is exponential, the subtree that includes the highest d nodes is better. So, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes all the nodes in the top (n -k) d's, and is connected.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a connected subtree that includes the top (n -k) d's.\n\nBut how to find such a subtree.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the minimal subtree that connects all the top (n -k) nodes.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nWait, perhaps the top (n -k) nodes are the highest d's, say, from s to n, where s is such that n -k +1 nodes are in [s, n].\n\nWait, no, because the nodes may not form a continuous range.\n\nFor example, suppose n=10, k=3. So m=7. The top 7 d's are 4-10. But they may not be connected.\n\nSo, the minimal subtree that connects them would require including some lower nodes to connect the higher ones.\n\nBut that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the minimal subtree that connects the top m nodes, which may include some lower nodes.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that is the union of the paths between the top m nodes, but that's not precise.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe problem is to select a connected subtree of size m = n -k.\n\nThe sum of 2^d is maximized when the subtree includes as many high d's as possible.\n\nSo the optimal subtree is the one that includes the highest possible d's, arranged in a connected way.\n\nThus, the approach is to find the largest possible connected subtree that includes the top (n -k) nodes.\n\nBut how to find such a subtree.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to perform a BFS starting from the highest d nodes, adding the next highest d node that is connected to any node in the current subtree, until we have added m nodes.\n\nThis is a greedy approach.\n\nLet me test this approach with the sample.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=6, k=3. m=3.\n\nHighest d nodes are 6,5,4,3,2,1.\n\nGreedy approach:\n\nStart with 6. Count=1.\n\nNext, add 5 (connected to 6). Count=2.\n\nNext, add 2 (connected to 6). Count=3. So the subtree is {6,5,2}.\n\nSum is 64 +32 +4=100, which matches.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=8, k=4. m=4.\n\nHighest d nodes:8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1.\n\nGreedy approach:\n\nStart with 8. Count=1.\n\nNext, add 7 (connected to 8). Count=2.\n\nNext, add 5 (connected to 7). Count=3.\n\nNext, add 2 (connected to7). Count=4.\n\nSubtree is {8,7,5,2}.\n\nSum is 256+128+32+4=420.\n\nBut the sample output is 1,3,4,5.\n\nWhich gives a sum of 2+8+16+32=58.\n\nSo why is the sample output different?\n\nWait, perhaps the greedy approach isn't the correct one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample output is incorrect, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is flawed because sometimes including a lower node that connects more higher nodes is better.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the greedy approach of adding the next highest connected node may not yield the optimal sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample's second case requires a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample's second case is when the tree is more complex, and the optimal subtree is a star shape, not a chain.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that is a path, but that path may include the highest nodes and as many as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires finding the subtree that is a \"chain\" of the highest possible nodes, but I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm a bit stuck. Perhaps I should think about the problem differently.\n\nAlternative Approach:\n\nThe problem is to find a connected induced subgraph (subtree) of size m =n -k, with maximum sum of 2^d.\n\nEach node's contribution is 2^d, which is exponential, so higher d is better.\n\nSo the optimal subtree will consist of the highest possible d's, connected in a way that forms a subtree.\n\nSo the approach is to find the subtree that includes the highest possible d's, ensuring connectivity.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n1. Identify the nodes that need to be included: the top m d's.\n\n2. Ensure that these nodes form a connected subtree.\n\nBut if they don't, we need to include some lower d's to connect them.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to finding a subtree that includes all the top m d's, but if they are not connected, we need to find a way to connect them by including some lower d's.\n\nBut this is not straightforward.\n\nWait, another Idea: Since each node can have multiple children, perhaps the optimal subtree is a collection of the highest d's, all of which are connected through their parents.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes all the highest d's and their immediate parents, ensuring connectivity.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that is a star centered at the highest d node, and includes as many of its children as possible.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's time to look for some code patterns.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the optimal subtree is the one that includes the highest possible d's, and is connected. So the way to find it is to perform a greedy selection of nodes, starting from the highest d, and adding the next highest d that is connected to the current subtree.\n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\n- Sort all nodes in decreasing order of d.\n\n- Initialize a set S as empty.\n\n- Iterate through the sorted list:\n\n   - For each node u, if u is not in S and is connected to any node in S, add u to S.\n\n   - Stop when |S| == m.\n\n- The final S is the desired subtree.\n\nBut does this work for the samples?\n\nIn the first sample:\n\nSorted nodes:6,5,4,3,2,1.\n\nS starts empty.\n\nAdd 6: S={6}, size=1.\n\nNext,5 is connected to 6: add to S. Size=2.\n\nNext,4: not connected to 6. So skip.\n\nNext,3: not connected to 6. Skip.\n\nNext,2: connected to 6. Add to S. Now size=3. Stop.\n\nSo S={6,5,2}, which is correct.\n\nIn the second sample:\n\nSorted nodes:8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1.\n\nS starts empty.\n\nAdd 8: S={8}, size=1.\n\nNext,7: connected to 8. Add. Size=2.\n\nNext,6: connected to 2, but not directly to 7 or 8. So can't add yet.\n\nNext,5: connected to 7. Add. Size=3.\n\nNext,4: connected to 2, not to current S (7,8,5). So can't add.\n\nNext,3: connected to 1, not in S.\n\nNext,2: connected to 1, but not to S.\n\nNext,1: connected to 2, which is not in S.\n\nSo after processing 5, S is {8,7,5}.\n\nBut m=4, so we need one more node.\n\nNext, process 6: Is 6 connected to any node in S (8,7,5)?\n\nLooking at the tree, 6 is connected to 2, which is not in S.\n\nBut 7 is connected to 2, which is not in S.\n\nSo 6 is not connected to any node in S.\n\nSo cannot add 6.\n\nSimilarly, 4 is connected to 2, which is not in S.\n\nSo the next nodes are 3, 2,1, none of which are connected to S.\n\nSo we cannot add any more nodes.\n\nThus, the algorithm stops with S={8,7,5}, size=3, but we need 4.\n\nWait, but m=4, so we need to find four nodes.\n\nBut according to the algorithm, it can't find four.\n\nThus, the algorithm fails.\n\nBut in the sample, the output is 1,3,4,5.\n\nSum is 2+8+16+32=58.\n\nBut according to the algorithm, the sum is 256 +128 +32=416, which is higher.\n\nBut the algorithm can't find four nodes.\n\nSo perhaps the algorithm is incorrect.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the algorithm should allow adding nodes that are not directly connected but are connected via other nodes in the subtree.\n\nWait, but in the case of node 2: it is connected to 7 (since 2 is connected to 7). So when processing node 2, if it's in the sorted list, can it be added?\n\nWait, node 2 is connected to 7, which is in S. So when processing node 2, the algorithm would add it.\n\nSo in the second sample:\n\nAfter adding 8,7,5:\n\nNext, node6: not connected to S. Can't add.\n\nNext, node4: connected to 2, which is not in S. Can't add.\n\nNext, node3: connected to 1, not in S.\n\nNext, node2: connected to 7, which is in S. So add 2. Now S has 4 nodes:8,7,5,2.\n\nThus, the sum is 256+128+32+4=420.\n\nWhich is better than the sample's 58.\n\nBut according to the sample output, the second example's output is 1,3,4,5.\n\nWhich suggests that the algorithm's approach is not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample's second input is not correctly interpreted.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the second sample input.\n\nInput lines:\n\n8 4\n\n2 6\n\n2 7\n\n7 8\n\n1 2\n\n3 1\n\n2 4\n\n7 5\n\nWait, the tree structure:\n\n- 1 is connected to 2 and 3.\n\n- 2 is connected to 1,4,6,7.\n\n- 7 is connected to 2,8,5.\n\nSo node 2 is connected to 1,4,6,7.\n\nSo node 2 is connected to 7.\n\nWhen processing node 2 after 8,7,5, the algorithm can add 2.\n\nSo S becomes {8,7,5,2}.\n\nSum is 256+128+32+4=420.\n\nWhich is better than the sample output.\n\nSo why is the sample output 1,3,4,5?\n\nIs there something wrong with the algorithm?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is that the president can only remove k nodes, and the remaining nodes must form a connected component. So in the second sample, the algorithm's approach would result in a connected component of 4 nodes (8,7,5,2), which is connected. So why is the sample output different?\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the sample is incorrect, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the understanding of the problem.\n\nWait, the problem states that the president wants to remove k contestants, and the remaining districts must form a connected component. So the sum is the sum of 2^d for the remaining districts.\n\nSo in the second sample, the algorithm's approach would result in a sum of 420, which is higher than the sample's 58.\n\nBut the sample output is 1 3 4 5, implying that the president removed 1,3,4,5. So the remaining nodes are 2,6,7,8.\n\nSum is 4+64+128+256=452.\n\nWait, that's higher than 420.\n\nWait, that's confusing.\n\nWait, 452 is higher than 420.\n\nSo perhaps the algorithm's approach is not the optimal one.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample is incorrect, but that's unlikely.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the algorithm should prioritize the inclusion of nodes that have higher degrees, or higher d's in a way that allows more connections.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: The problem is to find a connected subtree of size m, but the sum is the sum of 2^d for the nodes in the subtree.\n\nThus, the optimal subtree is the one with the maximum sum, which may involve including some lower d's that allow higher d's to be included.\n\nIn the second sample, including nodes 2,6,7,8 gives sum 4+64+128+256=452.\n\nIncluding nodes 8,7,5,2 gives 256+128+32+4=420.\n\nSo 452 is better.\n\nSo why is the algorithm's approach not finding this?\n\nBecause the algorithm's approach is to select the nodes in decreasing order of d, but in this case, node 8 is selected first, then 7, then 5, then 2.\n\nBut node 6 is not included.\n\nBut node 6 is connected to 2, which is in the subtree.\n\nSo when processing node 6, it's not in the current S, but is connected to 2, which is in S.\n\nSo when node 6 is processed, it can be added to S.\n\nSo let's re-simulate the algorithm:\n\nn=8, m=4.\n\nSorted nodes:8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1.\n\nProcess 8: add to S. S={8}, size=1.\n\nProcess7: connected to8. Add. S={8,7}, size=2.\n\nProcess6: not connected to 8 or7. Cannot add.\n\nProcess5: connected to7. Add. S={8,7,5}, size=3.\n\nProcess4: connected to2, which is not in S. So cannot add.\n\nProcess3: connected to1, not in S.\n\nProcess2: connected to7. Add. S={8,7,5,2}, size=4.\n\nThus, the subtree is 8,7,5,2.\n\nSum is 256+128+32+4=420.\n\nBut the other option, including 6,7,8,2: sum is 64+128+256+4= 452.\n\nBut why isn't the algorithm including 6?\n\n",
