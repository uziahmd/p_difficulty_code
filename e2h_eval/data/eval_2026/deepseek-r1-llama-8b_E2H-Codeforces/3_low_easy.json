Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Vanya is walking along a street lit by lanterns, and I have to find the minimal radius d such that all points on the street are covered. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each lantern lights a segment of the street from (ai - d) to (ai + d), but considering the boundaries. So for each lantern, the coverage starts at max(0, ai -d) and ends at min(l, ai +d). The goal is to choose d as small as possible so that the union of all these segments covers the entire street from 0 to l.\n\nHmm, so how do I model this? Well, maybe I can think about the street as being divided into intervals by the lantern positions. Then, the minimal d is determined by the gaps between these intervals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to sort the lanterns first. Because if I have the lanterns in order, I can check the coverage between consecutive lanterns and see what d is needed to cover those gaps.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions in increasing order.\n2. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, calculate the distance between them. The minimal required d must be at least half of that distance because the two lanterns' coverage should meet or overlap.\n3. Also, check the start and end: the first lantern's coverage must reach back to 0, so d must be at least the first lantern's position minus 0. Similarly, the last lantern's coverage must reach l, so d must be at least l minus the last lantern's position.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Sort the lanterns.\n- Compute the maximum of:\n   - The first lantern's position (since from 0 to ai[0], d needs to cover 0)\n   - The difference between consecutive lanterns divided by 2, for each pair (since the midpoint between two lanterns determines the minimal d to cover the gap)\n   - The last lantern's position subtracted from l (since from ai[-1] to l, d must cover that)\n- The maximum of all these values will be the minimal d needed.\n\nOh right! Because each of those conditions could impose a necessary d. And the maximum among them will ensure that all areas are covered.\n\nLet me test this logic with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n7 15\nPositions: 15,5,3,7,9,14,0\n\nAfter sorting: 0,3,5,7,9,14,15\n\nNow compute the required d for each part:\n\nBetween 0 and 3: the gap is 3 units. So d needs to be at least 1.5, because 3/2 = 1.5. Because if two lanterns are 3 apart, each covering d, then the coverage from 0 would go up to 0 + d, and from 3 down to 3 -d. To cover the entire 3 units, d >= 3/2.\n\nBut wait, let's see: 0's coverage is [0, d], 3's coverage is [3-d, 3+d]. The gap between 0's end and 3's start is when 0 +d < 3 -d → 2d <3 → d<1.5. So to cover the entire 3 units, d must be >= 1.5.\n\nSimilarly, between 3 and 5: gap is 2. So d needs to be >= 1. So the required d is 1.5 (from the first gap) is larger than 1, so it's okay.\n\nBetween 5 and7: gap 2 → d >=1.\n\nSame for 7-9, gap 2 → d >=1.\n\n9-14: gap 5 → d >=2.5.\n\n14-15: gap 1 → d >=0.5.\n\nAlso, the first lantern is 0: so d must be at least 0 (since 0 -d ≤0). So that's not a constraint.\n\nThe last lantern is 15: l is 15. So 15 -15=0 → no constraint.\n\nWait, but what about the first condition: the first lantern is 0, so to cover from 0 to 0+d. But since we have other lanterns, perhaps their coverage extends beyond. Wait, maybe I should also consider the first lantern's position minus 0. Because if the first lantern is at position x, then without any other lanterns before it, the initial coverage is from x -d to x +d. But since x is the first, x -d must be <=0. So d >=x (since x -d <=0 → d >=x).\n\nSimilarly, for the last lantern, x +d >= l. So d >= l -x.\n\nWait, so",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns on a street light the entire street from point 0 to point \\( l \\). Each lantern lights a segment of the street from \\( (ai - d) \\) to \\( (ai + d) \\), where \\( ai \\) is the position of the lantern.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lanterns**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns in increasing order.\n2. **Calculate Gaps**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them. The minimum \\( d \\) must be at least half of this distance to ensure coverage of the gap.\n3. **Edge Cases**: Check the start and end of the street. The first lantern must cover from 0 to its position, so \\( d \\) must be at least the position of the first lantern. Similarly, the last lantern must cover from its position to \\( l \\), so \\( d \\) must be at least \\( l \\) minus the position of the last lantern.\n\nThe maximum value from these calculations will be the minimum \\( d \\) required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    # Check the first lantern's coverage from 0\n    if a[0] > 0:\n        max_d = max(max_d, a[0])\n    \n    # Check the gaps between consecutive lanterns\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        required_d = gap / 2.0\n        if required_d > max_d:\n            max_d = required_d\n    \n    # Check the last lantern's coverage to l\n    if a[-1] < l:\n        required_d = l - a[-1]\n        if required_d > max_d:\n            max_d = required_d\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to easily check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Gaps Calculation**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the gap is calculated, and the required \\( d \\) is half of this gap.\n3. **Edge Cases Handling**: The first lantern must cover from 0, and the last lantern must cover to \\( l \\), ensuring \\( d \\) is sufficient for these edge cases.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimal \\( d \\) needed to cover the entire street, considering both the gaps between lanterns and the edges of the street.",
