Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the number of valid Morse code substrings after each step of building a string S. Hmm, let's try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that each Morse code letter is represented by a string of 1-4 characters, consisting of 0s and 1s. But not all possible combinations are valid. There are four invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So any substring in S that corresponds exactly to one of these four shouldn't be counted as a valid English letter.\n\nWait, but the problem isn't just about counting valid letters. It's about counting all possible non-empty substrings that represent some valid letter. So for each position in S, I need to look at all possible substrings starting or ending there and check if they form a valid Morse code.\n\nBut considering that m can be up to 3000, a naive approach of checking every possible substring each time would be way too slow. So I need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Maybe I can keep track of the number of valid substrings ending at each position.\n\nYes, that makes sense. For each new character added, I can consider how it forms new substrings with the previous characters.\n\nSo let's define dp[i] as the number of valid Morse code substrings ending exactly at position i. Then, the total number of valid substrings after each step is the sum of dp[0], dp[1], ..., dp[m-1].\n\nWait, but how do I compute dp[i] based on the previous state?\n\nEach time a new character is added (let's say it's c), I can look back at the last 1, 2, 3, or 4 characters. Because Morse code letters can't be longer than 4. So for each possible length l (from 1 to 4), I can see if the substring ending at i with length l is a valid Morse code.\n\nIf it's valid, then I add the count from dp[i-l] to dp[i], because those substrings ending at i-l can now be extended by this new character to form a longer substring.\n\nWait, no. Because dp[i-l] represents the number of valid substrings ending at i-l. So when we add a new character, the new substring from i-l+1 to i is either a new valid substring or not. So for each possible l (1-4), we check if the substring s[i-l+1..i] is valid. If yes, then dp[i] += dp[i-l]. Because each of those dp[i-l] substrings can be extended by this new character to form a new substring ending at i.\n\nWait, but also, the substring from i-l+1 to i itself could be a valid letter, regardless of what came before. So for each l, if the current substring is valid, we add 1 to dp[i] for that substring. But wait, no, because that 1 is already included in the extension. Or maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that for each l (1-4), if the substring s[i-l+1..i] is valid, then dp[i] += dp[i-l] + 1. Wait, no. Let's think differently.\n\nEach time a new character is added, the new substrings ending at i are:\n\n- The substring consisting only of the new character.\n- The substrings formed by appending the new character to each of the substrings ending at i-1, i-2, etc., as long as their combined length is <=4.\n\nSo for example, if the new character is at position i, then for l=1: check if s[i] is a valid single-character Morse code. For l=2: check if s[i-1..i] is valid. And so on up to l=4.\n\nIf a substring of length l is valid, then it contributes dp[i-l] to dp[i], because all the substrings ending at i-l can be extended by this new substring to form a longer valid substring.\n\nWait, maybe another way: for each position i, for l in 1 to min(4, i+1), check if the substring ending at i of length l is a valid Morse code. If it is, then add dp[i - l] to dp[i]. Because each such substring is built upon the previous substrings ending at i-l.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because dp[i] should accumulate the number of new valid substrings ending at i. Each time a new character is added, the new substrings are all the substrings that end here and have length 1, 2, 3, or 4, and are valid.\n\nSo for each l from 1 to 4, if the substring s[i-l+1 ... i] is valid, then we",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of valid Morse code substrings after each modification to a string S. Each modification appends either a dot ('0') or a dash ('1') to S. A valid Morse code substring corresponds to a valid English letter, excluding four specific invalid strings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid Morse code substrings ending at position `i`.\n2. **Check Validity**: For each new character added, check all possible substrings ending at this position with lengths 1 to 4. If a substring is valid, it contributes to `dp[i]`.\n3. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, each update to the DP array is taken modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n4. **Efficient Substring Check**: Maintain a rolling window of up to 4 characters to efficiently check if a new substring is valid.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef is_valid(s):\n    return s not in {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n\nm = int(input())\ns = []\ndp = [0] * m\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(m):\n    c = input().strip()\n    s.append(c)\n    current_sum = 0\n    # Check all possible substrings ending at i with length 1 to 4\n    for l in range(1, 5):\n        if i - l + 1 < 0:\n            break\n        substr = ''.join(s[-l:])\n        if is_valid(substr):\n            dp[i] += dp[i - l]\n            dp[i] %= MOD\n            current_sum += 1\n    # Add the current valid substrings\n    dp[i] += current_sum % MOD\n    dp[i] %= MOD\n    total = (total + dp[i]) % MOD\n    print(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Read the number of modifications and initialize an empty list `s` to build the string incrementally.\n2. **DP Array**: Use an array `dp` where `dp[i]` tracks valid substrings ending at position `i`.\n3. **Substring Check**: For each new character, check substrings of lengths 1 to 4 ending at the current position. If a substring is valid, update `dp[i]` by adding the count from `dp[i-l]` where `l` is the substring length.\n4. **Modulo Handling**: Ensure all operations are done modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to handle large numbers efficiently.\n5. **Output**: After each modification, print the total count of valid substrings modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks valid substrings using dynamic programming and ensures optimal performance even for the maximum constraints.",
