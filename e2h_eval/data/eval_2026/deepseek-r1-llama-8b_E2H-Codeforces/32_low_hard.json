    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. The first thing that comes to mind is that for each possible element to remove, I need to compute the instability of the resulting array and then find the minimum among all those possibilities. But wait, the problem constraints say n can be up to 1e5, which is 100,000. If I try to do this naively, like checking each element by creating a new array each time, that's going to be O(n^2) time, which won't work because 1e10 operations are way too slow.\n\nSo I need a smarter way. Let me see. The key here is to find for each element, what happens when I remove it. What affects the max and min? Well, if the element I'm removing is either the current max or the current min, then removing it might change the overall max or min of the array.\n\nWait, but for other elements, their presence doesn't affect the max or min. So perhaps the optimal choice is to look for the element whose removal reduces the max as much as possible, or increases the min as much as possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal instability after removing an element is determined by the next highest or lowest elements after removing it. So, for each element a[i], I should consider:\n\n- What is the max of the array without a[i]?\n- What is the min of the array without a[i]?\n- Then, compute the difference.\n\nBut calculating this for each i directly would still be O(n^2), which is not feasible.\n\nHmm. So I need to find a way to compute for each i, the max and min when a[i] is excluded quickly.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step is to sort the array. Because sorted arrays make it easier to find the max and min, especially when some elements are removed.\n\nLet me think: if I sort the array, then for each a[i], the new max would be the maximum of all elements except a[i]. Similarly, the new min would be the minimum of all elements except a[i].\n\nBut how do I find the new max and min efficiently?\n\nWait, let's consider the sorted array. For each position i:\n\n- The max when a[i] is removed could be either the previous element (if a[i] was the max) or the same as before if there are multiple max elements.\n- Similarly, the min when a[i] is removed would be either the next element (if a[i] was the min) or the same as before if there are multiple min elements.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the array.\n2. Compute the prefix minima and suffix maxima. Or wait, maybe prefix and suffix minima and maxima?\n   - Wait, no. Let's think: when we remove a[i], the new min is the min of all elements except a[i]. Similarly for max.\n\nBut in a sorted array, the new min could be the first element if a[i] isn't the min. Otherwise, it's the second element. Similarly for max: if a[i] is the max, the new max is the previous one; otherwise, it remains the same.\n\nWait, no. That's not quite right. For example, suppose the array is [1,3,3,7]. If I remove 7, the new max is 3. If I remove one of the 3s, the max remains 7. So for any element that's not the max, removing it doesn't change the max unless all instances of the max are removed.\n\nSo, perhaps for each element a[i], the new max is the maximum of the array excluding a[i]. Similarly for min.\n\nBut computing this for each i in O(1) time would require some preprocessing.\n\nAnother approach: the original max and min are M and m. When I remove an element, the new max is the maximum of the array minus that element, which could be less than M. Similarly, the new min could be greater than m.\n\nBut again, how to find this quickly.\n\nWait, maybe for each element a[i], the potential new max is the maximum of the array after removing a[i]. How can this be computed quickly?\n\nPerhaps precompute for each i, the next maximum and the previous maximum. Alternatively, find for each i the maximum in the array excluding a[i]. Similarly for the minimum.\n\nAlternatively, think about the case where the array has multiple max elements. For example, if the array is [3,3,3], removing any one 3 leaves the max as 3.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the array.\n2. Compute for each i, the maximum and minimum of the array without a[i].\n   - To compute max without a[i",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps efficiently find the maximum and minimum values when an element is removed.\n2. **Compute Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: Create two arrays, `prefix_min` and `prefix_max`, which store the minimum and maximum values up to each index. Similarly, create `suffix_min` and `suffix_max` arrays which store these values from each index to the end.\n3. **Determine New Max and Min**: For each element, if it's the current maximum or minimum, use the next highest or lowest value from the respective prefix or suffix arrays to compute the new instability.\n4. **Calculate Instability**: For each element, calculate the instability by subtracting the new minimum from the new maximum and track the minimum instability across all elements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, *rest = map(int, open(0).read().split())\na = rest[0]\na = list(map(int, a.split()))\na.sort()\n\nprefix_min = [0] * n\nprefix_min[0] = a[0]\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], a[i])\n\nprefix_max = [0] * n\nprefix_max[0] = a[0]\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    prefix_max[i] = max(prefix_max[i-1], a[i])\n\nsuffix_min = [0] * n\nsuffix_min[-1] = a[-1]\nfor i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n    suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], a[i])\n\nsuffix_max = [0] * n\nsuffix_max[-1] = a[-1]\nfor i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n    suffix_max[i] = max(suffix_max[i+1], a[i])\n\nmin_instability = float('inf')\ncurrent_min = a[0]\ncurrent_max = a[-1]\nif n == 1:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\nfor i in range(n):\n    if i == 0:\n        if n == 1:\n            new_min = a[1]\n            new_max = a[1]\n        else:\n            new_min = prefix_min[1]\n            new_max = suffix_max[1]\n    elif i == n-1:\n        if n == 1:\n            new_min = a[0]\n            new_max = a[0]\n        else:\n            new_min = suffix_min[n-2]\n            new_max = prefix_max[n-2]\n    else:\n        if a[i] == prefix_max[i]:\n            new_max_candidate = prefix_max[i-1]\n        else:\n            new_max_candidate = prefix_max[i]\n        if a[i] == suffix_min[i]:\n            new_min_candidate = suffix_min[i+1]\n        else:\n            new_min_candidate = suffix_min[i]\n        new_max = max(new_max_candidate, a[0:n].max() if new_max_candidate < a[0] else new_max_candidate)\n        new_min = min(new_min_candidate, a[0:n].min() if new_min_candidate > a[-1] else new_min_candidate)\n    instability = new_max - new_min\n    if instability < min_instability:\n        min_instability = instability\n\nprint(min_instability)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting the Array**: This allows us to efficiently compute the maximum and minimum values when each element is considered for removal.\n2. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: These arrays help quickly determine the maximum and minimum values in the array excluding the current element, which is crucial for calculating the instability efficiently.\n3. **Iterate Through Each Element**: For each element, compute the new maximum and minimum values using the prefix and suffix arrays. Calculate the instability and track the minimum instability found.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required values in linear time after sorting, making the solution feasible even for large input sizes.",
