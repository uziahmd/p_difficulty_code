There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck but let's try to think through it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on a street with certain spots. Each spot can have a house of height between 0 and h. Each house contributes a squared value to the profit. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in a certain range [l_i, r_i], the tallest house must be at most x_i. My goal is to maximize the total profit by choosing the heights optimally.\n\nHmm. So, how do I model this? It feels like an optimization problem with constraints. The variables are the heights of each spot, and the constraints are the m restrictions.\n\nWait, but with n up to 50, maybe a dynamic programming approach is feasible. Because 50 is manageable for certain DP solutions.\n\nLet me think about the possible states. Maybe for each position i, I can track the maximum possible height given the constraints up to that point. But how?\n\nAlternatively, I can model this as intervals and find for each interval what's the minimum allowed maximum height. Wait, but overlapping intervals complicate things because a spot might be covered by multiple restrictions. For example, a spot could be in two different restrictions, each imposing their own maximum. So, the height for that spot must be the minimum of all those maximums.\n\nSo, perhaps for each spot, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of all x_i where l_i ≤ i ≤ r_i. Additionally, each spot's height cannot exceed h.\n\nWait, yes! Because for a particular spot i, any restriction that includes i will impose that the height at i must be ≤ x_i. So the maximum possible height for spot i is the minimum of all x_i across all restrictions that cover i, but also not exceeding h.\n\nWait, no. Because if a spot is covered by multiple restrictions, say, two restrictions: one says max 5, another says max 3. Then the spot's height must be at most 3. So the effective maximum for spot i is the minimum x_j over all j where l_j ≤ i ≤ r_j, and also min(h).\n\nBut wait, not exactly. Because for a spot i, if it's covered by multiple restrictions, the maximum allowed is the minimum of all x_i's for those restrictions plus possibly h.\n\nWait, no. Each restriction on [l_i, r_i] requires that the tallest in that interval is ≤ x_i. So for each spot in that interval, their heights must be ≤ x_i. So for a spot i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum x of all restrictions that include i. Also, it can't exceed h.\n\nAh, right! So for each spot i, the maximum possible height is the minimum of all x from the restrictions covering i, or h if none. So first, I need to compute for each spot the maximum allowed height based on all applicable restrictions.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely correct. Because some restrictions may have ranges that don't include i, but others do. So for each spot, the maximum allowed is the smallest x among all the restrictions that apply to it, else h.\n\nOnce I know the maximum allowed for each spot, then the problem reduces to choosing a height for each spot (from 0 up to its maximum allowed) such that the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nOh, right! Because once I know the maximum allowed for each spot, the optimal choice for each spot is to set it to the maximum allowed, since higher values contribute more to the sum.\n\nWait, yes. Because for each spot, the square function is increasing. So for a spot with maximum allowed k, the best is to choose k, giving k². Choosing less would give a lower value.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each spot i (from 1 to n), find all the restrictions that include i in their [l_i, r_i] range.\n2. For each such restriction, note its x_i. The maximum allowed height for spot i is the minimum of all these x_i's, and also cannot exceed h.\n3. Once we have the maximum allowed for each spot, the maximum profit is simply the sum of squares of each spot's maximum allowed.\n\nWait, that seems too easy. Let me check the examples.\n\nIn the first example:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1-1, x=1 → spot 1 can be at most 1.\n\n2-2, x=3 → spot 2 can be at most 3.\n\n3-3, x=2 → spot 3 can be at most 2.\n\nSo heights are 1,3,2. Sum is 14. Which matches the sample.\n\nIn the second example:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestriction 1: 2-3, x=8 → spots 2 and 3 are limited",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit possible from building houses on a street with given constraints. Each house contributes to the profit based on its height squared, and there are specific restrictions on the maximum height allowed in certain intervals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem Constraints**: Each spot can have a house with a height between 0 and a given maximum height `h`. There are restrictions that specify the maximum height allowed within certain intervals. The goal is to maximize the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses.\n\n2. **Identify Effective Maximum Heights**: For each spot, the effective maximum height is determined by the minimum value of the maximum allowed heights from all applicable restrictions. This ensures that the tallest house in any interval does not exceed the specified restriction.\n\n3. **Calculate the Profit**: Once the effective maximum heights for each spot are determined, the optimal choice for each spot's height is the maximum allowed height, as this will maximize the contribution to the profit (since the square function is increasing).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nrestrictions = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n\n# For each position, find the minimum x among all applicable restrictions\nmax_heights = [h] * (n + 1)  # 1-based indexing\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    min_x = h\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n        if l <= i <= r:\n            if x < min_x:\n                min_x = x\n    max_heights[i] = min(min_x, h)\n\n# Calculate the total profit\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    total += max_heights[i] ** 2\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of spots, maximum height, and number of restrictions. Each restriction specifies an interval and a maximum height.\n\n2. **Determine Effective Maximum Heights**: For each spot, we check all applicable restrictions. The effective maximum height for each spot is the minimum value of the maximum heights from these restrictions, ensuring compliance with all relevant constraints.\n\n3. **Compute Profit**: By iterating through each spot and squaring the effective maximum height, we sum up the contributions to get the total profit.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the maximum profit by considering each spot's effective maximum height based on the given restrictions, ensuring optimal results within the problem constraints.",
