Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Vanya is walking along a street lit by lanterns, and I have to find the minimal radius d such that all points on the street are covered. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each lantern lights a segment of the street from (ai - d) to (ai + d), but considering the boundaries. So for each lantern, the coverage starts at max(0, ai -d) and ends at min(l, ai +d). The goal is to choose d as small as possible so that the union of all these segments covers the entire [0, l] interval.\n\nHmm, so how do I model this? Well, maybe I can think about the street as being divided into intervals covered by the lanterns, and find the gaps between them. The minimal d will be determined by the largest gap between consecutive lantern coverages.\n\nWait, but the lanterns might not be sorted. Oh right! So first, I should sort the positions of the lanterns. Because otherwise, I might miss some overlapping or the order in which they cover the street.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So step one: sort the array of ai's.\n\nOnce the lanterns are sorted, I can process them in order. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, I can calculate the maximum distance between them, and then determine what the required d would be to cover that gap.\n\nBut wait, each lantern's coverage is a range. So the first lantern covers from 0 to something, the next from something to another point, and so on. The largest gap between two consecutive coverage areas will dictate the minimal d needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the street as being initially completely unlit. Then, each lantern's coverage reduces the unlit regions. But that's more complicated. The initial approach of looking at the gaps between consecutive lanterns seems manageable.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Sort the list of lantern positions.\n2. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between their coverage areas.\n3. The minimal d must be large enough to cover the largest such gap.\n\nWait, but how do I compute the gap between two consecutive lanterns?\n\nSuppose lantern i is at position a_i, and lantern i+1 is at a_{i+1}.\n\nThe coverage of lantern i is [a_i -d, a_i +d], but clipped to [0, l]. Similarly for i+1.\n\nBut since we're trying to find the minimal d, perhaps the worst case is when two lanterns are as far apart as possible without overlapping, requiring the maximum d to bridge the gap between them.\n\nWait, maybe not exactly, because the minimal d is determined by the point where two consecutive lanterns' coverage just touches. Or is it?\n\nNo, perhaps it's the maximum distance between two adjacent lanterns, but adjusted for the street's start and end.\n\nWait, let's think differently. When the lanterns are sorted, the first lantern's leftmost point is max(0, a_0 -d). The second lantern's leftmost point is max(0, a_1 -d), but its rightmost point is a_1 +d. The previous lantern's rightmost is a_0 +d.\n\nSo the coverage after lantern 0 is from a_0 -d to a_0 +d, but if a_0 is near 0, like if a_0 is 0, then the left is 0.\n\nSimilarly, the next lantern's coverage starts at a_1 -d, but if a_1 is larger than a_0 +d, then there's a gap between a_0 +d and a_1 -d. The minimal d must be such that a_0 +d >= a_1 -d, meaning that a_1 - a_0 <= 2d. So d needs to be at least (a_1 - a_0)/2.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because for the two lanterns, their coverage areas must overlap or meet. So for consecutive lanterns, the required d is (distance between them)/2. If that's the maximum over all consecutive pairs, then that's the minimal d.\n\nBut wait, what about the first lantern? Its left coverage is max(0, a_0 -d). It needs to cover from 0 to some point. If a_0 is less than d, then the coverage starts at 0, otherwise, it's a_0 -d.\n\nWait, no. Because a lantern at a_0 with radius d covers up to a_0 +d. So the first lantern's right coverage is a_0 +d. The next lantern's left coverage is a_1 -d. So the gap between the first and second is (a_1 -d) - (a_0 +d) = a_1 - a_0 - 2d. Wait, that can't be right because if a_1 is much larger than a_0, then the gap would be negative, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.\n\nThe first lantern's coverage is from a_0 -d to a_0 +d. But since the street starts at 0, the actual coverage starts at max(0, a_0 -d). Similarly, the coverage ends at min(l, a_0 +d).\n\nSimilarly for the second lantern, it's from max(0, a_1 -d) to min(l, a_1 +d).\n\nWe need the coverage of all lanterns to include the entire [0, l].\n\nSo, the first thing to check is whether the first lantern's coverage includes 0. That is, a_0 -d <= 0, so d >= a_0. Because if a_0 is positive, then d has to be at least a_0 to cover 0.\n\nWait, no. Suppose a_0 is 5, and d is 3. Then the coverage starts at 5-3=2, which is beyond 0, so the coverage doesn't include 0. So for the first lantern to cover 0, we need a_0 -d <=0 → d >= a_0.\n\nSimilarly, the last lantern must cover l. So a_n-1 +d >= l → d >= l - a_n-1.\n\nSo those are two constraints on d.\n\nAdditionally, between any two consecutive lanterns, their coverage areas must not leave a gap. So for lantern i and i+1, the right coverage of i must be >= the left coverage of i+1. So a_i +d >= a_{i+1} -d.\n\nWhich simplifies to a_{i+1} - a_i <= 2d.\n\nSo, the minimal d must satisfy all three conditions:\n\n1. d >= a_0\n2. d >= l - a_{n-1}\n3. For every consecutive pair (i, i+1), d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nCondition 1: To cover 0, the first lantern must have a_0 -d <=0 → d >= a_0.\n\nCondition 2: To cover l, the last lantern must have a_{n-1} +d >= l → d >= l - a_{n-1}.\n\nCondition 3: Between any two consecutive lanterns, their coverage areas must connect. So, the end of i's coverage is a_i +d, and the start of i+1's coverage is a_{i+1} -d. So, a_i +d >= a_{i+1} -d → a_{i+1} - a_i <= 2d → d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2.\n\nSo, the minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n- a_0\n- (l - a_{n-1})\n- the maximum of (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2 for all i from 0 to n-2)\n\nWait, but what if the lanterns are not covering all the way from 0 to l even after considering the above conditions? Like, maybe some lantern in the middle leaves a gap that's larger than the maximum of these three.\n\nNo, I think the three conditions are sufficient. Because if the first lantern's coverage starts at 0, and each subsequent lantern's coverage starts before the previous ends, then the entire street is covered.\n\nWait, but let's take an example.\n\nSuppose we have two lanterns at 0 and 15, and l is 15.\n\nSo a_0 is 0, a_1 is 15.\n\nConditions:\n\n1. d >= a_0 → d >=0.\n2. d >= l - a_1 → 15 -15=0 → d>=0.\n3. (15-0)/2=7.5 → so d must be at least 7.5.\n\nSo the minimal d is 7.5.\n\nBut wait, what happens when d is 7.5?\n\nThe first lantern covers from 0-7.5 to 0+7.5 → 0 to 7.5.\n\nThe second lantern covers 15-7.5=7.5 to 15+7.5=22.5, but since l is 15, it's 7.5 to 15.\n\nSo the combined coverage is from 0 to 15, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 5\n2 5\n\nAfter sorting, a_0=2, a_1=5.\n\nConditions:\n\n1. a_0=2 → d >=2.\n\n2. l -a_1 =5-5=0 → d >=0.\n\n3. (5-2)/2=1.5.\n\nSo maximum of 2, 0, 1.5 is 2.\n\nSo d=2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: say n=1.\n\nIf n=1, then the lantern must cover from 0 to l. So the coverage is [a_0 -d, a_0 +d]. To cover 0, a_0 -d <=0 → d >=a_0.\n\nTo cover l, a_0 +d >=l → d >=l -a_0.\n\nSo d is the maximum of a_0 and l -a_0.\n\nWait, but if a_0 is somewhere in the middle, say a_0 is 3, l is 10. Then d has to be at least 3 to cover 0, and at least 7 to cover 10. So d is 7.\n\nBecause 3+7=10.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions.\n\n2. Compute the initial possible d as the maximum of a[0] and (l - a[-1]).\n\n3. Compute the maximum distance between consecutive lanterns, divide by 2, and compare to the initial d.\n\n4. The minimal d is the maximum of the initial d and this maximum.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute initial_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\nmax_gap = 0\n\nfor i in 0 to n-2:\n\n    current_gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n    half_gap = current_gap / 2\n\n    if half_gap > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = half_gap\n\nfinal_d = max(initial_d, max_gap)\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\n- All lanterns are at 0: then initial_d is 0, but the last condition is l -a[-1] = l. So d must be at least l.\n\nBut wait, if all lanterns are at 0, then to cover the entire street, each lantern covers up to d, but since they are all at 0, the coverage is [0, d]. So d must be at least l.\n\nSo our algorithm would correctly compute initial_d as max(0, l-0)=l. Then, the max_gap between consecutive lanterns (all same) is 0, so final_d is l.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: lanterns are at 0 and l.\n\nThen initial_d is max(0, l - l) =0.\n\nBut the gap between them is l, so half_gap is l/2.\n\nSo final_d is max(0, l/2) → l/2.\n\nWhich is correct because each lantern covers up to d, so 0+d = d, and l-d must be <= d. So l <= 2d → d >= l/2.\n\nSo the algorithm works.\n\nAnother case: lanterns at 0, 5, 10, l=10.\n\nThen initial_d is max(0, 10-10) =0.\n\nMax_gap between 0 and5: 5/2=2.5.\n\nBetween 5 and10: 5/2=2.5.\n\nSo final_d is max(0, 2.5) = 2.5.\n\nWhich is correct because 0's coverage is 0 to 2.5, 5's is 2.5 to 7.5, and 10's is 7.5 to 12.5, but since l is 10, the coverage ends at 10.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when lantern is at 10, with d=2.5, its coverage is 7.5 to 12.5, but since l is 10, it's 7.5 to 10. So the total coverage is 0 to 10, connected.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the algorithm seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo now, the steps for the code:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a's.\n\nSort them.\n\nCompute initial_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]).\n\nCompute max_gap between consecutive a's.\n\nTake the maximum between initial_d and max_gap.\n\nOutput that value with 10 decimal places.\n\nWait, but in code, how to read the input? The input is given as a string, like '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', which is the first line, and the second line is '2 5\\n2 5'.\n\nSo in Python, I can read the first line, split into n and l.\n\nThen the next line is the a's, which may have multiple numbers, including possibly duplicates.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nif n ==0:\n    # but n >=1 per problem statement?\n    # No, problem says 1<=n<=1000.\n\ninitial_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\nmax_gap = 0\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    diff = a[i+1] - a[i]\n    current_gap = diff / 2\n    if current_gap > max_gap:\n        max_gap = current_gap\nfinal_d = max(initial_d, max_gap)\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(final_d))\n\nWait, but what if n is 1?\n\nIn that case, a has one element, a[0], and a[-1] is also a[0].\n\nSo initial_d is max(a[0], l - a[0]).\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo code seems solid.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n7 15\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\ninitial_d = max(0, 15-15) =0.\n\nCompute the gaps:\n\n3-0=3 → gap 1.5\n\n5-3=2 → gap 1\n\n7-5=2 → gap 1\n\n9-7=2 → gap 1\n\n14-9=5 → gap 2.5\n\n15-14=1 → gap 0.5.\n\nSo the max_gap is 2.5.\n\nThus, final_d is max(0, 2.5) =2.5.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n2 5\n2 5\n\nAfter sorting: [2,5]\n\ninitial_d = max(2, 5-5=0) → 2.\n\nGaps:5-2=3 → 1.5.\n\nSo max_gap is 1.5.\n\nFinal_d is max(2, 1.5) → 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, a=[3], l=10.\n\ninitial_d = max(3, 10-3=7) →7.\n\nNo gaps since only one lantern. So d is7.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, a=[0,15], l=15.\n\ninitial_d = max(0, 15-15=0) →0.\n\ngap is15-0=15 → gap 7.5.\n\nSo final_d is7.5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, a=[0,5,10], l=10.\n\ninitial_d = max(0, 10-10=0) →0.\n\ngaps:5-0=5 →2.5; 10-5=5→2.5.\n\nmax_gap is2.5.\n\nso final_d is2.5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWhat about when the lanterns are at the ends, but the initial_d is not the limiting factor?\n\nLike n=2, a=[0,10], l=20.\n\nThen initial_d is max(0, 20-10=10) →10.\n\ngap is10, so gap/2 is5.\n\nSo final_d is max(10,5) →10.\n\nWhich means the first lantern's coverage is 0+10=10, and the second is 10+10=20.\n\nSo the entire street is covered.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nThus, the Python code can be written as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all points on a street are covered by lanterns placed at various positions along the street.
