And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. Hmm, let's see what the problem says.\n\nThe input is n and k, where n is the number of days and k is the number of consecutive days considered a week. Then there's a list of n integers representing each day's sleep time. My task is to compute the average over all possible weeks. Oh right, because each week is a window of k days, and there are (n - k + 1) such windows.\n\nWait, how do I approach this efficiently? Let's think about the steps involved.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the sum for each window of k days. Then, sum all those window sums and divide by the number of windows. That gives the average.\n\nBut wait, if n is up to 2e5, then doing this naively with O(n*k) time would be too slow. So I need a more efficient way.\n\nOh right, the sliding window technique! Because each window after the first is just the previous window minus the element leaving and adding the new element entering.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So I can calculate the initial sum of the first window, then for each subsequent window, subtract the outgoing element and add the incoming one. Then keep a running total of all the window sums.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read n, k and the list a.\n2. Compute the sum of the first window (first k elements).\n3. Add this sum to the total.\n4. For each next window (from i = k to i = n-1):\n   a. Subtract a[i - k] from the current sum.\n   b. Add a[i].\n   c. Add this new sum to the total.\n5. After processing all windows, divide the total by (n - k + 1) to get the average.\n6. Output the average with sufficient precision.\n\nBut wait, what about handling the indices correctly? Let me think: the first window is a[0] to a[k-1], then the next is a[1] to a[k], etc., until a[i] to a[i+k-1]. So for the loop, I start at i = k and go up to i = n-1.\n\nNow, considering that n can be as big as 2e5, this approach should be O(n), which is acceptable.\n\nLet's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 2\n3 4 7\n\nWindows:\n3+4=7\n4+7=11\nTotal sum is 7 + 11 = 18. Number of windows is 2. Average is 9. So output is 9.0000000000. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample:\n1 1\n10 → Only one window, sum is 10. So average is 10. Correct.\n\nThird sample:\n8 2\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nNumber of windows is 8-2+1=7.\n\nSum each window:\n1+2=3\n2+4=6 → sum now 9\n4+100000=100004 → sum 109\n100000+123=100123 → sum 209\n123+456=579 → sum 788\n456+789=1245 → sum 2033\n789+1=790 → sum 2823.\n\nWait, wait, let me calculate step by step.\n\nWait initial sum is a[0]+a[1]=1+2=3.\n\nNext, subtract a[0], add a[2]: 3 -1 +4=6. Sum becomes 3+6=9.\n\nThen, subtract a[1], add a[3]: 6-2=4 +100000=100004. Sum += 100004 → 9+100004=100013.\n\nWait no, wait, the second window is 2+4=6. Third window is 4 + 100000=100004. Fourth is 100000+123=100123. Fifth is 123+456=579. Sixth is 456+789=1245. Seventh is 789+1=790.\n\nAdding all these: 3 +6=9; +100004=100013; +100123=200136; +579=200715; +1245=201,960? Wait, let me compute each step properly.\n\nWait maybe it's better to compute all the window sums:\n\nCompute each window:\n\nIndices (0-based):\n\nwindow 0: 1,2 → sum 3\nwindow 1: 2,4 → 6\nwindow 2:4, 100000 → 100004\nwindow3:100000,123 → 100123\nwindow4:123,456 → 579\nwindow5:456,789 → 124",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks, where each week is defined as a sequence of consecutive days. The goal is to efficiently compute this average given the constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Given `n` days and `k` days per week, we need to consider each possible window of `k` consecutive days. There are `n - k + 1` such windows.\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**: To efficiently compute the sum of each window, we use the sliding window technique. This allows us to compute the sum of each subsequent window in constant time after the initial window.\n3. **Sum Calculation**: Start by computing the sum of the first window. Then, for each subsequent window, adjust the sum by subtracting the element that is leaving the window and adding the new element that is entering the window.\n4. **Total Sum and Average**: Keep a running total of all window sums. After processing all windows, compute the average by dividing the total sum by the number of windows.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    k = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    \n    if k == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n    \n    current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n    total = current_sum\n    for i in range(k, n):\n        current_sum = current_sum - a[i - k] + a[i]\n        total += current_sum\n    \n    avg = total / (n - k + 1)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(avg))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into integers `n`, `k`, and a list `a` of sleep times.\n2. **Initial Window Sum**: Compute the sum of the first window of `k` days.\n3. **Sliding Window Adjustment**: For each subsequent day, adjust the current window sum by removing the outgoing day's sleep time and adding the incoming day's sleep time.\n4. **Accumulating Total Sum**: Keep a running total of all window sums.\n5. **Computing Average**: After processing all windows, compute the average by dividing the total sum by the number of windows and print the result with sufficient precision.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the average in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 200,000 days.",
