Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a plane with n infinite line roads. Each road is given by an equation a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0. These roads divide the plane into blocks. The home and university are in some blocks, not on any road. I need to find the minimal number of steps to get from home to university. A step is moving from one block to another if they share a border of non-zero length. So, moving through a point where two roads cross (an intersection) doesn't count as a step because there's no shared border beyond that point.\n\nHmm. So, the key idea is to model the problem in terms of regions divided by these lines. Each line can split the plane into two parts. The home and university are in certain regions, and the minimal steps would be determined by how these regions are connected via the roads.\n\nWait, but how do the roads affect the regions? Maybe it's helpful to think about each road as a potential separator between regions. For the home and university, we can determine which side of each road they are on. Then, the minimal steps would be based on the number of roads that separate the home and university regions.\n\nSo, for example, if a road has home on one side and university on the other, that road contributes to the separation between them. The minimal number of steps required would be the number of such roads. Because each such road would require crossing it once, and each crossing can be done in a single step by moving through a path that goes around the intersection, but since the movement is along the border, maybe each road you cross adds one step.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each road that separates the home and university regions must be crossed exactly once. So the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of such roads.\n\nYes! So the approach is:\n\n1. For each road, determine whether the home and university are on opposite sides. If yes, increment the count.\n2. The answer is the count of such roads.\n\nThis is because each such road represents a boundary that must be crossed. Since each step can cross multiple such boundaries at once, but in our case, each step can only move between adjacent blocks, which implies crossing one boundary. Wait, no, wait. Wait, perhaps the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of roads that separate the two points. Because each such road must be crossed once, and each crossing can be done in one step.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose there are two roads that cross each other. Home is on one side of both roads, university on the other side of both. So, to get from home to university, you have to cross both roads. How many steps?\n\nIn this case, the home and university are in regions separated by two roads. So, the minimal steps would be 2. Because each road requires a step.\n\nWait, but maybe it's possible to cross both roads in a single step. No, because the movement is along the borders. So, each step moves across a single road. Because if two roads intersect, their shared border is just a point. So, you can't move across both in a single step.\n\nSo, in that case, the minimal steps would indeed be the number of roads that separate the two regions.\n\nTherefore, the solution is to count the number of roads where home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nSo, the steps I need to do are:\n\n- For each of the n roads:\n   - Evaluate the home and university positions relative to the road.\n   - Check if home and university are on opposite sides of the road.\n   - If yes, increment the count.\n\nThe count is the minimal number of steps.\n\nSo, now the problem reduces to determining, for each line, whether the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nHow do I determine that?\n\nFor a line ax + by + c = 0, a point (x0, y0) is on one side or the other based on the value of a*x0 + b*y0 + c. The sign of this value determines which side.\n\nSo, for home (x1,y1), compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c.\nFor university (x2,y2), compute s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n\nIf s1 and s2 have opposite signs, then the home and university are on opposite sides of the road. So, we add 1 to the count.\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read home (x1,y1) and university (x2,y2).\n- Read n, then for each of n lines, read a, b, c.\n- For each line, compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c.\n- Compute s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n- If s1 * s2 < 0, increment count.\n- After processing all lines, output the count.\n\nWait, but what if s1 or s2 is zero? Oh, the problem statement says neither home nor university lies on any road, so s1 and s2 can't be zero. So, the product will never be zero; it's either positive or negative.\n\nSo, that's the approach.\n\nNow, let me think about the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n1 1\n-1 -1\n2\n0 1 0 --> line y = 0\n1 0 0 --> line x = 0\n\nCompute for each line:\n\nLine 1: y=0.\n\ns1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 >0.\ns2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1)+0 = -1 <0.\nSo, they are on opposite sides. Count +=1.\n\nLine2: x=0.\n\ns1 =1*1 +0*1 +0=1>0.\ns2=1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1<0. Opposite sides. Count +=1.\n\nTotal count is 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: \n\nSuppose home and university are on the same side of all roads. Then, steps needed is 0.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that neither home nor university lie on any road, but it's possible that they are in the same region, requiring 0 steps.\n\nWait, but if they are in the same region, then the count is 0 steps.\n\nSo, the code should correctly handle this.\n\nNow, let me think about the constraints.\n\nn can be up to 300, which is manageable.\n\nEach line is processed in O(1) time.\n\nSo, the code should process the input, compute for each line, and sum the count.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\nRead home coordinates: x1, y1.\n\nRead university: x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nInitialize count=0.\n\nFor each of n lines:\n\nread a, b, c.\n\ncompute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 +c.\n\ns2 = a*x2 +b*y2 +c.\n\nif s1*s2 <0: count +=1.\n\nAt end, print count as a string.\n\nYes, that's the code.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nWhat if home and university are same point? Well, problem says \"it is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university lie on the road.\" But nothing about being in the same region. However, if home and university are same, then they are in same region, steps=0.\n\nBut the problem says \"you have to get to the University\", but if home is same as university, perhaps the steps are 0.\n\nBut according to the code, if home and university are same, then for each line, s1 and s2 are same, so s1*s2 is positive, so count remains 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: when a line is vertical or horizontal, but the logic remains same.\n\nNow, handling large values:\n\nx1, y1, etc., can be up to 1e6, but in Python, integers can handle that.\n\nSo, the code should be straightforward.\n\nSo, the Python code would look like:\n\nRead the inputs.\n\nCompute for each line.\n\nSum the count.\n\nPrint the count.\n\nLet me write the code.\n\nWait, the input format: the first line is home, second is university, third is n, followed by n lines.\n\nIn the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings, but in reality, in programming competitions, the input is read as lines.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead x1, y1 from first line.\n\nRead x2, y2 from second line.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each with a, b, c.\n\nIn code:\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if s1 * s2 < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nYes, that's the code.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n1 1\n-1 -1\n2\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nProcessing:\n\nLine 1: 0 1 0 --> y=0.\n\ns1 = 0*1+1*1+0=1.\n\ns2=0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0=-1.\n\n1 * (-1) = -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nLine 2: 1 0 0 → x=0.\n\ns1=1*1 +0*1 +0=1.\n\ns2=1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0= -1.\n\nProduct is -1 <0 → count becomes 2.\n\nOutput is 2.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nHome (0,0), University (2,2). n=1, line x+y=5.\n\nCompute s1=0+0+5=5>0.\n\ns2=2+2+5=9>0. Same side. So count is 0.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSame home and university as before, but line is x+y+3=0.\n\ns1=0+0+3=3>0.\n\ns2=2+2+3=7>0. Same side.\n\nSo steps are 0.\n\nAnother case: home (0,0), university (0,1). Road is x=0.\n\ns1=0 +0 +0=0? No, because home is not on the road. Wait, problem statement says home is not on any road. So in this case, the line is x=0, home is (0,0), which is on the road. So this case is invalid per problem statement.\n\nBut if home is (0,1), university is (0,2), and road is x=0.\n\ns1=0+1*1 +0 =1>0.\n\ns2=0*2 +1*2 +0=2>0. Same side.\n\nSo steps is 0.\n\nAnother case: home (1,1), university (2,3). Road is x=1.\n\ns1 =1*1 +0*1 +1=2>0.\n\ns2=1*2 +0*3 +1=3>0. Same side.\n\nSo steps 0.\n\nRoad is x=2.\n\ns1=2*1 +0*1 +2=4>0.\n\ns2=2*2 +0*3 +2=6>0. Same side.\n\nSteps 0.\n\nBut if road is x=1.5.\n\ns1=1.5*1 +0*1 +1.5= 3>0.\n\ns2=1.5*2 +0*3 +1.5= 4.5>0. Same side.\n\nStill steps 0.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n",

Each step allows moving from one block to another if they share a border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The town is divided into regions (blocks) by several infinite lines. Each line can be represented by an equation of the form \\(ax + by + c = 0\\). The goal is to find how many such lines separate the region containing your home from the region containing your university.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each line, determine whether your home and university lie on opposite sides.
