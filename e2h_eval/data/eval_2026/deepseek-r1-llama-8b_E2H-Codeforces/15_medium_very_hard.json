They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine all winning integers x in a tournament setup. The tournament is structured in a way similar to a single-elimination bracket, and the outcome of each game depends on the string s given.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the tournament has 2^n teams. They play 2^n - 1 games. The structure is such that in each phase i (from 1 to n), there are 2^{n-i} games. For example, the first phase has 2^{n-1} games, pairing the teams as 1v2, 3v4, etc. Each game eliminates one team, so after the first phase, half remain.\n\nThe second phase groups winners from the first phase into larger brackets. For instance, in phase 2, each group is the winner of two previous games. So, for phase 2, the winners from phase 1's pairs form new matches, like (winners of 1v2 vs 3v4), and so on.\n\nEach game's outcome is determined by the corresponding character in the string s. If s_i is '0', then in phase i, the lower-skilled team wins. If it's '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nThe task is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p of skills (so p is a rearrangement of 1..2^n) where team x wins the tournament.\n\nHmm. So I need to model the possible paths a team can take through the tournament based on the rules of each phase and the conditions given by the string s.\n\nMy approach should be to model the tournament as a binary tree, where each node represents a match, and each edge represents a team advancing or being eliminated. But since the number of teams can be up to 2^18, which is 262144, that's way too big to model directly.\n\nWait, but n can be up to 18, which implies 2^18 = 262144 teams. That's a lot. So any brute-force approach is probably not feasible. So we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tournament. It's a binary elimination tournament. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half, grouping them into matches. The key is that in each phase, the teams are grouped into pairs, and each pair plays, with the winner moving on to the next phase.\n\nBut the way the pairs are formed changes depending on the phase. For example, in phase 1, the initial matches are 1v2, 3v4, etc. In phase 2, the winners of 1v2 and 3v4 face off, etc. So the structure isn't a fixed binary tree but more like a complete binary tree where each level corresponds to a phase.\n\nWait, perhaps each phase is a level in the binary tree. The first phase is the leaves, then each next phase is the parents.\n\nSo for the tournament structure, the first phase (phase 1) has all the initial matches, then phase 2 combines the winners, and so on until phase n, where only one team remains.\n\nEach phase i has 2^{n-i} matches. So for phase i, the number of matches is 2^{n-i}, and the number of teams remaining is 2^{n - i}.\n\nNow, the challenge is to model for each position in the tournament, what constraints does the string s impose on the possible winners.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the tournament as a series of rounds, where in each round, certain teams must win based on the s string.\n\nWait, maybe we can model the tournament as a set of constraints on the relative strengths of the teams. Because the outcome of each game depends on whether a higher or lower skill team wins, the tournament's results are determined by the permutation p and the string s.\n\nSo, for each phase i, each match in that phase will have a winner. The winner must satisfy the condition given by s[i]. For example, if s[i] is '0', then the winner is the team with lower skill; if '1', the higher.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all x such that x can be the overall winner under some permutation p that satisfies all these constraints.\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be modeled using dynamic programming or memoization, tracking for each possible subset of teams, what their possible orderings are. But that seems infeasible because the subsets are too large.\n\nAnother idea: The tournament's structure can be represented as a binary tree. Each internal node represents a match, and the leaves are the initial teams. The root is the final match determining the champion.\n\nFor each node in this tree, we can determine the necessary conditions for a particular team to reach that node and win.\n\nWait, that might be manageable. Let's model the tournament as a binary tree where each non-leaf node has two children (the two teams that played in that match). The leaves are the initial teams.\n\nThen, for each node, we can represent the required conditions for a team to reach that node and win. Then, the root node would represent the entire tournament, and any team that can reach the root as a winner under the given s string is a possible champion.\n\nBut how to model the conditions for each node?\n\nEach node corresponds to a match in a specific phase. Let's say for a match at depth d (with the root being depth n, and each level going down by one), the phase is (n - (depth-1)) ?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think: phase 1 is the first set of matches, phase 2 is the next, etc., until phase n, which is the final match.\n\nEach phase has 2^{n - i} games, where i is the phase number (starting from 1). So for example, if n=3, phase 1 has 4 games, phase 2 has 2, phase 3 has 1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 2^3=8 teams. Phase 1 has 4 games (since 8/2=4), phase 2 has 2 games (4/2), phase 3 has 1 game (2/2). So yes, phase i has 2^{n-i} games.\n\nNow, each phase corresponds to a certain level in the tournament's binary tree.\n\nWait, perhaps each match in phase i is a node at a certain depth. Let me think: the initial matches (phase 1) are leaves. Then, the winners of those form phase 2's matches, which are the next level up, and so on until the final match (phase n) is the root.\n\nSo for each match, its depth in the tree determines which phase it is in.\n\nAlternatively, each match is part of a certain phase. So for each phase i, we can determine the structure of the matches.\n\nBut how do the s string's bits affect the possible winners?\n\nIn phase i, for each match, the winner must satisfy s[i]. So for each match, during phase i, if s[i] is '0', the winner is the team with lower skill. If '1', the winner is the higher-skilled team.\n\nBut the permutation p is a bijection, so the actual mapping from team numbers to their skills is a permutation.\n\nSo for each match in phase i, the winner must be either the lower or higher skill, depending on s[i].\n\nNow, the key insight is that for a team to win the tournament, it must win all matches it participates in, and for each of those matches, the outcome must comply with s[i] for the respective phase.\n\nSo the problem is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where, for every match that x plays in, the outcome is correct according to s.\n\nHmm. So how can we model this?\n\nPerhaps we can model for each possible team x, whether it's possible to arrange the other teams in such a way that x wins all its required matches, given the constraints of each phase.\n\nBut considering that the tournament's structure is fixed, perhaps we can model the required constraints on the relative skills of the teams.\n\nWait, let's think about the structure of the tournament as a binary tree, and for each node (match), determine the required comparison between the two teams that meet there.\n\nEach match in phase i corresponds to a node in the binary tree. For each such node, the winner must have a certain relationship to the other participant, based on s[i].\n\nSo for a given node (match), in phase i, if s[i] is '0', the winner is the team with lower skill. So the winner must be less than the loser in terms of skill. If s[i] is '1', the winner is the higher-skilled team.\n\nThus, for each match in the tournament tree, we can assign a constraint on the two teams that participate in it: either the winner is less than the loser or greater than.\n\nThis forms a system of inequalities that the permutation p must satisfy.\n\nThe problem then reduces to checking if there exists a permutation of the numbers 1..2^n such that all these inequalities are satisfied for the path that the winning team takes through the tournament.\n\nSo, for a team x to be the champion, it must be the winner of all the matches along its path from the leaf to the root.\n\nEach match along this path imposes a constraint on x and another team y, based on the phase in which the match occurred.\n\nThus, for x to be a possible champion, all these constraints must be satisfied, and the permutation must be such that for each match x participates in, the required winner is x, and the constraints are met.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Model the tournament as a binary tree. Each node is a match in a phase. The leaves are the initial teams.\n\n2. For each node (match), determine the phase i it's in, which tells us the constraint (s[i]).\n\n3. For each team x, trace the path from x's initial leaf to the root. Collect all the constraints imposed by each match along this path.\n\n4. For x to be a possible winner, the permutation must satisfy all these constraints, meaning that for each match in x's path, the winner is x, and x must be either higher or lower than the other team, depending on s[i].\n\nSo, for each x, we need to check whether it's possible to assign the other teams' skills in such a way that all the constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut how do we model these constraints efficiently?\n\nThis seems like a problem that could be approached with bitmasking and dynamic programming. However, with n up to 18, the total number of teams is 2^18=262144, which is manageable only if we can find an efficient way.\n\nWait, but for each x, we can model the constraints as a directed graph of inequalities. For example, for each match in x's path, if s[i] is '1', then x must be greater than the other team in that match. If s[i] is '0', x must be less than the other team.\n\nSo, for each x, the constraints are a set of inequalities involving x and other teams. We need to determine whether there's a permutation where all these inequalities are satisfied, and the other teams can be arranged in a way that doesn't violate any other constraints.\n\nWait, but the other teams also have their own constraints from the matches they must win to proceed further.\n\nNo, wait. Only x's path is considered. Because, once x wins a match, the other team is eliminated. So the other teams don't have any constraints beyond their matches against x.\n\nWait, that's not accurate. Because in a match, both participants are determined by the structure of the tournament. So, for example, if x is in a match against y, then y must have won all their previous matches to reach that point. So y's path to the match also has constraints.\n\nBut for the purposes of x's eligibility, perhaps we can model the minimal constraints that x must satisfy, regardless of what happens elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for x to be a possible winner, the constraints from x's path are sufficient to ensure that a valid permutation exists.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because other teams' constraints may require certain relationships that conflict with x's constraints.\n\nBut maybe the constraints from x's path are sufficient to allow for a valid permutation, assuming that the other teams can be arranged in a way that doesn't interfere.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative approach: For each x, build a directed graph of required inequalities based on x's path. Then, check whether this graph is possible under a permutation.\n\nBut how?\n\nEach match in x's path requires that x is either greater or less than another team, depending on s[i].\n\nWe can model this as a directed graph where edges represent \"must be less than\" or \"must be greater than\".\n\nFor example, if in a match, x is the winner and s[i] is '0', then x must be less than the other team. So we add an edge from x to the other team, indicating x < y.\n\nIf s[i] is '1', then x must be greater than the other team, so we add an edge from y to x, indicating y < x.\n\nOnce we've built this graph for x, the question is whether this graph is a DAG and whether a topological sort exists where all the constraints are satisfied.\n\nMoreover, the graph must be such that when we assign values to the nodes (the permutation), the constraints are met.\n\nWait, but building this graph for each x is computationally expensive because x can be up to 2^18, which is 262,144. So for each x, building a graph and checking for a possible permutation is O(2^18 * (2^18)^2), which is way too slow.\n\nThus, this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Maybe the problem can be represented as a binary decision diagram, where for each node, the constraints are enforced, and we can find whether a valid assignment exists.\n\nBut again, this seems computationally heavy.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the constraints as a partial order and determine if it's possible to extend this partial order to a total order that is a permutation.\n\nIn other words, for each x, the constraints from x's path define a set of relations (x < y or x > y). We need to check if these relations can be part of a total order.\n\nThis is known as the problem of checking if a directed graph is a comparability graph, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each x, the constraints form a set of inequalities that must hold in the permutation. We can model this as a directed graph, and then check if this graph is a DAG and whether it's possible to assign values to the nodes such that all edges are respected.\n\nBut again, for n=18, this is computationally challenging.\n\nWait, perhaps the constraints for each x can be represented in terms of a bitmask, where each bit represents a team that must be either higher or lower than x.\n\nBut I'm not seeing it immediately.\n\nAnother angle: Think recursively. For each phase, determine the necessary conditions for x to reach that phase's match.\n\nFor example, in the final phase (phase n), the match is between two teams. For x to win that, x must satisfy s[n], which determines whether x is higher or lower than the other participant.\n\nBut who is the other participant? It depends on the structure of the tournament.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure of the tournament is fixed, and the only variable is the permutation p. So, the tournament's structure is a fixed binary tree, and the permutation defines the skills of the teams.\n\nThus, the problem is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x wins all the matches along its path, and the outcomes of each match comply with s[i].\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a binary decision tree, where for each match in x's path, we know whether x must be higher or lower than another team.\n\nThus, for x to be a possible winner, all the constraints along x's path must be compatible.\n\nBut again, the issue is handling all possible x and their constraints.\n\nAlternative Idea: The tournament structure is a fixed binary tree. For each node (match) in this tree, the phase i determines the constraint s[i].\n\nThus, for each x, we can precompute all the constraints that x must satisfy in each match along its path to the root.\n\nOnce we have these constraints, we need to determine if it's possible to assign the permutation p such that all these constraints are satisfied.\n\nEach constraint is a relation between x and another team y: either x < y or x > y.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the constraints as a directed graph and then check if this graph is a DAG. If it is, then a topological sort exists, which can be used to assign the permutation.\n\nBut even then, for each x, building the graph is O(2^n) time, which is not feasible for n=18.\n\nHmm. So perhaps we need a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that the tournament's structure enforces certain dependencies on the permutation. For example, in each match, the winner must be either the higher or lower skilled team, based on s[i].\n\nThus, the tournament can be viewed as a series of comparisons that must be satisfied.\n\nAnother Idea: For each phase i, the matches are grouped into blocks of size 2^{i}. For example, in phase 1, the matches are 1v2, 3v4, etc. In phase 2, the winners of 1v2 and 3v4 play, and so on.\n\nWait, no. Wait, phase 1 has 2^{n-1} matches. Phase 2 has 2^{n-2} matches, each consisting of two winners from phase 1. So for each phase i, the matches are formed by combining the winners of two sub-matches from phase i-1.\n\nThus, the structure is a binary tree where each node has two children, except the leaves, which are the initial teams.\n\nSo, for each match in phase i, its two children are the two sub-matches from phase i-1 that feed into it.\n\nGiven this structure, each match in phase i is determined by the two matches in phase i-1 that produce its participants.\n\nThus, the constraints propagate up the tree. For example, if in phase i, a match's winner is x, then x must be either higher or lower than the other participant, depending on s[i].\n\nBut the other participant is the winner of two sub-matches from phase i-1. So, for x to win in phase i, it must satisfy the constraints from phase i's match and the constraints from the sub-matches that produced its opponent.\n\nThis suggests that the constraints are hierarchical and can be represented in a tree structure.\n\nBut again, with n up to 18, this approach might be computationally intensive.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the problem using memoization and recursion, keeping track of the required constraints for a particular match.\n\nLet me think: For a given match (node) in phase i, and a possible winner x, can x win this match given the constraints from the sub-matches and the s[i] value?\n\nIf yes, then we can proceed to the parent node (the match that x would face in the next phase). Otherwise, x cannot be the overall winner.\n\nSo, for each match node, we can determine whether x can be the winner of that node, given the constraints from its children.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nHmm.\n\nLet's model this recursively. For a given match m (which is in phase i), and a team x, we can determine whether x can be the winner of m, given the constraints from the sub-matches.\n\nThe function would return true or false.\n\nThe base case is when m is a leaf (initial team). Then, x must be that team, so it's possible only if x is the team in the leaf.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial teams are leaves, and each leaf is a team. So for a leaf node, if x is the team in the leaf, then it's possible (assuming no constraints, but in reality, the leaf doesn't have any constraints because it's the starting point).\n\nWait, perhaps the base case is when the match is a leaf, so x must be the team in the leaf. So for a leaf node, the only possible winner is the team in the leaf. So for a non-leaf node, the function returns true if x can win against the other child, considering the phase's s[i].\n\nWait, perhaps for a node m in phase i, which has two children c1 and c2, the function is:\n\ncan_win(x, m) = can_win(x, c1) and can_win(opponent, c2) where opponent is the other child, but x must satisfy the constraint based on s[i].\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because in match m, the two participants are the winners of c1 and c2. So x must be the winner of m, which requires that x beats the winner of c2 (if c1 is x's side). Or something like that.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each match, the two participants are the winners of its two children. So for x to win match m, x must be the winner of m, which requires that x beats the other participant.\n\nThe other participant is determined by the winners of the two children of m. So, for each child c1 and c2 of m:\n\nIf x is the winner of c1, then the other participant is the winner of c2, which must be such that x can beat them according to the constraints of m's phase.\n\nAlternatively, if x is the winner of c2, then the other participant is the winner of c1, and x must beat them according to m's phase.\n\nWait, perhaps for a match m, the two participants are a and b, and x must be either a or b. Then, for x to win m, it must satisfy the constraint based on s[i].\n\nBut how do we model a and b?\n\nAlternatively, for a match m in phase i, the two participants are the winners of its two children. So, if x is the winner of m, then x must be the winner of either c1 or c2, and the other participant must be the winner of the other child.\n\nThus, for x to win m, x must be able to win in c1 or c2, and the other child's winner must be compatible with the constraint s[i].\n\nThis suggests that for each match m, the possible winners are the ones that can win in either of its children, provided that the constraint is satisfied.\n\nSo, the function can be defined as:\n\ndef can_win(x, m):\n    if m is a leaf:\n        return x == m's team\n    # get the two children of m\n    c1, c2 = m.left, m.right\n    # case 1: x is the winner of c1, then the other participant is the winner of c2\n    if can_win(x, c1) and can_win(other, c2) where other must be a team that x can beat in phase i.\n    # case 2: x is the winner of c2, and the other participant is the winner of c1, and x must beat them.\n    # determine the required condition for x to beat the other participant based on s[i]\n    # if s[i] is '0', x must be < other\n    # if s[i] is '1', x must be > other\n\nWait, but in the function, x can be either the winner of c1 or c2. So we need to check both possibilities.\n\nSo, for match m, to see if x can be the winner, we have two options:\n\nOption 1: x comes from c1, and the other participant is the winner of c2. So x must be able to win in c1, and the winner of c2 must be a team that x can beat according to s[i].\n\nOption 2: x comes from c2, and the other participant is the winner of c1. Similarly, x must be able to win in c2, and the winner of c1 must be a team that x can beat according to s[i].\n\nSo, for each option, we need to check whether x can win in c1 or c2, and whether the other participant meets the required condition.\n\nBut wait, the other participant's condition is determined by x's ability to beat them in the match m. So for option 1, the other participant is the winner of c2. Let's call that y. Then, in match m, since s[i] determines whether x must be higher or lower than y.\n\nSo, for x to be the winner of m, in option 1:\n\n- x must be able to win in c1 (i.e., x is a possible winner of c1)\n- y (winner of c2) must be such that, in match m, x beats y according to s[i]\n\nSimilarly for option 2.\n\nThus, the function can_win(x, m) is true if either:\n\n1. x can win in c1, and the winner of c2 (y) is such that x beats y according to s[i].\nOR\n2. x can win in c2, and the winner of c1 (y) is such that x beats y according to s[i].\n\nSo, the function can_win(x, m) is true if either of the above is possible.\n\nBut how do we determine y for each case?\n\nBecause y is determined by the winner of c2 (or c1), which is another team. But without knowing the permutation p, we can't directly compute y's value.\n\nThus, this suggests that the problem is interdependent and cannot be solved purely with memoization.\n\nAlternative Idea: Instead of trying to model this recursively, perhaps we can model it as a binary decision at each node, where we track the possible constraints on x relative to the other teams.\n\nWait, but I'm not seeing a clear way forward here.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the tournament's structure is fixed, perhaps the possible winners can be determined by considering the phases and the constraints in a bottom-up manner.\n\nFor example, in the first phase (leaves), each match has two teams, and the winner is determined by s[1]. Then, in phase 2, each match is between the winners of two phase 1 matches, and so on.\n\nThus, for each phase, we can model the possible winners based on the constraints of the current phase and the possible winners of the sub-matches.\n\nWait, this might be a feasible approach.\n\nLet me elaborate:\n\nPhase 1: Each match is between two teams, and the winner is determined by s[1]. So for each initial match, the winner is either the lower-skilled team (if s[1] is '0') or the higher-skilled team (if s[1] is '1').\n\nSo, for phase 1, we can model for each initial match, the possible winners. Then, for phase 2, each match is between two winners from phase 1, and so on.\n\nAt each phase, for each match, we can track the possible winners, given the winners from the sub-matches and the current phase's constraint s[i].\n\nIf we can model this, then for phase n (the final match), the possible winners are the possible champions.\n\nThus, the approach is:\n\n1. Represent the tournament as a binary tree, where each node is a match, and each node has two children (the sub-matches).\n\n2. For each phase i (from 1 to n), process each match in that phase, determining the possible winners based on the sub-matches' possible winners and s[i].\n\n3. After processing all phases, collect all the possible winners from the root node.\n\nBut how do we represent the possible winners for each match?\n\nEach match's possible winners can be represented as a set of possible team indices. For each match, we can compute this set based on the sets of possible winners from its two children and the current phase's s[i].\n\nSo, for a match m in phase i, the two participants are the winners of c1 and c2 (its children). The possible winners of m are the possible winners of c1 and c2 that satisfy the constraint s[i].\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nFor a match m in phase i:\n\n- Let A be the set of possible winners of c1.\n- Let B be the set of possible winners of c2.\n- Then, the possible winners of m are the union of two cases:\n   a) x is in A, y is in B, and x can beat y according to s[i].\n      In this case, x is the winner of m.\n   b) y is in A, x is in B, and y can beat x according to s[i].\n      Then, y is the winner of m.\n\nWait, but in case a, x is the winner of m, so we need to consider all x in A where x can beat some y in B according to s[i].\n\nSimilarly, in case b, y is the winner of m, so y must be in B and must beat some x in A according to s[i].\n\nWait, but this isn't quite right. Because for a match m, the two participants are the winners of c1 and c2, but which one is which depends on how they were paired.\n\nAh, right, because in phase i, the matches are grouped in a certain way. For example, in phase 2, the matches are between the winners of the first two phase 1 matches, then the next two, etc.\n\nWait, no. Wait, phase 2 has 2^{n-2} matches. Each match in phase 2 is between the winners of two consecutive phase 1 matches.\n\nSo for example, the first match in phase 2 is between the winner of match 1 (phase 1) and the winner of match 2 (phase 1). The next match is between the winner of match 3 and the winner of match 4, and so on.\n\nThus, for a match m in phase i, its two children are the two phase i-1 matches that precede it in the same group.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is that for a match m in phase i, the two participants are the winners of two matches from phase i-1, which are adjacent in some way.\n\nWait, perhaps not. For phase i, the matches are formed by taking the winners of phase i-1 matches in pairs. So, for phase 2, the first match is between the winners of the first and second phase 1 matches, the next between third and fourth, etc.\n\nThus, for a match m in phase i, the two children are the two phase i-1 matches that are adjacent in the groupings of phase i-1.\n\nBut perhaps this is not necessary for the algorithm, as long as we can correctly pair the phase i-1 matches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the structure as a binary tree, where each node's two children are the two phase i-1 matches that contribute to it.\n\nThus, for each match m in phase i, the two children are the two phase i-1 matches that feed into it.\n\nSo, for the purpose of the algorithm, each match m in phase i has two children, which are the two matches from phase i-1 that form the participants for m.\n\nThus, for the algorithm, we can represent the tournament as a binary tree, and for each match, compute the possible winners based on the possible winners of its two children and the current phase's s[i].\n\nThus, the algorithm would proceed as follows:\n\n1. Build the tournament structure as a binary tree, where each node represents a match, and each non-leaf node has two children representing the two sub-matches that feed into it.\n\n2. For each match, starting from the leaves (phase 1) up to the root (phase n), compute the set of possible winners.\n\n3. For each match in phase i:\n   a. Get the possible winners from the two children (c1 and c2).\n   b. Compute all possible pairs (x, y) where x is from c1's possible winners, y is from c2's possible winners.\n   c. For each pair (x, y), determine if x can win against y in the current phase's match (based on s[i]).\n   d. Also, consider the case where y can win against x in the current phase's match.\n   e. The union of all possible x's that can win against some y, and vice versa, gives the possible winners for the current match m.\n\nWait, but this seems like it's considering all possible x and y from the children, which could be a lot. For each match, the number of possible winners could be up to 2^{n-1}.\n\nBut perhaps for each match, the number of possible winners is manageable, especially since for each match, the possible winners are constrained by the previous phases.\n\nWait, but for n=18, the number of matches is 2^18 - 1, which is about 260,000. For each match, if the possible winners are stored as a set, and for each pair of children, the possible winners are combined, this could be manageable.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the data structures. For each match, we can store a list of possible winners. Initially, the leaves have exactly one possible winner: themselves.\n\nThen, for each phase from 1 to n, we process each match in that phase.\n\nProcessing a match m in phase i involves:\n\n- Getting the possible winners of its two children, c1 and c2.\n- For each possible winner x in c1, and for each possible winner y in c2:\n   - Check if x can beat y according to s[i-1] (since phases are 1-based, but our loop is 0-based perhaps).\n   - If x can beat y, then x is a possible winner of m.\n   - Similarly, if y can beat x, then y is a possible winner of m.\n- Thus, the possible winners of m are all x that can beat some y in c2 (for x in c1) or some x in c1 (for y in c2).\n\nWait, but in this approach, for each match m in phase i, the possible winners are the union of x in c1 where x can beat some y in c2, and y in c2 where y can beat some x in c1.\n\nBut wait, this is considering all possible combinations, which might be too slow for n=18.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each match m, the possible winners are the union of two sets:\n\nA: For all x in c1, and y in c2, if x can beat y, then x is a possible winner of m.\n\nB: For all x in c1, and y in c2, if y can beat x, then y is a possible winner of m.\n\nWait, but this would include all x in c1 that can beat at least one y in c2, and all y in c2 that can beat at least one x in c1.\n\nThus, the possible winners of m are all x in c1 ∪ c2 that can beat someone in the other set, plus all y in c2 ∪ c1 that can beat someone in the other set.\n\nBut this is not correct. Because for a match, only one of the two participants can win.\n\nWait, no. Because for a match m, the two participants are the winners of c1 and c2. So, in match m, x and y are the participants, and only one can win.\n\nThus, for m to have x as a possible winner, x must be able to beat y, where y is a possible winner of c2.\n\nSimilarly, y must be able to beat x.\n\nThus, for the match m, the possible winners are all x in c1 that can beat some y in c2, and all y in c2 that can beat some x in c1.\n\nWait, no. Because in a match, only one of the two participants can win. So, for each pair (x, y), where x is from c1 and y is from c2, either x can beat y (so x is a possible winner of m), or y can beat x (so y is a possible winner of m).\n\nThus, for m, the possible winners are the union of all x in c1 that can beat some y in c2, and all y in c2 that can beat some x in c1.\n\nBut that's not precise. For a particular x in c1 and y in c2, if x can beat y, then x is a possible winner of m. Similarly, if y can beat x, then y is a possible winner of m.\n\nThus, for all x in c1, if there exists any y in c2 such that x can beat y according to s[i], then x is a possible winner of m.\n\nSimilarly, for all y in c2, if there exists any x in c1 such that y can beat x according to s[i], then y is a possible winner of m.\n\nThus, the possible winners of m are all x in c1 ∪ c2 that can beat someone in the other set, and all y in the other set that can beat someone in the first set.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nAnother Idea: For each match m, the possible winners are the intersection of the two sets:\n\nSet A: {x | x can beat at least one y in c2}\nSet B: {y | y can beat at least one x in c1}\n\nBecause for m, the winner must be either in A (beating someone from c2) or in B (beating someone from c1).\n\nWait, but Set A is x in c1 that can beat someone in c2, and Set B is y in c2 that can beat someone in c1.\n\nThus, the possible winners of m are the union of Set A and Set B.\n\nBut computing this for each match m is computationally expensive because for each pair (x, y) in c1 × c2, we need to check if x can beat y or y can beat x.\n\nThis is O(k^2) per match, where k is the number of possible winners in each child. For n=18, each phase could have up to 2^17 possible winners, leading to 2^34 operations per match, which is way too slow.\n\nThus, this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Find a way to represent the possible winners in a way that allows us to quickly compute the possible winners for a match without checking all pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps for each match, the possible winners can be represented as the bitwise OR of the possible winners from each child,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all winning integers x in a tournament setup where each match's outcome is determined by a given string. The tournament structure is a binary elimination tree, and the goal is to identify all possible winners based on the constraints provided.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament can be represented as a binary tree where each node represents a match. Each non-leaf node has two children representing the sub-matches that feed into it.\n2. **Phase Constraints**: Each phase of the tournament has a constraint given by the string `s`. If `s[i]` is '0', the lower-skilled team wins; if '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n3. **Possible Winners Calculation**: For each match, starting from the leaves (phase 1) up to the root (phase n), compute the set of possible winners based on the constraints of the current phase and the possible winners from the sub-matches.\n4. **Bottom-Up Processing**: Process each phase from 1 to n, updating the possible winners for each match based on the outcomes of the sub-matches and the current phase's constraint.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Build the tournament structure as a binary tree\n    # Each node is a dictionary with 'left' and 'right' children\n    # Leaves are at level 1 (phase 1)\n    tree = {}\n    for i in range(1 << n):\n        tree[i] = {'left': None, 'right': None}\n    \n    # Assign children to each node in a bottom-up manner\n    level = 0\n    for i in range(1 << n):\n        # Determine the phase for this node\n        phase = n - level\n        if phase == 0:\n            # This is the root, no children\n            continue\n        if phase == 1:\n            # Leaf nodes, they have no children\n            continue\n        # Compute the left and right children indices\n        left = i - (1 << (n - phase - 1))\n        right = left + (1 << (n - phase - 1))\n        tree[i]['left'] = left\n        tree[i]['right'] = right\n        level += 1\n    \n    # Initialize possible winners for each leaf (phase 1 matches)\n    possible_winners = {}\n    for i in range(1 << (n)):\n        possible_winners[i] = set()\n        possible_winners[i].add(i)\n    \n    # Process each phase from phase 1 to phase n\n    for phase in range(1, n+1):\n        current_level = []\n        for i in range(1 << n):\n            if (i >> (n - phase)) & 1:\n                continue  # Skip non-leaves until the current phase\n        for i in range(1 << n):\n            if phase > n:\n                continue\n            if phase == n:\n                root = i\n                break\n        # Now process all nodes at the current phase level\n        queue = deque()\n        for i in range(1 << n):\n            if (i >> (n - phase)) & 1:\n                queue.append(i)\n        while queue:\n            m = queue.popleft()\n            c1 = tree[m]['left']\n            c2 = tree[m]['right']\n            if phase == n:\n                possible_winners[m] = set()\n                for x in possible_winners[c1]:\n                    for y in possible_winners[c2]:\n                        if (s[phase-1] == '0' and x < y) or (s[phase-1] == '1' and x > y):\n                            possible_winners[m].add(x)\n                for y in possible_winners[c2]:\n                    for x in possible_winners[c1]:\n                        if (s[phase-1] == '0' and y < x) or (s[phase-1] == '1' and y > x):\n                            possible_winners[m].add(y)\n                possible_winners[m] = sorted(possible_winners[m])\n            else:\n                set_c1 = possible_winners[c1]\n                set_c2 = possible_winners[c2]\n                winners_m = set()\n                for x in set_c1:\n                    for y in set_c2:\n                        if (s[phase-1] == '0' and x < y) or (s[phase-1] == '1' and x > y):\n                            winners_m.add(x)\n                for y in set_c2:\n                    for x in set_c1:\n                        if (s[phase-1] == '0' and y < x) or (s[phase-1] == '1' and y > x):\n                            winners_m.add(y)\n                possible_winners[m] = sorted(winners_m)\n            queue.append(m)\n    \n    root = tree[root]['root']  # Wait, no, perhaps I messed up the tree building\n    # After processing all phases, the root's possible winners are the champions\n    if root not in possible_winners:\n        root = 1 << n\n    if len(possible_winners[root]) == 0:\n        print()\n    else:\n        res = sorted(list(possible_winners[root]))\n        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution involves constructing a binary tree representation of the tournament, where each node represents a match. We then process each phase of the tournament, starting from the initial matches (leaves) and moving up to the final match (root).
