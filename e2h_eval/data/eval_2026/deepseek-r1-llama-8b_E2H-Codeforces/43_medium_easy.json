He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to check if a given string can be formed in a specific way. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem says that the string is built in three steps. First, A creates a string of some 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's. So after this step, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends some 'c's, but the number of 'c's must equal either the number of 'a's or 'b's (or both). \n\nSo, the string must satisfy certain conditions:\n\n1. The order of the characters is first all 'a's, then all 'b's, then all 'c's. No interleaving allowed.\n2. There's at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n3. The count of 'c's must be equal to the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's.\n\nHmm, so I need to check these conditions for the given string.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll need to parse the input string and calculate the counts of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's. Also, I need to check the order of the characters.\n\nSo step by step:\n\n1. Check that the string starts with some 'a's, followed by some 'b's, then some 'c's. Any deviation from this order means it's invalid.\n\nHow can I check the order? Well, I can iterate through the string and make sure that once we encounter a 'b', all subsequent characters are 'b's until the 'c's start. Similarly, once 'c's start, they continue till the end.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n- The string should consist of a non-empty 'a' prefix, followed by a non-empty 'b' suffix, followed by a non-empty 'c' suffix.\n\nWait, no. Wait, A gives a string of 'a's, then B appends some 'b's. So the initial string before C adds is a bunch of 'a's followed by a bunch of 'b's. Then C adds 'c's. So the overall structure is a series of 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's. So the string should have the form a+b+c+, but each part must be non-zero except maybe the c part? Wait no, because C appends some 'c's, which could be zero? Wait no, the note says that both A and B ensure that after their steps, there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. But when C appends, the count of 'c's is equal to 'a's or 'b's. So the 'c's count is at least 1, since 'a' and 'b' counts are at least 1.\n\nWait, the problem says: since A and B made sure that after their steps, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So after C appends, the string will have at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n\nSo the string must have all three letters, and their order must be a's first, then b's, then c's.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Check that the string is divided into three segments: a's, then b's, then c's. Each segment must be non-empty.\n\nSo, how to do this?\n\nWe can iterate through the string and find the positions where the transitions happen.\n\nFor example:\n\nStart with 'a's. Once a 'b' is found, the rest of the string must be 'b's until the next transition, which should be to 'c's. After that, everything must be 'c's.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Split the string into groups of consecutive same characters. For example, 'aaabccc' would split into ['a', 'b', 'c'].\n\nBut wait, the order must be exactly a's, then b's, then c's. So the groups must be in that order.\n\nSo, the groups list must be exactly of length 3, and the first group is 'a's, second 'b's, third 'c's.\n\nIf the groups are more than 3, or the order is wrong, then it's invalid.\n\nAdditionally, each group must have a length of at least 1.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- 'aabbaaccc' is invalid because the groups are a, b, a, c, which is not in order.\n\nAnother example: 'abc' is valid, groups are a, b, c.\n\nNow, once the groups are correct, we can compute the counts:\n\ncount_a = number of 'a's.\n\ncount_b = number of 'b's.\n\ncount_c = number of 'c's.\n\nThen, check whether count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\nFirst, process the string into groups.\n\nCheck that the groups are exactly three, in the order a, b, c.\n\nEach group must have at least one character.\n\nThen, count the a's, b's, c's.\n\nCheck if c_count is equal to a_count or b_count.\n\nIf all conditions are met, return YES, else NO.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nCase 1: All a's, then all b's, then all c's. For example, 'aaabbbccc'.\n\nGroups: [a, b, c], counts are 3,3,3. So c_count is equal to a_count and b_count. So YES.\n\nCase 2: 'abbbc'. Groups are a, b, c. a_count=1, b_count=3, c_count=1. c_count equals a_count, so YES.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, C appends 'c's equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's. So yes, that's acceptable.\n\nCase 3: 'aabbc' → groups a, b, c. a_count=2, b_count=2, c_count=1. c_count is not equal to a or b. So output is NO.\n\nCase 4: 'abc' → a=1, b=1, c=1. c_count equals both a and b. So YES.\n\nCase 5: 'ab' → No, because no c's. But according to the problem, the string must have at least one a, b, c. So any string without c is invalid.\n\nWait, the problem says that after C appends, the string must have at least one of each. So in the given string, it must have at least one a, one b, and one c.\n\nSo, if the string has zero a's, or zero b's, or zero c's, it's automatically invalid.\n\nWait, no. Because the string is created by A appending a's, B appending b's (so after B's step, it's at least one a and one b), then C appends c's (so after C, it's at least one c as well).\n\nSo the final string must have at least one a, b, and c.\n\nThus, in our code, we must first check that each of a_count, b_count, c_count is at least one.\n\nSo adding that as another condition.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Split the string into groups.\n\n2. Check that groups are exactly 3, in order a, b, c.\n\n3. Each group has at least one character.\n\n4. a_count, b_count, c_count >=1.\n\n5. c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count.\n\nIf all conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo now, how to implement this in Python.\n\nLet me think about the code.\n\nFirst, read the input string S.\n\nThen, process S into groups.\n\nTo process into groups, I can loop through each character and track when the current character changes.\n\nFor example:\n\ngroups = []\ncurrent_char = None\nfor char in S:\n    if char != current_char:\n        groups.append(char)\n        current_char = char\n\nWait, no, that would just get the unique characters. Because for 'aaaabbb', groups would be ['a', 'b'], which is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. That code would only record the first occurrence of each new character. So for 'aaabbbccc', groups would be ['a', 'b', 'c'], which is correct.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nTake S = 'aaabbbbcccaaa'.\n\nLooping through:\n\nchar is 'a' → different from current_char (None), add to groups, current_char becomes 'a'.\n\nNext 'a's are same, so nothing added.\n\nThen 'b's come: when the first 'b' is encountered, it's different from current_char 'a', so add 'b' to groups, current_char is now 'b'.\n\nSimilarly, when 'c's come, add 'c' to groups.\n\nSo in the code above, groups would correctly capture the sequence of distinct runs.\n\nWait, no. Because when a new character is found, the previous run is closed, and a new one starts.\n\nYes, that code will correctly build the groups as runs.\n\nWait, let me test with S='aabbaacc'.\n\nLoop:\n\ni=0, char='a' → current_char is None → add 'a' to groups, current_char = 'a'.\n\ni=1, char='a' → same as current_char, do nothing.\n\ni=2, char='b' → different → add 'b', current_char='b'.\n\ni=3, char='b' → same.\n\ni=4, char='a' → different → add 'a', current_char='a'.\n\ni=5, char='a' → same.\n\ni=6, char='c' → different → add 'c', current_char='c'.\n\ni=7, char='c' → same.\n\nSo groups are ['a','b','a','c'].\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo this code will correctly split the string into the runs.\n\nBut wait, what if the string is empty? According to the problem, the string is at least 1 character, so no problem.\n\nSo, the code for grouping is okay.\n\nOnce the groups are obtained, we need to check:\n\n- len(groups) == 3.\n\n- The first group is 'a's.\n\n- The second group is 'b's.\n\n- The third group is 'c's.\n\nSo, groups[0] must be 'a', groups[1] 'b', groups[2] 'c'.\n\nIf any of these is not true, the string is invalid.\n\nAlso, each group must have at least one character.\n\nSo, for each group in groups, len(group) >=1.\n\nOnce these are satisfied, we proceed to count the a's, b's, c's.\n\nWait, but since the groups are in order, the a_count is the length of the first group, b_count the second, c_count the third.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, a_count = len(groups[0])\n\nb_count = len(groups[1])\n\nc_count = len(groups[2])\n\nThen, check:\n\n- a_count >=1, b_count >=1, c_count >=1.\n\n- c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count.\n\nIf all these are true, output YES, else NO.\n\nNow, let's consider the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\nLet's analyze each case.\n\nFirst string: 'aaabccc'\n\nGroups: 'a', 'b', 'c' → valid.\n\na_count =3, b=1, c=3.\n\nc_count is 3, which equals a_count. So condition met → YES.\n\nSecond string: 'bbacc'\n\nWait, the string is 'bbacc' → groups would be 'b', 'a', 'c', 'c'? Wait, no.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe string is 'bbacc'.\n\nBreaking down:\n\n- 'b's first: 'bb' → group 'b'.\n\nThen comes 'a' → new group 'a'.\n\nThen 'c' → new group 'c'.\n\nSo groups are ['b','a','c'].\n\nWait, but the order is supposed to be a, b, c. So the first group is 'b', which is incorrect. So the entire string is invalid. So output NO.\n\nThird string: 'aabc' → groups are 'a', 'b', 'c' → correct.\n\na_count=1, b_count=1, c_count=2.\n\nc_count is 2, which equals neither a nor b. So condition fails. Wait, no, wait: c_count is 2, a_count is 1, b_count is 1. So 2 is not equal to either. So why does the sample output say YES?\n\nWait, wait, I think I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait the third sample input is 'aabc' → let's see.\n\nWait, 'aabc' is 'a','a','b','c' → groups are 'a', 'b', 'c' → correct.\n\na_count=2, b_count=1, c_count=1.\n\nc_count is 1. Is 1 equal to a_count (2) or b_count (1)? Yes, it's equal to b_count. So condition is satisfied. So output is YES.\n\nAh right, because the c_count is 1, which equals b_count of 1.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc'.\n\nGroups are ['a','b','c'] → correct.\n\na=1, b=1, c=1.\n\nc_count is 1, which equals a and b. So YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbc'.\n\nGroups: a, b, c → correct.\n\na=2, b=2, c=1.\n\nc_count is 1, which is less than a and b. So condition fails → output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → groups a, b, c.\n\na=1, b=3, c=1.\n\nc_count is 1, which equals a → condition met → YES.\n\nAnother case: 'aaabbb' → no c's. So groups are a, b. So len(groups) is 2 → invalid.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → groups a, b, c → correct.\n\nAnother case: 'abcb' → groups a, b, c, b → len(groups)=4 → invalid.\n\nSo, the code should correctly handle all these cases.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nThe steps for the code:\n\nRead the string S.\n\nProcess into groups.\n\nCheck len(groups) ==3.\n\nCheck groups[0] is 'a', groups[1] is 'b', groups[2] is 'c'.\n\nCheck len of each group >=1.\n\nCompute a_count, b_count, c_count.\n\nCheck a, b, c counts >=1.\n\nCheck c_count equals a_count or b_count.\n\nIf all true, output YES, else NO.\n\nImplementing this:\n\nNow, the code.\n\nRead S:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nProcess into groups:\n\ngroups = []\ncurrent = None\nfor c in s:\n    if c != current:\n        groups.append(c)\n        current = c\n\nThen, check len(groups) ==3.\n\nif len(groups)!=3:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if groups[0] != 'a' or groups[1]!='b' or groups[2]!='c':\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        # check each group has at least one\n        if len(groups[0]) <1 or len(groups[1])<1 or len(groups[2])<1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            a = len(groups[0])\n            b = len(groups[1])\n            c = len(groups[2])\n            if a <1 or b <1 or c <1:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                if c ==a or c ==b:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but the problem says that C appends some number of 'c's, which must be equal to a or b's count. So, the counts after C's step are the a, b, and c counts.\n\nWait, but in the code, the a_count is the original a's plus any others? No, because the groups are correct, the a's are only in the first group, b's only in the second, etc.\n\nSo the code correctly captures the a, b, c counts as the lengths of their respective groups.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTesting the code on the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 'aaabccc'\n\ngroups = ['a','b','c'].\n\nlen 3.\n\ngroups[0] is a, groups[1] b, groups[2] c → correct.\n\neach group has at least 1.\n\na=3, b=1, c=3.\n\nc=3 equals a → yes.\n\nOutput YES.\n\nSample 2: 'bbacc' → groups are ['b','a','c'].\n\ngroups[0] is 'b' → invalid → output NO.\n\nSample 3: 'aabc' → groups ['a','b','c'].\n\na=2, b=1, c=1.\n\nc=1 equals b → yes.\n\nOutput YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → groups correct, a=1, b=1, c=1 → c equals both → yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbc' → groups a, b, c. a=2, b=2, c=1. c not equal to a or b → output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'abbbc' → groups a, b, c. a=1, b=3, c=1 → c equals a → yes.\n\nWhat about a string like 'abba' → groups a, b, a → len 3, but third group is a → invalid.\n\nSo the code correctly handles that.\n\nNow, what about an empty string? According to the problem, the string is at least length 1, so no need to handle that.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaacc' → groups a, b, a, c → len 4 → invalid.\n\nSo code correctly outputs NO.\n\nAnother edge case: 'acb' → groups a, c, b → len 3, but order is wrong. So code returns NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'acbbc' → groups a, c, b, c → len 4 → invalid.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nI think this should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by a specific sequence of operations involving the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The string must follow the order of 'a's, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must equal either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Consecutive Characters**: Split the string into groups of consecutive same characters. This helps in verifying the order of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n2. **Check Group Structure**: Ensure that the string is divided into exactly three groups: 'a', 'b', and 'c' in that specific order.\n3. **Check Group Lengths**: Each group must contain at least one character.\n4. **Count Characters**: Calculate the counts of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's from their respective groups.\n5. **Validate Conditions**: Verify that the count of 'c's equals either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\ngroups = []\ncurrent = None\nfor c in s:\n    if c != current:\n        groups.append(c)\n        current = c\n\nif len(groups) != 3:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if groups[0] != 'a' or groups[1] != 'b' or groups[2] != 'c':\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        a_count = len(groups[0])\n        b_count = len(groups[1])\n        c_count = len(groups[2])\n        if a_count < 1 or b_count < 1 or c_count < 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and processed to identify consecutive groups of the same character.\n2. **Grouping Characters**: By iterating through the string, we create groups of consecutive 'a's, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's.\n3. **Validation of Groups**: We check if there are exactly three groups and if they are in the correct order ('a', 'b', 'c').\n4. **Counting Characters**: The lengths of the groups give us the counts of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n5. **Final Check**: We ensure that each count is at least 1 and that the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's. If all conditions are met, the string is valid; otherwise, it is not.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to determine the validity of the string as per the problem requirements.",
