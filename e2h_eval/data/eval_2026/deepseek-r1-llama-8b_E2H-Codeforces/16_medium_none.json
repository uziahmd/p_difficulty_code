Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a plane with n infinite line roads. Each road is given by the equation a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0. These roads divide the plane into blocks. The home and university are in some blocks. My goal is to find the minimum number of steps needed to move from home's block to the university's block. A step is moving between blocks that share a common border of non-zero length.\n\nHmm. So each step must cross a boundary that is a segment of a road. But wait, no. Because two blocks can be adjacent if they share a common border, which is a segment of a road. But for the step to be allowed, their shared border must have a non-zero length. So, for example, two blocks that touch at a single point (like an intersection) don't count as a step because there's no shared border segment.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding how many roads separate the home and university points. Because each time you cross a road, you change blocks. And the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\nWait, why? Because each such road forms a boundary that you must cross. So for each road, if the home and university are on opposite sides of it, then you need to cross it once. So the minimal steps are the count of such roads.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because each road that separates them adds one step. So the approach is: for each of the n roads, check if the home and university lie on opposite sides. If yes, count it. The total count is the answer.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read home coordinates (x1, y1).\n2. Read university coordinates (x2, y2).\n3. Read n roads.\n4. For each road, compute the value a*x + b*y + c for both home and university.\n5. If the signs are different, increment the count.\n6. After processing all roads, output the count.\n\nThis seems straightforward. Now, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nWhat if a road is not present? Then obviously, it doesn't contribute. So we only consider the roads given.\n\nAnother case: what if the home and university are already in the same block without crossing any roads? Then the count is zero.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, neither home nor university lie on any road, so each road will have the home and university on the same side or different sides.\n\nSo the algorithm is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nIn Python, reading the input correctly is important. The first two lines are home and university, which are given as strings, so I'll split them into integers.\n\nThen n is read, followed by n lines each with a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nFor each road, compute the value for home and university.\n\nIf the product of these values is negative, that means they are on opposite sides. So count +=1.\n\nSo the code would look something like this:\n\nRead x1, y1 from input.\nRead x2, y2 from input.\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor each of n roads:\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nThat's the core logic.\n\nTesting against the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n1 1\n-1 -1\n2\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nFor the first road: 0x +1y +0=0 → y=0. Home is (1,1): 1 >0. University (-1,-1): -1 <0. So they are on opposite sides. Count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1x +0y +0=0 → x=0. Home is 1>0, university -1<0. So count +=1. Total is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case in the sample input:\n\nThird line is 3 roads.\n\nRoad 1: 1x +0y +0=0 → x=0. Home is 1>0, university -1<0. So opposite → count +=1.\n\nRoad2: 0x +1y +0=0 → y=0. Home is 1>0, university -1<0. Opposite → count +=1.\n\nRoad3: 1x +1y -3=0 → at home: 1+1-3= -1. At university: -1-1-3 =-5. Both negative. So same side. No count.\n\nTotal count is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nNow, considering possible issues:\n\n- Data types: All variables can be handled as integers, since the computations are straightforward.\n\n- Overflow: But in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no issue.\n\n- Zero handling: The problem states that ai and bi are not both zero. So no division by zero issues.\n\nAnother thing: the home and university are guaranteed not to lie on any road, so val1 and val2 for each road cannot be zero. So we don't have to worry about equality.\n\nThus, the code should work for all cases.\n\nI think this is solid. Now, writing the code accordingly.\n\nWait, but in Python, sometimes when reading from standard input, especially if the input has leading or trailing spaces, the split() function might handle it, but in the problem statement, each line is properly formatted. So no issues.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nRead the first line, split into x1, y1.\n\nSecond line: x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nLoop n times:\n\nRead a, b, c.\n\nCompute val1 = a*x1 +b*y1 +c.\n\nval2 = a*x2 +b*y2 +c.\n\nif val1 * val2 <0: count +=1.\n\nPrint count.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n\nYes, that should do it.\n\nTesting again, for the sample input, the code outputs 2, which is correct.\n\nSo that's the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step allows moving between blocks that share a common border segment of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each road (line) in Crazy Town can be thought of as a boundary that separates the plane into two halves. If you and your university are on opposite sides of a road, you will need to cross that road exactly once. Therefore, the minimum number of steps required is equivalent to the number of roads that separate your home from your university.\n\n1. **Reading Input:** Read the coordinates of your home and university, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Evaluate Each Road:** For each road defined by the equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\), compute the value of the equation at both your home and university coordinates.\n3. **Check Separation:** If the values obtained for your home and university have opposite signs, it means they lie on opposite sides of the road, so you must cross this road.\n4. **Count Crossings:** Count how many such roads exist where your home and university are on opposite sides. This count gives the minimum number of steps needed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The code reads the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads and their coefficients.\n- **Evaluate Each Road:** For each road, the code computes the value of the line equation at the home and university points.\n- **Check Separation:** By checking if the product of these values is negative, the code determines if the points are on opposite sides of the road.\n- **Count Crossings:** The total count of such roads gives the minimum number of steps needed to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the required steps by leveraging the geometric properties of lines and their separation of points in the plane.",
