Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I'm given a string, and I have to find the length of its longest substring that appears at least twice. The occurrences can overlap. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about the examples they gave. For 'abcd', the output is 0 because all substrings are unique. For 'ababa', the output is 3 because the substring 'aba' appears starting at position 0 and 2. And for 'zzz', it's 2 because 'zz' appears twice.\n\nSo the task is to find the maximum possible length L such that there exists a substring of length L that appears more than once in the string.\n\nHow do I approach this?\n\nI remember that for substring problems, sliding window techniques are often used. But since I'm looking for the maximum possible length, maybe I should start checking from the largest possible L down to 1. Once I find an L where a substring of that length appears at least twice, I can return that L.\n\nBut wait, how do I efficiently check for each L? Because for each L, I need to look through all possible substrings of that length and see if any appears more than once.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate L from the maximum possible (length of string - 1) down to 1.\n2. For each L, collect all substrings of length L in a set or a dictionary to track their occurrences.\n3. If any substring is found more than once, return L as the answer.\n4. If none found for that L, move to L-1.\n\nWait, but for L=0, the output is 0 as per the first example. So we need to handle that case as well.\n\nBut wait, what's the maximum possible L? It's the length of the string minus one. Because, for example, in a string of length 3 like 'aaa', the maximum possible substring is length 2, which occurs twice.\n\nSo the algorithm could be something like this:\n\nLoop L from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n    create a dictionary to store all substrings of length L\n    for i from 0 to len(s) - L:\n        current_sub = s[i:i+L]\n        if current_sub is already in the dict:\n            return L\n        else:\n            add current_sub to the dict\nIf no L found (which would only happen when len(s) is 1), then return 0.\n\nWait, but that might not work for all cases. Let me test it on the sample input.\n\nSample 1: 'abcd' has length 4. So L starts at 3. Check all substrings of length 3: 'abc', 'bcd'. They are unique, so move to L=2. Substrings are 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' — all unique. Then L=1: 'a','b','c','d' — all unique. So return 0.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa' has length 5. Starting with L=4: substrings are 'abab', 'baba' — unique. Then L=3: 'aba' (i=0), then 'bab' (i=1), 'aba' (i=2). When i=2, current_sub is 'aba' which was already added at i=0. So return 3.\n\nSample 3: 'zzz' has length 3. L=2: substrings are 'zz' (i=0) and 'zz' (i=1). So when i=1, 'zz' is already in the dict, so return 2.\n\nYes, that seems to work.\n\nBut wait, what about a case where multiple substrings of the same length occur more than once, but the first occurrence is not the earliest. Like 'ababab'. For L=3, 'aba' occurs at positions 0, 2, 4. So when processing i=0, 'aba' is added. At i=2, it's found again, so return 3.\n\nAnother example: 'abcabc' — the maximum L is 3, since 'abc' occurs twice.\n\nNow, let's think about the efficiency. Since the string can be up to 100 characters, even in the worst case where we check L from 99 down to 1, each time checking all possible substrings, it's manageable. Because for each L, the number of substrings is len(s) - L + 1. For L=99, it's 2 substrings. For L=50, it's 51, etc. So overall, the total operations are O(n^2), which for n=100 is acceptable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Iterate L from len(s)-1 down to 1.\n- For each L, iterate through all possible starting indices i, extract the substring s[i:i+L].\n-",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves checking each possible substring length starting from the maximum possible down to 1. For each length, we examine all possible substrings of that length. If any substring is found to repeat, we return the current length as the result. If no such substring is found for a given length, we decrement the length and check again until we find a valid substring or exhaust all possibilities.\n\n1. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: Start from the maximum possible substring length (which is the length of the string minus one) and move downwards to 1.\n2. **Check Substrings**: For each length, generate all possible substrings and track their occurrences using a dictionary.\n3. **Return Result**: As soon as a repeating substring is found, return its length. If no repeating substring is found for any length, return 0.\n\nThis method ensures that we efficiently find the longest repeating substring by leveraging a dictionary to track occurrences, which allows for quick lookups and ensures we stop early if a solution is found.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nmax_len = n - 1 if n > 1 else 0\n\nfor L in range(max_len, 0, -1):\n    substr_dict = {}\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in substr_dict:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        substr_dict[substr] = True\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: The input string is read and its length is determined.\n- **Loop Through Lengths**: Starting from the maximum possible substring length, we iterate downwards.\n- **Substring Tracking**: For each length, we use a dictionary to store each substring and check for duplicates.\n- **Early Termination**: As soon as a duplicate substring is found, we print the length and exit the program.\n- **Edge Cases**: If no repeating substring is found, the function prints 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest repeating substring with minimal computational overhead, making it suitable for strings up to the given constraint of 100 characters.",
