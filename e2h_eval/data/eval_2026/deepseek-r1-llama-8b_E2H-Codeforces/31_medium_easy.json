            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Vanya and Cards\n\nVanya loves playing. He even has a special set of cards to play with. Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Vanya is trying to balance the sum of his found cards to zero. The problem gives me the number of found cards (n) and the maximum absolute value x on any card. Also, it's given that all the found cards have numbers within -x to x. My task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find to make the total sum zero.\n\nHmm, let's think about this. The initial sum of the found cards can be calculated, and then we need to determine how many more cards (with values between -x and x) are needed so that when added to this sum, the total becomes zero.\n\nWait, but wait: the problem says that Natasha hid all his cards, but he found some. So the found cards' sum is S. He wants the total sum (including the ones he hasn't found yet) to be zero. But since Natasha took all the other cards, maybe the initial found cards are the only ones he has, and he needs to find more to add to make the sum zero.\n\nWait no, the problem statement says that Vanya found n cards, and he wants the sum of all found cards to be zero. But initially, he had infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x. So perhaps the found cards are a subset of those, and he needs to find some missing ones such that the sum of all found (including the new ones) is zero.\n\nWait, the exact problem statement says: \"the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero.\" So after finding some more cards, the sum should be zero.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the found cards.\n2. The required additional sum is (-current_sum). So the sum of the new cards must be equal to (-current_sum).\n3. Each new card can contribute at most x (in absolute value), so the minimal number of cards needed is determined by the required sum divided by x, rounded up.\n\nBut wait, because each new card can contribute up to x (or as low as -x), the minimal number is the ceiling of |required_sum| / x. Because each card can add up to x towards the target.\n\nLet's take an example. In the first sample input:\n\n3 2\n-1 1 2\n\nThe sum is (-1 +1 +2)=2. So required is -2. The minimal number of cards is 1, since -2 is within [-2, 2], so one card suffices.\n\nIn the second sample:\n\n2 3\n-2 -2\n\nSum is -4. Required is 4. Each new card can contribute up to 3. So 4/3 is 1.333, so we need 2 cards (since 3*1=3 <4, 3*2=6 >=4).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Calculate the sum of the found cards.\n- The target is to reach zero, so the required sum from the new cards is (-sum_found).\n- Compute the absolute value of this required sum.\n- The minimal number of cards is the smallest integer k such that k * x >= required_sum_abs.\n- So, k = ceil(required_sum_abs / x).\n\nWait, but what if the required_sum_abs is zero? Then no additional cards are needed.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCompute current_sum = sum of the found cards.\n\nIf current_sum is zero, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nrequired = abs(current_sum)\nk = (required + x -1) // x  # This is equivalent to ceiling division.\n\nOutput k.\n\nWait, but in code, how do I handle cases where required is exactly divisible by x?\n\nFor example, if required is 6 and x is 3, then 6/3=2, so k is 2.\n\nYes, the formula (required + x -1) // x works for both cases.\n\nSo now, the plan is:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of n integers.\n\nCompute current_sum.\n\nCompute required = abs(current_sum)\n\nIf required is zero: output 0.\n\nElse: compute k = (required + x -1) // x.\n\nPrint k.\n\nWait, but what about if required is not possible to achieve with the available x per card? Oh, but the problem says that Natasha hid all the other cards, but the found cards are the ones Vanya has. So he can find any of the other cards, including those that may have the same numbers as the found ones.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem states that the found cards are a subset of the original set, which was all integers from -x to x. So to get the required sum, he can pick any of those numbers, even duplicates. So for example, if the required sum is 5 and x is 2, each new card can contribute up to 2, so he needs 3 cards (2+2+1, but wait, no, because each card can be 2, so 3*2=6 >=5, so 3 cards. Or 5//2 is 2.5, so ceil is 3.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, let's test the examples:\n\nFirst sample:\n\nsum is 2, required is 2. x is 2.\n\nk = 2/2=1, so 1 card.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nsum is -4, required is 4. x is 3.\n\n4/3 is 1.333, so ceil to 2.\n\nAnother test case: if sum is 0, output 0.\n\nWhat if sum is 5, x is 2: 5/2=2.5, so 3 cards.\n\nWhat if sum is 6, x is 3: 6/3=2, so 2 cards.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of numbers.\n\nCompute s = sum of the list.\n\nrequired = abs(s)\n\nif required ==0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    k = (required + x -1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nSo, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, looking at the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2\n\nsum is (-1+1+2)=2. required is 2. 2/2=1 → output 1.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2\n\nsum is -4. required is 4. 4/3 is 1.333 → ceil to 2.\n\nSo output is 2.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the output is '1', which is correct.\n\nIn the second sample, the output is '2'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code is:\n\nRead n and x from the first line.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute sum, then required, etc.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\nrequired = abs(s)\nif required ==0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    k = (required + x -1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nThat's all.\n\nTesting another edge case: what if sum is 0?\n\nn=1, x=5, cards [0]. sum is 0. So output 0.\n\nAnother case: sum is 10, x is 3. 10/3 is 3.333 → 4 cards.\n\nWait, 3*3=9 <10 → need 4 cards.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his found cards equals zero. Each card can have a value between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Sum of Found Cards**: Compute the sum of the values on the cards that Vanya has already found.\n2. **Determine the Required Sum**: The target is to make the total sum of all found cards (including the new ones) equal to zero. Therefore, the sum of the additional cards needed should be the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Compute Minimum Number of Cards**: Each additional card can contribute up to x towards the required sum. The minimum number of cards needed is the smallest integer k such that k * x is at least the absolute value of the required sum. This can be efficiently computed using ceiling division.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent_sum = sum(cards)\nrequired = abs(current_sum)\nif required == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    min_cards = (required + x - 1) // x\n    print(min_cards)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line contains two integers, n (number of found cards) and x (maximum absolute value on any card). The second line contains the values of the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the found cards.\n3. **Required Sum**: Calculate the absolute value of the current sum, which tells us how much more we need to reach zero.\n4. **Ceiling Division**: To find the minimum number of cards needed, we use ceiling division. This is achieved by the formula `(required + x - 1) // x`, which effectively rounds up the division result to the nearest integer.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum number of additional cards required, handling all edge cases correctly.",
