There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tennis tournament. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe tournament is knockout, meaning every game eliminates one player. The grid arrangement is not fixed yet, but there's a rule: two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. Also, both must have won all their previous games to reach that point.\n\nThe goal is to find the maximum number of games the winner can participate in. So, I need to model how the winner can progress through the tournament, ensuring that each game adheres to the given rule.\n\nLet's think about small examples first.\n\nFor n=2: Only one game, so the answer is 1.\nFor n=3: The winner plays two games. How? Maybe the winner beats two players in consecutive games. Like, in the first round, he plays someone, then in the next round, another. But wait, how do the rounds work here? Since it's a knockout, each win brings you to the next round. So for 3 players, the structure is such that the winner plays two games.\n\nAnother example: n=4. The maximum is 2 games. Because after two wins, the winner can't play more than two games without violating the rule. Wait, why not three? Hmm, maybe because the structure doesn't allow it. Let me see. Suppose the winner plays against three opponents. Each opponent must have a number of games differing by at most one from the winner's current count.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is that the winner has to form a path through the tournament tree, where each step from one game to the next must satisfy the condition that the number of games each participant has played before that match is either the same or differs by one.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the longest possible path for the winner, considering that each new match must connect to a subtree where the players have played either the same number of games or one less.\n\nThis feels similar to some kind of graph traversal, but perhaps there's a mathematical pattern here.\n\nLet me consider the possible maximum number of games a winner can play as a function of n. Let's denote f(n) as the maximum number of games.\n\nLooking at the sample inputs:\n\nn=2 → f(n)=1\nn=3 → f(n)=2\nn=4 → f(n)=2\nn=10 → f(n)=4\n\nWait, let's see. For n=10, the output is 4. So, the winner can play four games. How?\n\nPerhaps the structure is like a binary tree, where each node represents a game. The winner starts at the root and goes down, each time adding branches where possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum number of games is related to the Fibonacci sequence. Because each step depends on the sum of certain previous steps.\n\nWait, let me think recursively. Suppose the winner has played k games. Then, in the last game, they must have beaten someone who has played either k-1 or k games.\n\nWait no, the rule is that the two players' previous game counts differ by at most one. So when they meet in the next game, one could have played k-1 and the other k.\n\nBut for the winner, to maximize the number of games, each subsequent game must be against someone who has played either one less or the same number of games.\n\nHmm, maybe we can model this as a dynamic programming problem. Let's define dp[i] as the maximum number of games a player can have played if they are part of a subset of i players.\n\nWait, but that might be too vague. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model it as the maximum number of games possible in a tournament with m players, given that the winner can have a certain number of games.\n\nAlternatively, think about the tournament as a series of subtrees. Each game the winner plays must come from a subtree where the participants have played either the same number of games or one less.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum number of games is determined by the largest possible Fibonacci-like sequence that fits into n.\n\nFor example, let's see:\n\nThe maximum number of games is the largest k where the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to n.\n\nWait, let's test this idea.\n\nFor n=2: The Fibonacci sequence is 1,1,2,3,5,...\n\nIf k=1, then F(3)=2 ≤2. So yes.\n\nn=3: F(4)=3 ≤3. So k=2? Because F(3)=2, F(4)=3. So yes, the maximum is 2.\n\nn=4: F(5)=5>4. So the largest k where F(k+2) <=4 is k=2, because F(4)=3<=4, but",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given that two players can only face each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the problem can be modeled using a dynamic programming approach. We need to find the longest possible path for the winner in a binary tree structure where each node represents a game. The maximum number of games the winner can play corresponds to the depth of this tree.\n\nWe can use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of games a player can play with `i` players remaining. The recurrence relation is based on the Fibonacci sequence because each subsequent game depends on the sum of the previous two games, ensuring the rule is satisfied.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nif n == 1:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[2] = 1\n    for i in range(3, n + 1):\n        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]\n    print(dp[n])\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the maximum number of games for `i` players.\n2. **Base Case**: For `n = 2`, the winner can only play 1 game.\n3. **Recurrence Relation**: For each subsequent number of players `i`, the maximum number of games the winner can play is the sum of the maximum games for `i-1` and `i-2` players. This is because each game the winner plays must be against someone who has either played the same number of games or one less, forming a Fibonacci-like progression.\n4. **Result**: The value `dp[n]` gives the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result in O(n) time and O(n) space, making it suitable for the given constraints.",
