There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a tennis tournament. The tournament is knockout, meaning each loss gets you out. And the rule is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one.\n\nHmm, let's think about how the tournament works. The winner has to win every game they play, obviously. But the way the grid is structured affects how many games they can play because each new opponent must have a game count that's either equal or one less than the winner's current count.\n\nWait, so for example, if the winner has played k games, their next opponent could have played k-1 or k games. But since the opponent also needs to reach the final, their path to there must satisfy the same condition.\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be modeled with some kind of mathematical approach or maybe dynamic programming. Let's try to break it down.\n\nLet me consider small values of n and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nFor n=2: There's only one game. So the winner plays 1 game.\n\nn=3: The winner plays two games. How? They first play someone (game 1), then play another. Because after the first game, the opponent has 1 game as well, so the next can be someone else who has 0 or 1. Since it's a knockout, the next opponent must have exactly 1 game, which means the winner's second game is against someone who just won their first game.\n\nSo for n=3, max games is 2.\n\nn=4: Let's see. If the winner plays two games, but wait, what about the structure? Maybe arrange it such that the winner plays two games. Or perhaps more?\n\nWait, the sample input says when n=10, the output is 4. So the winner can play 4 games.\n\nHow? Let me think about the progression:\n\nThe winner starts with 0 games. To play their first game, they need an opponent with 0 or 1 game. But initially, everyone has 0. So they play someone, now both have 1 game.\n\nNext, to play a second game, the opponent must have 0 or 1. So the winner can play again, but wait, the opponent might not have enough people.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the structure is built in such a way that the winner can keep playing until certain conditions are met.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum number of games is determined by finding the largest possible Fibonacci-like sequence where each step adds a number that's either the previous or previous plus one.\n\nBecause each game the winner plays requires that the opponent has either the same number of games or one less. So the number of players that can be arranged in such a way is similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nLet's model this. Suppose the maximum number of games the winner can play is f(k). Then, the number of players required for the winner to play k games is the sum of the two preceding terms. For example:\n\nf(1) = 1 player (just the winner)\nf(2) = 2 players (winner plays one game)\nf(3) = 3 players (winner plays two games)\nWait, no, that's not adding up correctly. Let's think differently.\n\nEach time the winner plays a game, the opponent comes from a group where their number of games is either one less or equal.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the minimum number of players needed for the winner to have m games. Let's denote m as the maximum games, and find the smallest n such that the sum of the required players equals or exceeds the given n.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So for each m, compute the minimal number of players required, and find the largest m where this minimal number is ≤ n.\n\nSo, let's define dp[m] as the minimal number of players required for the winner to have m games. Then, for each m, we can compute dp[m], and find the maximum m where dp[m] ≤ n.\n\nHow to compute dp[m]?\n\nLet me think recursively. To have m games, the winner must have played m games. Each game except the first must come from a pool where the opponent has either m-1 or m games.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model it as follows: the number of players needed for the winner to have m games is equal to the sum of the players needed for m-1 games (opponent with m-1 games) plus those for m-2 games (opponent with m-2 games), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: the winner's first game requires one opponent. Then, for each subsequent game, the opponent must have a number of games that is at most one less than the winner's current count.\n\nSo, for the second game, the opponent could have 1 or 0 games. Wait, but after the first game, the opponent has 1 game. So for the next game, the winner has 1 game, and the opponent must have 0 or 1.\n\nBut the opponent can't have played any other games unless they've been part of a previous match. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, maybe the minimal number of players for m games is the (m+2)th Fibonacci number. Because each step depends on the sum of two previous steps.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis.\n\nFor m=1: The winner plays 1 game. Opponent has 0. So total players is 2. So minimal players is 2.\n\nFor m=2: The winner plays 2 games. The first game uses 1 opponent (total 2 players). The second game's opponent must have 1 or 0 games. But in the case of 1 game, the opponent is someone who has won once. So, in this case, the opponent for the second game must have played once, meaning they had to have beaten someone else. So for m=2, the minimal players would be 3: winner, opponent A (who has 1 game), and opponent B (who was beaten by A). So total players: 3.\n\nWait, but according to the sample input for n=3, the answer is 2. So for m=2, the minimal players is 3, which is exactly n=3. So yes, that fits.\n\nWait, but according to the sample, for n=4, the output is 2. So the maximum m is 2. What's the minimal players for m=2? It's 3. But n=4 is larger than 3, so why isn't m=3 possible?\n\nAh, because for m=3, the minimal number of players required is 5. Let's see: m=3.\n\nTo have 3 games, the winner plays 3 times.\n\nGame 1: opponent has 0 games. So one player used.\n\nGame 2: opponent must have 1 or 0 games. So the opponent for game 2 could be someone who has played once, which requires another player (so total 3 players so far: winner, A, B).\n\nBut wait, in game 2, the winner is now at 1 game. For game 3, the opponent must have 1 or 2 games. Wait, no: the condition is that the opponent's game count differs by at most one from the winner's current game count before the game. So before game 3, the winner has 2 games (after two wins). So the opponent can have 1 or 2 games.\n\nBut for the third game, the opponent must have at least 2 games. How can that happen?\n\nWait, the opponent in game 3 must have played 2 games. So they must have won two matches. So how is that possible?\n\nThey must have beaten two opponents in their own bracket. So, for the opponent in game 3, they must have beaten two others, meaning that those two others have lost, and the opponent has 2 games.\n\nThus, the minimal players for m=3 is 5: winner, A, B, C, D. Let me see:\n\n- Game 1: winner vs A. A has 1, winner has 1.\n- Game 2: winner vs B (B has 0). Now winner has 2, B has 1.\n- Game 3: winner vs C. C must have 1 or 2 games. But how did C get 2? Because C must have beaten two others. So in the setup, C must have played two games before facing the winner.\n\nSo, to have C with 2 games, we need C to have beaten two players, say D and E. But wait, that would require 5 players (D and E for C's path). So the total players for m=3 is 5.\n\nSo, for m=3, minimal players is 5.\n\nBut in the sample input for n=4, the output is 2. So even though n=4 is larger than 3, the minimal for m=3 is 5, which is larger than 4. Thus, m cannot be 3 for n=4.\n\nSo, the approach is to find the largest m where the minimal number of players required for m games is ≤n.\n\nNow, the task is to model dp[m], the minimal number of players required for m games.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nm=1 → 2 players\nm=2 → 3 players\nm=3 →5 players\nm=4 → 8 players?\nWait, let's compute dp[4].\n\nFor m=4, the winner plays 4 games.\n\nThe fourth game's opponent must have 3 or 4 games. But since the opponent hasn't played yet, they must have 3 games.\n\nSo, to have an opponent with 3 games, that opponent must have beaten 3 others. So the opponent's path requires 3 games, which requires 4 players (since m=3 needs 5 players, but wait no—this seems confusing).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of players for m games is the sum of the minimal players for m-1 and m-2, similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\ndp[1] = 2\n\ndp[2] = 3\n\ndp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] = 3 + 2 = 5\n\ndp[4] = dp[3] + dp[2] =5+3=8\n\ndp[5] = dp[4] + dp[3} =8+5=13\n\nYes, this seems to fit.\n\nSo, the minimal number of players required for m games is the (m+1)th Fibonacci number, but starting from dp[1]=2, dp[2]=3.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFibonacci sequence starting from 2,3,5,8,13,...\n\nWhich is the Fibonacci numbers shifted. So, the Fibonacci sequence is usually defined as F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, etc. So our dp[m] = F(m+2), where F is the standard Fibonacci sequence.\n\nWait:\n\nFor m=1: dp[1]=2=F(3)=2.\n\nm=2: dp[2]=3=F(4)=3.\n\nm=3: dp[3}=5=F(5)=5.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, dp[m] = Fib(m+2), where Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, etc.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the largest m such that Fib(m+2) ≤n.\n\nOnce we find that m, that's the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the Fibonacci sequence up to m+2 where Fib(m+2) <=1018.\n\n2. For the given n, find the largest m where Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\n3. Output m.\n\nNow, the question is, how do I compute Fib(m+2) efficiently?\n\nSince n can be up to 1018, the maximum possible m is limited. Let's compute the Fib numbers until Fib(k) exceeds 1018.\n\nLet's compute Fib numbers:\n\nFib(1) =1\n\nFib(2)=1\n\nFib(3)=2\n\nFib(4)=3\n\nFib(5)=5\n\nFib(6)=8\n\nFib(7)=13\n\nFib(8)=21\n\nFib(9)=34\n\nFib(10)=55\n\nFib(11)=89\n\nFib(12)=144\n\nFib(13)=233\n\nFib(14)=377\n\nFib(15)=610\n\nFib(16)=987\n\nFib(17)=1597\n\nSo, Fib(17)=1597>1018.\n\nSo, for n=1018, the maximum m is 15, since Fib(17) is 1597>1018, so the largest k is 16, which corresponds to m=14.\n\nWait, because dp[m] = Fib(m+2). So for m=14, dp[14]=Fib(16)=987<=1018.\n\nWait, Fib(16)=987, which is <=1018.\n\nWhat about m=15: dp[15]=Fib(17)=1597>1018.\n\nSo, for n=1018, m is 14.\n\nSo, the code should generate all Fib numbers up to Fib(k) where Fib(k) <=1018, then for a given n, find the maximum m where Fib(m+2)<=n.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\n- Generate a list of Fib numbers, starting from Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, etc., up to the largest Fib(k) <=1018.\n\n- For each input n, find the largest m where Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nSo, the code will precompute all Fib numbers up to 1018, then for each test case, perform a binary search to find the maximum m.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nIn Python:\n\nWe can generate the Fib sequence up to the point where Fib exceeds 1018.\n\nThen, for each n in the input, find the largest m where Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nSo, let's write code.\n\nFirst, generate the Fib list.\n\nfib_list = [2, 3]\n\nnext_fib = 5\n\nwhile next_fib <= 1018:\n\n    fib_list.append(next_fib)\n\n    next_fib = fib_list[-1] + fib_list[-2]\n\nWait, no. Because Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, etc.\n\nWait, no, earlier I thought dp[m] = Fib(m+2). So, for m=1, dp[1]=2=Fib(3). m=2:3=Fib(4). So, the Fib numbers start from 2.\n\nSo, the Fib sequence in our context is starting from Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, etc.\n\nSo, the initial fib_list should be [2,3,5,8,...].\n\nSo, let's initialize the fib_list as [2,3], then each next term is sum of last two.\n\nWait, but 2+3=5, yes.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nfib_list = [2, 3]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_val = fib_list[-1] + fib_list[-2]\n\n    if next_val > 1018:\n\n        break\n\n    fib_list.append(next_val)\n\nSo, for n=1018, the largest Fib is 987 (Fib(16)), which is 987.\n\nSo, for each n, we need to find the maximum m where Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nBut how is Fib related to m?\n\nFor example, Fib(3)=2 → m=1.\n\nFib(4)=3 → m=2.\n\nFib(5)=5 → m=3.\n\nFib(6)=8 → m=4.\n\nSo, the index in fib_list is i. So, m = i-2.\n\nBecause fib_list[i] is Fib(i+2), since Fib(3) is at index 0.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nfib_list is [2,3,5,8,13,...]\n\nfib_list[0] =2 → Fib(3)\n\nfib_list[1]=3 → Fib(4)\n\nfib_list[2]=5 → Fib(5)\n\nSo, for a value x = fib_list[k], x is Fib(k+2).\n\nSo, to find m, where x = Fib(m+2) <=n, the maximum m is k-2, where k is the largest index such that fib_list[k] <=n.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nIf x=2 (fib_list[0]), m=0 → Fib(3) is 2, m=1.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, x = Fib(m+2) → m+2 = k+2? No.\n\nWait, fib_list[k] is Fib(k+2).\n\nSo, if fib_list[k] = Fib(m+2) → m+2 = k+2 → m=k.\n\nWait, no. Because, for k=0, fib_list[0]=2=Fib(3)=2, which is Fib(3). So m+2=3 → m=1.\n\nSimilarly, for k=1, fib_list[1]=3=Fib(4) → m+2=4 → m=2.\n\nSo, in general, for a given x in fib_list[k], m =k.\n\nBecause x= Fib(k+2) → m+2 =k+2 → m=k.\n\nSo, the maximum m is the largest k where fib_list[k] <=n.\n\nWait, no. Because for each x in fib_list, m is k.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nn=5.\n\nfib_list[0]=2 ≤5 → m=0.\n\nfib_list[1]=3 ≤5 → m=1.\n\nfib_list[2]=5 ≤5 → m=2.\n\nfib_list[3]=8>5 → stop.\n\nSo, the maximum m is 2.\n\nWhich is correct because for n=5, the maximum games is 3.\n\nWait, wait, no.\n\nWait, for m=2, dp[m] is 3. So for n=5, which is larger than 3, m can be 2.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier approach, for n=5, the maximal m is 3, because dp[3]=5<=5.\n\nYes, because fib_list[2]=5 is <=5, so m=2+1=3? Or wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mapping.\n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\nfib_list[k] = Fib(k+2)\n\nWe want to find the largest m where Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nSo, m+2 can be at most log(n).\n\nSo, for a given x in fib_list, x=Fib(k+2) implies that m+2=k+2 → m=k.\n\nWait, no. Because Fib(k+2) is x, so m+2 =k+2 → m=k.\n\nSo, for each x in fib_list, the corresponding m is k.\n\nSo, the maximum m is the largest k where fib_list[k] <=n.\n\nThus, for n=5, the largest x in fib_list is 5, which is Fib(5). So k=2, m=2.\n\nBut wait, that would imply that the maximum m is 2. But earlier for n=5, the maximum m is 3.\n\nHmm, perhaps I messed up the initial mapping.\n\nWait, maybe my earlier approach was wrong. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, for m=3, dp[m]=5. So for n=5, the maximum m is 3.\n\nBut according to the fib_list, fib_list[2] is 5, which is m=2.\n\nSo that suggests that the mapping is incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps I have the indexes wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the fib_list is being considered as Fib(3), Fib(4), Fib(5), etc., but the way m relates to the index is different.\n\nLet me re-express:\n\nfib_list[0] = 2 → Fib(3)\n\nfib_list[1] =3 → Fib(4)\n\nfib_list[2] =5 → Fib(5)\n\nfib_list[3]=8 → Fib(6)\n\nSo, the index in the list is k, and the Fib number is Fib(k+2).\n\nThus, for a given x in fib_list[k], x=Fib(k+2).\n\nSo, to find the largest m where Fib(m+2) <=n, we can find the largest k where Fib(k+2) <=n, and then m =k.\n\nWait, no.\n\nBecause m+2 =k+2 → m=k.\n\nSo, for x=5, k=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5.\n\nWait, no, Fib(5) is 5, which is at index 2.\n\nSo, for x=5, m=2.\n\nBut for m=2, the maximum games is 2.\n\nBut earlier, for n=5, the maximum m is 3.\n\nWait, this suggests that the approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I have a misunderstanding of the dp[m]. Let me reevaluate.\n\nWait, the minimal number of players required for m games is Fib(m+2).\n\nSo, for m=1: 2 players.\n\nm=2:3.\n\nm=3:5.\n\nm=4:8.\n\nSo, for n=5, the maximum m is 3, because dp[3]=5<=5.\n\nBut according to the fib_list, the largest Fib(k) <=5 is 5, which is Fib(5). So k=2 (since fib_list[2]=5 is Fib(5)). So m=2.\n\nThat's a contradiction.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of players for m games is Fib(m+1).\n\nWait, let me recalculate.\n\nFor m=1: players needed 2=Fib(3).\n\nm=2:3=Fib(4).\n\nm=3:5=Fib(5).\n\nYes, that holds.\n\nSo, the minimal players for m games is Fib(m+2).\n\nSo, for m=3, players needed is 5.\n\nSo, for n=5, m=3 is allowed.\n\nThus, the earlier approach is correct, but perhaps I messed up the way to find m from the fib_list.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to find the largest m where Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nSo, for n=5, Fib(5)=5<=5, so m=3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the way to compute m is to find the largest m where Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nSo, in the code, for each n, we need to find the maximum m such that Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nSo, the code should generate the Fib sequence as Fib(3), Fib(4), Fib(5), ..., up to Fib(k) where Fib(k) <=1018.\n\nThen, for each n, find the largest m where Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nSo, how to find m for a given n.\n\nWe can precompute the Fib numbers, and for a given n, find the maximum m by binary searching the Fib list.\n\nBut wait, the Fib list is ordered, so for each n, the maximum m is the largest index k such that Fib(k) <=n, and then m =k-2.\n\nBecause Fib(k) is Fib(m+2) → m =k-2.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nIf Fib(k) is 2, which is Fib(3) → m=1.\n\nSo, k=3, m=1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: Fib(k)=5 → m=3.\n\nSo, k=5 → m=3.\n\nThus, for a given Fib(k) <=n, the maximum m is k-2.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n1. Precompute all Fib(k) where Fib(k) is >=2, up to 1018.\n\n2. For each n, find the largest k in the Fib list such that Fib(k) <=n.\n\n3. The maximum m is k-2.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nn=2: Fib(k)=2 is at k=3. So m=3-2=1.\n\nn=3: Fib(k)=3 is at k=4. m=4-2=2.\n\nn=5: Fib(k)=5 is at k=5. m=5-2=3.\n\nn=8: Fib(k)=8 is at k=6. m=6-2=4.\n\nn=10: The Fib numbers are 2,3,5,8,13.\n\nSo, the largest Fib(k)<=10 is 8, which is at k=6. So m=6-2=4. Which matches the sample input.\n\nThus, the code should:\n\n- Generate Fib(k) up to the maximum possible, which is Fib(k) <=1018.\n\n- For a given n, find the largest Fib(k) <=n.\n\n- m =k-2.\n\nThus, in the code:\n\nGenerate Fib_list as follows:\n\nfib_list = []\na, b = 2, 3\nfib_list.append(a)\nfib_list.append(b)\nwhile True:\n    c = a + b\n    if c > 1018:\n        break\n    fib_list.append(c)\n    a, b = b, c\n\nWait, no. Because starting with a=2, b=3, then c=5, then 8, etc.\n\nBut in the code, the loop appends c, but a and b are updated.\n\nSo, the Fib_list will contain 2,3,5,8,13, etc.\n\nNow, for a given n, we need to find the largest Fib(k) in fib_list that is <=n.\n\nOnce found, k is the index, and m =k-2.\n\nWait, but the Fib_list may not include Fib(k) directly. So, for example, for n=4, the Fib_list is [2,3,5, ...], and 3<=4<5. So the largest Fib(k) <=4 is 3, which is at index 1. So m=1-2= -1? That can't be right.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for n=4:\n\nThe Fib_list is [2,3,5,8,...]. So for n=4, the largest Fib(k) <=4 is 3, which is at index 1.\n\nThus, m=1-2= -1. Which is impossible.\n\nBut earlier analysis for n=4, the maximum m is 2.\n\nWait, this suggests a flaw in the approach.\n\nWait, what's the correct way for n=4.\n\nThe maximum m is 2 because dp[2]=3<=4. So for n=4, can we have m=2?\n\nYes.\n\nBut according to the code, for Fib(k)=3 (index 1), m=1-2= -1, which is wrong.\n\nAh! So the approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the mapping wrong.\n\nEarlier, I thought that m =k-2. But in the case of n=4, the correct m is 2, but the code gives m=1-2=-1.\n\nThus, the mapping is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps m is the position in the Fib list minus 1.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nWhen Fib(k) is 2, which is m=1.\n\nSo, k=0, m=1.\n\nWhen Fib(k)=3, m=2.\n\nk=1, m=2.\n\nFib(k)=5, m=3.\n\nk=2, m=3.\n\nSo, m =k.\n\nThus, for each Fib(k), m=k.\n\nSo, for n=4, the largest Fib(k) <=4 is 3, which is at k=1. So m=1.\n\nBut earlier, for n=4, the maximum m is 2.\n\nThis is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial understanding of dp[m] is incorrect.\n\nWait, for m=2, dp[m] is 3 players.\n\nFor n=4, which is larger than 3, can the winner play more than 2 games?\n\nYes, perhaps.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nn=4.\n\nIs there a way to arrange the tournament so that the winner plays 3 games?\n\nWell, to play 3 games, the minimal number of players required is 5 (for m=3, dp[3}=5). But n=4<5, so it's impossible.\n\nThus, for n=4, m can be 2.\n\nSo the maximum is 2.\n\nBut according to the code, when Fib(k)=3 (k=1), m=1. Which is not correct.\n\nThus, the initial approach is flawed.\n\nHmm, perhaps the Fib numbers represent the maximum number of games, not the minimal players.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dp[m] is the maximum number of players that can be handled, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is to find the maximum m where Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nWait, for m=2, Fib(4)=3<=4.\n\nSo m=2 is allowed.\n\nThus, the maximum m is 2.\n\nSo, for n=4, the maximum is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, how to find m=2 when Fib(k)=3 is k=1.\n\nBecause for k=1, m=1, which is incorrect.\n\nThus, perhaps the way to compute m is not directly k, but something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the code needs to find the largest k where Fib(k) <=n, and then m is the number of games where Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nWait, perhaps m is the maximum value such that Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nSo, for a given Fib(k), if Fib(k) <=n, then m+2 can be k, so m=k-2.\n\nWait, for Fib(k)=2, m=1.\n\nFor Fib(k)=3, m=2.\n\nFor Fib(k)=5, m=3.\n\nFor Fib(k)=8, m=4.\n\nThus, for n=4, the largest Fib(k) is 3, so m=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code should find the largest k where Fib(k) <=n, and then m=k-2.\n\nWait, but in the code, the Fib_list is built as [2,3,5,8,13,...], which is Fib(3), Fib(4), Fib(5), etc.\n\nSo, for Fib_list[k], it's Fib(k+2).\n\nThus, for Fib_list[k] <=n, the maximum m is (k+2) -2 =k.\n\nSo, for Fib_list[k] <=n, m=k.\n\nThus, the code should find the largest k where Fib_list[k] <=n, and m=k.\n\nThus, for n=4, the largest Fib_list[k] is 3, which is at k=1. So m=1.\n\nBut this contradicts the correct m=2.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, for Fib_list[k] = Fib(k+2).\n\nSo, for Fib_list[k] =3, it's Fib(4), which is 3. So m=4-2=2.\n\nAh! So m= (k+2) -2 =k.\n\nThus, for k=1, m=1.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, Fib_list[k] is Fib(k+2).\n\nSo, for Fib_list[k] = Fib(m+2).\n\nSo, m+2 =k+2 → m=k.\n\nThus, for k=1, m=1.\n\nBut for n=4, m=2 is possible.\n\nWait, this is getting really confusing.\n\nPerhaps the best way is to recompute for each Fib_list[k], what is the corresponding m.\n\nLet me make a table:\n\nk | Fib_list[k] | Fib(k+2) | m = ?\n\n0 | 2 → Fib(3) → m=1.\n\n1 |3 → Fib(4) → m=2.\n\n2 |5 → Fib(5) → m=3.\n\n3 |8 → Fib(6) → m=4.\n\n4 |13 → Fib(7) →m=5.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, for each k, m=k.\n\nThus, for n=4, the largest Fib_list[k] <=4 is 3, which is at k=1. So m=1.\n\nBut this is incorrect, because for n=4, the maximum m is 2.\n\nWait, what's the issue here.\n\nAh, perhaps the way the Fib_list is constructed is incorrect.\n\nWait, the Fib_list should include all Fib(k) up to 1018, but perhaps in the initial code, the list is built incorrectly.\n\nWait, let's re-express.\n\nThe Fib numbers are 2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597,...\n\nSo, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, Fib(7)=13, etc.\n\nSo, the Fib_list should be built as [2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597].\n\nWait, but for n=4, the largest Fib(k) <=4 is 3, which is Fib(4).\n\nSo, for Fib(k)=3, m=4-2=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, in the Fib_list, the index is 1, which corresponds to Fib(4)=3.\n\nThus, the code should generate the Fib_list as [2,3,5,8,13, ...], and for each Fib_list[k], it's Fib(k+2).\n\nThus, for a given n, find the largest k where Fib(k+2) <=n.\n\nSo, the code should generate Fib_list as follows:\n\nfib_list = [2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597]\n\nThen, for each n, find the largest Fib(k) in fib_list where Fib(k) <=n, and then m =k.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nn=4: The largest Fib(k) <=4 is 3, which is at index 1. So m=1.\n\nBut that's incorrect because for n=4, the maximum m is 2.\n\nThus, this approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the Fib_list should be generated as Fib(2), Fib(3), etc.\n\nNo, perhaps I'm getting mixed up between the Fib indices.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the problem is similar to finding the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to n, and then m is the index.\n\nBut in that case, for n=4, the largest Fib is 3, which is index 4 in the standard Fib sequence (if starting from Fib(1)=1).\n\nBut this is getting too tangled.\n\nPerhaps another way is to precompute for each m, the minimal number of players, and then for each n, find the largest m where the minimal players is <=n.\n\nSo, let's compute for m=1,2,3,4,5, etc., the minimal players.\n\nm | min_players\n\n1 |2\n\n2 |3\n\n3 |5\n\n4 |8\n\n5 |13\n\n6 |21\n\n7 |34\n\n8 |55\n\n9 |89\n\n10 |144\n\n11 |233\n\n12 |377\n\n13 |610\n\n14 |987\n\n15 |1597\n\n16 |2584 (but 2584>1018)\n\nSo, for n=1018, the largest m is 14, since 987<=1018 <1597.\n\nFor n=4, the largest m where min_players[m]<=4 is m=2, because min_players[3]=5>4.\n\nThus, for each n, iterate through m from 1 upwards, checking if min_players[m] <=n.\n\nOnce the first m is found where min_players[m]>n, return m-1.\n\nSo, for n=4:\n\nCheck m=1: min_players[1]=2<=4 → continue.\n\nm=2:3<=4 → continue.\n\nm=3:5>4 → stop. So the maximum m is 2.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nCompute min_players for m=1,2,... up to the maximum where min_players[m] <=1018.\n\nThen, for a given n, find the largest m where min_players[m] <=n.\n\nImplementing this approach:\n\nWe can precompute the min_players for m up to the maximum possible m where min_players[m] <=1018.\n\nThen, for each n, perform a binary search on the min_players array to find the largest m.\n\nThus, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nprecompute min_players = [2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597]\n\nWait, but 1597 is for m=15, which is 1597>1018.\n\nSo, the maximum m is 14.\n\nThus, the list for m from 1 to 14 is:\n\nmin_players = [2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987]\n\nNow, for a given n, find the largest m where min_players[m] <=n.\n\nBut how to map the index to m.\n\nFor example, min_players[0]=2 → m=1.\n\nmin_players[1]=3 → m=2.\n\nmin_players[2]=5 → m=3.\n\nThus, the index in min_players is m-1.\n\nSo, the code can:\n\n- Precompute min_players as a list, where min_players[i] is the minimal players for m=i+1.\n\nThus, for i in 0..len(min_players)-1, m=i+1.\n\nThus, for n=4, the largest min_players[i] <=4 is min_players[1]=3, which is for m=2.\n\nThus, the code can proceed as:\n\nread n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given that two players can only face each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the problem can be modeled using Fibonacci numbers. The minimal number of players required for the winner to play `m` games follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, the minimal number of players needed for `m` games is given by the `(m+2)`-th Fibonacci number.\n\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The minimal number of players required for the winner to play `m` games is the `(m+2)`-th Fibonacci number. This is because each subsequent game the winner plays must be against an opponent who has either played the same number or one fewer game than the winner.\n2. **Precompute Fibonacci Numbers**: We precompute the Fibonacci numbers up to the largest possible value that is less than or equal to 1018 (the maximum number of players).\n3. **Binary Search**: For a given number of players `n`, we use binary search to find the largest Fibonacci number that is less than or equal to `n`. The index of this Fibonacci number gives us the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef max_games(n):\n    # Precompute the list of minimal players for each m\n    min_players = [2, 3]\n    while True:\n        next_p = min_players[-1] + min_players[-2]\n        if next_p > 1018:\n            break\n        min_players.append(next_p)\n    \n    # Find the largest m where min_players[m-1] <=n\n    low, high = 0, len(min_players) - 1\n    result = 0\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if mid >= len(min_players):\n            if mid - 1 == len(min_players) - 1 and min_players[mid - 1] <= n:\n                result = len(min_players) - 1\n            else:\n                result = mid - 1\n            break\n        if min_players[mid] <= n:\n            result = mid\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    return result\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(max_games(n))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Fibonacci Numbers**: We generate a list of Fibonacci numbers starting from 2, 3, and so on, until the next number exceeds 1018.\n2. **Binary Search**: For the given number of players `n`, we perform a binary search on the precomputed list of Fibonacci numbers to find the largest number that is less than or equal to `n`. The index of this number gives us the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of games using properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limit of input constraints.",
