Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Andrew and Eugene are playing a game with string substitutions. The goal is to process a series of substitution queries on a string and then compute the number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again carefully to understand all the details.\n\nThe problem says that each query is of the form \"di->ti\". For each such query, every occurrence of digit di in the string s is replaced by ti. The order of the queries matters because each one is applied in sequence.\n\nFor example, if the string is '123123' and the first query is \"2→00\", it becomes \"10031003\". Then another query \"3→\" replaces all 3s with empty strings, resulting in \"1212\".\n\nAfter processing all queries, we need to compute the numeric value of the resulting string, ignoring leading zeros unless it's the only digit (like zero), and then find its remainder when divided by 1e9+7.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, let's think about how to represent the transformations efficiently. Since the string can be modified multiple times with overlapping substitutions, it's not straightforward to apply each substitution step by step as strings, especially for large n and s. Processing each substitution naively could be inefficient, but given the constraints (s up to 105 characters, n up to 105), even a straightforward approach might work.\n\nWait, but each substitution could potentially change multiple digits at once. So for each query, I need to replace all instances of di in the current s with ti.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read the initial string s.\n2. For each query, replace all occurrences of di in s with ti.\n3. After all queries, convert the resulting string into a number, modulo 1e9+7, handling leading zeros appropriately.\n\nBut wait, applying each substitution step by step might be computationally manageable since the maximum length is 105, and each substitution could increase or decrease the length, but the total steps are 105, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the key steps are processing each query, replacing the digits, and then computing the result.\n\nBut how to handle the substitutions? Because for each query, it's possible that a digit di is present in the current s, and we have to replace each occurrence of di with ti.\n\nAn important point is that each substitution is global for the current state of the string. So for example, after substitution, new digits may be introduced that could be subject to future substitutions.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Start with the initial string.\n- For each query in order:\n   - For each character in the current string, if it's equal to di, replace it with ti.\n   - Update the string accordingly.\n   \nWait, no. Wait, no: each substitution is done on the entire string. So for each query, we scan the entire string and replace every occurrence of di with ti.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for example, the initial string is '123123'.\n\nFirst query: \"2→00\". So in the string, any '2' is replaced by '00'. So '123123' becomes '1' + '00' + '3' + '00' + '3' → '1003003'? Wait, wait, no. Let me see: the original string is 1 2 3 1 2 3.\n\nReplacing 2 with 00: each 2 becomes two 0s. So the string becomes 1 00 3 1 00 3 → concatenated as 10031003.\n\nThen the next query is \"3→\", so replace 3 with empty string. So in the string, each 3 is removed. So 1 00 3 becomes 1 00. But in the string, it's '10031003', so replacing 3s gives 1 00 1 00 3 → wait, no. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the string after first substitution is '10031003'. Now, in this string, the digits are 1, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 3.\n\nWhen we replace 3 with empty string, each 3 is removed. So the string becomes '1001 00' → wait, no. Let's see:\n\nEach 3 is replaced by nothing. So:\n\nOriginal: 1 0 0 3 1 0 0 3\nAfter replacement: 1 0 0 1 0 0 (since the two 3s are removed). So the string becomes '100100'.\n\nWait, no: wait, the positions are 0-based? Or does it matter. No, the string is processed from left to right, each '3' is replaced regardless of context.\n\nSo the string '10031003' becomes '100100'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the substitution as a string operation, replacing each di with ti.\n\nIn Python, for each query, I can do s = s.replace(di, ti) for each substitution.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for each query, di is a single character, ti is a string. So for the current s, replace every occurrence of di with ti.\n\nWait, but what if ti contains the same digit as di? Like, if di is '2' and ti is '22', then the substitution will create more 2's, which can be replaced again in subsequent queries.\n\nYes, correct. So each substitution is applied to the current state of the string, including any changes made by previous substitutions.\n\nThus, the processing is straightforward: for each query, perform s = s.replace(di, ti).\n\nOnce all substitutions are done, the string s is processed to compute the number.\n\nNow, the next step is to compute the numeric value of s.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that when you represent s as a decimal number, ignore leading zeros. Except if the string is empty, it's zero.\n\nSo, for example, if after substitutions the string is '000', the number is 0. If it's '0123', the number is 123. If it's '123', it's 123.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Process all substitutions to get the final s.\n2. Compute the numeric value of s, ignoring leading zeros.\n3. Return this number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, how to compute the numeric value of s, considering that it can be up to 105 characters long. Converting directly to an integer could be problematic because Python can handle big integers, but for very large numbers, even Python may take time, but given the constraints, it's manageable.\n\nWait, the maximum length is 105, which is okay for Python to handle as an integer.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read the initial string s.\n- Read the number of queries n.\n- For each of the next n lines, parse the query into di and ti.\n- For each query, replace all instances of di in s with ti.\n- After all queries, process s into a number:\n   - If s is empty, output 0.\n   - Else, remove leading zeros. If after removing leading zeros, the string is empty (meaning all were zeros), output 0. Otherwise, output the remaining string as a number.\n\nCompute this number mod 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but for very large numbers, converting to an integer and then taking mod could be feasible, but since the modulus is fixed, perhaps there's a smarter way. However, for the given constraints, converting to an integer is manageable.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead s from input. Then read n. Then read n lines, each line is a query.\n\nFor each query, split on '->' to get di and ti. Then, s = s.replace(di, ti).\n\nOnce all queries are processed, compute the numeric value of s, stripping leading zeros, then mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, let's think about the example:\n\nIn the sample input:\n\nInitial s is '123123'\n\nn=1\n\nFirst query is '2->00', so s becomes '10031003'\n\nThen another query is '3->', so s becomes '1001' (Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nWait, the first substitution is '2→00', which turns '123123' into '10031003'.\n\nThen the second query is '3→', which replaces all 3s with empty string. So in '10031003', the 3s are at positions 3 and 6 (assuming 0-based). Replacing them with nothing gives '100100'.\n\nWait, no: the string '10031003' is 8 characters: 1, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 3.\n\nReplacing 3 with '' results in the string being 1,0,0,1,0,0, so the string becomes '100100'.\n\nWait, but the sample output after the second query is '1212'. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the sample input.\n\nWait, looking back at the example:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, the first query is 2→00. So the initial s is '123123' → after substitution, it's '10031003'.\n\nSecond query is 3→, which removes all 3s, turning it into '100100'.\n\nWait, but according to the sample note, after the second query, the string is '1212'. That suggests that perhaps the substitution is done differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the sample.\n\nWait, the sample note says:\n\nExample:\n\nInput is:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nOutput:\n\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\nWait, so after the first substitution, the string is '10031003'.\n\nThen, the second query is '3→' which replaces 3 with empty string. So the string becomes '1001' → but the sample output is '1212'. Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example. Let me re-examine the note.\n\nWait, the note says that the third sample has:\n\nInput:\n\n222\n\n2\n\n2→0\n\n0→7\n\nSo, processing this:\n\nInitial s is '222'.\n\nFirst query: replace 2 with 0 → '000'.\n\nSecond query: replace 0 with 7 → each 0 becomes 7. So '000' becomes '777'.\n\nWhich is why the output is '777'.\n\nWait, but for the second query, the substitution is '0→7'.\n\nAh, okay, so in the first substitution, the string becomes '000', and the second substitution replaces 0 with 7, making it '777'.\n\nSo, for the main example, the first substitution is '2→00', making '123123' become '10031003'.\n\nThe second substitution is '3→', so in '10031003', all 3s are replaced with nothing. So the 3s are at the fourth and seventh positions. Removing them gives '100100'.\n\nBut the sample output after the second query is '1212'.\n\nWait, that's confusing. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample's output is for each step, but the problem says to process all queries and output the final result.\n\nWait, no. The sample shows four outputs, but the input includes four lines. Wait, perhaps the sample is showing the intermediate steps. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample is a misrepresentation, and perhaps I shouldn't get stuck on it.\n\nIn any case, the code should correctly process each substitution in the order given.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nLoop through each query, apply s = s.replace(di, ti) for each substitution.\n\nOnce all queries are done, process the string into a number.\n\nNow, to implement this in Python:\n\nRead s from input.\n\nThen read n.\n\nThen for each of the next n lines, process the query.\n\nEach line is like 'di->ti', so split on '->' to get di and ti.\n\nBut in Python, the input lines may have '\\n' at the end. So, perhaps we should strip any whitespace.\n\nSo, for each query_line in the input:\n\nstrip any leading/trailing whitespace.\n\nsplit into two parts, di and ti.\n\ndi is the first part, which is a single character.\n\nti is the second part, which can be empty.\n\nThen, s = s.replace(di, ti).\n\nYes.\n\nOnce all substitutions are done, process the final s.\n\nProcessing s:\n\nIf s is empty → output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nConvert s into a number.\n\nTo handle leading zeros:\n\n- Strip leading zeros.\n\n- If the result is empty, output 0.\n\n- Else, output the stripped string.\n\nBut wait, what if s is '0000'? Stripping leads to empty string, so output 0.\n\nBut what about '000123'? Stripping leads to '123'.\n\nOnce we have this stripped string, we compute its integer value mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, for s = '0', it's 0, but if it's '000', it's also 0.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nstripped = s.lstrip('0')\n\nif stripped == '': result is 0.\n\nelse: result is int(stripped) mod MOD.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nMOD = 10**9 +7\n\nfinal_str = s after substitutions.\n\nif not final_str:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    stripped = final_str.lstrip('0')\n\n    if not stripped:\n\n        print(0)\n\n    else:\n\n        num = int(stripped)\n\n        print(num % MOD)\n\nWait, but wait: the problem statement says that leading zeros are ignored, except when the string is empty (which is treated as zero). So, for example, if s is '00012', it's treated as 12.\n\nSo the code logic above handles that.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nTesting this logic with the sample:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, the input seems to have lines with newline separators. So, in Python, reading via input().strip() would help.\n\nWait, perhaps the first line is s, which is '123123'.\n\nn is 1.\n\nThen comes the query lines.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is written as:\n\nFirst line: '123123'\n\nsecond line: 1\n\nthird line: '2->00'\n\nfourth line: '123123'\n\nfifth line: 1\n\nsixth line: '3->'\n\nand so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is presented as:\n\nThe input is:\n\n123123\n\n1\n\n2->00\n\n123123\n\n1\n\n3->\n\n222\n\n2\n\n2->0\n\n0->7\n\n1000000008\n\n0\n\nSo, processing each query:\n\nInitially, s = '123123'.\n\nFirst query: 2→00 → s becomes '10031003'.\n\nSecond query: 3→ → replace 3 with empty. So in '10031003', 3's are replaced with nothing, giving '100100'.\n\nThird query: '222' → n is 2. So the third line is '2->0' → replace 2 with '0'. So s is '100100' → after substitution, any 2's are replaced with 0. But '100100' has no 2's, so remains '100100'.\n\nFourth query: '0->7' → replace 0 with 7. So each 0 becomes 7. So '100100' → '717177'.\n\nWait, but the sample output after this step is '777', which suggests that perhaps the third query is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the queries wrong. Let me recount.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\nLine 1: '123123' → s = '123123'\n\nLine 2: 1 → n=1\n\nLine 3: '2->00' → s becomes '10031003'\n\nLine 4: '123123' → wait, that's strange. Oh wait, perhaps the sample input is written with the first line being the string, then n, then n lines of queries.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is structured as:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nn = 1\n\nquery1: 2->00\n\nThen, another query?\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWhich would mean:\n\nAfter reading s as '123123', n=1, then the first query is '2->00' → s becomes '10031003'.\n\nThen, perhaps another set of queries: but wait, perhaps the sample has four queries.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual input is:\n\ns is '123123'\n\nn is 1\n\nthen one query: '2->00'\n\nso after that, s is '10031003'\n\nthen, another line: s is '123123' again?\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is a typo, and the actual input is:\n\ns is '123123'\n\nn is 1\n\nthen one query: '2->00'\n\nso the output is '10031003'.\n\nBut the sample's output shows four steps, each after a query. So perhaps the sample is illustrative of the process, not the actual input.\n\nWell, perhaps it's better to proceed with writing the code as per the problem statement.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the substitution could be applied multiple times, and the same digit could be substituted in different ways.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nRead s = input().strip()\n\nn = int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    line = input().strip()\n\n    # Split into di and ti, using '->' as separator.\n\n    parts = line.split('->')\n\n    di = parts[0]\n\n    ti = parts[1] if len(parts) >1 else ''\n\n    s = s.replace(di, ti)\n\nOnce all substitutions are done, process s.\n\nBut wait, what if di is longer than 1 character? According to the problem statement, di is exactly one digit. So parts[0] must be a single character.\n\nSo, the code is safe.\n\nNow, processing s:\n\nif s is empty → output 0.\n\nelse:\n\nstripped = s.lstrip('0')\n\nif stripped is empty → output 0.\n\nelse → output int(stripped) mod MOD.\n\nSo, code:\n\nMOD = 10**9 +7\n\nif not s:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    stripped = s.lstrip('0')\n\n    if not stripped:\n\n        print(0)\n\n    else:\n\n        num = int(stripped)\n\n        print(num % MOD)\n\nTesting this code.\n\nTest case 1:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nn=1\n\nquery: '2->00'\n\ns becomes '10031003'.\n\nAfter processing, stripped is '10031003' → 10031003 mod MOD is 10031003.\n\nSample output is '10031003'.\n\nSo code returns 10031003.\n\nAnother test case:\n\ns='222'\n\nn=2\n\nqueries:\n\n'2->0' → s becomes '000'\n\nthen '0->7' → s becomes '777'\n\nstripped is '777' → 777 mod MOD is 777.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case:\n\ns='1000000008'\n\nn=0 → no queries.\n\ns is '1000000008' → stripped is '1000000008' → 1000000008 mod MOD.\n\nSince 1e9+7 is 1000000007, 1000000008 mod 1e9+7 is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nAnother edge case: s is empty after substitutions.\n\nLike, initial s is '0', and substitution is '0->' → empty string.\n\nSo after substitution, s is empty. Output is 0.\n\nAnother case: s is '0000' → stripped is empty → output 0.\n\nAnother case: s is '0' → stripped is '0' → output 0.\n\nAnother case: s is '123' → stripped is '123' → 123 mod MOD is 123.\n\nAnother case: s is '999' → stripped is '999' → 999 mod MOD is 999.\n\nAll these cases are handled.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a series of substitution queries on an initial string of digits and then compute the resulting number modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). The goal is to efficiently handle each substitution and convert the final string into the required numeric form.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: Read the initial string and the number of queries.\n2. **Processing Queries**: For each query, replace all occurrences of the specified digit with the given substring.
