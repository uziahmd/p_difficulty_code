Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form .

That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|.

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a regular polygon, each internal angle can be calculated. The formula for the internal angle of a regular n-gon is (n-2)*180 / n degrees. But wait, that's the internal angle. But when forming an angle with three vertices, how does that translate?\n\nWait, no, the problem is about creating an angle by selecting three points v1, v2, v3. The angle is formed at v2, between the two lines from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. So I need to find the possible angles that can be formed by any triplet of vertices in the polygon.\n\nBut since the polygon is regular, the positions of the vertices are symmetric. So maybe there's a pattern or optimal way to choose these points.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the regular polygon. Each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. The central angle between consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees. So the arc between any two adjacent vertices is 360/n.\n\nWhen you pick three vertices, say v1, v2, v3, they form a triangle. The angle at v2 depends on the arcs subtended by v1 and v3 relative to v2.\n\nWait, in a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So for the angle at v2, the angle formed is equal to half the measure of the arc that's opposite to it, which is the arc from v1 to v3 passing through the points not including v2.\n\nWait, maybe I should draw this. Suppose the polygon is a regular n-gon inscribed in a unit circle. Then the central angle between consecutive vertices is 2π/n radians. So, if I have three points A, B, C, the angle at B is determined by the arcs AB and BC, but wait, no—actually, the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle at B is equal to half the measure of the arc AC that doesn't contain B.\n\nSo for example, if the polygon has vertices arranged in order 1, 2, 3, ..., n around the circle, then for a triplet (v1, v2, v3) in clockwise order, the arc from v1 to v3 that doesn't pass through v2 is some multiple of the base angle 2π/n. The angle at v2 would then be half of that.\n\nHmm, that makes sense. So the angle at v2 is (k * 360/n)/2 degrees, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 when moving around the circle without passing through v2. Wait, but since the polygon is convex, the arc between v1 and v3 could be either the shorter path or the longer path. But since we're dealing with a regular convex polygon, the minimal arc is considered for the inscribed angle.\n\nWait no, actually, the inscribed angle depends on the arc that is intercepted by the two points. For a regular polygon, the angle at v2 will be the same regardless of the direction, because the polygon is symmetric. So perhaps the angle can be represented as (d * (180/n)) degrees, where d is the number of sides apart v1 and v3 are from v2, but considering the minimal arc.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this. Let's say the polygon is numbered 1 to n in order around the circle. For a given v2, say vertex i, then the possible angles at i can be formed by choosing v1 and v3 such that they are k steps away from i in either direction. So for each possible k, the angle formed is (k * (180/n)) degrees. Because the arc between v1 and v3 is 2k * (360/(2n)) = k*(360/n), right? Wait, no: each side corresponds to a central angle of 360/n degrees. So moving k steps from v1 in one direction would give a total arc length of k * (360/n). Then the inscribed angle is half that, so (k * 360/n ) / 2 = (k * 180)/n degrees.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So for a given v2, the possible angles that can be formed are multiples of 180/n degrees, depending on how far apart v1 and v3 are.\n\nFor example, in a square (n=4), each internal angle is 90 degrees. The possible angles when selecting three vertices would be 45 degrees (when k=1, since 1*180/4=45) or 90 degrees (k=2, 2*180/4=90). So when a is 67, the closest is 45 (since 67-45=22, 90-67=23). So the sample input 4 67 outputs 45.\n\nWait, but in the sample input 4 68, the output is 90, which is closer to 68 than 45 is.\n\nSo the approach is: for each possible k (from 1 to floor(n/2)), compute the angle (k * 180 /n) and see which one is closest to 'a'.\n\nBut wait, what's the range of k? Since the polygon is regular, the maximum k is (n-1)/2, because beyond that, it's the same as the other side. For example, in a pentagon, k can be 1 or 2, as 3 would be equivalent to -2 steps in a circle.\n\nSo for each possible k (1 to m, where m is floor((n-1)/2)), compute the angle for that k, and then for each possible v2, see what's the best k to use.\n\nBut wait, for each v2, the available ks are limited. For example, in a square (n=4), each v2 can have k=1 and k=2.\n\nWait, but for each v2, the maximum k is min(v2-1, n - v2). Because you can't go beyond the start or end of the polygon. Or wait, no—because when you choose v1 and v3, they must be on the sides of v2. So for v2, the possible k is up to (n-1)/2, but perhaps limited by the actual positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given k, the possible v2 is every vertex except those that would make the selection impossible. But maybe that's complicating things.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal approach is to try all possible triplets of v1, v2, v3, but that's O(n^3) which is acceptable for n up to 105. 105^3 is about a million, which is manageable.\n\nBut wait, for n=105, 105^3 is about 1.1 million, which is acceptable for Python.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible k (1 to m), compute the angle (k * 180 /n) and see if it's close to a. Then, for each k, find the best possible triplet.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal solution is to find the k that gives the angle closest to a, and then arrange the triplet accordingly.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. For each possible k in 1 to m (where m is floor((n-1)/2)), compute the angle theta_k = (k * 180)/n degrees.\n\n2. Find the k that minimizes |theta_k - a|. If there are multiple, choose the smallest k, or any.\n\n3. Once k is chosen, find a triplet (v1, v2, v3) where v2 is any vertex, and v1 is k steps before v2, and v3 is k steps after v2 (or vice versa, depending on direction).\n\nWait, but in a regular polygon, the arrangement can be clockwise or counter-clockwise, but the angle remains the same. So for each v2, the triplet can be arranged such that v1 is (v2 -k) mod n, and v3 is (v2 +k) mod n. Or, alternatively, v1 is (v2 +k) and v3 is (v2 -k), but perhaps it's the same angle.\n\nWait, no, because the inscribed angle depends on the arc between v1 and v3. So the angle is (k * 180)/n regardless of the direction. So whether you take k steps clockwise or counter-clockwise, the angle is the same.\n\nTherefore, for any v2, the triplet (v2 -k, v2, v2 +k) will form an angle of theta_k at v2.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- For each possible k (from 1 to m), calculate theta_k.\n\n- Find the k that's closest to a. If multiple, pick the smallest or any.\n\nOnce k is found, then for any v2, the triplet (v2 -k, v2, v2 +k) would form the angle theta_k.\n\nBut wait, v2 -k and v2 +k must be within the polygon's vertices, so their indices must be between 1 and n. So for example, if v2 is 1 and k is 3, v2 -k would be n-2 (assuming 1-based indexing). Similarly, if v2 is n and k is 1, v2 +k would wrap around to 1.\n\nSo in code, when computing v1 and v3, we have to ensure that they are within 1..n.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to consider the polygon as 0-based, but since the problem uses 1-based numbering, perhaps it's better to manage 1-based indices.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n- Precompute all possible k from 1 to m, where m is (n-1)//2.\n\n- For each k, compute theta_k = (k * 180)/n.\n\n- Compute the absolute difference between theta_k and a, and track the k with the smallest difference.\n\n- Once the best k is found, select any v2 (probably the first one, like 1), and then set v1 = v2 -k, v3 = v2 +k, adjusting modulo n as necessary.\n\nWait, but in code, subtracting k may result in a number less than 1, so we can adjust by adding n if needed.\n\nFor example, for v2=1, k=3, n=5:\n\nv1 = 1 -3 = -2 → add 5 to get 3.\n\nv3 = 1 +3 =4.\n\nSo the triplet is (3,1,4).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo in code, for a given v2, v1 = (v2 -k) % n, but since we want 1-based, perhaps compute as:\n\nv1 = v2 -k\n\nif v1 <1: add n until it's >=1.\n\nSimilarly for v3.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to compute v1 and v3 as follows:\n\nv1 = v2 -k\n\nif v1 <=0: add n.\n\nv1 = (v2 -k -1) %n +1\n\nSame for v3.\n\nWait, let's test it.\n\nSuppose n=4, v2=1, k=2.\n\nv1 = 1-2 = -1 → (-1-1) mod4 = -2 mod4 = 2 → +1 → 3?\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: to calculate v1 and v3 correctly within 1..n.\n\nAnother way is:\n\nv1 = v2 -k\n\nif v1 <1: v1 +=n\n\nSimilarly for v3.\n\nBut that could lead to v1 being greater than n, but wait, since the polygon is circular, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nv1 = (v2 -k -1) %n +1\n\nThis works because (x mod n) gives 0-based index, then +1 to make it 1-based.\n\nLet me test:\n\nn=4, v2=1, k=2.\n\n(1-2-1) mod4 = (-2) mod4 = 2 → 2+1=3 → correct.\n\nv3 = (1+2-1) mod4 +1? Wait, no, for v3 it's v2 +k.\n\nWait, v3 is v2 +k, but again, if it's larger than n, it wraps around.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nv1 = ((v2 -k -1) %n ) +1\n\nv3 = ((v2 +k -1) %n ) +1\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nFor example, n=5, v2=5, k=3.\n\nv1 = (5-3-1) mod5 +1 → (1) mod5 +1=2.\n\nv3 = (5+3-1) mod5 +1 →7 mod5=2 →3.\n\nSo triplet is (2,5,3). But wait, in a pentagon, 5 is followed by 1, so 5-3 is 2, 5+3 is 8, which mod5 is 3. So the triplet is 2,5,3.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the steps in code are:\n\n1. Read n and a.\n\n2. Compute m = (n-1) // 2.\n\n3. For each k from 1 to m:\n\n   a. Compute theta_k = (k * 180) / n\n\n   b. Compute the absolute difference between theta_k and a.\n\n   c. Keep track of the k with the smallest difference.\n\n   d. If multiple k's have the same minimal difference, choose the smallest k.\n\n4. Once the optimal k is found, select a v2 (like 1, or any other). For example, choose v2=1.\n\n5. Compute v1 and v3 as per the formulas above.\n\n6. Output the triplet v1, v2, v3.\n\nBut wait, is selecting v2=1 always the best? What if choosing a different v2 leads to a better triplet? Or does it not matter because the angle is the same for any v2 with the same k?\n\nNo, because the angle is the same for any v2. So regardless of which v2 we choose, the angle theta_k is fixed. So the choice of v2 doesn't affect the angle, only the specific triplet.\n\nBut the problem requires to choose any triplet that forms the angle as close as possible to a. So any v2 is fine, as long as the angle is theta_k.\n\nSo perhaps the first possible triplet is sufficient.\n\nNow, what about the case where a is exactly achievable? For example, in the first sample input, a=15, and n=3, each internal angle is 60, which is larger than 15. So the closest is 60, which is 45 away. But wait, no, the sample says that the output is 60 degrees because it's the only possible angle.\n\nWait, the first sample input is 3 15, and the output is 60 degrees. So that's the only possible angle, so it's correct.\n\nIn another example, when a=180, which is the maximum possible, since the largest possible angle in a regular polygon is 180 (which occurs when two points are diametrically opposite, but for even n only). For example, in n=4, the maximum angle is 90 degrees. Wait, but that's the internal angle. Wait, no, wait, the internal angle is 90 for square, but when you select three points in a square, the maximum angle possible is 90 degrees. Wait, no—wait, no. When you have a square, and you pick three consecutive points, the angle at the middle point is 90 degrees. If you pick the points 1,2,4, then the angle at 2 is 135 degrees. Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the angle calculation. Because earlier reasoning was based on the inscribed angle, but perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, the angle at v2 is formed by the two edges from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. The shape of the polygon is such that the points are ordered, so the angle is determined by the arcs between the points.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle is not just based on the minimal k steps, but also depends on the polygon's structure.\n\nWait, perhaps my earlier approach is incorrect. Because in the square example, selecting points 1,2,4 creates an angle at 2 of 135 degrees. How?\n\nBecause the arc from 1 to 4 is 270 degrees (since 1 is next to 2, then 3, then 4; moving clockwise, it's three steps, each 90 degrees, so 270). The inscribed angle is half that, which is 135 degrees.\n\nAh, right! So the earlier idea is correct. So the angle is (k * 180)/n degrees, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 around the circle, not counting v2.\n\nWait, but in this case, for n=4, k can be 1 or 3, but in terms of the minimal steps, it's 1 (since 3 is the other way). So for k=3, the angle is (3 * 180)/4 = 135 degrees. But for k=1, it's 45 degrees. So the maximum possible angle is 135, not 90.\n\nHmm, that changes things. So for a square, the maximum angle is 135, not 90. So in the second sample, when a is 67, 45 is closer than 135, but when a is 68, 135 is closer than 45 (since 68-45=23, 135-68=67, which is worse. Wait, no: 68 is closer to 67 (distance 1) than to 135 (67). So why did the sample output choose 90?\n\nWait, the sample input is '4 67' and the output is 45. Because 67 is closer to 45 than to 90.\n\nWait, but according to the note, in the second sample, the angle is 45 degrees, which is better than 90. So why is 45 better than 135?\n\nBecause 45 is closer to 67 than both 90 and 135.\n\nAh, right. So the approach is to check all possible ks and find the one that gives the angle closest to a.\n\nSo, the algorithm is correct.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each possible k (from 1 to m), compute theta_k.\n\n- Find the k that is closest to a.\n\n- Once k is found, create a triplet as (v2 -k, v2, v2 +k), adjusted for wrapping around.\n\nNow, implementing this in code.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps in code.\n\nRead n and a.\n\nCompute m = (n-1) // 2.\n\nInitialize best_k to 1, best_diff to a large number.\n\nFor k in 1 to m:\n\n   theta = (k * 180) / n\n\n   diff = abs(theta - a)\n\n   if diff < best_diff or (diff == best_diff and k < best_k):\n\n       best_k = k\n\n       best_diff = diff\n\nOnce best_k is found, select v2 as 1 (any choice, but 1 is easy).\n\nCompute v1 = (v2 - best_k - 1) %n +1\n\nv3 = (v2 + best_k -1) %n +1\n\nWait, no: the formula for v1 and v3.\n\nWait, for v1, it's v2 - best_k steps, but considering 1-based.\n\nSo:\n\nv1 = v2 - best_k\n\nif v1 <1: v1 +=n\n\nSimilarly for v3:\n\nv3 = v2 + best_k\n\nif v3 >n: v3 -=n\n\nWait, but in code, using modulo might be easier.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nv1 = (v2 - best_k -1) %n +1\n\nv3 = (v2 + best_k -1) %n +1\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nv2 = 1\n\nv1 = (v2 - best_k -1) %n +1\n\nv3 = (v2 + best_k -1) %n +1\n\nThen, print v1, v2, v3.\n\nBut wait, what if best_k is zero? No, since k starts from 1.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 3 15\n\nm = (3-1)//2 = 1.\n\nk=1.\n\ntheta = 180/3=60.\n\ndiff=45.\n\nSo the triplet is:\n\nv2=1.\n\nv1 = (1-1-1) mod3 +1 → (-1 mod3)=2 → 3.\n\nv3 = (1+1-1) mod3 +1 → 1 mod3=1 → 2.\n\nSo triplet is 3,1,2.\n\nWhich is correct as per the sample, but the sample output is '1 2 3'. Hmm, why?\n\nWait, perhaps because the triplet can be arranged in any order as long as the angle is at v2.\n\nWait, no, the triplet is (v1, v2, v3) with the angle at v2. So the order is v1, v2, v3.\n\nSo in the first sample, the triplet is 3,1,2. But the sample output is 1 2 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the triplet ordering wrong.\n\nWait, the problem statement says to output the three integers v1, v2, v3, where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides.\n\nSo the triplet is (v1, v2, v3), with v2 being the middle.\n\nSo in the first sample, the triplet 3,1,2 would imply that v2 is 1, and the angle is at 1 between 3 and 2.\n\nBut the sample output is 1,2,3. So in that case, the angle is at 2, between 1 and 3.\n\nWait, that suggests that the triplet can be arranged in any cyclic order as long as the angle is at the middle element.\n\nWait, perhaps the triplet can be arranged as (v2 -k, v2, v2 +k) in either order. So the triplet can be (v2, v1, v3) or (v2, v3, v1), but in terms of the angle, it's the same.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says to output the triplet in any order as long as the angle is at v2. So the order of v1 and v3 doesn't matter.\n\nBut the problem expects the triplet to be output in the order v1, v2, v3, regardless of their positions.\n\nWait, looking back at the sample:\n\nSample Input 3 15:\n\nThe output is 1 2 3, which implies that the angle is at 2, between 1 and 3. So the angle is 60 degrees, which is correct.\n\nBut according to our code, with v2=1, k=1, the triplet would be 3,1,2.\n\nBut the sample expects 1,2,3.\n\nAh, so perhaps the way to get the triplet is to arrange it so that v2 is in the middle, regardless of the order in which we select v1 and v3.\n\nSo, perhaps for the code, the triplet is (v2 -k, v2, v2 +k), but when arranging, the order is v1, v2, v3, which could be any permutation as long as v2 is in the middle.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the triplet is 1,2,3, which implies that v1 is 1, v2 is 2, v3 is 3. So the angle is at 2, between 1 and 3.\n\nBut according to the code's approach, the triplet is (v2 -k, v2, v2 +k). So for v2=1, k=1, the triplet is 3,1,2. But the problem expects the triplet to be 1,2,3.\n\nSo perhaps the code needs to arrange the triplet such that v2 is in the middle.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should output the triplet as (v2 -k, v2, v2 +k) in that order, but when the triplet is 3,1,2, it's the same as 1,2,3 when considering that the angle is at 2.\n\nWait, no, because the triplet is ordered as v1, v2, v3, with v2 being the angle's vertex. So in the code's approach, the triplet is (v1, v2, v3), and in the sample, the correct triplet is (1,2,3), which corresponds to v1=1, v2=2, v3=3. So the angle is at 2, between 1 and 3.\n\nSo in the code, when we choose v2=2, and k=1, then v1=1, v3=3. So the triplet is 1,2,3, which is correct.\n\nBut earlier approach chooses v2=1, which leads to triplet 3,1,2. Which is also correct, but the sample prefers another arrangement.\n\nSo perhaps the code should choose v2 such that it's in the middle of the triplet. Or perhaps the code should choose v2 as the middle vertex.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal solution is to choose v2 such that the triplet is (v2 -k, v2, v2 +k), but arranged in the order v2 -k, v2, v2 +k. So that v2 is the middle element.\n\nWait, but in the code, when we choose v2=1, the triplet is 3,1,2. So v2 is in the middle. But the problem expects the triplet in the order 1,2,3.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should arrange the triplet so that the numbers are in increasing order, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should allow any arrangement as long as the angle is at v2, but the order of v1 and v3 doesn't matter.\n\nWait, the problem statement says to print three space-separated integers, which form the angle. So the triplet can be any permutation as long as the angle is at v2.\n\nWait, no. Because in the sample input, the triplet is printed as 1 2 3, implying that v2 is 2, and the others are 1 and 3.\n\nSo in the code, when choosing v2=2, the triplet becomes 1,2,3, which is what the sample expects.\n\nSo perhaps the code should not fix v2=1, but instead choose v2 such that the triplet is arranged in order. Like, for the triplet (v2 -k, v2, v2 +k), but arrange them in order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should find the triplet where v2 is the middle of the three points.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should choose v2 as the middle point of the triplet, which is (v1 +v3)/something.\n\nBut that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can iterate over all possible k, compute the best angle, and for each possible k, generate all possible triplets (v1, v2, v3) and find the one that is closest to a.\n\nBut that's O(m * n) time, which is acceptable for n=105 and m=52, giving 105*52=5460 iterations.\n\nBut that's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps the initial approach of selecting v2=1 is sufficient, but the problem's sample shows that the triplet may be arranged differently.\n\nSo perhaps the code should choose v2 in a way that allows the triplet to be as small as possible in terms of the vertex numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can choose v2 as the first possible vertex that allows the triplet to be in order.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should iterate over all possible k, and for each, iterate over all possible v2, and compute the triplet, and track the one that gives the angle closest to a.\n\nBut that's O(m*n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- For each k from 1 to m:\n\n   - For each v2 from 1 to n:\n\n      - Compute v1 = (v2 -k -1) modn +1\n\n      - Compute v3 = (v2 +k -1) modn +1\n\n      - Compute theta_k = (k*180)/n\n\n      - Compute the difference between theta_k and a.\n\n      - Track the triplet (v1, v2, v3) that has the minimal difference.\n\nBut wait, theta_k is the same for all v2 in a given k. Because theta_k is the angle for that particular k, regardless of v2.\n\nSo, the angle is the same for all triplets generated with the same k.\n\nSo, the minimal difference is the same across all v2 for a given k.\n\nThus, for each k, the best difference is the same for all v2.\n\nTherefore, to find the best triplet, it's sufficient to find the k that gives the minimal difference, and then choose any v2 (like 1, or the first v2 that allows a valid triplet).\n\nSo the initial approach is correct.\n\nBut in the first sample, the triplet is 3,1,2, but the sample expects 1,2,3.\n\nSo perhaps the code should arrange the triplet so that the numbers are in order, but that's not necessary.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"print three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them.\"\n\nSo, the order in which the triplet is printed doesn't matter as long as v2 is the vertex of the angle.\n\nSo, the code can output the triplet as (v2 -k, v2, v2 +k) in any order.\n\nBut in the sample, the output is 1,2,3, which is (v2=2, v1=1, v3=3). So the code's approach of choosing v2=1 would produce 3,1,2, but that's a valid triplet.\n\nBut the sample expects 1,2,3, which is another valid triplet.\n\nSo, in the code, perhaps choosing v2=1, but outputting the triplet as (v2, v1, v3) is not correct.\n\nWait, no, the triplet is (v1, v2, v3), with v2 being the middle.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"the angle is formed at v2, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides.\"\n\nSo, v1 and v3 are on the sides of v2, but the exact arrangement (order) of the triplet doesn't matter as long as v2 is the vertex of the angle.\n\nThus, the code's approach of outputting (v1, v2, v3) is correct.\n\nBut in the sample, the triplet is 1,2,3, which implies that the angle is at 2, between 1 and 3.\n\nBut according to the code, when v2=1 and k=1, the triplet is 3,1,2, which is also correct.\n\nSo, why does the sample output prefer 1,2,3?\n\nAh, because in the sample, the code's approach is to choose v2=1, but the sample's output is another valid triplet.\n\nSo, the code's output is correct, but the sample shows a different valid triplet.\n\nSo, the code's approach is correct, but the sample's output is just one of the possible correct answers.\n\nThus, the code's approach is correct.\n\nNow, let's proceed to write the code.\n\nWe'll read n and a.\n\nCompute m = (n-1) // 2.\n\nInitialize best_k to 1, best_diff to a large number.\n\nLoop k from 1 to m:\n\n   theta = (k * 180) / n\n\n   diff = abs(theta - a)\n\n   if diff < best_diff or (diff == best_diff and k < best_k):\n\n       best_k = k\n\n       best_diff = diff\n\nOnce best_k is found, select v2=1.\n\nCompute v1 and v3 as (v2 - best_k -1) %n +1 and (v2 + best_k -1) %n +1.\n\nPrint v1, v2, v3.\n\nWait, but in the sample 3 15:\n\nbest_k is 1, theta=60.\n\nv2=1.\n\nv1 = (1-1-1) mod3 +1 → (-1 mod3=2 → 3.\n\nv3 = (1+1-1) mod3 +1 → 1 mod3=1 → 2.\n\nSo triplet is 3,1,2.\n\nBut the sample expects 1,2,3.\n\nSo, the code's output is 3 1 2, which is correct, but the sample's output is 1 2 3.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, any correct triplet is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code's output is correct, but the sample's output is another correct triplet.\n\nThus, the code should output any correct triplet.\n\nBut perhaps the code should arrange the triplet so that v1 is the smallest, v2 is next, v3 is the largest.\n\nIn that case, the code would need to arrange the triplet in order.\n\nSo, the code can compute v1, v2, v3, then sort them, but ensure that v2 is the middle.\n\nBut wait, v2 is already the vertex of the angle, so it's the middle of the triplet.\n\nThus, the triplet can be arranged in any order as long as v2 is the middle.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can arrange the triplet as (min(v1, v3), v2, max(v1, v3)), but that's not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should arrange the triplet as (v1, v2, v3) in the order of their positions in the polygon.\n\nBut that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should choose v2 as the middle of the triplet, but that's not necessary.\n\nGiven that the problem allows any correct triplet, the code's current approach is correct.\n\nSo, in the sample, the code produces 3 1 2, which is correct.\n\nBut the sample expects 1 2 3.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should choose v2=2 in the first sample.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the code should not fix v2 as 1, but instead choose v2 such that the triplet is as per the sample.\n\nBut that's not efficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can loop through all possible v2 and choose the triplet that is lexicographically smallest.\n\nBut that's more complex.\n\nBut given the problem's constraints, the initial approach is sufficient.\n\nThus, the code proceeds as described.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where a is 180 degrees? For example, in a regular polygon, is it possible to have an angle of 180 degrees?\n\nOnly if the polygon is a digon, which isn't allowed (n >=3). So for n=4, the maximum angle is 135 degrees.\n\nSo, the code correctly handles that.\n\nAnother test case: n=4, a=67.\n\nAs per the sample, the code computes k=1, theta=45.\n\nWhich is closer to 67 than k=2 (90) is.\n\nSo, the triplet is 3,1,2.\n\nBut the sample output is 2 1 3, which is another valid triplet.\n\nThus, the code's approach is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=4, a=68.\n\nThe code would find k=1, theta=45, which is 23 away.\n\nk=2, theta=90, which is 22 away. So 90 is better.\n\nSo the code would choose k=2.\n\nThus, the triplet is (v2=1, v1=4, v3=2).\n\nWhich is 4,1,2.\n\nWhich is one of the correct options.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nSo, now writing the code.\n\nRead n and a from input.\n\nCompute m = (n-1)//2.\n\nInitialize best_k to 1, best_diff to a large value.\n\nLoop k from 1 to m:\n\n   theta = (k * 180) / n\n\n   diff = abs(theta - a)\n\n   if diff < best_diff:\n\n       update best_k and best_diff.\n\n   elif diff == best_diff and k < best_k:\n\n       update best_k.\n\nOnce best_k is determined, choose v2=1.\n\nCompute v1 and v3.\n\nBut wait, perhaps choosing v2=1 is not the best choice, as it may not be the lex smallest triplet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should choose the earliest v2 that allows the triplet to have the lex smallest order.\n\nBut that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can choose v2 as 1, and then output the triplet as (v1, v2, v3), which may not be in order.\n\nBut the sample shows that another triplet is acceptable.\n\nThus, the code's approach is correct.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\n\nm = (n-1) // 2\n\nbest_k = 1\n\nbest_diff = float('inf')\n\nfor k in range(1, m+1):\n\n    theta = (k * 180.0) / n\n\n    diff = abs(theta - a)\n\n    if diff < best_diff:\n\n        best_k = k\n\n        best_diff = diff\n\n    elif diff == best_diff and k < best_k:\n\n        best_k = k\n\nv2 = 1\n\nv1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The solution involves leveraging the properties of regular polygons and inscribed angles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Regular Polygons**: In a regular polygon, each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. The central angle between consecutive vertices is `360/n` degrees.\n2. **Inscribed Angle Theorem**: The angle formed by three vertices (v1, v2, v3) at v2 is half the measure of the arc intercepted by the lines from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3.\n3. **Possible Angles**: For each possible step size `k` (from 1 to `n//2`), compute the angle formed. The angle is given by `(k * 180) / n` degrees.\n4. **Closest Angle**: Track the angle closest to `a`. If multiple angles have the same closeness, choose the smallest `k`.\n5. **Triplet Formation**: For the chosen `k`, form the triplet (v1, v2, v3) such that v1 and v3 are `k` steps away from v2 on either side, wrapping around the polygon as necessary.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\nm = (n - 1) // 2\nbest_k = 1\nbest_diff = float('inf')\n\nfor k in range(1, m + 1):\n    theta = (k * 180.0) / n\n    diff = abs(theta - a)\n    if diff < best_diff or (diff == best_diff and k < best_k):\n        best_k = k\n        best_diff = diff\n\nv2 = 1\nv1 = (v2 - best_k - 1) % n + 1\nv3 = (v2 + best_k - 1) % n + 1\n\nprint(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of vertices `n` and the target angle `a`.\n2. **Calculate Maximum Step Size**: The maximum step size `m` is determined as `(n-1)//2`.\n3. **Determine Best k**: For each possible step size `k`, compute the angle and track the closest one to `a`.\n4. **Form Triplet**: Using the best `k`, compute the vertices v1 and v3 relative to v2 (chosen as vertex 1 for simplicity).\n5. **Output Result**: Print the triplet (v1, v2, v3) ensuring the angle is formed at v2.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the optimal triplet by leveraging geometric properties and ensures the solution is both correct and efficient.",
