In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles, and I have to find the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form at least one mentsu. A mentsu can be a triplet (three same tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, I need to process each of the three input strings. Each string represents a tile, like '1s' means 1 of suit s.\n\nSo for each of the three cases, I need to determine the minimal number of tiles to add to form a mentsu. Then, output the minimal for each case.\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem says that the input is three tiles, and we have to compute for each possible way to form a mentsu based on adding some tiles. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, wait, the output is three values, each corresponding to each initial set of three tiles. So for each initial set, compute the minimal number of tiles needed to form a mentsu.\n\nRight. So I'll process each of the three initial sets separately.\n\nSo, for each of the three initial hands, I need to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that the combined set includes at least one mentsu.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. For each initial hand, I can consider all possible ways to form a mentsu by adding some tiles. The minimal number of tiles added is what I need to find.\n\nBut considering that the initial hand has three tiles, adding any number of tiles (including zero) could allow a mentsu.\n\nBut enumerating all possibilities seems computationally heavy, but since the maximum tiles we can add is up to 4 (since the minimal required is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4), perhaps it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible mentsu that can be formed with the current tiles plus some added ones, compute the minimal number of tiles needed.\n\nSo, for each initial hand, I can generate all possible mentsu options and see what's the minimal tiles needed.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. For each of the three initial hands:\n   a. Generate all possible mentsu options that can be formed by adding some tiles.\n   b. For each such mentsu, calculate how many tiles are missing from the initial hand.\n   c. Find the minimal number of tiles needed across all possible mentsu options.\n\n2. The minimal number across all mentsu options is the answer for that initial hand.\n\nSo, the key is to find all possible mentsu that can be formed, including those that require adding new tiles.\n\nLet me think about how to represent the initial hands and possible mentsu.\n\nEach tile can be represented as a tuple of (number, suit). For example, '1m' is (1, 'm').\n\nSo, for each initial hand, which is a list of three tiles, I can count the frequency of each tile. For example, if two '9m's are present, the count is 2 for that tile.\n\nNow, for each possible mentsu, I need to check if the initial hand has enough tiles to form it, and how many more are needed.\n\nWhat's a mentsu? It's either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\nSo, I can iterate through all possible triplets and sequences, and for each, calculate how many tiles are needed beyond what's already present.\n\nThe minimal among these is the answer.\n\nBut considering all possible triplets and sequences might be computationally expensive, but given that the maximum initial hand size is 3, it's manageable.\n\nSo, let's think about how to generate all possible mentsu candidates.\n\nFirst, for triplets:\n\nFor each tile type (like 1m, 2m, ..., 9m; 1p, etc.), check if having three of them is possible. The initial hand may have some, so for each tile type, the required is max(3 - count, 0). Then, the minimal for triplets is the minimal such value across all tile types.\n\nFor sequences, it's a bit more complex. For each suit (m, p, s), we look for any possible triplet of consecutive numbers.\n\nLike, for numbers a, a+1, a+2. So, the possible a can range from 1 to 7.\n\nFor each such triplet, check how many of the required numbers are present in the initial hand. For example, if the sequence is 1m, 2m, 3m, and the initial hand has 2m and 3m, then only 1m is needed. So the required tiles would be 1.\n\nBut wait, the initial hand might have multiple copies of a tile. So, for the sequence, the counts of each required tile in the initial hand are considered.\n\nWait, but a sequence requires exactly one of each tile in the triplet. So, for a sequence, the initial hand can have any number of duplicates, but to form the sequence, you need at least one of each tile.\n\nSo, for each possible sequence (like 1m,2m,3m), we check how many tiles are missing in the initial hand. For each tile in the sequence, if the initial hand has none, that contributes 1 to the required tiles. If it has one, that's fine. If it has more than one, that's still fine.\n\nSo, for each sequence, the required tiles is the count of tiles in the sequence that are not present in the initial hand.\n\nWait, but the initial hand could have multiple copies of a tile. But for a sequence, you need exactly one of each tile. So, even if the initial hand has two 2m's, as long as at least one exists, that's sufficient.\n\nSo, for each possible sequence, the required tiles is the sum over each tile in the sequence of (1 if the initial hand doesn't have that tile, else 0).\n\nWait, no: because even if the initial hand has more than one, you only need one for the sequence.\n\nSo, for a sequence [a, a+1, a+2], the required tiles are:\n\nfor each x in {a, a+1, a+2}, if the initial hand has zero of x, then add 1.\n\nSo, for each sequence, the required is the number of x in the sequence that are not present in the initial hand.\n\nSimilarly for triplets: for each x in the triplet (all same), the required is max(3 - count_x, 0).\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each initial hand:\n\n- Compute the set of tiles present (without duplicates), along with their counts.\n\nThen, for all possible triplets (each tile type), compute the required tiles (3 - count_x) for each x.\n\nTake the minimal required among all triplets.\n\nFor all possible sequences (all possible a and suits), compute the required tiles as the sum of 1 for each x in the sequence that is not present in the initial hand.\n\nTake the minimal required among all sequences.\n\nThen, the minimal between the triplet and sequence minimal is the answer for this initial hand.\n\nWait, but perhaps a triplet and a sequence can be formed with different minimal tiles. So, for example, a triplet may require 0 tiles (already present), while a sequence may require 1. So, the overall minimal is 0.\n\nSo, the approach is to collect all possible mentsu possibilities, compute their required tiles, and choose the minimal.\n\nSo, the steps for each initial hand:\n\n1. Parse the three tiles into a dictionary: key is the tile (e.g., '1m'), value is the count (how many are present).\n\n2. For all possible triplet candidates (each possible tile):\n\n   a. For each tile x, calculate 3 - count[x]. If this is <=0, then the required is 0.\n\n   b. Collect all such required values, and find the minimal (which could be 0, if any triplet is already present).\n\n3. For all possible sequence candidates (each possible a and suit):\n\n   a. For the sequence [a, a+1, a+2] in the same suit, check each x in this sequence.\n\n   b. For each x, if the initial hand does not have x, then add 1 to the required.\n\n   c. Collect all required values, and find the minimal.\n\n4. The minimal between the triplet and sequence minima is the answer.\n\nSo, for each initial hand, we need to consider all possible triplets and sequences and find the minimal required.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, processing the initial hand:\n\nFor each of the three input lines, parse into a list of three tiles, then create a frequency dictionary.\n\nFor example, the first sample input is ['1s', '2s', '3s'] in the first line. Wait, no, wait: the input is three strings, each representing a tile. So, for the first example, the input is:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nSo, for the first initial hand, the tiles are '1s', '2s', '3s'. So, the frequency dictionary is {'1s':1, '2s':1, '3s':1}.\n\nFor the second initial hand, it's three '9m's: {'9m':3}.\n\nThird initial hand: '3p', '9m', '2p' → {'3p':1, '9m':1, '2p':1}.\n\nNow, for each initial hand, process the possible triplet and sequence mentsu.\n\nLet's take the third initial hand as an example.\n\nTriplet candidates:\n\nCheck each possible tile. For example:\n\n- 3p: current count is 1. Required is 2 more.\n\n- 9m: count is 1 → required 2.\n\n- 2p: count is 1 → required 2.\n\nOther tiles: for any other tile (like 1p), the count is 0 → required 3.\n\nSo, the minimal triplet required is 2 (for 3p, 9m, 2p, etc.) but wait, no: wait, no, wait, for triplet, it's three of the same tile. So, for 3p, the required is 3-1=2, which is the minimal for triplet.\n\nBut for sequences, let's see:\n\nPossible sequences in each suit:\n\nFor 'm':\n\nCheck sequences starting at a=1: 1m, 2m, 3m.\n\nDo the initial hand have 1m? No → add 1.\n\nDo they have 2m? No → add 1.\n\n3m? No → add 1. So total required is 3.\n\na=2: 2m,3m,4m. Check presence.\n\nInitial hand has 2p and 9m, but no 2m, 3m, 4m.\n\nSo, required 3.\n\nSimilarly for a=3: 3m,4m,5m. Initial hand has none, required 3.\n\nSame for a=4,5,6,7.\n\nSo for 'm' suit, all sequences require 3 tiles.\n\nFor 'p' suit:\n\nCheck sequences a=1: 1p,2p,3p.\n\nInitial hand has 2p and 3p → so 1p is missing. So required is 1.\n\na=2: 2p,3p,4p. Initial has 2p and 3p, 4p is missing → required 1.\n\na=3: 3p,4p,5p. Initial has 3p, others missing → required 2.\n\na=4: 4p,5p,6p → required 3.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo for 'p' suit, the minimal required is 1.\n\nSo, the minimal for sequences is 1.\n\nComparing triplet and sequence: triplet requires 2, sequence requires 1. So overall minimal is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the question is, how to implement this efficiently.\n\nSo, for each initial hand:\n\n- Create a frequency map: a dictionary where keys are the tiles (as strings like '1m'), and values are the counts.\n\n- For triplets:\n\n   Iterate through all possible tiles (each possible tile is 1m, 2m, ..., 9m; 1p, etc.). For each tile, compute required = max(3 - count.get(x, 0), 0). Keep track of the minimal required across all tiles.\n\n- For sequences:\n\n   For each suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n      For a in 1 to 7:\n\n         The sequence is [a, a+1, a+2], same suit.\n\n         For each x in this sequence:\n\n             if x is not in the frequency map, or frequency[x] == 0 → required += 1.\n\n         Keep track of the minimal required across all such sequences.\n\nSo, for each initial hand, the minimal required is the minimum between the triplet minimal and sequence minimal.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut how to generate all possible tiles?\n\nEach tile can be represented as a string. So, for each suit, the tiles are 1s, 2s, ..., 9s.\n\nWe can generate all possible tiles by looping through each suit and each number.\n\nAlternatively, for each suit, generate all possible a from 1 to 7 for sequences, and for triplets, all a from 1 to 9.\n\nWait, no. For triplets, each tile is a single tile, so for each of the 27 possible tiles (9 numbers × 3 suits), we need to check whether having three of them is possible.\n\nSo, for each initial hand, we loop through each of the 27 possible tiles.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nLet's outline the code structure.\n\nRead the input:\n\ntiles = []\nfor _ in range(3):\n    line = input().strip()\n    parts = line.split()\n    tiles.append(parts)\n\nSo, tiles is a list of three elements, each being a list of three strings.\n\nThen, for each initial_hand in tiles:\n\nprocess.\n\nFor each initial_hand:\n\nfrequency = {}\nfor tile in initial_hand:\n    frequency[tile] = frequency.get(tile, 0) + 1\n\nCompute triplet_min:\n\ntriplet_min = infinity\n\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for num in range(1, 10):\n        tile = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n        current_count = frequency.get(tile, 0)\n        required = max(3 - current_count, 0)\n        if required < triplet_min:\n            triplet_min = required\n\nCompute sequence_min:\n\nsequence_min = infinity\n\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for a in range(1, 8):  # a can be 1 to 7\n        seq = [f\"{a}{suit}\", f\"{a+1}{suit}\", f\"{a+2}{suit}\"]\n        required = 0\n        for x in seq:\n            if frequency.get(x, 0) == 0:\n                required +=1\n        if required < sequence_min:\n            sequence_min = required\n\nThen, overall_min = min(triplet_min, sequence_min)\n\nWait, but what if triplet_min is infinity? That can't happen because for each tile, required is at least 0, so triplet_min will be found.\n\nSimilarly for sequence_min.\n\nWait, for example, in the second initial hand of the sample: three 9m's.\n\nTriplet_min is 0, since 3 are present.\n\nSequence_min: for sequences in 'm' suit, a can be 1-7.\n\nFor a=7: 7m,8m,9m. We have 9m, but 7m and 8m are missing. So required is 2.\n\nBut the triplet_min is 0, which is better.\n\nSo, overall_min is 0.\n\nAnother example: the third initial hand: triplet requires 2 (for 3p, 9m, 2p), but sequence requires 1 (for the 1p, 2p, 3p sequence). So overall_min is 1.\n\nSo, the code should correctly compute this.\n\nBut wait, what about when the initial hand has some duplicates.\n\nFor example, initial hand is ['1m', '1m', '2m'].\n\nIn this case:\n\nFor triplet:\n\nLooking at 1m: count is 2 → required 1.\n\nFor 2m: count is 1 → required 2.\n\nOther tiles may require 3.\n\nSo triplet_min is 1.\n\nFor sequences:\n\nLooking for sequences in 'm' suit.\n\na=1: 1m, 2m, 3m.\n\nCheck if 3m is present: no. So required is 1 (since 3m is missing).\n\na=2: 2m,3m,4m → 2m is present, 3m and 4m are missing. So required is 2.\n\nThus, the minimal is 1 (either triplet or sequence). So overall_min is 1.\n\nWait, but in this case, the initial hand has two 1m's and one 2m. Adding one 3m would form a sequence (1,2,3) → but wait, do I have 1,2,3? Yes, but wait, the initial hand is 1m,1m,2m. So, after adding 3m, the hand becomes four tiles: 1m,1m,2m,3m. Then, the sequence is 1m,2m,3m → yes.\n\nSo the required is 1.\n\nBut what about the triplet: adding one 1m would make three 1m's. So, required is 1 as well.\n\nSo both options give required 1.\n\nSo, the code correctly finds the minimal.\n\nAnother test case: initial hand is ['1m', '1m', '1m'].\n\nTriplet_min is 0.\n\nSequence_min: for each possible sequence, how many are needed.\n\nFor a=1: 1m,2m,3m. We have 1m, but 2m and 3m are missing. So required is 2.\n\nSo, the minimal is 0.\n\nAnother test case: initial hand is ['1m', '2m', '3m'].\n\nTriplet_min is 3 (since none have 3 copies).\n\nSequence_min is 0.\n\nSo overall_min is 0.\n\nSo, code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, what about the case where the initial hand is empty except for one tile.\n\nWait, no, each initial hand is three tiles.\n\nWait, no, initial hand is three tiles.\n\nSo, for example, initial hand is ['1m', '2m', '4m'].\n\nFor sequences:\n\nCheck in 'm' suit:\n\na=1: 1,2,3 → 3m is missing → required 1.\n\na=2: 2,3,4 → 3m is missing → required 1.\n\na=3: 3,4,5 → 3m and 4m (if present) etc. So, for a=3, 3m is not present, 4m is present → required is 1 (since 3m is missing).\n\na=4: 4,5,6 → 4m is present, others missing → required 2.\n\nSo, the minimal for sequences is 1.\n\nFor triplets: for '1m', count is 1 → required 2.\n\nFor '2m', count is 1 → required 2.\n\nFor '4m', count is 1 → required 2.\n\nOther tiles require 3.\n\nSo, triplet_min is 2.\n\nSo, overall_min is min(2,1) =1.\n\nSo, adding 3m allows a sequence.\n\nSo, correct.\n\nNow, what about the initial hand has some tiles, but forming a sequence requires less tiles than any triplet.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Python.\n\nImplementing the triplet and sequence checks.\n\nFor each initial_hand in tiles:\n\nfrequency = defaultdict(int)\nfor tile in initial_hand:\n    frequency[tile] +=1\n\nCompute triplet_min:\n\ntriplet_min = min( max(3 - cnt, 0) for cnt in frequency.values() )\n\nWait, no. Because for each tile, the required is 3 - cnt, but we have to check all 27 possible tiles, including those not present in the initial hand.\n\nWait, no: because for a tile not present in the initial hand, its count is zero, so 3 - 0 =3. So, in the min computation, it's included.\n\nWait, but for the triplet_min, we have to consider all possible tiles, not just those present in the initial hand.\n\nBecause for example, the initial hand has no tiles from a certain suit, so the minimal required to form a triplet in that suit is 3.\n\nSo, for triplet_min, the code should loop through all 27 possible tiles, compute 3 - count for each, and find the minimal.\n\nSo, code:\n\ntriplet_min = float('inf')\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for num in range(1, 10):\n        tile = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n        current_count = frequency.get(tile, 0)\n        required = max(3 - current_count, 0)\n        if required < triplet_min:\n            triplet_min = required\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, for sequences:\n\nsequence_min = float('inf')\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for a in range(1, 8):\n        # generate the three tiles in the sequence\n        tiles_in_seq = [f\"{a}{suit}\", f\"{a+1}{suit}\", f\"{a+2}{suit}\"]\n        required = 0\n        for t in tiles_in_seq:\n            if frequency.get(t, 0) == 0:\n                required +=1\n        if required < sequence_min:\n            sequence_min = required\n\nWait, but what if the initial hand has multiple copies of a tile in the sequence? Like, the initial hand has two 2m's, and the sequence is 1m,2m,3m. Then, required is 1 for 1m and 3m, but since 2m is present once, that's okay. So, required is 2.\n\nWait, no. Because in the sequence, you only need one of each tile. So, if the initial hand has two 2m's, that's sufficient for the sequence. So, the required is 0 for 2m.\n\nSo, the code correctly adds 0 for tiles that are present.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor each tile in the sequence:\n\n   if frequency.get(t, 0) >=1 → no required.\n\n   else → required +=1.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nOnce triplet_min and sequence_min are computed, the overall_min is min(triplet_min, sequence_min).\n\nBut wait, what if triplet_min is higher than sequence_min, but the overall_min could be lower.\n\nNo, because we take the minimal of both.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nFirst initial hand: ['1s', '2s', '3s']\n\nfrequency: {'1s':1, '2s':1, '3s':1}\n\ntriplet_min: for each tile:\n\n1s: 3-1=2 → but wait, no: triplet requires three same tiles. So for 1s, required is 2.\n\nSimilarly for 2s and 3s. All other tiles have 0 count, requiring 3.\n\nSo triplet_min is 2.\n\nsequence_min: for 's' suit, a ranges from 1 to 7.\n\na=1: 1s,2s,3s → all present → required 0.\n\nSo sequence_min is 0.\n\nSo overall_min is 0.\n\nSecond initial hand: ['9m','9m','9m']\n\ntriplet_min: 0.\n\nsequence_min: for 'm' suit, a can be 1-7.\n\nFor a=7: 7m,8m,9m. 9m is present, others are missing → required 2.\n\nSo sequence_min is 2.\n\nOverall_min is 0.\n\nThird initial hand: ['3p', '9m', '2p']\n\nfrequency: {'3p':1, '9m':1, '2p':1}\n\ntriplet_min: for each tile, required is 2.\n\nFor 3p, 9m, 2p.\n\nOther tiles have 0, so required 3.\n\nSo triplet_min is 2.\n\nsequence_min: for 'p' suit, a can be 1-7.\n\na=1: 1p,2p,3p → 2p and 3p present, 1p missing → required 1.\n\na=2: 2p,3p,4p → 2p and 3p present, 4p missing → required 1.\n\na=3: 3p,4p,5p → 3p present, others missing → required 2.\n\nSo sequence_min is 1.\n\nOverall_min is min(2,1)=1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nNow, handling the output.\n\nThe output is three integers, each corresponding to the initial hand's minimal required.\n\nSo, for each initial hand, compute the minimal and print.\n\nIn code:\n\nfor initial_hand in tiles:\n    # compute as above\n    print(str(overall_min))\n\nWait, but the initial hand is read as a list of three strings, each is a tile.\n\nWait, for example, the third initial hand is ['3p', '9m', '2p'].\n\nBut when reading the input, the code splits each line into parts. For example, the third line is '3p 9m 2p' → split into ['3p', '9m', '2p'].\n\nSo, the code correctly processes each initial hand.\n\nPotential corner cases:\n\nCase 1: All three tiles are the same → triplet requires 0.\n\nCase 2: All three tiles are part of a sequence → sequence requires 0.\n\nCase 3: Two tiles form a sequence, but third is irrelevant. For example, ['1m', '2m', '5m'].\n\nThen, the sequence 1m,2m,3m requires 1 tile (3m). Triplet requires 2 for 1m, 2m, etc. So overall_min is 1.\n\nAnother case: initial hand is ['1m', '1m', '2m'].\n\nAs discussed earlier, triplet requires 1 (for 1m), sequence requires 1 (for 3m). So overall_min is 1.\n\nAnother edge case: the initial hand has a triplet but also has the possibility of a sequence that requires fewer tiles.\n\nFor example, initial hand is ['1m', '1m', '2m'].\n\nTriplet requires 1 (for 1m).\n\nSequence 1m,2m,3m requires 1 (3m).\n\nSo, minimal is 1.\n\nBut what if initial hand is ['1m','1m','3m'].\n\nThen, triplet requires 1 (1m).\n\nSequence 1m,2m,3m requires 1 (2m).\n\nSo, minimal is 1.\n\nAnother case: initial hand is ['1m', '2m', '4m'].\n\nTriplet requires 2 (for 1m, 2m, 4m).\n\nSequence 1m,2m,3m requires 1 (3m).\n\nSequence 2m,3m,4m requires 1 (3m).\n\nSo, minimal is 1.\n\nSo, the code handles all these cases.\n\nNow, code-wise, handling the initial hand as a list of three strings.\n\nWait, no, in the code, for each initial_hand in tiles, it's a list of three strings.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in Python, using f-strings for generating the tiles.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nRead the three lines:\n\ntiles = []\nfor _ in range(3):\n    line = input().strip()\n    tiles.append(line.split())\n\nThen, for each initial_hand in tiles:\n\ncompute frequency, triplet_min, sequence_min, overall_min.\n\nThen, print(overall_min).\n\nWait, but for each initial_hand, the code is:\n\nfrequency = {}\nfor tile in initial_hand:\n    frequency[tile] = frequency.get(tile, 0) + 1\n\nBut, in Python, the order of tiles is not important for the frequency count.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n\nSo, the full code is:\n\nRead the input as three lines, split into three parts each.\n\nFor each initial_hand in the three:\n\n   compute frequency.\n\n   compute triplet_min by checking all 27 possible tiles.\n\n   compute sequence_min by checking all possible sequences.\n\n   overall_min = min(triplet_min, sequence_min)\n\n   print(overall_min)\n\nWait, but for the output, we need to print three separate lines, each being the minimal for each initial hand.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor initial_hand in tiles:\n    # process\n    print(overall_min)\n\nBut, for each initial_hand, after processing, output the minimal.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) from her current hand of three tiles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: A mentsu can be either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit). The goal is to find the minimum number of additional tiles required to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each initial set of three tiles, we need to check all possible triplets and sequences. For each possible triplet, we calculate how many more tiles are needed to complete it. Similarly, for each possible sequence, we calculate how many more tiles are needed. The minimum number of tiles needed across all possible triplets and sequences is the answer for that initial set.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - For each initial set of three tiles, create a frequency dictionary to count occurrences of each tile.\n   - Check all possible triplets by iterating through each possible tile type (27 possibilities: 9 numbers × 3 suits).\n   - Check all possible sequences by iterating through each possible starting number (1 to 7) for each suit.\n   - Compute the minimum number of tiles needed to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently checks all possible triplets and sequences, ensuring that we find the optimal solution without excessive computational overhead.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ntiles = []\nfor _ in range(3):\n    line = input().strip()\n    tiles.append(line.split())\n\ndef compute_min(tiles_initial):\n    frequency = {}\n    for tile in tiles_initial:\n        frequency[tile] = frequency.get(tile, 0) + 1\n\n    # Calculate triplet minimal\n    triplet_min = float('inf')\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        for num in range(1, 10):\n            tile = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n            current_count = frequency.get(tile, 0)\n            required = max(3 - current_count, 0)\n            if required < triplet_min:\n                triplet_min = required\n\n    # Calculate sequence minimal\n    sequence_min = float('inf')\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        for a in range(1, 8):  # a ranges from 1 to 7 inclusive\n            seq = [f\"{a}{suit}\", f\"{a+1}{suit}\", f\"{a+2}{suit}\"]\n            required = 0\n            for t in seq:\n                if frequency.get(t, 0) == 0:\n                    required += 1\n            if required < sequence_min:\n                sequence_min = required\n\n    overall_min = min(triplet_min, sequence_min)\n    return overall_min\n\n# Process each initial hand and print the result\nfor initial_hand in tiles:\n    print(compute_min(initial_hand))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of three lines, each representing a tile in Tokitsukaze's hand. These are read and split into individual tiles.\n- **Frequency Dictionary**: For each initial hand, a frequency dictionary is created to count occurrences of each tile.\n- **Triplet Check**: For each possible tile type, the number of tiles needed to form a triplet is calculated. The minimum number across all tiles is recorded.\n- **Sequence Check**: For each possible sequence (each starting number from 1 to 7 in each suit), the number of tiles needed is calculated. The minimum number across all sequences is recorded.\n- **Result Calculation**: The minimum number of tiles needed from either a triplet or a sequence is determined and printed for each initial hand.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal solution by considering all possible ways to form a mentsu with the fewest additional tiles.",
