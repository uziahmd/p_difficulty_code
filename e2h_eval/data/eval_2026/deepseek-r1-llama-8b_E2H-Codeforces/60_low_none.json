Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the number of valid Morse code substrings after each step of building a string S. Hmm, let's try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that each Morse code letter is represented by a string of 1-4 characters, consisting of 0s and 1s. But not all possible combinations are valid. There are four invalid ones: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So any substring in S that corresponds exactly to one of these four strings isn't counted as a valid English letter.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that each modification appends a character (0 or 1) to S. After each modification, we need to find the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of S. So each such substring must translate into a valid English letter. The count is the total number of distinct substrings that correspond to a valid Morse code letter.\n\nBut how do I model this? It feels like a dynamic programming problem where I track the current state of the string and for each new character, update the possible valid substrings.\n\nLet me think about the approach. For each position in the string, I can keep track of the possible prefixes that form a valid Morse code substring. For example, if the current character makes a certain prefix valid, I add to the count.\n\nSo maybe I should use a DP array where dp[i] represents the number of valid substrings ending at position i. Then, for each new character, I look back to see what possible extensions could form a valid Morse code.\n\nWait, but Morse code letters can be of length 1, 2, 3, or 4. So for each position, I need to check the last 1, 2, 3, 4 characters to see if they form a valid Morse code string. But wait, checking all possible lengths each time might be too slow, especially since m can be up to 3000.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better way is to represent the current state based on the last few characters. Since the maximum length of a Morse code letter is 4, I can track the last 3 characters when a new one is added. Because any new substring ending at the current position can be up to 4 characters long.\n\nWait, yes. So for each new character, I'll consider all possible substrings ending at this position with lengths 1, 2, 3, 4. But since the maximum is 4, I only need to look back up to 3 previous characters.\n\nSo here's an idea: maintain a DP table where dp[i] represents the number of valid substrings ending at position i. When adding a new character c, I can compute dp_new as follows:\n\nFor each k in 1..4:\n   if k == 1: check if c alone is a valid Morse code.\n   else: check if the last k characters form a valid Morse code.\n   if any of these checks pass, add the corresponding counts.\n\nBut how do I efficiently check if a substring is a valid Morse code?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps precompute all possible valid Morse code strings. There are 26 letters, each with their own Morse code. But wait, the problem says that there are 30 possible strings of 1-4 bits, but 4 of them are invalid. So the valid ones are 26 in number. So the set of valid Morse codes is known.\n\nSo perhaps, precompute all valid Morse codes, store them in a set. Then, for each new character, check all possible substrings ending at that position of lengths 1, 2, 3, 4, and see if they are in this set.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute all valid Morse codes. Let's create a set called valid_codes containing all the 26 valid Morse code representations.\n\nWait, but according to the note, the four invalid codes are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". So the valid ones are the remaining 26.\n\nSo, first, I need to generate all possible 4-length binary strings (since each Morse code is up to 4 in length), except those four.\n\nWait, but wait: each Morse code is a sequence of dots and dashes, which are 0 and 1 respectively. So, for each possible length from 1 to 4, the number of possible strings is 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 30. But four of these are invalid, so 26 are valid.\n\nSo I can generate all these 26 valid codes and store them in a set.\n\nSo first step is to create this set.\n\nOnce that's done, for each step, when a new character is added, I check all possible substrings ending at this position (of lengths ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of a given string S after each modification. Each character in S is either a dot (0) or a dash (1), and we need to count valid Morse code substrings after each addition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Valid Morse Codes**: First, generate all valid Morse code strings of lengths 1 to 4, excluding the four invalid codes (\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"). These valid codes correspond to the 26 English letters.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: Use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid Morse code substrings ending at position `i`.\n3. **Track Substrings**: For each new character added to the string, check all possible substrings ending at this character with lengths 1, 2, 3, and 4. If any of these substrings are valid Morse codes, update the DP array accordingly.\n4. **Efficient Checking**: Maintain a rolling window of the last 3 characters to efficiently check if the current substring is a valid Morse code.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\nvalid_codes = {\n    '0000', '0001', '0010', '0100',\n    '0101', '0110', '1000', '1001',\n    '1010', '1011', '1100', '1101',\n    '1110', '1111'  # Wait, no, wait: the four invalid ones are excluded.\n    # So we need to actually create the correct set.\n}\n\n# Generate all possible 1-4 length binary strings except the invalid ones\nvalid = set()\nfor l in range(1, 5):\n    for s in itertools.product('01', repeat=l):\n        s = ''.join(s)\n        if s not in {'0011', '0101', '1110', '1111'}:\n            valid.add(s)\n\nvalid = list(valid)\nm = int(input())\ncurrent_str = []\nresult = []\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    c = input().strip()\n    current_str.append(c)\n    n = len(current_str)\n    dp_new = 0\n    for k in range(1, 5):\n        if n < k:\n            continue\n        substr = ''.join(current_str[-k:])\n        if substr in valid:\n            dp_new += 1\n    total = (sum(result) + dp_new) % MOD\n    result.append(total)\n\nfor res in result:\n    print(res)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Valid Morse Codes**: We generate all possible binary strings of lengths 1 to 4 and exclude the four invalid codes. This gives us a set of valid Morse codes.\n2. **Dynamic Programming**: For each new character, we check all possible substrings ending at this character (of lengths 1 to 4). If a substring is valid, we increment the count.\n3. **Efficiency**: By maintaining only the last 3 characters, we efficiently check substrings without redundant computations, ensuring the solution runs in linear time relative to the input size.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count valid Morse code substrings after each modification, providing the required results modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).",
