The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this Rock-Paper-Scissors problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that Nikephoros and Polycarpus are playing n rounds of rock-paper-scissors. In each round, they choose their move from their respective sequences A and B, cycling through them. If one wins, the loser gets a red spot. We need to count how many red spots each has after n rounds.\n\nHmm, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the input gives n, then two strings A and B. Each character is 'R', 'S', or 'P'. For each of the n rounds, we determine who wins based on their current choices. Then, increment the corresponding counter.\n\nWait, but how do we get their choices for each round? Because the sequences are cycled. So for each i-th round, the choice for Nikephoros is A[i % m], and similarly for Polycarpus it's B[i % k].\n\nSo for each round from 0 to n-1, calculate the moves and determine the winner.\n\nNow, the key is to compute for each round whether Nikephoros wins, loses, or it's a draw. But wait, no: because in each round, the winner is determined by the rules. The loser gets a red spot. So if it's a draw, nobody gets a spot.\n\nWait no, the note says: if the round ends in a draw, nothing happens. So only when someone wins, the other gets a spot.\n\nSo for each round, I need to:\n\n1. Get the move for N (A[i % m]) and P (B[i % k]).\n2. Determine who wins.\n3. If N wins, P gets a spot.\n4. If P wins, N gets a spot.\n5. Else, no spots.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Initialize two counters, count_N and count_P, to 0.\n- For each round from 0 to n-1:\n   - Get the move for N: a = A[round % len(A)]\n   - Get the move for P: b = B[round % len(B)]\n   - Determine the winner between a and b.\n   - Update the counters accordingly.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2e5, which is manageable because even with 2e5 iterations, each iteration is O(1), so it's acceptable.\n\nSo the main part is determining the outcome of each round.\n\nHow to determine the winner between a and b?\n\nLet me think about the rules:\n\n- Rock beats scissors.\n- Scissors beat paper.\n- Paper beats rock.\n\nSo for given a and b, we can represent the possible outcomes.\n\nLet me create a helper function to determine the winner between two moves.\n\nFor example, if a is 'R' and b is 'S', then R beats S, so N wins and P gets a spot.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the loser gets pinched. So when N's move beats P's, N wins, P loses. So P gets a spot.\n\nSimilarly, if P's move beats N's, then N loses, gets a spot.\n\nElse, it's a draw.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each round:\n\na = A[round % m]\nb = B[round % k]\n\nif a beats b:\n   P's spot += 1\nelif b beats a:\n   N's spot +=1\nelse:\n   do nothing\n\nSo now, the question is, how to implement the 'beats' condition.\n\nI can represent the beats as a dictionary or a function.\n\nAlternative approach: for each possible pair (a, b), determine the result.\n\nLet me list all possibilities:\n\nIf a is 'R':\n   beats 'S'\nIf a is 'S':\n   beats 'P'\nIf a is 'P':\n   beats 'R'\n\nSo for a given a and b, we can check:\n\nif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') → a wins.\nif (a == 'S' and b == 'P') → a wins.\nif (a == 'P' and b == 'R') → a wins.\n\nElse, check if b is winning. That is:\n\nif (b == 'R' and a == 'S') → b wins.\nif (b == 'S' and a == 'P') → b wins.\nif (b == 'P' and a == 'R') → b wins.\n\nElse, it's a draw.\n\nSo in code, perhaps something like:\n\ndef get_winner(a, b):\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        return 1 # N wins\n    elif (b == 'R' and a == 'S') or (b == 'S' and a == 'P",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they have played a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors. Each round is played according to predefined sequences for each player, and the loser of each round gets a red spot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game rules are straightforward:\n   - Rock beats scissors.\n   - Scissors beat paper.\n   - Paper beats rock.\n   - If both players choose the same move, the round results in a draw with no red spots.\n\n2. **Cyclic Moves**: Each player has a sequence of moves that they cycle through for each round. For example, if Player A's sequence is \"RPS\" and Player B's sequence is \"RSPP\", Player A will play 'R' in the first round, 'P' in the second, 'S' in the third, and then repeat from 'R' again.\n\n3. **Determine Winners**: For each round, we compare the moves of both players to determine the winner. The loser of each round gets a red spot.\n\n4. **Efficiency Considerations**: Given the constraints (up to 200,000 rounds), we need an efficient solution. By iterating through each round and using simple conditional checks, we can determine the outcome efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\ncount_N = 0\ncount_P = 0\n\nfor round in range(n):\n    a = A[round % len(A)]\n    b = B[round % len(B)]\n    \n    # Check if N wins\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        count_P += 1\n    elif (b == 'R' and a == 'S') or (b == 'S' and a == 'P') or (b == 'P' and a == 'R'):\n        count_N += 1\n\nprint(count_N, count_P)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: Read the number of rounds and the sequences for both players.\n- **Loop Through Rounds**: For each round, determine the move for both players based on their sequences.\n- **Determine Outcome**: Check if Player A's move beats Player B's move. If so, increment Player B's red spot count. Otherwise, check if Player B's move beats Player A's move and increment Player A's red spot count if true.\n- **Output Results**: After processing all rounds, print the counts of red spots for both players.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the outcome of each round and update the red spot counts accordingly, providing the correct result within the problem constraints.",
