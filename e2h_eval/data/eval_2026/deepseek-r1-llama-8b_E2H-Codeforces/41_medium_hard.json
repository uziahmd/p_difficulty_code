There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck but let's try to think through it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on a street with certain spots. Each spot can have a house of height between 0 and h. Each house contributes a squared value to the profit. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in a certain range [l_i, r_i], the tallest house must be at most x_i. My goal is to maximize the total profit by choosing the heights optimally.\n\nHmm. So, how do I model this? It feels like an optimization problem with constraints. The variables are the heights of each spot, and the constraints are the m restrictions.\n\nWait, but with n up to 50, maybe a dynamic programming approach is feasible. Because 50 is manageable for certain DP solutions.\n\nLet me think about the possible states. Maybe for each position i, I can track the maximum possible height given the constraints up to that point. But how?\n\nAlternatively, I can model this as intervals and find for each interval what's the minimum allowed maximum height. Wait, but overlapping intervals complicate things because a spot might be covered by multiple restrictions. For example, a spot could be in two different restrictions, each imposing their own maximum. So, the height for that spot must be the minimum of all those maximums.\n\nSo, perhaps for each spot, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of all x_i where l_i ≤ i ≤ r_i. Additionally, each spot's height cannot exceed h.\n\nWait, yes! Because for a particular spot i, any restriction that includes i will impose that the height at i must be ≤ x_i. So the maximum possible height for spot i is the minimum of all x_i across all restrictions that cover i, but also not exceeding h.\n\nWait, no. Because if a spot is covered by multiple restrictions, say, two restrictions: one says max 5, another says max 3. Then the spot's height must be at most 3 because that's the stricter condition.\n\nSo, for each spot i, we can precompute the maximum allowed height as the minimum of all x_j where l_j ≤ i ≤ r_j, plus considering h. Because even if a spot isn't covered by any restriction, its maximum is h.\n\nSo, for each spot i, the maximum possible height is min(h, min{x_i for all restrictions covering i}).\n\nOnce I have this maximum for each spot, the optimal choice is to set each spot's height to this maximum, right? Because higher is better since the square is larger. So to maximize the sum of squares, each spot should be as high as possible within their constraints.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because for each spot, the square function is increasing with the height. So to maximize the sum, each spot should take the highest possible allowed value.\n\nBut wait, the initial thought was that the maximum allowed for each spot is determined by the intersection of all applicable restrictions. So the process is:\n\n1. For each spot i from 1 to n:\n   a. Find all restrictions that include i in their [l, r] range.\n   b. Take the minimum x_i among these restrictions.\n   c. The maximum height allowed for spot i is the minimum between h and this value.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, once I have for each spot the maximum allowed height, the optimal choice is to set each spot to that height. Then, the profit is just the sum of squares of these heights.\n\nBut wait, is that always the case? What if some constraints overlap in such a way that setting a spot to its maximum affects other spots?\n\nHmm, for example, imagine two restrictions that both cover spot 2. One says x=5, another x=3. Then, spot 2's maximum is 3. But what if another restriction covers spots 2-4 with x=4. Then, spot 2's maximum is min(3,4) =3, spot 3 is min of all x's for its restrictions, etc.\n\nIn this case, the initial approach of calculating for each spot the maximum allowed height correctly captures all constraints, and setting each spot to that height gives the maximum profit.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each spot i (from 1 to n), compute the maximum allowed height as the minimum of all x_j for restrictions that include i, and then take the minimum with h.\n\n2. Once all spots' heights are determined, calculate the sum of squares.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read n, h, m.\n- Read m restrictions, each as l_i, r_i, x_i.\n- For each spot i (from 1 to n), collect all x's from restrictions where l_i <= i <= r_i.\n- For each i, the maximum allowed is min of those x's, but not more than h.\n- Sum the squares of these values.\n\nWait, but is this approach correct? Let's test it against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n1 1 1 → affects spot 1 only.\n2 2 3 → affects spot 2.\n3 3 2 → affects spot 3.\n\nFor spot 1: x is 1. So maximum is 1.\nSpot 2: x is 3. Max is 3.\nSpot 3: x is 2. Max is 2.\nSum is 1+9+4=14. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n2 3 8 → affects spots 2,3.\n3 4 7 → affects spots 3,4.\n\nSpot 1: no restrictions. So max is 10.\nSpot 2: min(8) → 8.\nSpot 3: min(8,7) →7.\nSpot4: min(7) →7.\nSum is 100 +64 +49 +49 = 262. Which matches.\n\nAnother test case: suppose a spot is covered by multiple restrictions with varying x's.\n\nE.g., spot 2 is covered by x=5 and x=3. Then, the maximum is 3.\n\nAnother example: n=2, m=2.\n\nRestriction 1: 1-2, x=4.\n\nRestriction 2: 1-2, x=5.\n\nThen, for spot 1, the maximum is min(4,5) =4.\n\nSpot 2: same as 4.\n\nSo each is set to 4.\n\nNow, what if another restriction covers spot 2 with x=3.\n\nThen, spot 2's maximum is min(4,3)=3.\n\nSo the approach seems to handle that.\n\nSo, the plan is to compute for each spot the minimum x across all applicable restrictions, then take the minimum with h.\n\nSo, the code would need to read all the restrictions, for each spot, collect all x's that apply, compute the min, then cap at h.\n\nBut wait, what if a spot is covered by multiple overlapping restrictions. For example, spot 3 is covered by two restrictions: one with x=5 and another with x=3. Then the min is 3.\n\nYes, the approach captures that.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize for each spot i, max_height[i] = h.\n\nFor each restriction l, r, x:\n\n   For each spot i from l to r:\n\n       current_max = min(current_max, x)\n\nWait, but that's O(m*n), which for n=50 and m=50 is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, for each spot, collect all x's that apply to it, then compute the min.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nCreate a list called max_allowed, size n+1 (since spots are 1-based). Initialize each element to h.\n\nThen, for each of the m restrictions:\n\n   l, r, x = input values.\n\n   for i in l to r:\n\n       if x < max_allowed[i]:\n\n           max_allowed[i] = x\n\nOnce all restrictions are processed, for each i, the max height is max_allowed[i].\n\nCompute the sum of squares.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the indices start from 1, right? So for i in l to r, inclusive.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, let's see the first sample:\n\nAfter processing first restriction (1,1,1):\n\nmax_allowed[1] becomes 1.\n\nThen, second restriction (2,2,3): max_allowed[2] becomes 3.\n\nThird (3,3,2): max_allowed[3] is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nIn the second sample:\n\nRestriction 2-3,8:\n\ni=2: max_allowed[2] is 8.\n\ni=3: max_allowed[3] is 8.\n\nRestriction 3-4,7:\n\ni=3: compare 8 and 7, so becomes 7.\n\ni=4: becomes 7.\n\nSo, for spot 1, remains 10.\n\nSo the code would correctly compute that.\n\nWhat about a spot covered by multiple restrictions, some with lower x?\n\nLike, suppose spot 2 is covered by x=5, x=3, x=4.\n\nThen during processing:\n\nInitially, max_allowed[2] is h.\n\nEach restriction is processed:\n\nFor x=5: since 5 < h, so max_allowed[2] becomes 5.\n\nx=3: 3 <5 → becomes 3.\n\nx=4: 4>3 → no change.\n\nSo final max_allowed[2] is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the approach is correct.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nmax_allowed = [h]*(n+1)\n\nfor each of m restrictions:\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    for i in range(l, r+1):\n\n        if x < max_allowed[i]:\n\n            max_allowed[i] = x\n\nsum_squares = sum( a*a for a in max_allowed[1:n+1] )\n\nprint(sum_squares)\n\nWait, but what if h is 0? Or x is zero?\n\nIt's handled automatically, since the code takes min(x, h) by comparing x to the current max_allowed[i]. If x is less than current, which could be h, then it gets updated.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial max_allowed[i] is h. Then, for each restriction, if x is less than the current value, it is set to x.\n\nSo for example, if h is 5, and a restriction has x=3, then the spot's height becomes 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWhat if a spot is covered by multiple restrictions with x=3 and x=2. The code correctly sets it to 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, this seems to handle all cases.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1 1 1 → i=1: x=1 <3 → set to 1.\n\n2 2 3 → i=2: 3<3? No, so no change. So remains 3.\n\n3 3 2 → i=3: 2<3 → set to 2.\n\nSo, the heights are 1,3,2. Sum is 1+9+4=14.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestriction 2-3,8:\n\ni=2: 8<10 → set to 8.\n\ni=3: 8<10 → set to8.\n\nRestriction 3-4,7:\n\ni=3: 7<8 → set to7.\n\ni=4: 7<10 → set to7.\n\nSo, spot 1:10, spots 2:8, 3:7, 4:7.\n\nSum is 100+64+49+49=262.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nWait, but what about when a restriction has x greater than h? For example, h=3 and a restriction x=5. Then, for the spots in that restriction, the x is 5, which is higher than h=3. So, in that case, the max_allowed[i] remains 3.\n\nBecause when you process the restriction, x=5 is compared to the current max_allowed[i], which is 3. Since 5>3, the condition x < current is false. So, no change.\n\nWhich is correct, because the maximum allowed is h, regardless of the restriction's x.\n\nSo, the code correctly ignores any restrictions that have x higher than h, as they don't affect the max allowed.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should work for all cases.\n\nI think that's the solution. So, the Python code can be written as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit possible from building houses on a street with given constraints. Each house contributes to the profit based on its height squared, and there are specific height restrictions for certain ranges of spots.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to build houses on each spot such that their heights do not exceed the given restrictions. The goal is to maximize the total profit from these houses.\n2. **Constraints Handling**: For each spot, the height must be within the maximum allowed by all applicable restrictions. This means each spot's height is constrained by the minimum value of the restrictions covering that spot.\n3. **Initialization**: Start by assuming the maximum possible height for each spot as the global maximum height `h`.\n4. **Apply Restrictions**: For each restriction, update the maximum allowed height for each spot within the restriction's range if the restriction's height is lower than the current maximum allowed height.\n5. **Calculate Profit**: Once all restrictions are applied, compute the profit by summing the squares of the maximum allowed heights for each spot.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nmax_heights = [h] * (n + 1)  # 1-based indexing\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    for i in range(l, r + 1):\n        if x < max_heights[i]:\n            max_heights[i] = x\n\ntotal = sum(a * a for a in max_heights[1:n+1])\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of spots `n`, the maximum height `h`, and the number of restrictions `m`.\n- **Max Height Initialization**: An array `max_heights` is initialized with `h` for each spot, assuming no restrictions.\n- **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, the code updates the maximum allowed height for each spot in the restriction's range if the restriction's height is lower than the current maximum allowed height.\n- **Profit Calculation**: The total profit is calculated by summing the squares of the maximum allowed heights for each spot.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are respected while maximizing the profit from the houses built on the street. The solution efficiently handles the constraints and computes the result in linear time relative to the number of spots and restrictions, making it suitable for the given problem constraints.",
