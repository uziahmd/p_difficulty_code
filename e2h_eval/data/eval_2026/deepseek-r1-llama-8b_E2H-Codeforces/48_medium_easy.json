He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to convert a number from base a to base b, but with a twist. The third part of the door's lock has a Roman numeral representation if the second part is R. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem says that each door has four parts: a, which is an integer; the second part is either a number b or an R, indicating that the second part is in Roman numerals. Oh right, so when converting, we have to handle both cases where the second part is a regular integer (like base conversion) or a Roman numeral, which requires us to interpret it differently.\n\nSo, the input will be a line with two numbers a and b, followed by a line containing a string c in base a. But wait, no—the second part is either a number or R. So the first line is a and b, and the second line is c, which is a string representing a number in base a. Wait, no, the second line is a single non-negative integer c in base a, possibly with leading zeros.\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem statement. Oh right, the second part of the door is either b or R. So the first line has a and b. Then the second line is the c in base a, but the way to open the door depends on whether the second part is b or R.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is: Each door is a combination of a, then the second part is either b or R, then c, then nothing. So for example, if the second part is R, then the door's number is represented as a Roman numeral in base a, which needs to be written in base b.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe door has four parts. The first is a, the second is either b or R, the third is c, and the fourth is empty. So when you open the door, you take the first part (a), then the second part (b or R), then the third part (c), and then write the result in base b. Or something like that.\n\nWait, the explanation says: c is an integer written in base a, and to open the door, we should write it in base b. But when the second part is R, it's a special case because the R represents some Roman numeral system.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is:\n\n- The door's number is a four-part code: [a][part2][c][empty].\n\nWhen part2 is 'R', then the number is the value of part2 (which is a Roman numeral) interpreted in base a. Then, the total number is that value multiplied by 10^k, where k is the length of c, plus the value of c in base a?\n\nNo, that can't be right. Because the problem says that when the second part is R, the c is written in base a, but we have to convert that into Roman numerals according to the rules, and then write that in base b.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the note in the problem again.\n\nIt says that the number is written in base a as c, but when the second part is R, it's converted to a Roman numeral in base a, and then that is written in base b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process is:\n\nIf the second part is R, then the number is the Roman numeral representation of the integer c (in base a). Then, we write that Roman numeral in base b.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem statement says:\n\nEach door has four parts. The first is a, the second is either b or R, the third is c, and the fourth is empty.\n\nTo open the door, we need to compute a number based on these parts and then write it in base b.\n\nBut how?\n\nThe explanation says: c is an integer written in base a. To open the door, we should write it in base b. But when the second part is R, it's not just a piece of cake because the R is a special numbering system used by the Romans.\n\nSo perhaps the process is:\n\n1. Compute the value of c in base a, call it val.\n2. If the second part is R, then val is converted to a Roman numeral according to Roman rules. Otherwise, it's treated as a base a number, and we convert it to base b.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem to fit the sample input. Let's look at the sample input and output.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nWait, looking at the first case:\n\nInput line is '10 2\\n1' — so a=10, b=2, and c is '1' in base 10.\n\nSo the number is 1 in base 10. Since the second part is 2, which is not R, so we convert 1 from base 10 to base 2, which is '1'.\n\nSecond case: '16 R\\n5' — a=16, b=R, c='5'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first line is '10 2', the second is '16 R' — no, wait, no, the first line is a and b, the second line is c.\n\nWait, no, in the sample input, it's given as ['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', ...]. So the first line is '10 2\\n1' — perhaps it's the first test case.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is a list of multiple test cases. So each element in the list is a separate test case, consisting of a line for a and b, then a line for c.\n\nSo for each test case:\n\n- Read a and b.\n- Read c, which is a string in base a.\n\nThen, determine what to do with the second part of the door (part2):\n\nIf part2 is 'R', then we need to convert the value of c in base a into a Roman numeral, then represent that Roman numeral in base b.\n\nOtherwise, part2 is a number, which is b, so we just convert c from base a to base b.\n\nWait, that makes sense.\n\nSo for each test case:\n\nCase 1:\n\na=10, b=2.\n\nc is '1' in base 10.\n\nSince part2 is '2' (not R), so we convert c from base a (10) to base b (2).\n\n1 in base 10 is 1 in base 2, which is '1'.\n\nOutput is '1'.\n\nCase 2:\n\na=16, b is 'R'.\n\nc is '5' in base 16 (hex).\n\nSince part2 is 'R', we need to treat the value of c as a number, convert it to Roman numerals, and then write that Roman numeral in base b.\n\nWait, but wait: when part2 is R, the value of c is in base a. We convert that integer to Roman numerals, then express that Roman numeral in base b.\n\nWait, no. When part2 is R, the process is:\n\n1. Convert c from base a to a decimal integer (val).\n2. Convert val to a Roman numeral string according to the rules.\n3. Then, treat that Roman numeral string as a number in base b, but wait—no, that's not right. Because Roman numerals are base 10, but the problem says to write the Roman numeral in base b.\n\nWait, I'm confused. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nWhen the second part is R, we should write it in base b. So, the c is in base a, which is converted to a Roman numeral, and then that Roman numeral is written in base b.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's more precise: the value of c in base a is converted into a Roman numeral, which is then written in base b.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\n- The second part is R, meaning that the value of c in base a is converted into a Roman numeral. Then, that Roman numeral is written as a number in base b. But Roman numerals are base 10, so how to represent them in another base?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when part2 is R, the value of c is treated as a Roman numeral in base a, but that doesn't make sense because Roman numerals are base 10.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nLet me think about the problem differently.\n\nThe door's number is made up of four parts: a, part2, c, and nothing. So when part2 is R, the number is computed as (value of part2 in its own way) * (10^len(c)) + (value of c in base a).\n\nWait, but part2 when it's R is a Roman numeral, but how is it interpreted? Like, for example, in the second test case of the sample input:\n\nTest case 2:\n\na=16, b=R.\n\nc=5 (in base 16, which is 5 in decimal).\n\nPart2 is R, so the number is the value of R in its own system (but R isn't a number, perhaps it's the Roman numeral for 5? Or perhaps it's the Roman numeral representation of the value of c in base a.\n\nWait, perhaps the way it works is:\n\nIf part2 is R, then the number is the value of c in base a, converted into Roman numerals, and then that Roman numeral is written in base b.\n\nSo:\n\nnumber = roman_val\n\nThen, output that Roman numeral as a number in base b.\n\nWait, but Roman numerals are in base 10, so writing them in base b would involve breaking down their digits into base b.\n\nWait, no. For example, in the sample input, the second test case:\n\na=16, b=R.\n\nc is 5 in hex (base 16) → decimal 5.\n\nPart2 is R, so we convert 5 to Roman numerals: V.\n\nThen, we write V in base R, which is base 18 (since R represents 18 in the letters beyond 10, like A=10, B=11, etc. So R is 18? Or is R a symbol?)\n\nWait, no, in the problem statement, it says that in bases greater than 10, we use A for 10, B for 11, etc. So the letters go from A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15, G=16, H=17, I=18, J=19, K=20, L=21, M=22, N=23, O=24, P=25, Q=26, R=27, S=28, T=29, U=30, V=31, W=32, X=33, Y=34, Z=35.\n\nSo when part2 is R, the base is 27? Or is it that R is treated as a digit in the Roman numeral, but that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps when part2 is R, the base is 10, but the letters in the Roman numeral are treated as their values.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me try to outline the steps:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Read a and b. Note that b can be 'R', which indicates that the second part is using Roman numerals.\n\n2. Read c, which is a string in base a.\n\n3. Compute the value of c in base a → val.\n\n4. If the second part is not R (i.e., it's a number):\n\n   - Convert val from base a to base b as a string, without leading zeros.\n\n5. Else (second part is R):\n\n   - Convert val into a Roman numeral string according to the rules.\n\n   - Then, treat this Roman numeral string as a number in base b, and output it.\n\nWait, that's a bit unclear. Let's see the sample test case 2.\n\nTest case 2:\n\na=16, b=R.\n\nc is '5' in base 16 → val is 5.\n\nSince part2 is R, we convert 5 into Roman numerals, which is 'V'.\n\nThen, we treat 'V' as a number in base R. But 'V' is a single character. In base R, 'V' would represent 5, but wait, in base R, the digits allowed are 0 to R-1. So 'V' in base R would be 5, but only if 5 < R.\n\nWait, but in the sample output, the result is 'V', which suggests that when part2 is R, we don't perform any further conversion. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when part2 is R, the entire number is represented as a Roman numeral, and that's the output in base b.\n\nWait, but that also doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when part2 is R, the number is simply the Roman numeral representation of val, and that's written in base b.\n\nWait, but in the sample test case 2, the output is 'V'. So if the Roman numeral is 'V' (which is 5), and the base is R (which is 18?), then 'V' in base 18 would be 5, but the output is 'V' as a string. So perhaps the output is directly the Roman numeral.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the second test case's output is 'V', which is the same as the Roman numeral.\n\nSo perhaps when part2 is R, the output is the Roman numeral representation of val, regardless of the base. So the base b is ignored in that case.\n\nThat seems possible. So perhaps the process is:\n\nIf the second part is R, then:\n\n- Convert c from base a to decimal (val).\n- Convert val to Roman numeral string.\n- Output that string.\n\nElse:\n\n- Convert c from base a to decimal (val).\n- Convert val to base b as a string, omitting leading zeros.\n\nWait, but in the sample test case 5, the input is '12 13\\nA', and the output is 'A'.\n\nSo a=12, b=13, c='A' in base 12.\n\nWait, 'A' in base 12 is 10 in decimal.\n\nSince part2 is 13, which is not R, so we convert 10 from base 12 to base 13.\n\nWait, 10 in base 12 is equal to 10 in decimal. Converting to base 13 would be 'A' (since 10 is less than 13). So the output is 'A'.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo that seems to fit.\n\nAnother sample case: the fourth test case is '2 2\\n1111001'. So a=2, b=2, c is '1111001' in base 2.\n\nSince part2 is 2, which is not R, so we convert '1111001' from base 2 to base 2, which is the same as the original. So output is '1111001'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: the third test case is '5 R\\n4'. So a=5, b=R, c is '4' in base 5, which is 4 in decimal.\n\nSince part2 is R, we convert 4 to Roman numeral, which is 'IV'.\n\nBut then, since part2 is R, the output is 'IV', regardless of base b.\n\nYes, the sample output is 'IV'.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n- For each test case:\n\n   - Read a, b.\n\n   - Read c, which is a string in base a.\n\n   - Compute val = c's value in base a.\n\n   - If part2 is R:\n\n      - Convert val to Roman numeral string.\n\n      - Output that string.\n\n   - Else:\n\n      - Convert val to base b as a string, omitting leading zeros.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to:\n\nImplementing a function to convert a number to Roman numerals, and a function to convert a number to a given base, handling up to base 36 (since letters go up to Z, which is 35).\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read a and b. Determine if part2 is R or not.\n\n2. Read c, parse it as a base a number, get val.\n\n3. If part2 is R:\n\n   a. Convert val to Roman numeral string.\n\n   b. Output the Roman string.\n\n4. Else:\n\n   a. Convert val to base b, as a string, without leading zeros.\n\n   b. Output that string.\n\nNow, the key steps are:\n\n- Parsing c correctly as a base a number.\n\n- Converting to Roman numerals.\n\n- Converting to another base.\n\nLet me think about the functions needed.\n\nFirst, parsing c in base a:\n\nWe can write a function that takes a string and a base, returns the integer value.\n\nThis is straightforward, but we need to handle leading zeros.\n\nBut the problem states that the output must not have leading zeros, but the input may have leading zeros.\n\nSo for the function, leading zeros are allowed in the input.\n\nNext, converting a number to Roman numerals.\n\nRoman numerals have specific patterns for certain values, including subtractive notation for 4 and 9, etc.\n\nI'll need to implement this function correctly.\n\nFinally, converting a decimal number to a given base, which can be up to 36, and return the string representation without leading zeros.\n\nLet's think about each part.\n\nParsing the number:\n\nImplement a function to convert a string in base a to a decimal integer.\n\nFor example, 'A' in base 12 is 10.\n\nWe can iterate through each character, multiply by a^position, etc.\n\nBut since a can be up to 25, the characters can be 0-9, then A-Z for higher digits.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, c is a non-negative integer in base a. So c can have letters, but only if a is larger than 10. For example, if a is 16, c can be 'A' which is 10.\n\nSo the parsing function needs to handle digits beyond 9 by mapping letters to their respective values.\n\nSo for a base a, each digit is:\n\ndigit_char -> value:\n\n0-9: 0-9.\n\nA-Z: 10-35.\n\nBut the base a can be up to 25, so for a=25, the maximum digit is 24 (since digits are 0-24). So letters beyond 25 won't be present.\n\nSo the function can map each character to its corresponding value.\n\nFor example, for a given a, and a character d, the value is:\n\nif d is a digit, int(d).\n\nelse, ord(d.upper()) - ord('A') + 10.\n\nBut we need to ensure that the character is a valid digit in base a.\n\nSo in the function, for each character in c:\n\n- Check if it's a valid digit in base a.\n\nOnce all characters are processed, sum the values.\n\nWait, but for example, c can be 'A' in base 16: which is 10.\n\nSo the function will correctly parse that.\n\nNow, the next part: converting a number to Roman numerals.\n\nRoman numerals have specific rules for each digit:\n\nNumbers from 0 to 3 are represented as additive: I, II, III.\n\n4 is IV (5-1), 5 is V, 6 VI, 7 VII, 8 VIII, 9 IX.\n\nFor numbers 10-19: X, XX, XXX, XL, L, LX, LXX, LXXX, XC.\n\n20-29: XX, XXX, XXXX, XL, L, LX, LXX, LXXX, XC.\n\n30-39: XXX, XXXX, XXXX, XL, L, LX, LXX, LXXX, XC.\n\n40-49: XL, L, LX, LXX, LXXX, XC, XL.\n\nWait, no, let's think again.\n\nThe Roman numerals are built in groups of thousands, but for our purposes, the number is up to around 300010, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the number after conversion is <= 101510, so the function can handle numbers up to that.\n\nThe standard approach is to create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the value and the corresponding Roman numeral string, in descending order of the value.\n\nFor example:\n\nvalues = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for each value in values, subtract as much as possible and append the corresponding string.\n\nSo for example, 3999 would be MMMCMXCIX.\n\nSo implementing this function is manageable.\n\nNow, for the third part: converting a decimal number to a given base, which can be up to 36.\n\nThe function will take a number and a base, and return the string representation in that base, without leading zeros.\n\nFor example, 10 in base 16 is 'A'.\n\nThe algorithm is:\n\nWhile n > 0:\n\n   remainder = n % base.\n\n   Append the corresponding character for the remainder.\n\n   n = n // base.\n\nBut the digits are added in reverse order, so we need to reverse the result at the end.\n\nEach remainder is mapped as follows:\n\nfor r in 0..35:\n\n   if r < 10: str(r)\n\n   else: chr(ord('A') + r - 10)\n\nBut for bases larger than 10, letters are used for digits beyond 9.\n\nSo for base 13, the digits are 0-12, with 10=A, 11=B, 12=C, etc.\n\nSo the function can handle this.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead each test case.\n\nFor each test case:\n\n   Read a and b.\n\n   Read c.\n\n   Compute val: the value of c in base a.\n\n   If part2 is R:\n\n      Convert val to Roman numeral string.\n\n      Output that string.\n\n   Else:\n\n      Convert val to base b, string representation.\n\n      Output that string.\n\nNow, implementing the helper functions.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the second test case is:\n\na=16, b=R.\n\nc is '5' in base 16 → val=5.\n\nSince part2 is R, output is the Roman numeral for 5, which is 'V'.\n\nIn the sample output, it's 'V'.\n\nAnother sample: third test case.\n\na=5, b=R.\n\nc is '4' in base5 → val=4.\n\nRoman numeral is 'IV'.\n\nOutput is 'IV'.\n\nAnother sample: fifth test case.\n\na=12, b=13.\n\nc is 'A' in base 12 → val=10.\n\nSince part2 is 13, convert 10 to base 13: 'A'.\n\nOutput is 'A'.\n\nSo the plan is correct.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as a list of lines, each representing a test case.\n\nBut in practice, the input is given via stdin, so the code should read all lines, split into test cases.\n\nBut perhaps for the code, it's better to read all lines at once.\n\nBut in the sample input, each test case is two lines: the first line is a and b, the second line is c.\n\nSo the code can read lines until EOF.\n\nBut perhaps for the code, it's easier to read all lines at once, split into tokens, and process them.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nIn the sample input, each test case is two lines:\n\nFirst line: a and b.\n\nSecond line: c.\n\nSo, the code can read all lines, process them in pairs.\n\nSo:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.rstrip('\\n') for line in sys.stdin]\n\ntest_cases = []\ni = 0\nwhile i < len(lines):\n    # Read a and b\n    ab_line = lines[i]\n    a, b = ab_line.split()\n    i += 1\n    # Read c\n    c_line = lines[i]\n    c = c_line\n    i += 1\n    test_cases.append( (a, b, c) )\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first line is '10 2\\n1', which is two parts after splitting: '10' and '2' (since \\n is stripped). So yes, this works.\n\nThen, for each test case, process as follows.\n\nNow, implement the helper functions.\n\nFunction to parse c in base a:\n\ndef from_base(s, base):\n    val = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            d = int(ch)\n        else:\n            d = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        val = val * base + d\n    return val\n\nBut wait, for a base a, the digits must be valid. So for example, in base 10, digits can't be letters. So in the function, for each character, check if it's a valid digit for the base.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is correct, so we don't need to handle invalid inputs.\n\nSo the function can proceed as above.\n\nFunction to convert to Roman numerals:\n\ndef int_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res += r\n            num -= i\n    return res\n\nFunction to convert a number to a given base:\n\ndef to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nWait, but for base=1, but in the problem statement, the base is at least 2.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nFor each test case:\n\na, b, c = test_case.\n\nCompute val = from_base(c, int(a)).\n\nIf b is 'R':\n\n   roman = int_to_roman(val)\n\n   print(roman)\n\nElse:\n\n   base_b = int(b)\n\n   s = to_base(val, base_b)\n\n   print(s)\n\nBut wait, in the sample test case 2, when part2 is R, we output 'V' as the Roman numeral, not considering the base.\n\nSo the code as above is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nTest case 1:\n\na=10, b=2.\n\nc is '1' → val=1.\n\nb is not R, so convert 1 to base 2: '1'.\n\nOutput is '1'.\n\nTest case 2:\n\na=16, b='R'.\n\nc is '5' → val=5.\n\nb is R → output 'V'.\n\nTest case3:\n\na=5, b='R'.\n\nc is '4' → val=4.\n\noutput 'IV'.\n\nTest case4:\n\na=2, b=2.\n\nc is '1111001' → binary 1111001 is 1+2+4+8+16+32=63.\n\nconvert 63 to base 2: '1111111'.\n\nBut the sample output is '1111001'? Wait, no. Wait, '1111001' in base 2 is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 +1*2^0 = 64 +32 +16 +8 + 0 +0 +1= 121.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the fourth test case's c is '1111001' in base 2, which is 121. So the output is 121 in base 2, which is '1111001'.\n\nYes, so the code would output '1111001'.\n\nTest case5:\n\na=12, b=13.\n\nc is 'A' → 10.\n\nb is 13, not R. So 10 in base 13 is 'A'.\n\nSo output 'A'.\n\nAll sample outputs match.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: c is '0' in base a.\n\nBut the problem says c is non-zero.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"it is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\"\n\nSo c is never zero.\n\nSo no need to handle zero.\n\nAnother edge case: when converting to Roman numerals, for example, 3999 → 'MMMCMXCIX'.\n\nAnother case: 2000 → 'MM'.\n\nNow, what about very large numbers, but within the constraints.\n\nAlso, for the to_base function, when n is zero, it returns '0', but the problem says c is non-zero, so that case won't happen.\n\nAnother thing: the to_base function should not have leading zeros.\n\nWhich it does, because for n>0, the loop runs until n becomes zero.\n\nWhat about when n is zero, but the function is called? But as per the problem, it's not possible.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nBut wait, the function to_base needs to handle base up to 36.\n\nWhich it does.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead the test cases, process each one.\n\nImplement the helper functions.\n\nBut in Python, for reading the input, we have to read all lines, split into tokens, etc.\n\nSo here's the code:\n\nRead all lines.\n\nProcess each test case.\n\nHandle each part.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as a list of lines, each being a test case.\n\nBut in practice, the code reads from stdin, which is a stream of lines.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef from_base(s, base):\n    val = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            d = int(ch)\n        else:\n            d = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        val = val * base + d\n    return val\n\ndef int_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res += r\n            num -= i\n    return res\n\ndef to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef main():\n    lines = []\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        line = line.strip()\n        if line:\n            lines.append(line)\n    test_cases = []\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(lines):\n        a_b = lines[i].split()\n        a = a_b[0]\n        b = a_b[1]\n        i += 1\n        c = lines[i]\n        i += 1\n        test_cases.append( (a, b, c) )\n    for a, b, c in test_cases:\n        base_a = int(a)\n        if b == 'R':\n            val = from_base(c, base_a)\n            roman = int_to_roman(val)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            base_b = int(b)\n            val = from_base(c, base_a)\n            s = to_base(val, base_b)\n            print(s)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first line is '10 2\\n1', which is split into '10' and '2' as expected.\n\nBut wait, in the code, a and b are taken as a_b[0] and a_b[1], which is correct.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nProcessing:\n\nTest case 1: a=10, b=2, c='1' → val=1. Since b is not R, convert 1 to base 2: '1'.\n\nTest case 2: a=16, b='R', c='5' → val=5. Output 'V'.\n\nTest case3: a=5, b='R', c='4' → val=4. Output 'IV'.\n\nTest case4: a=2, b=2, c='1111001' → val=63. Convert to base 2: '1111111'? Wait, 63 is 111111 in binary, which is 6 digits. Wait, no:\n\nWait, 63 in binary is 111111 (binary for 63 is 6 ones). But the c is '1111001' which is 7 digits.\n\nWait, let me compute '1111001' in base 2:\n\n1 * 2^6 = 64\n\n1 * 2^5 = 32 → total 96\n\n1 * 2^4 = 16 → 112\n\n1 * 2^3 = 8 → 120\n\n0 * 2^2 = 0 → 120\n\n0 * 2^1 = 0 → 120\n\n1 * 2^0 = 1 → 121.\n\nAh, so val is 121.\n\nSo when part2 is 2, we convert 121 to base 2: 121 in binary is 1111001.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: the fifth test case.\n\na=12, b=13, c='A' → val=10.\n\nConvert to base 13: 10 is 'A'.\n\nSo the output is 'A'.\n\nThus, the code should pass the sample cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling uppercase letters in the Roman function. But the code converts to uppercase.\n\n- Ensuring that the to_base function correctly handles bases up to 36.\n\n- Handling leading zeros in c.\n\nBut the from_base function correctly parses leading zeros, as they contribute 0 to the value.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from base `a` to base `b`, with a special case when the second part of the door's lock is 'R', which indicates using Roman numerals for the conversion.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input:** Read all input lines and split them into test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains the bases `a` and `b`, and the second line contains the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion Functions:**\n   - **from_base(s, base):** Converts a string `s` from base `base` to a decimal integer.\n   - **int_to_roman(num):** Converts a decimal integer `num` to its Roman numeral representation.\n   - **to_base(n, base):** Converts a decimal integer `n` to the given base `base` as a string.\n3. **Processing Each Test Case:**\n   - For each test case, determine if the second part (part2) is 'R' or a number.\n   - If part2 is 'R', convert the number from base `a` to a Roman numeral and print it.\n   - Otherwise, convert the number from base `a` to base `b` and print the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef from_base(s, base):\n    val = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            d = int(ch)\n        else:\n            d = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        val = val * base + d\n    return val\n\ndef int_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res += r\n            num -= i\n    return res\n\ndef to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    test_cases = []\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(lines):\n        a_b = lines[i].split()\n        a = a_b[0]\n        b = a_b[1]\n        i += 1\n        c = lines[i]\n        i += 1\n        test_cases.append((a, b, c))\n    \n    for a, b, c in test_cases:\n        base_a = int(a)\n        if b == 'R':\n            val = from_base(c, base_a)\n            roman = int_to_roman(val)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            base_b = int(b)\n            val = from_base(c, base_a)\n            s = to_base(val, base_b)\n            print(s)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The code reads all input lines, splits them into test cases, and processes each one individually.\n2. **Conversion Functions:**\n   - `from_base` converts a string from a given base to a decimal integer.\n   - `int_to_roman` converts a decimal integer to its Roman numeral representation using predefined values and strings.\n   - `to_base` converts a decimal integer to a specified base, handling bases up to 36 by using letters for digits beyond 9.\n3. **Processing Each Test Case:** For each test case, the code checks if the second part is 'R'.
