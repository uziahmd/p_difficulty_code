The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where Neko found some treasure chests and keys, and needs to open as many chests as possible. The way it works is that each key can unlock a chest if the sum of their numbers is odd. Hmm, right.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. So the problem is about matching keys and chests such that a_i + b_j is odd. Which means one is even and the other is odd. Because an even plus an odd is odd, and vice versa.\n\nSo the first thing I need to do is figure out how many chests are even and how many are odd, similarly for the keys. Because each key can only be used once, and each chest once.\n\nWait, right. So for each key, if it's even, it can only open chests with odd a_i. And if the key is odd, then it can open chests with even a_i.\n\nSo maybe the optimal way is to count how many even and odd keys there are, and how many even and odd chests there are, and then pair them in the best possible way.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd a_i (chest numbers).\n2. Count the number of even and odd b_j (key numbers).\n3. Then, find the maximum possible matching between the keys and chests based on these counts.\n\nFor example:\n- Even keys can match with Odd chests.\n- Odd keys can match with Even chests.\n\nSo the maximum number of chests we can open would be the sum of the minimum of (even_keys * even_chests) and (odd_keys * odd_chests), but wait, no. Wait, because each key can be used once, and each chest can be used once.\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly that. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have:\n- E_c: number of even chests\n- O_c: number of odd chests\n- E_k: number of even keys\n- O_k: number of odd keys\n\nThen, each even key can be paired with an odd chest. Each odd key can be paired with an even chest.\n\nBut since each key can be used once, and each chest once, the maximum possible is the sum of the two possibilities:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is min(E_k, O_c) + min(O_k, E_c). But wait, is that the case?\n\nWait, maybe not. Because sometimes you might have more keys than chests, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum is the minimum between (E_k + O_k) and the total chests, but that's not accurate because some chests can't be matched due to the parity.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the maximum number of chests that can be unlocked by optimally assigning the keys.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nWe can model this as a bipartite graph where one side is the keys and the other is the chests. An edge exists between a key j and a chest i if a_i + b_j is odd. We need to find the maximum matching.\n\nBut with n and m up to 1e5, we can't model this directly. So we need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nEach key contributes to certain chests. For even keys, they can only unlock odd chests. So the number of chests that can be unlocked by even keys is the minimum of E_k and O_c. Similarly, the number of chests that can be unlocked by odd keys is min(O_k, E_c).\n\nBut wait, adding these two gives the maximum possible, but what if the sum exceeds the total number of chests? No, because each chest can be unlocked at most once. So the total possible is the sum of the two minima, but it cannot exceed the total number of chests.\n\nWait, no. Because if E_k is 10, O_c is 5. Then even keys can unlock 5 chests. Similarly, O_k is 6, E_c is 3. So odd keys can unlock 3 chests. Total 8, which is less than n=14. So that's okay.\n\nBut in some cases, the sum could be larger than the total chests. Like E_k=3, O_c=5; O_k=4, E_c=2. So even keys unlock 3, odd keys unlock 2: total 5, which is <=n=7.\n\nWait, but what if E_k=5, O_c=3, and O_k=5, E_c=3. Then even keys can unlock 3, odd keys can unlock 3, total 6 chests. Which is less than n=6? Or same as n?\n\nWait, n is the total chests. So in any case, the sum of the two minima can't exceed n, because each even key unlocks an odd chest, and each odd key unlocks an even chest, and all chests are either even or odd.\n\nWait, but each chest can be unlocked by only one key.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. Each key can unlock a chest if their numbers have an odd sum. This means one must be even and the other odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Even and Odd Values**: First, count how many of the chests and keys are even and how many are odd.\n2. **Calculate Possible Pairs**: Each even key can unlock an odd chest, and each odd key can unlock an even chest. The maximum number of chests that can be unlocked by even keys is the minimum of the number of even keys and the number of odd chests. Similarly, the maximum number of chests that can be unlocked by odd keys is the minimum of the number of odd keys and the number of even chests.\n3. **Sum the Pairs**: The total number of chests that can be unlocked is the sum of the two values calculated above.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    m = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx +=2\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx +=n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+m]))\n    \n    # Count even and odd in a\n    even_a = 0\n    odd_a = 0\n    for num in a:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_a +=1\n        else:\n            odd_a +=1\n    \n    # Count even and odd in b\n    even_b = 0\n    odd_b = 0\n    for num in b:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_b +=1\n        else:\n            odd_b +=1\n    \n    # Maximum possible pairs\n    max_even_key = min(even_b, odd_a)\n    max_odd_key = min(odd_b, even_a)\n    total = max_even_key + max_odd_key\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of chests `n`, the number of keys `m`, the list of chest values `a`, and the list of key values `b`.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Values**: We iterate through the lists `a` and `b` to count how many even and odd numbers each contains.\n3. **Calculating Maximum Pairs**: Using the counts from the previous step, we determine how many chests can be unlocked by even keys (matching with odd chests) and how many by odd keys (matching with even chests).\n4. **Output the Result**: The sum of these two values gives the maximum number of chests that can be unlocked, which is then printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of chests Neko can open by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers and their combinations.",
