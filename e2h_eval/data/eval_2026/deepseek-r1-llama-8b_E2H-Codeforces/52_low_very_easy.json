Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Vasily wants to maximize the number of hours his candles can burn. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each candle burns for one hour and then goes out. But when you have b burned-out candles, you can make a new one. So the idea is to keep track of the leftover candles after burning them and use those to create new ones, which in turn can be burned again.\n\nLet me break it down. Suppose we start with 'a' candles. Each time we burn them, they become 'b' used candles. But wait, no, each candle gives one used candle. So if I have x candles, after burning, I get x used candles. Then, I can convert some of these into new candles.\n\nWait, the process is: each candle gives 1 used candle. So after burning all initial candles, I have a used candles. Then, I can exchange every b used candles for a new one. So the first step is to compute how many new candles I can make from the initial a.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input, a=4 and b=2. After burning, you have 4 used candles. Since each new candle requires 2 used, you can make 4/2 = 2 new candles. Burn them, adding 2 to the total hours (so 4+2=6), and now you have 2 used candles again. Make another 1 new candle, burn it, adding 1 more hour (total 7). Now you have 1 used candle, but since b is 2, you can't make any more.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n- Total = a\n- left = a // b (number of new candles made from initial)\n- add left to total\n- Then, the remaining used candles are a % b + left (because after making 'left' new candles, each of those also becomes a used candle when burned)\nWait, no. Wait, when you make 'left' new candles, you burn them, which adds 'left' used candles. So the total used candles after burning all the new ones would be (original used) + (newly made used).\n\nHmm, maybe I should model this as a loop. Let's see.\n\nWe can represent the process as:\n\n- total_hours = a (initial burn)\n- used = a\n- while used >= b:\n    new_candles = used // b\n    total_hours += new_candles\n    used = (used % b) + new_candles  # because used//b is how many new candles, each of which will add one used after burning\nRepeat until used < b.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate how many new candles can be made from the initial a.\n2. Add that to the total.\n3. Update the used candles to be the remainder of a divided by b plus the new candles (since each new candle gives one used).\n4. Repeat the process until the used candles are less than b.\n\nSo let's take the first example:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\nInitial total=4, used=4.\n\nFirst iteration: used >=2.\n\nnew =4//2=2. total becomes 6.\n\nused becomes 4%2=0 + 2=2.\n\nNext iteration: 2>=2.\n\nnew=1. total=7.\n\nused becomes 0 +1=1.\n\nNow 1<2, so stop. Total is 7.\n\nAnother example: input is 6 3.\n\nInitial total=6. used=6.\n\n6//3=2. total=8.\n\nused becomes 6%3=0 +2=2.\n\nNow 2<3, so stop. So output is 8.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: a=0? Well, constraints say a is at least 1, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nCase 2: a=1, b=1000. Then, he can only burn 1 hour, no more.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=5.\n\nBurn 5, get 5 used. Make 1 new, burn it, total 6. Used is 5%5=0 +1=1. Can't make more.\n\nSo total is 6.\n\nWhat about a=10, b=3.\n\nInitial burn:10 hours. used=10.\n\n10//3=3, add 3. total=13.\n\nused=10%3=1 +3=4.\n\n4 >=3: 4//3=1. add 1. total=14.\n\nused=1 +1=2. Stop.\n\nSo total is 14.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo the plan is to implement this loop.\n\nIn Python, the code would read a and b, compute the total as per the steps",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the given candles. Each candle burns for one hour and then goes out, but Vasily can convert a certain number of these used candles into new ones to continue burning.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles `a` and the conversion rate `b`, where `b` used candles can be converted into one new candle.\n2. **Burn Initial Candles**: Burn all initial candles to get the total initial hours of illumination, which is equal to `a`.\n3. **Convert Used Candles**: After burning the initial candles, collect the used ones. Convert as many as possible into new candles using the conversion rate `b`.\n4. **Repeat Conversion**: Continue converting the used candles into new ones until the number of used candles is less than `b`. Each time new candles are made, they are burned, contributing to the total illumination hours and again producing used candles.\n5. **Loop Until Exhaustion**: Keep track of the total hours and the number of used candles until no more conversions can be made.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nused = a\nwhile used >= b:\n    new = used // b\n    total += new\n    used = (used % b) + new\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the integers `a` and `b` from the input.\n2. **Initial Hours Calculation**: The initial number of candles `a` gives the first set of hours, which is directly added to the total.\n3. **Used Candles Collection**: After burning all initial candles, the count of used candles is initialized to `a`.\n4. **Conversion Loop**: The loop continues as long as there are enough used candles (`used >= b`) to make at least one new candle. In each iteration, it calculates how many new candles can be made, adds this number to the total hours, and updates the count of used candles to include both the remainder from the previous conversion and the new candles just burned.\n5. **Output Result**: Once the loop exits, the total number of hours is printed, which is the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the conversion process and ensures that we maximize the number of hours the candles can burn by repeatedly converting used candles into new ones whenever possible.",
