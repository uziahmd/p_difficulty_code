He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine for each of the 2n-2 given strings whether it's a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. The output is a string where each character is either 'P' or 'S' based on that classification.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. The main idea is that for each possible string length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings: one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. But wait, no—wait, the problem says that each length from 1 to n-1 has exactly two strings, but they could be both prefixes, both suffixes, or one of each. No, no, wait: Ivan provided all improper prefixes and suffixes, so for each length l (1<=l<=n-1), there are two strings which are either prefixes or suffixes. So for each l, two options: both are prefixes, both are suffixes, or one is a prefix and the other is a suffix? Wait, no, because the problem says \"it is guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n.\" So for each l, the two strings must be such that one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Because otherwise, if for some l, both were prefixes or both were suffixes, then the original string would have two different prefixes of the same length, which is impossible. So for each l, one string is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Because perhaps for a certain l, the two strings are both prefixes but the string s has multiple possible prefixes of length l. But the problem statement says that for each l, there are exactly two strings, and that it's guaranteed that they are prefixes and/or suffixes of some s of length n. So perhaps for each l, the two strings are such that one is a prefix of s and the other is a suffix. Or maybe one is a prefix and the other is also a prefix but a different one. But that can't be, because a string can't have two different proper prefixes of the same length. So for each l, one string is a prefix and the other is a suffix. So for each l, the two strings are a prefix and a suffix.\n\nSo the plan is: for each possible string in the input, determine whether it's a prefix or a suffix of s.\n\nBut how do I figure out which one is the prefix and which is the suffix? Because for each l, the two strings can be in any order.\n\nI think the key is to find for each possible l, the correct assignment of the two strings as P or S, such that all constraints are satisfied across the entire set of strings.\n\nThis feels like a graph problem where each string's role (prefix or suffix) affects the possible candidates for longer lengths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this by building the possible prefixes and suffixes step by step.\n\nLet me think: the original string s has a prefix p_1 of length 1, p_2 of length 2, up to p_{n-1} of length n-1. Similarly, it has suffixes s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n-1}, where each s_i is the last i characters of s.\n\nEach of these p_i and s_j must match the given strings for their respective lengths.\n\nMoreover, for each l, exactly one of the two given strings is a prefix (p_l) and the other is a suffix (s_l).\n\nWait, no. Because for a given l, the prefix is p_l and the suffix is s_l. So for each l, among the two given strings of length l, one must be p_l and the other must be s_l.\n\nSo, our task is to assign each string of length l to be either a prefix or a suffix, ensuring that for each l, exactly one is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nThe problem is to find an assignment of each string to 'P' or 'S' such that:\n\n- For each l, the two strings of length l are assigned P and S (in either order).\n- For all l < k, if a string of length l is a prefix, then any string of length k that starts with that prefix must agree with the assignment.\n\nWait, perhaps more formally: the structure of the original string is such that p_1 is the first character, p_2 is the first two, etc. So p_1 must be the first character of p_2, and so on. Similarly, the suffix s_1 is the last character, s_2 is last two, etc., so s_2 must end with s_1.\n\nTherefore, for the assignment to be consistent, for each l, the prefix p_l must be equal to the first l characters of s, and the suffix s_l must be equal to the last l characters of s.\n\nAlso, for l < k, p_k must start with p_l, and s_k must end with s_l.\n\nSo, the approach is to find for each l, which of the two given strings is p_l and which is s_l, such that the constraints between different l's are satisfied.\n\nHow can we model this?\n\nPerhaps we can model the possible transitions between l and l+1. For example, for each possible pair of strings of length l and l+1, check if the string of length l+1 starts with the string of length l (if the string of length l is a prefix) or ends with it (if the string of length l is a suffix).\n\nWait, but since for each l, the two strings are assigned to P and S, perhaps we can build a directed graph where each node represents a possible state of the current position in the string, and edges represent possible transitions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better way is to consider that the entire assignment must form a chain of prefixes and suffixes that fit together correctly.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's try to find for each l, which of the two possible strings is the prefix. Once we know the prefix for each l, the suffix for l must be the other string. Then, we can verify if the structure is consistent.\n\nBut how to decide which string is the prefix for each l.\n\nPerhaps we can proceed recursively:\n\nStart with l=1. The two strings of length 1 are the possible p_1 and s_1. We can choose one as p_1 and the other as s_1. Then, for l=2, the two strings must be such that one is a prefix starting with p_1, and the other is a suffix ending with s_1.\n\nWait, but for l=2, the two given strings must consist of one prefix and one suffix. So for each possible assignment of l=1, we can see which assignments for l=2 are compatible.\n\nBut this might get complicated as n can be up to 100, leading to a lot of possibilities.\n\nAnother idea: For each possible l, the prefix p_l must be a substring of the string s, starting at position 0, and the suffix s_l must be a substring ending at position n-1.\n\nMoreover, for l < m, p_m must start with p_l, and s_m must end with s_l.\n\nSo perhaps the way to model this is to create a graph where each node is a possible (prefix, suffix) pair for a certain length, and edges represent the possibility of moving to the next length.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, we can model the problem by considering that the entire assignment must form a chain where each step builds upon the previous.\n\nFor example, for l=1, suppose we choose string A as p_1 and B as s_1.\n\nThen, for l=2, the two strings must be:\n\nEither:\n\n- A followed by some character → becomes the new prefix (so the other string is the suffix).\n\nBut the suffix must end with B.\n\nWait, perhaps for l=2, the prefix must be a prefix of s, so it must start with p_1 (A). So one of the two strings of length 2 must be equal to A + c, where c is the next character. The other string is the suffix of length 2, which must end with s_1 (B).\n\nWait, but s_2 is the last two characters of s, which includes s_1. So s_2 must end with s_1.\n\nSo, for l=2, the two strings are X and Y. One of them (say X) is the prefix of s of length 2, so X starts with p_1 (A). The other (Y) is the suffix of length 2, so Y ends with s_1 (B). So X must be A followed by a new character, and Y must end with B.\n\nOnce we have chosen which of the two strings is X and which is Y, we can proceed to l=3.\n\nAt each step, for l=k, the two strings must satisfy:\n\n- One is a prefix of s of length k, which must start with p_{k-1}.\n\n- The other is a suffix of s of length k, which must end with s_{k-1}.\n\nSo, the process is to select for each l, which string is the prefix and which is the suffix, ensuring that the constraints from lower l are satisfied.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a tree of possible choices, but for n up to 100, this approach may not be feasible due to computational limits.\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible l, the correct assignment can be determined based on the previous assignments.\n\nWe can model the problem by building for each l the possible pairs (prefix, suffix) that are compatible with the previous assignments.\n\nAt each step l, for each possible (prev_prefix, prev_suffix) pair from l-1, check which of the two strings for length l can extend prev_prefix to become a new prefix, and which can end with prev_suffix to become a new suffix.\n\nWait, but each step l has exactly two strings, and each must be assigned to prefix or suffix.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step is l=1. We have two strings, say s1a and s1b. One is the prefix p1, the other is the suffix s1.\n\nThen, for l=2, the two strings must be s2a and s2b. One must be the prefix p2, which starts with p1. The other must be the suffix s2, which ends with s1.\n\nSo, for each possible assignment of l=1 (which is choosing which is p1 and which is s1), we can check whether the l=2 strings can be assigned accordingly.\n\nIf any assignment leads to a consistent chain, then that's our solution.\n\nBut the problem is that for each l, the choice depends on the previous steps, so this can get complex.\n\nBut perhaps we can model this as a dynamic programming problem, tracking for each possible l, the possible pairs of prefix and suffix, and ensuring that the constraints are met.\n\nBut considering that n is up to 100, and each step has a manageable number of possibilities, this might be feasible.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Group the input strings by their lengths. For each length l, collect the two strings.\n\n2. For each l, starting from 1 up to n-1, determine which string is the prefix (p_l) and which is the suffix (s_l), ensuring that:\n\n   a. p_l starts with p_{l-1} (if l > 1)\n\n   b. s_l ends with s_{l-1} (if l > 1)\n\n3. Once all p_l and s_l are determined, output the corresponding 'P'/'S' for each input string.\n\nThe challenge is step 2: determining p_l and s_l for each l.\n\nHow to approach this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the correct assignment is unique for each l, and that the assignment for l must depend on the previous assignments.\n\nSo, for l=1, we have two options: s1a is p1 and s1b is s1, or vice versa.\n\nFor each of these options, we can check whether the l=2 assignments can be made.\n\nThis seems like a recursive approach, but for n=100, this is not feasible.\n\nSo perhaps we can find a way to greedily determine the correct assignment.\n\nAnother idea is to model this as a graph where each node represents a possible (p_prev, s_prev) state, and for each l, we transition to possible (p_current, s_current) states based on the current l's strings.\n\nBut again, for n=100, this may not be computationally feasible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem can be approached by noticing that the correct assignment is determined by the overlaps between the strings.\n\nFor example, for l=1, the correct p1 is the string that appears as the prefix of all higher-length prefixes.\n\nSimilarly, the correct s1 is the suffix that appears as the suffix of all higher-length suffixes.\n\nBut this may not always hold, especially when the same string appears multiple times.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can build the possible candidates for p and s by checking for all l, what is the common prefix and suffix.\n\nWait, here's an alternative approach:\n\nWe can construct the full string s by incrementally building it. At each step l, we can determine whether the current string is the prefix or suffix.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think: The prefix p_l must be the first l characters of s, and the suffix s_l must be the last l characters.\n\nMoreover, for l>1, p_l must start with p_{l-1}, and s_l must end with s_{l-1}.\n\nSo, for each l, after choosing p_{l} and s_{l}, we can check if they fit into the existing structure.\n\nBut the problem is that for each l, the two strings are unknown until we make the assignment.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a tree where each node represents a possible state of the current p and s, and for each l, we branch into the possible options.\n\nBut this could be too slow for n=100.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the problem requires that the answer is possible, perhaps we can find a unique assignment by considering the maximum possible overlap.\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, the correct p_l is the string that is a prefix of one of the strings of length l+1.\n\nWait, no, because for l+1, the prefix must start with p_l.\n\nSo, for each l, the p_l must be a prefix of p_{l+1}, and s_l must be a suffix of s_{l+1}.\n\nSo, the correct assignment must satisfy that for each l < k, p_k starts with p_l, and s_k ends with s_l.\n\nThus, the correct assignment is a chain where each step builds upon the previous.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to approach this is to find for each l, the pair (p_l, s_l) that satisfies:\n\n- For l=1: p_1 and s_1 are the two strings of length 1. One is p_1, the other is s_1.\n\n- For l>1: one of the two strings is p_l, which must start with p_{l-1}, and the other is s_l, which must end with s_{l-1}.\n\nSo, for each l, given the possible p_{l-1} and s_{l-1}, we can check which of the two strings of length l can be p_l and which can be s_l.\n\nWait, but for l=2, the two strings are X and Y.\n\nWe need to determine whether X is p_2 and Y is s_2, or vice versa.\n\nBut to do that, X must start with p_1, and Y must end with s_1.\n\nSo, for each possible assignment of l=1, we can see whether the l=2 strings can be assigned accordingly.\n\nBut for n=100, trying all possible combinations is not feasible.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can represent the possible candidates for p and s at each step and track them.\n\nSo, the initial step (l=1) has two possibilities: (p1a, s1a) and (p1b, s1b), assuming the two strings are a and b.\n\nWait, no, wait: For l=1, the two strings are a and b. One is the prefix, the other is the suffix.\n\nSo, for each of the two possibilities, we proceed to l=2.\n\nAt l=2, we have two strings, say x and y.\n\nWe need to determine if x is p2 and y is s2, or y is p2 and x is s2.\n\nBut p2 must start with p1, and s2 must end with s1.\n\nSo, for each possible (p1, s1) from l=1, we can check both possibilities for l=2.\n\nIf a particular option works, proceed to l=3, and so on.\n\nThis approach can be implemented using backtracking or memoization.\n\nBut for n=100, this might be too slow unless optimized.\n\nBut considering that n is up to 100, and for each step, each possible state can branch into two possibilities, the total number of states is 2^100, which is impossible.\n\nSo, this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Find the correct assignment by building the string step by step, ensuring that for each step, the current prefix and suffix fit the required constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as building a trie of possible prefixes and a reverse trie of possible suffixes.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the problem guarantees that the given strings are valid, perhaps the correct assignment can be uniquely determined by the overlaps between the strings.\n\nWait, for each l, the correct p_l is the string that is a prefix of the p_{l+1} for some l+1.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct p_l is the string that is a prefix of the majority of the p_{l+1} strings, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct assignment is the one where for each l, the p_l is a prefix of the s_l, but I don't think that's necessarily true.\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, the correct p_l is the one that is a prefix of the other string of the same length. Or perhaps not.\n\nWait, no. For example, in the sample input 3, the two strings of length 2 are 'a' and 'c'. So for l=2, the two strings are 'ac' and 'ca'. One is a prefix (e.g., 'ac') and the other is a suffix (e.g., 'ca'). So for l=2, 'ac' is p_2 and 'ca' is s_2.\n\nBut then, for l=1, the two strings are 'a' and 'c'. One is p_1 and the other is s_1.\n\nIn the sample, the correct s is 'ac' or 'ca', depending on the assignment.\n\nWait, in the sample input 3, the output can be 'PS' or 'SP'.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps the correct assignment is such that the entire set of strings forms a consistent chain, where each step builds upon the previous.\n\nSo, for each l, the correct p_l must be a prefix of the s_l. Because s is built as a sequence of adding characters, and the suffix of l is part of the string.\n\nWait, no. Because s is a string, its suffix of l is the last l characters. The prefix of l is the first l characters. These two can be completely unrelated except for overlapping in the middle.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. For example, if s is 'ababa', then the prefix of 2 is 'ab' and the suffix of 2 is 'ba'. These don't directly relate.\n\nSo, perhaps that's not a useful property.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's consider that for each l, the correct p_l is a prefix of s, and the correct s_l is a suffix of s. Moreover, for l < m, p_m must start with p_l, and s_m must end with s_l.\n\nSo, for all l, p_l is a prefix of p_{l+1}, and s_l is a suffix of s_{l+1}.\n\nThus, the assignment must form a chain where each step is compatible with the previous.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each l from 1 to n-1:\n\n   - Consider the two strings of length l.\n\n   - One must be p_l and the other s_l.\n\n   - For l>1:\n\n      - p_l must start with p_{l-1}\n\n      - s_l must end with s_{l-1}\n\nSo, the approach is to find an assignment for each l that satisfies these constraints.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps, for each l, the correct assignment is the one where p_l is a prefix of the other string of length l, or something like that.\n\nWait, for example, in the third sample input:\n\nInput:\n2\na\nc\n\nThe two strings are 'a' and 'c' for l=1.\n\nSuppose we choose 'a' as p_1 and 'c' as s_1.\n\nThen, for l=2, the two strings are 'ac' and 'ca'.\n\nWhich one is p_2 and which is s_2?\n\np_2 must start with p_1 ('a'), so 'ac' is a candidate for p_2.\n\ns_2 must end with s_1 ('c'), so 'ca' ends with 'a'? No, 'ca' ends with 'a'? Wait, 'ca' ends with 'a' only if it's the last character. 'ca' ends with 'a' yes, but wait, s_1 is 'c' (from l=1). So s_2 must end with s_1, which is 'c'. So 'ca' ends with 'a', which is not 'c'. So 'ca' can't be s_2. Therefore, 'ac' is p_2, and 'ca' is s_2.\n\nBut then, s_2 is 'ca', which ends with s_1 ('c')? 'ca' ends with 'a' which is not 'c'. So that's invalid.\n\nSo perhaps the other assignment is better: p_1 is 'c' and s_1 is 'a'.\n\nThen, for l=2, p_2 must start with 'c', so the two strings 'ac' and 'ca' must have one starting with 'c'.\n\n'ca' starts with 'c', so it's a candidate for p_2.\n\nThen, s_2 must end with s_1, which is 'a'.\n\nSo 'ca' ends with 'a' (since the last character is 'a'), so 'ca' can be s_2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, s_2 must end with s_1. s_1 is 'a' in this case.\n\nSo s_2 must end with 'a'. So 'ca' ends with 'a', so it's acceptable as s_2.\n\nSo in this case, p_2 is 'ca', which starts with 'c' (p_1), and s_2 is 'ca', which ends with 'a' (s_1).\n\nWait, but then, p_2 is 'ca' and s_2 is 'ca'—but that can't be, because for l=2, the two strings are 'ac' and 'ca'; one must be p_2 and the other s_2.\n\nSo in this case, 'ca' is p_2 (starts with 'c'), and 'ac' is s_2 (ends with 'c'? No, 'ac' ends with 'c', but s_1 is 'a', so s_2 must end with 'a'. 'ac' ends with 'c' which is not 'a', so this is invalid.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nMaybe the correct approach is to model this as a graph where each node represents the current possible (p, s) pair, and for each step l, we consider the possible transitions.\n\nBut this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each l, the correct assignment is determined by the fact that p_l must be a prefix of the next prefix, and s_l must be a suffix of the next suffix.\n\nSo, perhaps for each l, the correct p_l is the one that can be a prefix of some string of l+1, and the correct s_l is the one that can be a suffix of some string of l+1.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nWait, perhaps the following algorithm can work:\n\n1. Group the input strings by their lengths into a list for each l.\n\n2. For each l from 1 to n-1, sort the two strings for that l into possible candidates for p_l and s_l.\n\n3. For each possible assignment of p_l and s_l, check if it's compatible with the assignments for l-1.\n\n4. If all assignments are compatible, proceed.\n\nBut this sounds like a recursive approach, which is not feasible for n=100.\n\nAlternative Idea: Try to find a way to represent the correct assignment by building the string s step by step.\n\nFor each l, the correct p_l is the one that is a prefix of s, and the correct s_l is the suffix of s.\n\nMoreover, for l < m, p_m must start with p_l, and s_m must end with s_l.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find s by building it character by character, ensuring that for each l, the correct p_l and s_l are assigned.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct assignment can be found by looking for the longest possible common prefix and suffix.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct p_1 is the string that is a prefix of the majority of the strings of length 2, but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct p_1 is the string that is a prefix of the s_1.\n\nNo, because s_1 is a suffix.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's time to look for a pattern.\n\nLooking at the sample input 1:\n\nn=5, the output is SPPSPSPS.\n\nWait, the input was:\n\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba']\n\nWait, probably, the correct s is 'ababa'.\n\nSo for l=1, the two strings are 'a' and 'b'. So 'a' is s_1 and 'b' is p_1, or vice versa.\n\nWait, but according to the output, the first string is marked as S (suffix). So for l=1, the first string is a suffix, meaning s_1 is 'a'.\n\nThen, for l=2, the two strings are 'ba' and 'ab'.\n\nWhich one is p_2 and which is s_2.\n\np_2 must start with s_1 ('a'), so 'ab' starts with 'a' → p_2 is 'ab'.\n\ns_2 must end with s_1 ('a') → 'ba' ends with 'a'? No, 'ba' ends with 'a'? Yes, the last character is 'a' → yes.\n\nSo s_2 is 'ba'.\n\nThen for l=3, the two strings are 'aba' and 'bab'.\n\np_3 must start with 'ab' → 'aba' starts with 'ab' → p_3 is 'aba'.\n\ns_3 must end with 'ba' → 'bab' ends with 'ab'? No, 'bab' ends with 'b', which is not 'ba's 'a'.\n\nWait, no, wait: s_3 must end with s_2, which is 'ba'.\n\nSo s_3 is 'aba'? Let's see:\n\nThe two strings for l=3 are 'aba' and 'bab'.\n\nCheck which ends with 'ba'.\n\n'aba' ends with 'a' → no.\n\n'b ab' ends with 'ab' → no, ends with 'b'.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, perhaps for l=2, the two strings are 'ba' and 'ab'. The correct assignment is 'ba' as s_2 and 'ab' as p_2.\n\nBecause p_2 must start with p_1 ('a'), which 'ab' does.\n\ns_2 must end with s_1 ('a') → 'ba' ends with 'a', so yes.\n\nThen, for l=3, the two strings are 'aba' and 'bab'.\n\np_3 must start with 'ab' → 'aba' starts with 'ab' → yes.\n\ns_3 must end with 'ba' → 'bab' ends with 'ab' → no. 'bab' ends with 'b', which is not 'a'.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nSo perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe for l=2, 'ab' is p_2 and 'ba' is s_2.\n\nThen, for l=3, p_3 must start with 'ab' → 'aba' starts with 'ab' → yes.\n\ns_3 must end with 'ba' → 'bab' ends with 'ab' → no. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the other string is s_3.\n\nWait, 'aba' ends with 'a', which is not 'ba' → no.\n\nHmm, perhaps this indicates that the initial assignment for l=1 is incorrect.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the correct string is 'ababa'.\n\nSo for l=1, s_1 is 'a' (the suffix of length 1 is 'a').\n\np_1 is 'b' (the prefix of length 1 is 'b').\n\nWait, but then, for l=2, the two strings are 'ba' and 'ab'.\n\np_2 must start with 'b' → 'ba' starts with 'b' → yes.\n\ns_2 must end with 'a' → 'ab' ends with 'b' → no.\n\nWait, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for l=1, p_1 is 'a' and s_1 is 'b'.\n\nThen, for l=2, p_2 must start with 'a' → 'ab' starts with 'a' → yes.\n\ns_2 must end with 'b' → 'ba' ends with 'a' → no.\n\nHmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the sample input and see what the actual assignment is.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=5\n\nThe 2n-2=8 strings are:\n\nLine 0: 'ba' → l=2\n\nLine 1: 'a' → l=1\n\nLine 2: 'abab' → l=4\n\nLine 3: 'a' → l=1\n\nLine 4: 'aba' → l=3\n\nLine 5: 'baba' → l=4\n\nLine 6: 'ab' → l=2\n\nLine 7: 'aba' → l=3\n\nWait, no, perhaps I got the lines wrong. The input is:\n\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba']\n\nSo each line starts with the length, followed by the string.\n\nSo the 8 strings are:\n\n'ba' → l=2\n\n'a' → l=1\n\n'abab' → l=4\n\n'a' → l=1\n\n'aba' → l=3\n\n'baba' → l=4\n\n'ab' → l=2\n\n'aba' → l=3.\n\nWait, but for l=1, there are two 'a's. For l=2, two strings 'ba' and 'ab'. For l=3, two 'aba's. For l=4, two 'abab' and 'baba'.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, each l from 1 to n-1 has exactly two strings.\n\nSo for l=1, two 'a's. For l=2, 'ba' and 'ab'. For l=3, two 'aba's. For l=4, 'abab' and 'baba'.\n\nNow, the correct s is 'ababa'.\n\nSo, for each l:\n\nl=1: p_1 is 'a' (since s starts with 'a'), but wait no—s is 'ababa', so the first character is 'a' → p_1 is 'a'. The suffix of length 1 is 'a' → s_1 is 'a'.\n\nBut wait, the two strings for l=1 are both 'a's. So for l=1, both are p_1 and s_1. That can't be, since one must be a prefix and the other a suffix.\n\nWait, no: the problem says that for each l, the two strings are either both prefixes, both suffixes, or one of each. But in this case, both are the same string, so for l=1, both are p_1 and s_1. But that's impossible, because the string can't have two different prefixes of the same length.\n\nWait, no, because the two strings are the same. So for l=1, both are the same string, so one is p_1 and the other is s_1, but they're the same. That's allowed because they are different roles but same string.\n\nSo, for l=1, both 'a's are the same string, so one is p_1 and the other is s_1. But since they are the same, it's possible.\n\nSo, for l=1, p_1 = s_1 = 'a'.\n\nThen, for l=2, the two strings are 'ba' and 'ab'. One is p_2 and the other is s_2.\n\nSince s starts with 'ab', p_2 is 'ab'.\n\ns_2 is the last two characters of 'ababa', which is 'ba'.\n\nSo, for l=2, p_2 is 'ab' and s_2 is 'ba'.\n\nSo, the two strings for l=2 are 'ba' and 'ab', so 'ab' is p_2, 'ba' is s_2.\n\nThen, for l=3, the two strings are 'aba' and 'aba'. So p_3 must start with p_2 ('ab'), which 'aba' does. s_3 must end with s_2 ('ba').\n\nThe two strings are 'aba' and 'aba', so both are the same. So p_3 is 'aba' and s_3 is 'aba'.\n\nWait, but s_3 is the last three characters of s, which is 'aba'. So yes.\n\nFor l=4, the two strings are 'abab' and 'baba'.\n\np_4 must start with 'aba' → 'abab' starts with 'aba' → yes.\n\ns_4 must end with 'aba' → 'baba' ends with 'ba' → no. Wait, 'baba' ends with 'ba' which is not 'aba'.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, but the correct s is 'ababa' (length 5), so the suffix of length 4 is 'baba'.\n\nSo for l=4, s_4 is 'baba', which ends with 'aba'? No, 'baba' ends with 'ba'.\n\nSo, perhaps I made a mistake in the assignment.\n\nWait, for l=3, the two strings are 'aba' and 'aba'. So both are the same. So p_3 is 'aba' and s_3 is 'aba'.\n\nThen, for l=4, the two strings are 'abab' and 'baba'.\n\np_4 must start with 'aba' → 'abab' does.\n\ns_4 must end with s_3 ('aba') → 'baba' ends with 'aba'? 'baba' is 'b a b a', the last three characters are 'aba' → yes.\n\nSo s_4 is 'baba'.\n\nThen, for l=4, p_4 is 'abab' and s_4 is 'baba'.\n\nSo the assignment is correct.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the correct assignment for each l is:\n\nl=1: p='a', s='a'\n\nl=2: p='ab', s='ba'\n\nl=3: p='aba', s='aba'\n\nl=4: p='abab', s='baba'\n\nThus, the output is constructed by marking each string as P or S.\n\nIn the sample input, the order of the input strings is:\n\n['ba', 'a', 'abab', 'a', 'aba', 'baba', 'ab', 'aba']\n\nSo, the output for each string is:\n\n'ba' → l=2 → s → 'S'\n\n'a' → l=1 → both are p and s → in the output, the first 'a' is p, so 'P'; but wait, the output is SPPSPSPS.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is constructed by going through all the input strings in the order they were given, and for each, determine if it's a prefix (output 'P') or suffix (output 'S').\n\nSo for each string in the input, we need to check if it's one of the p_l's or s_l's.\n\nSo, for each string, its length l is known. We look at the two strings for that l, and determine if this string is p_l or s_l.\n\nSo, in the first sample input:\n\nAfter the assignment, for each l:\n\nl=1: two 'a's. So any 'a' in the input is either p_1 or s_1.\n\nBut in the output, the first two 'a's are marked as 'S' and 'P' respectively.\n\nWait, perhaps the first 'a' in the input is s_1, and the second 'a' is p_1.\n\nWait, but how do we determine which is which.\n\nAh, perhaps the order in which the strings are given doesn't matter. We have to process each string, find its length l, and among the two strings of that length, determine whether it's the prefix or the suffix.\n\nSo, for each string in the input, for its length l, we can find the two strings for that l. One is p_l, the other is s_l.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine for each of the given strings whether it is a prefix or a suffix of the original string `s` of length `n`.

This is done by ensuring that the prefix starts with the previous prefix and the suffix ends with the previous suffix.\n4. **Build the Result String**: For each input string, determine if it is the prefix or suffix based on the determined assignments and construct the result string accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nstrings = []\nfor _ in range(2 * n - 2):\n    s = input().strip()\n    strings.append(s)\n\n# Group strings by their lengths\nlength_to_strings = {}\nfor s in strings:\n    l = len(s)\n    if l not in length_to_strings:\n        length_to_strings[l] = []\n    length_to_strings[l].append(s)\n\n# Prepare the answer\nanswer = []\n\nfor l in range(1, n):\n    # We have two strings for this length\n    candidates = length_to_strings[l]\n    # Determine p_l and s_l\n    # For all possible pairs, check compatibility with previous step\n    # Since the correct assignment is unique, we can find it by checking which pair fits\n    # Start with all possible assignments for the first step\n    if l == 1:\n        # For l=1, both are either p or s, but since they are same, assign one as p and the other as s\n        # So, the first occurrence is p_1 and the second is s_1, but since they are same, it's arbitrary\n        p = candidates[0]\n        s = candidates[1]\n        # But wait, both are same, so any assignment is possible.
