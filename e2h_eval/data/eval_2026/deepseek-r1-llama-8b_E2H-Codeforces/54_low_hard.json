Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a regular convex n-gon, and I need to find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The output should be these three vertices in order. If there are multiple optimal solutions, any is acceptable.\n\nHmm. So the first thing I need to figure out is how to compute the possible angles that can be formed by selecting three vertices in this way, and then find which one is closest to 'a'.\n\nLet me think about the structure of a regular polygon. Each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. The central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. So for each step between vertices, we add 360/n degrees.\n\nWhen forming an angle at v2 with v1 and v3 on either side, the angle depends on how far apart v1 and v3 are from v2. Since the polygon is regular, the angle can be calculated based on the number of edges between them.\n\nWait, right. For example, in a triangle (n=3), each internal angle is 60 degrees. So any triplet would give 60 degrees.\n\nIn a square (n=4), if I pick consecutive vertices, the angle would be 90 degrees. But if I pick every other vertex, the angle might be something else. Wait, no, because in a square, the diagonals form 45-degree angles? Or wait, perhaps not. Let me think: when you form an angle at v2 with v1 and v3 being two steps away, maybe that's where the 45-degree angle comes from.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle at v2 depends on the step size between v1 and v3. Like, for a regular polygon, the angle formed by choosing k steps clockwise and m steps counter-clockwise (or something like that) will determine the angle.\n\nBut I'm not exactly sure about the formula here. Maybe I should derive it.\n\nSo, considering a regular n-gon inscribed in a unit circle. The position of each vertex can be represented as (cos(theta), sin(theta)), where theta is (i*2π)/n for vertex i.\n\nWhen we choose three points v1, v2, v3, the angle at v2 is the angle between vectors v2v1 and v2v3. To compute this angle, I can use vector math.\n\nWait, but since the polygon is regular and all points lie on a circle, there's a formula for the angle at v2. I remember that in a regular polygon, the angle formed by two points that are k steps apart (in either direction) from v2 is equal to (k * (180*(n-2)/n)) / something. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the angle can be calculated as the difference between the arcs corresponding to the steps.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the central angles. Suppose v2 is at some point. Then, the central angles for v1 and v3 relative to v2 are determined by the number of steps between them.\n\nFor example, if v1 is k steps clockwise from v2, and v3 is m steps clockwise from v2, then the angle at v2 can be computed based on the arc between v1 and v3.\n\nAlternatively, the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3, but wait, that might be for circles. Oh right, in a circle, the inscribed angle subtended by an arc is half the measure of the arc. So in our case, the polygon is inscribed in a circle, so the angle at v2 is half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3, but only if the polygon is considered on the circumference.\n\nWait, but in a regular polygon, the points are placed on a circle, so any three points will form a triangle inscribed in that circle. So the angle at v2 is indeed half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3, but perhaps also considering the direction.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc that is opposite to v2. Because in an inscribed angle, the angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.\n\nSo, for v2, the intercepted arc between v1 and v3 is the sum of the steps from v1 to v3 passing through the polygon. So, the angle at v2 would be (arc_length) / 2, where arc_length is the measure of the arc between v1 and v3, measured in the same direction as the polygon.\n\nWait, but in a regular polygon, the arc can be measured in two ways: clockwise and counter-clockwise. So perhaps the minimal arc is considered.\n\nBut let's get back to the formula. The angle at v",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of these vertices is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and how angles are formed by selecting vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Polygon Structure**: A regular polygon has vertices equally spaced around a circle. The central angle between two adjacent vertices is `360/n` degrees.\n2. **Angle Calculation**: The angle at a vertex v2 formed by vertices v1 and v3 can be determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3 relative to v2. This angle is derived from the inscribed angle theorem in circles, which states that an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.\n3. **Finding Optimal Angle**: For each vertex v2, calculate the possible angles formed by considering different step sizes k (clockwise) and m (counter-clockwise). The goal is to find the closest angle to 'a'.\n4. **Iterate Efficiently**: Iterate through each vertex as v2 and compute the angles for various step sizes, keeping track of the closest angle found.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\n\nbest_diff = float('inf')\nbest_v2 = -1\nbest_v1 = -1\nbest_v3 = -1\n\nfor v2 in range(1, n+1):\n    for k in range(1, n):\n        v1 = (v2 + k) % n\n        if v1 == 0:\n            v1 = n\n        arc = k * (360 // n)\n        angle = arc / 2\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < best_diff or (diff == best_diff and (k, n-k) not in [(1, n-1), (2, n-2)]):\n            best_diff = diff\n            best_v2 = v2\n            best_v1 = v1\n            best_v3 = v3 if v3 != v1 else ... ?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to rethink the approach. Instead of trying all possible combinations, I can compute for each vertex v2, the possible angles by stepping k steps clockwise and (n - k) steps counter-clockwise, but maybe considering both directions.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to consider that for each vertex v2, the angle formed by moving k steps clockwise and m steps counter-clockwise. But since the polygon is regular, moving k steps clockwise is equivalent to moving (n - k) steps counter-clockwise. So, for each k from 1 to (n//2), compute the angle and see if it's the closest to 'a'.\n\nBut I also need to consider that the angle could be formed in either direction, so the minimal arc would be min(k, n - k).\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for the angle is (min(k, n - k) * 180 * (n-2)/n) / 2? Or wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIn a regular polygon with n sides, each internal angle is (n-2)*180/n degrees. The angle formed by vertices v1, v2, v3 depends on the number of edges between v1 and v3 relative to v2.\n\nIf v1 is k steps clockwise from v2, and v3 is m steps clockwise from v2, then the angle at v2 would be based on the arc between v1 and v3. However, the angle is determined by the minimal arc between v1 and v3.\n\nSo, for each vertex v2, we can iterate over possible step sizes k (from 1 to floor(n/2)), compute the angle, and track the closest one to 'a'.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n1. For each vertex v2 (from 1 to n):\n   a. For each possible step size k (from 1 to n//2):\n      i. Compute the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2.\n      ii. Calculate the angle at v2 using the inscribed angle theorem.\n      iii. Track the closest angle to 'a' and record the corresponding vertices.\n\n2. After checking all possibilities, output the vertices that give the closest angle.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\n\nbest_diff = float('inf')\nbest_v2 = -1\nbest_v1 = -1\nbest_v3 = -1\n\nfor v2 in range(1, n + 1):\n    max_step = (n - 1) // 2\n    for step in range(1, max_step + 1):\n        v1 = v2 + step\n        if v1 > n:\n            v1 -= n\n        v3 = v2 - step\n        if v3 < 1:\n            v3 += n\n        \n        # Calculate the angle\n        arc = step * (360 // n)\n        angle = arc // 2  # Because the angle is half the arc in degrees\n        \n        # Calculate absolute difference\n        current_diff = abs(angle - a)\n        \n        # Check if this is the best solution so far\n        if current_diff < best_diff or \\\n           (current_diff == best_diff and (step, n - step) not in [(1, n-1), (2, n-2)]):\n            best_diff = current_diff\n            best_v2 = v2\n            best_v1 = v1\n            best_v3 = v3\n\nprint(f\"{best_v1} {best_v2} {best_v3}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe code iterates through each vertex as the potential vertex v2 where the angle is formed.
