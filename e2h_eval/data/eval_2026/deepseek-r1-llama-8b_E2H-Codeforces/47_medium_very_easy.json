    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a + k) and (b + k) is minimized. And if there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, I choose the smallest one.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that the LCM of two numbers is equal to their product divided by their GCD. So, LCM(x, y) = x*y / GCD(x, y). So, to minimize the LCM, I need to maximize the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k).\n\nWait, because the product part is (a+k)*(b+k), which depends on k. But maybe I can find a way to express this in terms of the difference between a and b.\n\nLet me see. Let's denote d as the absolute difference between a and b. So, d = |a - b|. Without loss of generality, let's assume that a <= b, so b = a + d.\n\nThen, a +k and b +k are (a +k) and (a +d +k). The difference between them is still d. So, the GCD of these two numbers must divide d. Because the difference between the two is d, any common divisor of (a +k) and (a +d +k) must also divide d.\n\nSo, the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) is a divisor of d. That's an important point. So, for each possible divisor g of d, I can check if it's possible to have (a +k) and (b +k) both divisible by g.\n\nBut wait, since (a +k) and (a +d +k) differ by d, their GCD is the same as the GCD of (a +k) and d. So, GCD(a +k, b +k) = GCD(a +k, d).\n\nSo, to maximize the GCD, I should find the largest possible divisor of d such that a +k is a multiple of that divisor. Then, the LCM will be minimized.\n\nSo, the strategy is: iterate over all possible divisors of d, and for each divisor g, compute the minimal k that makes (a +k) divisible by g, then calculate the resulting LCM and track the minimum.\n\nBut wait, how do I get all the divisors of d? Well, first, I need to compute all the divisors of d, including 1 and d itself. For each divisor g, I can compute k as (g - a % g) % g. But wait, not exactly. Because a mod g gives the remainder when a is divided by g. So, a +k needs to be a multiple of g. So, k = (g - (a % g)) % g. Because if a is already divisible by g, then k is zero. Otherwise, it's (g - a mod g).\n\nWait, but since k has to be non-negative, that's correct.\n\nOnce I find k for each g, I can compute (a +k) and (b +k), which will both be multiples of g. Their GCD will be at least g, which is a divisor of d. So, the maximum possible GCD is d, but that's only if a and b are such that a +k and b +k are multiples of d.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|. If d is zero, then a and b are equal. So, the LCM is a (or b). So, k=0 is the answer.\n\n2. Else, find all the divisors of d. For each divisor g, compute k as (g - (a % g)) % g. But wait, no—since a can be larger than g, perhaps I should compute the remainder correctly. Wait, a +k must be congruent to 0 mod g. So, a mod g is r, so k must be (g - r) mod g. But since k is non-negative, that's fine.\n\n3. For each possible g (divisor of d), compute the k, then compute the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k). Keep track of the minimal LCM and the corresponding k. If multiple k's yield the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\nBut wait, what if d is zero? Then a and b are equal. So, a +k and b +k are same, so LCM is a +k. To minimize it, set k=0. So, the output is 0.\n\nOtherwise, proceed with the divisors.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Compute d = abs(a - b)\n- If d == 0: return 0\n- Else, find all the divisors of d\n- For each divisor g in the divisors:\n   - compute required_k = (g - (a % g)) % g\n   - new_a = a + required_k\n   - new_b = b + required_k\n   - current_gcd = gcd(new_a, new_b)\n   - current_lcm = (new_a * new_b) // current_gcd\n   - keep track of the minimal lcm and the smallest k that achieves it.\n- Also, considering that for some g's, the k might be the same, but the LCM could vary. So, we need to evaluate all possible g's.\n\nWait, but why do I need to consider all divisors of d? Because the maximum possible GCD is when (a +k) and (b +k) share the largest possible divisor of d. So, to find the optimal k, we need to try all possible divisors of d, compute the required k, then compute the LCM, and find the minimal one.\n\nBut wait, what about other possible values of k that don't align with any divisor of d? For example, suppose d=6, and a=5, b=11. So d=6. Divisors are 1,2,3,6. Suppose for g=6, the required_k is (6 -5%6)=1. Then a+1=6, b+1=12. LCM is 12. What if k is 3? Then a+3=8, b+3=14. GCD is 2, LCM is (8*14)/2 =56, which is worse. So, in this case, the best is when k=1.\n\nBut what about a different scenario where k is chosen such that the GCD is higher than any divisor of d? I don't think that's possible because the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) is a divisor of d. So, the maximum possible is d.\n\nSo, considering all the divisors of d is sufficient.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nCompute all divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g, compute the required k.\n\nCalculate the LCM for that k.\n\nKeep track of the minimum LCM and the corresponding k.\n\nAdditionally, since for some g's the k can be zero (if a is already a multiple of g), which may lead to a good result.\n\nBut wait, let's see an example.\n\nSample input 1: 6 and 10. d=4.\n\nDivisors of 4 are 1,2,4.\n\nFor g=1: required_k is 0. a+0=6, b+0=10. LCM is 30.\n\nFor g=2: required_k is 0 (since 6%2=0). a+0=6, b+0=10. Same as above.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, for g=2, a is 6, which is divisible by 2. So required_k is 0. So, a+0=6, b+0=10. The GCD is 2. So LCM is (6*10)/2=30.\n\nFor g=4: required_k is (4 -6%4) mod4 → 6 mod4 is 2, so 4-2=2. So k=2. a+2=8, b+2=12. GCD is 4. LCM is (8*12)/4=24.\n\nWhich is better than 30. So the minimal is 24.\n\nSo, in this case, the minimal is achieved when g=4.\n\nAnother sample input: 5 and 10. d=5.\n\nDivisors are 1,5.\n\nFor g=1: required_k is 0. LCM is 10.\n\nFor g=5: 5 divides 5, so required_k is 0. a+0=5, b+0=10. GCD is 5, LCM is 10.\n\nSo, same as before. So, minimal LCM is 10, achieved by k=0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: 21 and 31. d=10. Divisors are 1,2,5,10.\n\nFor each g:\n\ng=1: k=0. LCM(21,31)=21*31=651.\n\ng=2: a=21 mod2=1 → k=1. a+1=22, b+1=32. GCD is 2. LCM= (22*32)/2=352.\n\ng=5: a=21 mod5=1 → k=4. a+4=25, b+4=35. GCD=5. LCM= (25*35)/5=175.\n\ng=10: a=21 mod10=1 → k=9. a+9=30, b+9=40. GCD=10. LCM= (30*40)/10=120.\n\nSo, the minimal is 120, achieved by k=9.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, the problem is how to compute all the divisors of d efficiently.\n\nBecause d can be up to 1e9, which is manageable.\n\nThe steps to compute all divisors of d:\n\n1. Factorize d into its prime factors.\n\n2. Generate all possible products of these factors, which gives all the divisors.\n\nBut factorizing d could be time-consuming if d is large, but for d up to 1e9, trial division is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to find all divisors by checking up to sqrt(d). For each i from 1 to sqrt(d), if i divides d, add i and d/i to the list of divisors. Then, after collecting all divisors, sort them.\n\nWait, yes. So, for i in 1..sqrt(d):\n\nif d%i ==0 → add i and d//i.\n\nBut then, after collecting, we need to process them, remove duplicates, sort, and then iterate through each.\n\nYes, that's manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nCompute all divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g in the list:\n\nCompute required_k = (g - (a % g)) % g.\n\nBut wait, a can be larger than g, so a mod g can be anything between 0 and g-1.\n\nWait, required_k is the smallest non-negative integer such that (a +k) is divisible by g. So, it's (g - (a mod g)) % g. Because if a mod g is zero, then required_k is zero. Else, it's (g - (a mod g)).\n\nSo, for example, a=5, g=2 → 5 mod2=1 → required_k=1.\n\nSo, code-wise, required_k = (g - (a % g)) % g.\n\nBut wait, since a and b can be in any order, perhaps it's better to compute d as the absolute difference.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nIf a == b:\n\n   print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n   d = abs(a - b)\n\n   find all divisors of d.\n\n   for each divisor g in the divisors:\n\n      compute rem = a % g\n\n      required_k = (g - rem) % g\n\n      new_a = a + required_k\n\n      new_b = b + required_k\n\n      current_gcd = gcd(new_a, new_b)\n\n      current_lcm = (new_a * new_b) // current_gcd\n\n      track the minimal current_lcm and the required_k.\n\n   find the required_k with the smallest current_lcm, and if tie, the smallest k.\n\nBut wait, wait—what if d is 0? Then a equals b, so adding any k doesn't change the fact that a +k and b +k are same. So, their LCM is a +k. To minimize it, k=0.\n\nSo, that's the base case.\n\nBut what about when d is 1?\n\nLike a=3, b=4. d=1.\n\nDivisors are 1.\n\nrequired_k = (1 -3%1) mod1 → 3 mod1 is 0 → 1-0=1 mod1 is 0. So k=0.\n\nnew_a=3, new_b=4. LCM is 12.\n\nBut wait, is there a better k?\n\nWhat if k=1: a+1=4, b+1=5. LCM is 20.\n\nNo, worse.\n\nk=2: a+2=5, b+2=6. LCM is 30.\n\nWorse. So indeed, k=0 is best.\n\nSo, the approach works.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=15. d=10.\n\nDivisors are 1,2,5,10.\n\nFor g=10: required_k = 10 -5 mod10 →5 mod10 is 5 → 10-5=5.\n\nSo, a+5=10, b+5=20. LCM is 20.\n\nFor g=5: required_k is (5-5%5)=0. So a+0=5, b+0=15. LCM is (5*15)/5=15. Which is worse than 20.\n\nSo, the minimal is achieved at g=10.\n\nSo, the approach works.\n\nSo, now, the key is to generate all the divisors of d.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut wait, what if d is zero? Then, as discussed earlier, return 0.\n\nSo, let's outline the code:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nif a == b:\n\n   print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n   d = abs(a - b)\n\n   # compute all divisors of d\n\n   def get_divisors(n):\n\n       divisors = set()\n\n       for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) +1):\n\n           if n % i ==0:\n\n               divisors.add(i)\n\n               divisors.add(n//i)\n\n       return sorted(divisors)\n\n   divisors = get_divisors(d)\n\n   min_lcm = float('inf')\n\n   best_k = 0\n\n   for g in divisors:\n\n       rem = a % g\n\n       k = (g - rem) % g\n\n       new_a = a +k\n\n       new_b = b +k\n\n       current_gcd = math.gcd(new_a, new_b)\n\n       current_lcm = (new_a * new_b) // current_gcd\n\n       if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and k < best_k):\n\n           min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n           best_k = k\n\n   print(best_k)\n\nWait, but in the code, the initial min_lcm is infinity, and best_k is 0. But what if all the divisors are considered and none of them give a better LCM than others? Like, for example, when d=0, but that's handled earlier.\n\nBut wait, when d is non-zero, for each divisor g, the code computes a k, which is non-negative.\n\nBut, for each g, the computed k may not be the minimal possible. Wait, no. Because for each g, we're finding the smallest possible k that makes a +k a multiple of g.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nWait, but in the code, the loop is over all the divisors, and for each, calculates the required k.\n\nBut wait, what if the same k is obtained for multiple g's?\n\nFor example, a=5, b=10, d=5.\n\ng=5: required_k is 0.\n\ng=1: required_k is 0.\n\nBut in the code, for each g, the k is calculated, and the minimal LCM is tracked.\n\nBut since for g=5, the current_lcm is (5+0)*(10+0)/5=50/5=10.\n\nFor g=1, the current_lcm is (5+0)*(10+0)/1=50.\n\nSo, in this case, the code correctly chooses the k=0.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=10, d=4.\n\ng=4: k=2 → LCM is 24.\n\ng=2: k=0 → LCM is 30.\n\ng=1: k=0 → LCM is 60.\n\nSo, code chooses k=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=7, b=8 → d=1.\n\nOnly divisor is 1.\n\nrequired_k is (1 -7%1) mod1 →7 mod1 is 0 → k=0.\n\nSo, new_a=7, new_b=8. LCM is 56.\n\nBut what if k=1: a+1=8, b+1=9. LCM is 72.\n\nWhich is worse.\n\nSo, code returns 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about when a > b? Like a=10, b=6.\n\nThen, d=4, same as before.\n\nSo, the code is correct regardless of whether a is larger or smaller.\n\nBut wait, in the code, when a > b, does the computation still work?\n\nYes, because d is the absolute difference.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nAnother edge case: a=1, b=2.\n\nd=1.\n\nOnly divisor is 1.\n\nk=0.\n\nLCM(1,2)=2.\n\nWhat about k=1: 2 and 3 → LCM 6.\n\nNo, worse.\n\nSo, code returns 0.\n\nAnother edge case: a=999999937 (prime), b=999999938.\n\nd=1.\n\nSo, the only divisor is 1. So, k=0.\n\nBut a +k = 999999937, b +k=999999938.\n\nTheir GCD is 1. So, LCM is 999999937 * 999999938.\n\nWhich is a huge number.\n\nBut in this case, that's the minimal possible.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nBut what about a=1000000000, b=1000000001.\n\nd=1.\n\nk=0 is the only option.\n\nThus, the code handles it.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for each divisor g, I have to compute new_a and new_b, which could be very big (up to 2e9 + ...). But since the product is divided by the GCD, which could be up to d, which is up to 1e9, the multiplication could be up to (2e9)^2 = 4e18, which is manageable in Python as it handles big integers.\n\nBut for performance, it's acceptable because the number of divisors of d is at most around 2*sqrt(d), which is about 2e5 when d is 1e9.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the maximum number of divisors for a number up to 1e9 is 1024 (for 735134400 which has 1344 divisors). But for 1e9, it's much less. So, the code should run quickly.\n\nSo, the code is feasible.\n\nBut in the code, for each g in the divisors, the code computes the required_k and the current_lcm.\n\nWait, but in the code, the function 'get_divisors' returns a sorted list of divisors, but in the code, the loop is for g in divisors, and the order doesn't matter because we are looking for the minimal LCM.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n6 10 → output 2.\n\nAs we saw, code returns 2.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n21 31 → d=10.\n\ndivisors are 1,2,5,10.\n\nFor each g:\n\ng=1: k=0 → a=21, b=31 → LCM=21*31=651.\n\ng=2: a mod2=1 →k=1 → a+1=22, b+1=32 → GCD=2 → LCM= (22*32)/2= 352.\n\ng=5: a mod5=1 →k=4 →a+4=25, b+4=35 → GCD=5 → LCM= (25*35)/5= 175.\n\ng=10: a mod10=1 →k=9 →a+9=30, b+9=40 → GCD=10 → LCM= (30*40)/10= 120.\n\nSo, the minimal is 120, with k=9.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n5 10 → output 0.\n\nAs discussed, code returns 0.\n\nSo, all samples pass.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5 → output 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: a=4, b=6. d=2.\n\ndivisors are 1,2.\n\ng=1: k=0 → a=4, b=6 → LCM=12.\n\ng=2: a mod2=0 →k=0 → a=4, b=6 → GCD=2 → LCM= (4*6)/2=12.\n\nSo, both options give same LCM. So, the code will pick k=0, since it's the smallest.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, code is correct.\n\nThus, the final code should implement this logic.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nWe'll need to import math.\n\nBut the code must read from stdin, compute, and write to stdout.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nimport math\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nif a == b:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    d = abs(a - b)\n\n    # Function to get all divisors of d.\n\n    def get_divisors(n):\n\n        divisors = set()\n\n        for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) +1):\n\n            if n % i ==0:\n\n                divisors.add(i)\n\n                divisors.add(n//i)\n\n        return sorted(divisors)\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n\n    best_k = 0\n\n    for g in divisors:\n\n        rem = a % g\n\n        k = (g - rem) % g\n\n        new_a = a + k\n\n        new_b = b + k\n\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(new_a, new_b)\n\n        current_lcm = (new_a * new_b) // current_gcd\n\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and k < best_k):\n\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n            best_k = k\n\n    print(best_k)\n\nWait, but in the code, the function get_divisors returns a sorted list. But in the code, the loop is for g in divisors. The order of the loop doesn't affect the outcome because all possibilities are considered.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 6 10 → code returns 2.\n\nSample Input 2:21 31 → returns 9.\n\nSample Input 3:5 10 → returns 0.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=4, b=6 → returns 0.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=7 → d=4.\n\ndivisors: 1,2,4.\n\nFor g=4: a=3 mod4=3 →k=1 → new_a=4, new_b=8 → LCM=16.\n\nFor g=2: a mod2=1 →k=1 → new_a=4, new_b=8 → same as above.\n\nFor g=1: k=0 → new_a=3, new_b=7 → LCM=21.\n\nSo, minimal is 16, with k=1.\n\nSo code returns 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n",

If multiple \\( k \\) values yield the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nif a == b:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    d = abs(a - b)\n    \n    def get_divisors(n):\n        divisors = set()\n        for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                divisors.add(i)\n                divisors.add(n // i)\n        return sorted(divisors)\n    \n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0\n    \n    for g in divisors:\n        rem = a % g\n        k = (g - rem) % g\n        new_a = a + k\n        new_b = b + k\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(new_a, new_b)\n        current_lcm = (new_a * new_b) // current_gcd\n        \n        if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and k < best_k):\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k\n    \n    print(best_k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If \\( a \\) equals \\( b \\), the LCM is simply \\( a \\) (or \\( b \\)), so \\( k = 0 \\) is the answer.\n3. **Divisors Calculation**: The function `get_divisors` computes all divisors of \\( d \\) by iterating up to the square root of \\( d \\) and adding both the divisor and its complement.\n4. **Iterate Over Divisors**: For each divisor \\( g \\), compute the required \\( k \\) and evaluate the resulting LCM. Track the minimum LCM and the corresponding \\( k \\).\n5. **Output Result**: Print the smallest \\( k \\) that achieves the minimal LCM.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the optimal \\( k \\) by leveraging the properties of divisors and GCD, ensuring the solution is both correct and efficient.",
