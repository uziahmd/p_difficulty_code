He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output all those n's in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n, because there are usually more 2s than 5s. So each multiple of 5 contributes at least one zero. But also, multiples of higher powers like 25 contribute more. For example, 25 is 5^2, so it adds two zeros.\n\nSo the formula for calculating the number of trailing zeros is to sum n divided by 5, plus n divided by 25, plus n divided by 125, and so on until the division yields zero.\n\nBut wait, the problem is the reverse: given m, find all n where the count of trailing zeros equals m. How do I find these n's efficiently?\n\nI think I can use a binary search approach. Because the number of trailing zeros increases as n increases, so for a given m, there might be a range of n's that give exactly m zeros. Or maybe only a single n, or none.\n\nWait, no. Because when you increase n, the trailing zeros can stay the same for a range of numbers before it jumps again. For example, in the sample input, m=5. Let's see:\n\n5! is 120 → 1 zero.\n6! is 720 → 2 zeros?\nWait, wait no. Wait, 5! is 120 → 1 zero, right? Because 5*24 = 120, so one zero. Then 6! is 720, which ends with one zero? No, wait, 720 ends with one zero? Wait 720 is 72 followed by a zero. Oh right, yes. So 6! is 720 → 1 zero? Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, let me calculate:\n\n5! = 120 → 1 zero.\n6! = 720 → 1 zero as well. Because 720 ends with one zero.\nWait, no, 720 is 720, so one zero. Then 7! is 5040 → that's two zeros. So wait, how does that work?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-calculate:\n\nn | n! | trailing zeros\n5 | 120 → 1\n6 | 720 → 1\n7 | 5040 → 1 (no, wait 5040 ends with one zero? Or two? 5040 is 504 followed by a zero. So yes, one zero. Or wait, 5040 is 5040 → the last digit is zero, but the second last is 4. So only one zero. So 7! is 5040 → one zero. Wait, then why does the sample input say that for m=5, the answer is 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nWait, the sample input is '5' and the output is five numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Because each of their factorials has exactly 5 trailing zeros. Wait, no, because according to my calculations, 5! has 1, 6! has 1, etc. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the number of trailing zeros correctly. Let me do that.\n\nThe number of trailing zeros in n! is calculated as floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo for n=5: 5/5=1, 5/25=0 → total 1.\n\nn=6: same as 5, since 6/5 is 1, 6/25 is 0 → 1.\n\nn=10: 10/5=2, 10/25=0 → 2.\n\nn=15: 3 + 0 =3.\n\nn=20:4.\n\nn=25:25/5=5, 25/25=1 → 6.\n\nAh, okay. So for n=5 to n=9, the trailing zeros are 1. For n=10, it's 2.\n\nWait, but the sample input says m=5, and the output is 5,6,7,8,9. That doesn't align with my previous calculation. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample.\n\nWait, looking back: the sample input is ['1', '5'], which probably means two test cases: m=1 and m=5. The output for m=1 is 5,6,7,8,9. Wait, but according to my calculation, n=5 gives 1 zero, n=6 also 1, up to",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Additionally, we need to list all such \\( n \\) in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence from 1 to \\( n \\). Since 10 = 2 * 5 and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is essentially determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Counting Factors of 5**: The count of trailing zeros can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{count} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   This sum continues until the division yields zero.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: Given \\( m \\), we need to find the range of \\( n \\) values that yield exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Using binary search, we can efficiently determine the lower and upper bounds of \\( n \\) such that the count of trailing zeros equals \\( m \\).\n\n4. **Collecting Results**: Once the range is identified, collect all \\( n \\) values within this range and print them.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef find_ns(m):\n    left, right = 0, 5 * m  # Initial guess for upper bound\n    while count_trailing_zeros(right) < m:\n        right *= 2\n    # Binary search between left and right\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        cz = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if cz < m:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n    # Now left is the smallest n where cz >= m\n    # Check if left actually gives m\n    if count_trailing_zeros(left) != m:\n        return []\n    # Find the largest n where cz is m\n    max_n = left\n    while True:\n        next_n = max_n + 1\n        if count_trailing_zeros(next_n) > m:\n            break\n        max_n = next_n\n    # Now collect all n from left to max_n\n    result = list(range(left, max_n + 1))\n    return result\n\ndef main():\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m_list = input_line.split()\n    for m in m_list:\n        m = int(m)\n        ns = find_ns(m)\n        if not ns:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            print(len(ns))\n            print(' '.join(map(str, ns)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function `count_trailing_zeros(n)`**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) by summing the contributions of multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc.\n\n2. **Function `find_ns(m)`**: This function uses binary search to determine the range of \\( n \\) values that yield exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. It starts with an initial estimate for the upper bound and narrows down the range using binary search.\n\n3. **Main Function**: Reads input, processes each test case, and prints the results. If no valid \\( n \\) exists for a given \\( m \\), it prints 0; otherwise, it prints the count followed by the sorted list of valid \\( n \\) values.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the required \\( n \\) values using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of \\( m \\).",
