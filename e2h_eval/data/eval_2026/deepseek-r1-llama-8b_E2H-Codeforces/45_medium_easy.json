There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tennis tournament. Let's break down the problem and think about how to approach it.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem statement again. The tournament is a knockout style, which means each game results in one player being eliminated. The winner continues until they lose. But there's a specific rule here: two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. So, for example, if a player has played 2 games, they can only face someone who has played 1 or 2 games.\n\nOur goal is to determine the maximum number of games the winner (let's say player 1) can play, given n players.\n\nHmm. So, what's the strategy here? I think it's about structuring the tournament so that player 1 can play as many games as possible by strategically choosing opponents in a way that satisfies the rule.\n\nLet me think about small examples to get a pattern.\n\nFor n=2: Only one game. So the answer is 1.\n\nFor n=3: Player 1 can play against two players. How? In the first round, player 1 plays against someone (say player 2). Then in the next round, player 1 plays against player 3. Each time, the difference in the number of games played is 0 or 1. Because after the first game, player 1 has 1 game, so the opponent in the next round must have 0 or 1. Since player 3 hasn't played any games yet, it's allowed. So total games for winner is 2.\n\nWait, but wait. How does that work with the tournament structure? Let's see: Initially, three players. They need to be arranged in a grid. Maybe something like:\n\nRound 1: 1 vs 2, 3 vs ... Wait, no, with three players, it's not straightforward. Oh right, in a knockout tournament, the initial rounds might require some byes.\n\nBut maybe it's better to model this as a binary tree. Each game is a node, and the leaves are the players. The winner climbs up the tree, accumulating the number of games they've played.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is needed. Let's think recursively. For each step, the winner needs to have an opponent whose number of games played is either equal to theirs or one less.\n\nSo, the maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by how the tournament is structured. We need to arrange the other players in such a way that the winner can always find an opponent who has played either the same number or one fewer games than them.\n\nHmm. So, the problem reduces to finding the longest possible path for the winner, given the constraints on their opponents' game counts.\n\nI recall a similar problem where the maximum number of wins is found based on the Fibonacci sequence. Maybe that's the case here too.\n\nWait, thinking back, there was a problem where you had to find the maximum number of matches a champion can win, given certain conditions on the number of losses others have. That used the Fibonacci-like approach.\n\nIn our case, perhaps the maximum number of games is the largest k such that the sum of the first k Fibonacci numbers is less than or equal to n.\n\nWait, let me think. The Fibonacci sequence starts with F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, etc. Maybe the maximum number of games is related to the Fibonacci numbers.\n\nAlternatively, let's model the problem as building a binary tree where each internal node represents a game, and the leaves are the players. The winner must climb from the leaf through the internal nodes, each time ensuring that the current game's opponent has a game count differing by at most one.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of games is the largest m such that the sum of the series (1, 2, 3, ..., m) is less than or equal to n.\n\nWait, no. Because in each round, the number of games is limited by the structure. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that each time the winner plays a game, the opponent must have a game count that is either equal or one less. So, the opponent's count could be the same as the winner's, meaning the opponent also has a high number of games.\n\nSo, to maximize the number of games, the winner should play against opponents who have played as many games as possible, but just one less or equal.\n\nThis feels like a problem where the maximum number of games is the largest m such that the sum of the first m terms of a certain sequence is <= n.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of games is the largest m where the (m+1)th Fibonacci number is greater than n. Or something along those lines.\n\nLet me try some examples:\n\nSample Input 1: n=2. Output is 1.\n\nSample Input 2: n=3. Output is 2.\n\nSample Input 3: n=4. Output is 2.\n\nSample Input 4: n=10. Output is 4.\n\nWait, let's see for n=10. How?\n\nIf the maximum is 4, then the structure would be such that the winner plays 4 games. Each time, their opponent has played either 3, 2, 1, 0 games.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in each game, the opponent can have at most one less than the number of games the winner has played.\n\nSo, for the first game, the winner has 0 games, so the opponent can have 0. So that's allowed.\n\nSecond game: the winner has 1, so opponent can have 0 or 1.\n\nThird game: winner has 2, so opponent can have 1 or 2.\n\nFourth game: winner has 3, so opponent can have 2 or 3.\n\nSo, for four games, the winner's opponents have played 0, 0, 1, 2 games respectively. Hmm, not sure.\n\nBut how does this translate into the total number of players required?\n\nEach game the winner plays adds one more to the opponent's game count, but perhaps the structure is such that each step requires a certain number of players.\n\nAlternatively, let's model the minimum number of players required for the winner to play m games.\n\nLet's say the winner plays m games. For each game, the opponent must have a certain number of games played. Let's denote f(k) as the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games.\n\nFor k=1: the opponent must have 0 games. So, the minimal setup is 2 players. So f(1)=2.\n\nFor k=2: the opponent in the second game must have either 1 or 0 games.\n\nWait, in the first game, the winner has played 1 game. So the second opponent must have 0 or 1 games. If the second opponent has 0, that means they haven't played before. So, the first opponent could have been someone else.\n\nWait, perhaps f(k) is the sum of the first k terms of a certain sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2) + 1. Or maybe f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2) + something.\n\nWait, let's think for each k:\n\nk=1: needs 2 players (f(1)=2).\n\nk=2: To have the winner play 2 games, they need to have two opponents. The first opponent has 0 games, the second can have 0 or 1. But the second opponent's game count depends on how the previous game went.\n\nWait, maybe for each step, the number of players required is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2) + 1. Or perhaps f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2) - 1.\n\nWait, let's try computing f(k) for small k.\n\nf(1) = 2.\n\nFor k=2: the winner plays two games. The first game is against someone who hasn't played (0 games). The second game is against someone who has 0 or 1 games. But if the second opponent has 0, then the total players needed would be 3 (winner, opponent1, opponent2). But perhaps the optimal arrangement is to have the second opponent have 1 game, which would imply that in the first round, another game happened between two other players.\n\nWait, perhaps for k=2, the minimal number of players is 3.\n\nBecause the first opponent has 0, the second can have 0 or 1. If the second has 1, that means there's another player (player 3) who played against someone else. So, for the second game, the winner has 1 game, and the opponent has 1. So the setup requires 3 players.\n\nSo f(2)=3.\n\nFor k=3: the third game's opponent must have 2 games.\n\nSo how many players are needed? Let's see:\n\nWe have the winner, opponent1 (for game 1), opponent2 (for game 2, who has 1 game), and opponent3 (for game 3, who must have 2 games).\n\nOpponent3 has 2 games, so that means they won two games. How did that happen?\n\nOpponent3 must have beaten two other players. So, for that, we need two more players: let's say player4 and player5.\n\nSo the total players are 1 (winner) + 3 (opponents1,2,3) + 2 (for opponent3's previous games) = 6 players?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(k) is the (k+2)th Fibonacci number minus 1 or something like that.\n\nWait, another approach: for each game the winner plays, the number of players required increases in a way that forms a Fibonacci sequence.\n\nLet me see. Let's say that to have the winner play m games, the minimal number of players required is fib(m+2) - 1, where fib is the Fibonacci sequence starting with fib(1)=1, fib(2)=1, fib(3)=2, etc.\n\nWait, let's test this:\n\nFor m=1: fib(3) -1 = 2-1=1. But earlier we thought that for m=1, you need 2 players. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's fib(m+2) -1, but perhaps the starting indices are different.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nm | required players\n--- | ---\n1 | 2\n2 | 3\n3 | 5\n4 | 8\n\nWait, 2,3,5,8... these are Fibonacci numbers. So 2 is fib(4) (if fib starts at 1, 2,3,5, etc.), 3 is fib(5), 5 is fib(6), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of players needed is fib(m+2) -1.\n\nWait, for m=1: fib(3) is 2, so 2-1=1. No, but we need 2 players.\n\nHmm, maybe the formula is fib(m+3)-1.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nm=1: fib(4)=3 → 3-1=2. Correct.\n\nm=2: fib(5)=5 →5-1=4. But earlier for m=2, we thought that 3 players are sufficient. Hmm, maybe this isn't the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of players is fib(m+2) -1.\n\nWait, for m=1: fib(3)=2 → 2-1=1. Not enough.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think recursively. Suppose the winner plays m games. Then, for the m-th game, the opponent must have played either m-1 or m-2 games, because the winner has played m games.\n\nWait, no. Because the rule says that two players can play only if their game counts differ by at most one. So, when the winner is playing their m-th game, the opponent must have either m-1 or m-2 games.\n\nWait, no, because the winner has played m games, so the opponent can have at most m-1. Because the difference can't be more than one.\n\nWait, for the m-th game of the winner, the opponent must have played either m-1 or m-2 games.\n\nWait, no. Because the difference can be at most one. So, if the winner has played k games, the opponent can have k-1 or k games.\n\nWait, but the opponent's game count is determined by their previous games.\n\nHmm, perhaps the opponent in the m-th game of the winner must have played exactly m-1 games. Because if the opponent had played m-2, that might not allow the winner to have played m games.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of players required for m games is the sum of the Fibonacci sequence up to m steps.\n\nWait, let's try to model the minimal number of players required for m games.\n\nLet’s denote f(m) as the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play m games.\n\nFor m=1: the winner plays one game against another player. So f(1) = 2.\n\nFor m=2: the winner must play two games. The first game is against someone with 0 games, then the second against someone with 0 or 1. If the second opponent has 1 game, that implies that in the first round, another game was played between two players. So, the total players needed are 1 (winner) + 2 (first opponent) + 1 (second opponent's opponent) = 4? Or maybe not.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the structure.\n\nTo have the winner play two games:\n\nGame 1: winner (0 games) vs A (0 games). Now winner has 1 game, A is out.\n\nGame 2: winner (1 game) vs B (0 games). Now winner has 2 games, B is out.\n\nSo, total players: 3 (winner, A, B). So f(2) =3.\n\nFor m=3:\n\nGame 3: winner has 2 games. Opponent must have 1 or 2.\n\nOption 1: opponent has 1 game.\n\nHow to arrange that:\n\nIn the third game, the winner plays against C, who has 1 game.\n\nSo, C must have beaten someone else. So, in the first round, C played against D, who has 0 games.\n\nThen, in the second round, C (with 1 game) plays against the winner (with 2 games).\n\nSo, the players involved are: winner, A, B, C, D. So total 5 players. But wait, maybe some can be reused.\n\nWait, in the first game, winner vs A (A is out). Second game, winner vs B (B is out). Third game, winner vs C (C has 1 game). But how did C get to 1 game? C must have beaten D in a previous game. So D is out.\n\nThus, the players are winner, A, B, C, D: 5 players.\n\nSo f(3) =5.\n\nWait, but 5 is larger than 3, which is f(2). So for m=3, f(3)=5.\n\nSimilarly, for m=4:\n\nThe fourth game's opponent must have played 3 games.\n\nHow?\n\nIn the fourth game, the winner has 3 games, so the opponent must have 2 or 3.\n\nAssuming the opponent has 3 games: but that's not possible unless the opponent has played 3 games. So, the opponent must have 3 games.\n\nSo, the opponent E has played 3 games. That means E has beaten three players: F, G, H.\n\nSo, adding E, F, G, H. So the total players now are 1 (winner) + 3 (A, B, C) + 3 (D, E, F, G, H)? Wait, no.\n\nWait, let me retrace.\n\nAfter three games:\n\nPlayers used: winner, A, B, C, D.\n\nNow, for the fourth game, the winner (3 games) plays against E (3 games). How does E get to 3 games?\n\nE must have beaten three players in prior games.\n\nSo, E's first game: E vs F (F is out). E has 1 game.\n\nE's second game: E (1) vs G (0 or 1). Suppose G has 0, then E plays against G, now E has 2.\n\nE's third game: E (2) vs H (1 or 2). Suppose H has 1, then E has 3.\n\nSo, the players involved are: F, G, H.\n\nSo, the total players used are winner, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. That's 9 players.\n\nSo f(4)=9.\n\nWait, but wait, in the third game, the winner has 2 games, and the opponent is C (who had 1 game). So, C must have come from a game where C played against D (so D is out). So, the players are winner, A, B, C, D.\n\nThen, the fourth game is between winner (3) and E (3). So, E must have played 3 games, which required F, G, H.\n\nSo total players: 1 (winner) + 4 (A,B,C,D) + 4 (E,F,G,H) = 9.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo f(m) for m=1,2,3,4 is 2,3,5,9.\n\nLooking at these numbers, they seem to follow a pattern where each term is the sum of the previous two terms plus something.\n\nWait, 2,3,5,9.\n\nFrom 2 to 3: +1.\n\n3 to5: +2.\n\n5 to9: +4.\n\nWhich looks like powers of two.\n\nWait, 1, 2, 4, 8. Hmm, but 2 is 2^1, 3 is 2+1, 5 is 4+1, 9 is 8+1.\n\nWait, perhaps f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2) + 1?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nf(1) = 2.\n\nf(2) = f(1) + f(0) +1? What's f(0)? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2) + something else.\n\nWait, for m=3, f(3)=5. Which is 3+2=5.\n\nWait, 3 is f(2)=3, 2 is f(1)+1=2+1=3? No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2) +1.\n\nCheck:\n\nf(1)=2.\n\nf(2)= f(1)+f(0)+1. Wait, but I don't know f(0).\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a different recurrence.\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n\nm | f(m)\n1 | 2\n2 | 3\n3 | 5\n4 | 9\n\nHmm, 2,3,5,9. The differences are 1,2,4. These are doubling each time.\n\nWait, 1, 2, 4, 8,... but 1+2=3, +4=7, which is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of players for m games is equal to the sum of the first m Fibonacci numbers plus 1.\n\nWait, Fibonacci sequence starting as F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, etc.\n\nSum for m=1: F(1)=1 → 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nm=2: F(1)+F(2)=1+1=2 → 2+1=3. Correct.\n\nm=3: 1+1+2=4 →4+1=5. Correct.\n\nm=4: 1+1+2+3=7 →7+2=9. Wait, 7+2=9? No, 7+2=9. So 7+2=9. Yes.\n\nSo the formula seems to be f(m) = (sum of first m Fibonacci numbers) + (something). Wait, no.\n\nWait, sum of first m Fibonacci numbers is S(m) = F(1)+F(2)+...+F(m).\n\nFor m=1: S=1 → f(m)=2=1+1.\n\nFor m=2: S=2 → f(m)=3=2+1.\n\nFor m=3: S=4 → f(m)=5=4+1.\n\nFor m=4: S=7 → f(m)=9=7+2.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(m) = 2*S(m-1) +1.\n\nWait, for m=1: 2*0+1=1. No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(m) is the (m+2)th Fibonacci number minus 1.\n\nWait, Fibonacci sequence:\n\nF(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, F(6)=8, F(7)=13, F(8)=21.\n\nFor m=1: F(3)=2 → 2-1=1. Not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps it's F(m+2) -1.\n\nFor m=1: F(3)-1=2-1=1 → no.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(m) follows the pattern where each term is the sum of the previous two terms plus 1.\n\nLike:\n\nf(1) =2.\n\nf(2)=3 =2+1.\n\nf(3)=5=3+2.\n\nf(4)=9=5+4.\n\nWait, 2,3,5,9: the increments are 1,2,4. So the next increment would be 8, leading to 17.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of players for m games is the (m+2)th term in a modified Fibonacci sequence.\n\nBut regardless of the exact formula, the key idea is that for the winner to play m games, the minimal number of players required is f(m), which grows exponentially.\n\nSo, for a given n, we need to find the largest m such that f(m) ≤ n.\n\nOnce we find m, that's the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Precompute f(m) for various m until f(m) exceeds the maximum possible n (1018).\n\n2. For a given n, find the largest m where f(m) ≤n.\n\nBut how do we compute f(m)?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(m) can be computed using a loop, starting from m=1, and calculating f(m) as f(m-1) + f(m-2) +1.\n\nWait, for m=1:2.\n\nm=2: 2 +1=3.\n\nm=3:3+2=5.\n\nm=4:5+3=8. But earlier calculation said f(4)=9. So discrepancy.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's not the correct recurrence.\n\nWait, perhaps f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2) + something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of players for m games is f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2) + 1.\n\nWait, let's test.\n\nm=1:2.\n\nm=2:2 + (f(0)+1?) Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(m) = f(m-1) + (f(m-2) +1).\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps for each m, the minimal number of players is the sum of the first m terms of a certain series, perhaps the Fibonacci series plus 1.\n\nWait, considering the earlier examples:\n\nm=1: 2 → 2 = 1×2.\n\nm=2: 3 → 3= 2+1.\n\nm=3:5 → 5= 3+2.\n\nm=4:9 → 5+4=9.\n\nSo the pattern is that each term is the sum of the previous two terms plus 0 for the first term.\n\nWait, the terms are 2,3,5,9,17,...\n\nSo 2,3,5,9,17,...\n\nThe differences are 1,2,4,8, which are 2^(m-1), where m starts at 1.\n\nWait, for m=1: difference is 1=2^0.\n\nm=2: difference is 2=2^1.\n\nm=3: difference is4=2^2.\n\nm=4: difference is8=2^3.\n\nSo the recurrence seems to be f(m) = f(m-1) + 2^(m-1).\n\nYes! Let's see:\n\nf(1) =2.\n\nf(2)=f(1) + 2^(2-1) =2+2=4. But earlier calculation said f(2)=3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps the recurrence is f(m) = f(m-1) + 2^(m-1) -1.\n\nWait, for m=2: f(2) =2 + 2^1 -1=2+2-1=3. Correct.\n\nm=3: f(3)=3 +4-1=6. But earlier, f(3)=5. So no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(m) = f(m-1) + 2^{m-1} -1.\n\nWait, m=2: 2 + 2-1=3. Correct.\n\nm=3:3 +4-1=6. But earlier calculation for m=3 required 5 players. So discrepancy.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of players for m games is the sum of 2^(k) for k from 0 to m-1.\n\nWait, for m=1: 2^0=1 → 1. No.\n\nBut in our earlier cases, m=1 requires 2 players, which is 2^1.\n\nSo perhaps the sum is 2^m.\n\nBut for m=1:2=2^1.\n\nm=2: 2+2=4, but earlier f(2)=3. So no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(m) = 2^(m+1) - something.\n\nWait, m=1:2=2^2-2.\n\nm=2:3=2^2-1.\n\nm=3:5=2^3-3.\n\nm=4:9=2^4-7.\n\nHmm, not seeing a pattern.\n\nMaybe it's easier to precompute f(m) for each m, and for each m, compute the minimal number of players required, and see if the pattern holds.\n\nBut perhaps the correct approach is to model f(m) as the sum of the first m terms of a sequence where each term is the sum of the previous two terms plus 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of players required for the winner to play m games is f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2) +1.\n\nTesting this:\n\nf(1)=2.\n\nf(2)= f(1)+f(0)+1. But f(0) is undefined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(0) is considered as 1.\n\nSo f(2) =2 +1 +1=4. But earlier, for m=2, 3 players are sufficient. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(m) = f(m-1) + (f(m-2) +1).\n\nWait:\n\nm=1:2.\n\nm=2:2 + (1+1)=4. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is not working.\n\nAlternative plan: Instead of trying to find a formula, perhaps simulate the process.\n\nWe can model the minimal number of players required for m games as follows.\n\nFor each game m, the opponent must have played either m-1 or m-2 games. Wait, no. Because the opponent's game count is based on the structure of their own path.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of players is the sum of the first m terms of a sequence where each term is the sum of the previous two.\n\nWait, for m=1:1.\n\nm=2:1+1=2.\n\nm=3:1+1+2=4.\n\nm=4:1+1+2+3=7.\n\nBut that doesn't fit our earlier examples.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of players is f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2) + 1, but with f(1)=2, f(2)=3.\n\nSo:\n\nf(1)=2.\n\nf(2)=3.\n\nf(3)=3+2+1=6. But earlier, for m=3, we needed 5 players.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the minimal number of players for m games is the (m+2)th Fibonacci number minus 1.\n\nWait, let's check.\n\nFibonacci sequence starting with F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, F(6)=8, F(7)=13, F(8)=21.\n\nFor m=1: F(3)=2 → 2-1=1. No.\n\nm=2: F(4)=3 →3-1=2. But earlier, m=2 needs 3 players.\n\nNo, that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm stuck on this part. Let's think differently.\n\nSuppose the winner plays m games. Each game after the first must have an opponent whose number of games is either one less or equal to the winner's current count.\n\nBut to maximize the number of games, the winner should choose opponents in a way that allows the maximum possible number of subsequent games.\n\nSo, the structure of the tournament can be viewed as a binary tree where each internal node represents a game, and the leaves are the players. The winner's path from the root to the leaf is the sequence of games they play.\n\nEach game must satisfy the condition that the two players have game counts differing by at most one.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the longest possible path in this binary tree, given n leaves.\n\nThis is similar to finding the height of a binary tree with n leaves, but with certain constraints on the branching.\n\nIn a normal binary tree, the maximum depth is log2(n). But here, the structure may be more constrained.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of games is the largest m such that the (m+1)th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to n.\n\nWait, let's test this with sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1: n=2.\n\nFind the largest m where Fib(m+1) ≤2.\n\nFib sequence:\n\nF(1)=1.\n\nF(2)=1.\n\nF(3)=2.\n\nF(4)=3.\n\nF(5)=5.\n\nSo for m=1: F(2)=1 ≤2.\n\nm=2: F(3)=2 ≤2.\n\nSo the maximum m is 2.\n\nWait, but sample input 1 expects output 1.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct condition is that the sum of the first m Fibonacci numbers is less than or equal to n.\n\nWait, for sample input 1: n=2.\n\nSum for m=1:1 ≤2.\n\nm=2:1+1=2 ≤2.\n\nSo maximum m=2, but sample output is 1.\n\nHmm, no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of games is the largest m such that Fib(m+2) ≤n.\n\nSample input 1: Fib(3)=2 ≤2 → m=1.\n\nSample input 2: n=3.\n\nFib(4)=3 ≤3 → m=2.\n\nSample input 3: n=4.\n\nFib(5)=5>4. So m=3 is not possible. So m=2.\n\nSample input 4: n=10.\n\nFib(6)=8 ≤10. Fib(7)=13>10. So m=5?\n\nWait, but sample output is 4.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum m is the largest number where Fib(m+2) ≤n.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSample 1: n=2 → Fib(3)=2 → m=1.\n\nSample 2: n=3 → Fib(4)=3 → m=2.\n\nSample 3: n=4 → Fib(5)=5>4 → m=2.\n\nSample 4: n=10 → Fib(6)=8 ≤10, Fib(7)=13>10 → m=4.\n\nWait, sample 4's output is 4, which matches.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum number of games is the largest m such that Fib(m+2) ≤n.\n\nWait, let's test another case.\n\nFor n=5:\n\nFib(5)=5 → m=3 (since Fib(5)=5 ≤5, Fib(6)=8>5.\n\nSo maximum m=3.\n\nWhat's the minimal number of players for m=3? According to earlier calculations, 5 players.\n\nWhich is exactly Fib(5)=5.\n\nSo yes, 5 players are needed for 3 games.\n\nAnother test: n=6.\n\nFib(6)=8>6. So m=4, since Fib(6)=8>6. Wait, wait:\n\nWait, Fib(5)=5 ≤6 → m=3.\n\nWait, no: Fib(5)=5, which is ≤6.\n\nFib(6)=8>6. So m=3.\n\nBut what's the maximum games possible for n=6?\n\nWell, according to the formula, m=3.\n\nBut let's think: can the winner play 3 games.\n\nYes, because 5 players are needed, which is ≤6.\n\nSo for n=6, the answer is 3.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nCompute the Fibonacci sequence up to a point where Fib(k) ≤n. The maximum number of games is the largest m where Fib(m+2) ≤n.\n\nWait, but in the sample input 3, n=4.\n\nFib(5)=5>4. So m is the largest where Fib(m+2) ≤4.\n\nFib(4)=3 ≤4.\n\nFib(5)=5>4.\n\nSo m=2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n1. Generate the Fibonacci sequence until Fib(k) exceeds n.\n\n2. For each k, compute m =k-2.\n\n3. Find the largest m where Fib(k) ≤n.\n\nBut wait, the Fibonacci sequence here starts with Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, etc.\n\nSo for each m, we need to find the maximum m where Fib(m+2) ≤n.\n\nSo the steps in code would be:\n\n- Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the point where Fib(k) >n.\n\n- For each k, keep track of the maximum m where Fib(m+2) ≤n.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe can generate the Fibonacci sequence until Fib(k) >n.\n\nFor each Fib(k), if k >=2, then m =k-2.\n\nWe keep track of the maximum m.\n\nFor example, for n=10:\n\nFib(6)=8 ≤10 → m=4.\n\nFib(7)=13>10 → stop.\n\nSo m=4.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test: n=5.\n\nFib(5)=5 → m=3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code will look like:\n\nRead n.\n\nGenerate Fib until Fib(k) >n.\n\nFor each Fib(k), if k >=2, compute m=k-2.\n\nKeep track of the maximum m.\n\nFinally, output the maximum m.\n\nWait, but what about n=1? But the problem states n>=2.\n\nSo, let's proceed.\n\nImplementing this in Python:\n\nWe can start with Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, etc.\n\nLoop until Fib(k) >n.\n\nFor each Fib(k), if k>=2, m =k-2.\n\nUpdate max_m if Fib(k)<=n.\n\nSo, code:\n\nn = int(input())\nfib = [1, 1]\nmax_m = 0\ncurrent_fib = 2  # Fib(3)\nwhile True:\n    if current_fib > n:\n        break\n    if current_fib >=2:\n        m = current_fib -2\n        if m > max_m:\n            max_m = m\n    fib.append(current_fib *2 + fib[-2])  # Wait, no. Wait, the next Fib is Fib(k+1) = Fib(k) + Fib(k-1).\n    # Correction: next_fib = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n    next_fib = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n    if next_fib > n:\n        break\n    fib.append(next_fib)\n    current_fib = next_fib\nprint(max_m)\n\nWait, but initial fib is [1,1], which are Fib(1) and Fib(2). Then, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should be:\n\nfib_sequence = [1, 1]\n\nmax_m = 0\n\nfor k in range(len(fib_sequence), 1000):\n    next_val = fib_sequence[k-1] + fib_sequence[k-2]\n    if next_val >n:\n        break\n    fib_sequence.append(next_val)\n    if k >=2:\n        m = k-2\n        if m > max_m:\n            max_m = m\n\nWait, but in this case, the indices might be off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given that two players can only face each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the problem can be modeled using the Fibonacci sequence. The maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by finding the largest number `m` such that the (m+2)th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to the number of players `n`.\n\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The minimal number of players required for the winner to play `m` games follows a pattern related to the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, the number of players needed for `m` games is given by the (m+2)th Fibonacci number.\n2. **Iterative Calculation**: We generate the Fibonacci sequence iteratively until the next value exceeds `n`. For each generated Fibonacci number, we check if it fits within `n` and update the maximum number of games accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nfib_sequence = [1, 1]\nmax_games = 0\n\nfor k in range(2, n + 1):\n    next_fib = fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2]\n    if next_fib > n:\n        break\n    if (k - 2) > max_games:\n        max_games = k - 2\n    fib_sequence.append(next_fib)\n\nprint(max_games)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n`, representing the number of players.\n2. **Fibonacci Sequence Initialization**: We initialize the Fibonacci sequence with the first two values, both set to 1.\n3. **Generating Fibonacci Numbers**: We iterate through generating the next Fibonacci number in the sequence. For each new Fibonacci number, we check if it exceeds `n`. If it does, we stop the iteration.\n4. **Updating Maximum Games**: For each valid Fibonacci number (i.e., those that do not exceed `n`), we determine the maximum number of games by checking if the current index minus 2 yields a higher value than the current maximum.\n5. **Output Result**: Finally, we print the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of `n = 1018`.",
