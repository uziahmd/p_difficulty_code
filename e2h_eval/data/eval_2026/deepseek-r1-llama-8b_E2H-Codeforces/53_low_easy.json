Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem correctly. The task is to find the maximum possible length of a substring that occurs two or more times in the input string. The occurrences can overlap. For example, in the sample input 'ababa', the substring 'aba' appears twice, overlapping each other. So the output is 3.\n\nLet me consider some examples. If the input is 'abcd', all substrings are unique, so the answer is 0. For 'zzz', the substrings 'zz' and 'zz' appear (overlapping), so the answer is 2.\n\nSo the approach is to check all possible substrings of the string, starting from the longest possible, and see if any of them appears more than once. Once I find such a substring, I can return its length as the answer.\n\nHow do I efficiently find this? Well, since the string length is up to 100, a brute-force approach might be feasible here.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate over possible substring lengths, starting from the largest possible down to 1.\n   - The maximum possible substring length is len(s) - 1, but wait, no, it's actually len(s) because a substring can be the entire string. Wait, but for a substring to appear at least twice, it must have a length less than the entire string. Because if the entire string is considered, it can't appear more than once. So the maximum possible length to check is len(s)-1.\n\nWait, for example, if the string is 'aaa', the entire string is 'aaa' which appears only once. But substrings like 'aa' appear twice. So the maximum possible length to check is len(s)-1, because the longest possible substring that can appear at least twice is when it's one character shorter than the full string.\n\nSo, for each possible length L, starting from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\n   For each possible starting index i in 0 to len(s)-L:\n\n      Extract the substring s[i:i+L]\n\n      Check if this substring appears again in the string, possibly overlapping.\n\n      How to check this? One way is to scan the entire string for any occurrence of this substring, starting from i+1 onwards.\n\nIf for any L we find such a substring, then the answer is L.\n\nOnce we find the maximum L for which this is true, we return it.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n   - For each i in 0 to len(s)-L:\n       - substr = s[i:i+L]\n       - Check if substr appears again in s[i+1: ...] (i.e., after position i)\n   - If any substr satisfies this, return L.\n\nIf no such L is found, return 0.\n\nBut wait, what's the time complexity here?\n\nThe outer loop runs len(s) times. For each L, the inner loop runs (n-L+1) times. For each substr, checking if it appears again in the string can take O(n) time in the worst case. So overall, it's O(n^3), which for n=100 is manageable (1e6 operations).\n\nThat's acceptable for the constraints given.\n\nSo now, how to implement this.\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nRead the input string.\n\nLoop L from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\n   For each possible starting index i (0 <= i <= len(s)-L):\n\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n       Check if there exists a j > i such that s[j:j+L] == substr.\n\n       If yes, then return L.\n\nIf no L is found, return 0.\n\nSo in code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n    for i in range(len(s) - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        # Now check if this substr appears again after i\n        for j in range(i+1, len(s) - L + 1):\n            if s[j:j+L] == substr:\n                print(L)\n                exit()\n# If no such substring found, print 0\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but wait. Let's test this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abcd'\n\nCheck L=3:\n\nFor i=0: substr 'abc' → check j=1: 'bcd' → not equal. j=2: beyond string. So no.\n\ni=1: substr 'bcd' → j=2: 'cd' → not same.\n\nSimilarly for L=2:\n\nCheck each substr of length 2.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the maximum length of a substring that appears at least twice in the input string. These occurrences can overlap.\n2. **Iterate Over Substring Lengths**: Start checking from the longest possible substring length down to 1. This ensures that we find the maximum length as early as possible.\n3. **Check Each Substring**: For each length, generate all possible substrings and check if any of them appear more than once in the string.\n4. **Efficiency Consideration**: Given the constraints (string length up to 100), a brute-force approach is feasible. This involves checking each possible substring of each possible length.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\nfor L in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        for j in range(i + 1, n - L + 1):\n            if s[j:j+L] == substr:\n                print(L)\n                exit()\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and its length is determined.\n2. **Loop Over Possible Lengths**: Starting from the longest possible substring length (which is one less than the string length) down to 1.\n3. **Generate Substrings**: For each length, generate all possible substrings starting from each position in the string.\n4. **Check for Duplicates**: For each generated substring, check if it appears again in the string starting from the next position. If a duplicate is found, print the length and exit.\n5. **Handle Edge Cases**: If no such substring is found after checking all lengths, print 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest repeating substring by leveraging a brute-force method, which is suitable given the problem constraints.",
