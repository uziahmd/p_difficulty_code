The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and I need to figure out the best approach. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about selecting which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of their fans is maximized. Each district's fan count is 2^i, where i is the district number. The president wants to remove k contestants, but after removal, all remaining must be reachable from each other. So, the goal is to find which k districts to remove to maximize the sum.\n\nHmm, so the key here is to find a subtree (since it's a tree structure) that includes as many high-value nodes as possible. Since 2^i grows exponentially with i, higher-numbered districts contribute more to the sum. So, probably, we want to keep the highest possible districts and remove as many lower ones as needed, but ensuring the tree remains connected.\n\nWait, but the tree is given as an undirected graph. So, the idea might be to find a subtree where all the kept districts are in such a way that their removal doesn't disconnect the rest. Or wait, no—after removing k districts, the remaining should form a connected subgraph. So, the problem reduces to selecting a connected induced subgraph of size n-k, with maximum sum of 2^i for the included nodes. Because each removed node contributes nothing, and the rest must form a connected component.\n\nSo, the main task is to select a subset of nodes S, with |S|=n-k, such that S induces a connected subgraph, and the sum of 2^i for i in S is as large as possible.\n\nGiven that n can be up to 1e6, we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nSince 2^i increases with i, the optimal strategy is to include as many higher-numbered districts as possible. So, the best connected subgraph would consist of the largest possible districts, starting from the highest, while ensuring that they form a connected tree.\n\nWait, but the tree is connected, so any subset of nodes that forms a connected subgraph will have exactly one spanning tree. So, perhaps the approach is to find the minimal number of nodes to remove so that the remaining form a connected subtree that includes the maximum possible higher-numbered nodes.\n\nWait, another angle: For each node, if it's part of the final tree, then all its descendants in the tree must also be included? Or maybe not. Because perhaps including a lower node allows higher nodes elsewhere. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal structure is a path that starts from some node and goes down, but that might not capture all possibilities.\n\nWait, considering the nature of the problem, since 2^i is so weighted towards higher i, the optimal solution is to include all the highest possible nodes, ensuring that they form a connected component.\n\nSo, the plan is to select the top m nodes (where m = n -k), such that these m nodes form a connected subgraph. But how to determine which m nodes to pick?\n\nWait, but the tree is arbitrary. So, the selection of nodes needs to form a connected subtree. The question is, which subtree of size m gives the maximum sum.\n\nBut considering the exponential weight, the best is to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible. So, perhaps the optimal subtree is formed by selecting the m nodes with the highest indices, and then checking if they form a connected subtree. If they do, then that's our answer. If not, we may need to remove some lower nodes.\n\nWait, but how do we find the minimal set of nodes to remove to make the top m nodes connected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem reduces to finding a subtree that includes as many of the highest-numbered nodes as possible, and ensuring that the subtree is connected.\n\nLet me think about the example given:\n\nSample Input 1:\n6 3\n2 1\n2 6\n4 2\n5 6\n2 3\n\nSo, n=6, k=3. We need to remove 3 districts. The sample output is to remove 1,3,4. The remaining districts are 2,5,6. Their sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 +32 +64 = 100.\n\nIf we look at the tree structure:\n\nLooking at the edges:\n\nEdges are between 2-1, 2-6, 2-4, 2-3, 6-5.\n\nSo the tree looks like:\n\n2 is connected to 1,3,4,6. 6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo, the initial structure is that 2 is the central node. Now, the kept nodes are 2,5,6.\n\nWait, but 5 is connected via 6, which is connected to ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected component with the maximum possible total number of fans. Each district's fan count is \\(2^i\\), where \\(i\\) is the district number. The goal is to maximize the sum of these fan counts after removing \\(k\\) districts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure Insight**: The given districts form a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two districts. To ensure the remaining districts are connected, we need to find a subtree that includes as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n2. **Maximizing Fan Count**: Since \\(2^i\\) grows exponentially with \\(i\\), higher-numbered districts contribute more to the total fan count. Thus, we aim to keep the highest possible districts and remove lower-numbered ones.\n3. **Greedy Strategy**: We use a greedy approach to determine the minimal set of nodes to remove. We start from the highest-numbered district and move downwards, ensuring that each district included in the final set forms a connected subtree.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for _ in range(n-1):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n    \n    parent = [0]*(n+1)\n    children = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    visited = [False]*(n+1)\n    stack = [1]\n    visited[1] = True\n    while stack:\n        u = stack.pop()\n        for v in edges[u]:\n            if not visited[v]:\n                visited[v] = True\n                parent[v] = u\n                children[u].append(v)\n                stack.append(v)\n    \n    max_node = n\n    removed = set()\n    current = max_node\n    for _ in range(k):\n        if parent[current] != 0 and (parent[current] not in removed):\n            removed.add(parent[current])\n            current = parent[parent[current]]\n        else:\n            break\n    \n    result = []\n    visited_final = [False]*(n+1)\n    stack = [current]\n    visited_final[current] = True\n    while stack:\n        u = stack.pop()\n        result.append(u)\n        for v in children[u]:\n            if not visited_final[v]:\n                visited_final[v] = True\n                stack.append(v)\n    \n    result = sorted(result)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Tree Construction**: We first construct the tree using adjacency lists from the input edges.\n2. **BFS for Parent and Children**: Using BFS, we determine the parent and children of each node starting from the root (node 1).\n3. **Determine Removed Nodes**: Starting from the highest-numbered node, we move upwards to determine which nodes to remove to ensure the remaining nodes form a connected subtree.\n4. **Collect Remaining Nodes**: After determining the nodes to remove, we collect the remaining nodes in a connected subtree and print them in sorted order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the total fan count by keeping the highest possible districts while maintaining connectivity.",
