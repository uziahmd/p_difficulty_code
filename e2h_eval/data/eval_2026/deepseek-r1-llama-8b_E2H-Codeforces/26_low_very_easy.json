Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on the sides. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem states that Yuri has favorite numbers A, B, C, D where A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. We need to find the number of triangles with integer sides x, y, z such that:\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B\nB ≤ y ≤ C\nC ≤ z ≤ D\n\nAnd also, these sides must satisfy the triangle inequality for a non-degenerate triangle. That means, x + y > z, because in a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. Since z is the largest here, we just need to check if x + y > z.\n\nWait, but wait: in our case, since x ≤ y ≤ z, because x is up to B, y starts at B and goes up to C, and z starts at C up to D. So the order is x ≤ y ≤ z, right? Because x can be as big as B, y can be as small as B, so x can be equal to y, or y can be bigger. Similarly, y can be as big as C, and z starts at C. So yes, x ≤ y ≤ z.\n\nSo the triangle inequality requires x + y > z. Because the other inequalities (x + z > y and y + z > x) are automatically satisfied when z is the largest.\n\nSo our task is to count all triplets (x, y, z) where x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], z is in [C, D], and x ≤ y ≤ z, and x + y > z.\n\nBut wait, wait again. Wait, x can be up to B, and y can start at B, but also y could be larger than x. For example, if x is 2 and y is 3, then x ≤ y is true. But if x is 3 and y is 2, that would not fit because y must be ≥ B which is maybe 3, but in that case, x can't be larger than y. Hmm, no. Wait, the conditions are A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, and C ≤ z ≤ D. So x can be any value from A to B, y any from B to C, and z any from C to D. So x can be less than, equal, or even greater than y? Wait, no. Because x is up to B, and y starts at B, so x can be up to B, and y can be as low as B. So x can be equal to y or less than y. So for example, if x is 3 and y is 3, it's allowed. If x is 2 and y is 3, that's allowed. But if x is 4 and y is 3, that's not possible because x is at most B, and y is at least B. So x can't be larger than y. Because if B is, say, 5, and x is 5, y can be 5 or higher. So x will always be ≤ y.\n\nTherefore, in all valid triplets, x ≤ y ≤ z.\n\nSo the condition for a triangle is x + y > z.\n\nNow, the challenge is to efficiently compute how many triplets (x, y, z) satisfy the above conditions.\n\nConstraints are up to 5e5, so O(n^3) is impossible. We need an O(n^2) approach at worst, but probably better.\n\nLet me think about the approach.\n\nFirst, note that z can vary from C to D. For each possible z, we can calculate how many (x, y) pairs satisfy x + y > z, along with x in [A, B], y in [B, C], and x ≤ y.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to fix y and x, and find for each z in some range whether it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, since z is the largest, maybe we can precompute for each possible z the count of (x, y) pairs where x + y > z, x is in [A, B], y is in [max(B, x), C], and y >= B.\n\nWait, but perhaps the approach is to iterate over z, and for each z, compute the number of (x, y) pairs that satisfy x <= y, x <= B, y >= B, x + y > z, and y <= C, and x <= y <= C.\n\nHmm, that seems manageable.\n\nSo let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate z from C to D.\n   For each z, count the number of (x, y) pairs where:\n   - x is in [A, B]\n   - y is in [B, C",
