The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this Rock-Paper-Scissors problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that Nikephoros and Polycarpus played n rounds of rock-paper-scissors. Each round, they each choose a move according to their own sequences A and B, which they cycle through. The loser of each round gets a red spot. We need to calculate how many red spots each has after n rounds.\n\nHmm, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the input gives n, then two strings A and B. Each character in these strings represents their moves for each round, but they cycle through them. So for each round i (from 0 to n-1), Nikephoros uses A[i % m] and Polycarpus uses B[i % k], where m is the length of A and k is the length of B.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sequences are used cyclically starting from the first. So for the first round, it's A[0], then A[1], and so on until A[m-1], then back to A[0]. Similarly for B.\n\nSo for each round, we have to determine who wins and count the red spots accordingly.\n\nLet me think about how to model each round.\n\nFor each round i (starting from 0 to n-1):\n\n- Get a_i = A[i % len(A)]\n- Get b_i = B[i % len(B)]\n\nThen, determine who wins:\n\nIf a_i beats b_i, then the other player loses. So if a_i is 'R' and b_i is 'S', then R beats S, so Polycarpus loses (Nikephoros gains a point). Similarly, if a_i is 'S' and b_i is 'P', then Polycarpus loses again, and so on.\n\nWait, wait. Let's get the rules straight.\n\nThe rules are: Rock beats scissors, Scissors beat paper, Paper beats rock.\n\nSo for each pair of moves (a, b), we can determine who wins.\n\nLet's represent all possible outcomes:\n\nCase 1: a beats b → a wins, b loses.\nCase 2: b beats a → a loses, b wins.\nCase 3: It's a draw.\n\nSo for each a and b, check which case it is.\n\nNow, for each round, if a beats b, then the loser (b's player) gets a red spot. Because the winner is the one who makes the other person lose.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"the loser gets pinched.\" So if a beats b, then b is the loser (since a won), so Polycarpus (if he was using b) would get a red spot.\n\nSo for each round, the player with the losing move gets a red spot.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize two counters, say nike = 0 and poly = 0.\n\nFor each round from 0 to n-1:\n\n- get a_i = A[i % lenA]\n- get b_i = B[i % lenB]\n- determine if a_i beats b_i:\n   - if yes: Poly gets a point\n   - else if b_i beats a_i: Nike gets a point\n   - else: no points\n\nWait, no. Wait, if a_i beats b_i, then the loser is the one who played b_i. So in this case, since a_i is the winner, the loser is Polycarpus (he played b_i), so Poly gets a red spot.\n\nIf b_i beats a_i, then the loser is Nikephoros, so he gets a red spot.\n\nElse, it's a draw, so no one gets a red spot.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each i in 0..n-1:\n\na = A[i % m]\nb = B[i % k]\n\nif a == b: continue\n\nelse:\n\nif (a beats b): Poly += 1\n\nelse: Nike += 1\n\nSo now, the key is to determine, given a and b, whether a beats b or not.\n\nHow to implement that?\n\nWe can create a helper function or just use conditionals.\n\nLet's think: For a and b, what's the outcome.\n\nLet's write the conditions:\n\nif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') → a beats b\nelif (a == 'S' and b == 'P') → a beats b\nelif (a == 'P' and b == 'R') → a beats b\nelse: check if b beats a.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to represent the winning conditions.\n\nAnother approach: create a dictionary that for each a, what does it beat.\n\nLike:\n\nbeats = {\n    'R': 'S',\n    'S': 'P',\n    'P': 'R'\n}\n\nSo if a beats b, then b must be the value in beats[a], and a != b.\n\nSo, for example, if a is 'R', it beats 'S'.\n\nSo, for a and b:\n\nif a == b: no winner, no points.\n\nelse:\n\nif beats[a] == b: then a wins → Poly gets a point.\n\nelse: b wins → Nike gets a point.\n\nYes, that seems manageable.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nRead n, then A and B.\n\nCompute lenA = len(A), lenB = len(B).\n\nInitialize nike = 0, poly = 0.\n\nLoop for each i from 0 to n-1:\n\na = A[i % lenA]\n\nb = B[i % lenB]\n\nif a == b: continue\n\nelse:\n\nif beats[a] == b:\n\n   poly +=1\n\nelse:\n\n   nike +=1\n\nAfter processing all rounds, print nike and poly.\n\nThat should do it.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nWait, wait, in the problem statement, the input is written as ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR'], but perhaps it's a typo, maybe the second input is different.\n\nWait, looking at the note, in the sample, the game went like:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → P (Poly's move?) Wait, no, wait.\n\nWait, wait, the first line is n=7, then A is 'RPS', which is 3 characters, so the sequence for A is R, P, S, R, P, S, R, etc.\n\nB is 'RSPP', which is 4 characters: R, S, P, P.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nRound 0: i=0\n\nA[0] = R\n\nB[0] = R → draw.\n\nRound 1: i=1 → A[1%3=1] = P; B[1%4=1] = S.\n\nCheck if P beats S? No, because S is beaten by P only if P is the one? Wait, no.\n\nWait, wait, 'P' is paper, which is beaten by 'S'? Wait, no. Wait, the rules are:\n\nRock beats scissors.\n\nScissors beat paper.\n\nPaper beats rock.\n\nSo for a='P' and b='S': P is paper, which is beaten by scissors. So S beats P. So in this case, a is P, b is S. Since S beats P, the outcome is that b wins, so a's player (Nikephoros) loses. So Poly gains a point.\n\nWait, but in the sample explanation, the second round is P vs S, and the outcome is that the winner is S, which is Polycarpus's move. So Poly would have lost, meaning he gets a red spot. Wait, but according to the sample explanation, in the second round, it says \"Nikephoros loses\", which means Poly wins, so Poly gets a spot.\n\nWait, but in our code, when a is P and b is S:\n\na is P, which is beaten by S (because S beats P). So a does not beat b, so the else clause is triggered: b beats a. So Poly's move (b) is S, which beats a's P. So the loser is a's player (Nikephoros) → he gets a point.\n\nWait, but in the sample explanation, the second round is P (Nike) vs S (Poly). According to the rules, S beats P. So Poly's move wins, so Nike loses. So Poly gets a point.\n\nWait, in our code, when a is P and b is S:\n\nbeats[a] is 'R' (since P is beaten by R?), no. Wait, no, beats is defined as:\n\n'R' beats 'S'\n\n'S' beats 'P'\n\n'P' beats 'R'\n\nSo for a='P', beats[a] is 'R'. So if b is 'S', which is not equal to 'R', then a doesn't beat b. So we check if b beats a.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the logic.\n\nWait, perhaps the helper function should be:\n\nif a == b: draw.\n\nelse, check if a beats b: if yes, then a wins.\n\nElse, b wins.\n\nSo for a=P, b=S:\n\nDoes a beat b? a is P, beats is 'R', so no. So then, b (S) beats a (P) → yes. So in this case, b's player (Poly) wins, so a's player (Nike) loses, so Nike gets a point.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, the second round is P (Nike) vs S (Poly), which results in Poly losing, so he gets a point. Wait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the mapping wrong.\n\nWait, in the sample explanation, the second round is P (Nike) vs S (Poly). According to the rules, S beats P. So S is the winning move, so the winner is Poly. Thus, the loser is Nikephoros, so he gets a red spot.\n\nIn our code, for a=P, b=S:\n\na does not beat b (since P is beaten by S), so the code will proceed to see if b beats a. Which is true, since S beats P. So in this case, the else clause is triggered: Nike gets a point.\n\nWhich matches the sample: in that round, Nike gets a point.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the second round is P vs S, which results in Nike losing (so he gets a point).\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo the code correctly adds a point to Nike.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the output is 3 2, meaning that Poly has 2 points. How?\n\nWait, let's walk through the sample step by step.\n\nSample Input:\n\nn=7\n\nA: RPS → [R, P, S]\n\nB: RSPP → [R, S, P, P]\n\nSo for each of the 7 rounds:\n\ni=0: A[0] = R, B[0] = R → draw.\n\ni=1: A[1] = P, B[1] = S → P vs S. Does P beat S? No, because S beats P. So a does not beat b. So check if b beats a: yes, S beats P. So a's player (Nike) loses, so Nike gets a point.\n\ni=2: A[2] = S, B[2 mod 4] = 2 → S vs P. S beats P → a beats b. So Poly gets a point.\n\ni=3: A[3 mod 3] = A[0] = R; B[3 mod 4] = B[3] = P. R vs P: R is beaten by P. So a does not beat b. Check if b beats a: yes, P beats R. So a's player (Nike) loses, gets a point.\n\ni=4: A[4 mod 3] = A[1] = P; B[4 mod 4] = B[0] = R. P vs R: P beats R. So a beats b → Poly gets a point.\n\ni=5: A[5 mod 3] = A[2] = S; B[5 mod 4] = B[1] = S. Both S → draw.\n\ni=6: A[6 mod 3] = A[0] = R; B[6 mod 4] = B[2] = P. R vs P: R is beaten by P. So a does not beat b. B beats a → Nike loses, gets a point.\n\nSo total for Nike: 1 (i=1) + 1 (i=3) + 1 (i=6) = 3.\n\nTotal for Poly: 1 (i=2) + 1 (i=4) = 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output of 3 2.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B as strings.\n\nCompute lenA = len(A), lenB = len(B).\n\nCreate a dictionary beats where beats[a] is the move that a beats.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for each a, the move it beats is beats[a]. So beats['R'] = 'S', beats['S'] = 'P', beats['P'] = 'R'.\n\nSo:\n\nbeats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\nThen, for each round i from 0 to n-1:\n\nget a = A[i % lenA]\n\nget b = B[i % lenB]\n\nif a == b: continue\n\nelse:\n\nif beats[a] == b: Poly +=1\n\nelse: Nike +=1\n\nSo the code would look something like:\n\nn = int(input().strip())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nlenA = len(A)\n\nlenB = len(B)\n\nbeats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\nnike = 0\n\npoly = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    a = A[i % lenA]\n\n    b = B[i % lenB]\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        continue\n\n    if beats[a] == b:\n\n        poly +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        nike +=1\n\nprint(nike, poly)\n\nWait, but wait: in the sample, for i=4, A[1] is P, B[0] is R. So P beats R, so a beats b, so Poly gets a point.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTesting another example.\n\nAnother test case: let's say n=1, A='R', B='S'.\n\na='R' beats 'S' → Poly gets a point.\n\nOutput: 0 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A='S', B='R'.\n\na='S' beats 'R'? Wait, no. S beats P. R beats S. So a is S, b is R.\n\nbeats[a] is P. So a does not beat b. So check if b beats a: yes, R beats S. So a's player (Nike) loses, gets a point.\n\nSo output is 1 0.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- All draws: n=5, A and B same as each other. Then both have 0.\n\n- One player's sequence is much longer than the other. For example, m=1000, k=1, but n is 2e5.\n\nBut since the code loops n times, which is up to 2e5, it's manageable.\n\nTime constraints: n can be up to 2e5, which is acceptable for Python.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they have played a series of rounds of rock-paper-scissors. Each player follows a specific sequence of moves, and the loser of each round gets a red spot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game is played in `n` rounds where each player uses their respective sequences cyclically. The winner of each round is determined by the standard rules of rock-paper-scissors. The loser of each round gets a red spot.\n2. **Intuition**: For each round, we need to check the moves of both players. If one move beats the other according to the game rules, the loser gets a red spot. We use a dictionary to map each move to the move it beats.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Read the input values.\n   - Initialize counters for the red spots of both players.\n   - Loop through each round, determine the moves of both players using their sequences, and update the counters based on the game rules.\n4. **Complexity**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity, which is efficient given the constraints (up to 200,000 rounds).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input().strip())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nlenA = len(A)\nlenB = len(B)\n\nbeats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\nnike = 0\npoly = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a = A[i % lenA]\n    b = B[i % lenB]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    if beats[a] == b:\n        poly += 1\n    else:\n        nike += 1\n\nprint(nike, poly)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by the sequences `A` and `B` for the two players.\n- **Initialization**: We initialize counters `nike` and `poly` to keep track of the red spots for each player.\n- **Loop Through Rounds**: For each round, we determine the move of each player using their respective sequences. We use modulo operation to cycle through the sequences.\n- **Determine Winner**: Using a dictionary, we check if one move beats the other. If so, the corresponding player (the loser) gets a red spot.\n- **Output Result**: After processing all rounds, we print the count of red spots for both players.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the cyclic nature of the sequences and correctly applies the game rules to determine the winner of each round.",
