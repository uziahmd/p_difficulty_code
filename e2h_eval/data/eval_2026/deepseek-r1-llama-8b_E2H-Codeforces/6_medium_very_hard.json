Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Leha who wants to split his vacation into two parts using two vouchers. The goal is to find the minimal total cost of such two vouchers that don't overlap and their durations add up exactly to x.\n\nHmm, let's break down the problem.\n\nSo, each voucher has a start day li, end day ri, and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. We need to choose two different vouchers i and j such that:\n\n1. Their durations sum exactly to x.\n2. They don't intersect. That means either the end of one is before the start of the other, or vice versa.\n3. The total cost is as minimal as possible.\n\nIf no such pair exists, we output -1.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this efficiently because n can be up to 2e5, which is pretty big. So any O(n^2) approach is out of the question; that would be way too slow.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the solution.\n\nFor each voucher, maybe we can precompute what kind of vouchers would complement it. Like, for a voucher with duration d, the other should have duration x - d. So for each voucher, I can look for all vouchers with duration x-d that are non-overlapping.\n\nBut even that might not be efficient if done naively because for each voucher, you have to scan through a lot of others.\n\nWait, but the duration of each voucher is (ri - li + 1). So for each voucher, we can compute its required complementary duration, which is x minus its duration. Then, among all vouchers that have that complementary duration, we can find the one that doesn't overlap and has the minimal cost.\n\nBut how do we efficiently find the minimal cost voucher that doesn't overlap?\n\nHmm. Let's think about the non-overlapping condition. For a given voucher A, any voucher B that starts after A ends or ends before A starts would be acceptable.\n\nSo, for each voucher A, we can consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: B comes before A. So B's end is <= A's start.\n\nIn this case, B's end (rj) must be <= A's start (li). So for all vouchers B where rj <= li, and duration is x - dA, we can collect their costs and find the minimal one.\n\nCase 2: B comes after A. So A's end is <= B's start.\n\nSo A's end (ri) <= B's start (lj). For all such B, again with duration x - dA, collect the costs and find the minimal.\n\nWait, but for each A, how do we quickly find the B's that meet these conditions and have the required duration?\n\nThis seems tricky because for each A, we need to query the data structure for B's that have duration x - dA and satisfy either rj <= li or lj >= ri.\n\nHmm. Maybe we can pre-process the vouchers by their duration and sort them in a way that allows us to quickly query the minimal cost for certain ranges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can group all vouchers by their duration. So for each possible duration d, we have a list of vouchers with that duration. Then, for each voucher A of duration dA, we look into the group of vouchers with duration (x - dA) and find the ones that are either entirely before or entirely after A.\n\nBut even then, how to efficiently find the minimal cost for those groups?\n\nMaybe for each duration d, we can keep track of some information that allows us to quickly find the minimal cost for certain ranges.\n\nFor example, for the group of vouchers with duration x - dA, we can have two sorted lists:\n\n- One sorted by their end time (rj). So for a given A's start time li, we can find all B's in this group whose rj <= li. Among these, the one with minimal cost is the best for case 1.\n\n- Another sorted by their start time (lj). For a given A's end time ri, we can find all B's in this group whose lj >= ri. Among these, the one with minimal cost is the best for case 2.\n\nSo for each group d, we can pre-process the vouchers and create two structures:\n\n1. A sorted list of end times, along with the minimal cost up to that point.\n   Wait, maybe for each position in the sorted end times, we can store the minimal cost found so far. So when querying for rj <= li, we can binary search the end time and get the maximum index where end <= li, then get the minimal cost up to that index.\n\n2. Similarly, for the start times, we can sort them and for each position, have the minimal cost from that point onward. So when A's end is ri, we can find the first start >= ri, and then get the minimal cost from that index onwards.\n\nThis way, for each voucher A, we can quickly find the best possible B in O(log m) time, where m is the number of vouchers in the group x - dA.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers by their duration, grouping them into a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers.\n\n2. For each group (duration d), process the vouchers to prepare two structures:\n   a. End times sorted, and for each position, the minimal cost up to that point.\n   b. Start times sorted, and for each position, the minimal cost from that point onward.\n\n3. For each voucher A in the original list:\n   a. Compute the required duration for B: req_d = x - (ri - li + 1).\n   b. If req_d is negative, skip (since durations are positive).\n   c. Check if there exists a group for req_d.\n   d. If yes, proceed to find the minimal cost B in that group that is non-overlapping with A.\n      i. For case 1 (B ends before A starts): Find all B in group req_d with rj <= li. The minimal cost among them is a candidate.\n      ii. For case 2 (B starts after A ends): Find all B in group req_d with lj >= ri. The minimal cost among them is another candidate.\n   e. Take the minimal between these two candidates and add to A's cost. Keep track of the global minimum.\n\n4. After processing all vouchers, output the minimal total cost found, or -1 if none.\n\nNow, the challenge is implementing this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the data structures.\n\nFor each group d, we'll have two lists:\n\n- Sorted_end: a list of tuples (end_time, cost), sorted by end_time. Also, for each index, we need the minimal cost up to that index. So for each i, min_cost[i] is the minimal cost from 0 to i.\n\n- Sorted_start: a list of tuples (start_time, cost), sorted by start_time. For each index, we need the minimal cost from that index to the end.\n\nWait, but for the start list, when querying for lj >= ri, we need the minimal cost among those starting at or after ri. So for sorted start times, once we find the first start time >= ri, all elements from that index onwards qualify. So for each group, we can precompute a suffix_min array, where suffix_min[i] is the minimal cost from i to the end of the sorted start list.\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted end list, for each index, prefix_min[i] is the minimal cost from 0 to i.\n\nSo during preprocessing:\n\nFor each group d:\n\nSort the vouchers in the group by end_time for the sorted_end list.\n\nCompute prefix_min for sorted_end: prefix_min[0] = sorted_end[0].cost, prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_end[i].cost).\n\nSort the vouchers in the group by start_time for the sorted_start list.\n\nCompute suffix_min for sorted_start: suffix_min[-1] = sorted_start[-1].cost, and for i from len-2 downto 0: suffix_min[i] = min(sorted_start[i].cost, suffix_min[i+1]).\n\nWait, no. Because in the sorted_start list, the start times are increasing. So for a given ri, we can binary search to find the first start time >= ri. All elements from that index onwards are valid. Among these, we need the minimal cost. So the suffix_min array should give the minimal cost for each possible starting index.\n\nSo for each group d, the sorted_start list is sorted by start time, and for each index i, the suffix_min[i] is the minimal cost in the sublist from i to end.\n\nThus, during the processing for each voucher A:\n\nWe compute req_d = x - (ri - li + 1). If req_d is zero, it's invalid because we need two different vouchers. So we skip if req_d is zero or negative.\n\nThen, for group req_d, if it exists:\n\nCase 1: B ends before A starts. So B's end <= li.\n\nWe look into the sorted_end list of group req_d. We perform a binary search to find the largest end time <= li. If any such voucher exists, we take the minimal cost from the prefix_min up to that index.\n\nCase 2: B starts after A ends. So B's start >= ri.\n\nWe look into the sorted_start list of group req_d. We perform a binary search to find the first start time >= ri. If such a voucher exists, the minimal cost is suffix_min[index].\n\nSo for each A, we compute both cases, and then choose the minimal possible between the two, adding to A's cost.\n\nWait, but in each case, the minimal cost could be infinity (if no such B exists). So for each A, the minimal possible cost for that A is the sum of A's cost plus the minimal between the two cases.\n\nWe can then keep track of the overall minimal sum across all A.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read all vouchers.\n\n- Group them by duration.\n\n- For each group, precompute sorted_end with prefix_min, and sorted_start with suffix_min.\n\n- Iterate over each voucher A:\n\n   a. Compute dA = ri - li + 1.\n\n   b. req_d = x - dA.\n\n   c. If req_d < 0: continue.\n\n   d. If req_d is zero: continue (since we need two different vouchers).\n\n   e. If group req_d does not exist: continue.\n\n   f. Compute li and ri for A.\n\n   g. Case 1: find in group req_d's sorted_end list all B where rj <= li.\n\n      i. Use binary search to find the largest rj <= li.\n\n      ii. If found, the minimal cost is prefix_min of that index.\n\n   h. Case 2: find in group req_d's sorted_start list all B where lj >= ri.\n\n      i. Binary search to find the first lj >= ri.\n\n      ii. If found, the minimal cost is suffix_min of that index.\n\n   i. Now, for each case, if a B exists, get the cost. Take the minimal between the two, add to A's cost, and see if it's better than the current global minimum.\n\nOnce all A are processed, output the minimal cost or -1.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\n1. Vouchers that are completely overlapping or completely non-overlapping.\n\n2. When req_d is not present in the groups.\n\n3. When no B satisfies either case.\n\n4. When multiple B's satisfy, but the minimal cost is considered.\n\nAnother thing to note: the same voucher cannot be used twice. But since we're choosing two different vouchers, and the group for req_d will contain all vouchers, including A itself? Wait, no. Because each group is for a particular duration. So if A has duration d, and req_d is x - d, then A is not in the group req_d unless x is 2d, but in that case, we would have to avoid choosing A again.\n\nWait, but the group req_d is for vouchers with duration req_d. So if A has duration d, and req_d is x - d, then A is in group d, not in group req_d. So when considering B in group req_d, it's a different voucher.\n\nSo that's handled automatically.\n\nBut wait, suppose x is 2*d, and A is in group d. Then, group req_d is group d. So when processing A, we look for B in group d. But B can be any voucher in group d, except A, right? Because the problem requires i != j.\n\nAh, right. So in that case, when req_d is equal to d, we need to make sure that B is not the same as A.\n\nSo for each A, when processing case 1 and case 2 in group req_d, we need to exclude A itself if it's present.\n\nHmm, that complicates things. How can we handle that?\n\nBecause when req_d equals d, the group req_d is the same as the group d. So when looking for B, we have to ensure that B is not A.\n\nSo in that scenario, when group req_d is the same as group d, for each A, when looking for B in that group, we need to check whether any B exists except A.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, because for each group, we have all the vouchers with that duration. So when group req_d is same as group d, the sorted_end and sorted_start lists include A.\n\nSo when we perform the binary searches, we may end up selecting A as a candidate.\n\nWhich is incorrect because we can't choose the same voucher twice.\n\nSo how to handle that?\n\nHmm, perhaps when req_d == d (i.e., x is even and equal to 2d), we need to process the group as usual, but when looking for B, we should exclude the current voucher A.\n\nBut that's tricky because for each A, the group includes all vouchers of duration d, including A.\n\nSo during the case 1 and case 2 processing for A, when req_d is d, we need to make sure that B is not A.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative approach: when req_d == d, for each A, in the sorted_end and sorted_start lists, we can remove A from consideration.\n\nBut that would require, for each A, to process the group's lists without A, which is computationally expensive if done naively.\n\nWait, perhaps during the preprocessing phase, for each group, we can separate the vouchers into two parts: those that are A and those that are not. But that's not feasible because for each A, the group may have many vouchers, and we can't know in advance which A's to exclude.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to handle this case separately.\n\nWhen req_d == d, for each A, we can:\n\n- In case 1: find all B in group d with rj <= li, but B != A.\n\nSimilarly for case 2: B in group d with lj >= ri, but B != A.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nAn alternative idea: when req_d == d, we can, for the group, precompute the minimal cost excluding A.\n\nBut that's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, for each A, when req_d is d, we can process the group d's sorted_end and sorted_start lists, but when querying, we can check whether the voucher is A.\n\nWait, but that's not efficient because for each query, we'd have to scan through all the possible B's, which would be O(m) per query.\n\nWhich is not acceptable for large n.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can find a way to mark A as a special case in the group.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the preprocessing phase, for each group, we can precompute two structures: one that includes all vouchers, and another that excludes A. But that's also not feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps during the processing of each A, when req_d == d, for the group d, we can:\n\n- For case 1: find the minimal cost B in group d with rj <= li, and B is not A.\n\nSimilarly for case 2.\n\nSo, during the binary search, when we find B's that meet the time condition, we need to check if B is A.\n\nBut how to do that quickly.\n\nWait, because when req_d == d, group d is the same as group req_d. So for the sorted_end list, all B's that have rj <= li are candidates, but we need to exclude A if it's in this subset.\n\nBut checking whether A is in this subset is O(1) if we have a way to identify A in the group.\n\nWait, but how? Each voucher has a unique index in the input.\n\nWait, perhaps we can assign an index to each voucher, and for each group, we can have a list of vouchers along with their indices.\n\nSo during preprocessing:\n\nEach group is a list of tuples: (li, ri, cost, index).\n\nThen, when req_d == d, for each A, when looking for B in group d, we can, after finding the possible B's via binary search, check if their index is not equal to A's index.\n\nBut that adds an O(1) check per B in the found range.\n\nBut in the worst case, for each A, the range could be large, leading to O(m) time, which is not feasible.\n\nHmm, this seems like a problem.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps when req_d == d, the minimal cost when B is allowed to be A is considered, but then we have to subtract that possibility and find the next minimal.\n\nBut that could complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal cost when req_d == d is already considered in the initial approach, but in that case, when the minimal cost is from A itself, we have to skip it and find the next minimal.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's acceptable to process the initial approach and then, after finding the minimal possible sum, check whether the minimal B is A. If it is, then we have to look for the next minimal.\n\nBut that adds complexity.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to, for each A, when req_d == d, perform the binary searches as before, but when a B is found that meets the time condition, check if it's A. If it is, skip it and find the next possible.\n\nBut this could be time-consuming if A is in the list and the list is long.\n\nWait, but for each A, the binary search for case 1 and case 2 would only consider B's that meet the time constraints. So in case 1, the B's have rj <= li. So if A is in that list, then A's rj is <= li, which implies that A's end is <= A's start, which is impossible. So A can't be in that list.\n\nWait, that's a key point.\n\nBecause A's rj is ri, which is >= li. So for case 1, B's rj must be <= li. Since A's rj is ri, which is >= li (because li is the start of A). So A's rj is >= li, so A's rj cannot be <= li. Thus, A cannot be in the case 1 list for group d when req_d is d.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2, B's lj must be >= ri. A's lj is li, which is <= ri. So A's lj is <= ri, thus A's lj cannot be >= ri. So A is not in the case 2 list for group d.\n\nTherefore, when req_d == d, A cannot be in the B's for either case 1 or case 2. So in this scenario, the initial approach correctly ignores A, and the minimal cost found is for B != A.\n\nSo, no need to worry about that case.\n\nThat's a relief.\n\nSo, the initial approach is safe and doesn't require any modifications for the case when req_d == d.\n\nSo, moving forward.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement the preprocessing.\n\nI'll outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read n and x.\n\nThen, read n lines, each with li, ri, costi.\n\nStore each as a Voucher object or a tuple, including li, ri, cost, and index.\n\nGroup them by duration: create a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers (li, ri, cost, index).\n\nFor each group in the dictionary:\n\nSort the vouchers by end time (ri) to create the sorted_end list.\n\nCompute the prefix_min array for sorted_end.\n\nSort the vouchers by start time (li) to create the sorted_start list.\n\nCompute the suffix_min array for sorted_start.\n\nOnce all groups are processed, for each voucher A in the original list:\n\nCompute dA = ri - li + 1.\n\nreq_d = x - dA.\n\nIf req_d < 0: skip.\n\nIf req_d == 0: skip (since we need two vouchers, but their durations would sum to zero, which is impossible).\n\nCheck if req_d is in the groups.\n\nIf not, skip.\n\nElse, get the group.\n\nNow, process case 1: B ends before A starts.\n\nWe need B's rj <= li.\n\nIn the group's sorted_end list, find the largest rj <= li.\n\nIf any, get the minimal cost up to that index.\n\nCase 2: B starts after A ends.\n\nWe need B's lj >= ri.\n\nIn the group's sorted_start list, find the first lj >= ri.\n\nIf any, get the minimal cost from that index onwards.\n\nFor each case, if a valid B exists, compute the sum of A's cost and B's cost.\n\nKeep track of the minimal sum across all such possibilities.\n\nFinally, output the minimal sum, or -1.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement the binary search.\n\nIn Python, the bisect module can help.\n\nFor case 1:\n\nsorted_end is a list of tuples (ri, cost, index), sorted by ri.\n\nWe need to find the largest ri <= li.\n\nWe can extract the ri's into a separate list for binary search.\n\nOr, since the list is sorted, we can use bisect_right.\n\nFor example:\n\nFor each B in sorted_end, the ri is B[0].\n\nWe can create a list of ri's: [b[0] for b in sorted_end].\n\nUsing bisect.bisect_right(ri_list, li) - 1.\n\nIf the index is >=0, then the minimal cost is prefix_min[index].\n\nSimilarly for case 2:\n\nsorted_start is a list of tuples (li, cost, index), sorted by li.\n\nWe need to find the first li >= ri.\n\nCreate a list of li's: [b[0] for b in sorted_start].\n\nUsing bisect_left.\n\nIf the index is < len(sorted_start), then the minimal cost is suffix_min[index].\n\nWait, but the suffix_min is computed for the sorted_start list, which is sorted in increasing order of li.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, let's outline the code.\n\nImplementing in Python:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nvouchers = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    l, r, c = map(int, input().split())\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, c, i) )\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ngroups = defaultdict(list)\nfor v in vouchers:\n    d = v[1] -

So if a group has no vouchers, then the preprocessed groups will have empty lists. But since in the code, when req_d is in the groups, it must have at least one voucher, because the group was built from the original vouchers.\n\nWait, no. Because groups are built as defaultdict(list), so if a group has no vouchers, it's not added to the preprocessed_groups.\n\nWait, no. Because for each d in groups.keys(), which are the durations present in the vouchers, so the group is processed.\n\nSo, when req_d is in the groups, the group must have at least one voucher.\n\nWait, no. Because groups is a defaultdict, but when we iterate through groups, which is for d in groups, which are the keys with non-zero counts.\n\nSo, for each group in groups, it has at least one voucher.\n\nThus, in the code, when req_d is in preprocessed_groups, the group_info exists.\n\nSo the code should be fine.\n\nTesting the example:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\nVouchers:\n\n1 3 4 --> duration 3\n\n1 2 5 --> duration 2\n\n5 6 1 --> duration 2\n\n1 2 4 --> duration 2\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sample input seems to have four vouchers. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Oh, sorry, perhaps the input is a string representation, but probably, the actual input is n=4 and x=5, followed by 4 lines of vouchers.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the first line is n and x, then n lines of vouchers.\n\nSo the sample input is:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4\n\n1 2 5\n\n5 6 1\n\n1 2 4\n\nWait, no, perhaps the sample input is given as:\n\nAfter the first line '4 5', then 4 lines:\n\nLine 1: 1 3 4 --> li=1, ri=3, cost=4 → duration 3.\n\nLine 2: 1 2 5 → duration 2.\n\nLine 3: 5 6 1 → duration 2.\n\nLine 4: 1 2 4 → duration 2.\n\nWait, no, that can't be, because the third voucher is 5-6, which is 2 days.\n\nWait, the sample explanation says that the first and third vouchers are chosen. Let's see:\n\nFirst voucher: 1-3, duration 3.\n\nThird voucher: 5-6, duration 2. Sum is 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in the code, for each A, when it's the first voucher, dA=3, req_d=2.\n\nLooking into group 2.\n\nIn group 2, the vouchers are the second, third, and fourth.\n\nWait, no, the third voucher is 5-6, duration 2.\n\nThe fourth voucher is 1-2, duration 2.\n\nSo group 2 has three vouchers:\n\nvoucher 2: 1-2, cost 5, index 1.\n\nvoucher 3:5-6, cost 1, index 2.\n\nvoucher4:1-2, cost4, index3.\n\nProcessing voucher 1 (index0):\n\na_l =1, a_r=3, a_cost=4.\n\ndA=3, req_d=5-3=2.\n\ngroup 2 exists.\n\ncase1: B ends before a_l=1.\n\nSo rj <=1.\n\nLooking into group 2's sorted_end.\n\nThe vouchers in group 2 are:\n\nvoucher2: r=2.\n\nvoucher3: r=6.\n\nvoucher4: r=2.\n\nSo sorted_end is [(1-2, cost5, index1), (1-2, cost4, index3), (5-6, cost1, index2)].\n\nWait, no. Wait, group2 is [voucher2, voucher3, voucher4].\n\nWhen sorted by rj: voucher2's rj is 2, voucher4's rj is 2, voucher3's rj is6.\n\nSo sorted_end is [voucher2, voucher4, voucher3], ordered by rj.\n\nSo their rj's are 2,2,6.\n\nprefix_min is [5,4,1].\n\nWait, no. Let me re-calculate:\n\nvoucher2 has cost5, voucher4 has cost4, voucher3 has cost1.\n\nSo sorted_end is sorted by rj: voucher2 (r=2), voucher4 (r=2), voucher3 (r=6).\n\nSo their order is:\n\nvoucher2 (r=2, cost5), voucher4(r=2, cost4), voucher3(r=6, cost1).\n\nSo prefix_min is:\n\n5, min(5,4)=4, min(4,1)=1.\n\nSo for case1, a_l is 1.\n\nWe find B's rj <=1.\n\nLooking into the sorted_end_ri list: [2, 2,6].\n\nWe do bisect_right on 1. It returns 0. So idx=0-1=-1. So no B in case1.\n\nSo case1 gives nothing.\n\nCase2: B starts after a_r=3.\n\nLooking into group2's sorted_start, which is sorted by lj.\n\nThe vouchers are:\n\nvoucher2: l=1.\n\nvoucher4: l=1.\n\nvoucher3: l=5.\n\nSo sorted_start is [voucher2, voucher4, voucher3], ordered by lj=1,1,5.\n\nsuffix_min is computed as follows:\n\nvoucher2's cost5, voucher4's cost4, voucher3's cost1.\n\nSuffix_min for index 0: min(5,4,1) =1.\n\nindex1: min(4,1)=1.\n\nindex2:1.\n\nSo when a_r is 3, we find the first lj >=3.\n\nbisect_left on [1,1,5], target 3.\n\nThe list is [1,1,5]. Looking for 3.\n\nbisect_left finds the insertion point at 2 (since 5 is the first element >=3).\n\nSo idx=2.\n\nsuffix_min[2] is 1.\n\nSo case2 gives 1.\n\nTotal cost is 4+1=5.\n\nWhich is the minimal.\n\nSo the code should capture this.\n\nAnother test case: when the group is not present.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3 2\n\nEach voucher has duration 3.\n\nSo for each voucher, the duration is 3. So x=2.\n\nWait, no, the sample input in the problem statement is:\n\nIt's unclear, but the sample says that in the second sample, the output is -1.\n\nWait, the problem statement says:\n\nSecond sample:\n\nn=4, x=5.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nAnother test case where x=5 and the output is 5 and -1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's see.\n\nWait, the problem's sample input is:\n\nSample Input:\n\n4 5\n\n...\n\nWait, perhaps the code needs to handle cases where the sum is x.\n\nBut regardless, the code seems to handle it.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The code reads from stdin, but in the problem statement, the code is supposed to read from stdin.\n\nWait, the input is given as a string in the problem, but in the code, perhaps the input is read from stdin.\n\nWait, the code needs to read from standard input.\n\nWait, the code is to read from stdin, and output the result.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input is given as ['4 5...', but perhaps that's a formatting error. Wait, perhaps the code expects the input to be read from stdin.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is provided as a string, but the problem statement says to read from stdin.\n\nSo in the code, I'll need to read from stdin.\n\nSo the code should read the input as n and x, followed by n lines.\n\nSo, in the code, perhaps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n lines, but perhaps the code needs to read from stdin.\n\nWait, the code should read from stdin, compute the result.\n\nSo, the code is to read from stdin, compute, etc.\n\nSo, the plan is to write a Python script that reads from stdin, computes, and outputs the answer.\n\nBut how to read the input? Because the problem statement gives an example with input.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe input is a competitive programming problem.\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nFirst line: n and x.\n\nThen n lines, each with three integers: li, ri, costi.\n\nSo, the code should read n and x, then read n lines, each line being a voucher.\n\nSo, in Python, perhaps the code can read via input(), but for larger inputs, it's better to read via sys.stdin.\n\nBut for this problem, n is up to 2e5, so reading via sys.stdin is better.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\nvouchers = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    l, r, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, c, _) )\n\nThen, group them.\n\nAnd proceed as before.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that when a group is empty, but that's handled earlier.\n\nAlso, when x is less than the minimal possible sum of two durations.\n\nBut that's handled as req_d would be negative.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the code on the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 → duration 3\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2\n\nSo, the code should find that the minimal sum is 5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3 2\n\nEach voucher has duration 3.\n\nSo, for each voucher, dA=3, req_d=2-3= -1.\n\nSo, no voucher can be selected.\n\nThus, output is -1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nAnother test case: when x is 4.\n\nSuppose we have two vouchers:\n\nvoucher1: duration 2, cost 10.\n\nvoucher2: duration 2, cost 20.\n\nThey are non-overlapping.\n\nSum is 4.\n\nSo, minimal cost is 30.\n\nBut if they are overlapping, then the code will not find them in case 1 or 2.\n\nThus, code should output 30.\n\nAnother test case: when the minimal sum is achieved by taking two vouchers from the same group, but not overlapping.\n\nThus, the code should handle it.\n\nPotential performance issues:\n\nTime constraints.\n\nn is up to 2e5.\n\nFor each voucher, for each group, two binary searches are done, each O(log m), where m is up to 2e5.\n\nThus, total time is O(n log m), which should be acceptable.\n\nSpace-wise, storing the groups is O(n).\n\nThus, the code should pass within the time limits.\n\nSo, the final code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers whose combined duration equals exactly `x` days and whose total cost is minimized. The approach involves preprocessing the vouchers to efficiently find the optimal pairs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each voucher has a start day, end day, and cost. We need to find two vouchers such that their durations sum to `x` and they do not overlap. The goal is to minimize the total cost of these two vouchers.\n\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration. For each group, we preprocess the vouchers to quickly find the minimal cost for non-overlapping pairs.\n\n3. **Preprocessing**:\n   - For each duration group, sort vouchers by their end day and compute a prefix minimum cost array.\n   - Sort the same group by their start day and compute a suffix minimum cost array.\n\n4. **Finding Optimal Pairs**:\n   - For each voucher, determine the required complementary duration.\n   - Use binary search on preprocessed arrays to find the minimal cost non-overlapping voucher in the complementary group.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    vouchers = []\n    for idx in range(n):\n        l, r, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        vouchers.append((l, r, c, idx))\n    \n    from collections import defaultdict\n    groups = defaultdict(list)\n    for v in vouchers:\n        d = v[1] - v[0] + 1\n        groups[d].append(v)\n    \n    preprocessed_groups = {}\n    for d in groups:\n        sorted_end = sorted(groups[d], key=lambda x: x[1])\n        ri_list = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n        prefix_min = []\n        current_min = float('inf')\n        for v in sorted_end:\n            current_min = min(current_min, v[2])\n            prefix_min.append(current_min)\n        \n        sorted_start = sorted(groups[d], key=lambda x: x[0])\n        li_list = [v[0] for v in sorted_start]\n        suffix_min = []\n        if len(sorted_start) > 0:\n            suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_start)\n            suffix_min[-1] = sorted_start[-1][2]\n            for i in range(len(sorted_start)-2, -1, -1):\n                suffix_min[i] = min(sorted_start[i][2], suffix_min[i+1])\n        preprocessed_groups[d] = {\n            'sorted_end': (ri_list, prefix_min),\n            'sorted_start': (li_list, suffix_min)\n        }\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    for a in vouchers:\n        a_l, a_r, a_cost, a_idx = a\n        dA = a_r - a_l + 1\n        req_d = x - dA\n        if req_d < 0 or req_d == 0:\n            continue\n        if req_d not in preprocessed_groups:\n            continue\n        \n        group_info = preprocessed_groups[req_d]\n        sorted_end_ri, sorted_end_cm = group_info['sorted_end']\n        sorted_start_li, sorted_start_sm = group_info['sorted_start']\n        \n        # Case 1: B ends before A starts (rj <= a_l)\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_end_ri, a_l) - 1\n        if idx >= 0:\n            min_cost_case1 = sorted_end_cm[idx]\n            total = a_cost + min_cost_case1\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n        \n        # Case 2: B starts after A ends (lj >= a_r)\n        idx = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_start_li, a_r)\n        if idx < len(sorted_start_li):\n            min_cost_case2 = sorted_start_sm[idx]\n            total = a_cost + min_cost_case2\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers.\n- **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration to facilitate efficient lookups.\n- **Preprocessing**: Each group is preprocessed to allow quick binary search operations for finding non-overlapping vouchers with minimal cost.\n- **Finding Optimal Pairs**: For each voucher, the algorithm checks both possible cases (one before and one after) using binary search on the preprocessed arrays to find the minimal cost pair that meets the criteria.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles all edge cases, providing the correct minimal cost or indicating if no valid pairs exist.",
