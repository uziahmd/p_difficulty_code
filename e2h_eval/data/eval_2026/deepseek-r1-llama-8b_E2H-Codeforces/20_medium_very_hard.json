For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of ways to choose integers c_s for all binary strings s of lengths 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. The answer needs to be modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm, let's break down what a beautiful multiset is. A multiset is beautiful if for every string s (from length 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix doesn't exceed c_s. And we need to choose the c_s's such that when you build the largest possible beautiful multiset, its size is exactly f.\n\nWait, no— wait. The problem says that for each s, the count of s's prefixes in the multiset must not exceed c_s. So the beautiful multiset is constructed by selecting certain strings of length up to n, and for each string in the multiset, all of its prefixes must satisfy their respective c_s constraints.\n\nWait, no. Wait, more precisely: For every string s (of any length from 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must be <= c_s. So for example, for s being \"0\", how many strings in the multiset have \"0\" as a prefix. That would include all strings that start with \"0\", like \"00\", \"01\", \"000\", etc., but in our case, since the multiset consists of strings of exactly length n, perhaps? Or no, wait— wait, the problem says the multiset is of binary strings of length exactly n. Oh wait, no: The problem statement says \"binary strings of length from 1 to n\". So the multiset can contain any binary string with length between 1 and n.\n\nWait, but the note in the problem says that the example has a multiset {11, 01, 00, 01}, which includes strings of lengths 2 and 1 (like '01' is length 2, but '0' is not present). Wait, no, looking back: The example says it's a multiset of strings of length exactly n=2. Because the example says, for s being \"0\", which is length 1, and counts how many in the multiset have \"0\" as a prefix. So the multiset can include strings of any length up to n.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-read the problem statement:\n\n\"A multiset of binary strings of length exactly n is considered beautiful...\" No, wait, the problem says:\n\n\"For example, let n = 2, ... The multiset is of length exactly n=2.\"\n\nAh, okay, so the beautiful multiset is a multiset where all strings are of length exactly n. But the condition is that for every binary string s of length 1 to n, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is <= c_s.\n\nSo for example, for s=\"0\" (length 1), the count is the number of strings in the multiset that start with \"0\"— which could be of any length up to n. Because for each s, regardless of its length, you check all longer strings that have s as a prefix.\n\nWait, that's a bit tricky. So for s of length m (where 1<=m<=n), any string in the multiset that starts with s will contribute to c_s.\n\nBut wait, the multiset is built by selecting some strings of exactly n bits. So for each s, the count is the number of selected strings that have s as a prefix. So for example, for s being \"0\", any string in the multiset that starts with \"0\" (like \"00\", \"01\", \"000\" if n was 3, etc.) will count towards c_0.\n\nBut since the strings are of length exactly n, any string in the multiset that starts with s must be longer than s. So for s of length m, the count is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix and are of length exactly n.\n\nSo the condition is that for each s (any prefix of any string in the multiset), the count of such strings is <= c_s.\n\nOur task is to choose the c_s's for all possible s (strings of lengths 1..n) such that the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nSo, first, the problem is to find all possible assignments of c_s's such that the maximum possible beautiful multiset has size exactly f.\n\nI think the approach is to model this as a combinatorial problem where each c_s determines a constraint on the selection of strings in the multiset.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem.\n\nEach string t in the multiset contributes to the counts of all its prefixes s. For example, if t is \"010\", then it contributes +1 to c_0, c_01, and c_010.\n\nSo the constraints are: for each s, the total number of t's in the multiset that have s as a prefix must be <= c_s.\n\nWe want the largest possible multiset under these constraints. Then, among all possible c_s assignments, count those where the maximum size is exactly f.\n\nWait, but the c_s's are variables we choose. So for each possible assignment of c_s's, the maximum size is determined, and we need to count the number of c assignments where this maximum is f.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to two steps:\n\n1. For a given assignment of c_s's, compute the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset.\n\n2. Count the number of c assignments where this maximum is equal to f.\n\nBut directly computing this seems difficult because n is up to 15, which suggests that the number of possible s's is manageable, but the c_s's can be up to 2e5.\n\nWait, but n is up to 15, so the number of possible s's is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^15 = 2^16 - 2 = 65534. So each s can be represented as an integer or a bitmask.\n\nSo, for each s, c_s can be up to k, which is 2e5, but for the problem, the c_s's must be chosen such that the sum over all s of the minimum(c_s, ...) equals f, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem using inclusion-exclusion or some form of dynamic programming.\n\nAnother angle: The maximum size of the beautiful multiset is determined by the minimal c_s's across all possible s's.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum size is the sum for each s of the minimum between c_s and the number of strings of length n that have s as a prefix.\n\nBecause for each s, the maximum number of times s can appear as a prefix in the multiset is min(c_s, the number of such strings).\n\nWait, no. Because for a given s, the number of strings of length n that have s as a prefix is exactly 2^{n - len(s)}. For example, s is of length m; the next n-m bits can be anything.\n\nSo for each s, the maximum possible contribution to the multiset is min(c_s, 2^{n - m} ), where m is the length of s.\n\nTherefore, the maximum size F is the sum over all s of min(c_s, 2^{n - |s|} }.\n\nWait, but this isn't quite right because for longer s's, their contributions are subsets of shorter ones. For example, s=\"00\" is a prefix of \"000\", so the count for s=\"0\" includes all the strings that have \"00\" as a prefix.\n\nWait, no. Each string in the multiset is of length n. For a given s, the count is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. So s can be of any length up to n.\n\nSo for each s, the count is the number of t in the multiset where s is a prefix of t.\n\nBut t is of length n. So s must be a prefix of t, meaning that s is a substring of t of length |s|. So for s of length m, the number of t's in the multiset that have s as a prefix is equal to the number of t's that start with s.\n\nThe number of possible t's that start with s is 2^{n - m}.\n\nSo for each s of length m, the maximum possible count is min(c_s, 2^{n - m}).\n\nSo the total maximum size F is the sum of min(c_s, 2^{n - m}) for all s.\n\nBut wait, because for s1 a prefix of s2, the count for s1 includes the count for s2. So the sum may not just be additive.\n\nNo, wait, no. Because for each string t in the multiset, it contributes to all s's that are prefixes of t. So the counts for the various s's are not independent.\n\nHmm, this complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the problem differently.\n\nSuppose that for each s, we have a variable a_s which is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. Then, a_s <= c_s for all s.\n\nMoreover, for any s', if s is a prefix of s', then a_s' <= a_s.\n\nWait, no. Because a_s is the count of t's that have s as a prefix. If s is a prefix of s', then any t that has s' as a prefix also has s as a prefix. So a_s >= a_{s'}.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, a_s is the number of t's that have s as a prefix. If s is a prefix of s', then s' is a longer string. So any t that has s' as a prefix will automatically have s as a prefix. So a_s >= a_{s'}, because a_{s'} is the count of t's that have s' as a prefix (which is a subset of those that have s as a prefix).\n\nWait, no. Let me think: a_s is the count of t's that have s as a prefix. a_{s'} is the count of t's that have s' as a prefix. Since s is a prefix of s', any t that has s' as a prefix must have s as a prefix. So a_s' is a subset of a_s. Therefore, a_s >= a_s'.\n\nWait, no: a_s is the count for s, a_s' is the count for s'. So if s is a prefix of s', then s' is longer. So the set of t's that have s' as a prefix is a subset of those that have s as a prefix. Therefore, a_s' <= a_s.\n\nWait, yes. So for any s, a_s is the sum of a_{s'} for all s' that are proper prefixes of s.\n\nWait, no. Because a_s is the count of t's that have s as a prefix. Any t that has s' as a prefix (where s' is a proper prefix of s) will also have s as a prefix. So a_s is the sum of a_{s'} for all s' that are proper prefixes of s plus the count of t's that have exactly s as a prefix and no longer prefixes.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the a_s variables as a tree, where each node is a string s, and its children are the superstrings of s (i.e., the strings that have s as a prefix). Then, a_s is the sum of a_{s'} for all s' that are immediate children of s in this tree, plus the count of strings in the multiset that exactly match s.\n\nHmm, maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternative approach: Each string t in the multiset contributes 1 to a_s for each s that is a prefix of t. So for t of length n, the set of s's that are prefixes of t is exactly all s's that are prefixes of t. For each s in this set, a_s increases by 1.\n\nSo, the a_s variables are related in a hierarchical way. For example, if s is a prefix of s', then a_s >= a_s'.\n\nBut perhaps the key insight is that the a_s's form a downward-closed set. Because if s is a prefix of s', then a_s' cannot be larger than a_s.\n\nWait, no. Because a_s' is the count of t's that have s' as a prefix. These t's are a subset of those that have s as a prefix. So a_s' is <= a_s.\n\nTherefore, for all s, a_s' <= a_s whenever s' is a proper prefix of s.\n\nThis is important because it implies that the a_s's form a chain: a_0 (the empty string) is the root, and for each s, a_s <= a_{s'}, where s' is a longer string that is a prefix of s.\n\nWait, no. The empty string is not part of the problem, since s's are of lengths from 1 to n.\n\nWait, for the empty string, perhaps it's not considered, but for the other s's, the a_s's are constrained by the hierarchy.\n\nSo, the maximum possible a_s is min(c_s, 2^{n - |s|} }, but subject to a_s >= a_{s'}, for any s' that is a proper prefix of s.\n\nWait, but this is not necessarily the case. Because a_s can be as high as min(c_s, 2^{n - |s|}), but for s' that is a prefix of s, a_{s'} can be at most a_s.\n\nSo, the problem of finding the maximum F is equivalent to choosing a_s's such that:\n\nFor each s:\n\na_s <= c_s\n\na_s >= a_{s'}, for all s' that are proper prefixes of s.\n\nAnd F = sum_{s} a_s.\n\nWe need to maximize F.\n\nBut this seems like a challenging combinatorial optimization problem.\n\nBut in our problem, the c_s's are variables that we can choose, and the F is the sum of a_s's for all s, given the constraints.\n\nWait, but the problem is to count the number of c_s assignments such that the maximum possible F is exactly f.\n\nSo, for each possible assignment of c_s's, the maximum F is computed as the sum of a_s's, where a_s is the minimum of c_s and 2^{n - |s|}, and a_s must be >= a_{s'}, for all s' that are proper prefixes of s.\n\nWait, but perhaps the maximum F is the sum of min(c_s, 2^{n - |s|} ) for all s, but adjusted for the constraints that a_s >= a_{s'}.\n\nHmm, maybe not. Because for example, suppose s' is a prefix of s, then a_s' can be as large as min(c_{s'}, 2^{n - |s'|} ), but a_s has to be >= a_s'. So the maximum a_s is the minimum of c_s and 2^{n - |s|}, but also a_s must be >= the a_s' of all its proper prefixes.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal a_s is the minimum of c_s and 2^{n - |s|}, but also a_s must be >= the a_s' of all its proper prefixes.\n\nWait, but how does this affect the maximum F?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum F is the sum of min(c_s, 2^{n - |s|} ), but ensuring that for each s, a_s >= a_{s'}, i.e., that the a_s's form a non-decreasing sequence along the prefix tree.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum F is the sum of min(c_s, 2^{n - |s|} ), without considering the a_s' constraints, because the a_s's can be arranged in a way that satisfies the hierarchy.\n\nWait, maybe that's the case. Because for any s, the a_s can be set as the minimum of c_s and 2^{n - |s|}, and since s's longer prefixes have lower a_s's, this might be possible.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose n=2.\n\ns can be \"0\", \"1\", \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\".\n\nFor each s, 2^{n - |s|} is:\n\ns length 1: 2^(2-1) = 2.\n\ns length 2: 2^(2-2)=1.\n\nSo for each s, the maximum possible a_s is min(c_s, 2 for length 1, 1 for length 2).\n\nNow, for the hierarchy:\n\nFor example, \"0\" is a prefix of \"00\" and \"01\".\n\nSo a_0 can be up to 2, a_00 is up to 1, a_01 is up to 1.\n\nBut a_0 must be >= a_00 and a_01.\n\nSimilarly, a_0 is a prefix of \"1\", so a_0 >= a_1.\n\nSo, if c_0 is 3, c_00 is 1, c_01 is 2, c_1 is 1, c_10 is 2, c_11 is 3.\n\nThen, the a_0 is min(3, 2) = 2.\n\na_00 is min(1,1) =1.\n\na_01 is min(2,1)=1.\n\na_1 is min(1,2)=1.\n\na_10 is min(2,1)=1.\n\na_11 is min(3,1)=1.\n\nNow, the sum is 2+1+1+1+1+1 =7.\n\nBut wait, the constraints are a_0 >= a_00, a_0 >= a_01, a_0 >= a_1, etc.\n\nIn this case, a_0=2, which is >= all the others.\n\nSo it's valid.\n\nBut what if c_0 is 1, c_00 is 2.\n\nWait, no, because 2^{n - |s|} for s=0 is 2, so a_0 can be at most 2. So if c_0 is 1, then a_0 is 1.\n\nThen, a_00 can be min(c_00, 1). Suppose c_00 is 3, so a_00 is 1.\n\nSimilarly, a_01 can be min(c_01, 1). Suppose c_01 is 4, a_01 is 1.\n\na_1 is min(c_1, 2). Suppose c_1 is 5, a_1 is 2.\n\nWait, but a_0 is 1, which is less than a_1=2. But a_0 must be >= a_1.\n\nSo this would be invalid. So the a_1 cannot be higher than a_0.\n\nSo in this case, the a_1 can't be more than a_0. So when c_1 allows a higher a_1 than a_0, it's constrained by a_0.\n\nThus, the maximum a_0 is min(c_0, 2), but a_1 can't exceed a_0. So a_1 can be at most min(c_1, a_0).\n\nSo in this case, the a_1 is min(c_1, a_0).\n\nWhich would mean that the sum depends on the hierarchy.\n\nSo, the initial idea that F is the sum of min(c_s, 2^{n - |s|}) is incorrect because the hierarchy of the a_s's imposes additional constraints.\n\nThus, the maximum F is not simply the sum of min(c_s, 2^{n - |s|}), but also requires that for each s, a_s >= a_{s'}, for all s' that are proper prefixes of s.\n\nThis makes the problem more complex.\n\nSo, how do we model this? Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: We can model the problem as a tree where each node represents a string s, and its children are the strings that have s as a prefix. The root is the empty string, but since our s's start from length 1, perhaps the root is not considered.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the entire trie of all possible binary strings, but since the strings are of length up to n, the depth of the trie is n.\n\nEach node s has a value a_s, which is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix.\n\nThe constraints are:\n\n- a_s <= c_s for all s.\n\n- a_s >= a_t for all t that are proper prefixes of s.\n\nWe want to maximize the sum of all a_s.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with a DP approach, where we process the strings in order of increasing length, ensuring that the a_s's satisfy the hierarchy.\n\nBut the issue is that for each s, a_s is constrained by the a_t's of its prefixes.\n\nSo perhaps the DP state can track the current a_s's, but that's impractical due to the large possible values.\n\nAnother approach is to realize that for a given s, the maximum a_s is min(c_s, 2^{n - |s|} ), but it's also bounded by the a_t's of its prefixes.\n\nWait, but for s, all of its proper prefixes t must have a_t <= a_s.\n\nSo, for the maximum sum F, each a_s is as large as possible, but not exceeding c_s and not smaller than any a_t where t is a proper prefix of s.\n\nSo, the a_s's form a non-decreasing path along the trie.\n\nThis feels similar to the problem of finding the maximum flow or something similar.\n\nBut perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node s has edges to its children (proper superstrings), and the a_s's are constrained by the a_t's of their parents.\n\nWait, perhaps we can think recursively. For a string s of length m, the maximum a_s is the minimum between c_s and 2^{n - m}, but also, it has to be at least the a_t's of all its proper prefixes.\n\nWait, but the a_t's of the proper prefixes are themselves constrained by their own c_t's and their parent constraints.\n\nThis seems circular.\n\nAn alternative idea: The maximum possible a_s is the minimum between c_s and 2^{n - m}, but also, it's the maximum of the a_t's of all its proper prefixes.\n\nWait, no. Because a_s must be >= a_t for all t that are proper prefixes of s.\n\nSo, for each s, a_s can be at least the maximum a_t among all t that are proper prefixes of s.\n\nSo, for each s, the maximum a_s is min(c_s, 2^{n - m}, max{ a_t for t in proper prefixes of s } ).\n\nHmm, but this is still recursive.\n\nWait, perhaps for each s, a_s is the minimum of c_s and 2^{n - m}, and also >= the a_t's of all t that are proper prefixes of s.\n\nThus, for each s, a_s must be >= the maximum of a_t for all t that are proper prefixes of s.\n\nSo, the a_s can be written as a_s = max( a_t for t in proper prefixes of s ) <= a_s <= min( c_s, 2^{n - m} )\n\nBut this is only possible if max( a_t ) <= min(c_s, 2^{n - m} ). Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find the maximum possible F, given the c_s's.\n\nSo, the F is the sum of a_s's, which are constrained as above.\n\nSo, for a given assignment of c_s's, the F is determined by the a_s's, which are each the maximum between their proper prefixes and the min of their c_s and 2^{n - m}.\n\nWait, no. Because for each s, a_s is the maximum of the a_t's of its proper prefixes, but cannot exceed min(c_s, 2^{n - m}).\n\nThus, the a_s is the minimum of min(c_s, 2^{n - m}) and the maximum a_t of its proper prefixes.\n\nWait, that's correct.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nFor each string s in order of increasing length (so that all proper prefixes are processed before s):\n\na_s = min( c_s, 2^{n - m} )\n\nthen, a_s is set to the maximum between a_s and the a_t's of all proper prefixes of s.\n\nWait, no. Because a_s must be >= a_t for all t that are proper prefixes of s.\n\nSo, after setting a_s = min(c_s, 2^{n - m}), we need to ensure that a_s >= a_t for all t that are proper prefixes of s.\n\nIf a_s is already >= all a_t's, then it's fine.\n\nOtherwise, a_s must be increased to the maximum a_t among its proper prefixes.\n\nBut this can't be done if the new a_s exceeds min(c_s, 2^{n - m}).\n\nIn that case, it's impossible to have a valid a_s, which would imply that the c_s's are invalid.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the c_s's are chosen in a way that allows a valid a_s's.\n\nSo, for a given c_s's, it's possible that for some s, the maximum a_t among its proper prefixes is greater than min(c_s, 2^{n - m} ), which would make it impossible to assign a valid a_s, thus making the multiset impossible to construct.\n\nThus, the c_s's must be chosen such that for all s, the maximum a_t of its proper prefixes is <= min(c_s, 2^{n - m} ).\n\nSo, for each s, the maximum a_t of its proper prefixes must be <= min(c_s, 2^{n - m} ), otherwise, it's impossible to construct a valid a_s.\n\nIn that case, for a given c_s's, the a_s's can be determined as follows:\n\nProcess the strings in order of increasing length.\n\nFor each s:\n\nCompute the maximum a_t among all proper prefixes of s.\n\nSet a_s_candidate = min( c_s, 2^{n - |s|} )\n\nIf a_s_candidate < max_a_t, then it's impossible: the a_s must be >= max_a_t, but a_s_candidate is less than that. So the c_s's are invalid.\n\nElse, set a_s = a_s_candidate.\n\nProceed.\n\nThus, the maximum F is the sum of all a_s's.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to choosing the c_s's such that for every s, max_a_t (max of a_t for proper prefixes of s) <= min(c_s, 2^{n - m} ), and then sum a_s's, which are min(c_s, 2^{n - m} ), but possibly increased to the max_a_t.\n\nWait, no: The a_s's are set to the minimum of c_s and 2^{n - m} }, but also must be >= max_a_t.\n\nSo, a_s is the maximum between the max_a_t and min(c_s, 2^{n - m} ), but only if min(c_s, 2^{n - m} ) >= max_a_t.\n\nOtherwise, it's impossible.\n\nSo, for the c_s's to be valid, for every s, the max_a_t of its proper prefixes must be <= min(c_s, 2^{n - m} ).\n\nOnce this condition is satisfied, the a_s's can be computed, and F is the sum of a_s's.\n\nThus, the problem is to find all possible assignments of c_s's such that:\n\nFor every s:\n\nmax_{t is a proper prefix of s} a_t <= min(c_s, 2^{n - m} )\n\nAnd the sum of a_s's is f.\n\nWait, but the a_s's are determined by the c_s's as per the above rules. So, the sum F is a function of the c_s's, given they satisfy the above condition.\n\nBut the problem is to count the number of c_s assignments where the maximum possible F is exactly f.\n\nSo, for each c_s assignment, compute the F as per the a_s rules, and count it if F == f.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nIt seems challenging, but perhaps we can model this as a dynamic programming problem, where we process the strings in order of increasing length, and for each step, track the necessary information about the maxima of the a_t's for the prefixes.\n\nBut given that n is up to 15, the number of strings is manageable.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Enumerate all possible binary strings s of lengths 1 to n. Let's call this list S.\n\n   For each s, compute m = |s|, and compute 2^{n - m}.\n\n   Also, for each s, determine its proper prefixes t.\n\n2. Process the strings in order of increasing length.\n\n   For each string s in this order:\n\n   a. Compute the maximum a_t among all proper prefixes t of s.\n\n      Let's call this max_t.\n\n   b. Set a_s_candidate = min( c_s, 2^{n - m} )\n\n   c. If a_s_candidate < max_t: invalid, reject this c_s assignment.\n\n   d. Else, set a_s = a_s_candidate.\n\n3. Sum all a_s's to get F.\n\nWe need to count the number of c_s assignments where F = f.\n\nBut how do we model this in a way that can be computed efficiently?\n\nGiven that n is up to 15, the number of strings is 2^15 = 32768, which is manageable.\n\nBut the c_s's can be up to 2e5, which is a problem.\n\nWait, but for each s, c_s can be any integer between 0 and k, inclusive.\n\nBut for the a_s to be as large as possible, given the constraints, the c_s's must be set such that a_s is determined as the maximum between the max_t and min(c_s, 2^{n - m} ).\n\nBut for the sum F to be f, the sum of a_s's must equal f.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be viewed as finding all possible c_s's such that when processed in order, the a_s's sum to f.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWe can represent the problem as a DAG where each node represents a string s, and edges represent the constraints between s and its prefixes.\n\nWe need to assign a value a_s to each node, such that a_s >= a_t for all t in s's proper prefixes, and a_s <= min(c_s, 2^{n - m} ), and the sum of a_s's is f.\n\nBut again, how to count the number of c_s's that lead to a valid a_s's summing to f.\n\nPerhaps we can model this using memoization, where for each string s and a certain value of a_s, we track the possible ways.\n\nBut given the size of a_s (up to 2e5), this seems challenging.\n\nAlternative Idea: Think in terms of the constraints on the c_s's.\n\nFor each s, the c_s must be at least the maximum a_t of its proper prefixes, but also at least the required a_s minus 2^{n - m}.\n\nWait, no. Because a_s can be up to min(c_s, 2^{n - m} ), but a_s can be either limited by c_s or by 2^{n - m}.\n\nWait, for a given s, a_s can be any value between max_t and min(c_s, 2^{n - m} ), as long as this interval is valid (i.e., max_t <= min(c_s, 2^{n - m} )).\n\nSo, for each s, c_s can vary between [lower_c, upper_c], where:\n\nlower_c is the minimal c_s such that c_s >= max_t.\n\nBut also, since a_s can be up to min(c_s, 2^{n - m} ), the minimal c_s is max(max_t, a_s - 2^{n - m} )? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each s, the possible c_s must satisfy:\n\nc_s >= a_s_min, where a_s_min is the minimal a_s for s, which is max_t.\n\nAnd c_s can be any value up to min( 2^{n - m}, a_s_max ), but a_s_max is unbounded except by the sum constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the problem as follows:\n\nEach c_s can be any value from 0 to k, but subject to the constraints imposed by the hierarchy of the a_s's.\n\nOnce the c_s's are chosen, the a_s's are determined as a_s = max( max_t, min( c_s, 2^{n - m} ) ), provided that min( c_s, 2^{n - m} ) >= max_t.\n\nIf this is not the case, the c_s's are invalid.\n\nThus, for the sum F to be f, the sum of a_s's (as determined by the c_s's) must equal f.\n\nSo, the problem is to count the number of c_s's (each from 0 to k) such that:\n\n- For every s, a_s is as defined.\n\n- Sum a_s's = f.\n\nBut how to model this efficiently.\n\nPerhaps we can precompute for each s, the possible ranges of a_s, based on the c_s's, and then model the problem as a knapsack-like problem where the a_s's are variables, and the sum must be f.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the a_s's are determined by the c_s's, perhaps for each s, the contribution to F is a function of c_s and the a_t's of its proper prefixes.\n\nBut the a_t's are determined by their own c_t's and their proper prefixes.\n\nThis seems recursive.\n\nAlternative Idea: Think of the problem in terms of the a_s's. For each s, a_s can be any value between a_lower and a_upper, where a_lower is the maximum a_t of its proper prefixes, and a_upper is min(c_s, 2^{n - m} ).\n\nBut a_lower is determined by the c_t's of the proper prefixes.\n\nThus, the problem is to find all possible a_s's (for all s) such that:\n\n1. a_s >= a_t for all t that are proper prefixes of s.\n\n2. a_s <= min(c_s, 2^{n - m} )\n\n3. sum a_s = f.\n\nAdditionally, for each s, c_s must be >= a_s (since a_s = min(c_s, ... )).\n\nBut since c_s can be any value >= a_s, and up to min(c_s, 2^{n - m} ), but the problem is to count the c_s's that result in sum a_s = f.\n\nBut this seems abstract.\n\nPerhaps the key is to model this as a tree-based dynamic programming problem, processing the strings in order of increasing length, and keeping track of the sum of a_s's and the necessary constraints.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nThe strings can be ordered by their lengths, from 1 to n.\n\nFor each string s in this order, when processing s, we know the a_t's for all t that are proper prefixes of s.\n\nSo, for each s, the a_s is determined as the maximum of the a_t's of its proper prefixes, but also can't exceed min(c_s, 2^{n - m} ).\n\nBut since we're trying to compute the sum F, which is the sum of a_s's, perhaps the DP state can track the current sum and the necessary a_s's.\n\nBut with n up to 15 and sum up to 2e5 * 2^15 (since each a_s can be up to 2e5), this is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Precompute for each s, the possible a_s values, and model the problem as a product of possible a_s's for each s, subject to the constraints.\n\nBut the constraints are that a_s >= a_t for t in proper prefixes.\n\nThus, the problem can be modeled as a directed acyclic graph where each node represents a possible a_s value for a particular s, and edges represent transitions to possible a_t values for its children.\n\nBut even this approach seems computationally intensive.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the a_s's are determined by the c_s's, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding for each s, the possible ranges of c_s that would result in a certain a_s.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps for each s, the a_s can be any value in [a_low, a_high], where a_low is the maximum a_t of its proper prefixes, and a_high is min(c_s, 2^{n - m} ).\n\nThus, for the sum F to be f, the a_s's must sum to f, and for each s, a_s must be within [a_low, a_high], and a_high is min(c_s, 2^{n - m} ), which depends on c_s.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each s, the possible a_s can be any value from a_low to a_high.\n\nBut since a_low is determined by the a_t's of its proper prefixes, which are processed earlier, perhaps we can model this as a DP where, for each s, we track the possible a_s values and their contributions to the sum.\n\nLet's try to formalize this.\n\nWe can process the strings in order of increasing length.\n\nFor each s, when processing it, we have to consider all possible a_s values that are between a_low and a_high, where a_low is the maximum a_t of its proper prefixes, and a_high is min(c_s, 2^{n - m} ).\n\nBut since c_s is a variable, perhaps it's better to model the a_s as a function of c_s.\n\nWait, perhaps for each s, the a_s can be any value between a_low and a_high, where a_high is min(c_s, 2^{n - m} ), but c_s",
