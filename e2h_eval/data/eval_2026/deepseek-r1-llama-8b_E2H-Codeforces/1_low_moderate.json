The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I calculate the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. Let's see what the problem says.\n\nThe plate is w rows by h columns. We have k rings to gild. Each ring is a border around an inner rectangle that's getting smaller each time. The first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, and so on. Each ring has a width of one cell.\n\nHmm, so for each ring i (starting from 1), the dimensions of the rectangle are (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h -4*(i-1)). Wait, because each ring reduces both the width and height by 4? Because for each ring, we're adding a border of 1 cell on each side, but since it's two sides, it's 2 cells each for width and height. So each ring effectively subtracts 2 from each dimension, but since each ring is built on the previous, maybe it's more accurate to think that each new ring is 2 cells inside the previous.\n\nWait, the formula given is (w -4*(i-1)) * (h -4*(i-1)), which suggests that each ring reduces both dimensions by 4 per step. So for i=1, it's w x h. For i=2, it's w-4 x h-4. That makes sense because each ring adds a layer, so for the next ring, the rectangle is two cells smaller on each side in both directions.\n\nSo for each ring i, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle, which is 2*(width + height) -4. Because the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(w + h), but since the corners are counted twice, we subtract 4.\n\nWait, let me think: For example, if the rectangle is 3x3, the perimeter is 8 cells. Which matches the first sample input. So yes, that formula works.\n\nSo for each ring i from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the current rectangle and sum them all.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each i from 1 to k:\n   a. Compute current_w = w -4*(i-1)\n   b. Compute current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n   c. If current_w <=0 or current_h <=0, then we can't have a ring here. But according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it won't exceed the possible rings. So perhaps we don't have to handle this case.\n   d. Compute the perimeter: 2*(current_w + current_h -2). Because 2*(w + h) -4 is same as 2*(w-2 + h-2) = 2*(current_w + current_h -2) ?\n\nWait, wait. Let's recalculate. For a rectangle of w rows and h columns, how many cells are on the perimeter?\n\nIn each row, the top and bottom rows contribute h cells each. But the four corners are counted twice, so total is 2*h + 2*(h-2). Wait, no. Maybe it's better to model it as 2*(w) + 2*(h-2). Because for each column, there are w cells, but the two ends are already counted in the rows.\n\nWait, another way: the perimeter is 2*(w + h) -4. Because the total cells in a rectangle is w*h. Subtracting the inner rectangle, which is (w-2)*(h-2), gives the perimeter. So perimeter = w*h - (w-2)*(h-2) = wh - (w h -2w -2h +4) = 2w + 2h -4. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo for each ring i, the perimeter is 2*(w_i + h_i) -4, where w_i = w -4*(i-1), h_i = h -4*(i-1).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Initialize total_gilded = 0\n- For each i from 1 to k:\n   compute w_i = w -4*(i-1)\n   compute h_i = h -4*(i-1)\n   perimeter = 2*(w_i + h_i) -4\n   add perimeter to total_gilded\n- Output total_gilded\n\nWait, but wait. Let's test with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 3 1\n\nFor i=1:\nw_i =3, h_i=3\nperimeter = 2*(3+3)-4=12-4=8 → correct, matches sample output.\n\nSample Input 2:\n7 9 1\n\ni=1: w=7, h=9\nperimeter = 2*(16) -4 =32-4=28 → which",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is a border around an inner rectangle that gets progressively smaller.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Understanding**: The plate is divided into a grid of `w` rows and `h` columns. We need to add `k` gilded rings, each forming a border around an inner rectangle. The first ring is along the edge, the second ring is two cells inside the first, and so on.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring `i`, the dimensions of the current rectangle are `(w - 4*(i-1))` by `(h - 4*(i-1))`. The number of cells in each ring is the perimeter of this rectangle, which can be calculated as `2 * (width + height) - 4`.\n3. **Summing Up**: Sum the perimeters of all `k` rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the values of `w`, `h`, and `k`.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the current width and height of the rectangle.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each rectangle, compute its perimeter using the formula `2 * (width + height) - 4`.\n4. **Accumulate Total**: Sum the perimeters of all `k` rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n5. **Output Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
