There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tennis tournament. Let's break down the problem and think about how to approach it.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem statement again. The tournament is a knockout style, which means each game results in one player being eliminated. The winner continues until they lose. But there's a specific rule here: two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. So, for example, if a player has played 3 games, their next opponent must have either 2 or 3 games played.\n\nThe goal is to find the maximum number of games the winner can participate in. So we want to arrange the tournament in such a way that the winner plays as many games as possible before losing.\n\nLet me look at the examples to get a better idea.\n\nIn the first sample input, n=2, the output is 1. That makes sense because there's only one game between the two players.\n\nFor n=3, the output is 2. How does that happen? Well, the winner could play two games. Like, beat player 2 in the first round, then play against player 3 in the next round. After that, they might not have any more opponents since it's a knockout. Wait, but wait—n=3, the tournament structure would be a bit different. Oh right, maybe the initial rounds are arranged such that the winner can play two matches.\n\nIn the third example, n=4, the output is 2. Hmm, why isn't it higher? Because after playing two games, the winner can't play another because the remaining players might not have enough games under the rule.\n\nWait, the note says that in the third sample, the winner can't play against all players because after beating two others, the next opponent has 0 games played, but the winner already has 2, which is a difference of 2. So that's not allowed.\n\nSo, the strategy seems to involve arranging the tournament in such a way that the winner can play as many games as possible, each time facing an opponent who has either the same number of games or one less than theirs.\n\nI think this is similar to building a binary tree where each node represents a game. The winner needs to climb up the tree, each time choosing opponents that allow the maximum possible games.\n\nBut perhaps a mathematical approach would be better here. Let's model the problem.\n\nLet me denote the maximum number of games the winner can play as k. We need to find the largest k such that with n players, it's possible for the winner to play k games.\n\nEach game the winner plays increases their count by 1. So, for the winner to have k games, they must have beaten k opponents. Each of these opponents must have played a certain number of games before facing the winner.\n\nMoreover, each time the winner plays, the opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games. Because the rule says the difference can't be more than 1.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: when the winner has x games played, their next opponent must have either x or x-1 games.\n\nSo, for the first game, the winner has 0 games, so the opponent must have 0 or 1. But since the winner is starting, the opponent must also have 0 (since they haven't played yet). So the first game is okay.\n\nAfter the first game, the winner has 1 game. Their next opponent must have 1 or 0 games. But since the opponent hasn't played yet, it's 0. So yes, the next opponent can be someone who has played 0 games.\n\nWait, but in that case, the second game would be allowed, because the difference is 1.\n\nSo the second game is allowed. Now the winner has 2 games. Next opponent must have 2 or 1. So, the third game can be against someone who has played 2 games or 1.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the number of games the winner can play is unbounded as long as n allows it. But obviously, for n=1018, it's impossible to have a very high k. So perhaps there's a pattern or formula here.\n\nI recall that this problem is similar to finding the maximum depth of a binary tree where each node can have children based on some constraints. Alternatively, it's similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nWait, thinking again: each step, the winner's next opponent can have either the same number of games as the winner or one less. So, for each new game, the number of required \"supporting\" players depends on the previous steps.\n\nPerhaps, the maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest k such that the sum of a certain series is less than or equal to n-1 (since the winner itself is one player, and each game eliminates one other).\n\nWait, let me model this.\n\nSuppose the winner plays k games. Then, each game adds an opponent that has a certain number of games played.\n\nIn the first game, the opponent has 0 games.\n\nIn the second game, the opponent can have 0 or 1 games. Since the opponent is new, they have 0.\n\nIn the third game, the opponent can have 1 or 2 games. If the winner has 2 games, the opponent must have 1 or 2. So, if the opponent comes from a subtree where they have 1 game, that's allowed.\n\nWait, maybe we can model this as a tree where each node represents a game, and each path from the root to a leaf represents a sequence of opponents the winner has faced.\n\nEach node (game) can have children which are the opponents in the next game. Each child must have a game count that's either equal to or one less than the parent's game count.\n\nSo, the number of nodes in this tree would represent the total number of games played. But wait, no. Because each game is a single match. So each game is represented by a node in the tree, and each node has children which are the next games that the winner can have.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the minimal number of players required to reach k games.\n\nWait, let's consider what's needed for the winner to play k games. For each of the k games, the winner must have faced an opponent. Each of those opponents must have a certain number of games played before facing the winner.\n\nLet me think recursively.\n\nTo have k games:\n\n- The first game: opponent has 0 games. So, the opponent is a single player.\n\n- The second game: the opponent can have 0 or 1 games. But since they are new, it's 0.\n\n- The third game: opponent can have 1 or 2 games. Suppose we take the 1-game path: that opponent could have been a winner of a 1-game match. So, the number of players needed for that path is 1 (their own) + 1 (the opponent) = 2.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me try to model the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games.\n\nLet f(k) be the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games.\n\nWe can try to find a recurrence for f(k).\n\nFor k=1: the winner plays once. They need 1 player (opponent) plus themselves, total 2. So f(1)=2.\n\nFor k=2: the winner plays twice. The first opponent is someone with 0 games. The second opponent can have 0 or 1 games. If they have 1 game, that means that opponent had to play one game before. So the second opponent requires f(1) = 2 players (themselves and their own opponent). So the total players needed would be 1 (winner) + 1 (first opponent) + 2 (second opponent's subtree) = 4. So f(2) =4.\n\nWait, but wait: the first opponent is 1 player. The second opponent is in a subtree where they have played 1 game. To have that, you need 2 players: the second opponent and their own opponent. So the total players for k=2 is 1 (winner) + 1 (first opponent) + 1 (second opponent) + 1 (second opponent's opponent) = 4. So yes, f(2)=4.\n\nFor k=3: the winner plays three times. Each time, the opponent must have a certain number of games.\n\n- Game 1: opponent has 0 games. Requires 1 player.\n\n- Game 2: opponent can have 0 or 1. Let's take 1. So the second opponent must have played once, which requires f(1)=2 players (their own opponent and themselves).\n\n- Game 3: opponent can have 1 or 2. Let's take 2. So the third opponent must have played twice, which requires f(2)=4 players (their own two games and themselves).\n\nSo the total players needed is 1 (winner) + 1 (game 1) + 2 (game 2's subtree) + 4 (game 3's subtree) = 8. So f(3)=8.\n\nWait, that seems like a pattern. Let's see:\n\nf(1) = 2\n\nf(2) = 4\n\nf(3) = 8\n\nHmm, looks like f(k) = 2 * f(k-1). So for k=3, 4*2=8.\n\nWhat about f(4)? Following the same logic:\n\nGame 1: 1 player.\n\nGame 2: opponent has 1 game (needs f(1)=2 players).\n\nGame 3: opponent has 2 games (needs f(2)=4 players).\n\nGame 4: opponent has 3 games (needs f(3)=8 players).\n\nSo total players: 1 +1 +2 +4 +8 = 16. Which is 2^4=16.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be f(k) = 2^k.\n\nBut wait, that's not quite matching for k=3: 2^3 is 8, which matches f(3)=8.\n\nYes, so f(k) = 2^k.\n\nBut wait, for k=0, f(0)=1 (no games, just the winner), but that's not part of the problem.\n\nSo according to this, the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games is 2^k.\n\nBut wait, let's check for k=4. 2^4=16, which seems correct.\n\nSo given n players, the maximum k is the largest integer such that 2^k <= n.\n\nBut wait, let's test this with the examples.\n\nIn the first example, n=2. 2^1=2 <=2, so k=1. Correct.\n\nSecond example, n=3. 2^2=4>3, so the maximum k is 2? Wait, no, wait.\n\nWait, n=3, according to f(k)=2^k, for k=2, we need 4 players. But n is 3, which is less than 4. So the maximum k is 1?\n\nWait, but the sample input for n=3 is 3, and the output is 2. So that contradicts the earlier conclusion.\n\nHmm, so my initial approach may be incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Perhaps the minimal number of players isn't exactly 2^k, but something else.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the problem.\n\nEach time the winner plays a game, their next opponent can have either the same number of games or one less.\n\nSo, for each game the winner plays, the opponent must have a certain number of games. This creates a chain of required players.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the problem as the winner needs to have a binary tree where each node is a game, and each node can have two children (two possible next games) based on the game count.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nAnother approach is to model the problem as follows: the maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest k such that the sum of a certain series is less than or equal to n-1.\n\nWait, because each game eliminates one player, and the total number of games is n-1. But the winner can't play all n-1 games because of the rule.\n\nWait, but the winner can't play more than log2(n) games, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum k is the maximum number such that 2^{k} -1 <=n-1.\n\nWait, for n=3, 2^2-1=3<=2 (n-1=2) → 3<=2 is false. So k=1. But sample says k=2.\n\nHmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative idea: the maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest k where the sum s(k) <=n, where s(k) is the minimal number of players needed.\n\nLooking back, for k=1, s=2.\n\nk=2, s=4.\n\nk=3, s=8.\n\nWait, but for n=3, s(k=2)=4>3, so the maximum k is 1. But the sample shows that for n=3, the answer is 2.\n\nWait, that's conflicting.\n\nSo perhaps the initial assumption about s(k) being 2^k is wrong.\n\nMaybe I should find another way to model s(k).\n\nWait, perhaps s(k) is the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games. Each game the winner plays requires a certain number of players that have played a specific number of games.\n\nLet me think recursively. For each k, s(k) is the minimal number of players required.\n\nTo have the winner play k games:\n\n- The first game: the opponent must have played 0 games. So, that's 1 player.\n\n- The second game: the opponent must have 0 or 1 games. Let's take the 0 case (since that requires fewer players). So, 1 player.\n\nWait, but that's not sufficient because then for the second game, the opponent is a new player. But then, for the third game, the opponent must have 1 or 2 games.\n\nWait, maybe the minimal players for k games is the sum of the players required for each step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each step i (from 1 to k) requires a certain number of players, which is the sum of the previous steps.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a Fibonacci-like sequence.\n\nWait, let's try to compute s(k) for small k.\n\ns(1) = 2.\n\ns(2): The winner plays two games.\n\n- Game 1: opponent A, 1 player.\n\n- Game 2: opponent B, who must have 0 or 1 games. If B has 0, then it's a new player, so total players 1+1+1=3. But wait, can the opponent B have 1 game? Because for that, B must have played one game, which requires another player.\n\nSo for game 2, if the opponent has 1 game, that would require 2 players (B and their own opponent). So the total players would be 1 (winner) +1 (A) +2 (B and B's opponent) =4. So s(2)=4.\n\nSimilarly, s(3):\n\n- Game 1: 1 player.\n\n- Game 2: 1 player.\n\n- Game 3: opponent can have 1 or 2 games.\n\nIf opponent C has 1 game, then it's another 2 players (C and their own opponent). So total players: 1 +1 +1 +2 =5.\n\nBut wait, that's less than the previous approach. Or maybe not. Wait, no: because for game 3, if the opponent has 2 games, that would require 4 players (as per s(2)). So for game 3, taking the opponent with 2 games would add 4 players. So the total players would be 1 (winner) +1 (game1) + 2 (game2's opponent) +4 (game3's opponent) = 8. So s(3)=8.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation for s(3) was 8, which is 2^3=8.\n\nBut for n=3, the sample shows that the maximum games are 2. So perhaps for n=3, the minimal required players is 4, but n=3 is less than that. So the maximum k is 1? But sample shows k=2.\n\nHmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is wrong. Maybe the minimal number of players for k games is s(k) = s(k-1) + s(k-2), or something like that.\n\nWait, let me think of the problem as building a binary tree where each node has children based on the allowed game counts.\n\nEach game the winner plays corresponds to a node, and each node can branch into two children: one for a game where the opponent has the same number of games as the parent, and another where the opponent has one less.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAnother idea: the maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest k such that the sum of a certain series is <=n-1.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nEach game the winner plays, the opponent must have a certain number of games.\n\nThe first game: opponent has 0 games. So, +1 player.\n\nThe second game: opponent can have 0 or 1. Suppose we take 0, then another +1.\n\nThird game: opponent can have 0, 1, or 2.\n\nWait, no. Because the opponent's game count is determined by their own prior games.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is similar to finding the maximum depth of a tree where each node can have up to two children, but each level corresponds to a certain number of players.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the maximum k such that the sum of the Fibonacci-like sequence is <=n.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nBecause for each step, the number of players added could be the sum of the previous two steps.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLet me try to model the problem step by step.\n\nLet’s consider that for the winner to have k games, the opponent in the k-th game must have played k-1 games. Because the difference can be at most 1, and the winner has k-1 games before the final game.\n\nWait, no. Because the winner has played k games. So the opponent in the k-th game must have played either k-1 or k-2 games.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nWhen the winner has x games played, the next opponent must have either x or x-1 games.\n\nSo, for the winner to have k games, each step must satisfy that the opponent has either the same as the current game count minus 1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the game counts as a binary tree where each node has children representing the next possible game counts.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAnother approach: simulate the process.\n\nWe can model the tournament as a binary tree where each node represents a game, and each node has two possible branches: one for the opponent having the same number of games, and another for the opponent having one less.\n\nThe winner's path through the tree represents the games they have played.\n\nThe key is that for each step, the opponent must have a number of games that's within 1 of the winner's current count.\n\nSo, to find the maximum k, we can build a tree where each node at level i has children that correspond to the allowed game counts.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest k where the (k+1)-th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to n.\n\nWait, but let's test this with the samples.\n\nSample 1: n=2.\n\nFibonacci numbers: 1,1,2,3,5,...\n\nWait, for k=1: F(2)=1 <2 → k=1.\n\nSample 2: n=3.\n\nF(4)=3 >=3, so k=2.\n\nSample 3: n=4.\n\nF(5)=5>4, so k=2.\n\nSample 4: n=10.\n\nWhat's the Fibonacci sequence here?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nF(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, F(6)=8, F(7)=13, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum k is the largest m where F(m+1) <=n.\n\nFor n=10:\n\nF(6)=8 <=10.\n\nF(7)=13>10.\n\nSo m=5.\n\nBut the sample output for n=10 is 4.\n\nHmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nSo perhaps this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum k is the largest m where F(m+2) <=n.\n\nFor n=10, F(7)=13>10. F(6)=8<=10. So m=4.\n\nWhich matches the sample output of 4.\n\nHmm, interesting.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFor n=2:\n\nFind the largest m where F(m+2) <=2.\n\nF(4)=3>2. F(3)=2<=2. So m=1. Which is correct.\n\nn=3: F(4)=3<=3, so m=2. Which matches the sample.\n\nn=4: F(5)=5>4. F(4)=3<=4. So m=2. Which matches sample.\n\nn=10: F(6)=8<=10. F(7)=13>10. So m=4, which matches sample.\n\nThis seems promising.\n\nSo the approach is to find the largest m where F(m+2) <=n.\n\nThus, the maximum number of games is m.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the largest m where the (m+2)-th Fibonacci number is <=n.\n\nBut wait, let's check for n=5.\n\nF(6)=8>5. F(5)=5<=5. So m=3.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nLet's see:\n\nn=5.\n\nThe maximum games is 3.\n\nHow?\n\nArrange the tournament so that the winner plays 3 games.\n\n- Game 1: opponent A (0 games).\n\n- Game 2: opponent B (0 games).\n\n- Game 3: opponent C (1 game).\n\nWait, but how do the opponents' game counts build up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Fibonacci approach is correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute Fibonacci numbers up to a certain point (since n can be up to 1018).\n\n2. Find the largest m such that F(m+2) <=n.\n\n3. Return m as the maximum number of games.\n\nSo now, the task is to implement this.\n\nLet me test for n=8.\n\nF(6)=8, which is <=8. So m=4.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nYes, because the winner can play 4 games.\n\nHow?\n\nIt would require 8 players, arranged in a way that each opponent has the required game counts.\n\nNow, let's implement this.\n\nFirst, generate Fibonacci numbers up to the point where F(m+2) exceeds n=1018.\n\nCompute F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, F(6)=8, F(7)=13, F(8)=21, F(9)=34, F(10)=55, F(11)=89, F(12)=144, F(13)=233, F(14)=377, F(15)=610, F(16)=987, F(17)=1597.\n\nSo for n=1018, F(17)=1597>1018. So the largest m where F(m+2)<=1018 is 15, since F(17)=1597>1018 and F(15+2)=F(17)=1597>1018. Wait, wait, wait.\n\nWait, wait, m is such that F(m+2)<=n.\n\nWait, for n=1018, F(16)=987<=1018, F(17)=1597>1018. So m+2=16 → m=14.\n\nWait, no: F(16) is the (16)-th term. So for m+2=16, m=14.\n\nBut F(16)=987<=1018, so m=14.\n\nBut wait, for n=1018, is m=14 the maximum?\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\nCompute F(m+2) for m=14: F(16)=987 <=1018.\n\nm=15: F(17)=1597>1018. So maximum m is 14.\n\nBut according to the earlier approach, the maximum number of games is m=14.\n\nWait, but let's confirm with smaller numbers.\n\nWait, for n=8:\n\nF(6)=8, so m+2=6 → m=4. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the steps to code this are:\n\n1. Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to F(20), as n can be up to 1018.\n\n2. For each test case (n), find the maximum m where F(m+2) <=n.\n\n3. Output m.\n\nNow, code-wise, I can precompute the Fibonacci numbers.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the indices are off. Let me make sure.\n\nCompute F(0)=0, F(1)=1.\n\nThen, for each step, F[i] = F[i-1] + F[i-2].\n\nSo:\n\ni | F(i)\n0 | 0\n1 | 1\n2 | 1\n3 | 2\n4 | 3\n5 |5\n6 |8\n7 |13\n8 |21\n9 |34\n10|55\n11|89\n12|144\n13|233\n14|377\n15|610\n16|987\n17|1597\n\nYes.\n\nSo for n=1018, the largest m where F(m+2) <=1018 is m=14, since F(16)=987 <=1018 and F(17)=1597>1018.\n\nSo for n=1018, the output is 14.\n\nAnother test case: n=987.\n\nF(16)=987 <=987. So m=14.\n\nn=988: F(16)=987<=988 → m=14.\n\nn=1597: F(17)=1597 <=1597 → m=15.\n\nSo code-wise, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the Fibonacci numbers up to say F(20).\n\n- For each input n, iterate from m=0 upwards, checking if F(m+2) <=n. Keep track of the maximum m.\n\nWait, but for larger n, the Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, so the loop will terminate quickly.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute all F(m+2) up to the maximum n (1018), and find the largest m where F(m+2) <=n.\n\nSo the code can be structured as follows:\n\n- Precompute a list of Fibonacci numbers up to F(20) or until F[i] exceeds 1018.\n\n- For each n, find the maximum m such that F(m+2) <=n.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nCompute fibs as a list, where fibs[0]=0, fibs[1]=1, fibs[2]=1, etc.\n\nThen, for a given n:\n\nmax_games = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(fibs)):\n\n    if fibs[i] > n:\n\n        break\n\n    # since fibs[i] is F(i)\n\n    # m+2 = i → m = i-2\n\n    # but we need F(m+2) = fibs[i] <=n\n\n    # So for each i, if fibs[i] <=n, then m = i-2.\n\n    # but m can't be negative.\n\n    if i >=2:\n\n        candidate_m = i-2\n\n        if candidate_m > max_games:\n\n            max_games = candidate_m\n\nreturn max_games\n\nWait, but for i starting from 2.\n\nLet me test this with sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: n=2.\n\nfib list:\n\ni=0:0\n\ni=1:1\n\ni=2:1\n\ni=3:2\n\nAt i=3, fibs[3]=2 <=2. So candidate_m=1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSample Input 2: n=3.\n\ni=3:2<=3 → candidate_m=1.\n\ni=4:3<=3 → candidate_m=2.\n\nSo max is 2.\n\nSample Input 3: n=4.\n\ni=3:2<=4 → candidate_m=1.\n\ni=4:3<=4 → candidate_m=2.\n\ni=5:5>4 → break.\n\nSo max is 2.\n\nSample Input 4: n=10.\n\ni=5:5<=10 → candidate_m=3.\n\ni=6:8<=10 → candidate_m=4.\n\ni=7:13>10 → break.\n\nSo max is 4.\n\nAll samples match.\n\nAnother test: n=8.\n\ni=6:8<=8 → candidate_m=4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nn=5:\n\ni=3:2<=5 → m=1.\n\ni=4:3<=5 → m=2.\n\ni=5:5<=5 → m=3.\n\ni=6:8>5 → break.\n\nSo max is 3.\n\nWhich would imply the winner can play 3 games.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute the Fibonacci numbers.\n\n2. For each n, find the largest m where F(m+2) <=n.\n\n3. Output m.\n\nSo, in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nRead n.\n\nGenerate Fibonacci numbers up to F(20) or until it's beyond 1018.\n\nLoop through the fibs list, for each i >=2, if fibs[i] <=n, set m=i-2.\n\nKeep track of the maximum m.\n\nFinally, print m.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n.\n\nCompute fibs.\n\nLoop:\n\nmax_m = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(fibs)):\n\n    if fibs[i] > n:\n\n        break\n\n    if i >=2:\n\n        current_m = i-2\n\n        if current_m > max_m:\n\n            max_m = current_m\n\nprint(max_m)\n\nTesting this for n=2:\n\nfibs[3]=2<=2 → current_m=1.\n\nfibs[4]=3>2 → break.\n\nmax_m=1.\n\nCorrect.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3:\n\nfibs[4]=3<=3 → current_m=2.\n\nfibs[5]=5>3 → break.\n\nmax_m=2.\n\nCorrect.\n\nFor n=10:\n\nfibs[6]=8<=10 → current_m=4.\n\nfibs[7]=13>10 → break.\n\nmax_m=4.\n\nCorrect.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nThe code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\n# Compute Fibonacci numbers up to F(17) which is 1597, as 1018 is the maximum input.\nfibs = [0, 1]\nwhile True:\n    next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n    if next_fib > 1018:\n        break\n    fibs.append(next_fib)\n\nmax_m = 0\nfor i in range(len(fibs)):\n    if fibs[i] > n:\n        break\n    if i >= 2:\n        current_m = i - 2\n        if current_m > max_m:\n            max_m = current_m\nprint(max_m)\n\nWait, but what about the initial fibs list?\n\nWait, initially, fibs = [0,1]. Then, in the loop:\n\nnext_fib = 0+1=1 → append → fibs becomes [0,1,1]\n\nnext_fib = 1+1=2 → append → [0,1,1,2]\n\nnext_fib=1+2=3 → append → [0,1,1,2,3]\n\nand so on.\n\nSo the list will be built correctly.\n\nBut in the code above, the while condition is 'if next_fib > 1018: break'.\n\nOnce the next_fib exceeds 1018, the loop breaks.\n\nSo for n=1018, the last fib added is 987 (i=16).\n\nThe loop will break when next_fib is 1597>1018.\n\nSo the code correctly includes all fibs up to 987.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given that two players can only face each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the problem can be modeled using Fibonacci numbers. The maximum number of games the winner can play, denoted as `k`, is the largest integer such that the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to the number of players `n`.\n\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: Each game the winner plays requires opponents who have either the same number of games or one fewer game than the winner. This leads us to model the problem using Fibonacci numbers.\n2. **Precompute Fibonacci Numbers**: We precompute Fibonacci numbers up to a point where the next Fibonacci number exceeds the maximum possible input (1018).\n3. **Determine Maximum Games**: For each input `n`, we find the largest `k` such that the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\n\nfibs = [0, 1]\nwhile True:\n    next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n    if next_fib > 1018:\n        break\n    fibs.append(next_fib)\n\nmax_m = 0\nfor i in range(len(fibs)):\n    if fibs[i] > n:\n        break\n    if i >= 2:\n        current_m = i - 2\n        if current_m > max_m:\n            max_m = current_m\nprint(max_m)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of players `n`.\n2. **Generating Fibonacci Numbers**: We generate Fibonacci numbers up to the point where the next number exceeds 1018. This ensures we cover all possible values of `n` up to 1018.\n3. **Finding Maximum Games**: We iterate through the precomputed Fibonacci numbers to find the largest `k` such that the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to `n`. This `k` is the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result by leveraging the properties of Fibonacci numbers and ensures that we handle all edge cases correctly.",
