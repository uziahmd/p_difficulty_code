Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem correctly. The task is to find the maximum possible length of a substring that occurs two or more times in the input string. The occurrences can overlap. For example, in the sample input 'ababa', the substring 'aba' appears twice, overlapping each other. So the output is 3.\n\nLet me consider some examples. If the input is 'abcd', all substrings are unique, so the answer is 0. For 'zzz', the substrings 'zz' and 'zz' appear (overlapping), so the answer is 2.\n\nSo the goal is to find the maximum length L such that there exists a substring of length L that occurs at least twice in the string.\n\nHow do I approach this? One way is to check for all possible substring lengths starting from the largest possible down to 1, and for each length, check if any substring of that length appears more than once. Once I find the maximum L where this condition holds, that's my answer.\n\nThe steps could be:\n\n1. Iterate over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (length of string - 1) down to 1.\n2. For each length L, generate all possible substrings of length L.\n3. Check if any of these substrings appears more than once in the string.\n4. The first L for which this is true is our answer.\n\nWait, but the maximum possible L is len(s)-1 because a substring of length n-1 can't appear more than once since it would require the entire string except one character, but maybe for smaller strings, like length 2, it's possible.\n\nWait, no. For example, in 'aab', substrings 'aa' and 'ab' appear once each, but 'a' appears multiple times. So for L=1, it's possible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop L from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n   Collect all substrings of length L.\n   Check if any of them occurs at least twice.\n   If yes, return L as the answer.\n\nBut how efficient is this? Since the string length is up to 100, it's manageable.\n\nNow, the question is, how to collect all substrings of length L and check for duplicates.\n\nAn approach for each L is:\n\n- Use a set to track the substrings we've seen.\n- For each position i from 0 to len(s)-L:\n   - Extract the substring s[i:i+L]\n   - If this substring is already in the set, then we've found a duplicate, so return True for this L.\n   - Else, add it to the set.\n- If after checking all substrings, no duplicates are found, proceed to the next smaller L.\n\nIf none found for L=1, return 0.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nLet me think about the implementation.\n\nIn Python, for a string s, for each possible L, loop through i from 0 to len(s)-L inclusive. For each i, take s[i:i+L], and see if it's in a set.\n\nWait, but for each L, we process all substrings of that length, and for each, check if it has been seen before. If any of them is found again, then we can return L as the maximum.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nmax_len = 0\nfor L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(0, len(s) - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            return L\n        seen.add(substr)\nreturn 0\n\nWait, but wait: in the code above, for each L, we check all substrings of that length. As soon as any substring is found to have appeared before, we can immediately return L as the answer because we're checking from the largest possible L downwards.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo now, considering the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: 'abcd' → all substrings of length 3 are 'abc', 'bcd' → no duplicates. Then check length 2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' → no duplicates. Then length 1: 'a','b','c','d' → all unique. So output is 0.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa' → for L=3: substrings are 'aba' (i=0), 'bab' (i=1), 'aba' (i=2). When i=2, 'aba' is already in the set, so return 3.\n\nSample 3: 'zzz' → L=2: substrings are 'zz' (i=0), 'zz' (i",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves checking each possible substring length starting from the largest possible down to 1. For each length, we generate all possible substrings and check if any of them appear more than once. The first length for which this condition is met is our answer.\n\n1. **Iterate Over Possible Substring Lengths**: We start from the maximum possible length (length of the string minus 1) and move downwards to 1.\n2. **Generate Substrings**: For each length, generate all substrings of that length.\n3. **Check for Duplicates**: Use a set to track the substrings we have seen so far. If a substring is found again, it means this substring appears at least twice, and we return the current length as the result.\n4. **Return Result**: If no duplicate substrings are found for any length, return 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest valid substring by leveraging a set for quick lookups, making the solution both effective and efficient given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nmax_len = 0\nn = len(s)\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input string is read and its length is determined.\n- **Loop Through Lengths**: We loop from the largest possible substring length down to 1.\n- **Substring Generation and Check**: For each length, we generate all possible substrings and use a set to track seen substrings. If a substring is found in the set, it means it has appeared before, and we print the length and exit.\n- **Efficiency**: This approach efficiently checks each possible substring length, ensuring we find the longest valid substring quickly.\n\nThis solution effectively handles all edge cases and ensures optimal performance within the given constraints.",
