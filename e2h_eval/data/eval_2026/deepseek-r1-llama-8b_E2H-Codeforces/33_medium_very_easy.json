You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to maximize the value of a given integer 'a' by replacing some of its digits with digits from a sequence 's'. Each digit in 's' can be used at most once for replacement. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. The goal is to find the best possible replacements to make 'a' as large as possible. So, I should process each digit of 'a' from left to right, trying to replace it with the largest possible digit available in 's', but only if that replacement will actually increase the number.\n\nWait, right. Because each replacement uses up one digit from 's', I want to use the highest possible digits first on the earliest positions in 'a' where a replacement would give a higher digit.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Sort the sequence 's' in descending order. That way, when I pick a replacement, I'm always choosing the largest possible digit available.\n\n2. For each position in 'a', starting from the left, check if replacing the current digit with the largest remaining digit from 's' will result in a larger number. If yes, do the replacement and remove that digit from 's'. Otherwise, move to the next position.\n\n3. Continue until all digits in 's' are used or all positions in 'a' have been considered.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle cases where replacing a digit doesn't immediately help because a later digit has a higher possibility? Like, maybe skipping a replacement now could allow for a bigger gain later. But no, because the leftmost digits have more weight. So replacing the leftmost possible digit with the largest possible s digit is optimal.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the algorithm steps are:\n\n- Convert 'a' into a list of characters (digits) for easy manipulation.\n- Sort the 's' sequence in descending order.\n- For each index i from 0 to len(a)-1:\n   - Compare the current digit a[i] with the largest available digit in 's'.\n   - If a[i] < s[0], then replace a[i] with s[0], remove s[0] from 's', and proceed to the next position.\n   - Else, move to the next position without using any s digit.\n- Once all possible beneficial replacements are done, stop.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple digits in 's'? For example, if 's' has multiple same digits, like ['9','9'], and 'a' has a digit less than 9 in some position. Then, each such position can be replaced with a 9, using two 9s.\n\nSo, the plan is solid.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is given as two lines: the first is 'a', which can be a very long string. The second is 's', which is a string of digits.\n\nSo, in Python, I can read them as:\n\na = input().strip()\ns = input().strip()\n\nThen, convert 'a' into a list for easy modification.\n\na_list = list(a)\nsorted_s = sorted(s, reverse=True)\n\nNow, create a pointer for the sorted_s. Let's say, we'll iterate through each digit in 'a' and for each, check if the current sorted_s digit is larger than a's digit. If so, replace and pop the first element from sorted_s.\n\nWait, but sorted_s is in descending order, so the first element is the largest. So for each digit in 'a', compare with the first element of sorted_s.\n\nBut wait, after each replacement, the sorted_s changes. So perhaps, we can have a loop that iterates over each character in 'a' and for each, if there's a digit in sorted_s that is larger, replace it and remove that digit from sorted_s.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nfor i in range(len(a_list)):\n    current_digit = a_list[i]\n    if not sorted_s:\n        break\n    if current_digit < sorted_s[0]:\n        a_list[i] = sorted_s[0]\n        sorted_s.pop(0)\n    # else, do nothing\n\nWait, but what if the current digit is equal to the sorted_s's digit? Replacing it won't increase the value, so we shouldn't do it because that would use up a digit that could be useful later. For example, if a is '1234' and s has '5', replacing 4 with 5 is better. But if a is '5555' and s has '5's, then replacing won't help, so we shouldn't use the s digits.\n\nSo the condition is correct: only replace when current digit is strictly less than the s digit.\n\nSo, the code above should work.\n\nOnce all possible replacements are done, join the a_list into a string and output it.\n\nTesting the example:\n\nInput:\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\nWait, the sample input is a bit confusing. Wait, looking back, the input is two lines, the first is a, the second is s.\n\nIn the sample input, a is '1024' and s is '010', but the s is '010', which when sorted becomes ['1','0','0'].\n\nWait no, wait the second line is the sequence s, which is '010', which is '0','1','0', so when sorted in reverse, it's ['1','0','0'].\n\nSo the a is '1024', s is '010'.\n\nProcessing each digit:\n\ni=0: a is '1', s[0] is '1'. So since 1 is not less than 1, we don't replace.\n\ni=1: a is '0'. s[0] is '1' > 0. So replace '0' with '1', s becomes ['0','0'].\n\nNow a is '1124'.\n\ni=2: a is '2', s[0] is '0' which is less than 2. So no replacement.\n\ni=3: a is '4', s[0] is '0' <4. No replacement.\n\nThus, the result is '1124'.\n\nThe other part of the sample is the second test case: a is '987' and s is '1234567'.\n\ns sorted is ['7','6','5','4','3','2','1'].\n\nProcessing a:\n\ni=0: a is '9' vs 7: 9>7, so no replacement.\n\ni=1: a is '8' vs 7: 8>7, no.\n\ni=2: a is '7' vs 7: equal, so no.\n\nSo the output is '987'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: suppose a is '132', s is '99'.\n\nThen, sorted_s is ['9','9'].\n\ni=0: a is '1' <9 → replace with 9, s becomes ['9'].\n\ni=1: a is '3' <9 → replace with 9, s becomes empty.\n\ni=2: a is '2', s is empty → no change.\n\nResult is '992'.\n\nAnother test case: a is '111', s is '111'.\n\nSorted_s is ['1','1','1'].\n\nEach a's digit is 1, which is equal to s's digits. So no replacement. So the result is '111'.\n\nAnother case: a is '123', s is '555'.\n\nReplace 1 with 5, then 2 with 5, then 3 with 5. So result is '555'.\n\nSo the algorithm seems to handle these cases correctly.\n\nWhat about leading zeros? Well, the problem statement says that the output shouldn't have leading zeros. Since the original 'a' doesn't have leading zeros, and any replacement can't add a zero unless it's in the first position and the current digit is higher than zero. Wait, but if the first digit is '1' and s has '0', then replacing would make it '0' which is invalid. So in our algorithm, the first digit can't be replaced with a smaller digit. Because in the code, we only replace when current digit is less than s's digit. So in the first position, if a's digit is '1' and s's digit is '0', since 1>0, we won't replace, so the first digit remains '1' and no leading zero occurs.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nAnother edge case: a is '0' (but according to the problem statement, a is a positive integer without leading zeros, so a can't be '0').\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nNow, writing the code:\n\nRead a and s.\n\nConvert a to a list.\n\nSort s in descending order.\n\nIterate over each character in a:\n\n   if s is empty, break.\n\n   if current digit < s[0], replace and pop s.\n\nFinally, join the a list and print.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the input is given as two strings, each possibly containing newlines. Looking back, the sample input shows:\n\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\nWait, but in reality, the input is two lines: the first is a, which may contain \\n, but no, the problem says the first line is a, which is an integer. So in Python, when you read using input(), it reads the entire line, including any newlines. Wait, but in the sample input, the first line is '1024\\n010'? Or is the sample input a representation?\n\nWait, the problem statement says: the first line contains a, the second line s. So, in the sample input, the first line is '1024' followed by a newline, and the second line is '010' followed by a newline. But the way it's written in the sample is unclear.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the sample input, it's written as:\n\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\nWhich probably represents that a is '1024' and s is '010', but perhaps the actual input is two separate lines, each read via input().\n\nSo in code:\n\na = input().strip()\ns = input().strip()\n\nBecause input().strip() will remove any leading/trailing whitespace, including newlines.\n\nWait, but if a is something like '1024\\n' (with a newline), then a.strip() would become '1024' which is correct. Similarly for s.\n\nSo, in code:\n\na = input().strip()\ns = input().strip()\n\nsorted_s = sorted(s, reverse=True)\n\na_list = list(a)\n\nfor i in range(len(a_list)):\n    if not sorted_s:\n        break\n    if a_list[i] < sorted_s[0]:\n        a_list[i] = sorted_s[0]\n        del sorted_s[0]\n\nresult = ''.join(a_list)\nprint(result)\n\nWait, but what about when s has leading zeros? Like s is '00123', sorted becomes ['3','2','1','0','0']. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: a is '999', s is '9'. Then, since 9 is not less than 9, no replacement happens, so output is '999'.\n\nAnother case: a is '199', s is '9'. Then, the first 1 is less than 9 → replace, a becomes '999'.\n\nAnother case: a is '121', s is '211'. Sorted s is ['2','1','1'].\n\ni=0: a is '1' < '2' → replace with 2, s becomes ['1','1'].\n\ni=1: a is '2' >= '1' → no replacement.\n\ni=2: a is '1' < '1' → no.\n\nSo output is '122'.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nI think this code should handle all cases.\n",
