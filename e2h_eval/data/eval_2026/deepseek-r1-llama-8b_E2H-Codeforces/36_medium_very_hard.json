The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about radio towers in towns. There are n+2 towns, numbered from 0 to n+1. We build a tower in each town 1 to n with probability 1/2, independently. Then, for each built tower, we assign a signal power p (integer from 1 to n). The signal covers all towns c where |c - i| < p, where i is the tower's position.\n\nOur goal is to calculate the probability that after building the towers, it's possible to choose the signal powers such that:\n\n- Towns 0 and n+1 get no signal.\n- Each of the other towns (1 to n) gets exactly one signal.\n\nSo, I need to find the number of subsets S of {1,2,...,n} (representing the built towers) where there's a way to assign p_i to each tower in S such that the coverage is exactly each town once, and towns 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\nThen, the probability is equal to (number of such subsets) / (2^n), since each subset has probability (1/2)^n.\n\nBut wait, how do I count the number of valid subsets S?\n\nHmm, maybe the structure of the valid subsets is similar to certain combinatorial structures, like trees or something else. Let's think about the constraints.\n\nEach town must be covered exactly once. So, for each town j (1<=j<=n), exactly one tower in some i must have i in [j - (p_i -1), j + (p_i -1)]? Or wait, the condition is |c -i| < p_i, so c can be from i - (p_i - 1) to i + (p_i - 1). But also, the towers are placed at the integer points, so let's see.\n\nWait, the coverage for a tower at i with power p is all c where |c -i| < p. Since c is an integer, this means c ranges from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1), inclusive. Because, for example, if p=2, then |c -i| <2 implies c can be i-1, i, i+1.\n\nSo, each tower's coverage is a range of length 2p-1. Now, the entire set of towns 1..n must be covered exactly once by these ranges, and 0 and n+1 are not covered by any.\n\nThis feels similar to tiling the line from 1 to n with non-overlapping intervals, each of which is centered around a tower's position, but perhaps overlapping with others as long as their signals don't cause overlaps in coverage.\n\nWait, no. Because the coverage areas can overlap, but the key is that each town is covered exactly once. So, the ranges must partition the towns 1..n into exactly one interval per town.\n\nMoreover, the ranges cannot include 0 or n+1.\n\nSo, for each subset S, the union of the ranges of the towers in S must exactly cover 1..n, and the ranges must not include 0 or n+1.\n\nAlso, the ranges must not overlap in such a way that any town is covered more than once.\n\nWait, no, because the problem says each town must be covered exactly once. So the ranges must form a partition of 1..n.\n\nThat makes sense. So each range is a continuous segment, and they cover the entire 1..n without overlapping.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of subsets S of {1,2,...,n} such that when you select S, you can assign to each tower in S a radius p_i, so that the coverage intervals form a partition of {1,2,...,n}, and none of the intervals touch 0 or n+1.\n\nNow, the question is: what does such a subset S look like?\n\nHmm, perhaps the towers must form a chain where each next tower's coverage starts right after the previous one's ends. Like, the first tower's coverage ends at some point, the next starts immediately after, and so on.\n\nWait, but the coverage is a range, so the next tower's coverage must start exactly one beyond the end of the previous. Because otherwise, there would be an overlap or a gap.\n\nFor example, suppose we have two towers. Tower A at position a with p_a, covering [a - (p_a-1), a + (p_a-1)]. Tower B at position b with p_b, covering [b - (p_b-1), b + (p_b-1)]. For their ranges to be adjacent, the end of A's coverage plus one must equal the start of B's coverage. So, a + p_a - 1 + 1 = b - (p_b -1) + 1? Wait, no, wait.\n\nWait, coverage is [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)], so the maximum covered town is i + (p-1), and the minimum is i - (p-1). So, the next tower's coverage must start at i + p, so that there's no overlap and no gap.\n\nWait, no. Suppose tower A is at position x, p=x_p. Its coverage is from x - (x_p - 1) to x + (x_p -1). Then, the next tower B must be at position y, such that y - (y_p -1) = x + x_p. Because that way, the coverage of A ends at x + x_p -1, and B starts at y - (y_p-1) = x + x_p, so no overlap.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the coverage of A must end just before the coverage of B begins. So, for two consecutive towers, their positions and radii must satisfy y = x + x_p + 1, and y_p = ... Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the towers form a sequence where each tower's coverage is directly followed by another's, with no gaps or overlaps.\n\nThis structure is reminiscent of a partition into non-overlapping intervals, each defined by a tower, such that the entire 1..n is covered.\n\nSo, perhaps the valid subsets S correspond to certain types of trees or chains, where each tower in S is connected in a way that their coverage intervals form a contiguous block, and the entire 1..n is covered.\n\nWait, perhaps the only valid subsets are those where S forms a single interval of consecutive integers, and within that interval, the towers are placed in a way that their coverage intervals fit together perfectly.\n\nNo, that's probably not the case. For example, in the sample input where n=3, the valid subsets are either {1,2,3} or {2}. For {2}, the radius is 2, so it covers 1,2,3. That works. For {1,2,3}, each has radius 1, so each covers only themselves, thus covering exactly 1,2,3.\n\nSo, the valid subsets can vary in structure.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be modeled using dynamic programming. Let's consider dp[i] as the number of valid subsets for the first i towns.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Another approach is to model the problem as a graph where each node represents a position, and edges represent possible transitions based on the coverage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the valid subsets S must form a certain kind of structure, like a linear chain where each step is determined by the coverage.\n\nWait, another observation: each tower's coverage must exactly cover a certain interval, and the entire 1..n must be covered exactly once. So, the union of all coverage intervals must be exactly 1..n, and the intervals must be non-overlapping and contiguous.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to tiling 1..n with intervals [l, r], each of which is centered at some tower i, such that l = i - (p-1) and r = i + (p-1), and the intervals are exactly covering 1..n without overlapping.\n\nSo, for each interval [l, r], there must be exactly one tower i in [l, r], and the assignment of p must be such that l = i - (p-1) and r = i + (p-1). Which implies that p = r - l + 1. So, the radius depends on the length of the interval.\n\nWait, because l = i - (p-1) and r = i + (p-1). So, the length of the interval is (r - l + 1) = 2p - 1. So, the length is 2p-1, which must be odd. So, each interval's length is an odd number, and p is (length +1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the entire 1..n must be partitioned into intervals of odd lengths, each of which has exactly one tower placed inside it.\n\nSo, each interval must have exactly one tower, and the interval's length is 2p-1, meaning that the length must be odd.\n\nSo, the problem now becomes: how many subsets S of {1,2,...,n} can be partitioned into such intervals, each containing exactly one tower, and the entire 1..n is covered.\n\nFurthermore, the intervals must not include 0 or n+1. So, the first interval must start at 1, and the last interval must end at n.\n\nWait, no: for example, in the sample where n=2, the subset {1,2} has each tower with p=1, so their coverage is [1,1] and [2,2]. So, the intervals are [1,1], [2,2], which are both length 1. So, that's valid.\n\nAnother example is when n=3 and S={2}, which covers [1,3], length 3. So, yes, it's a single interval.\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to counting the number of subsets S of {1,2,â€¦,n} where:\n\n- S can be partitioned into non-overlapping, contiguous intervals [a1, b1], [a2, b2], ..., [ak, bk], such that:\n\n   a1 = 1, bk = n,\n\n   for each interval [ai, bi], ai <= i <= bi,\n\n   for each interval, there is exactly one tower in [ai, bi],\n\n   the length (bi - ai + 1) is odd,\n\n   and the intervals are non-overlapping and cover 1..n.\n\nSo, each interval must have exactly one tower, and the interval's length must be odd.\n\nAdditionally, the intervals must be ordered such that [a1, b1] starts at 1 and ends at some point, then [a2, b2] starts at b1 + 1, etc., until we reach n.\n\nWait, no. Because the intervals must cover 1..n without gaps or overlaps. So, the intervals are ordered and consecutive, starting from 1 and ending at n.\n\nSo, each subset S must consist of exactly one tower in each interval, and the intervals must be of odd length.\n\nSo, the question is, how can we model the number of such subsets S?\n\nLet me think in terms of dynamic programming. Let's define dp[i] as the number of valid subsets for the first i towns.\n\nTo compute dp[i], we can consider all possible j where the last interval starts at j+1 and ends at i, and has an odd length.\n\nBut that might be too slow for n up to 2e5.\n\nWait, but perhaps the intervals are of the form [k, m], where m -k + 1 is odd. And for each such interval, we need to have exactly one tower in [k, m].\n\nSo, for each possible interval [k, m], the number of subsets for the first k-1 towns multiplied by the number of ways to choose a tower in [k, m], and then multiply by the number of ways to arrange the rest.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a tree-like structure where each node represents a possible interval, and its children are the next intervals.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model the problem as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me try to model dp[i] as the number of valid subsets for the first i towns.\n\nFor each i, we can look back to some j, and if the interval [j+1, i] is of odd length, then we can add the number of subsets for the first j towns multiplied by the number of ways to choose a tower in [j+1, i], and ensure that the interval is covered exactly once.\n\nWait, but how do we model the selection of the tower in [j+1, i]?\n\nBecause for each interval [j+1, i], which has length L = i - (j+1) +1 = i -j. So, L must be odd. Let's say L = 2t +1, so t is (L-1)/2.\n\nIn this interval, the tower can be placed anywhere, but it must be such that the coverage exactly spans the entire interval. Wait, no. Because the tower's coverage is [tower_pos - (p-1), tower_pos + (p-1)] = [tower_pos - t, tower_pos + t], since p = t+1.\n\nSo, for the interval [j+1, i], which has length L = 2t+1, the tower must be placed such that tower_pos - t = j+1 and tower_pos + t = i. Solving these gives tower_pos = j+1 + t.\n\nBut since L = 2t+1, t = (L-1)/2. So, tower_pos = j+1 + (L-1)/2.\n\nSo, for each interval [j+1, i], which has length L=2t+1, the tower must be placed exactly at j+1 + t.\n\nBecause only then will the coverage span the entire interval.\n\nSo, for each possible j where i-j is odd, the tower must be placed at j+1 + t, and the subset S must include this tower.\n\nSo, for the interval [j+1, i], the tower is fixed at position j+1 + t. So, for each i, the possible j's are those where i-j is odd, and the tower at j+1 + t must be present in S.\n\nSo, the recurrence could be:\n\ndp[i] = sum over j where i-j is odd, of (dp[j] * product_{k=j+1 to i} [indicator whether the tower at j+1+t is included])\n\nWait, no. Because the inclusion of the tower is part of the subset S, and each interval adds exactly one tower.\n\nWait, perhaps the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i] = sum for each j where (i - j) is odd, and the tower at pos = j+1 + t is included, where t = (i-j-1)/2.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as the number of valid subsets being equal to the (n+1)th Fibonacci number or something similar, but I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: n=2. Output is 1/4.\n\nWhich corresponds to the subsets {1,2} and {2}. So, 2 subsets. 2/4 = 1/2, but the output is 1/4. Wait, no, the sample says that when the towers are built in both 1 and 2, you can set their powers to 1 each, so that each covers only themselves. So, in that case, the subset is {1,2}, which is one possibility. Also, when only {2} is built, and p=2, it covers all three towns. So, that's another possibility. So, total of 2 subsets. So, 2/(2^2) = 1/2, but the sample says the output is 1/4. Wait, no, wait the sample says that for n=2, the real answer is 1/4. Oh right, because the sample says that in 1/4 cases, both towers are built, and the other cases may or may not be valid.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sample says the output is 1/4. So, the number of valid subsets S is 1. Because 1/4 is 1/2^2, so there's only one subset that works.\n\nWait, what's the issue here. For n=2, the valid subsets are:\n\n- Only {2}: the coverage is [1,3], which is exactly 1,2,3. So, this is valid.\n\n- Both {1,2}: each has p=1, so their coverage is [1,1] and [2,2], which covers 1,2 correctly. So, that's another valid subset.\n\nSo, there are two valid subsets. So, the probability is 2/(2^2) = 1/2. But the sample says it's 1/4. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, no, the sample says the real answer is 1/4, but according to my analysis, it's 2/4=1/2. So, I must be misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the valid subsets. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nWait, in the first sample, n=2. The output is 748683265, which is 1/4 mod 998244353. So, the actual probability is 1/4.\n\nSo, why is that?\n\nAh, maybe the valid subsets are only those where the towers are built in a way that their coverage intervals form a specific pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the towers must form a chain where each tower's coverage is exactly followed by the next. Like, the coverage of the first tower ends at some point, the next starts immediately after, etc.\n\nIn the first sample, when the towers are built in both 1 and 2, setting their p to 1 each, their coverage is exactly 1 and 2, respectively. So, this is a valid configuration.\n\nBut when only the tower at 2 is built, p=2 covers 1,2,3. So, that's another valid configuration.\n\nSo, why is the count 2 in this case, leading to a probability of 2/4=1/2, but the sample says the answer is 1/4?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem's setup. Oh wait, no. The problem says that the towers are built in towns 1,2,...,n with probability 1/2 each, independently. So, for each subset S of {1,2}, the probability is 1/4.\n\nSo, in the sample, the valid subsets are {1,2} and {2}, so two subsets. So, the probability is 2/4=1/2. But the sample says the answer is 1/4. So, there's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me re-read it.\n\nOh wait! Wait, the sample says that for n=2, the real answer is 1/4. So, the correct number of valid subsets is 1.\n\nWait, how can that be? Because as I thought earlier, there are two valid subsets.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that each town is covered exactly once, but also that the intervals do not include town 0 or n+1.\n\nWait, in the case where the tower is built only at 2, and p=2, the coverage is 1,2,3. But for n=2, town 3 is not a town. Wait, no: in n=2, the towns are 0,1,2,3. So, town 3 is n+1=3. The problem says that town 3 (n+1) must not receive any signal.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the towns 0 and n+1 (so for n=2, towns 0 and 3) must not receive any signal. So, the tower at 2 with p=2 covers towns 1,2,3. But town 3 is n+1, which must not be covered.\n\nSo, that configuration is invalid. So, the subset {2} is actually invalid because it causes town 3 to be covered.\n\nAh! That's the key. So, in the first sample, when the subset is {2}, the coverage includes town 3, which is invalid. So, that subset is not allowed.\n\nSo, the only valid subset is {1,2}, which doesn't cover 0 or 3.\n\nWait, but {1,2} with p=1 each, covers only 1 and 2. So, that's valid.\n\nSo, for n=2, the only valid subset is {1,2}, so the count is 1. Hence, the probability is 1/4.\n\nThat makes sense now.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the number of subsets S where the coverage of S does not include 0 and n+1, and covers exactly 1..n once.\n\nSo, for each subset S, the union of the coverage intervals must be exactly 1..n, and none of the coverage intervals include 0 or n+1.\n\nTherefore, when considering a tower at i with p_i, the coverage interval is [i - (p_i-1), i + (p_i-1)]. So, for the first tower, i must be >=1, and the coverage [i - (p_i-1)] must be <=1. Similarly, for the last tower, [i + (p_i-1)] must be >=n.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the coverage must not include 0 or n+1. So, for the first tower, the coverage starts at i - (p-1) <=0 is not allowed. So, the first coverage must start at 1. So, i - (p-1) =1.\n\nSimilarly, the last coverage must end at n. So, i + (p-1) =n.\n\nSo, the first tower must be placed such that its coverage starts at 1, and the last tower must have coverage ending at n.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point.\n\nSo, for the entire coverage to not include 0 or n+1, the first coverage must start at 1, and the last coverage must end at n.\n\nSo, the first tower's coverage must be [1, 1 + 2p_1 -2] = [1, 1 + 2(p_1 -1)].\n\nWait, no: the coverage is [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)], so for the first tower, the left end must be 1. So, i - (p-1) =1.\n\nSimilarly, the last tower's right end must be n. So, i + (p-1) =n.\n\nSo, the first tower must be at position 1 + (p-1) = p. Because i = 1 + (p-1) => i = p.\n\nSimilarly, the last tower must be at position n - (p-1) = n - (p-1) = p.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, the first tower's position is p, and the last tower's position is also p.\n\nWait, that can't be unless p is 1, but that's only if n is 1.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe first tower's coverage starts at 1. So, i - (p-1) = 1 â†’ i = p.\n\nSimilarly, the last tower's coverage ends at n â†’ i + (p-1) =n â†’ i = n - (p-1).\n\nBut for the entire coverage to be 1..n, the last tower's coverage must end at n. So, the last tower is somewhere in [k, n], where k is such that k + (p-1) =n.\n\nBut the last tower's coverage must also be exactly the end of the coverage. So, the last tower's coverage starts at s, and ends at n. So, s = (last tower's position) - (p-1), and s must be equal to the end of the previous interval.\n\nWait, perhaps the first tower's coverage starts at 1, and the last tower's coverage ends at n. So, the first tower is at position p, and the last tower is at position q, where q + (p_last -1) =n.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire coverage is a single interval, but that's only possible when all the coverage is contained within 1..n, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, no. Because when the first tower is at position p, and the last tower is at position q, and the coverage of the first tower is [1, 2p-1], and the coverage of the last tower is [n - (p_last -1), n], but how to connect them.\n\nHmm, perhaps the entire coverage is a single interval, which is allowed. For example, when the subset is {2} in n=3. Wait, no, in that case, n=3, and the coverage is [1,3], which is 1..3. So, the first coverage starts at 1, the last ends at 3.\n\nSo, the first tower is at position 2, p=2, so coverage is 1,2,3. So, yes.\n\nIn this case, the first tower's coverage starts at 1, the last ends at 3.\n\nSo, for a subset to be valid, the entire coverage must form a single interval from 1 to n, and the coverage of each tower must fit into this interval.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. So, perhaps the only valid subsets are those where the towers form a single continuous interval, and the coverage is exactly 1..n.\n\nBut that contradicts the first sample where n=2 and subset {1,2} is valid.\n\nWait, no. Because in that case, the coverage is 1 and 2, which is exactly 1..2. So, it's a single interval.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem reduces to the number of subsets S where the coverage is exactly 1..n, and each tower is in a position such that their coverage fits into this interval.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is equivalent to the number of ways to tile the interval [1, n] with intervals of odd lengths, each having exactly one tower inside.\n\nEach interval must have length L = 2k+1, and the tower must be placed exactly at the center of the interval.\n\nSo, for each such tiling, the subset S consists of exactly one tower per interval.\n\nSo, the problem is to count the number of tilings of [1,n] into intervals of odd lengths, each with exactly one tower at their center.\n\nEach such tiling corresponds to exactly one subset S.\n\nSo, the number of valid subsets is equal to the number of ways to partition [1,n] into intervals of odd lengths, where each interval has exactly one tower at its center.\n\nSo, for each such partition, the subset S is the set of centers of each interval.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to counting the number of such partitions.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the number of compositions of n into parts of odd size, where each part is of length at least 1 (since the minimal interval is length 1, which is 2*1-1).\n\nWait, no. Because each part is the length of an interval, which is 2p-1, where p is the radius.\n\nBut the minimal length is 1 (when p=1), which is allowed.\n\nSo, the problem is to count the number of compositions of n into parts of odd positive integers.\n\nBecause each part represents the length of an interval, which is 2p-1 for some p>=1.\n\nWait, for example, n=3 can be composed as 3 (one part) or 1+1+1 (three parts). So, the number of compositions is 2.\n\nWait, but in the sample where n=3, the valid subsets are {1,2,3} (each has p=1, so 1+1+1) and {2} (which covers 3 in length 3). So, that's two valid subsets, which matches the two compositions.\n\nWait, but the sample says that for n=3, the probability is 1/4, which is 2/8=1/4. So, the number of valid subsets is 2.\n\nSo, the number of compositions is the number of ways to write n as a sum of odd positive integers, where order matters.\n\nThe number of compositions of n into odd parts is known. It is equal to the Fibonacci number F(n).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the number of compositions of n into any parts is 2^{n-1}, but into odd parts is a different count.\n\nYes, the number of compositions of n into odd parts is equal to the Fibonacci number F(n+1). For example:\n\nn=1: 1 composition â†’ F(2)=1.\n\nn=2: 1 composition (1+1) â†’ F(3)=2? Wait, no. Wait, for n=2, the number of compositions into odd parts is 1, but F(3)=2. So, perhaps it's F(n).\n\nWait, maybe I should check.\n\nThe number of compositions of n into odd parts is equal to the (n)th Fibonacci number. For example:\n\nn=1 â†’ 1 way â†’ F(1)=1.\n\nn=2 â†’ 1 way (1+1) â†’ F(2)=1.\n\nn=3 â†’ 2 ways (3, 1+1+1) â†’ F(3)=2.\n\nn=4 â†’ 3 ways (1+3, 3+1, 1+1+1+1) â†’ F(4)=3.\n\nYes, that seems to fit. So, the number of compositions of n into odd parts is F(n).\n\nSo, for the problem, the number of valid subsets S is equal to F(n), where F(n) is the nth Fibonacci number, with F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, etc.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, n=2, F(2)=1, which matches the count of 1 valid subset.\n\nIn the second sample, n=3, F(3)=2, which matches the two valid subsets.\n\nIn the third sample, n=5, F(5)=5, but the sample says the answer is 5/32. So, 5/32 is the probability, which is 5/(2^5) =5/32. So, that aligns.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, 2^5 is 32, and 5/32 is indeed the probability if there are 5 valid subsets. So, the number of valid subsets is F(n), and the probability is F(n)/(2^n).\n\nSo, the solution is to compute F(n) modulo 998244353, then compute F(n) * inv(2^n) mod MOD.\n\nBut wait, the sample for n=5 has output 842268673. Let's compute 5/(2^5) mod 998244353.\n\nCompute 2^5=32. The inverse of 32 mod 998244353 is 313606413.\n\nSo, 5 * 313606413 mod MOD.\n\n5 * 313606413 = 1,568,032,065. Now, 1,568,032,065 mod 998244353.\n\nCompute 998244353 * 1 = 998244353. Subtract from 1,568,032,065: 569,787,712.\n\nSo, the result is 569,787,712, which is 569787712. But the sample output is 842268673. So, something is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Because according to the third sample, the output is 842268673, which is 5/32 mod 998244353.\n\nWait, 5 * inv(32) mod MOD.\n\nCompute inv(32) mod 998244353.\n\nWe can compute it using Fermat's little theorem, since MOD is prime.\n\ninv(32) = 32^(MOD-2) mod MOD.\n\nBut let's compute 32 mod MOD is 32.\n\nCompute 32^ (MOD-2) mod MOD.\n\nBut for large MOD, this is manageable with exponentiation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third sample's output is 5/32 mod MOD, which is 5 * 313606412 mod MOD.\n\nWait, 313606412 *5= 1,568,032,060. Mod MOD is 1,568,032,060 - 998,244,353 = 569,787,707.\n\nHmm, but the sample output is 842268673. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong in the initial assumption that the number of valid subsets is F(n).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of valid subsets is the (n)th term of another Fibonacci-like sequence.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Let's think recursively.\n\nLet me denote f(n) as the number of valid subsets for size n.\n\nHow can I express f(n) in terms of f(k) for k <n.\n\nIf I place the first interval as [1, 1], which is length 1 (so p=1). Then, the remaining n-1 towns must form a valid subset.\n\nAlternatively, if I place the first interval as [1, 3], length 3 (p=2). Then, the next interval starts at 4.\n\nWait, no, the first interval can be any length that is an odd number, as long as the entire coverage is 1..n.\n\nWait, perhaps f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-3) + f(n-5) + ... ?\n\nNo, that's more complicated.\n\nWait, let's think about the first interval. The first interval can be of length 1, 3, 5, etc. So, for each possible length l (odd), the first interval is [1, l], and then the remaining n-l towns must form a valid subset.\n\nSo, f(n) = sum_{k=0}^{floor((n-1)/2)} f(n - (2k+1)).\n\nBut for n=1: f(1)=1.\n\nn=2: f(2) = f(1) =1.\n\nn=3: f(3) = f(2) + f(0). Wait, but f(0) is not defined. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) + ... ?\n\nWait, perhaps the recurrence is f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), but that's the Fibonacci recurrence.\n\nWait, for n=1: f(1)=1.\n\nn=2: f(2)=1.\n\nn=3: f(3)=f(2)+f(1)=1+1=2.\n\nn=4: f(4)=f(3)+f(2)=2+1=3.\n\nn=5: f(5)=f(4)+f(3)=3+2=5.\n\nWhich matches the third sample's count of 5, leading to 5/32.\n\nSo, this suggests that f(n) is the nth Fibonacci number.\n\nThus, the initial approach was correct.\n\nSo, the number of valid subsets is f(n) = Fib(n).\n\nBut in the third sample, n=5, Fib(5)=5, which is correct.\n\nSo, the probability is Fib(n) / 2^n.\n\nBut wait, let's verify for n=3:\n\nFib(3)=2, 2/8=1/4, which matches the sample.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to computing Fib(n) mod MOD, then computing Fib(n) * inv(2^n) mod MOD.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute Fib(n) modulo MOD, where MOD=998244353.\n\n2. Compute inv_2n = inverse of (2^n) mod MOD.\n\n3. The answer is (Fib(n) * inv_2n) mod MOD.\n\nBut wait, how to compute Fib(n) efficiently for n up to 2e5.\n\nYes, with O(n) time and O(n) space, it's manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute Fib numbers up to 2e5.\n\n- Compute 2^n mod MOD.\n\n- Compute the modular inverse of 2^n mod MOD.\n\n- Multiply Fib(n) by this inverse, mod MOD.\n\nBut wait, Fib(n) is 1-based or 0-based? Because in our earlier examples, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, etc.\n\nYes, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5.\n\nSo, the code needs to compute the nth Fibonacci number, with Fib(1)=1.\n\nSo, let's proceed.\n\nNow, in Python, for n=2e5, we can compute Fib(n) quickly with a loop.\n\nLet me outline the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nCompute Fib(n):\n\nfib = [0]*(n+2)\n\nfib[0]=0\n\nfib[1]=1\n\nfor i in 2 to n:\n\n    fib[i] = (fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]) % MOD\n\nCompute pow_2 = 2^n mod MOD.\n\nCompute inv_pow_2 = pow(pow_2, MOD-2, MOD).\n\nans = (fib[n] * inv_pow_2) % MOD.\n\nPrint ans.\n\nTesting for n=2:\n\nfib[2]=1.\n\npow_2=4.\n\ninv_pow_2=748683265 (since 4*748683265 mod MOD=1).\n\nans=1 * 748683265 mod MOD =748683265.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nn=3:\n\nfib[3]=2.\n\npow",
