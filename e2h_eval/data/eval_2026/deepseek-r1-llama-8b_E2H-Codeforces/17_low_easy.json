He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether it's a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. The output is a string where each character is either 'P' or 'S' based on that classification.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. The main idea is that for each possible string length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings: one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. But wait, no—wait, the problem says that each length from 1 to n-1 has exactly two strings, but they could be both prefixes, both suffixes, or one of each. No, no, wait: Ivan provided all improper prefixes and suffixes, so for each length l (1<=l<=n-1), there are two strings: one is a prefix, the other is a suffix.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that Ivan told you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes, meaning that for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings in the input: one is a prefix, the other is a suffix. So for each length l, there's two entries in the input, one P and one S.\n\nSo, for each input string, I need to determine if it's a prefix or a suffix.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me consider the structure of the original string s. Let's denote s as s_0 s_1 ... s_{n-1}.\n\nThe prefixes are s[0..0], s[0..1], ..., s[0..n-2]. The suffixes are s[1..n-1], s[2..n-1], ..., s[n-1].\n\nNow, for each possible l (length), the two strings provided are the prefix of length l and the suffix of length l. So, for example, for l=1, the two strings would be s[0] and s[-1], right? Because the suffix of length 1 is the last character.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the suffix of length l is the substring ending at the end of the string, starting at position n-l. So for l=1, it's s[-1], which is s[n-1]. So for l=1, the two strings are s[0] (prefix) and s[n-1] (suffix).\n\nSimilarly, for l=2, the prefix is s[0..1], the suffix is s[n-2..n-1].\n\nSo, the key idea is that for each l, the two strings of that length must satisfy that one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. Moreover, these two strings must match the correct parts of s.\n\nBut how can we figure out which is which?\n\nAnother observation: the suffix of length l is the reverse of the prefix of length l when considering the entire string. Or wait, perhaps not directly. But maybe the suffix of length l is equal to the prefix of length l of some reversed string.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible l, the suffix of length l must be equal to the prefix of length l of the overall string. Because s's suffix is s[n-l..n-1], and the prefix is s[0..l-1]. So, for the two strings of length l, one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. How do we determine which is which?\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, the suffix of length l is the reverse of the prefix of length l. Or maybe not. Hmm.\n\nWait, for example, take s = \"ababa\". For l=3, the prefix is \"aba\", the suffix is \"aba\" as well. So in this case, both are the same. So that suggests that sometimes the suffix and prefix of the same length can be the same.\n\nBut in general, how do the two strings of length l relate? Well, the prefix is s[0..l-1], the suffix is s[n-l..n-1]. So for them to fit into the original string, the suffix must be such that when combined with the prefix, they form the entire string s.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to find, for each l, the two strings of that length, and see which one can be the prefix and which the suffix in a way that allows the full string to exist.\n\nWait, but how? Because for each l, the two strings must be the prefix and suffix. So for each l, there are two possibilities: either the first string is the prefix and the second is the suffix, or vice versa.\n\nBut then, how to decide which is which for all l's together.\n\nAnother thought: For each l, the prefix of length l must be a prefix of the string, and the suffix of length l must be a suffix.\n\nBut more importantly, for the entire string s, the suffix of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether it is a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. The output is a string where each character is either 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix) based on the classification.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Prefixes and Suffixes**: For a string `s` of length `n`, prefixes are substrings starting from the beginning up to any point before the end, and suffixes are substrings ending at the end up to any point before the beginning. Each length from 1 to n-1 has exactly two strings: one is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\n2. **Identifying the Original String**: The key insight is that for each length `l` (from 1 to n-1), there are two strings in the input. One will be the prefix of length `l` and the other will be the suffix of length `l`. \n\n3. **Matching Prefixes and Suffixes**: For each possible length `l`, we need to determine which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix. This can be done by checking if the suffix of length `l` matches the prefix of the same length when considering the entire string.\n\n4. **Constructing the Result String**: We construct the result string by iterating through all provided strings and marking each as 'P' or 'S' based on whether it is identified as a prefix or suffix.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nstrings = []\nfor _ in range(2 * n - 2):\n    s = input().strip()\n    strings.append(s)\n\n# Create a dictionary to map lengths to their strings\nlength_map = {}\nfor s in strings:\n    l = len(s)\n    if l not in length_map:\n        length_map[l] = []\n    length_map[l].append(s)\n\n# Now, for each length l, determine which is prefix and which is suffix\nresult = []\nfor l in range(1, n):\n    candidates = length_map[l]\n    # There are two candidates for each l\n    # We need to find which one is the prefix and which is the suffix\n    # The suffix must start with the last character of the prefix\n    # Or, more accurately, the suffix must be the last part of the string\n    # Let's consider possible combinations\n    # Try candidate1 as prefix and candidate2 as suffix\n    prefix_candidate1 = candidates[0]\n    suffix_candidate1 = candidates[1]\n    # Check if the suffix_candidate1 matches the suffix part when the prefix_candidate1 is taken\n    # The full string would be prefix_candidate1 + some middle part + suffix_candidate1\n    # So, the first l characters should be prefix_candidate1, the last l should be suffix_candidate1\n    # But without knowing the middle part, it's tricky. So perhaps another approach.\n    # Alternatively, for each possible pair, see if the suffix_candidate can be the suffix of the string formed by prefix_candidate + something\n    # But that's complicated.\n    # Another approach: for each possible l, the suffix must be such that when combined with the prefix, they form a consistent string.\n    # So, for each possible l, the suffix must be equal to the prefix of length l of the original string reversed?\n    # Not sure. Maybe try both possibilities and see which one fits.\n\n    # Try both possibilities\n    for p, s in [(candidates[0], candidates[1]), (candidates[1], candidates[0])]:\n        # Check if the suffix s can be the suffix of the string formed by p followed by some middle\n        # The suffix s must match the last l characters of the full string\n        # But since the full string is unknown, how to check?\n        # Wait, perhaps the correct way is to ensure that the suffix s is a suffix of the string formed by p concatenated with some middle.\n        # However, without knowing the middle, this is challenging.\n        # Instead, maybe we can use the fact that for the correct assignment, the suffix s must be such that when the prefix p is taken, the entire string can be formed correctly.\n\n        # Another idea: the suffix of length l must be the substring s[n-l:]. If we assume that the prefix is p, then the suffix must be the last l characters of s.\n        # Similarly, if we assume that the suffix is s, then the prefix must be the first l characters of s.\n        # So, for the correct assignment, one of the following must hold:\n        # p == s[n-l:] (if s is the suffix)\n        # or s == s_full[:l] (if s is the prefix)\n\n        # Wait, perhaps for each possible assignment, check if the suffix s is the suffix of p followed by some middle string.\n\n        # Alternatively, since the full string is built from these parts, maybe for each possible assignment, check if the suffix can fit after the prefix.\n\n        # Let's try the first assignment: p is the prefix, s is the suffix.\n        # Then, the full string would be p + middle + s, where middle is some string of length n-2*l.\n        # But without knowing middle, how to verify?\n\n        # Hmm, maybe a smarter approach is needed. Let's think about the relationship between the prefix and suffix of the same length l.\n\n        # Suppose the correct assignment is that the first string is the prefix and the second is the suffix. Then, the prefix must be the first l characters of the string, and the suffix must be the last l characters.\n\n        # So, for the string s, the prefix p must be equal to s[:l], and the suffix s must be equal to s[-l:].\n\n        # Therefore, for each possible assignment, check if p is the prefix and s is the suffix by comparing with the full string.\n\n        # But since we don't know the full string, this is tricky. Alternatively, for each possible assignment, we can check if the suffix s can be obtained by taking the last l characters of a string that starts with p.\n\n        # So, let's suppose that the full string is p + middle + s_suffix. Then, the last l characters must be s_suffix. So, for our purposes, we just need to ensure that s_suffix is the last l characters of some string that starts with p.\n\n        # But how? We don't know the middle.\n\n        # Maybe we can construct a possible full string by concatenating p and s, but that might not work because the middle part could interfere.\n\n        # Alternatively, for the correct assignment, the suffix s must be equal to the prefix of the same length when the full string is considered.\n\n        # Wait, perhaps for each l, the suffix must be equal to the prefix of the same length when the full string is reversed.\n\n        # Not necessarily. For example, if the full string is \"ababa\", the suffix of length 3 is \"aba\" and the prefix of length 3 is \"aba\". So in this case, they are the same.\n\n        # So, the key is that for each l, the suffix of length l is the substring s[n-l..n-1], and the prefix is s[0..l-1]. So, for each l, the two strings must be such that one is the prefix and the other is the suffix.\n\n        # Therefore, for each l, the two strings must satisfy that one is the prefix and the other is the suffix, meaning that for some full string, one is the first l characters and the other is the last l characters.\n\n        # To determine which is which, perhaps the correct way is to check if the suffix can be the suffix of a string formed by the prefix plus some middle string.\n\n        # But without knowing the middle string, this is difficult. So, perhaps for each l, we can try both possibilities and see which one leads to a valid full string.\n\n        # Let's proceed by trying both possibilities for each l and see which one allows us to build a consistent full string.\n\n        # So, for each l, we have two candidates: p and s.\n\n        # Try candidate1 as prefix and candidate2 as suffix:\n        # The full string would be p + middle + candidate2.\n        # The prefix of length l is p, so the first l characters must be p.\n        # The suffix of length l is candidate2, so the last l characters must be candidate2.\n\n        # Since the full string is not known, perhaps the only thing we can check is whether the candidate2 is the suffix of a string that starts with p.\n\n        # How? Well, if we take p as the prefix and candidate2 as the suffix, the full string must be p followed by some string of length (n - l), and ending with candidate2.\n\n        # So, the minimum requirement is that the candidate2 must be a suffix of the string formed by p concatenated with any possible middle string.\n\n        # But since any middle string is possible, as long as the candidate2 matches the last l characters, it's acceptable.\n\n        # Therefore, for each l, we can arbitrarily assign p as the prefix and s as the suffix, or vice versa, as long as the resulting assignments are consistent across all l.\n\n        # Given the complexity, perhaps the best approach is to build the result by checking for each string whether it can be a prefix or a suffix based on the constraints.\n\n        # Here's a plan:\n        # For each string, determine if it's a prefix by checking if there exists a string such that this string is the prefix and another string is the suffix.\n        # But this seems too vague.\n\n        # Alternatively, for each string, if it can be a prefix, then the suffix of the same length must be present and compatible.\n\n        # Wait, perhaps a better approach is to realize that the full string can be uniquely determined by the given prefixes and suffixes, and then we can reconstruct it.\n\n        # Once the full string is reconstructed, we can then assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string based on whether it matches the corresponding prefix or suffix.\n\n        # So, the steps would be:\n        # 1. Determine the full string s.\n        # 2. For each input string, check if it is a prefix or suffix of s.\n        # 3. Construct the result string accordingly.\n\n        # The challenge is step 1: determining s.\n\n        # How to reconstruct s?\n\n        # Let's think about the prefixes and suffixes. For each length l, there are two strings: one is the prefix, the other is the suffix.\n\n        # So, for l=1, the two strings are s[0] and s[-1]. For l=2, the two strings are s[0..1] and s[-2..-1], etc.\n\n        # Therefore, for each l, the prefix and suffix must satisfy that the suffix is the reverse of the prefix when considering the entire string.\n\n        # Wait, no. Because the suffix is the last l characters, which may not be the reverse of the prefix.\n\n        # Hmm.\n\n        # Perhaps the way to reconstruct s is by considering that for each l, the suffix must be equal to the last l characters of the full string, and the prefix must be equal to the first l characters.\n\n        # Therefore, for l=1, the suffix is s[-1], which must be one of the two strings provided. Similarly, the prefix is s[0].\n\n        # So, for each l, the two strings must be such that one is the first l characters and the other is the last l characters of the full string.\n\n        # Thus, to reconstruct the full string, we can try to find a string s where for each l, the l-length prefix is one of the two strings, and the l-length suffix is the other.\n\n        # This seems like a constraint satisfaction problem, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\n        # Let's try to reconstruct the full string step by step.\n\n        # Start with the smallest l, l=1. There are two strings: one is the prefix (s[0]), the other is the suffix (s[-1]).\n\n        # So, the full string s starts with one of them and ends with the other.\n\n        # But since the full string is of length n, which is longer than l=1, we need to find a consistent way to extend this.\n\n        # Alternatively, perhaps for each l, the suffix of length l must be equal to the prefix of length l of the full string reversed.\n\n        # No, that doesn't necessarily hold.\n\n        # Maybe another approach is needed.\n\n        # Let's think about the example given:\n\n        # Example 1:\n        # Input:\n        # ['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n        # Output: 'SPPSPSPS'\n\n        # The only possible string is \"ababa\".\n\n        # So, for l=1, the two strings are 'a' (prefix) and 'a' (suffix). Wait, but both are 'a', so how to differentiate?\n\n        # Wait, perhaps in cases where both strings are the same, they could both be the same part (either both prefix or both suffix), but that's impossible because each length has exactly one prefix and one suffix.\n\n        # So, perhaps for each l, the two strings are different, and one is the prefix and the other is the suffix.\n\n        # So, back to the approach: for each l, the two strings are the prefix and suffix of the same length. We need to determine which is which.\n\n        # For each l, the suffix must be a suffix of the full string, and the prefix must be a prefix.\n\n        # So, for each l, we can check the two possible assignments and see which one leads to a consistent full string.\n\n        # Once the full string is determined, we can mark each string as 'P' or 'S' based on whether it matches the prefix or suffix.\n\n        # So, the plan is:\n\n        # 1. For each l from 1 to n-1:\n            # a. Get the two strings of length l.\n            # b. Try both possibilities: first as prefix and second as suffix, and vice versa.\n            # c. For each possibility, check if the full string can be formed consistently.\n\n        # 2. Once the full string is determined, create the result string by checking each input string against the full string.\n\n        # The challenge is step 1c: how to check if a given assignment is consistent.\n\n        # Let's think about how to check consistency.\n\n        # Suppose for l=1, we have two strings: 'a' and 'a'. Both are the same, so one must be the prefix and the other the suffix.\n\n        # So, the full string starts and ends with 'a'.\n\n        # For l=2, suppose the two strings are 'ab' and 'ba'.\n\n        # Trying 'ab' as prefix and 'ba' as suffix: the full string would be 'ab...ba'. The last two characters are 'ba', which is the suffix. The first two are 'ab', which is the prefix.\n\n        # So, for l=2, this is consistent.\n\n        # Now, how to model this in code.\n\n        # We can represent the full string as a list, and for each l, update it based on the current assignment.\n\n        # Initialize the full string as empty.\n\n        # For l from 1 to n-1:\n            # Take the two strings for length l.\n            # Try both possible assignments: p is prefix, s is suffix; or s is prefix, p is suffix.\n            # For each assignment, check if the current full string can be extended correctly.\n\n        # So, for example, for l=1, the full string is initially empty. Assigning 'a' as prefix and 'a' as suffix implies the full string starts and ends with 'a'.\n\n        # For l=2, the full string would be 'ab' + middle + 'ba', where middle is a string of length n-4 (if n>4). But without knowing middle, we can't directly verify.\n\n        # Hmm, perhaps the approach is to build the full string incrementally, ensuring that for each l, the assignment is consistent with the previous assignments.\n\n        # Let's try to model this.\n\n        # Initialize full_str as an empty string.\n\n        # For l in increasing order from 1 to n-1:\n            # Get the two strings of length l: p and s.\n            # Consider both possible assignments: p as prefix, s as suffix; or s as prefix, p as suffix.\n            # For each assignment, check if it is compatible with the current full_str.\n\n            # For the assignment where p is the prefix:\n                # The first l characters of full_str must be p.\n                # The last l characters must be s.\n                # Also, the length of full_str must be >= l (since we're building it incrementally).\n                # The first l characters must match p.\n                # The last l characters must match s.\n                # Additionally, if the full_str has a length greater than l, the middle part (full_str[l:-l]) must be such that the next step's assignment is possible.\n\n            # For the assignment where s is the prefix:\n                # Similar checks apply.\n\n            # Choose the assignment that allows the full_str to be built correctly.\n\n        # Once the full_str is determined, we can then create the result string by checking each input string.\n\n        # So, let's try to implement this.\n\n        # But how to handle the full_str building.\n\n        # Let's consider an example.\n\n        # Example 2:\n        # Input:\n        # 3\n        # a\n        # aa\n        # aa\n        # a\n\n        # Output:\n        # PPS\n\n        # The full string is \"aaa\".\n\n        # For l=1, the two strings are 'a' (prefix) and 'a' (suffix). So, full_str starts as 'a'.\n\n        # For l=2, the two strings are 'aa' (prefix) and 'aa' (suffix). So, the full_str must be 'aaa'.\n\n        # So, during the process:\n            # l=1: full_str is 'a'.\n            # l=2: check both assignments.\n                # Assign 'aa' as prefix: full_str becomes 'aa', but then the suffix 'aa' would require the last two characters to be 'aa', which is true.

Determine the full string s.\n        # 2. For each input string, check if it is a prefix or suffix of s.\n        # 3.

Because the suffix is the last l characters, which may not be the reverse of the prefix.\n\n        # Hmm.\n\n        # Perhaps the way to reconstruct s is by considering that for each l, the suffix must be equal to the last l characters of the full string, and the prefix must be equal to the first l characters.\n\n        # Therefore, for l=1, the suffix is s[-1], which must be one of the two strings provided. Similarly, the prefix is s[0].\n\n        # So, for each l, the two strings must be such that one is the first l characters and the other is the last l characters of the full string.\n\n        # Thus, to reconstruct the full string, we can try to find a string s where for each l, the l-length prefix is one of the two strings, and the l-length suffix is the other.\n\n        # This seems like a constraint satisfaction problem, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\n        # Let's try to reconstruct the full string step by step.\n\n        # Start with the smallest l, l=1. There are two strings: one is the prefix (s[0]), the other is the suffix (s[-1]).\n\n        # So, the full string s starts with one of them and ends with the other.\n\n        # But since the full string is of length n, which is longer than l=1, we need to find a consistent way to extend this.\n\n        # Alternatively, perhaps for each l, the suffix of length l must be equal to the prefix of length l of the full string reversed.\n\n        # No, that doesn't necessarily hold.\n\n        # Maybe another approach is needed.\n\n        # Let's think about the example given:\n\n        # Example 1:\n        # Input:\n        # ['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n        # Output: 'SPPSPSPS'\n\n        # The only possible string is \"ababa\".\n\n        # So, for l=1, the two strings are 'a' (prefix) and 'a' (suffix). Wait, but both are 'a', so how to differentiate?\n\n        # Wait, perhaps in cases where both strings are the same, they could both be the same part (either both prefix or both suffix), but that's impossible because each length has exactly one prefix and one suffix.\n\n        # So, perhaps for each l, the two strings are different, and one is the prefix and the other is the suffix.\n\n        # So, back to the approach: for each l, the two strings are the prefix and suffix of the same length. We need to determine which is which.\n\n        # For each l, the suffix must be a suffix of the full string, and the prefix must be a prefix.\n\n        # So, for each l, we can check the two possible assignments and see which one leads to a consistent full string.\n\n        # Once the full string is determined, we can mark each string as 'P' or 'S' based on whether it matches the prefix or suffix.\n\n        # So, the plan is:\n\n        # 1. For each l from 1 to n-1:\n            # a. Get the two strings of length l.\n            # b. Try both possibilities: first as prefix and second as suffix, and vice versa.\n            # c. For each possibility, check if the full string can be formed consistently.\n\n        # 2. Once the full string is determined, create the result string by checking each input string against the full string.\n\n        # The challenge is step 1c: how to check if a given assignment is consistent.\n\n        # Let's think about how to check consistency.\n\n        # Suppose for l=1, we have two strings: 'a' and 'a'. Both are the same, so one must be the prefix and the other the suffix.\n\n        # So, the full string starts and ends with 'a'.\n\n        # For l=2, suppose the two strings are 'ab' and 'ba'.\n\n        # Trying 'ab' as prefix and 'ba' as suffix: the full string would be 'ab...ba'. The last two characters are 'ba', which is the suffix. The first two are 'ab', which is the prefix.\n\n        # So, for l=2, this is consistent.\n\n        # Now, how to model this in code.\n\n        # We can represent the full string as a list, and for each l, update it based on the current assignment.\n\n        # Initialize the full string as empty.\n\n        # For l from 1 to n-1:\n            # Take the two strings for length l.\n            # Try both possible assignments: p is prefix, s is suffix; or s is prefix, p is suffix.\n            # For each assignment, check if the current full string can be extended correctly.\n\n        # So, for example, for l=1, the full string is initially empty. Assigning 'a' as prefix and 'a' as suffix implies the full string starts and ends with 'a'.\n\n        # For l=2, the full string would be 'ab' + middle + 'ba', where middle is a string of length n-4 (if n>4). But without knowing middle, we can't directly verify.\n\n        # Hmm, perhaps the approach is to build the full string incrementally, ensuring that for each l, the assignment is consistent with the previous assignments.\n\n        # Let's try to model this.\n\n        # Initialize full_str as an empty string.\n\n        # For l in increasing order from 1 to n-1:\n            # Get the two strings of length l: p and s.\n            # Consider both possible assignments: p as prefix, s as suffix; or s as prefix, p as suffix.\n            # For each assignment, check if it is compatible with the current full_str.\n\n            # For the assignment where p is the prefix:\n                # The first l characters of full_str must be p.\n                # The last l characters must be s.\n                # Also, the length of full_str must be >= l (since we're building it incrementally).\n                # The first l characters must match p.\n                # The last l characters must match s.\n                # Additionally, if the full_str has a length greater than l, the middle part (full_str[l:-l]) must be such that the next step's assignment is possible.\n\n            # For the assignment where s is the prefix:\n                # Similar checks apply.\n\n            # Choose the assignment that allows the full_str to be built correctly.\n\n        # Once the full_str is determined, we can then create the result string by checking each input string.\n\n        # So, let's try to implement this.\n\n        # But how to handle the full_str building.\n\n        # Let's consider an example.\n\n        # Example 2:\n        # Input:\n        # 3\n        # a\n        # aa\n        # aa\n        # a\n\n        # Output:\n        # PPS\n\n        # The full string is \"aaa\".\n\n        # For l=1, the two strings are 'a' (prefix) and 'a' (suffix). So, full_str starts as 'a'.\n\n        # For l=2, the two strings are 'aa' (prefix) and 'aa' (suffix). So, the full_str must be 'aaa'.\n\n        # So, during the process:\n            # l=1: full_str is 'a'.\n            # l=2: check both assignments.\n                # Assign 'aa' as prefix: full_str becomes 'aa', but then the suffix 'aa' would require the last two characters to be 'aa', which is true.
