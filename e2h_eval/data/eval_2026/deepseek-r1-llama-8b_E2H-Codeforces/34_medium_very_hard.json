And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the average sleep time per week for Polycarp based on his sleep records over n days. Each week consists of k consecutive days. So there are (n - k + 1) possible weeks. For each week, we sum the sleep times of those k days and then compute the average by dividing the total sum by the number of weeks.\n\nHmm, right. The input gives n and k, followed by a list of a1 to an. The output should be the average with at least six decimal places.\n\nLet's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to process all possible consecutive k-day windows in the array a. For each window, calculate the sum of its elements, add all these sums together, and then divide by the number of windows to get the average.\n\nBut wait, if n is up to 2e5, doing this naively by iterating through each window and summing each time would take O(nk) time, which could be up to 2e10 operations. That's way too slow for Python; it won't handle that in reasonable time.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way to compute the sums. Oh right, the sliding window technique can help here. Because each new window only adds one element and removes the first element from the previous window.\n\nWait, but the sliding window for sum works when we can compute the current sum quickly. So the initial sum is the sum of the first k elements. Then, for each subsequent window, subtract the element leaving the window and add the new element entering.\n\nYes, that's the way to go. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Read n, k and the array a.\n2. Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n3. The total sum starts as this initial sum.\n4. Then, for each i from k to n-1:\n   a. Subtract a[i - k] from the current sum.\n   b. Add a[i] to the current sum.\n   c. Add this new current sum to the total sum.\n5. After processing all windows, divide the total sum by the number of windows (n - k + 1) to get the average.\n6. Output the result with six decimal places.\n\nWait, no. Because each window contributes its sum to the total, which is then divided by the number of windows. So the total sum is the sum of all individual window sums.\n\nSo yes, the initial sum is the first window, then for each next window, we update the current sum and add it to the total.\n\nThat makes sense. So the algorithm is O(n) time, which is acceptable for n=2e5.\n\nNow, considering the data types: since the numbers can be up to 1e5 and n is up to 2e5, the maximum sum could be up to 2e10. Summed over 2e5 windows, the total sum could be up to 2e15, which fits into a 64-bit integer, so using integers for the sum is okay.\n\nIn Python, integers can handle that without any issues.\n\nThen, after computing the total, we need to compute the average as total / (n - k + 1). We have to make sure to output this with at least six decimal places.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the third case has 8 days, k=2, so 7 weeks. The sum is 1+2+4+100000+123+456+789+1. Wait, no, wait. Wait, n is 8, k is 2, so the windows are [1,2], [2,4], [4,100000], etc., up to [1,8]. So the sum is 3 + 6 + ... etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nLooking at the first sample:\n\nInput is 3 2, and a = [3,4,7].\n\nThe windows are [3,4] and [4,7]. Their sums are 7 and 11. Total is 18. Divided by 2 weeks, average is 9.0. So output is 9.0000000000.\n\nYes, that matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: input is 1 1, a is [10]. Only one window, so average is 10.0.\n\nThird sample: 8 2, a is [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]. So 7 windows.\n\nCompute each window sum:\n\n1+2 =3\n\n2+4=6\n\n4+100000=100004\n\n100000+123=100123\n\n123+456=579\n\n456+789=1245\n\n789+1=790\n\nWait, no. Wait, the windows are:\n\n1-2: 1+2=3\n\n2-3: 2+4=6\n\n3-4:4+100000=100004\n\n4-5:100000+123=100123\n\n5-6:123+456=579\n\n6-7:456+789=1245\n\n7-8:789+1=790\n\nTotal sum is 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790. Let's compute that:\n\n3 +6=9\n\n9 +100004=100013\n\n100013 +100123=200136\n\n200136 +579=200715\n\n200715 +1245=201960\n\n201960 +790=202750.\n\nSo total sum is 202750. Number of windows is 7. So average is 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857..., which rounds to 28964.2857142857 as in the sample.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the plan for the code.\n\nRead n and k from input. Then read the list of a.\n\nCompute the initial sum of first k elements.\n\nInitialize total_sum as initial_sum.\n\nThen for each i in range(k, n):\n\n   current_sum -= a[i -k]\n\n   current_sum += a[i]\n\n   total_sum += current_sum\n\nAfter all iterations, compute average as total_sum / (n -k +1).\n\nPrint the average with six decimal digits.\n\nWait, but wait, what if n -k +1 is zero? No, because in the problem statement, k <=n, so n -k >=0, so n-k+1 is at least 1.\n\nSo no division by zero.\n\nNow, in Python, the code would look like:\n\nRead n, k from input line 1.\n\na = list of integers from input line 2.\n\nCompute initial_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n\ntotal = initial_sum\n\nfor i in range(k, len(a)):\n\n    total -= a[i -k]\n\n    total += a[i]\n\n    total_sum += total  # Wait, no. Wait, in the first iteration, i=k, which is the second day.\n\nWait, let's see. For i starting at k, which is the index of the (k+1)th element?\n\nNo, wait in Python, indices start at 0. So a has indexes 0 to n-1.\n\nFor example, in the first sample, a has 3 elements, 0,1,2.\n\ni runs from k=2 to n-1=2 (since len(a)=3). So i=2.\n\nIn the loop:\n\ncurrent_sum = initial_sum (sum of a[0:2], which is 3+4=7)\n\nthen, subtract a[i -k] = a[2-2]=a[0]=3 → current_sum becomes 4.\n\nAdd a[i]=a[2]=7 → current_sum becomes 11.\n\nAdd 11 to total → total becomes 7 +11 =18.\n\nSo yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code will be:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nif k ==0:\n\n    pass # but k is at least 1.\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\ntotal = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(k, n):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i -k] + a[i]\n\n    total += current_sum\n\naverage = total / (n -k +1)\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but wait, in the third sample, the output is given as 28964.2857142857, which is 202750 /7 = 28964.285714285714... So when printed with ten decimal places, it should be 28964.2857142857.\n\nBut when using string formatting in Python, the .10f format may round correctly.\n\nWait, let's see: 202750/7 = 28964.2857142857142857...\n\nSo when we format to 10 decimal places, the 10th digit is 7, but perhaps more digits are present beyond that. The output requires that the absolute or relative error is within 1e-6, so we just need to print enough digits.\n\nIn the sample, the output is '28964.2857142857' which is 10 decimal digits.\n\nWait, no, the sample shows 10 decimal digits: 9.0000000000, 10.0000000000, 28964.2857142857.\n\nWait, the third sample's output is 10 decimal digits, but in the note, it says the answer is considered correct if the error is within 1e-6. So perhaps in the code, we can format to, say, 10 decimal digits, and that would suffice.\n\nBut the problem statement says to output with at least six digits after decimal. So perhaps formatting to 10 is safe.\n\nWait, but looking at the sample outputs:\n\nFirst sample output is 9.0000000000, which is 10 decimals.\n\nSecond is 10.0000000000.\n\nThird is 28964.2857142857, which is also 10 decimals.\n\nSo perhaps the required output is exactly 10 decimal places, regardless of trailing zeros.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python.\n\nSo, in the code, after computing the average, we can format it to 10 decimal places, ensuring that even if the actual number has more than 10 digits, it's rounded properly.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: n =k. So only one window.\n\nFor example, n=2, k=2, a=[5,5]. So sum is 10, average is 10.0.\n\nOutput should be 10.0000000000.\n\nEdge Case 2: k=1, n=5.\n\nEach window is a single element. So sum each element and average is sum(a)/(5).\n\nWhich is straightforward.\n\nAnother Edge Case: when some a_i is 0, but that's handled correctly.\n\nWhat about when a contains large numbers, like 1e5, but the sum is manageable in Python's integers.\n\nI think the code handles all cases.\n\nWait, but wait, when k is larger than n? But according to the problem statement, k ≤n, so no.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nAnother thing to consider: when n=1, k=1. Then the average is a[0].\n\nThus, the code seems solid.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nThe code reads n, k, a.\n\nCompute initial_sum as sum of first k elements.\n\nLoop from k to n-1, updating current_sum and adding to total.\n\nCompute average.\n\nPrint with 10 decimal places.\n\nYes.\n\nSo now, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nTesting the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, k=2, a = [3,4,7]\n\ninitial_sum =3+4=7.\n\nThen for i=2:\n\ncurrent_sum =7 -3 +7=11.\n\ntotal becomes 7+11=18.\n\nAverage is 18/(3-2+1)=18/2=9.0 → output 9.0000000000.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=1, k=1, a=[10]\n\ninitial_sum=10.\n\ntotal is 10.\n\naverage is 10.0 → output 10.0000000000.\n\nSample 3:\n\nn=8, k=2.\n\nAs discussed earlier, total sum is 202750.\n\naverage =202750/7=28964.2857142857.\n\nSo output as 28964.2857142857.\n\nSo the code should correctly handle all these.\n\nNow, regarding the output format, in Python, the format string \"%.10f\" will round the number to 10 decimal places.\n\nWait, but what about when the 11th digit is 5 or more? It will round accordingly.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for the third sample, 202750 /7 is exactly 28964.2857142857142857..., so when formatted to 10 decimal places, it becomes 28964.2857142857.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
