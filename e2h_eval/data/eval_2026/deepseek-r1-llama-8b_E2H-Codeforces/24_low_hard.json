She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Luba is trying to close some tabs in her browser. Hmm, let me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo, the setup is that she has n tabs open, from 1 to n. The cursor starts at position pos. She needs to keep the tabs from l to r and close all others. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right, but only within the current available tabs. Or she can close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum number of seconds needed to achieve this.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. It seems like a state problem where each state is determined by the current position of the cursor and which tabs are still open. But considering that n can be up to 100, it's manageable, but perhaps there's a smarter way than brute-forcing all possibilities.\n\nWait, maybe I can break it down into steps. What needs to be done is:\n\n1. Move the cursor to a position where she can close the left tabs or the right tabs.\n2. Close those tabs.\n3. Then move to the other side (if needed) to close those tabs as well.\n4. Ensure that after closing, the remaining tabs are exactly l to r.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal approach is to decide whether to close the left first or the right first, and then calculate the steps for both cases, choosing the minimal one.\n\nBut wait, sometimes she might need to move between the two closing points, so the total steps would involve moving to the first point, closing, then moving to the second, closing, and possibly any additional movements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she can close both sides in one go if possible, but I don't think so because each closing action only affects one side.\n\nLet me consider the initial and target states.\n\nInitial state:\n- All tabs from 1 to n are open.\n- Cursor is at pos.\n\nTarget state:\n- Only tabs l to r are open.\n- So, all tabs outside l..r are closed.\n- The cursor can be anywhere within l..r, but probably it doesn't matter as long as the required tabs are closed.\n\nHmm, but the movement cost depends on where the cursor is and how far it needs to move.\n\nLet me think about what actions are possible each step.\n\nEach second, she can choose to:\n\nA. Move the cursor left: but only if there are tabs to the left (i.e., current pos > a, where a is the current leftmost open tab).\nB. Move the cursor right: same logic, pos < b.\nC. Close left: which means all tabs to the left of current cursor are closed. So after this, a becomes current pos.\nD. Close right: same, b becomes current pos.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when you close left, all tabs to the left of the current position are closed. So, the new a becomes the current position. Similarly, closing right sets the new b to the current position.\n\nSo, the process is that each close action changes a or b, which restricts future movement options.\n\nSo, the problem is similar to having a window [a, b] that starts as [1, n], and each close left or right operation reduces the window. We need to end up with [l, r].\n\nSo, the steps to get there could involve several close operations and movements.\n\nWait, but each close operation can only close one side at a time. So, perhaps the optimal way is to:\n\n- Move to a position where you can close the left tabs, then close them.\n- Then move to a position where you can close the right tabs, then close them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe close the right first, then the left.\n\nWe need to compute both possibilities and choose the minimal steps.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nCompute the minimal steps for both scenarios: closing left first, then right; or closing right first, then left.\n\nTake the minimal of the two.\n\nBut also, perhaps there's a case where one of the closes isn't needed. Like, if l == 1, then no need to close the left.\n\nSo, let's model this.\n\nFirst, determine which tabs need to be closed.\n\nIf l > 1, then we need to close all tabs to the left of l.\n\nSimilarly, if r < n, we need to close all tabs to the right of r.\n\nSo, we have two possible 'close' actions to perform: left_close (if l > 1) and right_close (if r < n).\n\nNow, for each possible order (left_close first, then right_close; or right_close first, then left_close), calculate the steps required.\n\nFor each such order, the steps are:\n\n1. Move from current position (pos) to the position where the first close will happen.\n\n2. Perform the first close.\n\n3. Then move from the new a (or b, depending on which was",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] while keeping the tabs within [l, r] open. Each second, Luba can either move the cursor left or right or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Necessary Closures**: Determine if tabs need to be closed on the left (if l > 1) and/or on the right (if r < n).\n2. **Calculate Movement Costs**: For each necessary closure, compute the minimal steps required to move the cursor to the optimal position for closing, perform the closure, and then move to the next required position.\n3. **Evaluate Both Orders**: Consider both possible orders of closures (left first then right, or right first then left) and choose the one with the minimal total steps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\ndef min_seconds(n, pos, l, r):\n    # Determine which closes are needed\n    close_left = l > 1\n    close_right = r < n\n\n    if not close_left and not close_right:\n        return 0\n\n    min_steps = float('inf')\n\n    # Order 1: Close left first, then right\n    steps_order1 = 0\n\n    if close_left:\n        # Move to position l\n        steps_order1 += abs(pos - l)\n        # Close left\n        steps_order1 += 1\n        # Now a is l\n        # Move to position r\n        steps_order1 += max(0, r - l)\n        # Close right\n        steps_order1 += 1\n    else:\n        # Move to position r\n        steps_order1 += abs(pos - r)\n        # Close right\n        steps_order1 += 1\n        # Move to position l\n        steps_order1 += max(0, r - l)\n        # Close left\n        steps_order1 += 1\n\n    # Order 2: Close right first, then left\n    steps_order2 = 0\n\n    if close_right:\n        # Move to position r\n        steps_order2 += abs(pos - r)\n        # Close right\n        steps_order2 += 1\n        # Now b is r\n        # Move to position l\n        steps_order2 += max(0, r - l)\n        # Close left\n        steps_order2 += 1\n    else:\n        # Move to position l\n        steps_order2 += abs(pos - l)\n        # Close left\n        steps_order2 += 1\n        # Move to position r\n        steps_order2 += max(0, r - l)\n        # Close right\n        steps_order2 += 1\n\n    current_min = min(steps_order1, steps_order2)\n    return current_min\n\nprint(min_seconds(n, pos, l, r))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Identify Closures**: Check if tabs need to be closed on the left (l > 1) and/or right (r < n).\n- **Movement Calculation**: For each order of closures, calculate the steps needed to move the cursor to the required positions, perform the closures, and then adjust the cursor position as needed.\n- **Optimal Path**: Evaluate both possible orders of closures and return the minimal steps required.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimal steps by considering both possible orders of operations, thus providing an optimal solution.",
