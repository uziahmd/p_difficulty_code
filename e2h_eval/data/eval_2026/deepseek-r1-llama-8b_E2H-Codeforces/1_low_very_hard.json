    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I calculate the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. Let's see what the problem says.\n\nThe plate is w rows by h columns. We have k rings to gild. Each ring is a border around an inner rectangle that's getting smaller each time. The first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, and so on. Each ring has a width of one cell.\n\nHmm, so for each ring i (starting from 1), the dimensions of the rectangle are (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h -4*(i-1)). Wait, because each ring reduces both the width and height by 4? Because for each ring, we're adding a border of 1 cell on each side, but since it's two sides, it's 2 cells each for width and height. So each ring effectively subtracts 2 from each dimension, but since each ring is built on top of the previous, maybe it's cumulative?\n\nWait, no. For the first ring, the rectangle is w x h. Then, the next ring would be (w-4) x (h-4), right? Because each ring adds a layer that takes away 2 from each side—so for each ring, the dimensions decrease by 4 each. So for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)).\n\nBut wait, when i=1, it's w x h, which makes sense for the outermost ring. So for each ring, the perimeter is calculated as 2*(width + height) -4. Because the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(w + h) -4 (since the corners are counted twice otherwise). So for each ring, the number of cells is 2*(current_w + current_h - 2).\n\nSo the plan is: for each ring from 1 to k, compute the current width and height, then compute the perimeter, and sum all these perimeters.\n\nLet me test this with the examples given.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1.\n\nThe first ring is 3x3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example: 7 9 1.\n\nPerimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*(14)=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2.\n\nFirst ring: 7x9 → perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28.\n\nSecond ring: 7-4=3, 9-4=5. So 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5-2)=2*6=12. Total 28+12=40. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Initialize total = 0\n- For i from 1 to k:\n   - current_w = w -4*(i-1)\n   - current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n   - if current_w <=0 or current_h <=0: break (but according to the constraints, k is such that this won't happen)\n   - perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n   - add to total\n- Output total\n\nWait, but what about when the rectangle becomes too small for a ring? Like, if after some i, current_w or current_h drops below 2, can't form a ring anymore. But the problem statement says that k is chosen such that it's valid. So in our code, we don't have to handle that case because the input will ensure that for k given, all rings can be formed.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\nCompute sum over i from 1 to k of 2*( (w -4*(i-1) + h -4*(i-1) ) - 2 )\n\nWhich simplifies to sum 2*(w + h - 4*(i-1)*2 - 2 ), but that might not matter.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead the input line, split into w, h, k.\n\nConvert them to integers.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n    current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: 3 3 1 → 8.\n\nSample 2:7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2)= 2*14",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is a border around an inner rectangle that gets smaller with each subsequent ring.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Understanding**: Each ring is a border around an inner rectangle. The first ring is along the edge of the plate, the second ring is two cells away from the edge, and so on. Each ring has a width of one cell.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the perimeter of the rectangle can be calculated using the formula \\(2 \\times (width + height - 2)\\). This formula accounts for the fact that the corners are counted twice in the sum of the sides.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the current dimensions of the rectangle, then calculate the perimeter and sum these perimeters to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: the number of rows (w), columns (h), and the number of rings (k).\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the current width and height of the rectangle. The width and height decrease by 4 for each subsequent ring because each ring adds a border of one cell on each side.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each ring, compute the perimeter using the formula \\(2 \\times (current\\_w + current\\_h - 2)\\) and add it to the total count of gilded cells.\n4. **Output the Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells after processing all rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal.",
