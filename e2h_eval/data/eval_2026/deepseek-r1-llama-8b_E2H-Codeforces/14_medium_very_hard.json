He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output all those n's in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n, because there are always more 2s than 5s. So each multiple of 5 contributes at least one 5, and multiples of higher powers contribute more.\n\nSo the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nThe problem is, given m, find all n such that the count of trailing zeros equals m. Then return how many such n's exist and list them.\n\nWait, but wait. How does the function behave? Let me think about it. The number of trailing zeros increases as n increases, but not strictly. It's a non-decreasing function. So for a given m, there might be a range of n's that all give exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nFor example, in the sample input, m=1. Looking at factorials:\n\n5! = 120 → 1 zero.\n6! = 720 → 1 zero.\n7! = 5040 → 1 zero.\n8! = 40320 → 1 zero.\n9! = 362880 → 1 zero.\n10! = 3628800 → 2 zeros.\n\nSo for m=1, n can be 5,6,7,8,9. That's five numbers.\n\nSo the task is to find all such n's that have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nNow, the challenge is to efficiently compute these n's given m. Because m can be up to 1e5, we need an efficient approach.\n\nI think the way to go is to find the smallest n with m trailing zeros, then find the largest, and then see if they form a consecutive sequence.\n\nWait, no. Because sometimes, adding 1 to n might not change the count, so the numbers could form a continuous range. For example, in the sample, n ranges from 5 to 9, which is a consecutive sequence of 5 numbers.\n\nSo, perhaps, the steps are:\n\n1. Find the lower bound (the first n where the trailing zeros equal m).\n2. Find the upper bound (the last n where the trailing zeros equal m).\n3. The count is upper - lower + 1, provided that the trailing zeros at lower is m, and the next number (lower+1) would either also have m or increase beyond m.\n\nBut how do we find the lower and upper bounds?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, the possible n's that yield m trailing zeros form a contiguous range. Because when you increment n by 1, the number of trailing zeros can stay the same or increase by 1. So for some m, there may be a range where adding 1 doesn't change the count until a multiple of 5 is hit.\n\nWait, let me think again. When n increases by 1, the number of trailing zeros increases by the number of times 5 divides into (n+1). For example, when n=4, n+1=5: adds 1 to the count. When n=24, n+1=25: adds 2 to the count. So when n increases, the trailing zeros can jump by more than one.\n\nSo, for a given m, there might be several n's that have exactly m trailing zeros, possibly forming a consecutive range.\n\nSo, the approach is to find the minimal n such that the number of trailing zeros is m, and then find how far this extends.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to find the minimal and maximal n that have exactly m trailing zeros, and then see how many n's are between them.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to perform a binary search for n where the trailing zeros count equals m. But since the function is non-decreasing, perhaps for each possible n, the count is m, and we need to find the leftmost and rightmost n's.\n\nWait, but that might not work directly because the function isn't strictly increasing. For example, multiple n's can have the same count.\n\nSo maybe the process is:\n\n- Find the smallest n where count(n) == m.\n- Find the largest n where count(n) == m.\n- The numbers between them inclusive are the valid n's.\n\nSo, how to find the smallest n with count(n) == m?\n\nWe can start by checking n=5, 10, etc., but that might be too slow. Alternatively, binary search.\n\nYes, binary search is efficient here. Because the count function is monotonically non-decreasing.\n\nWait, but wait: for a given m, the minimal n is the first n where count(n) >= m. Then, we need to check if it's exactly m.\n\nNo, that's not quite right. Because the count could jump over m. So, perhaps binary search can help us find the minimal n where count(n) is m.\n\nWait, but perhaps the minimal n is the smallest n such that count(n) is at least m, and then we need to check if it's exactly m.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's think. Suppose m is 5. Let's see what n's have count 5.\n\nCompute count(n):\n\nLet's see:\n\nn | count(n)\n...\n15: 3 (15/5=3, 15/25=0) → total 3\n20: 4 (20/5=4, 20/25=0) → 4\n25: 6 (25/5=5, 25/25=1 → 5+1=6)\nWait, perhaps for m=5, the count is 5 somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute count(n) for various n's.\n\nWait, let's try n=20: 20//5=4, 20//25=0 → total 4.\n\nn=24: 24//5=4, 24//25=0 → 4.\n\nn=25: 5 + 1 =6.\n\nSo, m=5: the count would be 5 for n=21,22,23,24?\n\nWait, let's compute count(21):\n\n21/5=4, 21/25=0 → 4.\n\ncount(22) same:4.\n\ncount(23):4.\n\ncount(24):4.\n\ncount(25):6.\n\nSo for m=5, the count is 4 for n=24, 6 for n=25.\n\nSo there is no n where count is 5? Or am I making a mistake.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, 25 has 6 trailing zeros. So for m=5, there is no n. So the output would be 0.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Because sometimes, the count could skip m, meaning that no n gives exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nSo in this case, for m=5, the answer is 0.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For a given m, find the minimal n where count(n) == m.\n\n   If no such n exists, output 0.\n\n   Otherwise, find the maximal n where count(n) == m.\n\n   The count of n's is (max_n - min_n +1).\n\nSo, how do we find min_n and max_n.\n\nHmm, perhaps for min_n, it's the first n where count(n) >= m, and then we check if count(n) is exactly m.\n\nWait, no. Because for m=5, the first n where count(n) is 5 would be none.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the lower bound and upper bound where count(n) is m.\n\nSo, let's think about the function f(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nf(n) is a non-decreasing function. So, for a given m, f(n) can be equal to m for a range of n's, or it can be that f(n) jumps from less than m to greater than m, meaning no n has exactly m zeros.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Find the minimal n where f(n) == m.\n\n- If such n doesn't exist, output 0.\n\n- Else, find the maximum n where f(n) == m.\n\nThen, collect all n's from min_n to max_n inclusive.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nBut how to find min_n and max_n?\n\nWell, to find min_n, we can perform a binary search on n, looking for the smallest n where f(n) == m.\n\nBut wait, binary search works for finding the first occurrence of m, but f(n) is non-decreasing, so perhaps the first occurrence of m is the minimal n.\n\nWait, but suppose f(n) is m for a range of n's. So, the minimal n is the first one in that range.\n\nSimilarly, the maximal n is the last one.\n\nSo, to find min_n, binary search for the smallest n where f(n) >= m, and then check if f(n) is exactly m. If yes, then it's the min. Else, no such n exists.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because f(n) could be exactly m for some n, but the binary search approach may not capture it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the lower and upper bounds via binary search.\n\nWait, here's another approach: for a given m, find the smallest n where f(n) >= m, and see if f(n) is m. Similarly, find the largest n where f(n) <= m, but that's not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is the minimal n where f(n) is m, and the maximal n is the maximal n where f(n) is m.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative approach: compute the lower bound by starting from 0 and incrementing until f(n) reaches m. Once found, set min_n as that n, then check if f(n) is m. Then, find the upper bound by incrementing until f(n) > m, then the max_n is the previous n.\n\nBut this is O(m), which for m up to 1e5 is manageable, but perhaps not optimal.\n\nWait, but for m=1e5, this could take up to 1e5 steps. Which is acceptable in Python, but perhaps a smarter way exists.\n\nAlternatively, binary search can help find the lower and upper bounds.\n\nWait, but binary search requires knowing a target condition. For the lower bound, perhaps find the first n where f(n) is m. But since f is non-decreasing, the first occurrence of m is the minimal n.\n\nWait, no. Because for example, if m=1, the first n is 5, but after that, 6,7,8,9 also have f(n)=1. So the minimal n is 5, and the maximal is 9.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal n can be found by solving f(n) = m, but for a binary search, perhaps we can find the minimal n where f(n) is m, and then find the maximal n where f(n) is m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the binary search, find the minimal n where f(n) >=m, and then check if f(n) is m. If it is, proceed. Else, no solution.\n\nSimilarly, find the maximal n where f(n) <=m, but that's tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps the better approach is to perform two binary searches: one to find the first n where f(n) >=m, and another to find the last n where f(n) <=m. Then, if the first n's f(n) is m, then the range is from that n to the last n where f(n) is m.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should outline the steps.\n\nStep 1: Implement a function count_trailing_zeros(n) that returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThat's straightforward. It's the sum of n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ... until the division is zero.\n\nStep 2: For a given m, find the minimal n where count_trailing_zeros(n) == m.\n\nHow? We can perform a binary search over n.\n\nWait, but binary search needs to know when to stop. Since the function is non-decreasing, the minimal n where f(n) == m could be anywhere between 0 and some upper limit.\n\nWait, but for m=0, the minimal n is 0, but in our problem, m starts from 1.\n\nSo, for m=1, the minimal n is 5.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n where f(n) ==m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the minimal n where f(n) >=m, and then check if f(n) is m. If it is, then we can proceed. Else, no solution.\n\nBut that's not sufficient because f(n) can be larger than m. For example, if m=5, and the first n where f(n)>=5 is 25, which has f(25)=6>5. So no solution exists.\n\nSo, the algorithm for finding min_n:\n\n- Use binary search to find the smallest n where f(n) >= m.\n\n- Check if f(n) is equal to m.\n\n- If yes, then min_n is n.\n\n- Else, no solution exists.\n\nSimilarly, for finding max_n, find the largest n where f(n) <=m, but that's not directly applicable. Wait, no. Because the max_n is the largest n where f(n) is exactly m.\n\nSo, to find the max_n, perhaps find the largest n where f(n) ==m.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: once we have the min_n, we can incrementally check until f(n) exceeds m. The last n where f(n) is m will be the max_n.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute min_n as the smallest n where f(n) >=m.\n\n   a. If f(min_n) !=m, then output 0.\n\n   b. Else, proceed.\n\n2. Compute max_n by starting from min_n and incrementing until f(n) >m.\n\n   a. The max_n is the last n before f(n) exceeds m.\n\nSo, code-wise:\n\nCompute min_n:\n\nlow = 0\n\nhigh = 5*m (since 5*m is an upper bound for n)\n\nwhile low < high:\n\n    mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n    current = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n\n    if current < m:\n\n        low = mid +1\n\n    else:\n\n        high = mid\n\nAfter loop, min_n is low.\n\nThen, check if count_trailing_zeros(min_n) ==m.\n\nIf not, output 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nThen, find the max_n:\n\nstart from min_n, and keep incrementing n until count_trailing_zeros(n) >m.\n\nSet max_n to n-1.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ncurrent = min_n\n\nmax_n = min_n\n\nwhile True:\n\n    current +=1\n\n    ctz = count_trailing_zeros(current)\n\n    if ctz >m:\n\n        break\n\n    max_n = current\n\nSo, the numbers from min_n to max_n inclusive are all the n's that have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nThus, the count is max_n - min_n +1.\n\nBut what if min_n is 0 and m=0? Well, according to the problem statement, m starts from 1, so that's not a concern.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, the issue is the efficiency of the count_trailing_zeros function. For large n, like up to 1e18, but since in the binary search step, the high is 5*m, and m is up to 1e5, 5*m is 5e5, so count_trailing_zeros(5e5) is manageable.\n\nWait, 5e5 is 500,000. So for each binary search step, which is up to log2(5e5) ~ 19 steps, each step calls count_trailing_zeros on mid, which is O(log n) time. So overall, for each test case, it's O(log n * log n) time.\n\nWhich is acceptable for Python.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: m=1.\n\nCompute min_n:\n\nbinary search between 0 and 5*1=5.\n\nlow=0, high=5.\n\nmid=2: f(2)=0 <1 → low=3.\n\nmid=(3+5)//2=4: f(4)=0 <1 → low=5.\n\nCheck f(5)=1 ==1 → min_n=5.\n\nThen, find max_n:\n\nstart at 5.\n\nincrement to 6: f(6)=1 → include.\n\n7:1.\n\n8:1.\n\n9:1.\n\n10:2>1 → break. So max_n is 9.\n\nSo, the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9 → count 5.\n\nSample Input 2: m=5.\n\nCompute min_n:\n\nbinary search between 0 and 25.\n\nWhat's f(20)=4, f(21)=4, f(24)=4, f(25)=6.\n\nSo during binary search, the low would be 20, high=25.\n\nmid=22: f(22)=4 <5 → low=23.\n\nmid=24: f(24)=4<5 → low=25.\n\nCheck f(25)=6>5 → no solution. So output 0.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nmin_n is 25.\n\nmax_n: 25 → f(25)=6.\n\n26:6.\n\n27:6.\n\n28:6.\n\n29:6.\n\n30:7 → break. So max_n=29.\n\nSo the numbers are 25,26,27,28,29 → 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code should correctly handle these.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nFirst, read m from input.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a string, perhaps. Wait, the problem says the input is a single integer m, but the sample shows ['1', '5'], so perhaps the input is read as a list of strings, each representing m.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the input is given as ['1', '5'], which suggests that the input is read as a list of strings. So, in code, perhaps read the entire line as a list, split by whitespace.\n\nIn Python:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count =0\n    while n>0:\n        n = n//5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    m_list = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(m_list[0])\n    # compute min_n\n    low =0\n    high =5*m\n    min_n = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high)//2\n        ctz = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if ctz < m:\n            low = mid +1\n        else:\n            high = mid -1\n    # After loop, low is the first n where f(n) >=m.\n    # Now check if f(low) ==m.\n    if count_trailing_zeros(low) !=m:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    # Now find max_n.\n    max_n = low\n    current = low\n    while True:\n        current +=1\n        ctz = count_trailing_zeros(current)\n        if ctz > m:\n            break\n        max_n = current\n    # Now, the numbers are from low to max_n, inclusive.\n    k = max_n - low +1\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(low, max_n+1))))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\nWait, wait, no. Because the initial binary search code is incorrect.\n\nWait, in the code above, the binary search is implemented as:\n\nlow=0, high=5*m.\n\nWhile low <= high:\n\n   mid = (low + high)//2\n\n   if ctz < m: → then set low=mid+1.\n\n   else: set high=mid-1.\n\nAfter the loop, low is the first n where f(n)>=m.\n\nWait, no. Let me test with m=1.\n\nInitial low=0, high=5.\n\nLoop:\n\nmid=2: f(2)=0<1 → low=3.\n\nmid=4: f(4)=0<1 → low=5.\n\nNow, mid= (5+5)//2=5.\n\nf(5)=1 >=1 → high=4.\n\nLoop ends.\n\nSo low is 5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=5.\n\nlow starts at 0, high=25.\n\nmid=12: f(12)=2 <5 → low=13.\n\nmid=19: f(19)=3 <5 → low=20.\n\nmid=22: f(22)=4 <5 → low=23.\n\nmid=24: f(24)=4 <5 → low=25.\n\nmid=24 is now mid= (23+25)//2=24.\n\nf(24)=4 <5 → low=25.\n\nmid= (25+25)//2=25.\n\nf(25)=6 >=5 → high=24.\n\nLoop ends, low=25.\n\nCheck f(25)=6 !=5 → output 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother test: m=6.\n\nlow=0, high=30.\n\nLet's see:\n\nmid=15: f(15)=3 <6 → low=16.\n\nmid=23: f(23)=4 <6 → low=24.\n\nmid=27: f(27)=6 → high=26.\n\nmid=25: f(25)=6 → high=24.\n\nmid= (24+26)//2=25.\n\nWait, perhaps I should simulate.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to just run through the code.\n\nIn any case, the code seems to correctly find the min_n and max_n.\n\nWait, but in the code, after the binary search, the variable low is set to the first n where f(n)>=m. Then, it checks if f(low) ==m. If not, output 0.\n\nOtherwise, it proceeds to find the max_n.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nInput: 1.\n\nmin_n=5.\n\nThen, find max_n:\n\ncurrent=5.\n\nIncrement to 6: f(6)=1.\n\nContinue until current=9: f(9)=1.\n\nIncrement to 10: f(10)=2>1 → break.\n\nmax_n=9.\n\nk=5.\n\nPrint 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: m=5.\n\nAs before, no solution.\n\nSo output 0.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nmin_n=25.\n\nmax_n=29.\n\nSo, output 5 numbers.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- m=0: but according to the problem statement, m is at least 1.\n\n- m= something very large, like 1e5.\n\nBut the code should handle it.\n\nAnother thing to consider: when the count_trailing_zeros function is called on a very large n, but in our binary search, n is bounded by 5*m, which for m=1e5 is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Additionally, we need to list all such integers in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{count} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until the division results in zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Minimum \\( n \\)**: We use binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the count of trailing zeros is at least \\( m \\). If the count at this \\( n \\) is exactly \\( m \\), it is our minimum \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Finding Maximum \\( n \\)**: Starting from the minimum \\( n \\), we incrementally check each subsequent integer until the count of trailing zeros exceeds \\( m \\). The last integer before this happens is our maximum \\( n \\).\n\n4. **Result Calculation**: The range of valid \\( n \\) values from the minimum to the maximum \\( n \\) inclusive gives the solution. If no such \\( n \\) exists, the result is 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(input[0])\n    \n    # Binary search to find the first n where count >= m\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    min_n = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        ctz = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if ctz < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    \n    # Check if the found low has exactly m trailing zeros\n    if count_trailing_zeros(low) != m:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Find the maximum n where count is exactly m\n    max_n = low\n    current = low\n    while True:\n        current += 1\n        ctz = count_trailing_zeros(current)\n        if ctz > m:\n            break\n        max_n = current\n    \n    k = max_n - low + 1\n    print(k)\n    if k > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(low, max_n + 1))))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line and split into a list of strings, converting the first element to an integer \\( m \\).\n- **Binary Search**: The binary search efficiently finds the smallest \\( n \\) where the count of trailing zeros is at least \\( m \\).\n- **Check Validity**: After finding the potential minimum \\( n \\), we verify if it indeed has exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros.\n- **Determine Maximum \\( n \\)**: Starting from the minimum \\( n \\), we incrementally check each subsequent integer until the count of trailing zeros exceeds \\( m \\), thus finding the maximum valid \\( n \\).\n- **Output**: The number of valid integers and the integers themselves are printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and correctly determine the range of integers \\( n \\) that produce exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros in their factorials.",
