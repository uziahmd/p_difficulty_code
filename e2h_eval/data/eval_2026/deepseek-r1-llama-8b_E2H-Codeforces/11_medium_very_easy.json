A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain resources: drink, lime slices, and salt. I need to calculate the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given the available resources.\n\nLet's break down the input variables:\n\n- n: number of friends\n- k: number of bottles of drink\n- l: milliliters per bottle\n- c: number of limes cut into slices\n- d: slices per lime, so total slices are c * d\n- p: grams of salt\n- nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast per friend\n- np: grams of salt needed per toast per friend\n\nEach toast for all friends requires each person to have their own set. So, for one toast, each friend needs nl ml, one slice, and np grams.\n\nSo, let's think about the total resources required for a certain number of toasts, say t toasts.\n\nTotal drink needed: n * t * nl (each of n friends takes nl ml per toast)\nTotal lime slices needed: n * t (each takes one slice per toast)\nTotal salt needed: n * t * np (each takes np grams per toast)\n\nNow, the resources we have are:\n\n- Total drink: k * l ml\n- Total lime slices: c * d\n- Total salt: p grams\n\nSo for t to be possible, all three conditions must be met:\n\n1. n * t * nl <= k * l\n2. n * t <= c * d\n3. n * t * np <= p\n\nWe need to find the maximum t such that all three are true.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Compute the maximum possible t based on each resource, then take the minimum of these.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the maximum t for each resource?\n\nFor drink:\n\nt_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nBecause each toast requires n * nl ml, and total drink is k*l.\n\nSimilarly, for lime slices:\n\nt_lime = (c * d) // n\n\nBecause each toast needs one slice per friend, so n slices per toast.\n\nWait no, wait: for t toasts, you need n * t slices because each of the n friends takes one per toast. So the maximum t based on lime is min((c*d) // (n), ...). Because (c*d) / n is the maximum number of toasts possible with the lime slices.\n\nThen, for salt:\n\nt_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nBecause each toast uses n * np grams of salt.\n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum of these three values: t_drink, t_lime, t_salt.\n\nOnce we have t, that's the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, let's see:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nCompute each:\n\nDrink: 4*5=20 ml. Each toast needs 3 * 3=9 ml? Wait, no. Wait, for each toast, each friend uses nl=3 ml. So for one toast, all 3 friends together use 3*3=9 ml. So total drink is 4*5=20.\n\nSo for t toasts, drink used is 3*t*3=9t? No, wait no: each toast, each friend uses nl, so for t toasts, each friend uses t * nl, total across all friends is n * t * nl.\n\nSo for drink, the maximum t is (k*l) / (n * nl). In the sample, (4*5)=20, n=3, nl=3. 20/(3*3) = 20/9=2.222, so floor is 2.\n\nLime: c*d=10*8=80. Each toast needs 3 slices. So 80 /3=26.666, floor 26.\n\nSalt: p=100, np=1. So 100/(3*1) =33.333, floor 33.\n\nSo the min is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nSo steps for the program:\n\n1. Read the input line as integers.\n\n2. Compute t_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\n3. Compute t_lime = (c * d) // n\n\n4. Compute t_salt = p // (n * np)\n\n5. The result is the minimum of these three t's.\n\nBut wait, what if any of the denominators are zero? No, since the input constraints say all numbers are positive integers. So no division by zero issues.\n\nSo in code, I can perform integer division using //.\n\nNow, how to read the input? The input is a single line with 8 integers.\n\nIn Python, I can read from stdin, split into list, then convert each to int.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute t_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nt_lime = (c * d) // n\n\nt_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n\nPrint result as a string.\n\nWait, but what if the result is zero? Like if any of the t's is zero, then the output is zero.\n\nYes, because min(0, ...) is zero.\n\nSo, in the sample input 3, the third test case is:\n\n10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\n\nCompute:\n\nt_drink = (1000 * 1000) // (10 * 50) = 1e6 / 500 = 2000\n\nt_lime = (25 *23) //10 = 575 //10 =57\n\nt_salt = 1// (10*1)=0.1, but integer division gives 0.\n\nSo min is 0, which is the output.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nCase where one of the resources is just enough.\n\nLike when all three t's are same.\n\nAnother case where one is zero, like in the third sample.\n\nAnother case where one of the t's is higher than others.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nSo now, write the Python code.\n\nRead the 8 integers, compute the three t's, find the minimum, print as string.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nI'll write it:\n\nRead the input:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute t_drink:\n\nt_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nt_lime = (c * d) // n\n\nt_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n\nprint(result)\n\nThat's it.\n\nSo the code is simple.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem Requirements**: Each friend needs a certain amount of drink, one lime slice, and a specific amount of salt per toast. We need to calculate the maximum number of such toasts each friend can make given the resources.\n2. **Calculate Resource Limits**:\n   - **Drink**: Total drink available is the product of the number of bottles and milliliters per bottle. The number of toasts possible based on drink is the total drink divided by the drink needed per toast per friend.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Total lime slices available is the product of the number of limes and slices per lime. The number of toasts possible based on lime slices is the total slices divided by the number of friends (each toast requires one slice per friend).\n   - **Salt**: Total salt available is given. The number of toasts possible based on salt is the total salt divided by the salt needed per toast per friend.\n3. **Determine the Limiting Resource**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the smallest value derived from the above calculations for each resource.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ndrink_toasts = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlime_toasts = (c * d) // n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\nprint(min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input values are read and parsed into respective variables.\n- **Calculating Toast Limits**:\n  - `drink_toasts` is calculated as `(k * l) // (n * nl)` which gives the maximum number of toasts possible based on the drink available.\n  - `lime_toasts` is calculated as `(c * d) // n` which gives the maximum number of toasts possible based on the lime slices available.\n  - `salt_toasts` is calculated as `p // (n * np)` which gives the maximum number of toasts possible based on the salt available.\n- **Finding the Minimum**: The result is the minimum of the three calculated toast limits, ensuring that all friends can toast the same number of times without any resource running out.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the maximum number of toasts each friend can make by considering each resource constraint and selecting the most restrictive one.",
