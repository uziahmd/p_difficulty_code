    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem correctly. The task is to find the maximum possible length of a substring that occurs two or more times in the input string. The occurrences can overlap. For example, in the sample input 'ababa', the substring 'aba' appears twice, overlapping each other. So the output is 3.\n\nLet me consider some examples. If the input is 'abcd', all substrings are unique, so the answer is 0. For 'zzz', the substrings 'zz' and 'zz' appear (overlapping), so the answer is 2.\n\nSo the goal is to find the maximum length L such that there exists a substring of length L that occurs at least twice in the string.\n\nHow do I approach this? One way is to check for all possible substring lengths starting from the largest possible down to 1, and for each length, check if any substring of that length appears more than once. Once I find the maximum L where this condition holds, that's my answer.\n\nThe steps could be:\n\n1. Iterate over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (length of string - 1) down to 1.\n2. For each length L, generate all possible substrings of length L.\n3. Check if any of these substrings appears more than once in the string.\n4. The first L for which this is true is our answer.\n\nWait, but the maximum possible L is len(s)-1 because a substring of length n-1 can't appear more than once since it would require the entire string except one character, but maybe for smaller strings, like length 2, it's possible.\n\nWait, no. For example, in 'aab', substrings of length 2 are 'aa' and 'ab'. 'aa' appears only once, but 'ab' appears once. So in that case, the answer is 0. But wait, maybe I'm not considering all possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible L from len(s)-1 down to 1, I check all possible substrings of that length and see if any repeat.\n\nBut what's the maximum L? It's the maximum possible length such that there exists two occurrences (possibly overlapping). So the maximum possible L is len(s)-1, but that's only possible if the entire string minus one character is present twice, which is impossible because the total length is len(s).\n\nWait, maybe the maximum possible L is len(s)-1. For example, in the string 'aaaaa', the substring 'aaaa' appears twice: positions 0-3 and 1-4. So the length is 4, which is len(s)-1.\n\nYes, so we need to check L from len(s)-1 down to 1.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop L from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\n   For each possible substring of length L, check if it appears more than once in the string.\n\n   If any such substring exists, return L as the answer.\n\nIf none found after checking all L down to 1, return 0.\n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently?\n\nThe naive approach is to generate all possible substrings of length L, store them in a set, and see if adding a new substring already exists in the set. If yes, then we have a duplicate.\n\nBut for each L, we can do this:\n\nFor current L, extract all substrings of length L, and check for duplicates.\n\nOnce any L is found where there's a duplicate substring, we can return it immediately, as we're checking from largest to smallest.\n\nSo the steps in code would be:\n\nRead the input string s.\n\nn = len(s)\n\nmax_length = 0\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    # collect all substrings of length L\n    substrs = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in substrs:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        substrs.add(substr)\n# if none found, return 0\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but wait: in the sample input 'ababa' (length 5), when L=3, the substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. So the first occurrence is added to substrs, then 'bab' is added. Then the next 'aba' is checked, which is already in substrs. So it returns 3, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'zzz' has length 3. So L starts at 2. Substrings are 'zz' (positions 0-1), then 'zz' (positions 1-2). So when i=0, substr is 'zz', add to set. Then i=1, substr is 'zz', which is already in the set. So returns 2.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcd' has L=3, substrings are 'abc', 'bcd'. Both unique, so no duplicates. Then L=2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'—all unique. L=1: 'a','b','c','d'—all unique. So returns 0.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nBut wait, what about the string 'abab'? Length is 4.\n\nCheck L=3: substrings 'aba' and 'bab'—no duplicates.\n\nL=2: substrings 'ab', 'ba', 'ab'. So when i=0: 'ab' added. i=1: 'ba' added. i=2: 'ab' is already present. So returns 2.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaa' — for L=2, substrings 'aa' and 'aa' → duplicates. So returns 2.\n\nNow, what about the time complexity? For each L from n-1 down to 1, for each possible substring of length L, we check if it's in a set. The set lookups are O(1), and for each L, the number of substrings is (n-L+1). So for each L, the work is O((n-L+1)*L) for extracting the substring, plus O(n-L+1) for checking in the set.\n\nWait, but extracting the substring takes O(L) per extraction. So for each L, it's O(n-L+1)*L + O(n-L+1). But L can be up to n-1. So for each L, the cost is O(n*L). So overall, the time is O(n^3), which for n=100 is manageable, since 100^3 is 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\nThus, the code is efficient enough for the constraints.\n\nSo the code outline is:\n\nRead the string.\n\nLoop L from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\n   create an empty set for substrings of length L.\n\n   for each starting index i from 0 to n-L:\n\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substr is in the set: return L.\n\n       else add it to the set.\n\nIf no such L found, return 0.\n\nYes, that's the plan.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nWait, but in Python, the 'range' function for the loop is important. For example, for n= len(s):\n\nWe want L to go from n-1 down to 1, inclusive.\n\nIn Python, range is exclusive on the upper bound. So to get L values from (n-1) down to 1:\n\nrange(n-1, 0, -1). Because the start is n-1, end is 0 (exclusive), step is -1.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, handling the code.\n\nRead the string from input. Since the input is given as a list in the example, but in the actual problem, the input is a single line, right?\n\nWait, looking back: the input is the first line contains the string. So in code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nThen process as above.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: Input is 'abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz' — but wait, the actual input is a single string. So in the code, the first line is read as s.\n\nWait, the sample input shows ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] but in reality, the input is just one string. So perhaps the sample is miswritten. Or perhaps it's a list of test cases. Wait, the problem says: \"the first input line contains the string\".\n\nSo in the code, we can assume that the input is a single string, not a list.\n\nSo for the sample input, the code would receive each string as a separate test case. So the code must read each string, process it, and output the result.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem statement says: \"You're given a string...\", so it's one string per run.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"The first input line contains the string.\" So for each run, the program reads one string.\n\nSo in the sample, the user may have presented multiple test cases, but in reality, the input is one string per run.\n\nWait, the sample shows three outputs, but that's probably because the user ran three test cases. So in the code, the input is read as a single string.\n\nSo the code should read one string, process it, and output the result.\n\nSo the code will be:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but in Python, 'exit()' can be done with 'sys.exit()', because otherwise, the program might not terminate properly. So perhaps we should import sys and call sys.exit().\n\nSo the code needs to include:\n\nimport sys\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            sys.exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs:\n\nTest case 1: s = 'abcd'\n\nLoop L from 3 down to 1.\n\nFor L=3: substrings are 'abc' and 'bcd' → no duplicates.\n\nL=2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' → no duplicates.\n\nL=1: 'a','b','c','d' → no duplicates.\n\nSo output 0.\n\nTest case 2: s='ababa' (length 5)\n\nCheck L=4: substrings 'abab', 'baba' → no duplicates.\n\nL=3: substrings 'aba' (i=0), 'bab' (i=1), 'aba' (i=2). When i=2, substr is 'aba', which is in seen. So return 3.\n\nTest case 3: s='zzz' → length 3.\n\nCheck L=2: substrings 'zz' (i=0), 'zz' (i=1). So when i=1, substr is 'zz' which is in seen. Return 2.\n\nThus, the code works for the samples.\n\nAnother test case: s='aaa'.\n\nCheck L=2: substrings 'aa' at i=0 and i=1. So return 2.\n\nAnother test case: s='abacab'.\n\nLooking for the longest substring that appears at least twice.\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe string is a b a c a b.\n\nPossible substrings of length 4:\n\nabac, bac a, acab → no duplicates.\n\nLength 3: aba, bac, aca, cab → aba appears at i=0 and i=3? Let's see:\n\nWait, s[0:3] is 'aba', s[3:6] is 'aca'—no. Wait, no, the string is 'a b a c a b'—indices 0-5.\n\nSubstrings of length 3:\n\ni=0: a b a → aba\n\ni=1: b a c → bac\n\ni=2: a c a → aca\n\ni=3: c a b → cab\n\nNo duplicates here.\n\nSubstrings of length 2:\n\nab, ba, ac, ca, ab → 'ab' appears at i=0 and i=4. So when L=2, during iteration:\n\ni=0: 'ab' added.\n\ni=1: 'ba' added.\n\ni=2: 'ac' added.\n\ni=3: 'ca' added.\n\ni=4: 'ab' is found, so return 2.\n\nSo the code returns 2.\n\nBut wait, is there a longer substring that appears twice?\n\nWait, 'aca' appears once.\n\nWhat about 'a' appears multiple times, but we are looking for the maximum length.\n\nSo the code correctly returns 2.\n\nAnother test case: s='abcdeabcde'.\n\nLooking for the longest possible substring.\n\nThe entire string is length 10. Substrings of length 9: 'bcdeabcde' and 'cdeabcde' → no duplicates.\n\nWait, no. Because the first substring is from 0 to 8, the second from 1 to 9. So different.\n\nBut for substrings of length 5: 'abcde' appears at i=0 and i=5. So when L=5, the code will find this and return 5.\n\nSo the code correctly returns 5.\n\nSo I think this approach is correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. These occurrences can overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to find the maximum length of a substring that appears at least twice in the string. The occurrences can be overlapping.\n2. **Intuition**: By checking substrings from the longest possible length down to 1, we can efficiently determine the longest valid substring. This approach ensures that we find the solution by checking each possible substring length in descending order.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a set to keep track of substrings of each length and check for duplicates. If a duplicate is found, we immediately return the current substring length as the result.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^3) in the worst case, which is efficient enough given the constraint that the string length does not exceed 100.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            sys.exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and its length is determined.\n2. **Loop Over Substring Lengths**: We loop from the longest possible substring length (n-1) down to 1.\n3. **Check Substrings**: For each length, generate all possible substrings and use a set to track seen substrings.\n4. **Duplicate Check**: If a substring is found in the set, it means this substring has appeared before, so we print the length and exit.\n5. **Result**: If no duplicate substrings are found for any length, we print 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest repeating substring by leveraging the properties of sets for quick lookups and ensuring we check from the largest possible substring downwards.",
