            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to convert a number from base a to base b, but with a twist. The third part of each door's lock has a number c in base a, and depending on whether the second part is R (meaning it's using the Roman numeral system) or another number, I have to write c in base b, either as a Roman numeral or as a regular integer.\n\nHmm, let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the input gives two integers a and b on the first line. Then, the next line is a string representing c in base a. But wait, the second part could be R, which means that for that case, the conversion is to Roman numerals in base b. Otherwise, it's a normal base conversion.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Read the input correctly. The first line is a and b, but b can be 'R'. If b is 'R', then when converting, we have to represent the number in Roman numerals instead of a standard base.\n\n2. Read the number c, which is given in base a. So, I'll need to parse this string into its integer value.\n\n3. Convert this integer into base b. But if b is 'R', then instead of converting to base 10 and then to Roman, I need to handle the conversion directly to Roman numerals based on base b.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that c is in base a, and we have to write it in base b. But if the second part of the door is R, meaning that the system uses Roman numerals, which might imply that b is in Roman? Or perhaps that the number is represented as a Roman numeral in base b.\n\nNo, the note says that when the second part is R, the output is the Roman numeral representation. So, regardless of what b is, if the second part is R, the number is converted to Roman numerals. Otherwise, it's converted to base b as a decimal string.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Parse a and b. If b is 'R', then the target is Roman numerals. Else, the target is base b.\n\n- Parse c as an integer in base a.\n\n- If the target is Roman numerals (b is 'R'), then convert the integer to Roman numerals according to the rules.\n\n- Else, convert the integer to base b, and output it without leading zeros.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the second part is either b or R. So the input line for c will be something like \"5 R\" meaning that the second part is R, so for that case, the number is treated as Roman numerals.\n\nWait, looking back at the example:\n\nIn the sample input, one of the cases is '16 R' which becomes 'V'.\n\nWait, the input lines are structured as:\n\nThe first line is a and b. The second line is the string for c, which is in base a.\n\nEach of these lines has four parts, but in the input, they are read as a single string. For example, the first sample input is ['10 2\\n1', ...]. So the first part is '10 2', which is a=10, b=2.\n\nThen, the second part is '1' which is c in base 10, so the output is '1' in base 2, which is '1'.\n\nAnother sample input is '16 R', which means that when converting, the number is written in Roman numerals. So, 16 in base 10 is 'XVI' in Roman numerals, but in the sample output it's 'V'—wait no, wait the sample input may have different a and b.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the sample inputs more carefully.\n\nWait, the sample input is given as:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nAnd the outputs are ['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A'].\n\nWait, let me parse each test case.\n\nFirst case: a=10, b=2. c is '1' in base 10. So convert 1 to base 2, which is '1' → output '1'.\n\nSecond case: a=16, b='R'. c is '5' in base 16. So the number is 5 in base 10. We need to convert it to Roman numerals. 5 is 'V', so output 'V'.\n\nThird case: a=5, b='R'. c is '4' in base 5. So 4 in base 10 is IV in Roman numerals. Output 'IV'.\n\nFourth case: a=2, b=2. c is '1111001' in base ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from base `a` to either base `b` or to Roman numerals if specified. The problem involves reading the input, parsing the numbers, and converting them according to the given rules.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: Read the integers `a` and `b`, where `b` can be 'R' indicating Roman numerals. Read the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Parsing the Number**: Convert the string `c` from base `a` to an integer.\n3. **Conversion**:\n   - If `b` is 'R', convert the integer to Roman numerals using the rules for Roman numeral representation.\n   - Otherwise, convert the integer to base `b` as a string without leading zeros.\n4. **Output**: Print the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef int_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while n >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            n -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    a = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    b = input[idx]\n    idx +=1\n    c_str = input[idx]\n    # Parse c\n    c = 0\n    for ch in c_str:\n        c = c * a + int(ch)\n    # Determine target\n    if b == 'R':\n        print(int_to_roman(c))\n    else:\n        # Convert to base b\n        num = 0\n        s = []\n        while c > 0:\n            remainder = c % b\n            if remainder < 10:\n                s.append(str(remainder))\n            else:\n                s.append(chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n            c = c // b\n        if not s:\n            print('0')\n        else:\n            print(''.join(reversed(s)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into components. The first two values are `a` and `b`, and the next value is the string representation of the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Parsing the Number**: The number `c` is parsed from base `a` to an integer by iterating through each character and converting it to its integer value.\n3. **Conversion to Roman Numerals**: If `b` is 'R', the integer is converted to a Roman numeral using a lookup table that maps values to their corresponding Roman symbols.\n4. **Conversion to Base `b`**: If `b` is not 'R', the integer is converted to base `b` by repeatedly dividing by `b` and collecting remainders. These remainders are then reversed to form the final string representation.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed, ensuring no leading zeros when converting to a base.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both conversions and ensures correct handling of edge cases such as leading zeros and large numbers within the constraints.",
