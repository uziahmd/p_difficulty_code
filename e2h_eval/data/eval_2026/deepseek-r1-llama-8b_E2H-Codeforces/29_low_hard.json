Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about processing a string of digits through a series of substitution queries and then computing the resulting number modulo 1e9+7. Hmm, right.\n\nSo, Andrew starts with a string s. Then there are n queries. Each query is in the format \"di->ti\", which means replace every occurrence of di in the string with ti. The substitutions are applied in order, each one transforming the current state of the string.\n\nWait, but substitution can be tricky because each substitution affects the subsequent ones. For example, if a substitution replaces '2' with '00', and another substitution replaces '0' with '5', the order matters. So the first substitution happens, then the second applies to the new string.\n\nBut handling all these substitutions directly by modifying the string each time might not be efficient, especially since the string can be up to 105 characters long, and there are up to 105 queries. But wait, the constraints say that the sum of the lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. So maybe a brute-force approach is manageable here.\n\nWait, but what's the alternative? Because each substitution can change the string, and the next substitution depends on the current string.\n\nHmm, perhaps the way to model this is to represent the string as a set of transformations. Because each substitution is a rule that applies to certain digits, but the rules can be applied in a particular order.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can pre-process the substitutions into a function that, given a digit d, returns the string that represents its replacement after all applicable substitutions.\n\nWait, that sounds promising. Because each substitution is a replacement for a specific digit, and if a substitution for a digit is done later, it could override or modify the earlier substitutions.\n\nWait no, because the substitutions are applied in order. So, for example, if the first substitution is \"2→a\", and the second is \"a→b\", then when processing the first substitution, any '2's become 'a's, and then the second substitution will process 'a's as 'b's. So the overall effect is that '2's become 'b's.\n\nBut if the substitutions are in reverse order, that wouldn't happen.\n\nSo, the order of substitutions matters. Therefore, each substitution must be processed in the given order, and each substitution affects the current string.\n\nSo, the straightforward approach is to process each substitution in sequence, and for each, replace all occurrences of di in the current string with ti.\n\nBut how do I represent the string efficiently, especially considering that substitutions can make the string longer, which could affect future substitutions?\n\nHmm, but the maximum length of the string is manageable. Because each substitution can add some characters, but the total sum of ti lengths is 105, which is acceptable.\n\nWait, let's think about it. Initially, the string is up to 105 characters. Each substitution replaces a single character with a string of length k. So the total possible length after all substitutions is 105 * (max substitution factor). But since the sum of all ti lengths is 105, the worst case is that each substitution replaces a single character with 105, leading to 105*105=11025, which is manageable.\n\nSo processing each substitution step by step is feasible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read the initial string s.\n\n2. For each query in order:\n   a. Split the query into di and ti.\n   b. Replace every occurrence of di in the current string with ti.\n   c. So, for example, if the current string is '123123', and the query is '2→00', then the string becomes '10031003'.\n\n3. After all queries, compute the numeric value of the resulting string modulo 1e9+7. But note that the string can be very long, even after substitutions. So computing the mod is tricky because the number could be huge.\n\nWait, how to compute the mod when the string can be up to 10^4 or more characters? Because converting it to an integer directly would cause overflow issues.\n\nSo, the key is to compute the mod without building the entire number. We can process each character in the string sequentially, updating a running mod value.\n\nFor example, for each character c in the final string:\ncurrent_mod = (current_mod * 10 + int(c)) % MOD\n\nThis way, even for very long strings, we can compute the mod efficiently.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Process each substitution query, updating the string.\n- Once all queries are done, compute the mod of the resulting string.\n\nNow, how to implement the substitution?\n\nEach substitution is replacing all instances of di with ti. So for each query, we need to scan the current string and replace each occurrence of di with ti.\n\nBut doing this naively for each query could be O(n * m), where m is the length of the string at each step. Since n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a string of digits through a series of substitution queries and then compute the resulting number modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). Each substitution query replaces all occurrences of a specific digit with a given string. The challenge is to efficiently handle these substitutions and compute the result without causing overflow issues.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Read Input**: Start by reading the initial string and the list of substitution queries.\n2. **Process Substitutions**: For each substitution query, replace every occurrence of the specified digit in the current string with the given substring. This must be done in the order the queries are provided.\n3. **Compute Modulo**: After processing all queries, compute the numeric value of the resulting string modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). To avoid overflow, process each character of the resulting string sequentially, updating the modulo value as you go.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\nqueries = []\ncurrent_s = s\nfor _ in range(n):\n    parts = input().split('->')\n    di = parts[0]\n    ti = parts[1]\n    # Replace di in current_s with ti\n    temp = []\n    for c in current_s:\n        if c == di:\n            temp.append(ti)\n        else:\n            temp.append(c)\n    current_s = ''.join(temp)\n\n# Compute mod\nresult = 0\nfor c in current_s:\n    result = (result * 10 + int(c)) % MOD\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading Input**: The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from the input. Each query is processed to extract the digit `di` to be replaced and the substring `ti`.\n2. **Processing Queries**: For each query, iterate over each character in the current string. If the character matches `di`, append the substring `ti`; otherwise, keep the original character. This updates the string with the new substitutions.\n3. **Modulo Calculation**: After all substitutions, the resulting string is converted to a number. To handle large numbers, each character is processed sequentially, updating the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). This avoids overflow and ensures efficient computation.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the substitutions and computes the required modulo value, ensuring correctness and performance even for the maximum constraints.",
