There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on a street with certain restrictions and maximizing profit. Each house has a height, and the profit is the sum of squares of these heights. But there are some restrictions from the city that limit the maximum height in specific ranges.\n\nHmm, the input gives n spots, each can have a height between 0 and h. Then m restrictions: each restriction says that in the range l_i to r_i, the tallest house must be at most x_i. So for each such restriction, every spot in l_i to r_i must have a height <=x_i, but wait no— because the tallest in that range must be <=x_i. Oh right, so that means all spots in that range can't exceed x_i. Because if any spot was higher than x_i, then the tallest would be higher. So each spot in l_i to r_i must have height at most x_i.\n\nSo the constraints are: for each spot i, its height a_i must satisfy all the restrictions that include it. Also, each a_i can't exceed h, and can't be negative, but since they are houses, maybe zero is allowed.\n\nWait, the problem statement says the height can be between 0 and h, inclusive. So the maximum possible for a spot is min(h, x_i) for all applicable restrictions. Wait, no: for a spot that's covered by multiple restrictions, the height must be <= the minimum of all the x_i's that apply to it. Because each restriction imposes that in their ranges, the tallest is at most x_i, so the spot must be <=x_i for each such restriction.\n\nSo for example, if a spot is covered by two restrictions with x=3 and x=2, then the spot's height must be <=2.\n\nSo the approach is: for each spot, determine the maximum allowed height based on all the restrictions that include it. Then, choose each spot's height as high as possible (to maximize profit) without exceeding that maximum allowed height.\n\nBut how do we model this? It seems like each spot's maximum allowed height is the minimum of all x_i's from the restrictions that cover it, and also not exceeding h.\n\nWait, no. For a spot i, let's find all the restrictions that include i (i.e., l_j <=i <=r_j). For each such j, the a_i must be <=x_j. So the maximum possible a_i is the minimum of all x_j's where j covers i. And since the maximum allowed is h, it's the minimum of x_j's and h. Wait, because even if some x_j's are higher than h, but a_i can't exceed h anyway. So the effective maximum for a_i is the minimum of all x_j's for j covering i, but if that minimum is less than h, then that's the cap. Otherwise, it's h.\n\nWait, but what if the minimum is higher than h? Then the maximum allowed is h, because a_i can't be higher than h anyway. So the maximum allowed for a_i is the minimum of (min_x_i, h), where min_x_i is the minimal x_j across all restrictions that include i.\n\nWait, no. Because for each restriction that includes i, a_i must be <=x_j. So the maximum a_i can be is the smallest x_j among all such j. Because if, say, one restriction says x=3 and another says x=5 for the same i, then a_i can't be more than 3.\n\nBut wait, if a_i is 3, then both restrictions are satisfied because 3<=3 and 3<=5. So yes, the maximum is the minimum x_j for the i's applicable restrictions.\n\nSo for each spot i, compute the minimum x_j among all restrictions that include i. Let's call this value max_allowed_i. Then, a_i can be at most the minimum between max_allowed_i and h. Wait, no, because if the min x_j is already <=h, then a_i's maximum is that min x_j. Otherwise, it's h.\n\nWait, for example: suppose i is covered by a restriction x=5, and h is 10. Then the max allowed is 5. But if i is covered by a restriction x=15, and h is 10, then the max allowed is min(15, 10) =10. Because the restriction is x=15, which is higher than h, so a_i can't be more than h.\n\nWait, no. Because the restriction says the tallest in that range must be <=x_j. If x_j is higher than h, then a_i can be up to h. Because the condition is automatically satisfied. So for a spot i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of x_j's across all applicable restrictions, but if that minimum is larger than h, then it's capped at h.\n\nWait, no. Let's think again.\n\nSuppose for spot i, there are two restrictions:\n\nRestriction 1: l=1, r=5, x=10\nRestriction 2: l=3, r=7, x=8\n\nSo for spot i=4, the applicable x_j's are 10 and 8. So the maximum allowed is min(10,8) =8. So a_4 can be up to 8.\n\nBut if there's another restriction for i=4 with x=12, then the min x_j is still 8, because 8 is smaller than 12. So a_i is 8.\n\nBut if none of the restrictions apply to i=4, then the maximum allowed is h.\n\nSo for each spot i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of all x_j's for restrictions that include i, or h if that minimum is greater than h.\n\nWait, no. Suppose for i=4, the restrictions are [x=15], and h=10. Then the min x_j is 15, which is bigger than h. So the maximum allowed is min(15, h) =10. Because the restriction requires that in that range, the tallest is <=15. Since h=10 is <=15, the a_i can be up to 10.\n\nSo the correct way to compute the maximum allowed height for a spot is the minimum between h and the minimum x_j over all applicable restrictions.\n\nNo, wait. Because if a spot is covered by restrictions with x_j's 5, 10, 15, the min is 5. So a_i can be at most 5, regardless of h.\n\nBut if a spot is only covered by a restriction with x_j=20, and h=15, then the maximum allowed is 15.\n\nSo the formula is: for each spot i, collect all x_j's from restrictions that include i. Compute the min_x_i as the minimum of those x_j's. The maximum allowed for a_i is min(min_x_i, h).\n\nWait, no. Because for the case where min_x_i is 20 and h is 15: the a_i can be up to 15, because the restriction is satisfied because 15 <=20. So yes, it's the min between min_x_i and h.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each spot i (from 1 to n), determine all the restrictions that include i (l_j <=i <= r_j).\n2. For each i, collect all x_j from those restrictions.\n3. Compute min_x_i as the minimum of x_j's for i. If there are no restrictions for i, min_x_i is h (since the only constraint is the global h).\n4. Then, the maximum allowed for a_i is min(min_x_i, h). Wait, wait: if min_x_i is 20 and h is 10, then min(20,10) is 10, which is correct. But if min_x_i is 5 and h is 10, then a_i can be 5.\n\nWait, no, wait: when min_x_i is 5, a_i can be at most 5, because all restrictions require a_i <=5. So the maximum allowed is 5, regardless of h. So in that case, the maximum is min(min_x_i, h) is correct.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n- For each spot, find all the restrictions that include it. For each such restriction, take x_j and find the minimum among them.\n\nThen, the maximum allowed for the spot is the minimum of that min_x and h.\n\nOnce we have the maximum allowed for each spot, the optimal is to set a_i to that maximum, because that will maximize the sum of squares.\n\nBecause the square function is increasing, the higher a_i is, the better the profit.\n\nSo the solution is:\n\nCompute for each spot i, the maximum allowed height as described, then sum the squares.\n\nSo, the steps for coding are:\n\n- Read n, h, m.\n\n- Read m restrictions. For each, store l, r, x.\n\n- For each spot i from 1 to n:\n\n   - Collect all x where the restriction's l <=i <= r.\n\n   - Compute min_x_i as the min of these x's. If no such x exists, min_x_i is h.\n\n   - Then, max_a_i = min(min_x_i, h)\n\n- Sum the squares of each max_a_i.\n\nWait, but wait: if a spot i is covered by multiple restrictions, the maximum allowed is the minimum of all x's for those restrictions. Because any higher would violate some restriction.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nIn Python:\n\nWe can represent the restrictions as a list of tuples. Then, for each i in 1..n:\n\n   collect all x where l <=i <= r.\n\n   if any x, then min_x = min(x_list)\n\n   else, min_x = h.\n\n   max_a_i = min(min_x, h)\n\nWait, but no: if the spot is not covered by any restriction, then it's only limited by h. So yes, min_x is h.\n\nWait, for example, if a spot is not covered by any restriction, then the maximum allowed is h, because there are no restrictions to limit it further.\n\nSo, code-wise:\n\nfor each i in 1..n:\n\n   min_x = h  # default, if no restrictions apply\n\n   for each restriction in restrictions:\n\n       l, r, x = restriction\n\n       if l <= i <= r:\n\n           if x < min_x:\n\n               min_x = x\n\n   max_a_i = min(min_x, h)\n\nsum += (max_a_i)^2\n\nWait, but wait: suppose a spot is covered by a restriction x=5, and another x=10. Then the min_x is 5, which is less than h. So a_i is 5.\n\nBut if a spot is covered by x=20 and h=10, then min_x is 20, but a_i can be 10.\n\nYes, so the code correctly captures that.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the code above, for each restriction that applies, x could be higher or lower than the current min_x. So, for each such x, we compare and take the min.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for example, if a spot i is covered by two restrictions: x=5 and x=10.\n\nSo, for i, the min_x is min(5,10) =5.\n\nBut if the code starts with min_x = h (say h=10), then for each x in the restrictions, it compares x to min_x and takes the smaller. So first, min_x is 10. Then, x=5 is less than 10, so min_x becomes 5. Then, x=10 is compared, but 5 is smaller, so no change. So min_x is 5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo yes, the code is correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nTest case 1 from the problem:\n\nInput:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nSo for spot 1: covered by restriction 1 (x=1). So min_x is 1. So a_i is 1.\n\nSpot 2: covered by restriction 2 (x=3). So a_i is 3.\n\nSpot3: covered by restriction3 (x=2). So a_i is 2.\n\nSum: 1+9+4=14. Correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nFor spot 1: no restrictions. So min_x is 10. So a_i is 10.\n\nSpot2: covered by restriction1 (x=8). So a_i=8.\n\nSpot3: covered by both restrictions. x=8 and x=7. So min_x is 7.\n\nSpot4: covered by restriction2 (x=7). So a_i=7.\n\nSo heights are 10,8,7,7. Sum is 100 +64+49+49=262. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, h=5, m=0. So no restrictions. So a_i=5. Profit is 25.\n\nWhat if n=1, h=5, m=1, l=1, r=1, x=3. So a_i can be 3. Profit 9.\n\nAnother case: n=2, h=10, m=2. Restriction1: l=1, r=1, x=5. Restriction2: l=2, r=2, x=7.\n\nSpot1: x=5 → a=5.\n\nSpot2: x=7 → a=7.\n\nSum is 25+49=74.\n\nAnother case: spot 2 is covered by two restrictions. Like, one x=5, another x=6. So min_x is 5.\n\nThus, a_i=5.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nSo, now, the plan is to:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nRead m lines, each as l, r, x.\n\nFor each i from 1 to n:\n\n   min_x = h\n\n   for each restriction in the list:\n\n       if l <=i <=r:\n\n           if x < min_x:\n\n               min_x = x\n\n   max_a_i = min(min_x, h)\n\nsum all max_a_i squared.\n\nOutput the sum.\n\nNow, code.\n\nIn Python, read from stdin.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a string, perhaps, but in the problem statement, the input is shown as a list of strings. So in code, perhaps read via standard input.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m.\n\nEach of the next m lines contains three integers l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nrestrictions = []\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    restrictions.append( (l, r, x) )\n\ntotal =0\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    min_x = h\n\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n\n        if l <=i <=r:\n\n            if x < min_x:\n\n                min_x = x\n\n    max_a = min( min_x, h )\n\n    total += max_a **2\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but wait. What if a spot i is covered by multiple restrictions, including overlapping ones. For example, in the second sample, spot3 is covered by two restrictions (the first is 2-3, x=8, the second is 3-4, x=7). So for i=3, the x's are 8 and7. So min_x is 7.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=1:\n\nCheck each restriction.\n\nOnly the first one: l=1<=1<=1=r=1. x=1.\n\nSo min_x is 1.\n\nmax_a=1.\n\ni=2:\n\nOnly the second restriction: l=2<=2<=2. x=3.\n\nmin_x=3.\n\nmax_a=3.\n\ni=3:\n\nThird restriction: l=3<=3<=3. x=2.\n\nmin_x=2.\n\nmax_a=2.\n\nSum 1+9+4=14.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\ni=1: no restrictions. min_x=10.\n\ni=2: restriction1, x=8.\n\ni=3: restriction1 (x=8), restriction2 (x=7). min_x is7.\n\ni=4: restriction2, x=7.\n\nHeights:10,8,7,7. Sum 100+64+49+49=262.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, h=5, m=0. So output is 25.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, h=10, m=2:\n\nRestriction1: 1 1 5.\n\nRestriction2: 2 2 7.\n\ni=1: x=5.\n\ni=2: x=7.\n\nSum 25+49=74.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, h=10, m=3:\n\nRestriction1: 1 2 5.\n\nRestriction2: 1 2 6.\n\nRestriction3: 1 2 7.\n\nThen for i=1 and 2, min_x is min(5,6,7)=5.\n\nSo a_i is 5 for both. Sum 25+25=50.\n\nWait, no: for i=1, all three restrictions apply. x values 5,6,7. Min is5. So a_i is5.\n\nSame for i=2.\n\nSo sum is 25+25=50.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, the code needs to read from stdin, process, and output the sum.\n\nMake sure that the output is printed as an integer, which the code does.\n\nSo I think this should pass all test cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit possible from building houses on a street with given constraints. Each house has a height that contributes to the profit based on the square of its height, but there are restrictions on the maximum height allowed in specific ranges.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Restrictions**: Each restriction specifies a range and a maximum height. The tallest house in each specified range must not exceed this maximum height. This means that for each spot within the range, the height must be at most the minimum of all applicable restrictions' maximum heights.\n2. **Determine Maximum Allowed Height for Each Spot**: For each spot, calculate the minimum height allowed by all applicable restrictions. If no restrictions apply, the maximum height is the global maximum height provided (h).\n3. **Calculate Profit**: For each spot, use the determined maximum allowed height to compute the profit contribution. Sum these contributions to get the total profit.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nrestrictions = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    min_x = h\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n        if l <= i <= r:\n            if x < min_x:\n                min_x = x\n    max_a = min(min_x, h)\n    total += max_a ** 2\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of spots (n), the maximum allowed height (h), and the number of restrictions (m). Each restriction is stored as a tuple in a list.\n2. **Processing Each Spot**: For each spot from 1 to n, determine the minimum height allowed by all applicable restrictions. This is done by iterating over each restriction and checking if the spot falls within the restriction's range.\n3. **Compute Maximum Height**: The maximum allowed height for each spot is the minimum of the restriction values or the global maximum height (h), whichever is smaller.\n4. **Summing Profits**: The profit from each spot is calculated as the square of its maximum allowed height and summed up to get the total profit.\n\nThis approach ensures that all restrictions are respected while maximizing the profit from building the tallest possible houses within those constraints.",
