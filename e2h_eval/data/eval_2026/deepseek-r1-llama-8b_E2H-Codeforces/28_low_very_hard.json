String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to count the number of beautiful strings based on some given conditions. Hmm, let me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nThe string is beautiful if it consists only of 0s and 1s, with exactly n 0s and m 1s. Also, we can modify the string by replacing two last characters with one, which depends on what they are. For example, two 0s become a 0, two 1s become a 0? Wait no, wait the problem says: when you replace two last characters, if they are two zeros, replace them with a single 0. If they're two ones, replace with a single 0 as well? Or is it that if both are 0, replace with 0; if both are 1, replace with 1? Wait, the description says: \"this character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\" Wait, no, that's not right. Let me re-read that part.\n\nOh, no, the operation is: replace two last characters with exactly one other character. This character is 1 if it replaces two zeros, otherwise 0. So, if the two last characters are both 0, the result is 1. If they are both 1, the result is 0. If they are different, then perhaps the operation isn't allowed? Or does it just take one of them? Wait, the problem says the modification is done on a string of length at least two. So during each modification, you look at the last two characters. They must be the same, because otherwise, how do you decide what to replace them with?\n\nWait, the problem statement says that in a modification, you replace two last characters with one. The character is 1 if it's replacing two zeros, else 0. So regardless of whether the two are 0 or 1, you look at what they were, and set the new character accordingly. So, for example:\n\n- If the last two are '00', replace with '0' (wait, no, the problem says it becomes 1. Because replacing two zeros with 1.\nWait, no: the problem says, \"the character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\" So when you replace two zeros, you get a 1. Otherwise, if you replace two ones, you get a 0. So for example:\n\n- Two 0s → replaced by 1\n- Two 1s → replaced by 0\n\nAh, okay, that makes sense now.\n\nNow, the task is to find the number of beautiful strings s such that after any number of modifications (possibly zero), the resulting string has exactly g as its last character.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that the modified string can be obtained from s via some modifications, but the original string s is the beautiful one. Oh wait, no. The problem says that the string is beautiful if it satisfies the criteria regarding the counts of 0s and 1s. But also, when you perform modifications on s, the resulting string's last character must be g. Or wait, no, maybe the modification steps are applied, and then the final string must consist of exactly n' 0s and m' 1s, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly zero) number of modifications.\" So, for a string to be beautiful, it must satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. It consists of exactly n 0s and m 1s.\n2. After applying some number of modifications (possibly zero), the resulting string's last character is g.\n\nBut wait, each modification reduces the length of the string by one. So starting from a string of length n + m, each modification reduces it by 1. So the number of modifications possible is (n+m - k), where k is the final length. But the final length can vary depending on how many modifications are made.\n\nHmm, but the key point is that the process of modifying the string affects the last character, and we want the final string's last character to be g.\n\nSo, the approach is to model all possible ways to reach a string that ends with g, considering all possible sequences of modifications.\n\nBut this seems tricky. How can I model this efficiently, especially since n and m can be up to 105, which suggests that a dynamic programming approach is needed.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of the possible states of the string after each modification. Each state can be represented by the current length of the string and the last character. Because each modification reduces the length by 1, and the last character changes based on the previous two.\n\nWait, but the string's entire content isn't tracked beyond the last character. Because each modification depends only on the last two characters. So, perhaps the state can be represented by",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that can be transformed into a string ending with a specific character (g) after a series of allowed modifications. The beautiful strings must have exactly n zeros and m ones, and each modification reduces the length of the string by one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - A beautiful string consists of exactly n zeros and m ones.\n   - Modifications can only be performed on strings of length at least two. Each modification replaces the last two characters with one character based on their values:\n     - Replacing two zeros results in a '1'.\n     - Replacing two ones results in a '0'.\n   - We need to determine how many such beautiful strings can be modified (possibly zero times) to end with the character g.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:\n   - Use dynamic programming (DP) to keep track of the number of ways to end up with a string of a specific length and ending with a specific character.\n   - Define `dp[i][c]` as the number of ways to modify a string of length i such that it ends with character c (0 or 1).\n\n3. **State Transitions**:\n   - For each length from 2 to (n + m), update the DP table based on the previous state and the possible modifications:\n     - If the previous two characters were both '0', replace them with '1' and update the current state.\n     - If the previous two characters were both '1', replace them with '0' and update the current state.\n     - If the previous two characters are different, no valid modification is possible, so no transition occurs.\n\n4. **Base Cases**:\n   - Initialize the DP table for strings of length 1 with the counts of zeros and ones.\n\n5. **Result Calculation**:\n   - Sum the valid ways to end up with a string of any possible length that ends with g, considering all possible initial configurations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nn, m, g = map(int, input().split())\n\nmax_len = n + m\ndp = [[0] * 2 for _ in range(max_len + 1)]\n\n# Base case: strings of length 1\nif n >= 1:\n    dp[1][0] += 1\nif m >= 1:\n    dp[1][1] += 1\n\nfor length in range(2, max_len + 1):\n    for c in [0, 1]:\n        # Check possible previous states\n        if length >= 2:\n            prev_length = length - 1\n            for prev_c in [0, 1]:\n                if prev_length >= 1:\n                    # Case 1: previous two were '00'\n                    if prev_c == 0:\n                        if prev_c == prev_c and c == 1:\n                            dp[length][c] += dp[prev_length][prev_c]\n                            dp[length][c] %= MOD\n                    # Case 2: previous two were '11'\n                    if prev_c == 1:\n                        if prev_c == prev_c and c == 0:\n                            dp[length][c] += dp[prev_length][prev_c]\n                            dp[length][c] %= MOD\n                    # Case 3: previous two were different, no change\n                    if prev_c != prev_c:\n                        pass  # no transition\n            # Also, consider adding a new character without modifying\n            # Wait, no, because each step is a modification, which reduces the length\n            # So, the initial state is the base case, and each step is a modification\n            # So, for each length, we process transitions from length-1\n\n        # Also, for each current length, check if it's possible to add a new character without modifying\n        # Wait, no. Because each modification reduces the length, so we start from longer lengths and go down.\n\n# After filling dp, the answer is the sum over all possible lengths of dp[length][g], but only if the total 0s and 1s match n and m.\n# Wait, no. Because the initial string has exactly n 0s and m 1s. When you perform modifications, the count of 0s and 1s changes as follows:\n# Each modification replaces two same characters with one, so the total count reduces by 1 each time.\n\n# So, for a final string of length k, the initial string must have been modified (k - (n + m)) times.\n\n# But wait, the initial string has n + m characters. Each modification reduces the length by 1, so after t modifications, the length is (n + m) - t.\n\n# The key point is that the final string must have exactly (n + m - t) characters, and the counts of 0s and 1s must be adjusted based on the modifications.\n\n# But this complicates things because the counts are not fixed anymore. So perhaps the approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The problem states that the string s is beautiful if it consists of exactly n 0s and m 1s. Then, after some modifications, the resulting string must end with g. However, each modification changes the counts of 0s and 1s. So the final string may not have exactly n and m anymore. Therefore, my initial approach was wrong because it didn't account for the change in counts due to modifications.\n\nSo, this complicates the problem. The initial approach considered only the last character, but the counts of 0s and 1s change with each modification. So, the problem isn't just about the last character but also about maintaining the correct counts after each modification.\n\nThis makes the problem more complex. Let me rethink the approach.\n\nEach modification reduces the length by 1 and changes the counts based on the two characters replaced:\n\n- If two 0s are replaced by a 1: the count of 0s decreases by 2, and the count of 1s increases by 1.\n- If two 1s are replaced by a 0: the count of 1s decreases by 2, and the count of 0s increases by 1.\n- If two different characters are replaced, the modification isn't possible, as per the problem statement?\n\nWait, no. The problem says that during a modification, you replace the last two characters. If they are the same, you replace them with 1 or 0 as per the rules. If they are different, what happens? The problem statement doesn't specify, but the example shows that modifications can be done even when the last two are different. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the first sample, \"01\" is a beautiful string. Applying one modification: since the last two are '1' and '0', which are different. What happens? According to the problem statement, the modification replaces two last characters with one. Since the two are different, the character becomes 0 if replacing two ones, else 1. Wait, the problem says: \"the character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\" So, if the two last characters are different, you can't perform a modification because the condition for replacement isn't met. Or perhaps you can't perform the modification if the two last characters are different.\n\nWait, re-reading the problem statement: \"a modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\"\n\nAh, so the operation is possible regardless of whether the two last characters are the same or different. But the result depends on whether they were both zeros or both ones.\n\nWait, no: the operation is defined as replacing the last two characters with a single character based on their values. So, if the last two are different, the modification isn't possible because the problem statement says \"two last characters from the string\". Or does it mean that the operation is always possible, but the resulting character is determined by the rule regardless of whether they're the same or not? That seems unlikely.\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\" So, if the last two are different, the operation replaces them with one if they are zeros, else zero. Wait, but that would mean that if they are different, then it's not two zeros nor two ones, so the replacement character is zero. But that doesn't make sense because if the last two are different, you can't have two zeros or two ones.\n\nSo perhaps the modification can only be done when the last two characters are the same. Otherwise, the modification isn't possible, and thus the string cannot be modified further.\n\nThis is an important point. So, during each modification step, we can only perform the operation if the last two characters are the same. Otherwise, no modification is possible.\n\nTherefore, the state in our DP should include not only the current length and the last character but also the counts of 0s and 1s. This makes the problem more complex, as the state space grows significantly.\n\nGiven the constraints (n and m up to 105), a straightforward DP approach may not be feasible due to high computational complexity. However, considering that the counts of 0s and 1s can be up to 105 each, and the maximum length is 210, we can model the state as (length, last_char, zeros, ones). But even this could be too slow.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that each modification affects the counts of 0s and 1s in a predictable way:\n- Replacing two 0s with a 1 reduces the 0 count by 2 and increases the 1 count by 1.\n- Replacing two 1s with a 0 reduces the 1 count by 2 and increases the 0 count by 1.\n\nThus, the counts of 0s and 1s change as follows:\n- If the last two are 0s, then after modification, the 0 count decreases by 2, and the 1 count increases by 1.\n- If the last two are 1s, then after modification, the 1 count decreases by 2, and the 0 count increases by 1.\n\nTherefore, the DP state can be represented as (length, last_char, zeros, ones), where:\n- length is the current length of the string.\n- last_char is the last character (0 or 1).\n- zeros and ones are the current counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nThe transitions would be:\n- For each state (l, c, z, o), if the next two characters (which would be the last two before the modification) are both c, then:\n  - If c is 0, after modification, the new last character is 1, and the new counts are z-2, o+1.\n  - If c is 1, after modification, the new last character is 0, and the new counts are z+1, o-2.\n  - Update the new state (l-1, new_c, new_z, new_o) accordingly.\n  \nAdditionally, since each modification reduces the length by 1, the maximum length decreases by 1 each step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nn, m, g = map(int, input().split())\n\nmax_len = n + m\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\n# We'll use a dictionary for DP states to save space\ndp = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int)))\n\n# Initialize the base case: strings of length 1\nif n >= 1:\n    dp[1][0] = 1\nif m >= 1:\n    dp[1][1] = 1\n\nfor length in range(2, max_len + 1):\n    for last_char in [0, 1]:\n        current_zeros = 0\n        current_ones = 0\n        for zeros in range(n + 1):\n            for ones in range(m + 1):\n                count = dp[length - 1][last_char][zeros][ones]\n                if count == 0:\n                    continue\n                # Check if we can modify the last two characters\n                if length >= 2:\n                    # Previous state was of length-1, last_char_prev, and counts\n                    # To perform a modification, the last two characters must be the same\n                    # So, the previous state's last character must be equal to last_char\n                    # Because the current state's last character is last_char, which is the result of the modification\n                    # Wait, no. The current state's last character is the result of the modification, which depends on the previous two\n                    # So, for the previous state, the last two characters were the same, and the modification was applied\n                    # So, the previous state's last character must be the same as the current state's last character?\n                    # No, because the current last character is the result of the modification. For example, if the previous last two were 0, the new last is 1.\n                    # So, to get to the current state, the previous state must have had last_char as 0, allowing modification to 1.\n                    # Similarly, if current last_char is 0, the previous must have been 1.\n                    # So, the previous state's last character must be the opposite of the current.\n                    # Wait, let me think: the current state's last character is c, which resulted from a modification of two same characters.\n                    # So, the previous state's last two were both c_prev, and after modification, the last character became c.\n                    # So, if c is 0, the previous state's last two were both 1.\n                    # If c is 1, the previous state's last two were both 0.\n                    # Therefore, for a transition from length-1 to length, the previous state's last character must be 1 - c.\n                    # So, in the DP, for each state (length, c), the previous state must be (length-1, 1 - c)\n                    # And in that previous state, the counts must allow for the modification.\n                    # So, for the transition to be valid, the previous state must have had enough 0s or 1s to perform the modification.\n                    # For example, to transition from (length-1, 1) to (length, 0), the previous state must have had at least two 1s.\n                    # Or, to transition from (length-1, 0) to (length, 1), the previous state must have had at least two 0s.\n                    # So, for each possible previous state, check if the counts allow the modification.\n                    # The previous state is (length-1, prev_last_char), where prev_last_char = 1 - c\n                    # The counts in the previous state must satisfy:\n                    # if prev_last_char is 0: previous_ones >= 2\n                    # if prev_last_char is 1: previous_zeros >= 2\n                    # Because to perform a modification, we need two same characters.\n                    # So, for each possible previous state, check if the counts allow the modification.\n                    # Then, compute the new counts after the modification.\n                    # Finally, update the current state's counts.\n                    prev_last_char = 1 - c\n                    # Check if the previous state exists and has the necessary counts\n                    if (length - 1, prev_last_char, zeros - new_z, ones - new_o) in dp:\n                        # Compute the new counts after modification\n                        if prev_last_char == 0:\n                            # Replacing two 0s with 1\n                            if zeros >= 2:\n                                new_z_prev = zeros - 2\n                                new_o_prev = ones + 1\n                                # The new state is (length, c=1)\n                                if c == 1:\n                                    dp[length][c][new_z_prev][new_o_prev] += count\n                                    dp[length][c][new_z_prev][new_o_prev] %= MOD\n                        elif prev_last_char == 1:\n                            # Replacing two 1s with 0\n                            if ones >= 2:\n                                new_z_prev = zeros + 1\n                                new_o_prev = ones - 2\n                                if c == 0:\n                                    dp[length][c][new_z_prev][new_o_prev] += count\n                                    dp[length][c][new_z_prev][new_o_prev] %= MOD\n\n# Now, sum all the states where the string ends with g and the counts are compatible\nresult = 0\nfor length in range(1, max_len + 1):\n    for zeros in range(n + 1):\n        for ones in range(m + 1):\n            if (length, g, zeros, ones) in dp:\n                result += dp[length][g][zeros][ones]\n                result %= MOD\n\nprint(result % MOD)\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution uses dynamic programming to track the number of ways to form strings of different lengths, ending with specific characters, while maintaining the counts of 0s and 1s.
