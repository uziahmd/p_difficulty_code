Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Vasily wants to maximize the number of hours his candles can burn. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each candle burns for one hour and then goes out. But when you have b burned-out candles, you can make a new one. So the idea is to keep track of the leftover candles after burning them and use those to create new ones, which in turn can be burned again.\n\nLet me break it down. Suppose we start with 'a' candles. Each time we burn them, they become 'b' used candles. But wait, no, each candle gives one used candle. So if I have x candles, after burning, I get x used candles. Then, I can convert some of these into new candles.\n\nWait, the process is: each candle gives 1 used candle. So after burning all initial candles, I have a used candles. Then, I can exchange every b used candles for a new one. So the first step is to compute how many new candles I can make from the initial a.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input, a=4 and b=2. After burning, you have 4 used candles. Since each new candle requires 2 used, you can make 4//2 = 2 new candles. Burn them, adding 2 to the total hours (so 4+2=6), and now you have 2 used candles again. Make another 1 new candle (since 2 >=2), burn it, add 1 more hour (total 7). Now you have 1 used candle, which is less than 2, so you can't make any more. So total is 7.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Start with the initial a candles.\n2. Add a to the total hours.\n3. Calculate the remaining used candles: rem = a % b. Because after making as many as possible from a, the remainder is rem.\n4. While rem >= b:\n   a. Make new_candles = rem // b\n   b. Add new_candles to the total hours.\n   c. The new rem is (rem % b) + new_candles. Because after using rem to make new_candles, the leftover is rem % b. Plus, the new_candles are now used, adding to the rem.\n\nWait, let me clarify. When you have rem used candles, you can make new_candles = rem // b. Each new candle is burned, which takes 1 hour. So for each new_candles, you add new_candles to the total. Also, each new candle, when burned, adds 1 to the used candles. So after burning new_candles, you have rem % b (the leftovers) plus new_candles (from the newly made ones).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- total = a\n- rem = a % b\n- while rem >= b:\n   new = rem // b\n   total += new\n   rem = (rem % b) + new\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nLet's test this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample: a=4, b=2.\n\ntotal =4\n\nrem =0 (since 4%2=0). So loop doesn't run. Wait wait, no. Because after burning 4 candles, you have 4 used. So rem is 4, not 4%2. Oh right, because 4 divided by 2 is 2 new candles, but 4 mod 2 is 0.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it differently. Maybe the initial rem is a, not a mod b. Because the initial a is all used after burning. So let's see:\n\nIn the first sample, a=4, b=2.\n\ntotal =4\n\nrem =4\n\nloop runs since 4 >=2:\n\nnew =4//2=2\n\ntotal becomes 4+2=6\n\nrem becomes (4%2=0) + 2 = 2.\n\nNext iteration: rem=2 >=2.\n\nnew=1\n\ntotal=7\n\nrem=(2%2=0) +1=1 <2. Loop ends.\n\nTotal is 7. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal=6\n\nrem=6.\n\n6 >=3: new=2, total=8. rem=6%3=0 +2=2 <3.\n\nSo total is 8. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5.\n\nAfter burning, rem=5.\n\nLoop: new=1, total=6. rem=5%5=0 +1=1 <5. So total is 6.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=3.\n\nInitial rem=10.\n\n10//3=3, rem=10%3=1 +3=4.\n\ntotal becomes 13.\n\nNow rem=4 >=3:\n\n4//3=1, rem=1 +1=2 <3.\n\ntotal becomes 14.\n\nNo more loops.\n\nSo total is 14.\n\nLet me calculate manually:\n\nBurn 10: 10h, 10 used.\n\nMake 3 new from 10: 3h, 3 used. Total 13.\n\nUsed now: 10 -3*3=1? Wait, no. Wait, when you make 3 new candles from 10, each new candle uses 3 used. So 10//3=3, and 3*3=9 used, leaving 1.\n\nThen, after burning the 3 new, you have 3 used added. So rem is 1 +3 =4.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the algorithm seems solid.\n\nSo now, in code:\n\nWe read a and b.\n\nCompute the initial total as a.\n\nrem = a\n\nloop while rem >=b:\n\n   new = rem //b\n\n   total += new\n\n   rem = rem % b + new\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, handling the input.\n\nIn Python, we can read the input as a single line, split into two integers.\n\nSo, something like:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute as per the above.\n\nPrint the total.\n\nBut wait, what if b is 1? But according to the problem statement, b is at least 2. So no issue.\n\nSo code:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nrem = a\nwhile rem >= b:\n    new = rem // b\n    total += new\n    rem = rem % b + new\nprint(total)\n\nYes, that should do it.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: 4 2 → 7.\n\nSample 2: 6 3 →8.\n\nAnother test case: a=2, b=2.\n\nTotal starts as 2.\n\nrem is 2 >=2: new=1, total 3. rem becomes 0 +1=1 → loop ends.\n\nSo output is 3.\n\nAnother test: a=3, b=2.\n\nInitial rem=3.\n\nnew=1, total=4. rem=3%2=1 +1=2.\n\nLoop again: new=1, total=5. rem=2%2=0 +1=1 → loop ends.\n\nSo 5.\n\nWhich is correct: 3 →1 new, 1 new → total 5.\n\nYes.\n\nI think this covers all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has. Each candle burns for one hour and then becomes a used candle. Used candles can be recycled to create new candles, which can then be burned again.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles `a`. Each candle burns for one hour, so we initially add `a` hours to our total.\n2. **Recycle Process**: After burning all initial candles, we have `a` used candles. We can convert every `b` used candles into a new candle. This process continues until we no longer have enough used candles to make a new one.\n3. **Loop Until Exhaustion**: In each iteration of the loop, calculate how many new candles can be made from the current number of used candles. Add the number of new candles to the total hours. Update the count of used candles to reflect the leftovers after making new candles and the newly burned ones.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nrem = a\nwhile rem >= b:\n    new = rem // b\n    total += new\n    rem = rem % b + new\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `a` (initial number of candles) and `b` (number of used candles needed to make a new one).\n- **Initial Total Hours**: The initial total hours are set to `a` because each candle burns for one hour.\n- **Recycling Used Candles**: Using a loop, we repeatedly convert used candles into new ones until we can no longer make a new candle. In each iteration, calculate the number of new candles that can be made, add their burn time to the total, and update the count of used candles.\n- **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when the number of used candles is less than `b`, meaning no more new candles can be made.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the maximum hours by continuously recycling used candles, ensuring optimal use of resources.",
