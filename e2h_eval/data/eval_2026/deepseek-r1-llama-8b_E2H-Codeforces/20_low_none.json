For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of ways to choose integers c_s for all binary strings s of lengths from 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. The answer needs to be modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm, let me understand what a beautiful multiset is. A multiset is beautiful if for every string s (from length 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as their prefix doesn't exceed c_s. So for each s, we have a constraint that the count of its prefixes in the multiset is ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased, we're choosing c_s for each s, and then the beautiful multiset is determined based on these c_s's. But the problem isn't about building the multiset; it's about counting the number of possible c assignments where the maximum possible size of such a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nSo, the task is: find the number of assignments of c_s's such that when you construct the maximum possible beautiful multiset based on these c_s's, its size is exactly f.\n\nI think I need to model this as some kind of combinatorial problem where each c_s contributes to the constraints on the counts of certain strings.\n\nLet me break down the problem. For each binary string s, which is a prefix of some longer strings, the c_s determines how many of those longer strings can be included in the multiset without violating the constraints.\n\nBut wait, the beautiful multiset is built by selecting as many strings as possible without exceeding any c_s. So for each s, the number of times s appears as a prefix in the multiset must be ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the multiset consists of binary strings of length exactly n. So the beautiful multiset is a collection of such strings. For each string s of any length (from 1 to n), the number of elements in the multiset that are extensions of s (i.e., s is a prefix of them) must not exceed c_s.\n\nSo, for example, if s is \"0\", then any string that starts with \"0\" (like \"00\", \"01\", etc.) would contribute to the count for s. So, the count for s is the number of strings in the multiset that are prefixed by s.\n\nNow, the goal is to compute the number of ways to assign c_s's such that the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps there's a way to model it with dynamic programming or inclusion-exclusion.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the constraints. Each string s has a constraint that the number of its extensions in the multiset is ≤ c_s. The maximum possible size of the multiset is f, which is determined by these constraints.\n\nWait, but the maximum possible size is f. So for the assignment of c_s's, the maximum possible size under those constraints is exactly f.\n\nHow can we model this? Maybe using generating functions or inclusion-exclusion principles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a tree. Each node represents a binary string, and the children are the strings formed by adding 0 or 1. Then, the constraints on the c_s's form a system that must be satisfied.\n\nBut considering that n is up to 15, the total number of nodes (binary strings of lengths 1 to n) is 2 + 4 + ... + 2^15 = 2*(2^15 - 1) = 32766, which is manageable for some DP approach.\n\nWait, but 32766 is manageable, but for k and f up to 2e5, that might be a problem if we try to track all possible values.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a tree, and for each node s, the count of its children in the multiset (plus one for s itself if it's present) can't exceed c_s. Hmm, but s being present as a string of length n may affect multiple c_s's.\n\nWait, no. Because for s of length m, any extension (of length m+1) would be a child in the tree. So the count for s is the number of its descendants in the multiset plus whether s is present in the multiset?\n\nWait, no. Because the multiset contains strings of length exactly n. So, for s of length m < n, the count of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is equal to the number of such strings in the multiset that are longer than m and start with s. Additionally, if s is itself of length m == n, then the count is just the number of times s appears in the multiset.\n\nSo, for each s of length m, the count is the sum over all t where",
