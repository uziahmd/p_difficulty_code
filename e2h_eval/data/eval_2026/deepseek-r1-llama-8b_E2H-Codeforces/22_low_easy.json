After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the number of successful students in a group. A student is considered successful if there's at least one subject where they are the best. Being the best means that no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\nHmm, so for each subject, I need to determine which student has the maximum mark. Then, for each student, check if they are the maximum in any subject.\n\nLet me think about the steps I need to take.\n\nFirst, I'll read the input. The input starts with two integers n and m. Then there are n lines, each representing a student's grades for m subjects. Each line is a string of m characters, each being a digit from 1 to 9.\n\nFor each subject (from 0 to m-1), I need to find the maximum mark among all students. Then, for each student, I'll see if they have the maximum in any of their subjects.\n\nWait, no. For each subject, only one student can be the best if there are multiple maxes? Or wait, if multiple students have the same maximum, then none of them is the best in that subject. Because the problem says, \"no student got a higher mark\". So if two students have 5 in a subject, then neither is the best because the other has the same. So for a subject, the best is unique: it's the student(s) with the highest mark, but if there are multiple, then there is no best.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the definition says a student is the best in a subject if there's NO student who got a higher mark. So if two students have the same maximum, then for that subject, neither is the best. Because the other student doesn't have a higher mark, just equal.\n\nSo for example, in a subject, if the marks are [5,5,3], then no student is the best in that subject. Because both 5s are not better than each other.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first student has 5, second also 5. So for the first, does any student have a higher mark? No. So according to the definition, the first student would be considered the best for that subject. Wait, no, wait: the condition is that for a student to be the best in a subject, there must be no student with a higher mark. So if another student has the same mark, then the first student is still the best because no one has a higher mark.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\n\"A student is the best at some subject if there exists no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\"\n\nSo, for a subject, the best student is the one with the highest mark. If multiple students have the same highest mark, then all of them are best in that subject.\n\nBecause, for any of them, there's no student with a higher mark. So all of them are considered best.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. So for a subject, if the maximum mark occurs in k different students, then each of those k students is the best in that subject.\n\nSo for each subject, I need to collect all the students who have the maximum mark in that subject. Then, for each student, if they are in any of these sets for any subject, they are considered successful.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each subject (each column in the gradebook), find the maximum mark.\n2. Collect all students (their indices) who have that maximum mark in that subject.\n3. For each student, check if they are present in any of these subject's best lists.\n4. Count how many such students exist.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string of m characters. Convert each character to an integer. So for each student, we have a list of m integers.\n\nThen, for each subject j (from 0 to m-1):\n\n   Find the maximum value in that column.\n\n   Collect all students (indices i) whose j-th mark is equal to the maximum.\n\nStore this information.\n\nFinally, for each student, check if they are in any of the subject's best lists.\n\nCount the number of students who are in at least one best list.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nLet's think about the data structures.\n\nWe can represent the students as a list of lists, where each sublist is the marks for a student.\n\nThen, for each subject j:\n\n   max_mark = max of the j-th element across all students.\n\n   best_students = list of indices i where students[i][j] == max_mark.\n\nStore this for each j.\n\nThen, for each student i, check if i is in any of the best_students lists.\n\nIf yes, count i as successful.\n\nSo now, let's think about the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students `n` and the number of subjects `m`.\n2. **Data Storage**: Store each student's marks in a list of lists where each sublist represents a student's marks across all subjects.\n3. **Subject Analysis**: For each subject, determine the maximum mark and identify all students who achieved this maximum mark.\n4. **Student Success Check**: For each student, check if they are among the top performers in any subject. If they are, count them as successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nbest_in_subject = []\n\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_mark = max(students[i][j] for i in range(n))\n    best = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] == max_mark:\n            best.append(i)\n    best_in_subject.append(best)\n\ncount = 0\nsuccessful = set()\nfor i in range(n):\n    if i in successful:\n        continue\n    for j in range(m):\n        if i in best_in_subject[j]:\n            count += 1\n            successful.add(i)\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input is read to get the number of students `n` and subjects `m`. Each subsequent line represents a student's marks across all subjects.\n2. **Storing Marks**: Each student's marks are stored in a list of lists for easy access.\n3. **Finding Top Performers**: For each subject, we find the maximum mark and identify which students achieved this mark. This information is stored in a list of lists where each sublist contains the indices of students who are the best in that subject.\n4. **Counting Successful Students**: We iterate over each student and check if they are among the top performers in any subject. If they are, they are counted as successful.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the number of successful students by leveraging list operations and comprehensions for clarity and performance.",
