Chess rook moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.  To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an $$$N \\times N$$$ board. Each cell of the board has a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$N ^ 2$$$ in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number $$$1$$$. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules:   Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number. If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of $$$1$$$ vun. If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped. Egor should find an $$$N \\times N$$$ board on which the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such $$$N \\times N$$$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains one integer $$$N$$$  — the size of the board, $$$1\\le N \\le 500$$$.\n\n## Output\nThe output should contain $$$N$$$ lines.In $$$i$$$-th line output $$$N$$$ numbers  — numbers on the $$$i$$$-th row of the board. All numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$N \\times N$$$ must be used exactly once.On your board rook must pay strictly less vuns than the queen.If there are no solutions, print $$$-1$$$.If there are several solutions, you can output any of them. \n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '4']\n\n### Output\n['-1', '4 3 6 12 \\n7 5 9 15 \\n14 1 11 10 \\n13 8 16 2']\n\n## Note\nIn case we have $$$1 \\times 1$$$ board, both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.In second sample rook goes through cells $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 5 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 2 \\to 8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14$$$. Queen goes through $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$$$.As a result rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to create an N x N chessboard with numbers 1 to N² such that the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen when following their movement rules. If it's not possible, I have to output -1.\n\nHmm, let me read the problem again carefully.\n\nThe process is: each move, the piece (either rook or queen) moves to the cell with the minimal number among all reachable and unvisited cells. The rook moves like a rook—any straight line, any number of squares, but stops at the first cell in the direction. The queen can move any number of squares vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.\n\nEach time the queen makes a step that requires teleporting (because all adjacent cells are already visited), she pays a fee of 1 vun. For the rook, each such teleport also costs 1 vun.\n\nWait no, wait. Let me see:\n\nThe rules for both pieces are similar. For each move:\n\n- Among all unvisited cells reachable in one move by the piece, choose the one with the smallest number.\n- If there are no such cells, then if there are unvisited cells, teleport to the smallest-numbered one. This counts as a teleport, costing 1 vun.\n- If all cells are visited, stop.\n\nSo, for each teleport step (when all adjacent reachable cells are visited but there are still unvisited ones), the piece pays a fee.\n\nThe goal is to arrange the board such that the total number of teleport steps (and thus vuns paid) by the rook is strictly less than that by the queen.\n\nSo, how can we model this?\n\nI think the key is to find a way to arrange the numbers such that the rook's path has fewer teleport steps than the queen's.\n\nWait, but both paths start at 1. So, the initial position is 1. Then, each step is determined by the next minimal number in the reachable cells.\n\nFor the rook, each step can only move along straight lines (same row, column, or diagonal). But it's allowed to move any number of squares in any direction, but will stop at the first cell in that direction that's unvisited and has the smallest number.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the rook's movement is: from the current cell, look in all four directions (up, down, left, right) for the nearest cell that's unvisited and has the smallest possible number. So, the rook's next move is the minimal cell in the set of all reachable cells, which includes all cells in the same row, column, and diagonals.\n\nSimilarly for the queen, which can reach any cell in the same row, column, or diagonal, so the next cell is the minimal in that entire set.\n\nWait, but the queen's movement is more flexible because she can reach any cell in those lines, regardless of distance. So for the queen, the next cell is the minimal in the entire row, column, or diagonal, except those already visited.\n\nBut for the rook, since it can only move in straight lines, the next cell is the minimal in the same row, same column, or same diagonal as the current position.\n\nWait, no. Because the rook's movement allows it to move any number of squares, but it must stop at the first unvisited cell in some direction that has the minimal number.\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly. Let's think: When moving, the rook can choose any direction, but for each direction, it can only move to the first unvisited cell in that direction. Then, among all possible such cells in all directions, it picks the one with the minimal number.\n\nWait, that's probably the case.\n\nSo, for example, if the current cell is (x,y), the rook looks in all four directions (left, right, up, down), and in each direction, it finds the first unvisited cell. Then, among these four cells, it selects the one with the smallest number. That's the next cell.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple unvisited cells in different directions? Like, if the current cell is somewhere in the middle, and all four directions have unvisited cells. Then, the rook would look at the four cells in each direction (the closest unvisited cell in each direction) and pick the one with the smallest number.\n\nSo, for the rook, the next cell is the minimal among the four closest unvisited cells in its row, column, or diagonal.\n\nWait, but the rook can also choose to move diagonally. Oh right! So the four directions include all eight possible directions? No, wait, no. Because for the rook, it's only four directions: up, down, left, right. Because the rook moves in straight lines either horizontally or vertically. Diagonal movement is for the queen.\n\nWait, no. The rook doesn't",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to construct an N x N chessboard such that the rook pays strictly fewer vuns than the queen when following their respective movement rules. If it's not possible, we should output -1.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to realize that the rook and queen have different movement capabilities. The rook can only move in straight lines (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), while the queen can move in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal). \n\nThe problem can be approached by arranging the numbers on the board such that the rook's path involves fewer teleportations compared to the queen's. This can be achieved by ensuring that the rook's next move is always towards the smallest unvisited cell in its current row, column, or diagonal, while the queen's next move is towards the smallest unvisited cell in her current row, column, or diagonal as well. By carefully arranging the numbers, we can minimize the number of teleportations for the rook.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    N = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    if N == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    # For N >=2, we need a specific arrangement.\n    # We'll construct a grid where rows are arranged in a way that \n    # the rook's path has fewer teleports than the queen's.\n    \n    # Create the grid with a specific pattern.\n    grid = []\n    for i in range(N):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(N):\n            if i == 0 and j == 0:\n                row.append(1)\n            else:\n                row.append(2 * i + j + (i * N + j) // 2 % 2)\n        grid.append(row)\n    \n    # Now, simulate the paths for both rook and queen to count the vuns.\n    \n    # Function to get next move for rook\n    def get_rook_next(r, c, visited):\n        min_val = float('inf')\n        min_pos = None\n        directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < N and 0 <= nc < N:\n                if not visited[nr][nc]:\n                    val = grid[nr][nc]\n                    if val < min_val:\n                        min_val = val\n                        min_pos = (nr, nc)\n        return min_pos\n    \n    # Function to get next move for queen\n    def get_queen_next(r, c, visited):\n        min_val = float('inf')\n        min_pos = None\n        for i in range(N):\n            for j in range(N):\n                if not visited[i][j]:\n                    val = grid[i][j]\n                    if val < min_val:\n                        min_val = val\n                        min_pos = (i, j)\n        return min_pos\n    \n    # Initialize visited matrix\n    visited = [[False for _ in range(N)] for __ in range(N)]\n    visited[0][0] = True\n    \n    # Simulate rook's path\n    rook_vuns = 0\n    rook_pos = (0, 0)\n    while True:\n        next_pos = get_rook_next(rook_pos[0], rook_pos[1], visited)\n        if next_pos is None:\n            break\n        visited[next_pos[0]][next_pos[1]] = True\n        if next_pos != get_rook_next(rook_pos[0], rook_pos[1], visited):\n            rook_vuns += 1\n        rook_pos = next_pos\n    \n    # Simulate queen's path\n    queen_vuns = 0\n    queen_pos = (0, 0)\n    while True:\n        next_pos = get_queen_next(queen_pos[0], queen_pos[1], visited)\n        if next_pos is None:\n            break\n        visited[next_pos[0]][next_pos[1]] = True\n        if next_pos != get_queen_next(queen_pos[0], queen_pos[1], visited):\n            queen_vuns += 1\n        queen_pos = next_pos\n    \n    if rook_vuns < queen_vuns:\n        for row in grid:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n    else:\n        print(-1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution constructs an N x N grid where the numbers are arranged in a specific pattern. The grid is designed such that the rook's path involves fewer teleportations compared to the queen's.
