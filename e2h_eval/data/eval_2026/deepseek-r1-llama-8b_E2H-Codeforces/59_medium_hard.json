    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think through it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of arrays of sets that satisfy certain conditions. Hmm, let's see. The key points are:\n\n- Each set in the array can contain any subset of integers from 1 to K.\n- The array needs to be rearrangeable such that each consecutive pair in the rearranged order has the child relationship. That means, for S'_i to be a child of S'_{i+1}, every element x in S'_i must have x+1 present in S'_{i+1}.\n\nAnd we need to count all possible arrays of N such sets, modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the child condition implies. So for two sets A and B, B is a child of A if for every x in A, x+1 is in B. Wait, no, wait: the definition says that A is a child of B if for each x in A, there's an x+1 in B. So, S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}, meaning that when you look at S'_i, every element x in it must have x+1 in S'_{i+1}.\n\nSo, the condition after rearrangement is that the sequence forms a chain where each set is a child of the next one.\n\nHmm. So the problem reduces to arranging the sets in an order where each is a parent of the next, but the actual order of the array can be any permutation that satisfies this.\n\nWait, but how does this affect the possible sets in the array? Maybe each set in the array must be compatible with being part of such a chain.\n\nI think it's helpful to model each set as a bitmask, where each bit represents whether a particular integer is present. For example, K=2 would have bits for 1 and 2.\n\nBut then, the child condition requires that for any set S, its successor in the chain must contain all the elements of S except possibly some, but more importantly, for every x in S, x+1 must be present in the next set.\n\nWait, no. Because S' is a child of S'' if for every x in S', x+1 is in S''. So S'' must have all x+1 for each x in S'.\n\nWhich means that S'' must include all elements that are one more than any element in S'. So S'' is at least as large as S' shifted by +1.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the sets in terms of their \"parent\" sets. Or perhaps, for each set, determine which sets can come after it in the chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled using dynamic programming. Let's think about the constraints on the sets.\n\nEach set in the array must form a chain where each set is a parent of the next. So, the entire array must be such that there exists a permutation of the array into a sequence S_1, S_2, ..., S_N where S_i is a parent of S_{i+1}.\n\nThis implies that the sets must form a chain in terms of inclusion and the +1 condition.\n\nWait, maybe the sets can be thought of as nodes in a DAG, and the chains are paths in this DAG. But with N up to 2e5, building such a graph isn't feasible.\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach. Let's consider the minimal possible sets that can appear in the array.\n\nEach set S can be characterized by the maximum element it contains. Let's say m is the maximum element in S. Then, for S to be a child of another set T, T must contain m+1 (if m+1 <= K). Otherwise, T cannot have S as a child.\n\nWait, no. Because for every x in S, x+1 must be in T. So, if S contains x = m, then T must have m+1. So, the maximum of S is m, so T must have m+1. So, the maximum of T must be at least m+1.\n\nWait, yes. Because if S has maximum m, then T must have m+1. So T's maximum is >= m+1.\n\nMoreover, T may have a higher maximum than m+1, but as long as it includes all elements in S plus their increments.\n\nWait, no. Let's say S has elements {1,3}. Then T must have 2 and 4. So T could be {2,4}, or {2,3,4}, etc.\n\nBut in terms of the maximum, T's maximum is at least 4, since S has 3. So T must have 4.\n\nSo, the maximum of T is >= (max of S) + 1.\n\nBut what about the other elements? If S has elements 1 and 3, T must have 2 and 4. So T's elements must include all x+1 for x in S.\n\nSo, the structure of T is determined by S: T must include all x+1 where x is in S. Additionally, T can have any elements beyond those.\n\nWait, but T's elements are arbitrary except that they must include all x+1 for x in S.\n\nWait, no. Because the child condition is only that for each x in S, x+1 is in T. It doesn't restrict T from having other elements beyond those. So, for example, if S is {1}, T can be {2}, or {2,3}, or {2,4}, etc., as long as it includes 2.\n\nBut in the context of the chain, when considering T as the next set after S, T's elements can include any additional elements, but must include all the x+1 for x in S.\n\nSo, perhaps each set can be represented by its \"base\" elements, which are the required x+1 elements. And then, any additional elements beyond that base are optional.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into considering the sets as nodes in a graph where edges represent the possibility of one set following another in the chain. But again, with N up to 2e5, this seems difficult.\n\nAnother angle: What is the structure of the valid arrays?\n\nEach array must be a sequence where each set is a parent of the next. So, the sets must form a chain in the sense that each next set is a superset of the previous in terms of the x+1 condition.\n\nWait, no. Because the child condition is not about subsets. It's about the presence of x+1 for each x in the current set.\n\nSo, the chain is such that each step must include all x+1 of the previous.\n\nWait, perhaps the sets can be arranged in a way similar to a tree where each node is a superset of the next. No, because the next set can have more elements, but the condition is that for the current set, all x+1 are present.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each set in the chain must have a maximum element that is exactly one more than the maximum of the previous set. Wait, no. Because the maximum of the next set must be at least the maximum of the current plus one.\n\nBut that's a necessary condition, but not sufficient. For example, if the current set has max m, the next set must have max >= m+1. But it's possible that the next set has max m+2, but doesn't include m+1. Wait, no, because for the current set S, which includes m, the next set T must include m+1. So, T's maximum is at least m+1.\n\nWait, that's right. Because S has x=m, so T must have m+1. Therefore, T's maximum is at least m+1.\n\nBut what about if T's maximum is m+2? Then, T must have m+1, which is covered, but what about other elements?\n\nFor example, suppose S is {1,3}, so T must have 2 and 4. So T's maximum is 4, which is m+1 for S's m=3.\n\nWait, but if S is {1,3}, then T must have 2 and 4. So T's maximum is 4.\n\nSo, in general, the next set's maximum is m+1, where m is the maximum of the current set.\n\nWait, because the current set's maximum is m, so the next set must have m+1. So the next set's maximum is at least m+1. But can it be higher?\n\nYes. For example, S is {2}, so T must have 3. So T can be {3}, or {3,4}, etc.\n\nSo, the next set can have a maximum larger than m+1, but it must include m+1.\n\nHmm. So the maximum of the next set must be >= current's maximum +1.\n\nSo, for the chain of sets S_1, S_2, ..., S_n, the maximums form a non-decreasing sequence, where each step is at least one more than the previous.\n\nWait, no. Because each step's maximum is at least the previous's maximum +1. So the maximums are strictly increasing.\n\nAh, right! Because each step's maximum must be at least one more than the previous step's maximum. So, the maximums form a strictly increasing sequence.\n\nTherefore, the maximum of the i-th set in the chain must be exactly i + m_0 -1, where m_0 is the maximum of the first set.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's see: Suppose the first set has maximum m0. Then the second set must have maximum >= m0 +1. The third set must have maximum >= (m0 +1) +1, and so on. So the maximums are m0, m0+1, m0+2, ..., m0 + (n-1). Or wait, no. Because each step can have a maximum greater than the required, but it must be at least the previous step's maximum +1.\n\nWait, no. Because for the second set, its maximum must be at least m0 +1. For the third set, it must be at least (second set's maximum) +1, which would be at least (m0+1)+1 = m0+2. So, the third set's maximum is at least m0+2. So, the maximums form a sequence m0, m0+1, m0+2, ..., m0 + (n-1).\n\nWait, yes. Because each step's maximum must be at least one more than the previous. So, for n steps, the maximums are m0, m0+1, ..., m0 +n-1.\n\nSo, the maximum of the i-th set in the chain is m0 + i -1.\n\nBut wait, the array can be any permutation of the sets that allows such a chain. So the array's sets can be arranged in any order as long as the above condition holds.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem allows us to choose any permutation of the array of sets such that the permutation is a chain. So, the array can be any multiset of N sets, and when arranged in some order, each consecutive pair satisfies the child condition.\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to choosing a multiset of N sets, where there exists a way to arrange them in a chain where each is a child of the next.\n\nBut how do we model this? It's tricky.\n\nAlternative approach: Think about each set as a bitmask, and model the constraints on the sets.\n\nEach set S in the array must be such that for any other set T in the array, either S can be followed by T in the chain, or T can be followed by S, or neither. But for the chain to exist, the sets must be ordered in a way that each consecutive pair is compatible.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nWait, perhaps the key insight is that the sets must form a chain where the maximum elements are strictly increasing. Because each step's maximum must be at least one more than the previous. So, the maximum of each set in the chain must be in a strictly increasing order.\n\nSo, for the array to be rearrangeable into a chain, all the sets must have maximums that can be arranged in a strictly increasing sequence.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. Because if the array contains multiple sets with the same maximum, then it's impossible to arrange them in a chain. Because each step's maximum must be strictly larger than the previous.\n\nWait, no. Because in the chain, each step's maximum is at least one more than the previous. So, for example, two sets with the same maximum can't both appear in the chain, because their maximums would not be strictly increasing.\n\nTherefore, in the array, the maximums of the sets must be unique and can be arranged in a strictly increasing order.\n\nSo, the first thing to note is that the array must consist of N sets whose maximum elements are all distinct and form a strictly increasing sequence. Because otherwise, it's impossible to arrange them in a chain where each step's maximum is at least one more than the previous.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Because for example, if two sets have the same maximum, say m, then in the chain, one must come before the other, but since their maximums are equal, the second set cannot be a child of the first. Because the first set's maximum is m, so the second set must have m+1, but it doesn't. So, it's impossible for two sets with the same maximum to be in the same chain.\n\nThus, in the array, all N sets must have distinct maximum values, and these maximums must form a strictly increasing sequence when arranged in the correct order.\n\nSo, the maximum of each set in the array must be a unique value between 1 and K, and their arrangement must be in order of increasing maximum.\n\nWait, but the maximum can't exceed K. So, the maximum of each set in the array must be a subset of {1, 2, ..., K}, and all N sets must have distinct maximums.\n\nWait, but if N > K, then it's impossible because there are only K possible maximum values. So, the constraints imply that N must be <= K.\n\nWait, no, because K can be up to 2e5, and N can also be up to 2e5. So, if N > K, then it's impossible to have N distinct maximums, hence the answer is zero.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So, the first thing to check is whether N > K. If yes, output zero.\n\nOtherwise, for N <= K, the problem becomes manageable.\n\nSo, the first step in the solution is to check if N > K. If so, output zero.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to counting the number of arrays of N sets, each with distinct maximums, and for each set S in the array, all x+1 for x in S are included in the next set in the chain.\n\nWait, but the array can be any permutation of the sets as long as the chain exists. So, the maximums must be a permutation of some N distinct values in {1, 2, ..., K}, and arranged in increasing order.\n\nBut how do the sets relate to each other in terms of their elements?\n\nEach set S_i must be a subset of the next set S_{i+1}'s base elements. Wait, no. Because S_i is a child of S_{i+1}, which means that every element x in S_i must have x+1 in S_{i+1}.\n\nBut S_{i+1} can have other elements as well.\n\nSo, S_{i+1} must contain all x+1 where x is in S_i.\n\nSo, for the chain S_1 â†’ S_2 â†’ ... â†’ S_N, each S_{i+1} must include all x+1 from S_i.\n\nBut the chain is not fixed; the array can be any permutation that forms such a chain. So, the problem is to count all possible arrays of N sets with distinct maximums, such that there exists a permutation of the array into a chain where each consecutive pair satisfies the child condition.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps, for each possible chain of maximums m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N, we can compute the number of possible arrays of sets that can form such a chain, and then sum over all possible chains.\n\nBut even this seems challenging because the number of possible chains is C(K, N), which for K=2e5 and N=2e5 is 1. So, for N=K, it's just one possible chain.\n\nWait, but for each chain, the sets are determined by their maximum and the required x+1 elements.\n\nWait, let's think about a single chain: m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N.\n\nEach set S_i must contain all x+1 where x is in S_{i-1}.\n\nWait, no. Because S_i is a child of S_j, which comes after it in the chain. So, S_j must have all x+1 for x in S_i.\n\nBut in the chain, S_j is after S_i, so S_i is a child of S_j.\n\nWait, but in the array, when arranged in the chain order S_1, S_2, ..., S_N, each S_i is a child of S_{i+1}.\n\nSo, for each i, S_{i+1} must contain all x+1 for x in S_i.\n\nBut S_i can have any elements, as long as they are <= m_i.\n\nWait, but S_i's maximum is m_i, so S_{i+1} must have m_i +1, which is m_{i+1}.\n\nSo, for the chain, m_{i+1} = m_i +1.\n\nWait, because S_i has maximum m_i, so S_{i+1} must have m_i +1, which is the next maximum.\n\nSo, in the chain, the maximums must form a sequence m_1, m_1+1, m_1+2, ..., m_1 + N-1.\n\nBecause each step's maximum is exactly the previous plus 1.\n\nWait, this seems to be a crucial point.\n\nLet me rephrase: Since each S_i has maximum m_i, and S_{i+1} must have maximum at least m_i +1, but the chain must have strictly increasing maximums. So, in the chain, m_{i+1} = m_i + 1.\n\nBecause if m_{i+1} were larger than m_i +1, then S_i would have a maximum m_i, so S_{i+1} must include m_i +1, but m_{i+1} could be larger. However, for the next step, S_{i+2} must include m_{i+1} +1, which is m_i + 2.\n\nSo, in any case, the maximums must form a consecutive increasing sequence starting from m_1.\n\nTherefore, for a chain of length N, the maximums are m_1, m_1+1, m_1+2, ..., m_1 + N-1.\n\nSo, the maximum of the chain is determined by m_1, and the chain is forced to have maximums in a consecutive sequence.\n\nTherefore, for the chain to exist, the maximums must form a consecutive sequence of length N, starting from some m_1, where m_1 + N-1 <= K.\n\nThus, the possible chains are determined by choosing m_1 such that m_1 + N-1 <= K. So, m_1 can range from 1 to K - N +1.\n\nOnce m_1 is chosen, the chain is fixed as m_1, m_1+1, ..., m_1 + N-1.\n\nNow, for each such chain, the problem is to count the number of ways to choose the sets S_1, S_2, ..., S_N such that:\n\n- S_i has maximum m_i.\n\n- S_{i} is a subset of the required elements for S_{i+1}.\n\nWait, no. The condition is that for S_i to be a child of S_{i+1}, S_{i+1} must contain x+1 for every x in S_i.\n\nSo, for each i, S_{i+1} must include all x+1 for x in S_i.\n\nBut S_{i+1} can have any other elements, including those beyond m_{i+1}.\n\nWait, no. Because S_{i+1} has maximum m_{i+1} = m_i +1. So, the maximum of S_{i+1} is m_i +1. Thus, S_{i+1} cannot have any elements beyond m_i +1.\n\nWait, because the maximum is the largest element in the set. So, S_{i+1} can't have any elements larger than m_i +1. So, all elements in S_{i+1} are <= m_i +1.\n\nThus, for each i, S_{i+1} must be a superset of {x+1 | x in S_i}, but can't have any elements beyond m_i +1.\n\nWait, but S_{i+1} can have elements less than m_i +1, as long as they include all x+1 from S_i.\n\nSo, for example, S_i could be {1}, so S_{i+1} must include 2, but can also include 3, etc., as long as 3 is <= m_i +1.\n\nWait, but m_i+1 is m_{i}+1, which is the maximum of S_{i+1}. So, S_{i+1} can't have elements larger than m_i +1.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFor a chain starting at m_1, the maximums are m_1, m_1+1, ..., m_1 + N-1.\n\nEach set S_i has maximum m_i.\n\nS_{i+1} must include all x+1 for x in S_i.\n\nMoreover, S_{i+1} can't have any elements beyond m_i+1.\n\nSo, the structure is as follows:\n\nFor S_1: it can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., m_1}, but cannot be empty? Wait, no, S_1 can be empty, because it's allowed.\n\nWait, no, wait. The problem statement says each set can contain zero or more elements. So, S_1 can be empty.\n\nBut if S_1 is empty, then S_2 can be any subset of {2, ..., m_1+1}, since S_1 has no elements, so S_2 can have any elements, as long as they don't violate the maximum m_2 = m_1+1.\n\nWait, but if S_1 is empty, then S_2 can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., m_1+1}.\n\nBecause for S_1 being empty, the condition is automatically satisfied for S_2 (since there are no x in S_1 to require x+1 in S_2).\n\nSo, for each step, S_i can be any subset of {a, a+1, ..., b}, where a is 1 and b is m_i, but S_i's elements must include x+1 for x in S_{i-1}.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the process step by step.\n\nLet me think about the chain S_1, S_2, ..., S_N.\n\nEach S_i has maximum m_i = m_1 + i-1.\n\nWe need to choose S_1, S_2, ..., S_N such that for each i, S_{i+1} includes all x+1 for x in S_i.\n\nAdditionally, S_{i+1} must be a subset of {1, 2, ..., m_{i+1}}.\n\nSo, for each i from 1 to N-1:\n\n- Let A_i be the set of elements in S_i.\n\n- Then, S_{i+1} must include A_i + 1 = {x+1 | x in A_i}.\n\n- Moreover, S_{i+1} can include any other elements from {1, 2, ..., m_{i+1}} \\ (A_i +1).\n\nBut also, S_{i+1} cannot include any elements larger than m_{i+1}.\n\nWait, but S_{i+1} can't have elements larger than m_{i+1}, since that's the maximum.\n\nSo, for each i, the elements of S_{i+1} are a superset of (A_i +1) union B_i, where B_i is a subset of {1, 2, ..., m_{i+1}} \\ (A_i +1).\n\nBut wait, no. Because S_{i+1} can have any elements, as long as all x+1 for x in S_i are present. So, S_{i+1} can have any elements from {1, 2, ..., m_{i+1}}, but must include all x+1 from S_i.\n\nSo, the elements of S_{i+1} can be written as (A_i +1) âˆª C_i, where C_i is any subset of {1, 2, ..., m_{i+1}} \\ (A_i +1).\n\nBut since S_{i+1} can have any elements, including those not in A_i +1.\n\nWait, but S_{i+1} can have elements that are not in A_i +1, but those elements must be <= m_{i+1}.\n\nSo, for each step i, S_{i+1} can be any superset of (A_i +1) that is a subset of {1, 2, ..., m_{i+1}}.\n\nWait, no. Because S_{i+1} must include all x+1 for x in S_i, but can include any other elements, provided they are <= m_{i+1}.\n\nSo, S_{i+1} must include (A_i +1), and can include any subset of {1, 2, ..., m_{i+1}} \\ (A_i +1}.\n\nSo, the number of possible S_{i+1} is 2^{d_i}, where d_i is the number of elements in {1, 2, ..., m_{i+1}} \\ (A_i +1}.\n\nBut this depends on A_i, which is S_i.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated because the choice of S_i affects the choices for S_{i+1}.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this with dynamic programming, considering the constraints.\n\nLet's think recursively. For each step i, the state is the set of elements in S_i. But with K up to 2e5, this is impossible.\n\nAlternative idea: For each step i, model the state based on the current set's maximum m_i, and the required elements that must be present in S_{i+1}.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that for each step, the set S_{i+1} must include the set (S_i +1). So, the elements of S_{i+1} are exactly (S_i +1) union some subset of the remaining elements.\n\nBut the remaining elements are those not in (S_i +1), and also <= m_{i+1}.\n\nWait, but m_{i+1} is fixed as m_i +1.\n\nSo, for step i, S_i has maximum m_i. Then, S_{i+1} must include (S_i +1), and can include any subset of {1, 2, ..., m_i+1} \\ (S_i +1}.\n\nBut the maximum of S_{i+1} is m_i+1, so S_{i+1} can't have any elements larger than that.\n\nBut wait, S_{i+1} can have elements up to m_i+1, regardless of whether they are in (S_i +1) or not.\n\nWait, no. Because S_i's maximum is m_i, so S_{i+1} must have m_i+1 as an element. Because S_i has m_i, so S_{i+1} must have m_i+1.\n\nWait, that's right. So, S_{i+1} must include m_i+1.\n\nWait, because m_i is the maximum of S_i, so x = m_i is in S_i. Therefore, S_{i+1} must include m_i +1.\n\nAh, that's a crucial point. So, for each i, S_{i+1} must include m_i+1.\n\nBut also, S_{i+1} must include all x+1 for x in S_i. So, if S_i has x = k, then S_{i+1} must have k+1.\n\nSo, for S_{i+1}, it must include m_i +1, and also all x+1 for x in S_i.\n\nBut since m_i is the maximum of S_i, x+1 for x in S_i will include m_i+1 as well as possibly others.\n\nWait, yes. Because S_i contains x = m_i, so x+1 is m_i+1, which is already required to be in S_{i+1}.\n\nSo, the requirement for S_{i+1} is:\n\n- S_{i+1} must include all x+1 for x in S_i.\n\nWhich is the same as S_{i+1} must include (S_i +1).\n\nBut since S_{i+1} must include m_i+1, which is already in (S_i +1), this condition is satisfied.\n\nSo, for each step i, S_{i+1} must include (S_i +1), which is a subset of {1, 2, ..., m_i+1}.\n\nWait, but (S_i +1) is a subset of {2, 3, ..., m_i +1}.\n\nSo, S_{i+1} can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., m_i +1} that includes (S_i +1), and also includes m_i +1 (but that's already included in S_i +1).\n\nSo, the number of options for S_{i+1} is the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., m_i +1} that include (S_i +1).\n\nWait, but (S_i +1) is a specific set. So, for S_{i+1}, the required elements are (S_i +1), and it can include any other elements from {1, 2, ..., m_i +1} \\ (S_i +1}.\n\nSo, the number of options for S_{i+1} is 2^{d_i}, where d_i is the number of elements in {1, 2, ..., m_i +1} \\ (S_i +1}.\n\nBut d_i can vary depending on S_i.\n\nThis seems difficult to model directly.\n\nBut perhaps there's a pattern here.\n\nLet me think about the process in terms of the maximum and the required elements.\n\nSince S_{i+1} must include all x+1 from S_i, and must have maximum m_{i+1} = m_i +1, perhaps the elements of S_{i+1} can be expressed as (S_i +1) âˆª T_i, where T_i is a subset of {1, 2, ..., m_i+1} \\ (S_i +1}.\n\nBut T_i can be any subset, including the empty set.\n\nSo, the number of options for S_{i+1} given S_i is 2^{c_i}, where c_i is the number of elements in {1, 2, ..., m_i+1} \\ (S_i +1}.\n\nBut c_i is equal to (m_i+1) - |S_i +1|.\n\nBut S_i +1 is exactly the set {x+1 | x in S_i}.\n\nWait, but S_i can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., m_i}, so S_i +1 can vary.\n\nThis seems tricky.\n\nAlternative idea: For a fixed chain of maximums, how many possible arrays of sets are there?\n\nLet me consider that for a chain starting at m_1, the maximums are m_1, m_1+1, ..., m_1 + N-1.\n\nThen, for each step i, S_{i} must be a subset of {1, 2, ..., m_i}, and S_{i+1} must include S_i +1, which is a subset of {2, 3, ..., m_i +1}.\n\nBut S_{i+1} can include any elements beyond S_i +1, as long as they are <= m_{i+1}.\n\nWait, but S_{i+1} must have maximum m_{i+1} = m_i +1.\n\nSo, S_{i+1} can't have any elements larger than m_i+1.\n\nSo, for each step i, the elements of S_{i+1} are exactly (S_i +1) âˆª T_i, where T_i is a subset of {1, 2, ..., m_i+1} \\ (S_i +1}.\n\nBut also, S_{i+1} can't have any elements larger than m_i+1, which is already ensured.\n\nSo, the number of choices for S_{i+1} is 2^{k_i}, where k_i is the number of elements in {1, 2, ..., m_i+1} \\ (S_i +1}.\n\nBut k_i depends on S_i.\n\nThis suggests that the total number of arrays for a given chain is the product of the number of choices at each step, which depends on the choices made at the previous step.\n\nThis seems like a multiplicative process, but the dependence makes it difficult to model.\n\nWait, but perhaps for a given chain, the number of possible arrays can be computed as a product over i from 1 to N of (2^{a_i}), where a_i is the number of new elements available at step i.\n\nWait, perhaps we can find a pattern or formula that allows us to compute this.\n\nLet me consider the first step.\n\nFor S_1: it can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., m_1}.\n\nThen, S_2 must include S_1 +1. Also, S_2's maximum is m_1 +1.\n\nSo, S_2 can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., m_1 +1} that includes S_1 +1.\n\nSo, the number of options for S_2 is 2^{d_1}, where d_1 is the number of elements in {1, 2, ..., m_1 +1} \\ (S_1 +1}.\n\nBut d_1 = (m_1 +1) - |S_1 +1|.\n\nWait, but S_1 is a subset of {1, 2, ..., m_1}, so S_1 +1 is a subset of {2, 3, ..., m_1 +1}.\n\nSo, the size of S_1 +1 is |S_1|.\n\nThus, d_1 = (m_1 +1) - |S_1|.\n\nWait, no, because S_1 +1 is exactly the set {x+1 | x âˆˆ S_1}, which has size |S_1|.\n\nSo, the number of elements not in S_1 +1 is (m_1 +1) - |S_1|.\n\nWait, but m_1+1 is the maximum of S_2.\n\nSo, d_1 = (m_1 +1) - |S_1|.\n\nBut this depends on |S_1|, which varies for each S_1.\n\nThis seems difficult to model.\n\nAlternative idea: For each step, the number of options is independent of the specific elements chosen, but depends only on the size of S_i.\n\nWait, perhaps for each step i, the number of options is 2^{(m_{i+1} - (size of S_i +1))}.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, for S_i, the size is s_i. Then, S_i +1 has size s_i.\n\nThe number of elements available for T_i is (m_{i+1} - s_i) - (m_{i+1} - (s_i +1)) ? No, perhaps not.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this for each step, considering that for each step, the number of new elements added to S_{i+1} beyond S_i +1 is variable.\n\nBut perhaps for a given chain, the total number of arrays is the product over each step of the number of choices for that step.\n\nBut the problem is that each step's choices depend on the previous step's choices.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of arrays is the product for each i from 1 to N of 2^{something}, where the exponent depends on the chain.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given chain, the number of arrays is (product for i=1 to N) (2^{f_i}), where f_i is the number of elements that can be freely chosen at step i.\n\nBut what's f_i?\n\nAt step i, when choosing S_i, the next step S_{i+1} must include S_i +1. But S_{i+1} can also include any subset of the elements not in S_i +1, as long as they are <= m_{i+1}.\n\nSo, the number of options for S_{i+1} is 2^{d_i}, where d_i is the number of elements in {1, 2, ..., m_{i+1}} \\ (S_i +1}.\n\nBut d_i = (m_{i+1} - (s_i +1)), where s_i is the size of S_i.\n\nWait, because S_i +1 has size s_i, and m_{i+1} is the maximum of S_{i+1}.\n\nWait, but S_{i+1} can't have elements beyond m_{i",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of valid arrays of sets that can be rearranged into a chain where each set is a parent of the next. The key insight is that the maximum elements of these sets must form a strictly increasing sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each set in the array must be able to follow another set in a chain where the next set includes all elements incremented by one from the current set. This means the maximum element of each subsequent set must be exactly one more than the previous set's maximum.\n\n2. **Constraints Handling**: If the number of sets \\( N \\) is greater than \\( K \\), it's impossible to have \\( N \\) distinct maximum values, so the result is zero.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: For each possible starting maximum value \\( m_1 \\), the maximum values form a consecutive sequence \\( m_1, m_1+1, \\ldots, m_1 + N - 1 \\). The number of valid arrays for each starting maximum is computed using combinatorial methods.\n\n4. **Combinatorial Counting**: For each step, the number of valid sets is determined by the number of ways to include required elements and additional optional elements, leading to a product of powers of two.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    N, K = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    if N > K:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Precompute factorial and inverse factorial modulo MOD\n    max_n = N\n    fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):\n        fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD\n    \n    inv_fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    inv_fact[max_n] = pow(fact[max_n], MOD-2, MOD)\n    for i in range(max_n-1, -1, -1):\n        inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD\n    \n    def comb(n, k):\n        if n < 0 or k < 0 or k > n:\n            return 0\n        return fact[n] * inv_fact[k] % MOD * inv_fact[n - k] % MOD\n    \n    total = 0\n    for m1 in range(1, K - N + 2):\n        chain_max = m1 + N - 1\n        if chain_max > K:\n            continue\n        \n        # Now, compute the product for this chain\n        res = 1\n        for i in range(N):\n            # At step i, S_i has max m1 + i\n            # S_{i+1} must include all x+1 from S_i, and have max m1 + i +1\n            # So, the number of options is 2^{d}, where d is the number of elements not in (S_i +1) up to m1 + i +1\n            # But since S_{i+1} must include m1 + i +1, which is already in S_i +1 (since S_i has max m1 + i)\n            # So, the number of elements not in S_i +1 is (m1 + i +1 - |S_i +1|) - 1 (since m1 + i +1 is included)\n            # Wait, perhaps for each step, the number of free elements is (m1 + i) - s_i, where s_i is |S_i|\n            # Because S_i +1 has size s_i, and the next set can include any subset of the remaining elements up to m1 + i +1\n            # So, the number of elements available is (m1 + i +1 - s_i)\n            # But wait, S_{i+1} must include m1 + i +1, which is already part of S_i +1?\n            # No, S_i has maximum m1 + i, so S_i +1 includes m1 + i +1.\n            # So, S_{i+1} must include m1 + i +1, but also can include other elements not in S_i +1, up to m1 + i +1.\n            # So, the number of elements available for T_i is (m1 + i +1 - (s_i)) - 1, because m1 + i +1 is already included.\n            # Wait, no: S_i +1 has size s_i, which includes all x+1 for x in S_i.
