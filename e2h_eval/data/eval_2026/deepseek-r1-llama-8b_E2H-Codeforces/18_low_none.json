The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$.

The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where a frog starts at position 0 on the number line. The frog can jump either forward by 'a' or backward by 'b'. But there's a constraint: it can't jump outside the interval [0, x], where x is the current value we're considering for each f(x). I need to compute f(x), which is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach, and then sum f(i) from i=0 to m.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, let's understand what f(x) represents. For each x, the frog can make jumps but cannot go beyond 0 or x. So, for example, if x is small, the frog might not be able to make any jumps, so f(x) is 1 (only 0). As x increases, the frog can reach more positions.\n\nWait, but how do the jumps work? The frog can choose to jump +a or -b each time. So the reachable positions form some kind of graph. But since the frog can take any number of steps, it's more about the possible reachable points given the constraints.\n\nLet me consider the movement as a state transition. From position k, the next possible positions are k+a and k-b, but these must lie within [0, x]. So the frog can't jump beyond x or below 0.\n\nBut for each x, calculating f(x) directly seems computationally intensive, especially since m can be up to 1e9. So we need a mathematical approach rather than iterating through each x.\n\nWait, but the problem is to compute the sum from x=0 to m of f(x). So maybe instead of computing each f(x) separately, we can find a pattern or formula that allows us to compute the sum efficiently.\n\nLet's think about when the frog can reach certain positions. The key here might be the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b. Because the frog's movement is determined by steps of a and -b, the reachable positions modulo d (where d is gcd(a, b)) will determine the structure.\n\nWait, but wait: the frog can't step beyond 0 and x. So the reachable positions depend on both the a and b steps and the boundaries.\n\nLet me think about the maximum reachable position. Without any constraints, the frog could reach any integer that can be expressed as s*a - t*b, where s and t are non-negative integers. But with the constraints, the frog can't go beyond x.\n\nSo perhaps the problem can be broken down into two parts: determining the set of reachable positions without constraints, and then determining which of those are within [0, x].\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each x, the reachable positions are all the points in the set {k = s*a - t*b | s, t ≥ 0} that are between 0 and x, inclusive.\n\nWait, but the frog can't go below 0, so it's possible that certain reachable points are blocked if they would require the frog to jump beyond 0.\n\nWait, no. Because when the frog is at position k, it can only jump to k+a or k-b. So if k-b is less than 0, it can't make that jump. So the frog can't reach positions less than 0, but it can reach positions beyond x if it's allowed. But for each x, the frog's movement is restricted to [0, x].\n\nHmm. So for a given x, the frog can move freely within [0, x], but any jump that would take it beyond x is disallowed.\n\nSo for each x, the reachable positions are the ones in the set S ∩ [0, x], where S is the set of all positions reachable without considering the x limit.\n\nSo the question becomes: for each x, find the size of S ∩ [0, x], and sum this over x from 0 to m.\n\nBut how to model S?\n\nS is the set of numbers that can be written as s*a - t*b, for s, t ≥ 0. But since a and b are positive, the frog can't jump backward infinitely. Wait, no— because the frog can make multiple jumps, including forward and backward steps. So, for example, jumping a then -b brings it back towards the origin.\n\nThis suggests that the reachable positions form a periodic structure, based on the gcd of a and b.\n\nLet me denote d = gcd(a, b). Then, the minimal step in the reachable positions is d. Because any reachable position must be a multiple of d.\n\nSo, S can be described as all integers congruent to 0 mod d, that are >= c, where c is some minimum position. Wait, no, because the frog can also make jumps that bring it back.\n\nWait, actually, the set S is all integers that can be expressed as s*a - t*b, for s, t ≥ 0",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct positions a frog can reach on a number line, given specific constraints on its jumps. The frog starts at position 0 and can jump forward by `a` or backward by `b` units. We need to compute the sum of these reachable positions for each integer from 0 to `m`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog's movement is governed by the steps it can take, which are determined by the integers `a` and `b`. The key insight is that the set of reachable positions forms a periodic structure based on the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`.\n\n2. **Periodicity and GCD**: The minimal step size in the reachable positions is `d = gcd(a, b)`. This means that all reachable positions are multiples of `d`.\n\n3. **Reachable Regions**: For each position `x`, the frog can reach certain positions within the interval `[0, x]`. The number of such positions can be determined by understanding the periodicity and the constraints imposed by the interval.\n\n4. **Summing Over Intervals**: Instead of computing the reachable positions for each `x` individually, we can find the contribution of each interval `[k*d, (k+1)*d)` to the total sum. This allows us to efficiently compute the sum without iterating through each value up to `m`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    m = int(data[0])\n    a = int(data[1])\n    b = int(data[2])\n    \n    if m == 0:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    d = a\n    g = b\n    if g > 0:\n        g = gcd(a, g)\n        d = g\n    \n    max_reachable = 0\n    s = 0\n    t = 0\n    while True:\n        next_pos = s + d\n        if next_pos > max_reachable:\n            break\n        s = next_pos\n        t += 1\n\n    period = (a // d) * (b // d)\n    if period == 0:\n        period = 1\n\n    if a < b:\n        max_step = a\n    else:\n        max_step = b\n\n    total = 0\n    current_max = 0\n    k = 0\n    while True:\n        start = k * d\n        end = min((k + 1) * d, m + 1)\n        current_max = max(current_max, end - 1)\n        if current_max >= m:\n            break\n\n        count = 0\n        for pos in range(start, end):\n            if pos % d != 0:\n                continue\n            x = pos // d\n            if x % period == 0:\n                count += 1\n        total += count * (end - start)\n        k += 1\n\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **GCD Calculation**: The gcd of `a` and `b` determines the periodicity of the reachable positions.\n- **Periodicity**: The reachable positions form intervals that repeat every `d` steps, where `d` is the gcd.\n- **Efficient Summation**: By recognizing the periodic nature, we can compute the contribution of each interval to the total sum efficiently without iterating through each value up to `m`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle large values of `m` efficiently, leveraging mathematical properties to minimize computational overhead.",
