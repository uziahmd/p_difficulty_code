Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form .

That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a regular polygon, each internal angle can be calculated. The formula for the internal angle of a regular n-gon is (n-2)*180 / n degrees. But wait, that's the internal angle. But when forming an angle with three vertices, how does that translate?\n\nWait, no, the problem is about creating an angle by selecting three points v1, v2, v3. The angle is formed at v2, between the two lines from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. So I need to find the possible angles that can be formed by any triplet of vertices in the polygon.\n\nBut since the polygon is regular, the positions of the vertices are symmetric. So maybe there's a pattern or a way to calculate the possible angles without checking every possible triplet, which would be computationally expensive for large n.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the polygon. For a regular n-gon, each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. So the angle between two adjacent vertices from the center is 360/n degrees. \n\nWhen choosing three consecutive vertices, like v, v+1, v+2, the angle at v+1 would be determined by the arcs between v, v+1, and v+2. Wait, but in terms of the central angles, maybe we can model this.\n\nAlternatively, for any triplet, the angle at v2 depends on the number of edges between v1 and v2 and between v2 and v3. Let's say in the polygon, moving clockwise, the steps between v1 and v2 is k steps, and between v2 and v3 is m steps. Then, the angle at v2 would be based on these steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle can be calculated using the formula involving the arcs. For example, if from v2, the points v1 and v3 are k and m steps away in either direction, then the angle is (k*angle_step + m*angle_step)/2? Or maybe it's related to the difference between the two arcs.\n\nNo, maybe not exactly. Let me think: the angle at v2 is actually equal to half the measure of the arc that's opposite to it. Because in circle geometry, the inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.\n\nSo if from v2, the arc between v1 and v3 is some measure, then the angle at v2 is half that. So for example, if v1 and v3 are s steps apart, the angle is (s * (360/n)) / 2 = (s*180)/n degrees.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the inscribed angle theorem says that an angle formed by two chords in a circle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. But in this case, the two arcs would be between v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. Or wait, no, maybe the intercepted arc is the one opposite to the angle. So if you have points A, B, C on a circle, the angle at B is half the measure of the arc AC.\n\nSo in the case of the polygon, for three consecutive points, the angle at the middle point is determined by the arc between the first and third points.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the key is to find triplets of points where the arc between v1 and v3 is as close as possible to 2*a degrees. Because the angle at v2 is half that arc's measure.\n\nWait, wait: if the angle is to be as close as possible to 'a' degrees, then the arc should be approximately 2a degrees. So for each possible pair of points (v1, v3), the arc between them determines the angle at v2.\n\nSo the approach could be: for all possible pairs (v1, v3), compute the minimal possible angle at any v2 that lies on the arc between v1 and v3. Wait, but v2 has to be a distinct vertex. So for each possible pair of points, find the possible v2's that are on the arc between them.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible v2, look for points v1 and v3 such that the arc from v1 to v3 via the polygon is as close as possible to 2a degrees.\n\nWait, but how do we represent the positions? Since the polygon is regular and cyclic, perhaps it's easier to represent each vertex as a position on a circle, and then compute the distances between them.\n\nSo here's an idea: for each vertex v2, consider the points that are k steps away in each direction. For each possible k, the angle at v2 would be (k*step + m*step)/something, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps for each possible distance from v2, the angle can be computed.\n\nWait, let's formalize this.\n\nIn a regular n-gon, each vertex is separated by 360/n degrees. So the arc between consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees.\n\nFor a given v2, the points to the left and right can be numbered as v2-1, v2-2, ..., v2-1, v2+1, v2+2, etc., modulo n.\n\nNow, for any two points v1 and v3, the angle at v2 is determined by the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2. According to the inscribed angle theorem, this angle is half the measure of that arc.\n\nSo, for each v2, we can look for pairs (v1, v3) such that the arc length (in steps) between v1 and v3, when moving in the direction away from v2, is as close as possible to 2a degrees. Wait, because the angle is half of that arc.\n\nWait, no. Because the arc that the angle intercepts is the one that's opposite to v2, so the arc length is the number of steps between v1 and v3 when going the long way around the polygon. But perhaps in the case of a regular polygon, the maximum arc between two points is up to (n-1) steps, and the minimal is 1 step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the polygon as a circular arrangement. So for any two points, the minimal arc between them is min(k, n -k), where k is the number of steps between them. But for the inscribed angle, the angle depends on the arc that is opposite to v2, which is the larger arc between v1 and v3.\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Let me clarify.\n\nSuppose v2 is at some position. Then, v1 is x steps clockwise from v2, and v3 is y steps clockwise from v2. Then the angle at v2 is (x + y) * (360/n) / 2 degrees. Because the arc opposite to v2 is the one that goes from v1 to v3 via the side that doesn't include v2. Wait, but perhaps it's the sum of the two arcs on either side of v2.\n\nWait, maybe the angle at v2 is (d * 360/n)/2, where d is the number of steps between v1 and v3 when going around the polygon in the direction that doesn't pass through v2. Or perhaps it's the minimal arc between v1 and v3.\n\nHmm, this part is a bit confusing. Maybe I should look for a formula or a way to compute the angle given three points on a regular polygon.\n\nWait, another approach: for each possible triplet of points, the angle can be calculated based on their positions. But for n up to 105, trying all possible triplets would be O(n^3), which for n=105 is about 1e6, which is manageable, especially since it's Python.\n\nBut wait, n is up to 105, and for each triplet, we need to compute the angle. Hmm, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, but for each triplet, the angle at v2 can be computed as follows:\n\nLet’s assume that the polygon is centered at the origin, and each vertex is on the unit circle. Let’s assign to each vertex v_i an angle θ_v, which is (i-1)*(360/n) degrees. So for i=1, θ is 0 degrees; for i=2, it's 360/n degrees, and so on.\n\nThen, for a triplet v1, v2, v3, the angle at v2 is the angle between vectors v2-v1 and v2-v3. Wait, no, that's the actual geometric angle. But considering the polygon is regular, perhaps there's a way to compute this angle using the differences in their angles.\n\nAlternatively, the angle at v2 can be found using the law of cosines. Because all sides are of equal length (the polygon is regular), the triangle formed by v1, v2, v3 is isoceles. Wait, but not necessarily, because the chord lengths depend on the number of steps between the points.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute the angle using the central angles. Let me think: the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2. Because according to the inscribed angle theorem, the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice the angle subtended at the circumference.\n\nSo for example, if the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is S degrees, then the angle at v2 is S/2 degrees.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a triplet (v1, v2, v3) such that the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is as close as possible to 2a degrees.\n\nBut wait, what's the correct way to compute S? Because in a regular polygon, the total circumference is 360 degrees. So the arc between v1 and v3 can be measured in two ways: the short way and the long way. The inscribed angle depends on which arc is considered.\n\nAh, right. The inscribed angle theorem says that the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. The intercepted arc is the one that is not containing the point where the angle is formed.\n\nSo in our case, for the angle at v2, the intercepted arc is the one between v1 and v3 that doesn't include v2. So the size of that arc is the minimal arc between v1 and v3 if the points are arranged such that v2 is not on that arc. Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, suppose v1 and v3 are on opposite sides of v2. Then the intercepted arc is the one that goes the long way around, not passing through v2. But if they are on the same side, the intercepted arc is the one that goes the short way.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to model this with an example.\n\nTake n=4 (square). The points are 1, 2, 3, 4 in order. Let's choose v2=2.\n\nPossible v1 and v3:\n\nCase 1: v1=1, v3=3. The arc from 1 to 3 not passing through 2 is the long way: 1 →4→3, which is 2 steps (each step is 90 degrees, so 180 degrees). So the angle at v2 is 180/2 = 90 degrees.\n\nCase 2: v1=1, v3=4. The arc not passing through 2 is 1 →4, which is 1 step (90 degrees). Angle is 45 degrees.\n\nWait, so in this case, the angle can vary depending on which v1 and v3 we choose.\n\nSo for each v2, the possible angles are determined by the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2.\n\nAnother example: n=3. All points form an equilateral triangle. Any triplet will form a 60-degree angle. So that's why in the sample input, all possible triplets are acceptable.\n\nSo, back to the problem. For each v2, I need to find v1 and v3 such that the arc between them not passing through v2 is as close as possible to 2a degrees.\n\nBut how to model this? For a given v2, the points v1 and v3 can be any two points in the polygon, but the intercepted arc depends on their positions relative to v2.\n\nWait, perhaps for each v2, we can consider the points to the left and right. Let's imagine that the polygon is arranged in a circle, and for a given v2, the points can be ordered clockwise as v2, v2+1, v2+2, ..., v2-1 (mod n).\n\nFor any v1 and v3, the intercepted arc is the one that doesn't contain v2. So, if both v1 and v3 are on the same side of v2 (say, both are to the right), then the intercepted arc is the one that goes the long way around. Otherwise, if they are on opposite sides, the intercepted arc is the shorter one.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose v2 is at position 0. Points are arranged as 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 in clockwise order.\n\nIf v1 is at position k and v3 is at position m, both on the same side of v2 (say, k < m), then the intercepted arc is the one that wraps around the other side, so the size is (n - (m -k)) * (360/n) degrees.\n\nAlternatively, the intercepted arc is the minimal path between v1 and v3 that doesn't include v2. So if v1 and v3 are on opposite sides of v2, the intercepted arc is the smaller of the two possible paths.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to model the intercepted arc as the minimal path between v1 and v3 that doesn't include v2. No, because if v2 is not on the minimal path, then the intercepted arc is the minimal path. But if v2 is on the minimal path, then the intercepted arc is the longer path.\n\nHmm, perhaps not. Let me think differently. For any two points v1 and v3, the intercepted arc for the angle at v2 is the arc that doesn't pass through v2.\n\nSo, if v2 is somewhere else, the intercepted arc is the one that goes from v1 to v3 without passing through v2.\n\nWait, but in a circle, any two points define two arcs. One is the minor arc (shorter), the other is the major arc (longer). The intercepted arc is the one that doesn't include v2.\n\nSo, for example, if v2 is located such that v1 and v3 are on opposite sides of v2, then the intercepted arc is the minor arc between v1 and v3. If v2 is in between v1 and v3 along the minor arc, then the intercepted arc is the major arc.\n\nSo, the intercepted arc's measure is the minimal of the two possible arcs between v1 and v3, unless v2 is in the minor arc, in which case the intercepted arc is the major arc.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the case.\n\nSo for each pair v1 and v3, the intercepted arc size for v2 is the major arc if v2 is inside the minor arc between v1 and v3, otherwise it's the minor arc.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck on the exact relationship.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each triplet (v1, v2, v3), the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to v2. So, for the angle at v2, the intercepted arc is the one that doesn't contain v2, and its measure is the minimal of the two possible arcs between v1 and v3.\n\nWait, no. Because in the square example earlier, when v1=1, v3=3, and v2=2, the intercepted arc is from 1 to 3 via 4, which is 180 degrees, so the angle is 90 degrees.\n\nBut the minimal arc between 1 and 3 is 2 steps (each 90 degrees, total 180). So in that case, the intercepted arc is the major arc.\n\nWait, so perhaps the intercepted arc is the major arc when v2 is not on the minor arc between v1 and v3, and the minor arc when v2 is on the minor arc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intercepted arc is always the major arc if v2 is not on the minor arc, and the minor arc if v2 is on it.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should find a way to compute the intercepted arc for a given triplet (v1, v2, v3).\n\nAn alternative approach: for any triplet, the intercepted arc is the one that is the sum of the arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3, but going the other way around.\n\nWait, that might make sense. Because, for instance, if v1 is k steps counter-clockwise from v2, and v3 is m steps clockwise from v2, then the intercepted arc would be (k + m) steps in the counter-clockwise direction, which is the sum of those steps.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think: the intercepted arc is the one that doesn't pass through v2. So the intercepted arc is the arc that goes from v1 to v3 via the path that doesn't include v2. So the measure of that arc is the sum of the steps between v1 and v2 (going one way) plus the steps between v2 and v3 (going the same way). Or maybe it's the sum of the other way.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the sum of the steps in the direction that doesn't pass through v2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intercepted arc is the minimal between the two possible arcs between v1 and v3, except when v2 is on one of the arcs, then it's the other.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Maybe I should think of the intercepted arc as the one that is directly opposite to v2. So, for the triplet v1, v2, v3, the intercepted arc is the one that goes from v1 to v3 without passing through v2.\n\nSo, the measure of this arc is the minimal path between v1 and v3 that doesn't include v2. Or the maximal, depending on the situation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the measure is the minimal of the two possible arcs between v1 and v3. Because the intercepted arc is the one that doesn't include v2, which may be the minimal or the maximal, depending on where v2 is.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to model the intercepted arc for a given triplet.\n\nGiven three points on a circle, v1, v2, v3, the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc that is opposite to v2, i.e., the arc that doesn't contain v2. So, the intercepted arc is the one that connects v1 and v3 without passing through v2.\n\nSo, for the triplet (v1, v2, v3), the intercepted arc is the minimal of the two possible arcs between v1 and v3, unless v2 is on that minimal arc, in which case the intercepted arc is the maximal.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think of another example.\n\nSuppose n=6, and the polygon is a hexagon. The points are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\nLet v2 be 2. Let v1 be 4 and v3 be 6.\n\nThe intercepted arc for the angle at 2 is the one that goes from 4 to 6 without passing through 2. That would be the arc from 4 →5 →6, which is 2 steps, each 60 degrees. So the intercepted arc is 120 degrees. The angle at 2 is 60 degrees.\n\nBut the minimal arc between 4 and 6 is 2 steps (60*2=120), and the major arc is 4 steps (240 degrees). So the intercepted arc is 120, which is the minimal. So in this case, the intercepted arc is the minimal.\n\nAnother example: v2 is 2 again, v1 is 5 and v3 is 1.\n\nThe intercepted arc from 5 to 1 without passing through 2 is the major arc: 5 →6 →1, which is 2 steps (120 degrees). The minimal arc between 5 and 1 is 4 steps (240 degrees). So the intercepted arc is 120 degrees.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. Because the minimal arc between 5 and 1 is 4 steps (since 5 to 1 is 4 steps clockwise), which is 240 degrees. The major arc is 2 steps (120 degrees). So the intercepted arc is the major arc, which is 120.\n\nSo in this case, the angle at v2 is 60 degrees.\n\nSo, for this triplet, the intercepted arc is the major arc.\n\nSo, how to determine whether the intercepted arc is the major or minor arc?\n\nIt depends on whether v2 is on the minor arc between v1 and v3. If it is, then the intercepted arc is the major arc. Otherwise, it's the minor arc.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if v2 is on the minor arc between v1 and v3, then the minor arc is the one that passes through v2, so the intercepted arc must be the major one. Otherwise, the minor arc is the intercepted arc.\n\nSo, for a triplet (v1, v2, v3), the intercepted arc is:\n\nif v2 is on the minor arc between v1 and v3 → intercepted arc is the major arc.\n\nelse → intercepted arc is the minor arc.\n\nWait, but how do I determine whether v2 is on the minor arc between v1 and v3?\n\nHmm, perhaps for each triplet, after computing the minor and major arcs between v1 and v3, I can check whether v2 lies on the minor arc. If it does, the intercepted arc is the major. Otherwise, it's the minor.\n\nBut this requires knowing the positions of v1, v2, v3 on the polygon.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intercepted arc is the major arc if the sum of the steps from v1 to v2 and from v2 to v3 (in a certain direction) is greater than half the polygon.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to model the polygon as a circular list, and for each triplet, compute the intercepted arc as follows:\n\nCompute the minimal distance between v1 and v3, which is d. The intercepted arc is the major arc (d > n/2) if v2 is on the minor arc, else the minor arc.\n\nWait, no. Because the intercepted arc is determined by whether v2 is on the minor arc between v1 and v3. So, for each triplet, the intercepted arc is:\n\nintercepted_arc_length = (n - d) if v2 is on the minor arc else d\n\nWhere d is the minimal distance between v1 and v3.\n\nBecause if v2 is on the minor arc, then the intercepted arc is the major one (n-d), else it's the minor (d).\n\nSo, the angle at v2 is (intercepted_arc_length * 360) / (2n) degrees.\n\nWait, because each step is 360/n degrees. So, for a distance of d steps, the arc length is d*(360/n) degrees.\n\nSo, intercepted_arc_length = (d if v2 is not on the minor arc else (n - d)).\n\nThus, the angle is (intercepted_arc_length * 360) / (2n) degrees.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each possible triplet (v1, v2, v3):\n\n1. Compute d, the minimal distance between v1 and v3. (d = min( |v1 - v3|, n - |v1 - v3| )). But since the polygon is circular, it's the minimum of the clockwise and counter-clockwise steps between them.\n\n2. Check if v2 is on the minor arc between v1 and v3. To do this, we can see if v2 is in the range that starts from the lower-numbered point to the higher-numbered point, considering the circular nature.\n\nWait, perhaps for the minor arc between v1 and v3, the points are arranged such that one is lower than the other. So, for example, if v1 is 1 and v3 is 4 in a 5-gon, the minor arc is from 1 to 4, which includes 2 and 3. So, any v2 in this range is on the minor arc.\n\nBut how to handle cases where the minor arc wraps around.\n\nWait, perhaps the condition is that v2 is between the two points when considering their positions in the circular arrangement.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to compute whether the distance from v1 to v2 and v2 to v3 in the minor arc direction sums up to d.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's think: for the minor arc between v1 and v3, the sum of the distances from v1 to v2 and v2 to v3 (in the minor arc direction) should be equal to d.\n\nYes! Because if v2 is on the minor arc between v1 and v3, then the sum of the steps from v1 to v2 and v2 to v3 is equal to the minimal distance d.\n\nOtherwise, it's less than d.\n\nSo, for example, in the square case where v1=1, v3=3, d=2 steps.\n\nv2=2 is on the minor arc from 1 to 3, so the sum is 1 (from 1 to 2) + 1 (from 2 to 3) = 2, which equals d.\n\nIn another example, v1=1, v3=4 in a 5-gon. The minor arc is 3 steps (1 →2 →3 →4). So, if v2 is 2, sum is 1+2=3, which is d. So, v2 is on the minor arc.\n\nWait, but what about v1=5, v3=2 in a 5-gon. The minor arc is from 2 to 5, which is 3 steps (2 →3 →4 →5). So, v2=3 is on the minor arc, sum is 1 (5 to 3) + 2 (3 to 2) = 3, which equals d=3.\n\nSo, the condition is: if (distance(v1, v2) + distance(v2, v3)) == d, then v2 is on the minor arc between v1 and v3.\n\nWait, but how to compute distance in a circular manner.\n\nDistance between a and b is (b - a) mod n, but in a way that gives the minimal steps.\n\nWait, for the purposes of checking, perhaps the sum of the clockwise steps from v1 to v2 and v2 to v3 must be equal to d.\n\nBut perhaps the sum can be more than d if v2 is on the other side. So, maybe the condition is that the sum is less than or equal to d.\n\nWait, perhaps the condition is that the sum of the clockwise steps from v1 to v2 and v2 to v3 is less than or equal to d.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nIf v2 is on the minor arc between v1 and v3, then the sum of the steps from v1 to v2 (clockwise) and v2 to v3 (clockwise) is equal to d.\n\nBecause the minor arc is the shortest path between v1 and v3, so any point on it will have the sum of its distances to v1 and v3 equal to d.\n\nIf v2 is not on the minor arc, then the sum is less than d.\n\nYes! Because if v2 is on the minor arc, then the sum is d. Otherwise, the sum is less than d.\n\nSo, for a given triplet (v1, v2, v3), compute d as the minimal steps between v1 and v3. Then compute the sum of steps from v1 to v2 and from v2 to v3 in a clockwise direction. If this sum equals d, then v2 is on the minor arc, so the intercepted arc is the major arc (n -d). Otherwise, the intercepted arc is d.\n\nSo, the angle is:\n\nangle = (intercepted_arc_length * 360) / (2 * n)\n\nWhich is:\n\nif sum == d:\n    intercepted_arc = n - d\nelse:\n    intercepted_arc = d\n\nangle = intercepted_arc * 180 / n\n\nWait, because 360 degrees correspond to n steps, each step is 360/n degrees. So, an arc of k steps is (k * 360) / n degrees. Half of that is the angle at v2.\n\nSo, the angle is (intercepted_arc * 360) / (2n) degrees.\n\nWhich simplifies to (intercepted_arc * 180) / n degrees.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFor each possible triplet (v1, v2, v3):\n\n1. Compute d = minimal steps between v1 and v3.\n\n   d = min( (v3 - v1) % n, (v1 - v3) % n )\n\n   But wait, in code, perhaps it's better to compute the minimal distance as the minimal of |v1 - v3| and n - |v1 - v3|.\n\n2. Compute the sum of steps from v1 to v2 and v2 to v3 in a clockwise direction. Let's call this sum_s.\n\n   sum_s = (v2 - v1) % n + (v3 - v2) % n\n\n   Wait, but that might not account for the direction correctly.\n\n   Alternatively, for each pair (v1, v2), the clockwise steps between them is (v2 - v1) % n. Similarly for (v2, v3), it's (v3 - v2) % n.\n\n   Sum_s = (v2 - v1) % n + (v3 - v2) % n.\n\n3. If sum_s == d, then the intercepted arc is (n -d) steps. Else, it's d steps.\n\n4. Compute the angle as (intercepted_steps * 180) / n degrees.\n\n5. Find the triplet with the angle closest to 'a', and in case of tie, any is acceptable.\n\nOnce the best triplet is found, output it.\n\nBut wait, this approach is O(n^3), which for n=105 is 105^3 = 1,157,625 operations. That's manageable for Python.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think about optimizing this.\n\nNotice that for a given v2, the best possible triplet is determined by the intercepted arc being as close as possible to 2a degrees. So, for each v2, we can find the best possible v1 and v3 such that the intercepted arc is close to 2a.\n\nWait, but 2a could be more than 180 degrees, which is the maximum possible intercepted arc (since n is up to 105, 2a could be up to 360, but in reality, the intercepted arc is at most 180 degrees because it's the minimal arc if v2 is not on it).\n\nWait, no. Because the intercepted arc can be up to n steps, each 360/n degrees, so the maximum is 360 degrees.\n\nWait, no, the intercepted arc is the major arc when v2 is on the minor arc, which can be up to (n-1) steps, so 360*(n-1)/n degrees.\n\nWait, but 2a can be up to 360, but for n=3, it's 60.\n\nSo, for each v2, we can look for the minimal intercepted arc that is as close as possible to 2a.\n\nSo, for each v2, we can find the optimal intercepted arc, which is either d or (n-d), whichever is closer to 2a.\n\nWait, perhaps for each v2, the best possible intercepted arc is the one that is closest to 2a.\n\nBut since the intercepted arc is either d or (n-d), depending on whether v2 is on the minor arc.\n\nWait, no. Because for a given v2, the intercepted arc can vary based on the choice of v1 and v3.\n\nWait, but for each v2, the minimal intercepted arc is d, and the maximal is n-d, but only when v2 is on the minor arc between v1 and v3.\n\nSo, for each v2, the possible intercepted arcs are in the range [d, n-d], where d is the minimal distance between v1 and v3.\n\nWait, but that's not quite accurate. Because for a fixed v2, varying v1 and v3 can give different d and intercepted arcs.\n\nWait, perhaps for each v2, the minimal possible intercepted arc is d_min = 1 step, and the maximal is (n-1) steps.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because for a fixed v2, the minimal distance between v1 and v3 can be as small as 1 step (when v1 and v3 are adjacent), leading to an intercepted arc of 1 step or (n-1) steps, depending on whether v2 is on the minor arc.\n\nSo, for each v2, the possible intercepted arcs can range from 1 to n-1 steps.\n\nBut this seems too broad.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each v2, the intercepted arc can be any possible value of k steps, where k can be 1, 2, ..., n-1 steps, and for each k, we can find if there exists a triplet (v1, v2, v3) such that the intercepted arc is k steps.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each v2, the optimal intercepted arc is the one that is closest to 2a. So, for each v2, compute the desired intercepted arc (desired_k = 2a), and see if we can find a triplet where the intercepted arc is as close as possible to desired_k.\n\nBut desired_k could be larger than n, so we have to take modulo n.\n\nWait, but 2a can be more than n steps, but since the intercepted arc is at most n steps, perhaps we can compute desired_k as (2a) % n, but considering that for intercepted arc, if the arc is larger than n/2 steps, it's better to take the minor arc instead.\n\nWait, perhaps for each v2, the optimal intercepted arc is either the minor arc (k) or the major arc (n-k), whichever is closer to 2a.\n\nSo, for each v2, compute the best possible intercepted arc as the one that is closest to 2a. Then, for that intercepted arc, find a triplet (v1, v3) such that the intercepted arc is exactly k steps.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, for each v2, the best possible intercepted arc is the one that is closest to 2a, and then find the triplet (v1, v3) that achieves this.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to implement this efficiently.\n\nPerhaps it's easier to proceed with the O(n^3) approach, given that n is small (up to 105). Let's think about implementing that.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Iterate over all possible triplets (v1, v2, v3), where 1 <= v1, v2, v3 <= n, and all are distinct.\n\n- For each triplet:\n\n   a. Compute d = minimal distance between v1 and v3.\n\n   b. Compute sum_s = (v2 - v1) % n + (v3 - v2) % n.\n\n   c. If sum_s == d: intercepted_arc = n - d.\n\n      Else: intercepted_arc = d.\n\n   d. Compute the angle as (intercepted_arc * 180) / n.\n\n   e. Track the triplet with the angle closest to 'a', breaking ties arbitrarily.\n\nOnce the best triplet is found, output it.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the angle should be as close as possible to 'a'. So, for each triplet, compute the absolute difference between the angle and a, and track the triplet with the smallest difference.\n\nIf multiple triplets have the same minimal difference, any can be chosen.\n\nBut with n=105, the O(n^3) approach is feasible.\n\nNow, the challenge is to generate all possible triplets and compute this for each.\n\nBut generating all possible triplets is O(n^3), which for n=105 is about 1 million iterations. In Python, this is acceptable.\n\nSo, the next step is to implement this logic.\n\nBut let's think about how to represent the triplets.\n\nEach triplet is a permutation of three distinct vertices. So, for each v2, we can iterate over all possible v1 and v3, ensuring that v1 != v3 and v1, v2, v3 are all distinct.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, v1, v2, v3 must be distinct. So, in code, for each v2, we'll loop through all possible v1 and v3 where v1 != v3 and v1 != v2 and v3 != v2.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to generate all possible triplets regardless and skip those where v1 == v2 or v2 == v3 or v1 == v3.\n\nAlternatively, in the loops, ensure that v1, v2, v3 are all distinct.\n\nBut for the sake of efficiency, perhaps in the code, for each v2, loop through all possible v1 and v3, and process only when v1 != v3 and v1 != v2 and v3 != v2.\n\nBut with n=105, even if we process all triplets, it's manageable.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nRead n and a.\n\nInitialize best_diff as a very large number, best_triplet as None.\n\nFor v2 in 1..n:\n\n   for v1 in 1..n:\n\n      if v1 == v2: continue\n\n      for v3 in 1..n:\n\n          if v3 == v",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The solution involves iterating through all possible triplets of vertices and calculating the angle for each triplet to determine the closest match.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires finding three vertices (v1, v2, v3) in a regular polygon such that the angle at v2 is closest to 'a'. The angle at v2 is determined by the arcs between v1 and v3 relative to v2.\n2. **Intuition**: In a regular polygon, the angle at any vertex can be calculated using the intercepted arc between the other two vertices. The intercepted arc is either the minor or major arc depending on the position of v2.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Iterate over all possible triplets (v1, v2, v3) ensuring all are distinct.\n   - For each triplet, compute the minimal distance between v1 and v3.\n   - Determine if v2 lies on the minor arc between v1 and v3 to decide whether to use the minor or major arc for the angle calculation.\n   - Calculate the angle and track the triplet with the smallest difference from 'a'.\n4. **Complexity Consideration**: The approach involves checking all possible triplets, which results in O(n^3) complexity.
