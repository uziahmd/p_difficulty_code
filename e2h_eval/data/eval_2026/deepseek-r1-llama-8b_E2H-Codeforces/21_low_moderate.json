The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where Neko found some treasure chests and keys, and needs to open as many chests as possible using the keys. The condition is that a key can unlock a chest only if their numbers add up to an odd number. Hmm, right.\n\nLet me think about the problem step by step. So each chest has an a_i value, and each key has a b_j value. To unlock the i-th chest with a key j, a_i + b_j must be odd. That means one of them is even and the other is odd because even + odd = odd, but two evens or two odds would make an even sum.\n\nSo the first thing I need to do is categorize the chests into two groups: those with even a_i and those with odd a_i. Similarly for the keys. Because each key can only be used once, the strategy is to match as many as possible between even/odd chests and keys.\n\nWait, right. So let's say:\n\n- Let E_c be the number of chests with even a_i.\n- O_c be the number of chests with odd a_i.\n- Similarly, E_k is the number of keys with even b_j.\n- O_k is the number of keys with odd b_j.\n\nNow, for a key to unlock a chest, the key must be of opposite parity. So:\n\n- An even key (E_k) can unlock an odd chest (O_c).\n- An odd key (O_k) can unlock an even chest (E_c).\n\nSo the maximum number of chests we can open is the minimum of E_k and O_c plus the minimum of O_k and E_c. Because each even key can pair with an odd chest, and each odd key can pair with an even chest.\n\nBut wait, wait. No, because each key can be used only once, and each chest too. So the total is the sum of the two minima. So the maximum is min(E_k, O_c) + min(O_k, E_c). But wait, that might not be correct because maybe after using some keys on one type, there are leftovers that could be better used in another way.\n\nNo, no, I think the initial approach is correct. Because each even key can be matched to an odd chest, but the number of such possible pairs is limited by the smaller of E_k and O_c. Similarly, the odd keys can be matched to even chests, but again limited by the smaller of O_k and E_c. Adding these two gives the maximum possible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd a_i (E_c, O_c).\n2. Count the number of even and odd b_j (E_k, O_k).\n3. Compute the sum as min(E_k, O_c) + min(O_k, E_c).\n4. That's the answer.\n\nWait, but what if the sum exceeds the total number of chests? Like, suppose E_k is 5, O_c is 3, O_k is 10, E_c is 2. Then min(E_k, O_c) is 3, min(O_k, E_c) is 2. Sum is 5. But there are 5 chests in total (3+2=5), so that's fine.\n\nBut in cases where E_c and O_c are such that the sum of the two minima is more than n, but that's impossible because each chest is either even or odd, so the sum can't exceed n.\n\nSo for example, if E_k is larger than O_c, but O_k is also larger than E_c, then the sum will be O_c + E_c, which is exactly n. So it's safe.\n\nSo the steps are straightforward. Now, how to implement this in code.\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is given as three lines: first line is n and m. Second line is a list of a_i, third is a list of b_j.\n\nWe need to count how many a_i are even and odd. Similarly for b_j.\n\nIn Python, for each list, loop through each element and count.\n\nThen compute the two minima and sum them.\n\nThat's the answer.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n5 4\n9 14 6 2 11\n8 4 7 20\n\na_i: 9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So E_c = 3 (14,6,2), O_c = 2 (9,11).\n\nb_j: 8 even,4 even,7 odd,20 even. So E_k=3, O_k=1.\n\nSo min(E_k, O_c)= min(3,2)=2.\n\nmin(O_k, E_c)= min(1,3)=1.\n\nSum is 3, which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nn=5,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. Each key can unlock a chest if their numbers add up to an odd number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Categorize Chests and Keys by Parity**: \n   - Separate the chests into two groups based on whether their values are even or odd.\n   - Similarly, separate the keys into two groups based on whether their values are even or odd.\n\n2. **Count Even and Odd Values**:\n   - Count the number of even-valued chests (E_c) and odd-valued chests (O_c).\n   - Count the number of even-valued keys (E_k) and odd-valued keys (O_k).\n\n3. **Calculate Maximum Openable Chests**:\n   - An even key can unlock an odd chest, so the number of such pairs is the minimum of E_k and O_c.\n   - An odd key can unlock an even chest, so the number of such pairs is the minimum of O_k and E_c.\n   - Sum these two minima to get the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Count even and odd in a\neven_a = 0\nodd_a = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_a += 1\n    else:\n        odd_a += 1\n\n# Count even and odd in b\neven_b = 0\nodd_b = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_b += 1\n    else:\n        odd_b += 1\n\nmax_open = min(even_b, odd_a) + min(odd_b, even_a)\nprint(max_open)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Categorization**: By categorizing the chests and keys into even and odd, we can efficiently determine which keys can unlock which chests.\n- **Matching Keys and Chests**: Using the counts of even and odd keys and chests, we determine how many pairs can be formed where the sum of the key and chest values is odd.\n- **Efficiency**: This approach ensures we efficiently count and match without unnecessary complexity, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 100,000 elements.\n\nThis solution efficiently determines the maximum number of chests Neko can open by leveraging parity checks and simple counting operations.",
