After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the number of successful students in a group. A student is considered successful if there's at least one subject where they are the best. Being the best means that no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\nHmm, so for each subject, I need to determine which student has the highest mark. Then, for each student, check if they are the top in any subject.\n\nLet me think about the steps I need to take.\n\nFirst, I'll read the input. The input starts with two integers n and m. Then there are n lines, each representing a student's grades for m subjects. Each line is a string of m characters, each being a digit from 1 to 9.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nEach of the three lines represents a student's marks in three subjects.\n\nFor each subject, I need to find the maximum mark. Then, for each student, see if any of their marks equals that maximum.\n\nWait, but more accurately, for each subject, the student who has the highest mark is the best in that subject. So for each subject, only one student can be the best.\n\nSo my plan is:\n\n1. For each subject, find the maximum mark among all students.\n2. For each student, check if for any of their marks, it is equal to the maximum for that subject.\n3. Count the number of students who have at least one such subject.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read n and m. Then read each of the next n lines as a string.\n\nBut wait, the input may have lines like '3 5\\n...', but no, looking back: no, the first line is n and m, then each of the next n lines is a single string without spaces. So each line represents a row of m digits.\n\nSo for each line, I can process it as a string, and for each character, convert it to an integer.\n\nSo for each student, I'll have a list of m integers.\n\nNext, for each subject (from 0 to m-1), I need to find the maximum mark across all students in that subject.\n\nSo for each subject j, max_mark[j] = max of student[i][j] for all i.\n\nOnce I have these max_marks for each subject, I can then go through each student and check if any of their marks in the subjects equals the corresponding max_mark.\n\nIf yes, the student is successful.\n\nSo the steps in code would be:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read each student's marks into a list of lists (each student is a list of m integers).\n- For each subject j, compute the maximum mark across all students.\n- For each student, check if for any j, their mark in j is equal to max_marks[j].\n- Count the number of such students.\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nLet's think about data structures.\n\nWe can represent each student's marks as a list of integers. So for example, students is a list where each element is a list of m integers.\n\nThen, max_marks is a list of length m, where max_marks[j] is the maximum value in the j-th position across all students.\n\nSo, for each j in 0..m-1:\n\nmax_marks[j] = max( student[i][j] for i in 0..n-1 )\n\nOnce we have max_marks, for each student, loop through their marks and check against each max_marks.\n\nAlternatively, for each student, collect all their marks and see if any of them is present in max_marks.\n\nWait, no. Because for each subject, the max is specific. For example, if in subject 0, the max is 5, and a student's mark in subject 0 is 5, that's good. But in another subject, say subject 1, the max might be 6, and the same student's mark in subject 1 is 6—so that's also good.\n\nSo, for each student, we need to check each subject: is their mark in that subject equal to the max for that subject?\n\nIf any of the subjects satisfies this, the student is successful.\n\nSo, for each student in students:\n\nfor each j in 0..m-1:\n    if student_marks[j] == max_marks[j]:\n        count +=1\n        break\n\nSo that's the approach.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n and m:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, read n lines:\n\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    # line is a string of m characters, each a digit\n    marks = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nThen, compute max_marks:\n\nmax_marks = [0]*m\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = -1\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = students[i][j]\n    max_marks[j] = max_val\n\nWait, but initializing max_val to -1 may not be correct if all students have 1 as the mark. So perhaps better to initialize it to 0 or None.\n\nWait, no. Because the marks are from 1 to 9, so the minimum possible is 1. So initializing max_val to -1 is safe because any mark will be higher than that.\n\nSo after computing max_marks, for each student, check if any of their marks equals the max for that subject.\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in students:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nPrint(count)\n\nWait, that's the plan.\n\nTesting this logic with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n232\n112\n\nParsing each student:\n\nStudent 0: [2,2,3]\n\nStudent 1: [2,3,2]\n\nStudent 2: [1,1,2]\n\nCompute max_marks:\n\nFor subject 0: max is 2 (since all have 2 or lower).\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait:\n\nWait, for subject 0:\n\nstudent 0:2, student1:2, student2:1. Max is 2.\n\nSubject 1:\n\nstudent0:2, student1:3, student2:1. Max is 3.\n\nSubject 2:\n\nstudent0:3, student1:2, student2:2. Max is 3.\n\nSo max_marks = [2,3,3].\n\nNow, check each student.\n\nStudent 0: marks are 2,2,3.\n\nCheck each subject:\n\nsubject 0: 2 == 2 → yes. So count +=1.\n\nStudent 1: marks 2,3,2.\n\nSubject 0: 2 vs 2 → yes. So count +=1.\n\nStudent 2: marks 1,1,2.\n\nCheck each subject:\n\nsubject 0: 1 !=2.\n\nsubject1: 1 !=3.\n\nsubject2: 2 !=3.\n\nSo no. So total count is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n['3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\nAfter parsing, students are:\n\nStudent0: 9,1,7,2,8.\n\nStudent1: 1,1,8,2,8.\n\nStudent2: 1,1,1,1,1.\n\nCompute max_marks for each subject:\n\nsubject0: 9 is the max.\n\nsubject1: max is 1.\n\nsubject2: 8 is the max.\n\nsubject3: 2 is the max.\n\nsubject4: 8 is the max.\n\nSo max_marks = [9,1,8,2,8].\n\nNow, check each student.\n\nStudent0: in subject0, 9 equals max. So yes.\n\nStudent1: in subject1, 1 equals max. So yes.\n\nStudent2: in subject0, 1 <9; subject1, 1=1→ yes. So he is successful.\n\nSo count is 3.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the logic works.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nWhat if n=1? Then the student is automatically successful, since they are the best in all subjects.\n\nWhat if all students have the same marks in all subjects? Then for each subject, the max is same as others, but each student is the best in that subject? Or no?\n\nWait, suppose n=2, m=1.\n\nStudents: 5 and 5.\n\nmax_marks[0] is 5.\n\nEach student's mark is 5, so both are best in subject 0. So both are successful.\n\nSo the count is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2.\n\nStudents:\n\n91\n\n92.\n\nmax_marks are [9,9].\n\nStudent0: 9 and 1.\n\nHe is best in subject 0.\n\nStudent1: 9 and 2.\n\nHe is best in subject 0.\n\nSo both are successful.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2.\n\nStudents:\n\n11\n\n22.\n\nmax_marks: 2,2.\n\nStudent0: 1 in both. So neither is equal to max. So not successful.\n\nStudent1: 2 in both. He is best in both. So he is successful.\n\nThus, count is 1.\n\nNow, thinking about the code.\n\nWait, in the code, for each student, when checking, if any of the m subjects match the max, then count.\n\nSo, what about when a student's mark in multiple subjects is the max? It's still just counted once.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, about reading the input.\n\nWait, the input is given as a single string, but in the sample input, it's shown as ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', ...], which suggests that each line is a separate string. So perhaps the input is provided as multiple lines, each being a student's row.\n\nIn Python, when using standard input, I can read each line with input().strip().\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, what about the case where m=0? Wait, according to the constraints, m is at least 1, right? Because 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. So no, m can't be zero.\n\nSo no problem there.\n\nAnother thing: the way the students are read. Each line is a string of m digits, possibly including leading zeros? But according to the problem statement, each mark is 1-9, so each character is a digit from 1 to 9. So no problem.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nTesting another scenario.\n\nCase where n=1, m=1.\n\nInput: 1 1\\n5\n\nOutput: 1.\n\nYes, because the only student is the best in the only subject.\n\nAnother case: n=4, m=2.\n\nStudents:\n\n91\n\n88\n\n77\n\n66.\n\nMax_marks: 9,8.\n\nStudent0: 9 and 1. So in subject 0, he is best. Successful.\n\nStudent1: 8 and 8. So in subject0, 8 <9. Subject1: 8 ==8. So successful.\n\nStudent2: 7<9, 7<8. Not successful.\n\nStudent3: same as student2.\n\nSo count is 2.\n\nSo code should handle this correctly.\n\nThus, the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead n lines, each as a string, then convert each character to int.\n\nCompute max_marks for each subject.\n\nThen, for each student, check if any subject's mark is the max.\n\nCount those.\n\nFinally, print the count.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nmax_marks = [0] * m\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = -1\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = students[i][j]\n    max_marks[j] = max_val\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in students:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nI think that should do it.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: First, read the number of students `n` and the number of subjects `m`. Then, read each student's marks for all subjects.\n2. **Compute Maximum Marks**: For each subject, determine the highest mark achieved by any student. This gives us an array where each element represents the highest mark for the corresponding subject.\n3. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any of the subjects. If they do, count them as successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nmax_marks = [0] * m\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = -1\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = students[i][j]\n    max_marks[j] = max_val\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in students:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line, converting each character into an integer to form a list of marks for each student.\n2. **Computing Maximum Marks**: For each subject, iterate through all students' marks to find the maximum value. This helps in determining the best mark for each subject.\n3. **Checking Success**: For each student, compare their marks against the maximum marks for each subject. If a student matches the maximum mark in any subject, they are counted as successful.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the number of successful students by leveraging straightforward iteration and comparison, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal for the given constraints.",
