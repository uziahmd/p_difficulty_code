You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vitaly and a graph theory problem. We need to find the minimum number of edges to add to form a simple cycle of odd length (with more than one vertex) and also count the number of ways to do this.\n\nHmm. So the graph is undirected, has n vertices and m edges. No loops or parallel edges. It's not necessarily connected. The task is to compute t and w, where t is the minimal edges to add, and w is the number of ways.\n\nFirst, I think about what constitutes a simple cycle. It's a cycle where each vertex appears exactly once. So for a cycle of length k, it must be that k is at least 3 (since more than one vertex).\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"consisting of more than one vertex\", but in a cycle, each vertex is part of the cycle, so maybe the cycle must have at least 2 nodes? But no, because a cycle with two nodes would require two edges between them, which isn't allowed as per the problem statement. So the cycle must have at least 3 nodes.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in a simple cycle, each node can appear only once. So a cycle of length 3 is a triangle.\n\nSo the goal is to find the smallest number of edges to add so that the graph contains at least one simple cycle of odd length, and then count how many ways this can be done.\n\nLet me think about the approach.\n\nI think the key is to find all possible ways to form such cycles, determine the minimal t, and then count the number of ways to achieve t.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this by looking at the connected components of the graph.\n\nBecause in each connected component, we can try to find if there's a way to form an odd-length cycle by adding edges within that component.\n\nWait, but the added edges can connect different components as well. Or maybe not—because adding edges across components could create a longer cycle, but perhaps the minimal t would come from within a single component.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to consider each connected component and see whether it's possible to form an odd-length cycle by adding some edges. Then, among all components, find the one that requires the least edges, and use that.\n\nBut wait, the added edges can connect any parts of the graph, even across components, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of edges required is determined by the maximum matching or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be broken down into two cases:\n\n1. There exists a connected component that already has an odd-length cycle. In that case, t is zero, and w is the number of such cycles in the graph.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the graph doesn't contain any cycles to begin with. Because if it did, then t would be zero. But no, the initial graph may have cycles, but they are even-length. So the first step is to check whether the graph already has any odd-length cycles.\n\nIf yes, then t is zero, and w is the number of such cycles.\n\nOtherwise, we need to find the minimal number of edges to add to create an odd-length cycle.\n\nSo let's structure the solution:\n\n- First, check if the graph already has any odd-length cycles. If yes, output t=0 and w as the count of such cycles.\n\n- If not, then we need to find the minimal t and w.\n\nSo how do we check for existing odd-length cycles?\n\nWe can perform a depth-first search (DFS) on each connected component, tracking the path length and parity. If during the DFS we find a back edge that forms an odd-length cycle, that component contributes to the count.\n\nOnce we've checked all components, if any have such cycles, we output t=0 and w as the sum of those counts.\n\nIf not, then we need to find how to add edges to form an odd-length cycle.\n\nNow, when the graph doesn't have any odd-length cycles, what's the minimal t?\n\nHmm.\n\nIn that case, the problem reduces to finding a way to create an odd-length cycle by adding as few edges as possible.\n\nWhat's the minimal number of edges needed?\n\nWell, for example, if there's a connected component with at least three vertices, perhaps we can form a triangle by adding one edge.\n\nBut wait, in a tree, adding one edge creates exactly one cycle. The length of that cycle is the distance between the two nodes plus one (since the path between them in the tree is unique). So for a tree, the minimal way is to find two nodes u and v that are in the same connected component and their distance is even. Adding an edge between them would create a cycle of odd length (distance +1).\n\nWait, that's an important point. Because if two nodes are at even distance in a tree, adding an edge between them creates",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of edges to add to a graph to form a simple cycle of odd length and count the number of ways to achieve this. The graph is undirected, has no loops or parallel edges, and may not be connected.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Check for Existing Odd-Length Cycles**: \n   - Perform a depth-first search (DFS) on each connected component of the graph. Track the parity (even or odd) of the path lengths. If a back edge forms an odd-length cycle, record it.\n   - If any such cycles exist, the minimum number of edges to add (`t`) is 0, and the count of such cycles (`w`) is the total number of odd-length cycles found.\n\n2. **Forming New Odd-Length Cycles**:\n   - If no existing odd-length cycles are found, identify the connected components with the highest number of edges. For each component, compute the minimum number of edges needed to form an odd-length cycle.\n   - For each component, calculate the number of ways to form such a cycle by considering all possible pairs of nodes within the component that can form an odd-length cycle when connected.\n\n3. **Determine Minimum and Count**:\n   - Among all components, find the one that requires the fewest edges to form an odd-length cycle. This gives the minimum `t`.\n   - Sum the number of ways across all components to get the total count `w`.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for _ in range(m):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n    \n    # Check if there's already an odd cycle\n    visited = [False] * (n+1)\n    odd_cycles = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            stack = [(i, -1, 0)]  # (node, parent, depth)\n            while stack:\n                node, parent, depth = stack.pop()\n                if visited[node]:\n                    continue\n                visited[node] = True\n                # Check for back edges\n                for neighbor in edges[node]:\n                    if neighbor != parent and ((depth + 1) % 2 == 1):\n                        # Found an odd cycle\n                        odd_cycles += 1\n                # Push children\n                for neighbor in edges[node]:\n                    if not visited[neighbor] and neighbor != parent:\n                        stack.append((neighbor, node, depth + 1))\n    if odd_cycles > 0:\n        print(\"0\", odd_cycles)\n        return\n    \n    # Now, we need to find t and w\n    # Find the connected components and their properties\n    visited = [False] * (n+1)\n    components = []\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            q = deque()\n            q.append(i)\n            visited[i] = True\n            component = []\n            while q:\n                u = q.popleft()\n                component.append(u)\n                for v in edges[u]:\n                    if not visited[v]:\n                        visited[v] = True\n                        q.append(v)\n            components.append(component)\n    \n    max_edges = -1\n    best_t = float('inf')\n    best_w = 0\n    for comp in components:\n        k = len(comp)\n        if k < 2:\n            continue\n        # For each component, find the minimal edges needed to create an odd cycle\n        # and the number of ways to do so\n        # First, check if the component is a tree\n        if k == 1 + m_i:  # where m_i is the number of edges in the component\n            pass\n        # To form an odd cycle, perhaps the component must have at least two vertices with certain distances\n        # Alternatively, think about the maximum matching in the component\n        # But perhaps it's easier to consider the maximum number of edges that can form a cycle\n        # Wait, perhaps another approach is needed\n        # Let's think about the component as a graph.

No, but n is up to 1e5.\n        # Wait, but in practice, the code needs to handle n up to say 1e5. So, a BFS-based approach for each component is needed to compute the distances efficiently.\n\n        # Compute the distances from each node to all others using BFS\n        # But for each component, run BFS once.\n        # Preprocessing: For each component, build a distance matrix using BFS.\n\n        # However, for large n, this is not feasible. So, perhaps we can find a smarter way.\n\n        # Alternative approach: For each component, compute the number of pairs of nodes with even distance.\n        # Since the component is connected, the number of such pairs can be calculated based on the parity of distances.\n\n        # Let's perform BFS for each component and track the parity of each node's distance from a starting node.\n        # Then, for each node, count the number of nodes with the same parity (even or odd). Let's say for a component, x nodes are at even distance from the start, and y at odd.\n        # The number of pairs with even distance is (x choose 2) + (y choose 2), but wait, no. Because two nodes u and v have distance d, which is even if both are at even or both at odd distance from the start.\n        # Wait, no. If the distance between u and v is d, then their distances from the start could be s_u and s_v. Then, d = |s_u - s_v| if they are on the same path, but in a general graph, it's not necessarily the case. So this approach won't work.\n\n        # Hmm, this seems complicated. Perhaps a better approach is to realize that the minimal t is 1 if the graph doesn't have any odd cycles, because adding one edge between two nodes at even distance will form an odd cycle.\n\n        # So, the answer is t=1, and w is the number of such possible edges that can be added across all components.\n\n        # So, for each component, compute the number of pairs of nodes (u, v) such that u and v are in the component, are not already connected by an edge, and their distance is even.\n\n        # Thus, for each component, the number of such pairs is the number of ways to add an edge that forms an odd cycle.\n\n        # So, the minimal t is 1, and the number of ways is the sum across all components of the number of such pairs.\n\n        # So, let's compute for each component the number of pairs (u, v) with even distance, where u < v, and (u, v) is not an existing edge.\n\n        # But how to compute this efficiently?\n\n        # One approach is to use BFS for each component, tracking the parity of each node's distance from a starting node. Then, for each node, count the number of nodes with the same parity. The number of pairs with even distance is the combination of counts for each parity.\n\n        # For example, if in a component, there are x nodes with even distance and y with odd, the number of pairs with even distance is x*(x-1)/2 + y*(y-1)/2.\n\n        # Additionally, we need to subtract the existing edges in the component, as those pairs cannot be used again.\n\n        # So, for each component:\n\n        # 1. Run BFS to determine the parity (even or odd) of each node's distance from a starting node.\n        # 2. Count the number of nodes with even parity (x) and odd parity (y).\n        # 3. The number of possible pairs with even distance is C(x, 2) + C(y, 2).\n        # 4. Subtract the number of existing edges in the component, since each existing edge connects two nodes and thus can't be used again.\n\n        # But wait, step 3 counts all pairs of nodes with even distance. Each such pair can be connected by an edge to form an odd cycle.\n\n        # So, the steps are:\n\n        # For each component:\n        # - BFS to compute parity for each node.\n        # - Compute x and y.\n        # - Compute possible_pairs = (x * (x-1)) // 2 + (y * (y-1)) // 2.\n        # - Subtract the number of edges in the component, since each edge is already present.\n        # - Add this value to the total_ways.\n\n        # So, the minimal t is 1, and the number of ways is the sum of possible_pairs across all components.\n\n        # Now, the question is: How to implement this efficiently.\n\n        # So, the code will proceed as follows:\n\n        # For each component:\n        # - Run BFS to compute the parity for each node.\n        # - Count x and y.\n        # - Compute possible_pairs = C(x,2) + C(y,2).\n        # - Subtract the number of edges in the component (since each edge is already present).\n        # - Add this to total_ways.\n\n        # Finally, output t=1 and w=total_ways.\n\n    # Now, implementing this:\n\n    # For each component, perform BFS and count x and y.\n    # Also, for each component, count the number of edges.\n\n    # So, first, for each component, we need to know the number of edges.\n\n    # We can precompute the number of edges in each component by iterating through the adjacency lists.\n\n    edge_count = defaultdict(int)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        edge_count[i] = 0\n    for a in range(1, n+1):\n        for b in edges[a]:\n            if a < b:\n                edge_count[a] += 1\n                edge_count[b] += 1\n\n    # Wait, no.

No, but n is up to 1e5.\n        # Wait, but in practice, the code needs to handle n up to say 1e5. So, a BFS-based approach for each component is needed to compute the distances efficiently.\n\n        # Compute the distances from each node to all others using BFS\n        # But for each component, run BFS once.\n        # Preprocessing: For each component, build a distance matrix using BFS.\n\n        # However, for large n, this is not feasible. So, perhaps we can find a smarter way.\n\n        # Alternative approach: For each component, compute the number of pairs of nodes with even distance.\n        # Since the component is connected, the number of such pairs can be calculated based on the parity of distances.\n\n        # Let's perform BFS for each component and track the parity of each node's distance from a starting node.\n        # Then, for each node, count the number of nodes with the same parity (even or odd). Let's say for a component, x nodes are at even distance from the start, and y at odd.\n        # The number of pairs with even distance is (x choose 2) + (y choose 2), but wait, no. Because two nodes u and v have distance d, which is even if both are at even or both at odd distance from the start.\n        # Wait, no. If the distance between u and v is d, then their distances from the start could be s_u and s_v. Then, d = |s_u - s_v| if they are on the same path, but in a general graph, it's not necessarily the case. So this approach won't work.\n\n        # Hmm, this seems complicated. Perhaps a better approach is to realize that the minimal t is 1 if the graph doesn't have any odd cycles, because adding one edge between two nodes at even distance will form an odd cycle.\n\n        # So, the answer is t=1, and w is the number of such possible edges that can be added across all components.\n\n        # So, for each component, compute the number of pairs of nodes (u, v) such that u and v are in the component, are not already connected by an edge, and their distance is even.\n\n        # Thus, for each component, the number of such pairs is the number of ways to add an edge that forms an odd cycle.\n\n        # So, the minimal t is 1, and the number of ways is the sum across all components of the number of such pairs.\n\n        # So, let's compute for each component the number of pairs (u, v) with even distance, where u < v, and (u, v) is not an existing edge.\n\n        # But how to compute this efficiently?\n\n        # One approach is to use BFS for each component, tracking the parity of each node's distance from a starting node. Then, for each node, count the number of nodes with the same parity. The number of pairs with even distance is the combination of counts for each parity.\n\n        # For example, if in a component, there are x nodes with even distance and y with odd, the number of pairs with even distance is x*(x-1)/2 + y*(y-1)/2.\n\n        # Additionally, we need to subtract the existing edges in the component, as those pairs cannot be used again.\n\n        # So, for each component:\n\n        # 1. Run BFS to determine the parity (even or odd) of each node's distance from a starting node.\n        # 2. Count the number of nodes with even parity (x) and odd parity (y).\n        # 3. The number of possible pairs with even distance is C(x, 2) + C(y, 2).\n        # 4. Subtract the number of existing edges in the component, since each existing edge connects two nodes and thus can't be used again.\n\n        # But wait, step 3 counts all pairs of nodes with even distance. Each such pair can be connected by an edge to form an odd cycle.\n\n        # So, the steps are:\n\n        # For each component:\n        # - BFS to compute parity for each node.\n        # - Compute x and y.\n        # - Compute possible_pairs = (x * (x-1)) // 2 + (y * (y-1)) // 2.\n        # - Subtract the number of edges in the component, since each edge is already present.\n        # - Add this value to the total_ways.\n\n        # So, the minimal t is 1, and the number of ways is the sum of possible_pairs across all components.\n\n        # Now, the question is: How to implement this efficiently.\n\n        # So, the code will proceed as follows:\n\n        # For each component:\n        # - Run BFS to compute the parity for each node.\n        # - Count x and y.\n        # - Compute possible_pairs = C(x,2) + C(y,2).\n        # - Subtract the number of edges in the component (since each edge is already present).\n        # - Add this to total_ways.\n\n        # Finally, output t=1 and w=total_ways.\n\n    # Now, implementing this:\n\n    # For each component, perform BFS and count x and y.\n    # Also, for each component, count the number of edges.\n\n    # So, first, for each component, we need to know the number of edges.\n\n    # We can precompute the number of edges in each component by iterating through the adjacency lists.\n\n    edge_count = defaultdict(int)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        edge_count[i] = 0\n    for a in range(1, n+1):\n        for b in edges[a]:\n            if a < b:\n                edge_count[a] += 1\n                edge_count[b] += 1\n\n    # Wait, no.
