    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The plate is divided into w rows and h columns, making w*h cells. We have to add k gilded rings. Each ring is like a border around an inner rectangle, and each subsequent ring is 2 cells inward from the previous one. So, for example, the first ring is along the very edge, the second is two cells in, and so on.\n\nHmm, wait, what's the structure of each ring? Let me think. For the i-th ring, it's the border of a rectangle that's (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). So each ring reduces both width and height by 4 each time because we're removing two cells from each side (left, right, top, bottom). That makes sense.\n\nSo, for each ring from 1 to k, I need to compute how many cells are in that ring and sum them all up.\n\nLet me think about how to calculate the number of cells in the i-th ring.\n\nThe formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(width + height) - 4. Because when you count the perimeter, each corner is counted twice if you just do 2*(w + h), so you subtract 4 to account for the four corners being counted once each.\n\nWait, yes. For a rectangle with w rows and h columns, the number of cells in its border is 2*(w + h) - 4. Because each row contributes h cells, but the top and bottom contribute fully, and the middle rows contribute only their ends. So adding all that up gives 2*(w + h) - 4.\n\nBut wait, in our case, each ring is a rectangle that's (current_w) x (current_h), where current_w = w - 4*(i-1), current_h = h - 4*(i-1). So for each i, the ring's perimeter is 2*(current_w + current_h) -4.\n\nBut I need to make sure that current_w and current_h are at least 3, because otherwise, the ring might not exist. Wait no, because the constraints say that k is chosen such that it doesn't exceed the maximum possible rings. So for each i up to k, current_w and current_h will be at least 1, but for the ring to exist, the rectangle must have a perimeter. So as long as the current_w and current_h are >=3, the ring is valid. But wait, for the last ring, when i=k, what happens?\n\nWait, let's see. The problem says that the i-th ring is based on the rectangle of size (w -4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)). So for i=1, it's w x h. For i=2, it's (w-4)x(h-4), and so on until i=k.\n\nBut for the ring to exist, the rectangle must have at least 1 cell on each side. So the minimum possible for the rectangle is 1x1, but in that case, the ring would have 0 cells because 2*(1+1) -4 = 0. Hmm, but according to the problem statement, the input constraints ensure that k is within the allowed limits, so I don't need to worry about invalid cases.\n\nSo, for each i from 1 to k, compute the perimeter as 2*(current_w + current_h) -4, then sum all these perimeters.\n\nWait, but let's test this with the examples given.\n\nFirst example: input is 3 3 1.\n\nSo w=3, h=3, k=1.\n\ncurrent_w = 3, current_h =3.\n\nPerimeter is 2*(3+3)-4 = 12-4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example: 7 9 1.\n\ncurrent_w=7, current_h=9.\n\nPerimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 32-4=28. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2.\n\nFor i=1: 7x9, perimeter 2*(7+9)-4=28.\n\nFor i=2: 7-4=3, 9-4=5. So 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5)-4=16-4=12. So total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample.\n\nGreat, so the approach seems correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read w, h, k.\n\n2. For each i from 1 to k:\n\n   a. Compute current_w = w -4*(i-1)\n\n   b. Compute current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\n   c. Compute perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\n   d. Add to the total.\n\n3. Sum all perimeters and output the result.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input line as three integers.\n\nInitialize total =0.\n\nLoop for i in 1 to k inclusive:\n\n   compute current_w = w -4*(i-1)\n\n   compute current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\n   add to total.\n\nThen print(total).\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nNow, considering edge cases.\n\nWhat if w or h is exactly 3, and k is large enough?\n\nLike w=3, h=3, k=1: already handled.\n\nWhat if k is 0? But according to the problem statement, k is at least 1.\n\nAnother case: w=5, h=5, k=2.\n\ni=1: 5x5: perimeter is 2*(5+5)-4=20-4=16.\n\ni=2: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. Perimeter is 2*(1+1)-4=4-4=0. So total is 16.\n\nIs that correct? Well, the second ring is a 1x1 square, which has no border, so yes.\n\nAnother test case: w=7, h=7, k=2.\n\ni=1: 7x7: perimeter is 2*14 -4=24.\n\ni=2: 3x3: perimeter is 8. So total 32.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all these correctly.\n\nSo the Python code would be something like:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal =0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    cw = w - 4*(i-1)\n    ch = h -4*(i-1)\n    perimeter = 2*(cw + ch) -4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if cw or ch becomes less than 3 for some i? Then the perimeter could be zero or negative? No, because in the problem statement, it's stated that k is within the allowed maximum, so for all i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 1, but perhaps sometimes 1x1, which gives a perimeter of 0.\n\nBut since the problem statement ensures that the input k is valid, the code can proceed without checking.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: 3 3 1 → 8.\n\nSample 2:7 9 1 →28.\n\nSample3:7 9 2 →28+12=40.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother test case:5 5 2.\n\nAs above, 16+0=16.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nI think that's all.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is a border around an inner rectangle, and each subsequent ring is 2 cells inward from the previous one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each ring is a border of a rectangle that is progressively smaller by 4 cells in both width and height for each subsequent ring. The perimeter of each rectangle gives the number of gilded cells for that ring.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For a rectangle with dimensions `w x h`, the perimeter (number of cells) is calculated as `2 * (w + h) - 4` to avoid double-counting the corners.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the current dimensions of the rectangle, calculate its perimeter, and sum these perimeters to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k`.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the current width and height of the rectangle, which are adjusted by subtracting 4 cells for each previous ring.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each current rectangle, compute the perimeter using the formula `2 * (width + height) - 4`.\n4. **Sum Perimeters**: Accumulate the perimeters of all rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n5. **Output Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring that all constraints and edge cases are handled correctly.",
