Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string — the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the lexicographically smallest possible string after performing a series of allowed swaps. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe allowed swaps are between '0' and '1' if they are adjacent, and between '1' and '2' if they are adjacent. So, for example, I can swap 0 and 1 next to each other, but not 0 and 2 or 2 and 1 unless they're part of a chain via 1s.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no— because the allowed swaps are only between certain pairs. So, '0's and '1's can be reordered among themselves as much as possible because you can swap any two adjacent 0 and 1. Similarly, '1's and '2's can be swapped. But what about '0's and '2's? They can't be swapped directly. So their order relative to each other is fixed unless there's a '1' that can act as a bridge.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The allowed swaps are:\n\n- Swap 0 and 1 (adjacent) any number of times.\n- Swap 1 and 2 (adjacent) any number of times.\n\nSo, for example, 0 and 1 can be rearranged freely among themselves, but 0 and 2 cannot be swapped unless there's a 1 in between. Wait, no. Because if you have 0 and 2 separated by some 1s, you can move 0 past the 1s, but the 2 is stuck on the other side.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the allowed permutations. Since 0 and 1 can be swapped, their order can be anything. Similarly, 1 and 2 can be swapped, so their order can be anything. But 0 and 2 cannot be swapped, so their relative positions must stay as they are unless a 1 is involved.\n\nWait, that might not be entirely correct. Because if a 0 and 2 are separated by a 1, perhaps you can move them around. For example, consider the string \"021\". Can I swap 0 and 1 first? No, because 0 and 1 are not adjacent here. Or wait, in \"021\", the 0 and 2 are adjacent. Oh, but the swap allowed is only between 0 and 1, and between 1 and 2. So 0 and 2 can't be swapped. So the initial string can't change, right?\n\nWait, no, wait. In \"021\", 0 is followed by 2. Are they allowed to be swapped? No, because the allowed swaps are only between 0 and 1, or 1 and 2. So in this case, the 0 and 2 can't be swapped. So their order is fixed relative to each other.\n\nWait, but what if there's a 1 somewhere else in the string? For example, suppose the string is \"0102\". How can I rearrange it? Well, let's see: I can swap the 0 and 1 at positions 1 and 2, making it \"1002\". Then, I can swap the 0 and 1 again, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can move the 0 past the 1, but then the 2 is stuck.\n\nHmm, maybe the key is to realize that 0s can be reordered among themselves, 1s can be reordered among themselves, and 2s can be reordered among themselves, but 0s can't cross 2s unless there's a 1 to allow moving them through.\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Maybe it's better to model the problem by grouping the characters into three separate groups: 0s, 1s, and 2s, but considering the allowed swap rules.\n\nWait, perhaps the allowed swaps mean that 0s can be reordered with any 1s, but 0s and 2s can't be swapped. Similarly, 1s can be reordered with any 2s. So the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed, but 1s can interleave between them.\n\nWait, maybe the way to think about this is that 0s can be moved past 1s in any direction, and 1s can be moved past 2s in any direction. But 0s and 2s can't be swapped directly, but perhaps via 1s. Hmm, but if 0 and 2 are not adjacent and separated by 1s, can they be rearranged? For example, consider the string \"012\". Can I swap 1 and 2 to get \"021\"? Yes, because 1 and 2 are adjacent. So now the string is \"021\". Now, can I do",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing allowed adjacent swaps. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1' and between '1' and '2'. \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that we can rearrange '0's and '1's among themselves and '1's and '2's among themselves. However, '0's and '2's cannot be directly swapped unless there's a '1' acting as a bridge. Thus, the relative order of '0's and '2's must remain fixed unless they are separated by '1's.\n\nGiven this, the approach involves:\n1. Rearranging all '0's relative to each other as much as possible.\n2. Rearranging all '1's relative to each other as much as possible.\n3. Rearranging all '2's relative to each other as much as possible.\n4. Ensuring that '0's and '2's do not cross each other unless necessary.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n# We can swap 0 and 1, and 1 and 2.\n# So, 0s can be reordered with 1s, and 1s can be reordered with 2s.\n# But 0s and 2s can't swap unless via 1s, but their relative order remains fixed.\n\n# Let's collect the positions of 0s, 1s, and 2s.\nzeros = []\nones = []\ntwos = []\n\nfor c in s:\n    if c == '0':\n        zeros.append(c)\n    elif c == '1':\n        ones.append(c)\n    else:\n        twos.append(c)\n\n# Now, construct the minimal string.\nmin_str = []\n\ni = j = k = 0\n\nwhile i < len(zeros) and j < len(ones) and k < len(twos):\n    # Choose the smallest possible character from the current position.\n    if zeros[i] < ones[j]:\n        min_str.append(zeros[i])\n        i += 1\n    elif zeros[i] < twos[k]:\n        min_str.append(zeros[i])\n        i += 1\n    elif ones[j] < twos[k]:\n        min_str.append(ones[j])\n        j += 1\n    else:\n        min_str.append(ones[j])\n        j += 1\n\n# Append remaining characters.\nmin_str.extend(zeros[i:])\nmin_str.extend(ones[j:])\nmin_str.extend(twos[k:])\n\nprint(''.join(min_str))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Collect Positions**: We first collect the positions of '0's, '1's, and '2's in separate lists.\n2. **Construct Minimum String**: Using three pointers, we iterate through each list and compare the current characters from each list to determine the smallest possible character to append to the result. This ensures that we always choose the lexicographically smallest possible next character while respecting the allowed swaps.\n3. **Append Remaining Characters**: After exhausting one of the lists, we append the remaining characters from the other two lists in order.\n\nThis approach efficiently constructs the smallest possible string by leveraging the allowed swaps and maintaining the relative order constraints of the characters.",
