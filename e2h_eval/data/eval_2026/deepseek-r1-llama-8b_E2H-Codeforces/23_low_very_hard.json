            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles, and I have to find the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form at least one mentsu. A mentsu can be a triplet (three same tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\nHmm, let's break it down. First, I need to process each of the three input strings. Each string represents a tile, like '1s', '2m', etc. So, I'll probably represent each tile as a tuple of (number, suit), which I can convert into integers for easier handling.\n\nSo, step one: parse the input into three tiles. Then, for each possible way of adding tiles (from any of the four suits, but I think we can focus on the existing suits plus others, but maybe it's better to consider all possibilities), compute the minimal draws needed.\n\nWait, but since she can add any tiles, including duplicates, perhaps the best approach is to generate all possible sets of tiles after adding 0, 1, 2, or 3 more tiles, and for each set, check if any subset of four tiles forms a mentsu. Because after adding up to three tiles, the total becomes 4,5,6,7 tiles. Wait, wait—no, the initial count is three. She adds x tiles, so the total is 3+x. For that total, we need to see if there exists a mentsu among the tiles.\n\nWait, no: the problem says that the player must have at least one mentsu in her hand. So, after adding some tiles, the combined set of tiles must contain at least one mentsu. So, for each possible x (0,1,2,3), check whether adding x tiles (any combination) allows the current set to have a mentsu.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimal x such that this is possible.\n\nBut considering that x can be 0,1,2,3, perhaps the approach is to check for each x from 0 upwards, and return the smallest x for which it's possible.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each of the three initial tiles, parse them into (num, suit). Let's say they are t1, t2, t3.\n\n2. Generate all possible sets S that consist of the original three tiles plus any number of additional tiles (up to 3, because beyond that, adding more would not be optimal; since x is minimal, we can stop at x=3).\n\n3. For each such S, check if it contains any mentsu (triplet or sequence).\n\n4. The minimal x is the minimal size of S minus 3, where S is the earliest possible that has a mentsu.\n\nWait, but how do I efficiently generate all possible S? Because adding any tiles could lead to a mentsu, but the space is manageable since x can be up to 3, so the total possibilities are 4^3 = 64 possibilities for each tile addition.\n\nWait, no: the added tiles can be any of the 9*3=27 possible tiles. But when adding multiple tiles, it's possible that they are duplicates of existing ones. So, for example, adding two '1m's would not contribute much unless it's part of a triplet.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible x (0,1,2,3), we can consider all possible combinations of x tiles (possibly with repeats, but for efficiency, perhaps we can consider all possible tiles, but only once each, since adding more copies doesn't help beyond that).\n\nWait, but when considering all possible x=0,1,2,3, the maximum number of added tiles per scenario is 3, so the total possibilities for each x are manageable.\n\nWait, but for x=0, it's just the original three tiles. For x=1, it's 3 + 1 =4, so the possible added tiles are 27 options. But since adding multiple copies is allowed, but for x=1, the added tile is one, so 27 possibilities. For x=2, 27^2 possibilities, but that's 729, which is manageable. For x=3, 27^3 is 19683, which is a bit large but manageable for a computer.\n\nWait, but that's 19683 cases for x=3, and for each case, we have to check if any subset of 4 tiles forms a mentsu. Hmm, but perhaps we can optimize.\n\nWait, perhaps the better approach is to precompute all possible ways of adding tiles, and for each new set, check if any mentsu exists within it.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\nLoop over x from 0 to 3 (inclusive):\n\n   For each possible combination of x tiles (allowing duplicates, since you can add any tiles,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) with her current tiles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Parse Input**: Convert each of the three input strings into tuples representing the number and suit of each tile.\n2. **Generate Possible Sets**: For each possible number of additional tiles (from 0 to 3), generate all possible combinations of those tiles.\n3. **Check for Mentsu**: For each generated set of tiles, check if it contains any triplet or sequence. The first x (starting from 0) for which this condition is met will be our answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef parse_tiles(tiles):\n    return [(int(t[0]), t[1]) for t in tiles]\n\ndef has_mentsu(tiles):\n    counts = {}\n    sequences = set()\n    \n    for num, suit in tiles:\n        counts[(num, suit)] = counts.get((num, suit), 0) + 1\n        if counts[(num, suit)] >= 3:\n            return True\n        \n        for s in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n            if s == suit:\n                current_num = num\n                while True:\n                    key = (current_num, s)\n                    if key in counts:\n                        if counts[key] >= 1:\n                            return True\n                    current_num += 1\n                    if current_num > 9:\n                        break\n    \n    for group in itertools.combinations(sorted(set([t[0] for t in tiles])), 3):\n        sorted_group = sorted(group)\n        for i in range(len(sorted_group)-1):\n            if sorted_group[i+1] - sorted_group[i] != 1:\n                break\n        else:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ntiles = input().split()\noriginal = parse_tiles(tiles)\n\nfor x in range(4):\n    added = []\n    for _ in range(x):\n        for num in range(1, 10):\n            for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n                added.append((num, suit))\n    all_tiles = original + added\n    if has_mentsu(all_tiles):\n        print(x)\n        exit()\nprint(4)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Parsing Tiles**: The `parse_tiles` function converts each input string into a tuple of integers, where the first element is the number and the second is the suit.\n2. **Checking for Mentsu**: The `has_mentsu` function checks if the given set of tiles contains a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n3. **Generating Sets**: For each possible number of additional tiles (0 to 3), we generate all possible combinations of those tiles.\n4. **Finding Minimum Draws**: We check each generated set starting from the smallest number of draws (0) up to 3. The first x for which a mentsu is found is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum number of additional tiles needed by leveraging combinations and checking for the presence of a mentsu in each possible set.",
