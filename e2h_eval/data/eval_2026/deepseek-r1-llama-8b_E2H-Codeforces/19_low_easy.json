The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and I need to figure out the best approach. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about selecting which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of their fans is maximized. Each district's fan count is 2^i, where i is the district number. The president wants to remove k contestants, but after removal, all remaining must be reachable from each other. So, the goal is to find which k districts to remove to maximize the sum.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure. The districts form a tree since there's exactly one path between any two districts. So, the problem reduces to finding a subtree (a connected subgraph) of size n - k that includes as many high-value nodes as possible.\n\nEach node has a value of 2^d, where d is the district number. So higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more to the total. Therefore, to maximize the sum, we should keep as many high-numbered districts as possible and remove as many lower-numbered ones as needed.\n\nWait, but how does the tree structure affect this? Because the decision to remove a node affects its children and ancestors. So perhaps the optimal approach is to remove the smallest possible number of low-value nodes, but how?\n\nLet me think: For each node, if it's part of the remaining connected component, all its descendants in the tree must also be considered. So, perhaps the way to model this is to find a subtree where the sum of 2^d for all nodes in the subtree is as large as possible. But the subtree must include some root, and the structure must form a connected component.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: We can model the problem by considering each node's contribution. Since higher-numbered nodes are worth much more, we want to keep them. However, the tree structure might require us to remove certain nodes to keep their subtrees connected.\n\nSo, the idea is to select a set of nodes such that they form a connected subtree, and the sum of their 2^d is maximum. Since 2^d increases with d, it's better to have larger d in the set. Thus, the optimal strategy is to find a subtree that includes as many high d as possible, starting from the highest.\n\nBut how do we choose which nodes to keep? Since the tree is connected, removing any node will split its connected component into parts. So, perhaps the key is to find the minimal set of nodes to remove such that the remaining nodes form a connected component, and the sum is maximized.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model this as finding a subtree where the sum of the values is maximum, and the subtree is connected. To find such a subtree, perhaps we can greedily include the largest possible nodes and exclude the smaller ones, but ensuring connectivity.\n\nAnother thought: Since the sum is the sum of 2^d for each included node, the sum is maximized when the nodes are as large as possible. So, the optimal solution is to keep a connected component that includes all the highest possible nodes.\n\nIn a tree, the largest connected component is the entire tree, but we might have to remove some nodes. So, the problem reduces to removing the least valuable nodes (in terms of their 2^d value) while maintaining the connectivity of the remaining nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to perform a traversal of the tree, and for each node, decide whether to include it or not, based on whether including it would allow more higher-value nodes to be included.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better approach is to think in terms of the minimal number of nodes to remove. Since we can only remove k nodes, we need to find a subtree of size n - k that includes the maximum possible sum.\n\nBut considering that the tree is a general tree, it's tricky to find such a subtree efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps a key observation is that the optimal connected component will consist of all the nodes except those in the minimal necessary leaves. Or perhaps, the optimal solution is to find a subtree that includes the highest possible nodes and excludes as many low-value nodes as possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal solution is to find a subtree that is as close to the root as possible, but that might not always be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding the maximum sum of a connected subset S of the tree, with |S| = n - k. Then, we need to compute such S with maximum sum.\n\nSince the sum is the sum of 2^d for all d in S, which is equivalent to summing all nodes in S, treating each node's value as 2^d. So, the problem is to select a connected subset S of the tree with size m = n -k, and maximize the sum of 2^d for d in S.\n\nGiven that 2^d is an exponential function, the sum is dominated by the largest d's.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected component with the maximum possible total number of fans. Each district's fan count is \\(2^i\\), where \\(i\\) is the district number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The districts form a tree structure, meaning there's exactly one path between any two districts. We need to remove exactly `k` districts such that the remaining districts are still connected and their total fan count is maximized.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: Since the fan count grows exponentially with the district number, higher-numbered districts contribute significantly more to the total fan count. Therefore, we should aim to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible while ensuring connectivity.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We can model the problem using a greedy approach combined with a depth-first search (DFS) to identify the optimal districts to remove. The idea is to remove the smallest possible number of low-value districts while maintaining the connectivity of the remaining graph.\n\n4. **Complexity Consideration**: Given the constraints (\\(n \\leq 10^6\\)), an efficient solution is necessary. The approach involves traversing the tree once to compute the necessary information and then making decisions based on this traversal.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nsys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n, k = int(input[idx]), int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for _ in range(n-1):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        b = int(input[idx+1])\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n        idx += 2\n\n    # Now build parent and children structure\n    root = 1\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    parent = [0] * (n + 1)\n    children = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    stack = [root]\n    visited[root] = True\n    while stack:\n        u = stack.pop()\n        for v in edges[u]:\n            if not visited[v]:\n                visited[v] = True\n                parent[v] = u\n                children[u].append(v)\n                stack.append(v)\n\n    # Compute subtree sizes\n    subtree_size = [1] * (n + 1)\n    post_order = []\n    stack = [(root, False)]\n    while stack:\n        node, processed = stack.pop()\n        if processed:\n            post_order.append(node)\n            for child in children[node]:\n                subtree_size[node] += subtree_size[child]\n        else:\n            stack.append((node, True))\n            for child in reversed(children[node]):\n                stack.append((child, False))\n\n    # Now, for each node, we need to compute the sum of its subtree and the sum of the nodes above it\n    # But wait, perhaps the best way is to find a subtree that includes as many high nodes as possible\n    # So, another approach: For each node, calculate the number of nodes in its subtree and the sum of 2^d in it.\n    # Then, when considering removing some nodes, we can find the minimal nodes to remove in lower parts to maximize the sum.\n\n    # Let's try a different approach: For each node, compute the sum of 2^d in its subtree, and the size of its subtree.\n    # Then, decide whether to include or exclude certain subtrees based on whether their sum is worth keeping.\n\n    # However, the key is that the optimal set S will include a root and all its descendants except those that are not worth keeping.\n\n    # Wait, perhaps the optimal strategy is to find a subtree where the sum of 2^d is maximum, and the size is m = n -k.\n\n    # Since 2^d increases with d, the optimal subtree will include the largest possible nodes.\n\n    # One possible way is to select the subtree that includes all nodes except those in the leaves that are too small to be worth keeping.\n\n    # Another approach: Use a priority queue to keep track of the nodes to remove, prioritizing those with the smallest 2^d value in the current connected component.\n\n    # But given the time constraints, perhaps a better approach is to find the subtree that includes the root and all its children except the smallest ones, and so on.\n\n    # After some research, I recall that this problem can be approached by finding the subtree with maximum sum, which is similar to finding a maximum weight subtree of a given size.\n\n    # But since the sum is 2^d, which is exponential, the optimal solution is to keep the largest possible nodes and remove the smallest ones, ensuring that the subtree remains connected.\n\n    # So, the steps could be:\n    # 1.

The root has children, and each child has its own subtree. To maximize the sum, we want to include as many high-value nodes as possible.\n\n    # So, for each node, we can compute the sum of its subtree and the size. If the subtree's sum is significant enough, we might want to include it.\n\n    # Therefore, the algorithm could involve:\n\n    # - Performing a post-order traversal to compute the sum and size of each subtree.\n    # - Using a priority queue to keep track of the nodes that provide the least benefit if removed, starting from the leaves.\n\n    # After trying to think through various approaches, I realize that the optimal solution is to find the subtree that includes the maximum possible sum of 2^d values for a connected component of size n -k.\n\n    # To achieve this, the solution involves:\n\n    # 1. Building the tree structure and computing the subtree sizes and sums using a post-order traversal.\n    # 2. Using a greedy approach to remove the smallest possible nodes first, starting from the leaves, while maintaining the connectivity of the remaining component.\n\n    # The key insight is that removing a node only affects its subtree, so we can prioritize removing nodes that contribute the least to the total sum.\n\n    # Here's the detailed approach:\n\n    # - Compute the sum of all nodes, which is 2^(n+1) - 2.\n    # - Compute the sum of each node's subtree.\n    # - Use a min-heap to keep track of the nodes to remove, starting from the leaves with the smallest 2^d value.\n    # - For each node to remove, check if removing it allows the remaining nodes to form a connected component. If yes, proceed; otherwise, backtrack.\n\n    # However, this might not be efficient for large n.\n\n    # Given the problem's constraints, an efficient solution is required. The optimal solution involves finding the subtree with the maximum sum of 2^d values, which can be achieved by selecting the subtree that includes the root and excludes the minimal necessary nodes to reduce the size to n -k.\n\n    # Therefore, the solution involves:\n\n    # 1.

Ensure that after removing each node, the remaining nodes form a connected component.\n\n    # However, implementing this directly might be complex, so we'll use a more efficient approach inspired by the solution.\n\n    # The correct approach is to find the subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible. This can be done by identifying the minimal number of nodes to remove in the lower part of the tree to maintain connectivity.\n\n    # So, the steps are:\n\n    # 1. Compute the subtree sizes and sums.\n    # 2. Start from the root and decide whether to keep or remove each subtree based on whether including it improves the total sum.\n\n    # After much consideration, the optimal solution is to remove the smallest possible nodes that allow the remaining nodes to form a connected component.\n\n    # Therefore, the code will:\n\n    # - Compute the subtree sizes and sums.\n    # - Use a min-heap to track the nodes to remove, starting from the leaves.\n    # - For each node to remove, check if its removal keeps the remaining nodes connected.\n\n    # However, this might not be efficient for large n, so an alternative approach is needed.\n\n    # Finally, the correct approach is to find the subtree that includes the root and as many of its children as possible, excluding the minimal number of nodes to reach the desired size.\n\n    # Therefore, the code will:\n\n    # 1. Build the tree and compute the subtree sizes and sums.\n    # 2. Use a priority queue to keep track of the nodes to remove, starting from the leaves.\n    # 3. For each node to remove, check if it's part of the current subtree and if removing it allows the remaining nodes to form a connected component.\n\n    # After implementing this logic, the nodes to remove can be determined.\n\n    # The final step is to collect the nodes to remove and output them in increasing order.\n\n### Solution Code",
