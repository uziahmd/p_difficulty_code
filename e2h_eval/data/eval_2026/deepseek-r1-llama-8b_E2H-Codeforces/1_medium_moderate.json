    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I calculate the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. Let's see what the problem says.\n\nThe plate is w rows by h columns. We have k rings to gild. Each ring is a border around an inner rectangle that's getting smaller each time. The first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, and so on. Each ring has a width of one cell.\n\nHmm, so for each ring i (starting from 1), the dimensions of the rectangle are (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h -4*(i-1)). Wait, because each ring reduces both the width and height by 4? Because for each ring, we're adding a border of 1 cell on each side, but since it's two sides, it's 2 cells each for width and height. So each ring effectively subtracts 2 from each dimension, but since each ring is built on top of the previous, maybe it's cumulative?\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. For the first ring, the rectangle is w x h. The ring is all the cells around the perimeter. So for a rectangle with w rows and h columns, the perimeter has 2*(w + h - 2) cells because you have top and bottom rows, and left and right columns, but subtracting the four corners which are counted twice.\n\nSo for each ring, we can compute the perimeter as 2*(current_w + current_h - 2). But wait, each ring is a layer that's two cells inward from the previous. So the first ring is the outermost, then the next ring is inside that, two cells in, etc.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the way the problem describes it: the i-th ring is based on the inner rectangle of size (w -4(i-1)) x (h -4(i-1)). Oh, right. So for each ring, the rectangle is reduced by 4*(i-1) in each dimension. So for i=1, it's w x h. For i=2, it's w-4*1 x h-4*1, and so on.\n\nSo for each ring i, the perimeter is 2*( (w -4*(i-1)) + (h -4*(i-1)) ) - 2. Because the formula for perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width - 2). Because when you have a rectangle of l rows and w columns, the perimeter is 2*(l + w - 2). For example, 3x3 has 8 cells on the perimeter.\n\nSo the approach is: for each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the rectangle at that ring, and sum them all up.\n\nBut wait, what if after some rings, the rectangle becomes too small? Like, for example, if the initial w or h is not large enough to support k rings. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it doesn't exceed the maximum possible rings. So we don't have to worry about that.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize total_gilded = 0.\n\n2. For each ring i from 1 to k:\n\n   a. Compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   b. Compute current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   c. Compute the perimeter as 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   d. Add this to total_gilded.\n\n3. Output the total_gilded.\n\nWait, let's test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example: Input is 3 3 1.\n\nFor i=1: current_w=3, current_h=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example: 7 9 1.\n\ni=1: 7+9-2 =14 *2=28. Correct.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2.\n\ni=1: 7+9-2=14 → 28.\n\ni=2: 7-4=3, 9-4=5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5-2)=2*6=12. So total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: say w=5, h=5, k=2.\n\ni=1: 5x5 → perimeter 2*(5+5-2)=16.\n\ni=2: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. Perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 0. Wait, that's zero? Because 1x1 is just one cell, so the perimeter is zero? That makes sense because the inner rectangle is 1x1, so no ring around it.\n\nWait, but wait: for i=2, the rectangle is 5-4=1, so 1x1. So the ring is the perimeter of that, which is 0. So the total would be 16+0=16.\n\nIs that correct? Because the second ring is the innermost possible.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nAnother test case: w=7, h=7, k=2.\n\ni=1: perimeter is 2*(7+7-2)=48.\n\ni=2: 7-4=3, 7-4=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2)=8. So total is 48+8=56.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the plan is to loop through each ring, compute the perimeter, and sum.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input as three integers: w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nFor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   total += perimeter\n\nPrint total.\n\nWait, but what if current_w or current_h becomes less than or equal to 0? According to the input constraints, k is such that it's within the maximum possible, so we don't have to handle cases where current_w or current_h become <=0.\n\nBecause the constraints say that k is <= floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w,h) is 3, (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nSo let's write the code.\n\nRead the input line as a string, split into w, h, k.\n\nIn Python, something like:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    cw = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    ch = h -4*(i-1)\n\n    perim = 2 * (cw + ch - 2)\n\n    total += perim\n\nprint(total)\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: 3 3 1 → 8.\n\nSample 2:7 9 1 → 28.\n\nSample 3:7 9 2 → 28+12=40.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: w=5, h=5, k=2 → 16+0=16.\n\nYes.\n\nLooks correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is a border around an inner rectangle that gets progressively smaller.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Understanding**: The plate is divided into a grid of `w` rows and `h` columns. We need to add `k` gilded rings, each forming a border around an inner rectangle. The first ring is along the outer edge, the second ring is two cells inward, and so on.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring `i`, the dimensions of the rectangle are reduced by 4*(i-1) in both width and height. The perimeter of a rectangle with dimensions `current_w` and `current_h` is given by `2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)`.\n3. **Summing Perimeters**: For each of the `k` rings, compute the perimeter of the respective rectangle and sum these perimeters to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k`.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the current dimensions of the rectangle by subtracting 4*(i-1) from both `w` and `h`.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each ring, compute the perimeter using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle.\n4. **Sum Perimeters**: Accumulate the perimeters of all rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n5. **Output Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring that all edge cases are handled correctly as per the problem constraints.",
