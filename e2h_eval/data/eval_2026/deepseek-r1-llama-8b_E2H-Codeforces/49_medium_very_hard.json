They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if it's possible to assign a number of mushrooms to each lawn such that all the given roads' GCD and LCM constraints are satisfied. And if it's possible, I have to output any valid assignment.\n\nHmm, let's think about the problem. Each edge between two lawns u and v gives us a pair (g, l), which is the GCD and LCM of the mushrooms on u and v. So, for each such edge, the numbers mu and mv must satisfy g = gcd(mu, mv) and l = lcm(mu, mv).\n\nWait, but wait a minute—what's the relationship between GCD and LCM? Oh right, for any two numbers a and b, gcd(a,b) * lcm(a,b) = a*b. So for each edge, g * l must equal mu * mv. That's an important point.\n\nSo for each edge, mu * mv = g * l. That seems like a key equation we can use.\n\nNow, the problem is to assign values to each node such that all these equations are satisfied, considering only the known edges (m edges). The nodes not connected by any known edges can have any value as long as it's consistent with the given constraints.\n\nThis feels like a graph problem where we can model the constraints and find possible assignments. Maybe using a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure with some additional information attached to each set.\n\nWait, but how do we model the constraints between nodes? Because each constraint relates two variables (mu and mv) in a multiplicative way. So perhaps each connected component can be represented with some variables that track possible products or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, considering that mu and mv are related via their GCD and LCM, maybe we can represent each node's value in terms of a common variable. For example, suppose for two nodes u and v, the edge gives g = gcd(mu, mv) and l = lcm(mu, mv). Then, mu = g * a, mv = g * b, where a and b are coprime integers. Also, l = g * a * b. Because the LCM of a and b is a*b since they are coprime.\n\nSo, for each edge, mu and mv can be written as multiples of their GCD. This might help in setting up ratios between the nodes.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's say for each node u, we assign a value x_u. Then, for each edge (u, v, g, l), the following must hold:\n\ng = gcd(x_u, x_v)\nl = lcm(x_u, x_v)\nWhich implies that x_u * x_v = g * l.\n\nBut also, since g is the GCD, x_u and x_v must be multiples of g. Let me write x_u = g * a and x_v = g * b, where a and b are coprime. Then, the LCM would be g*a*b. So, l must equal g*a*b.\n\nTherefore, for each edge, after factoring out the GCD g, the product of a and b must be l/g. Since a and b are coprime, their product is l/g. So, a and b must be factors of l/g and coprime.\n\nThis suggests that for each edge, the pair (a, b) must be a coprime pair whose product is (l/g). So, the possible pairs are the factorizations of (l/g) into two coprime factors.\n\nWait, but l and g are given. So, for each edge, we can compute k = l / g. Then, a and b must be positive integers such that a * b = k and gcd(a, b) = 1.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding for each edge a pair (a, b) such that a * b = k and gcd(a, b) = 1. Once these a and b are determined, x_u = g * a and x_v = g * b.\n\nBut then, how do we combine these constraints across multiple edges?\n\nThis seems complicated because the variables are interdependent. So, perhaps the approach is to model the graph as a system of equations where each edge represents a ratio between two variables.\n\nWait, maybe we can model this using a system where each connected component has variables that are proportional to certain factors. For example, in a connected component, all variables can be expressed as multiples of a base variable, with ratios determined by the edges.\n\nAnother thought: since x_u and x_v are related by x_u * x_v = g*l, perhaps each edge can be represented as a relation x_u / x_v = r, where r is some rational number. But I'm not sure how that would work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a bipartite graph where each edge enforces a certain ratio between two variables. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about each connected component. Suppose we have a tree of nodes connected by edges. For each edge, the variables are constrained in a certain way. So, perhaps the way to model this is using a Union-Find data structure where each set keeps track of a product or ratio that allows us to assign variables consistently.\n\nBut how to represent the product or ratio in a way that can be combined when merging sets.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. For each connected component, we can assign a value to one node, and express all other nodes' values relative to it. For example, if node A is in a connected component and we assign x_A = v, then other nodes B, C, etc., will have x_B = v * a, x_C = v * b, etc., based on the constraints.\n\nWait, but the problem is that each edge imposes a specific relationship between two nodes, which may impose constraints on the possible values of a and b. So, perhaps we can represent each connected component as a collection of variables, where each variable is a multiple of a base variable, and the ratios are determined by the edges.\n\nSo, for each connected component, we can choose a root node and express all other nodes in terms of the root's value. Then, the constraints from the edges must be satisfied in terms of these expressions.\n\nLet's formalize this. Suppose we have a connected component, and for each node u, we have x_u = k * c_u, where k is some constant, and c_u is a value that depends on the component's structure. Then, for each edge (u, v, g, l), the following must hold:\n\ng = gcd(k * c_u, k * c_v) = k * gcd(c_u, c_v)\nl = lcm(k * c_u, k * c_v) = k * lcm(c_u, c_v)\n\nBut wait, the given g and l are the GCD and LCM of x_u and x_v. So, according to the earlier reasoning, g = k * gcd(c_u, c_v), and l = k * lcm(c_u, c_v). But this must hold for the given g and l.\n\nWait, but the given g and l are the actual GCD and LCM of x_u and x_v. So, the above equations must hold for them.\n\nSo, let's see: given that x_u = k * c_u and x_v = k * c_v, then:\n\ngcd(x_u, x_v) = k * gcd(c_u, c_v) = g\nlcm(x_u, x_v) = k * lcm(c_u, c_v) = l\n\nWhich implies that:\n\nk * gcd(c_u, c_v) = g\nk * lcm(c_u, c_v) = l\n\nAnd since for any two numbers a and b, gcd(a,b)*lcm(a,b) = a*b, we have:\n\ng * l = (k * gcd(c_u, c_v)) * (k * lcm(c_u, c_v)) ) = k² * (gcd(c_u,c_v) * lcm(c_u,c_v)) ) = k² * c_u * c_v.\n\nBut since x_u * x_v = (k c_u) * (k c_v) = k² c_u c_v, which equals g * l. So, this is consistent.\n\nBut from the first two equations, we can get:\n\nFrom the first equation: k = g / d, where d = gcd(c_u, c_v).\n\nFrom the second equation: k = l / m, where m = lcm(c_u, c_v).\n\nSo, substituting k from the first equation into the second:\n\n(l / m) = g / d => l * d = g * m.\n\nBut since d = gcd(c_u, c_v) and m = lcm(c_u, c_v), we know that d * m = c_u * c_v.\n\nSo, l * d = g * m → l * (d) = g * (d * m / d) → l * d = g * m → which is always true because d * m = c_u * c_v, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, because for c_u and c_v, d = gcd(c_u, c_v), m = lcm(c_u, c_v) = (c_u * c_v)/d.\n\nSo, substituting m into l*d = g*m:\n\nl * d = g * (c_u c_v)/d → multiply both sides by d:\n\nl d² = g c_u c_v.\n\nBut from the previous step, x_u x_v = g l = k² c_u c_v = (g² / d²) c_u c_v.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let's think differently.\n\nGiven that x_u = k c_u and x_v = k c_v, and for the edge (u, v, g, l):\n\ng = gcd(x_u, x_v) = k gcd(c_u, c_v)\nl = lcm(x_u, x_v) = k lcm(c_u, c_v)\n\nWe can solve for k:\n\nk = g / d, where d = gcd(c_u, c_v)\nAlso, k = l / m, where m = lcm(c_u, c_v)\n\nSo, equating the two expressions for k:\n\ng / d = l / m → g m = l d.\n\nBut since m = (c_u c_v)/d, substituting:\n\ng (c_u c_v/d) = l d → g c_u c_v = l d².\n\nHmm. Not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each edge imposes a ratio between the variables of the two nodes. For example, for edge (u, v), the variables x_u and x_v must satisfy x_u / x_v = a/b, where a and b are coprimes. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a system of equations where each edge contributes a multiplicative factor. For example, in a connected component, each node's value can be expressed as a multiple of a base value, and the edges impose constraints on these multiples.\n\nSo, the idea is to represent each connected component with a variable that represents the base value. For example, in a connected component, we can assign a variable 'k' and express each node's value as k multiplied by some factor.\n\nWait, that's similar to the earlier idea. So, for each connected component, we can choose a root node, say node r, and assign x_r = k. Then, for each other node u in the component, x_u = k * a_u, where a_u is some factor determined by the constraints along the path from r to u.\n\nSo, each edge (u, v) adds a constraint between a_u and a_v.\n\nWait, yes. So, for each edge (u, v, g, l), we have:\n\nx_u = k a_u\nx_v = k a_v\n\nSo, the GCD and LCM conditions become:\n\ng = gcd(k a_u, k a_v) = k * gcd(a_u, a_v)\nl = lcm(k a_u, k a_v) = k * lcm(a_u, a_v)\n\nBut since g and l are given, we can express this as:\n\nk * d = g\nk * m = l\n\nwhere d = gcd(a_u, a_v), m = lcm(a_u, a_v).\n\nSo, from these two equations, we can find that:\n\nd = g / k\nm = l / k\n\nBut since d and m are dependent on a_u and a_v, and since d must divide m (because m = (a_u a_v)/d), we have:\n\n(g/k) must divide (l /k)\n\nWhich implies that g divides l, because (g/k) | (l/k) → g | l.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Because for example, if k is 2, then (g/k) could be 3 and (l/k) could be 6, which is divisible by 3. But if k is 1, then g must divide l.\n\nWait, perhaps the condition is that g must divide l. Because:\n\nSince d = gcd(a_u, a_v) and m = lcm(a_u, a_v), we have d * m = a_u a_v.\n\nBut from the earlier equations:\n\nd = g / k\nm = l / k\n\nSo, (g/k) * (l/k) = a_u a_v.\n\nBut a_u a_v is equal to (x_u /k) * (x_v /k) = (x_u x_v)/(k^2). But from the edge, x_u x_v = g l, so substituting:\n\n(g l) / k² = (g/k) * (l/k) → which is correct.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps the key is that for each edge, the given g must divide l, because otherwise, the equations wouldn't make sense.\n\nWait, but looking at the sample input:\n\nIn the second test case:\n\nThe edges are:\n3 2\n3 2 1 2\n3 1\n1 10\n\nWait, wait, the input is a bit unclear. Let me check the sample input again.\n\nSample Input:\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\nWait, probably, each line is a road, which is four numbers: u, v, g, l.\n\nSo for the first sample in the sample input, perhaps it's:\n\nn=4, m=3.\n\nWait, no, the first line is '1 0', which is n=1 and m=0. So the output is \"YES\\n1\".\n\nThen the next sample is n=2, m=1: the road connects 2 and 1, with g=1, l=2.\n\nSo x1 * x2 = 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nAlso, gcd(x1, x2)=1, lcm=2.\n\nPossible solutions: x1=1, x2=2; or x1=2, x2=1.\n\nBut in the sample output, it's \"YES\\n1 3\". Wait, no, the sample shows that each case is a separate test case.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that each of the following m lines is a road. So the first line after n and m is a road, etc.\n\nSo for the first test case:\n\nInput is ['1 0'], meaning n=1, m=0. So there's nothing to process. So the output is YES and 1.\n\nSecond test case: input is ['2 1\\n1 2 1 3'] → n=2, m=1. The road connects 1 and 2, with g=1, l=3.\n\nSo x1 * x2 = 1*3=3.\n\nAlso, gcd(x1, x2) =1, lcm=3.\n\nSo possible options: x1=1, x2=3.\n\nOr x1=3, x2=1. Or any other pair where their product is 3 and gcd is 1. Wait, 3 is prime, so the possible pairs are (1,3) and (3,1). So the output is \"YES\\n1 3\".\n\nThird test case: ['3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10'] → n=3, m=2.\n\nWait, no, each line is a road. So the third test case's input is two roads:\n\nFirst road: 3 2, g=1, l=2.\n\nSecond road: 3 1, g=1, l=10.\n\nSo we have roads between 3-2 (g=1, l=2) and 3-1 (g=1, l=10).\n\nSo what's the possible assignment?\n\nLet me see:\n\nFor the first road: x3 and x2 must satisfy x3*x2 = 1*2=2.\n\nAnd gcd(x3, x2) =1, lcm=2.\n\nPossible pairs: (1,2) or (2,1).\n\nFor the second road: x3 and x1 must satisfy x3*x1 =1*10=10.\n\nAnd gcd(x3, x1)=1, lcm=10.\n\nPossible pairs: (1,10), (10,1), (2,5), (5,2), etc., but wait, wait, no: because x3 is already determined by the first road. So let's see.\n\nIf in the first road, x3 is 1 and x2 is 2.\n\nThen, in the second road: x3=1, so x1 must satisfy 1 * x1 = 10 → x1=10.\n\nCheck the constraints: gcd(1,10)=1, lcm=10. Yes, that's valid.\n\nSo the assignment is x1=10, x2=2, x3=1.\n\nAlternatively, if x3=2, x2=1.\n\nThen, for the second road, x3=2. So 2 * x1 =10 → x1=5.\n\nCheck: gcd(2,5)=1, lcm=10. Yes.\n\nSo two possible assignments: [10, 2, 1] or [5,1,2]. But the sample output shows \"5 1 2\" as a valid solution.\n\nSo the output is \"YES\\n5 1 2\".\n\nFourth test case: ['2 1\\n1 2 3 7'] → n=2, m=1. Road between 1 and 2, g=2, l=7.\n\nSo x1 and x2 must satisfy x1*x2=2*7=14.\n\nAlso, gcd(x1, x2)=2, lcm=7.\n\nBut wait, if the GCD is 2, then both x1 and x2 must be multiples of 2. So let's write x1=2a, x2=2b.\n\nThen, their product is 4ab =14 → ab=3.5, which is not possible since a and b are integers. So no solution exists. Hence, the output is \"NO\".\n\nSo the sample outputs make sense.\n\nNow, how do I model this for a general case.\n\nIdea: For each connected component, assign a variable k, and express each node's value as k multiplied by a coefficient. These coefficients must satisfy the constraints imposed by the edges.\n\nSo, for each connected component, we can choose a root node, and assign a value to it (say, k * c_root), and then for each edge in the component, we can express the relationships between the coefficients of the nodes.\n\nEach edge (u, v, g, l) gives us:\n\ng = gcd(k c_u, k c_v) = k * gcd(c_u, c_v)\nl = lcm(k c_u, k c_v) = k * lcm(c_u, c_v)\n\nSo, from these, we can express c_u and c_v in terms of k.\n\nBut since c_u and c_v must be integers, and their product is (l/g) * k²/(g²) ? Wait, not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: for each edge, the ratio between c_u and c_v must be such that their product times k squared equals g*l.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, x_u = k c_u, x_v = k c_v.\n\nThen, x_u x_v = k² c_u c_v = g l → c_u c_v = (g l)/k².\n\nBut also, from the edge, we have:\n\ng = k gcd(c_u, c_v)\nl = k lcm(c_u, c_v)\n\nSo, combining these:\n\nl = k * (c_u c_v) / gcd(c_u, c_v)\n\nBecause lcm(a, b) = a*b / gcd(a, b).\n\nSo, substituting c_u c_v from the previous equation:\n\nl = k * ( (g l)/(k²) ) / (g / k )\n\nSimplify:\n\nl = k * ( (g l)/(k²) ) / (g/k) \n= k * ( (g l) / (k²) ) * (k/g)\n= k * (l / k )\n= l\n\nSo the equation holds, which is consistent.\n\nBut this doesn't give us new information.\n\nSo, the key is to model the relationships between c_u and c_v for each edge.\n\nEach edge imposes that c_u and c_v must be such that:\n\ngcd(c_u, c_v) = g / k\nlcm(c_u, c_v) = l / k\n\nBut since c_u and c_v are coprime with each other in some way? Or not necessarily.\n\nWait, no, c_u and c_v can have a gcd of d = g/k. So, d is a divisor of both c_u and c_v.\n\nThus, c_u = d * a, c_v = d * b, where a and b are coprime.\n\nThen, the lcm(c_u, c_v) is d a b.\n\nSo, from the edge, we have:\n\nd = g / k\nd a b = l / k\n\nSubstituting d:\n\n(g/k) a b = l/k → g a b = l.\n\nSo, a b = l / g.\n\nBut since a and b are coprimes, l/g must be equal to a product of two coprimes.\n\nSo, for each edge, the value of k must be a divisor of g, because d = g/k must be an integer.\n\nMoreover, l must be a multiple of g, because l = k * d a b, and d is g/k. So, l must be a multiple of g.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, in the fourth test case, the edge has g=2, l=7. 7 is not a multiple of 2, so the equation l must be a multiple of g is not satisfied. Hence, no solution exists.\n\nSo, this gives us a preliminary check: for each edge, if l is not a multiple of g, then it's impossible. So, in that case, we can immediately output NO.\n\nWait, but wait: in the fourth test case, l=7 and g=2. 7 mod 2 is 1, so it's not a multiple. So, the condition fails, hence no solution.\n\nSo, our first step is to check for all edges whether l is a multiple of g. If any edge fails this, output is NO.\n\nOtherwise, for each edge, we can compute k_edge = g / d, where d is a divisor of g. Wait, no: d is g / k, so k must be a divisor of g.\n\nSo, for each edge, k must be a divisor of g.\n\nBut k is a global variable for the connected component, right? Because in a connected component, all edges must agree on the same k.\n\nWait, no. Because the connected component may have different edges, but each edge's k must be the same for the entire component.\n\nWait, because the value of k is the same for all nodes in the component. So, for all edges in a connected component, the value of k must be the same.\n\nSo, for all edges in a connected component, k must be a divisor of g, and also satisfy that for each edge, a and b are coprimes whose product is l/g.\n\nWait, but l/g may not be an integer if l is not a multiple of g. Which brings us back to the initial check.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Check for all edges whether l is a multiple of g. If any edge fails this, output NO.\n\n2. For each connected component, determine a value of k such that for all edges in the component, k is a divisor of g, and l/g can be factored into two coprimes a and b.\n\n3. Assign the values to the nodes based on the chosen k and the coprime factors.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: For each connected component, we can model the relationships as a system of equations where each edge contributes a multiplicative constraint.\n\nEach edge (u, v) gives us x_u * x_v = g * l, where g and l are given.\n\nSo, for each connected component, the product of the x's for any cycle must be equal to the product of the corresponding g*l terms around the cycle.\n\nWait, this sounds familiar to checking bipartiteness or cycles in a graph, but here it's more about multiplicative constraints.\n\nAlternatively, the connected component can be considered as a system where the product of x's for each edge must be equal to g*l.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a graph where each node's x is represented as a variable, and each edge contributes a multiplicative equation x_u * x_v = g * l.\n\nBut solving such a system for arbitrary graphs is challenging.\n\nBut perhaps, for each connected component, we can assign variables in such a way that the product constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet me think about the connected component as a tree. For trees, we can assign variables in a way that satisfies all constraints.\n\nBut for cycles, we have to ensure that the product constraints are consistent around the cycle.\n\nSo, for each cycle in the component, the product of x_u for the nodes in the cycle must equal the product of (g * l) for the edges in the cycle.\n\nBut since the product is a multiplicative function, this can cause issues if the product is not equal.\n\nSo, for example, if a cycle has edges (u1, u2, g1, l1), (u2, u3, g2, l2), ..., (un, u1, gn, ln), then the product of x_u1 * x_u2 * ... * x_un must equal (g1 l1) * (g2 l2) * ... * (gn ln).\n\nBut the left side is x_u1 * x_u2 * ... * x_un, and the right side is the product of the g l for each edge.\n\nBut if the connected component has a cycle, the product of the x's around the cycle must equal the product of the (g l) terms around the cycle.\n\nBut x's are variables, so unless the product of the (g l) terms is 1, which is unlikely, this may not hold.\n\nWait, but the product of the x's around the cycle is the product of the variables, which is a single value. The product of the (g l) terms is a fixed value. So, for the system to be consistent, this product must be equal.\n\nSo, for each cycle, the product of (g l) around the cycle must be a perfect square? Or perhaps not, but it's a necessary condition.\n\nWait, perhaps not. For example, consider a triangle with three edges. The product of x1 x2 x3 must equal (g1 l1) (g2 l2) (g3 l3). So, the product x1 x2 x3 is fixed by the edges, but x1, x2, x3 are variables subject to other constraints as well.\n\nThis suggests that the connected components must form a bipartition where the product constraints are satisfied, which may lead to certain conditions on the g and l values.\n\nBut this seems complicated. So, perhaps the approach is to model each connected component as a directed graph with edges representing the multiplicative constraints, and then check for consistency.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative idea: Since x_u * x_v = g * l for each edge, perhaps each connected component can be assigned a value k, and then for each node, x_u = k * c_u, where c_u is determined by the constraints.\n\nThen, for each edge, c_u * c_v = (g l) / k².\n\nBut this requires that (g l) must be divisible by k².\n\nWait, but k is the same for the entire component.\n\nSo, for each connected component:\n\n- Choose a root node, assign x_root = k.\n- For each other node u in the component, x_u = k * c_u.\n- Then, for each edge (u, v), c_u * c_v = (g * l) / k².\n\nBut this implies that for each edge, (g * l) must be divisible by k². So, k must be a divisor of sqrt(g l).\n\nBut since k is an integer, this is only possible if g l is a perfect square, and k is a divisor of the square root.\n\nWait, no. For example, if g=2, l=8, then g l=16, which is a perfect square. So k could be 2, 4, etc. But wait, 16 is 4², so sqrt is 4. So k can be any divisor of 4.\n\nWait, but for each edge in the component, the same k must be used.\n\nSo, for each connected component, we need to find a k such that for all edges in the component, (g * l) is divisible by k², and that the product c_u * c_v equals (g l)/(k²) for each edge.\n\nBut how do we find such a k?\n\nThis seems tricky.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model each connected component as a graph where each edge represents a ratio constraint between two variables. We can model this using a Union-Find structure with additional information about the ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps each node can have a parent, and a variable representing the ratio between the node's value and its parent's value. Then, when merging two sets, we can check if the constraints are compatible.\n\nYes! That's an interesting idea.\n\nSo, the Union-Find structure will track for each node u, the value x_u in terms of x_parent(u). For example, x_u = x_p * a, where p is the parent of u, and a is a rational number.\n\nWhen processing each edge, we can check if the two nodes are already in the same set. If they are, we can compute the expected ratio based on their current a values and the edge's constraints. If they are not, we merge the sets and adjust the a values accordingly.\n\nWait, but the a values are ratios, which can be fractions. So, perhaps we can represent them as numerator and denominator in reduced form.\n\nBut how to handle this.\n\nLet me think: When processing an edge (u, v, g, l), we have x_u x_v = g l.\n\nBut x_u is equal to x_p * a, where p is the parent of u. Similarly, x_v = x_q * b, where q is the parent of v.\n\nAssuming that u and v are in different sets, we can merge them and set up the a and b values such that the equation x_u x_v = g l is satisfied.\n\nBut since x_u = a * x_p, x_v = b * x_q, the equation becomes a x_p * b x_q = g l.\n\nBut x_p and x_q are in different sets, so they may be assigned in terms of other variables.\n\nWait, but this might not be sufficient because when you have multiple edges, the constraints must be consistent.\n\nSo, the steps for each edge:\n\n1. Find the roots of u and v.\n\n2. If roots are the same, compute the expected x_u x_v based on the current a and b values. Then, check if this equals g l. If not, the constraints are conflicting, so output NO.\n\n3. If roots are different, merge the sets and adjust the a and b values so that x_u x_v = g l.\n\nBut how to represent a and b.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node u, x_u is equal to x_root * a, where a is a rational number in reduced form.\n\nSo, for each node u, a_u is stored as a fraction (numerator, denominator), such that x_u = x_root * (num/den).\n\nThen, for each edge (u, v, g, l), we have:\n\nx_u * x_v = g l → x_root * a_u * x_root * a_v = g l → (x_root)^2 * (a_u a_v) = g l.\n\nBut x_root is a variable, so perhaps we can set x_root to be the square root of (g l) divided by (a_u a_v), but that seems circular.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when merging two sets, we can express the a values in terms of the new root.\n\nWait, perhaps when merging u's set into v's set, we can set x_u = x_v * a, where a is determined by the edge.\n\nSo, for edge (u, v, g, l), when u and v are in different sets:\n\nAfter merging, the new root is v. So, x_u = x_v * a.\n\nBut x_u is also equal to x_p * a_u (from the parent structure).\n\nSo, x_p * a_u = x_v * a → x_p = x_v * a / a_u.\n\nBut x_p was previously in a different set, so perhaps this introduces new variables.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to represent each node's value in terms of a root, and track the product of the a's along the path from the root.\n\nSo, for each node u, x_u = k * a_u, where k is the value of the root, and a_u is a product of fractions representing the path from the root to u.\n\nWhen merging two sets, we can compute what the new a_u should be for the merged set.\n\nSo, let's formalize this:\n\nEach node u has:\n\nx_u = k * a_u\n\nWhere k is the value of the root of u's set.\n\na_u is a rational number, which represents the product of the ratios along the path from the root to u.\n\nWhen processing an edge (u, v, g, l):\n\nWe have x_u * x_v = g l → (k a_u) * (k a_v) = g l → k² a_u a_v = g l.\n\nSo, during the processing, for each edge, we can compute what a_u a_v must be.\n\nIf u and v are in the same set:\n\nCompute a_u and a_v (based on their current a values). Then, check if k² a_u a_v equals g l. If not, the constraints are conflicting.\n\nIf u and v are in different sets:\n\nWe can merge the two sets. Let's say u's root is u_root, with value x_u_root = k1 * a1, and v's root is v_root, with x_v_root = k2 * a2.\n\nAfter merging, one of the roots becomes the parent of the other. Let's say we make u_root the parent of v_root.\n\nThen, x_v = x_u_root * a, where a is determined by the edge.\n\nFrom x_u * x_v = g l → (k1 a1) * (k2 a2 * a) = g l.\n\nBut also, when merging, x_v is now part of u's set, so x_v = x_u_root * a.\n\nBut we also have x_v_root = x_u_root * a.\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\n(k1 a1) * (k2 a2 a) = g l → k1 k2 a1 a2 a = g l.\n\nBut what about the a's for the merged sets?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to express a in terms of the edge.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to compute the ratio a such that x_v = x_u * a.\n\nBut x_v is also equal to x_v_root * a_v.\n\nSo:\n\nx_u * a = x_v_root * a_v → (k1 a1) a = (k2 a2) a_v.\n\nBut we need to express a_v in terms of a.\n\nWait, perhaps during the union operation, we can set a_v to a certain value based on the edge.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to model the a's as the product of the ratios along the path from the root.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here.\n\nPerhaps it's time to look for similar problems or algorithms.\n\nUpon reflection, this problem resembles the problem of checking if a graph can be bipartitioned, but with multiplicative constraints. It's similar to building a Union-Find structure where each edge imposes a ratio between two nodes.\n\nThis suggests that the Union-Find structure can be augmented to track the product of ratios between nodes and their roots.\n\nIn this augmented DSU, each node u has a parent p[u], and a value a[u], which represents x_u / x_p.\n\nSo, x_u = x_p * a[u].\n\nWhen processing an edge (u, v, g, l), we perform the following steps:\n\n1. Find the root of u and the root of v.\n\n2. If they are the same, compute x_u * x_v = (x_root * a_u) * (x_root * a_v) = x_root² * a_u a_v. This must equal g * l. So, if x_root² * a_u a_v != g*l, then it's impossible, return NO.\n\n3. If they are different, we need to merge the two sets. To do this, we can attach one root to the other and adjust the a values accordingly.\n\nLet's say we merge v's root into u's root. Then, x_v = x_u_root * a_v, but x_v is also equal to x_u * a_u. Wait, no, x_v is in a different set, so perhaps this needs more careful handling.\n\nAlternatively, when merging u's root into v",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to assign a number of mushrooms to each lawn such that all given road constraints (GCD and LCM) are satisfied. If possible, we should output any valid assignment; otherwise, we should output \"NO\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the problem as a graph where each node is a lawn and each edge represents a road with given GCD and LCM constraints.\n2. **Union-Find Data Structure**: Use a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) structure to manage connected components of the graph. Each node will keep track of its parent and a value representing the ratio of mushrooms from the root of its set.\n3. **Check Feasibility**: For each edge, check if the given LCM is a multiple of GCD. If not, output \"NO\".\n4. **Process Edges**: For each edge, use the Union-Find structure to either merge sets or check for consistency. If merging sets leads to conflicting constraints, output \"NO\".\n5. **Assign Values**: After processing all edges, assign values to each node based on the constraints derived from the Union-Find structure.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom math import gcd\nsys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n\ndef input():\n    return sys.stdin.read()\n\nclass DSU:\n    def __init__(self, n):\n        self.parent = list(range(n+1))\n        self.rank = [0]*(n+1)\n        self.a = [1]*(n+1)  # a[u] is x_u / x_parent(u)\n    \n    def find(self, u):\n        if self.parent[u] != u:\n            orig_parent = self.parent[u]\n            self.parent[u] = self.find(self.parent[u])\n            self.a[u] *= self.a[orig_parent]\n        return self.parent[u]\n    \n    def union(self, u, v, g, l):\n        root_u = self.find(u)\n        root_v = self.find(v)\n        \n        if root_u == root_v:\n            product = self.a[u] * self.a[v]\n            k_squared = self.rank[root_u]\n            if k_squared * product != g * l:\n                return False\n            return True\n        \n        if self.rank[root_u] > self.rank[root_v]:\n            root_u, root_v = root_v, root_u\n            u, v = v, u\n        \n        self.parent[root_u] = root_v\n        self.a[root_u] = (g * l) // (self.rank[root_v] * self.a[u] * self.a[v])\n        self.rank[root_v] += self.rank[root_u]\n        return True\n\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(data[idx])\n    m = int(data[idx+1])\n    idx +=2\n    \n    dsu = DSU(n)\n    possible = True\n    edges = []\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u = int(data[idx])\n        v = int(data[idx+1])\n        g = int(data[idx+2])\n        l = int(data[idx+3])\n        idx +=4\n        edges.append((u, v, g, l))\n        if l % g != 0:\n            possible = False\n    \n    if not possible:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    \n    for u, v, g, l in edges:\n        if not dsu.union(u, v, g, l):\n            possible = False\n            break\n    \n    if not possible:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    \n    root = dsu.find(1)\n    k = 1\n    a = [0]*(n+1)\n    visited = [False]*(n+1)\n    stack = [1]\n    visited[1] = True\n    while stack:\n        u = stack.pop()\n        a[u] = dsu.a[u]\n        for edge in edges:\n            if edge[0] == u or edge[1] == u:\n                other = edge[0] if edge[1] == u else edge[1]\n                if not visited[other]:\n                    visited[other] = True\n                    stack.append(other)\n    \n    res = [0]*(n+1)\n    res[root] = 1\n    for u in range(1, n+1):\n        if u == root:\n            res[u] = 1\n        else:\n            res[u] = res[dsu.find(u)] * dsu.a[u]\n    \n    print(\"YES\")\n    print(' '.join(map(str, res[1:n+1])))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Union-Find Structure**: This helps manage connected components and efficiently merge sets while tracking the ratio of mushroom counts between nodes.\n- **Feasibility Check**: Ensures that for each edge, the LCM is a multiple of the GCD, a necessary condition for a valid solution.\n- **Edge Processing**: Each edge either merges two sets or checks for consistency.
