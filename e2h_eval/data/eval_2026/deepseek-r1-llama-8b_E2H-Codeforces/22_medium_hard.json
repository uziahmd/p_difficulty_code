After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the number of successful students in a group. A student is considered successful if there's at least one subject where they are the best. Being the best means that no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\nHmm, so for each subject, I need to determine which student has the maximum mark. Then, for each student, check if they are the maximum in any subject.\n\nLet me think about the steps I need to take.\n\nFirst, I'll read the input. The input starts with two integers n and m. Then there are n lines, each representing a student's grades for m subjects. Each line is a string of m characters, each being a digit from 1 to 9.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nEach of the three lines represents a student's marks in three subjects.\n\nI need to process each subject across all students to find the best mark for each subject.\n\nWait, but each subject is a position in the string. For example, for the first subject, it's the first character of each student's string; for the second subject, the second character, etc.\n\nSo for each subject j (from 0 to m-1), I need to look at all students' j-th character, find the maximum, and note which student(s) have that maximum.\n\nThen, for each student, check if they have at least one such maximum in any subject.\n\nThe approach I can take is:\n\n1. For each subject, find the maximum mark among all students.\n2. For each subject, record which students have that maximum.\n3. For each student, count how many subjects they are the maximum in. If at least one, they are successful.\n\nBut how do I efficiently compute this?\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read the next n lines as the student's grade strings.\n- For each subject j (0-based index):\n   - Collect all the j-th characters from each student.\n   - Find the maximum value in this collection.\n   - Create a list of students who have this maximum in subject j.\n- Then, for each student, check if they are present in any of these lists (for any subject). Count how many such students exist.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, let's think about data structures. For each subject j, we can store a set of student indices (like 0-based) who have the maximum in that subject.\n\nThen, for each student, we can iterate through all the subjects and see if they are in any of the sets for that subject.\n\nWait, but storing a set for each subject might be memory-efficient. But since n and m are up to 100, it's manageable.\n\nLet me think about the steps again.\n\nFor each j in 0 to m-1:\n   max_val = max of all s[j] for s in students\n   collect all i where s[i][j] == max_val\n\nOnce I have for each j a list of students who are the best in j, then for each student, if they are in any of these lists for any j, they are successful.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read all the students' strings into a list called students.\n2. For each subject j from 0 to m-1:\n   a. Iterate over each student's j-th character.\n   b. Find the maximum value among them.\n   c. Find all students whose j-th character equals this max.\n   d. Store this information for each j.\n3. For each student, check if they are in any of the j's max students.\n4. Count the total number of such students.\n\nThis approach should work.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read n and m. Wait, but the input is given as a single line with n and m, but sometimes, in some programming contest inputs, the lines can be split by \\n or not. Looking back at the problem statement: The first line contains two integers, then next n lines each contain m characters.\n\nSo in the sample input, it's written as ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111'], which suggests that the entire input is a single string, but perhaps in reality, the input is read line by line.\n\nWait, the way it's presented is a bit unclear. Maybe in the actual input, each line is separate. So in code, I can read the first line as n and m, then read the next n lines as the students' grades.\n\nSo for the sample input, the first line after n=3 and m=3 is '223', which is the first student's grades.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nThen, for each j in 0..m-1:\n\ncurrent_max = -1\nbest_students = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    c = students[i][j]\n    if c > current_max:\n        current_max = c\n        best_students = [i]\n    elif c == current_max:\n        best_students.append(i)\n\nWait, but this is for each subject j. So for j from 0 to m-1:\n\nCreate a list called subject_best, where subject_best[j] is a list of student indices (0-based) who have the maximum in that subject.\n\nSo I can initialize a list of m elements, each being a list.\n\nsubject_best = [[] for _ in range(m)]\n\nThen, for each j:\n\nmax_char = max(students[i][j] for i in range(n))\nbest_indices = [i for i in range(n) if students[i][j] == max_char]\nsubject_best[j] = best_indices\n\nYes, that would be more efficient.\n\nOnce I have subject_best, then for each student i, check if they are in any of the subject_best[j] lists.\n\nSo:\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if i in subject_best[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nStudents:\n\nStudent 0: \"223\" → subjects 0,1,2 are '2','2','3'\nStudent 1: \"232\" → '2','3','2'\nStudent 2: \"112\" → '1','1','2'\n\nProcessing each subject j:\n\nj=0: all students' 0th char: '2', '2', '1' → max is '2'. So best students are 0 and 1.\n\nsubject_best[0] = [0,1]\n\nj=1: '2', '3', '1' → max is '3' (student 1). So subject_best[1] = [1]\n\nj=2: '3','2','2' → max is '3' (student 0). So subject_best[2] = [0]\n\nNow, for each student:\n\nStudent 0: is in subject_best[0] and subject_best[2] → yes.\nStudent 1: in subject_best[0] and subject_best[1] → yes.\nStudent 2: not in any → no.\n\nSo count is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3 5\n91728\n11828\n11111\n\nWait, wait the sample input is actually given as two separate entries, but perhaps it's a typo. Or perhaps the input is a list of two lines. Anyway, in the sample output, the second case has 3 successful students.\n\nSo for each subject, the max is held by one student, but each student is the max in at least one subject.\n\nThus, according to the code, each student will be counted.\n\nSo the code should handle that correctly.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, m=1. Then the student is successful.\n\nWhat about when two students have the same max in a subject? Like student 0 and 1 both have 9 in a subject. Then, both are considered best, and thus, for each of them, they may be successful if they are the best in at least one subject.\n\nSo the code correctly captures that.\n\nNow, let's consider the data structures. For each j, the best_students can be stored as a list of integers. Then, checking for a student i is O(m) in the worst case, but since m is up to 100, it's acceptable.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Reading the input correctly. The students' grades are given as m-character strings. So each student's string must be exactly m characters long. But the problem statement says each character is from 1 to 9, so it's okay.\n\n- Handling cases where all students have the same mark in a subject. Then all are best in that subject.\n\n- Time constraints: n and m up to 100. For each subject, finding the max is O(n*m), which is 100*100=10^4 operations. Then, for each student, checking m subjects, each with up to n students in their best list. But for each student, in the worst case, it's m checks, each O(1) if using a set.\n\nWait, in the current code, the subject_best[j] is a list. So checking if i is in the list is O(k), where k is the length of the list. But since for each j, the list can have up to n students, in the worst case, for each student, each j check is O(n), leading to O(mn^2) time.\n\nHmm, for n=100, m=100, that's 1e6 operations, which is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps using a set for each subject_best[j] would make the 'in' operation O(1). So for better performance, maybe it's better to represent each subject_best[j] as a set.\n\nSo during the processing, for each j:\n\nmax_char = max(...)\nbest_indices = {i for i, c in enumerate(row) if c == max_char}\n\nBut in Python, for each j, we can create a set.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nsubject_best = [set() for _ in range(m)]\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_char = max(students[i][j] for i in range(n))\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] == max_char:\n            subject_best[j].add(i)\n\nThen, for each student i:\n\nif i in subject_best[0] or i in subject_best[1] ... or any of the m sets.\n\nThis way, checking is O(1) per subject.\n\nWhich is better, especially if n is large.\n\nSo in code, it's better to use sets for subject_best.\n\nYes, that would improve the efficiency.\n\nSo the steps now are:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the next n lines as the students' grade strings.\n\nInitialize subject_best as a list of m sets.\n\nFor each j in 0 to m-1:\n   find the max_char among all students' j-th character.\n   add all students i where students[i][j] == max_char to subject_best[j].\n\nThen, for each student i:\n   if i is in any of the subject_best[j], increment count.\n\nReturn the count.\n\nYes.\n\nSo now, the code:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nstudents = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nsubject_best = [set() for _ in range(m)]\n\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_char = max(students[i][j] for i in range(n))\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] == max_char:\n            subject_best[j].add(i)\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if i in subject_best[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but in the sample input 1, the output is 2, which is correct.\n\nIn the second sample, each student is in at least one subject's best, so the count is 3.\n\nThis code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting another case: n=2, m=2.\n\nStudents:\n\n99\n11\n\nSubject 0: j=0. Both '9' and '1' → max is 9, only student 0.\n\nSubject 1: j=1. '9' and '1' → max 9, only student 0.\n\nSo subject_best[0] = {0}, subject_best[1] = {0}.\n\nSo both students: student 0 is in both, student 1 is not. So count is 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2.\n\nStudents:\n\n51\n51\n\nBoth have same marks. So in subject 0, both are best. In subject 1, both are best.\n\nSo subject_best[0] = {0,1}, subject_best[1] = {0,1}.\n\nSo each student is in both sets. So count is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, m=5. Student has all 1s. Since it's the only student, in all subjects, he is the best. So count is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nI think that's the correct approach.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects.
