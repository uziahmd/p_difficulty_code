Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter 'X'. Hmm, let's think about what the problem says.\n\nThe conditions for it being an X are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter all along.\n2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must be the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nWait, right. So first, I need to check the two main diagonals. For each cell in these diagonals, they should all be the same character. Let's call this the 'X' character.\n\nThen, all the cells that are not on either of these diagonals should be the same and different from the X character.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is n followed by n lines each containing n characters. Oh right, but since the input might have quotes or something, I need to make sure I'm reading it correctly. Probably, each line is a string, and I can split them into rows.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read n.\n- Read the next n lines, each line as a string, and store them in a 2D list or grid.\n- Then, check the two diagonals.\n\nHow to find the diagonals? For a square grid of size n x n, the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1,n-1), and the anti-diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0).\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j), if i == j, it's on the main diagonal. If i + j == n - 1, it's on the anti-diagonal.\n\nI need to collect all the characters on both diagonals and check if they are all the same.\n\nOnce that's done, collect the non-diagonal cells and check if they are all the same and different from the diagonal.\n\nWait, but what if the diagonals have different characters? Like, some are 'x' and others are 'y'? Then it's automatically not an X. So first, I should check whether all the diagonal cells are the same.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Extract all diagonal cells.\n   - For main diagonal: for i from 0 to n-1, take grid[i][i].\n   - For anti-diagonal: for i from 0 to n-1, take grid[i][n-1 - i].\n   - Combine these into a single list, say diag_chars.\n\n2. Check if all elements in diag_chars are the same. Let's call this c_diag. If not, then it's not an X.\n\n3. Now, check the non-diagonal cells. For each cell not on any diagonal, check if all are the same, say c_other, and c_other != c_diag.\n\nBut wait, what if all non-diagonal cells are the same as the diagonal? Then it's not allowed. They have to be different.\n\nAlso, what if n is 3?\n\nLet me think about the example given.\n\nIn the sample input, the second case is 3x3 grid:\nw s w\ns w s\nw s w\n\nWait, no, wait the second sample input is:\n\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nWait, so the main diagonal is w, w, w. The anti-diagonal is w, w, w. So all diagonals are 'w's.\n\nThe non-diagonal cells are s's. So it satisfies the condition, output YES.\n\nAnother example: third input is 3x3:\n\nx p x\np x p\nx p x\n\nWait, main diagonal is x, x, x. Anti-diagonal is x, x, x. Wait, no, because in the third row, the last element is x. So the anti-diagonal is x at (0,2), x at (1,1), x at (2,0). So all are x.\n\nWait, but then the non-diagonals are p's. So that's an X. But according to the sample output, it's NO. Wait, no. Wait the third sample input is:\n\n3\nxpx\npxp\nxpe\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me see:\n\nThird input is:\n\n3\nx p x\np x p\nx p e\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should reconstruct the grid.\n\nWait, the third input is '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe'. So the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x p x\nRow 1: p x p\nRow 2: x p e\n\nSo the main diagonal is (0,0)=x, (1,1)=x, (2,2)=e. So diag_chars are x, x, e. Not all same. So condition 1 fails, hence output",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter 'X'. The grid must satisfy specific conditions regarding its diagonals and non-diagonal cells.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: First, read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Extract Diagonals**: Identify the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left). Collect all characters from both diagonals.\n3. **Check Diagonals**: Verify if all characters on both diagonals are the same. If they are not, the grid does not form an 'X'.\n4. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**: Ensure that all cells not on the diagonals contain the same character, which must be different from the diagonal characters.\n5. **Output Result**: Based on the checks, output \"YES\" if the grid forms an 'X', otherwise output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Function to check if all characters in a list are the same\ndef all_same(chars):\n    return len(set(chars)) == 1\n\n# Extract diagonals\ndiag_chars = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    diag_chars.append(grid[i][i])\n    diag_chars.append(grid[i][n-1 - i])\n\nif not all_same(diag_chars):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    c_diag = diag_chars[0]\n    # Check other cells\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue  # Skip diagonals\n            if grid[i][j] != c_diag:\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if not valid:\n            break\n    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The grid is read as a list of strings, each representing a row.\n- **Diagonal Extraction**: We iterate through the grid to collect characters from both diagonals.\n- **Checking Uniformity**: Using a helper function, we check if all collected diagonal characters are the same.\n- **Non-Diagonal Check**: We ensure all non-diagonal cells have the same character, different from the diagonal characters.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently checks each cell exactly once, ensuring it runs in O(n^2) time, which is optimal for the given constraints.",
