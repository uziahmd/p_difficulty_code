The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where Neko found some treasure chests and keys, and needs to open as many chests as possible. The way it works is that each key can unlock a chest if the sum of their numbers is odd. Hmm, right.\n\nLet me think about how the keys and chests interact. Each key can be used once, and each chest can be opened once. So for each key, I need to find a chest where a_i + b_j is odd. But since we want to maximize the number of chests opened, I need to figure out how to pair the keys and chests optimally.\n\nWait, the condition a_i + b_j is odd implies that one is even and the other is odd. So, for each key, it can only unlock a chest of the opposite parity. That makes sense.\n\nSo maybe I should separate the chests into two groups: those with even a_i and those with odd a_i. Similarly for the keys.\n\nLet me see. Let's say:\n\n- For the keys, count how many are even (let's call it E_b) and how many are odd (O_b).\n- For the chests, count how many have even a_i (E_a) and odd a_i (O_a).\n\nNow, each key can unlock a chest of opposite parity. So an even key can only unlock an odd chest, and an odd key can only unlock an even chest.\n\nBut how do we pair them to maximize the number of chests opened?\n\nI think the maximum number of chests is the sum of the minimum of E_b * O_a and O_b * E_a, but that might not capture the optimal pairing correctly. Or wait, maybe it's more about matching the keys and chests in such a way that for each type, we take as much as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal approach is to:\n\n1. Use as many even keys as possible to open odd chests.\n2. Use the remaining keys to open the other type of chests.\n\nOr perhaps it's better to consider all possibilities and choose the maximum.\n\nLet me think differently. The total possible pairs would be the minimum between:\n\n- The number of even keys times the number of odd chests, plus the number of odd keys times the number of even chests.\n\nWait, no. Because each key can only be used once, so it's more like, for each key, you can choose to use it on a chest that matches its parity.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of chests is the maximum of two possibilities:\n\nEither:\n\n- We use all even keys to open odd chests, and then use the remaining odd keys to open even chests.\n\nOr:\n\n- We use all odd keys to open even chests, and then use the remaining even keys to open odd chests.\n\nWait, but that might not always give the maximum. Because sometimes using a mix could yield a better result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum possible is the sum of the minimum between the number of even keys and the number of odd chests, plus the minimum between the remaining keys and the remaining chests.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate four possible scenarios:\n\n1. All even keys are used to open odd chests. Then, the remaining odd keys are used to open even chests.\n\nThe number of chests opened here would be min(E_b, O_a) + min(O_b, E_a - (E_b - min(E_b, O_a)))... Wait, not sure.\n\nWait, let's clarify.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- E_b = number of even keys.\n- O_b = number of odd keys.\n\nSimilarly, E_a is the number of even chests, O_a is the number of odd chests.\n\nWe need to decide how many even keys to allocate to odd chests, and how many odd keys to allocate to even chests.\n\nLet’s say x is the number of even keys used for odd chests. Then, since each even key can only open an odd chest, the maximum x is min(E_b, O_a). Once x is chosen, the remaining even keys (E_b -x) can't be used because they can't open any other chests (since even + even is even, which doesn't satisfy the condition). So for the remaining, maybe we can use the odd keys to open the even chests.\n\nWait, but after using x even keys on odd chests, the remaining odd chests are O_a - x.\n\nThen, the number of odd keys we can use is y = min(O_b, E_a - (O_a -x)) or something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of chests is the maximum of:\n\n- Using all even keys on odd chests, then using as many odd keys as possible on the remaining even chests.\n\nOR\n\n- Using all odd keys on even chests, then using as many even keys as possible on the remaining odd chests.\n\nAnd then also considering other possibilities, like using some even keys and some odd keys.\n\nWait, but this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAnother approach: the maximum number of chests is the sum of the minimum of E_b and O_a, and the minimum of O_b and (E_a - (O_a - min(E_b, O_a)) ) ... No, perhaps that's getting too messy.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of chests is the maximum of two values:\n\na) The sum of even keys and odd chests, but ensuring that each key can be matched.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe maximum number of chests is the maximum of the following two possibilities:\n\n1. We match as many even keys as possible with odd chests, and then match as many odd keys as possible with the remaining even chests.\n\nIn this case, the total would be x + y, where x is min(E_b, O_a), and y is min(O_b, E_a - (O_a - x)). Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, after using x even keys on odd chests, the remaining even keys can't be used. So for the even chests that were not opened by even keys, we can try to use odd keys. But the number of even chests not covered by even keys is E_a - (number of even keys used on even chests?) No, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nPerhaps another way: the problem is similar to bipartite matching, but given the constraints, it's probably better to model it in terms of counts.\n\nLet me try to think of it as a resource allocation problem.\n\nEach even key can be used to open an odd chest, and each odd key can be used to open an even chest.\n\nSo the total possible chests is the sum of:\n\nmin(E_b, O_a) [even keys opening odd chests] + min(O_b, E_a_remaining)\n\nBut what's E_a_remaining after using some even keys?\n\nWait, after using x even keys to open O_a chests, the remaining even chests are E_a.\n\nBecause the even chests could have been opened either by even keys or odd keys. So, the even chests that are available to be opened by odd keys are E_a minus the number of even chests opened by even keys.\n\nWait, but the even chests that are not opened by even keys can be opened by odd keys.\n\nSo, suppose we have x even keys used on odd chests. Then, the remaining odd chests are O_a - x.\n\nWait, no, O_a is the total number of odd chests. If x of them are opened by even keys, the remaining O_a - x can be opened by odd keys.\n\nBut wait, no. The O_a - x is the number of odd chests that weren't opened by even keys. These can be opened by odd keys, but each odd key can only be used once.\n\nWait, maybe the process is:\n\n1. Use as many even keys as possible on odd chests. Let x = min(E_b, O_a). So x even keys are used, opening x odd chests.\n\n2. Then, use as many odd keys as possible on even chests. How many even chests are left? Well, E_a is the total even chests. Some of them may have been opened by even keys, but wait, no— because even keys can only open odd chests. Oh right! Because even + odd is odd. So even keys can't open even chests. So the even chests are only opened by odd keys.\n\nWait a minute, that's an important point. Even keys can't open even chests. They can only open odd chests.\n\nSo, the even chests are all candidates to be opened by odd keys. So, for the even chests, the number that can be opened is the minimum of O_b (number of odd keys) and E_a (number of even chests).\n\nBut wait, no. Because some of the odd keys might have been used to open even chests, but perhaps not all.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- The maximum number of chests is equal to the sum of:\n\n   a) The number of even keys that can be used on odd chests (which is min(E_b, O_a)).\n\n   b) The number of odd keys that can be used on even chests (which is min(O_b, E_a)).\n\nBut wait, that's not correct because when you use even keys on odd chests, you might be using up some of the odd chests, leaving less for the odd keys.\n\nNo, no. Because the even keys and odd keys are separate. The even keys can't affect the availability of even chests for the odd keys.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the even keys are used on odd chests, and the odd keys are used on even chests. So the total is the sum of these two.\n\nBut that can't be right because the two are independent; the usage of even keys doesn't affect the ability to use odd keys, except for the counts.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum number of chests is the sum of:\n\nmin(E_b, O_a) + min(O_b, E_a).\n\nBut wait, that's not correct because it's possible that some chests are overlapping.\n\nNo, because the two are separate: even keys unlock odd chests, and odd keys unlock even chests. So the two sets are disjoint. So the total is the sum of the two.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in some cases, even if you have enough even keys and odd keys, you might not have enough chests of each type.\n\nWait, for example, if E_b is 3, O_a is 5, O_b is 4, E_a is 2.\n\nThen min(E_b, O_a) is 3, min(O_b, E_a) is 2. Sum is 5.\n\nWhich is correct because 3 even keys unlock 3 odd chests, and 2 odd keys unlock 2 even chests. Total 5.\n\nBut what if E_b is 5, O_a is 3, O_b is 2, E_a is 4.\n\nThen min(E_b, O_a)=3, min(O_b, E_a)=2. Sum is 5.\n\nBut what if E_b is 10, O_a is 5, O_b is 10, E_a is 3.\n\nThen min(E_b, O_a)=5, min(O_b, E_a)=3. Sum is 8.\n\nWhich is correct because 5 even keys unlock 5 odd chests, and 3 odd keys unlock 3 even chests.\n\nSo in this case, the sum is indeed 8.\n\nBut wait, is there a case where this sum overcounts?\n\nHmm, suppose E_b=2, O_a=3, O_b=2, E_a=3.\n\nSo min(E_b, O_a)=2, min(O_b, E_a)=2. Sum is 4.\n\nWhich is correct: 2 even keys unlock 2 odd chests, 2 odd keys unlock 2 even chests. Total 4.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if E_b=2, O_a=3, O_b=3, E_a=2.\n\nSum is 2+2=4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut what if E_b=3, O_a=2, O_b=3, E_a=3.\n\nThen sum is 2+3=5. But the total number of chests is 2+3=5, which is correct.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum of the two minima: min(E_b, O_a) + min(O_b, E_a).\n\nIs that always the maximum possible?\n\nWait, but in some cases, maybe it's better to use some even keys on odd chests and some odd keys on even chests, but not all possible.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, the sum of the two minima gives the maximum possible.\n\nSo perhaps the solution is to compute:\n\nmax_chests = min(E_b, O_a) + min(O_b, E_a)\n\nBut wait, let me test another scenario.\n\nSuppose E_b=5, O_a=4, O_b=5, E_a=3.\n\nSo min(E_b, O_a)=4, min(O_b, E_a)=3. Sum is 7.\n\nWhich is correct: 4 even keys unlock 4 odd chests, and 3 odd keys unlock 3 even chests. Total 7.\n\nBut what if E_b=4, O_a=5, O_b=6, E_a=3.\n\nmin(E_b, O_a)=4, min(O_b, E_a)=3. Sum is 7.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: the first example in the problem statement.\n\nInput:\n\n5 chests, 4 keys.\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11] → let's count even and odd.\n\nLooking at a:\n\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd.\n\nSo O_a = 2, E_a =3.\n\nb = [8,4,7,20]. So 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even.\n\nE_b =3, O_b=1.\n\nSo min(E_b, O_a) = min(3, 2) =2.\n\nmin(O_b, E_a)=min(1,3)=1.\n\nTotal 3.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=5, m=1.\n\na = [2,4,6,8,10] → all even. So E_a=5.\n\nb = [5], which is odd. So O_b=1.\n\nSo min(E_b, O_a): E_b is 0 (since all b are odd), O_a is 0 (all a are even). So min is 0.\n\nmin(O_b, E_a) = min(1,5)=1.\n\nSo total 1, which matches the sample.\n\nThird example:\n\nn=1, m=4.\n\na=[10], which is even.\n\nb has 20,30,40,50 → all even.\n\nSo E_a=1, O_b=0.\n\nmin(E_b, O_a) is min(4,0)=0.\n\nmin(O_b, E_a)=min(0,1)=0.\n\nTotal 0, which matches the sample.\n\nSo from these examples, the approach seems to work.\n\nSo the steps for the solution are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd keys (E_b, O_b).\n\n2. Count the number of even and odd chests (E_a, O_a).\n\n3. Compute the sum of min(E_b, O_a) + min(O_b, E_a).\n\nThat's the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n\nWait, but is that always correct? Are there cases where this approach would fail?\n\nLet me think of a case where E_b=3, O_a=3, E_a=3, O_b=3.\n\nThen min(E_b, O_a)=3, min(O_b, E_a)=3. Sum is 6.\n\nWhich is correct because all even keys are used on odd chests (3), and all odd keys are used on even chests (3). Total 6.\n\nAnother test case: E_b=1, O_a=3, E_a=2, O_b=1.\n\nsum is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nWhich is correct: use 1 even key on 1 of 3 odd chests. Then use 1 odd key on 1 of 2 even chests. So total 2.\n\nBut what if E_b=2, O_a=2, E_a=3, O_b=2.\n\nsum is 2 +2=4.\n\nWhich is correct: 2 even keys unlock 2 odd chests, 2 odd keys unlock 2 even chests. Total 4.\n\nAnother case: E_b=2, O_a=3, E_a=4, O_b=2.\n\nsum is 2 +2=4. So 4 chests.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWhat about a case where using some keys on chests allows more to be unlocked?\n\nWait, suppose E_b=1, O_a=5, E_a=3, O_b=1.\n\nsum is 1 +1 =2.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is:\n\nUse the even key on one odd chest (1), then use the odd key on one even chest (1). So total 2.\n\nWhich is same as sum.\n\nAnother scenario: E_b=3, O_a=2, E_a=3, O_b=3.\n\nsum is min(3,2)=2, min(3,3)=3 → total 5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo I can't think of a case where this approach fails.\n\nThus, the solution is to compute the sum of the two minima.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read n and m.\n\n- Read the list a, count how many even and odd numbers.\n\n- Read the list b, count how many even and odd numbers.\n\n- Compute min(even_keys, odd_chests) + min(odd_keys, even_chests).\n\n- Output that number.\n\nWait, but wait: in the code, what about the data types? Since the a and b can be very large, but we only care about their parity, not their actual value.\n\nSo, for each a_i, determine if it's even or odd, and count E_a and O_a.\n\nSame for b_j.\n\nSo the code steps are straightforward.\n\nNow, let's think about handling the input.\n\nIn Python, reading from stdin can be done via input().split(), but for larger inputs, it's better to read via sys.stdin.\n\nBut for the problem, the constraints are manageable with standard methods.\n\nSo, the code outline:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead a list.\n\nCompute E_a = number of elements in a that are even.\n\nO_a = n - E_a.\n\nRead b list.\n\nCompute E_b = number of elements in b that are even.\n\nO_b = m - E_b.\n\nCompute res = min(E_b, O_a) + min(O_b, E_a).\n\nPrint res.\n\nYes, that's the plan.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample:\n\nn=5, m=4.\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11] → O_a=2, E_a=3.\n\nb = [8,4,7,20] → E_b=3, O_b=1.\n\nres = min(3,2)=2 + min(1,3)=1 → 3.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nn=5, m=1.\n\na: all even → E_a=5.\n\nb: [5] → O_b=1.\n\nres = min(0,0) + min(1,5) → 0 +1=1.\n\nThird sample:\n\nn=1, m=4.\n\na: 10 → E_a=1.\n\nb: all even → E_b=4.\n\nres = min(4,0) + min(0,1) →0+0=0.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, m=3.\n\na = [1,3,5] → O_a=3.\n\nb = [2,4,6] → E_b=3.\n\nres = min(3,3)=3 + min(0,0)=0 → 3.\n\nWhich is correct because all 3 even keys unlock 3 odd chests.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, m=3.\n\na = [2,4,6] → E_a=3.\n\nb = [1,3,5] → O_b=3.\n\nres = min(0,3)=0 + min(3,3)=3 →3.\n\nSo, 3 chests opened.\n\nBut wait, can we do better? Because each even chest must be opened by an odd key, but we have 3 odd keys. So yes, 3 is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=4, m=4.\n\na = [1,2,3,4] → O_a=2, E_a=2.\n\nb = [1,2,3,4] → O_b=2, E_b=2.\n\nres = min(2,2)=2 + min(2,2)=2 →4.\n\nWhich is correct: 2 even keys unlock 2 odd chests, 2 odd keys unlock 2 even chests. Total 4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nWe can proceed as follows.\n\nRead n and m from the first line.\n\nRead the second line as list a.\n\nCompute E_a and O_a.\n\nRead the third line as list b.\n\nCompute E_b and O_b.\n\nCompute res = min(E_b, O_a) + min(O_b, E_a).\n\nPrint(res).\n\nBut wait, in the sample inputs, the input was given as ['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50'], but in the code, we're reading lines as a single string, perhaps? Or perhaps in the problem, the input is provided as three separate lines.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the input is given as three lines.\n\nSo, in code, the first line is n and m.\n\nThe second line is the a list.\n\nThe third line is the b list.\n\nSo, in the code, the input is read as:\n\nline1 = input().strip()\n\nline2 = input().strip()\n\nline3 = input().strip()\n\nThen, split each into integers.\n\nBut wait, the sample input shows that the first line is '5 4' which is correct.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nb = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nE_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n\nO_a = n - E_a\n\nE_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 ==0)\n\nO_b = m - E_b\n\nres = min(E_b, O_a) + min(O_b, E_a)\n\nprint(res)\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nTesting this against the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=5, m=4.\n\na has 3 evens, 2 odds.\n\nb has 3 evens, 1 odd.\n\nres= 2+1=3.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=5, m=1.\n\na all even: E_a=5.\n\nb has 1 odd.\n\nres=0 +1=1.\n\nSample 3:\n\nn=1, m=4.\n\na has 1 even.\n\nb has 4 evens.\n\nres=0+0=0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3, m=3.\n\na: [1,3,5] → O_a=3.\n\nb: [2,4,6] → E_b=3.\n\nres=3+0=3.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
