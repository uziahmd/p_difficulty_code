The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about radio towers in towns. There are n+2 towns, numbered from 0 to n+1. We build a tower in each town 1 to n with probability 1/2 each, independently. Then, we assign each built tower a signal power between 1 and n. The goal is to set these powers such that:\n\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 get no signal.\n2. Each of the towns 1 to n gets exactly one signal.\n\nWe need to compute the probability of being able to do this, modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm. So the probability is the number of valid configurations divided by the total possible configurations, which is (2^n). Because each tower is built or not with probability 1/2, so 2^n possibilities.\n\nBut how to count the valid configurations?\n\nLet me think about what makes a configuration valid.\n\nEach town from 1 to n must be covered exactly once. Also, the signal can't reach town 0 or n+1.\n\nSo for a given set S of built towers, can we assign signal powers such that every town 1..n is covered exactly once, and 0 and n+1 are not covered?\n\nWait, but the way the signal works is that a tower at i with power p covers all towns c where |c -i| < p. So the coverage is [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)].\n\nSo for a tower at i, the range is i - (p-1) to i + (p-1). But since p must be at least 1, the range is at least 1 town.\n\nWait, for example, if p=1, it covers just i. For p=2, it covers i-1 and i+1. Wait no, because |c -i| < p is the same as c being in (i - p, i + p), but since c must be an integer, the range is i - (p-1) to i + (p-1), inclusive? Or wait, maybe not. Let's see: when p=2, |c-i| < 2 means c can be i-1, i, i+1. So yes, three towns.\n\nSo each tower's coverage is a range of length 2p-1. Because from i-p+1 to i+p-1, inclusive, the length is 2p-1.\n\nNow, the constraints are:\n\n- Town 0 and n+1 must not be covered by any tower.\n- Towns 1..n must be covered exactly once.\n\nSo, for the entire setup, the union of the ranges of the towers must cover exactly 1..n, without overlapping except possibly at the edges. Wait, but each town must be covered exactly once. So the ranges must form a partition of the towns 1..n.\n\nHmm. So the ranges must form a non-overlapping, covering partition of 1..n.\n\nMoreover, the ranges cannot extend beyond 0 or n+1. So for town 0, no tower can have a range that includes it. Similarly for n+1.\n\nSo let's model this as a tiling problem. Each tower's range must fit within 1..n, and the ranges must exactly cover 1..n without overlapping.\n\nWhat does this imply about the arrangement of the towers?\n\nWell, the ranges must form a partition of 1..n into consecutive intervals, each assigned to exactly one tower.\n\nWait, perhaps this is similar to the idea of placing non-overlapping intervals that together cover the entire range.\n\nEach interval is determined by the tower's position and its power.\n\nFor example, a tower at position i with power p covers [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)]. But this must not include 0 or n+1.\n\nSo for each tower, its range must lie entirely within 1..n.\n\nWhich implies that for a tower at position i, the power p must satisfy i - (p-1) ≥ 1 and i + (p-1) ≤ n.\n\nRearranged, p must be ≤ i (since i - (p-1) ≥1 → p ≤ i), and p ≤ n - i +1.\n\nWait, i + (p-1) ≤n → p ≤ n -i +1.\n\nSo p is at most min(i, n-i+1).\n\nBut also, each tower's range must be such that their combined coverage is exactly 1..n, with no overlaps.\n\nSo the ranges must form a perfect partition.\n\nThis suggests that the valid configurations are those where the towers form a structure where each tower's coverage is a segment that doesn't overlap with others, and together they cover everything.\n\nThis seems similar to a concept in combinatorics known as \"tilings\"",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that we can set the signal powers of radio towers such that each town from 1 to n is covered exactly once, while towns 0 and n+1 are not covered at all. The probability should be computed modulo 998244353.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be approached by recognizing that valid configurations of towers form a structure where each tower's coverage is a segment that doesn't overlap with others, and together they cover all towns from 1 to n. This is analogous to tiling the line segment from 1 to n with non-overlapping intervals, each centered at a built tower.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1. **Identify Valid Configurations**: A configuration is valid if the intervals covered by the towers form a perfect partition of the towns 1 to n without overlapping.\n2. **Count Valid Configurations**: Use dynamic programming to count the number of valid configurations. Let `dp[i]` represent the number of ways to cover the first `i` towns.\n3. **Probability Calculation**: The probability is the ratio of valid configurations to the total possible configurations, which is `2^n`. Compute this ratio modulo 998244353 using modular inverses.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Precompute factorial and inverse factorial up to n\n    max_n = n\n    fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):\n        fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD\n\n    inv_fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    inv_fact[max_n] = pow(fact[max_n], MOD-2, MOD)\n    for i in range(max_n -1, -1, -1):\n        inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD\n\n    def comb(a, b):\n        if a < b or b < 0:\n            return 0\n        return fact[a] * inv_fact[b] % MOD * inv_fact[a - b] % MOD\n\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # For each possible starting position j of a tower\n        for j in range(max(1, i - 200000), min(i, n - 200000) + 1):\n            if j >= 1 and j <= n:\n                p = min(j, n - j + 1)\n                if i - p + 1 >= 1:\n                    dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - p]) % MOD\n        # Additionally, check if placing a single tower covering exactly i\n        if i >= 1 and i <= n:\n            p = 1\n            if i - p + 1 >= 1 and i + p -1 <= n:\n                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - 1]) % MOD\n        # Also, consider placing a tower at i with p=1, which covers only i\n        if i >= 1:\n            dp[i] += dp[i-1]\n            dp[i] %= MOD\n\n    total = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    ans = dp[n] * pow(total, MOD-2, MOD) % MOD\n    print(ans)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We use `dp[i]` to represent the number of valid ways to cover the first `i` towns.\n2. **Transition**: For each town `i`, we consider placing a tower at various positions `j` and calculate the maximum power `p` it can have without extending beyond the bounds of the towns. We update `dp[i]` based on the valid configurations ending at `i`.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be modulo 998244353, we precompute factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently compute combinations and handle large numbers.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the valid configurations and computes the required probability using combinatorial methods and dynamic programming.",
