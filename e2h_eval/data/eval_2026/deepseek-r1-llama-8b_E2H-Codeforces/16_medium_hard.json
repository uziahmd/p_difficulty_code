Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem called Crazy Town. Hmm, let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to get from home to the university in Crazy Town. The town has several roads which are infinite lines on a plane. These roads divide the plane into blocks. We can move from one block to another only if they share a common border segment of non-zero length. So each step is moving across a shared boundary between two adjacent blocks.\n\nThe key here is to figure out how the roads partition the plane and determine how the home and university are positioned relative to these roads. Then, calculate the minimal steps needed to get from home to the university by crossing these roads.\n\nLet me think about the approach.\n\nEach road is an infinite line, and each such line contributes to the partitioning of the plane. For any point, the arrangement of the roads around it will create regions. The minimal steps would be determined by how many roads separate the home and the university.\n\nWait, but how? Because each time you cross a road, it's a step. But if multiple roads intersect, maybe the order in which you cross them affects the path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of roads that separate the two points. Because each such road would require crossing once.\n\nSo the idea is: for each road, determine whether it separates the home and the university. If it does, then we count that as a required step. The total number of such roads is the answer.\n\nBut wait, how do I determine if a line separates two points?\n\nA line divides the plane into two half-planes. So for a given point (x1,y1) and another point (x2,y2), if they lie on opposite sides of the line, then the line acts as a separator. Otherwise, it doesn't.\n\nSo the steps to solve the problem are:\n\n1. For each road (line), check whether the home and university are on opposite sides of it.\n2. Count the number of such roads where this is true.\n3. That count is the minimal number of steps needed.\n\nBecause each such separating line must be crossed exactly once in the path, and the minimal path can't avoid crossing any of them.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because even if the lines intersect, the minimal path would involve crossing each separating line once, regardless of the order.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- For each of the n roads:\n   - Compute the value of the line equation for both home and university.\n   - If the signs of these values are different, increment the count.\n- Output the count.\n\nWait, let me test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\nHome: (1,1)\nUniversity: (-1,-1)\nn=2\nRoad 1: 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y=0.\nFor home: 1*1 + 0 +0=1>0.\nUniversity: 1*(-1)+0= -1<0. So they are on opposite sides. So count +=1.\n\nRoad 2: 1x +0y +0=0 → x=0.\nHome: 1*1+0=1>0.\nUniversity: 1*(-1)= -1<0. So again, opposite sides. So count +=1.\n\nTotal is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: what if there are three roads, and the home and university are separated by two of them, but not the third.\n\nThen the minimal steps would be 2.\n\nSo, the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute for each line whether the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nHow to compute this?\n\nGiven a line ax + by + c = 0, for a point (x0, y0), compute ax0 + by0 + c.\n\nIf this value is positive, negative, or zero determines which side the point is on.\n\nSince neither home nor university lies on any road, their evaluation for any line won't be zero.\n\nSo for each line, evaluate home_val = a*x1 + b*y1 +c and uni_val = a*x2 +b*y2 +c.\n\nIf home_val * uni_val < 0, then the points are on opposite sides, and thus the line is a separator. So we count it.\n\nSo the code steps are:\n\nRead home (x1, y1)\nRead university (x2, y2)\nRead n\nFor each of the next n lines:\n   read a, b, c\n   compute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n   compute val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n   if val1 * val2 < 0 → increment count\nAt the end, output count.\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nWhat if the line is vertical or horizontal? Doesn't matter; the same logic applies.\n\nWhat if the points are on the same side of all lines? Then count is zero, meaning you can move directly without crossing any roads.\n\nWhat if no roads are present (n=0)? Well, according to the input constraints, n is at least 1, so that's not a case.\n\nWait, looking back: the input says n is between 1 and 300.\n\nAnother case: a line could have a very large a and b, but the calculation is fine because Python handles big integers well.\n\nPotential issues: when the product is zero? But the problem statement says that neither home nor university lie on any of the roads. So val1 and val2 can't be zero, so their product can't be zero. So no need to worry about that.\n\nSo the code is manageable.\n\nImplementing it:\n\nWe can read the inputs as per the problem.\n\nIn Python, reading from standard input can be done via input() or sys.stdin.\n\nBut for handling multiple lines, especially with possibly large numbers, using sys.stdin.readline is better.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    # compute for home\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    # compute for university\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0) or (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0):\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but why not just compute if val1 * val2 < 0?\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nif val1 * val2 < 0: count +=1\n\nWhich is more efficient and concise.\n\nSo the code becomes:\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nTesting it against the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n1 1\n-1 -1\n2\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nFirst line after home and university is 2, n=2.\n\nFirst road: a=0, b=1, c=0 → line y=0.\n\nval1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0=1>0.\nval2=0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0= -1<0 → product is negative → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: a=1, b=0, c=0 → x=0.\n\nval1=1*1 +0*1 +0=1>0.\nval2=1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0= -1<0 → product is negative → count +=1.\n\nTotal is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: suppose home and uni are on the same side of all roads. So count is zero.\n\nAnother test case: home and uni are on opposite sides of one road. So count is 1.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n",

If these values have opposite signs, the road separates the two points.\n- **Counting Separators**: The total count of such separating roads is printed as the result, representing the minimum number of steps needed to travel from home to university.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal steps by leveraging the geometric property of lines separating points, ensuring an optimal solution.",
