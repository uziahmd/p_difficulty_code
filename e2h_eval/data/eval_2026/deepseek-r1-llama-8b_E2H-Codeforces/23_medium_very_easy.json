            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles, and I have to find the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form at least one mentsu. A mentsu can be a triplet (three same tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\nHmm, let's break it down. First, I need to process each of the three input strings. Each string represents a tile, like '1s' means 1 of suit s.\n\nSo for each of the three cases, I need to determine the minimal number of tiles to add to form a mentsu.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the output is three numbers, each corresponding to the three initial tiles. So for each tile, we calculate how many more tiles are needed if that tile is part of a mentsu. Or maybe it's per each possible way the mentsu could be formed from the initial three.\n\nNo, maybe the output is three separate answers, each indicating the minimal tiles needed for each of the three scenarios where that particular tile is part of a mentsu.\n\nWait, looking at the example:\n\nInput:\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nOutput:\n['0', '0', '1']\n\nIn the first case, the three tiles form a shuntsu (1s, 2s, 3s), so 0 extra tiles needed.\n\nSecond case: three 9m, which is a triplet, so 0.\n\nThird case: 3p,9m,2p. She needs to add one tile to make either 1p,4p, or perhaps another arrangement. Like adding 1p would form 1p,2p,3p, making a shuntsu.\n\nSo for each of the three initial hands, we need to compute the minimal number of tiles to add to form any possible mentsu, considering all possibilities based on their own tiles.\n\nSo the approach is: For each of the three tiles, treat them as a starting point, and see what's the minimal number of tiles needed to complete a mentsu that includes any of the possible combinations involving those tiles.\n\nWait, but perhaps the mentsu doesn't necessarily include all three initial tiles. No, because when you draw new tiles, the total set must include at least one mentsu. So the initial three plus the drawn tiles together must contain a mentsu.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the mentsu is formed by any three of the tiles after drawing. So, the initial three plus the drawn ones must have at least three tiles forming a mentsu.\n\nSo our goal is to find the minimal number of tiles to add such that among all the tiles (initial + added), there exists at least one triplet or sequence.\n\nWait, but the question is about the minimal number of tiles to add. So we need to find the smallest k where the initial three plus k tiles allows for a mentsu.\n\nBut how? Let's think.\n\nFirst, let's represent the current tiles as a dictionary or list. For each possible mentsu that can be formed, determine how many tiles are missing from the initial three, and then the required k is the maximum of (3 - count_in_initial). Then take the minimum k over all possible mentsus.\n\nWait, no. Because we can choose any subset of the tiles to form a mentsu, not necessarily using all three. So for each possible mentsu (all possible triplets and sequences), we calculate how many tiles from that mentsu are already present in the initial three. Then, the number of tiles needed to complete it is 3 minus that count. The minimal k is the minimal value across all possible mentsus.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For the given three tiles, create a set containing all of them. Let's call this initial_tiles.\n\n2. Generate all possible mentsus. A mentsu can be a triplet (all same tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\n3. For each possible mentsu M, calculate how many tiles of M are present in initial_tiles.\n\n   a. For a triplet M (like 1m,1m,1m), the count is how many times M appears in initial_tiles.\n\n   b. For a sequence M (like 1m,2m,3m), count how many of these three are present in initial_tiles.\n\n4. For each M, the required tiles to complete it is (3 - count). So the minimal k is the minimal (3 - count) across all M's.\n\nBut wait, since the mentsu can be any possible triplet or sequence, we need to consider all possibilities.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Enumerate all possible mentsus (triplets and sequences), and for each, compute the number of tiles in the initial set that are part of that mentsu. Then, the required tiles to form that mentsu is 3 minus that number.\n\n- The minimal required across all mentsus is the answer.\n\nBut wait, the mentsu is any combination of three tiles. So for each possible triplet (same tile) and each possible sequence (three consecutive), we'll check if they can be formed with the initial tiles, and compute the required number of draws.\n\nSo let's proceed.\n\nFirst, let's generate all possible mentsus.\n\nTriplet mentsus:\n\nEach triplet is a single tile repeated three times, e.g., '1m', '2m', etc. There are 9 suits (each with 9 numbers), so 9*9=81 triplets.\n\nSequence mentsus:\n\nEach sequence consists of three consecutive numbers in the same suit. For example, 1m,2m,3m; 2m,3m,4m; ... up to 7m,8m,9m. Similarly for p and s. So for each suit, there are 7 possible sequences. So 3 suits *7=21 sequences.\n\nSo in total, 81+21=102 possible mentsus.\n\nFor each of these 102, we need to calculate how many tiles from the mentsu are present in the initial set.\n\nThen, the minimal k is the minimal (3 - count) across all mentsus.\n\nWait, but some mentsus may require less than zero draws if initial tiles have more than three. But in our problem, the initial is exactly three, so 3 - count can't be negative.\n\nWait, but for a triplet mentsu, the count can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\nSimilarly, for a sequence, the count can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\nSo for each mentsu, compute 3 - count, and find the minimal k across all mentsus.\n\nThe answer is the minimal k.\n\nSo now, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, read the three tiles. For each, extract the suit and number, store as a list of tuples.\n\nFor example, the input is ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p'], which becomes tiles = [('1','s'), ('2','s'), ('3','s')] for the first case.\n\nWe'll create a set of these tiles for quick look-up.\n\nThen, for each possible mentsu:\n\nCase 1: Triplet.\n\nLoop through all possible numbers 1-9 and suits m,p,s.\n\nFor each, the triplet is three copies of (number, suit). We check how many of these are in the initial set.\n\ncount = sum(1 for tile in triplet_mentsu if tile in initial_set)\n\nrequired = 3 - count.\n\nCompute for all 81 triplets.\n\nCase 2: Sequence.\n\nFor each suit, loop through numbers 1-7, creating sequences like (1, suit), (2, suit), (3, suit).\n\nFor each such sequence, count how many are present in the initial set.\n\nrequired = 3 - count.\n\nCompute for all 21 sequences.\n\nOnce all 102 mentsus are considered, find the minimal required.\n\nThat minimal required is the answer.\n\nSo now, let's think about the code structure.\n\nRead the input as a list of three strings.\n\ntiles = []\nfor _ in range(3):\n    s = input().strip()\n    num, suit = s[0], s[1]\n    tiles.append( (num, suit) )\n\nThen, create a set of these tiles.\n\ninitial_set = set( tiles )\n\nNow, generate all possible mentsus.\n\nInitialize min_draws to a high value, say 3, because in the worst case, you need to add 3 tiles to form a triplet.\n\nBut wait, for example, if all three initial tiles are part of a sequence, then required is 0.\n\nWait, but perhaps the initial set is already a mentsu, so the required is 0.\n\nSo the initial min_draws can be 3.\n\nThen, for each mentsu:\n\ncompute required, and if required < min_draws, update min_draws.\n\nOnce all mentsus are processed, output min_draws.\n\nSo, the code will have two loops: one for triplets, another for sequences.\n\nLet's write code for triplets.\n\nFor triplets:\n\nfor num in '123456789':\n    for suit in ['m','p','s']:\n        # the triplet is three copies of (num, suit)\n        triplet = [ (num, suit) ] *3\n        # count how many are in initial_set\n        count = 0\n        for t in triplet:\n            if t in initial_set:\n                count +=1\n        required = 3 - count\n        if required < min_draws:\n            min_draws = required\n\nWait, but this is inefficient because for each triplet, it's generating a list of three same elements and looping through them. But with 81 triplets, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a triplet, the count is just the number of times (num, suit) is present in the initial_set, but multiplied by 3?\n\nWait, no. Because the triplet requires three tiles of the same kind. So for the triplet (x,y), we need x,y,x in the set? No, no—wait, the triplet is three identical tiles. So for a triplet, the count is whether (x,y) is in the initial_set any number of times.\n\nWait no, no. Because the triplet is three of the same tile. So for example, if the initial_set has two copies of (x,y), then for the triplet mentsu (x,y), the count is 2, so required is 1.\n\nWait, yes. So for a triplet, the count is the number of (x,y) in the initial_set, regardless of how many copies. Because when you draw, you can add more copies.\n\nWait, but the mentsu is three tiles. So for a triplet, you need three copies. So if initial has two copies, you need one more. If it has three, you don't need anything.\n\nSo for a triplet mentsu, the required is max(3 - count, 0). Wait, no, because count can't exceed 3, as initial is three tiles. So for each triplet, the count is the number of tiles in initial_set that match (x,y). So required is 3 - count.\n\nBut in code, for each triplet, the count is the number of times (num, suit) appears in initial_set.\n\nWait, no. Because in the initial_set, each tile is unique. So for example, if the initial_set contains two '1m's, but in reality, the initial hand is three tiles, each could be same or different.\n\nWait, no. Because the input is three tiles, but they could have duplicates. For example, the second case in the sample input has three 9m's.\n\nSo in that case, for the triplet mentsu 9m, the count is 3, so required is 0.\n\nBut if the initial_set has two 9m's, then for the triplet mentsu 9m, the count is 2, so required is 1.\n\nWait, but in the initial hand, each tile is present once. Or wait, the initial hand is three tiles, but each tile is a specific instance. So for example, the initial hand could have two '1m's and one '2m'.\n\nIn that case, for the triplet mentsu 1m, the count is 2.\n\nSo the code needs to correctly count how many of the triplet's tiles are in the initial_set.\n\nSo for a triplet mentsu, the count is the number of times (num, suit) appears in the initial_set.\n\nBut since in the initial_set, each tile is represented once, even if the initial hand has multiple copies of the same tile.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial hand is a list of three tiles. So for example, if two tiles are '1m', then the initial_set will have {'1m'}, but in reality, the count is 2.\n\nWait, no. Because initial_set is a set, so each tile is stored once, regardless of how many times it appears in the initial hand.\n\nSo, for the initial hand, if the user has two '1m's, the initial_set will have one '1m' entry.\n\nSo, for a triplet mentsu, the count is 1 if '1m' is present in the initial_set, regardless of how many copies were in the initial hand.\n\nBut wait, that's incorrect. Because the actual count depends on how many copies are present in the initial hand.\n\nFor example, suppose initial hand is ['1m', '1m', '2m'].\n\nSo initial_set is {'1m', '2m'}.\n\nFor the triplet mentsu '1m', the count is 2 (since there are two '1m's in the initial hand), but in the initial_set, it's only one entry.\n\nSo the previous approach of counting occurrences in the initial_set is wrong.\n\nAh, right! So the initial_set is a set, but the initial hand may have multiple copies of the same tile.\n\nSo the initial code is wrong because it treats the count as the presence in the set, not the count in the hand.\n\nSo, for example, the initial hand is ['1m', '1m', '1m'], which forms a triplet. So for the triplet mentsu '1m', the count is 3, required is 0.\n\nBut according to the initial approach, initial_set is {'1m'}, so the count would be 1, leading to required 2, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, the mistake is that the initial_set is a set, but the count should be based on the actual number of tiles in the initial hand that match the mentsu's tiles.\n\nSo, how to represent this?\n\nInstead of using a set, perhaps we should count the frequency of each tile in the initial hand.\n\nSo, create a frequency dictionary.\n\nfreq = {}\nfor tile in tiles:\n    key = (tile[0], tile[1])\n    if key in freq:\n        freq[key] +=1\n    else:\n        freq[key] =1\n\nThen, for each mentsu, whether triplet or sequence, we can compute how many tiles in the initial hand match the mentsu's tiles.\n\nFor a triplet mentsu (x,y), the number of initial tiles matching (x,y) is freq.get( (x,y), 0 ). So required is 3 - that number.\n\nFor a sequence mentsu, the number of initial tiles matching each of the three tiles in the sequence is summed.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\n- Compute the frequency of each tile in the initial hand.\n\n- For each triplet mentsu (x,y), count = freq.get( (x,y), 0 ), required = 3 - count.\n\n- For each sequence mentsu (a,b,c), count = sum( freq.get(t, 0) for t in [(a,b), (b,b), (c,b)] ), required = 3 - count.\n\nSo, the code needs to be adjusted to use the frequency counts.\n\nSo, let's rework the plan.\n\nRead the three tiles, create a frequency dictionary.\n\nThen, for each triplet:\n\nloop through all 9 numbers, 3 suits.\n\nfor each, get the count from freq, compute required.\n\nfor each sequence:\n\nloop through 3 suits, 7 numbers per suit.\n\nfor each, get the count for each of the three tiles in the sequence, sum them, compute required.\n\nCompute the minimal required across all mentsus.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ntiles = []\nfor _ in range(3):\n    s = input().strip()\n    num, suit = s[0], s[1]\n    tiles.append( (num, suit) )\n\n# build frequency dict\nfreq = {}\nfor t in tiles:\n    key = (t[0], t[1])\n    if key in freq:\n        freq[key] +=1\n    else:\n        freq[key] =1\n\nmin_draws = 3  # maximum possible is 3, but probably lower\n\n# process triplets\nfor num in '123456789':\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        # triplet mentsu is three of (num, suit)\n        count = freq.get( (num, suit), 0 )\n        required = 3 - count\n        if required < min_draws:\n            min_draws = required\n\n# process sequences\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for num in range(1,8):  # 1 to 7 inclusive\n        a = str(num)\n        b = str(num + 1)\n        c = str(num + 2)\n        # sequence is (a,suit), (b,suit), (c,suit)\n        # count how many are present in initial hand\n        count = 0\n        for t in [ (a, suit), (b, suit), (c, suit) ]:\n            count += freq.get(t, 0)\n        required = 3 - count\n        if required < min_draws:\n            min_draws = required\n\nprint(min_draws)\n\nWait, but in the code above, for each triplet, it's considering how many (num, suit) are present in the initial hand. So if the initial hand has two copies, required is 1. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for a sequence, it's checking each of the three tiles in the sequence, summing their frequencies.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for the sample input:\n\nFirst case: 1s,2s,3s.\n\nfreq is {'1s':1, '2s':1, '3s':1}\n\nProcessing triplet mentsus:\n\nFor 1s triplet: count=1, required=2.\n\nFor 2s triplet: count=1, required=2.\n\netc.\n\nBut the shuntsu is 1s,2s,3s.\n\nFor the sequence 1s,2s,3s: count is 1+1+1=3, required is 0.\n\nSo the minimal is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSecond case: 9m,9m,9m.\n\nfreq is {'9m':3}.\n\nProcessing triplet 9m: count=3, required=0.\n\nSo minimal is 0.\n\nThird case: 3p,9m,2p.\n\nfreq is:\n\n('3p', 'p'):1\n\n('9m', 'm'):1\n\n('2p', 'p'):1\n\nProcessing triplet mentsus:\n\nLooking for any triplet where count is >=0.\n\nLike for 3p triplet: count=1, required=2.\n\nFor 9m triplet: count=1, required=2.\n\nFor 2p triplet: count=1, required=2.\n\nBut for sequences:\n\nCheck for sequences in 'p' suit.\n\nLooking for 1p,2p,3p: the initial has 2p and 3p. So count is 2, required 1.\n\nSimilarly, 3p,4p,5p: initial has 3p, but others are 0. Count is 1, required 2.\n\nOther sequences may have higher counts.\n\nSo the minimal required is 1.\n\nThus, the output is [0,0,1].\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle it correctly.\n\nAnother test case: what if the initial tiles are all different, but none can form a triplet or sequence without adding tiles.\n\nE.g., initial tiles: 1m, 2p, 5s.\n\nFor any triplet, count is 0 or 1.\n\nFor sequences:\n\nLooking for 1m,2m,3m: count is 1 (only 1m). So required is 2.\n\nSimilarly, 5s,6s,7s: count is 1 (5s). Required 2.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a triplet, the count is 1 for each tile, but if the initial has 1m, 2p, 5s, then for any triplet, count is 1 for each possible triplet.\n\nWait, no. For a triplet, the count is the number of tiles in the initial hand that match the triplet's tile. So for 1m triplet, count is 1.\n\nSo required is 2.\n\nThus, minimal is 2.\n\nBut perhaps there's a sequence that can be formed with 2p,3p,4p, but initial has only 2p. So required is 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another sequence.\n\nSo the code would find 2 as the minimal.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: initial tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m.\n\nfreq is {'1m':2, '2m':1}.\n\nTriplet for 1m: count=2, required 1.\n\nSequence for 1m,2m,3m: count is 2 (1m and 2m present). So required is 1.\n\nSo minimal is 1.\n\nThus, the code would return 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nI think this should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) from her current hand of three tiles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem Requirements**: A mentsu can be either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).

These are read and stored in a list.\n- **Frequency Dictionary**: This dictionary keeps track of how many times each tile appears in the initial hand.\n- **Triplet Check**: For each possible triplet (like '1m', '2m', etc.), we check how many of these tiles are already present and calculate how many more are needed.\n- **Sequence Check**: For each possible sequence (like '1m', '2m', '3m' in the 'm' suit), we sum the counts of each tile in the sequence and determine how many more are needed.\n- **Minimum Draws Calculation**: By iterating through all possible mentsus, we keep track of the smallest number of additional tiles needed to form any mentsu, which is our answer.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum number of draws required by considering all possible valid combinations (triplets and sequences) and leveraging the frequency count for quick lookups.",
