    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find a permutation of an array such that for every non-empty subset of indices (excluding the full set and empty set), the sum in the original array and the permuted array are different. Hmm, that's a bit tricky.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem again. We're given an array 'a' with 'n' distinct integers. We need to rearrange them into array 'b' such that for any non-empty proper subset S of the indices, the sum of elements in a at positions S is not equal to the sum in b at those same positions. And if it's impossible, we output -1.\n\nSo the key here is to ensure that for all possible non-empty subsets S (where 0 < |S| < n), the sum in 'a' is different from the sum in 'b'. \n\nWait, but how do I approach this? Because checking all possible subsets isn't feasible when n is 22 because there are 2^22-2 subsets, which is way too much. So brute-forcing is out of the question.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about the properties that array 'b' must satisfy.\n\nI remember something called \"Sidon sequences\" or \"sumset\" problems, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by ensuring that certain differences between elements are unique.\n\nWait, another angle: For each element in 'b', the position it's placed in should contribute uniquely to the subset sums. So maybe arranging the elements in a way that each new element added doesn't create a duplicate subset sum with any previous arrangement.\n\nBut how? Let's think about the order in which we place elements. Maybe adding the largest elements first could help, as their contribution would be more significant, reducing the chance of overlapping sums.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is related to the concept of a \"deterministic\" array, where each element's position affects the sum in a way that no two subsets can have the same sum in both 'a' and 'b'.\n\nWait, another thought: The sum of any subset S in 'a' and 'b' must differ. So for each subset S, sum_a(S) != sum_b(S). How can we model this?\n\nMaybe we can represent each element as contributing a unique value based on its position. For instance, if each element is multiplied by a power of 2, then each subset sum becomes a unique binary number. But since the order of elements matters, perhaps assigning each element a unique weight in the permutation.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Suppose we arrange the elements such that each element has a weight of 2^k, where k is the position in 'b'. Then, the sum for any subset S in 'b' would be the sum of the elements multiplied by their respective weights. Since all weights are powers of two, each subset sum is unique. Similarly, in 'a', the elements are arranged differently, but their weights might not be unique.\n\nWait, but in 'a', the elements are not necessarily arranged in a way that their subset sums are unique. So for this problem, perhaps the solution is to assign each element in 'b' a weight such that all the subset sums in 'b' are unique, and ensure that in 'a', no subset sum equals any in 'b'.\n\nWait, but how does that help us? Because the problem requires that for every subset S, the sum in 'a' and 'b' must differ. So, perhaps if we can make the subset sums of 'a' and 'b' completely disjoint sets, that would solve the problem.\n\nHmm, but how do we arrange 'b' so that this is the case. Maybe by choosing 'b' such that all the subset sums in 'b' are unique and none of them appear in 'a's subset sums.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a graph problem. Each element has to be placed in a certain position such that the constraints on the subset sums are satisfied.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is by considering that each position in 'b' contributes a certain weight, and the elements assigned to those positions must be chosen such that the sum of any subset in 'b' doesn't match any in 'a'.\n\nAnother idea: Since the subset sums of 'b' must all be unique, perhaps we can model 'b' as a linear combination where each element is multiplied by a distinct power of 2. This way, any subset sum in 'b' is a unique number because each element contributes a unique bit in the binary representation. But wait, the problem is that the sum in 'a' might also have some subset sums that are the same as those in 'b'.\n\nBut how can we ensure that? Let me think. If in 'a', the subset sums are not unique, but in 'b' they are, then for any subset S, sum_b(S",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find a permutation of an array such that for every non-empty proper subset of indices, the sum of elements in the original array and the permuted array are different. If it's impossible, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to ensure that the sums of all non-empty proper subsets in both arrays are unique. This can be achieved by using a greedy approach where each element is placed in a position such that its contribution to the subset sums is unique. Specifically, we use powers of 2 as weights for each position in the permuted array. This ensures that each element's contribution to any subset sum is unique, thus avoiding any overlaps with the sums from the original array.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(a[0])\n        return\n    \n    # We will create a permutation b where each element's weight is 2^k, k being the index in b.\n    # The idea is to assign each element a unique weight so that all subset sums are unique.\n    \n    # Assign elements to positions such that each position has a weight of 2^(pos), and the sum for any subset is unique.\n    # So, sort the array in descending order and place the largest elements first to minimize overlaps.\n    a_sorted = sorted(a, reverse=True)\n    \n    # Now, check if it's possible to arrange them in such a way.\n    # To do this, we can try to assign each element to a position with a unique weight.\n    # Since the weights are 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^(n-1), the total number of possible subset sums is 2^n - 2 (excluding empty and full set).\n    # For n=22, 2^22 is about 4 million, which is manageable.\n    \n    # However, the problem requires that no subset sum in a matches any in b.\n    # One way to ensure this is to have the maximum element in a not present in b, but this might not always work.\n    \n    # Alternatively, since the weights in b are unique, the subset sums in b are all unique, and we just need to make sure that none of them appear in a's subset sums.\n    \n    # But checking all subset sums is computationally expensive.
