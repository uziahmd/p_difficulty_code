Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the number of valid Morse code substrings after each step of building a string S. Hmm, let's try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that each Morse code letter is represented by a string of 1-4 characters, consisting of 0s and 1s. But not all possible combinations are valid. There are four invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So any substring in S that corresponds exactly to one of these four shouldn't be counted as a valid English letter.\n\nWait, but the problem isn't just about counting valid letters. It's about counting all possible non-empty substrings that represent some valid letter. So for each position in S, I need to look at all possible substrings starting or ending there and check if they form a valid Morse code.\n\nBut considering that m can be up to 3000, a naive approach of checking every possible substring each time would be way too slow. So I need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Maybe I can keep track of the number of valid substrings ending at each position.\n\nYes! For each character added, I can update a DP array where dp[i] represents the number of valid substrings ending at position i.\n\nHow to compute dp[i]? Well, for each new character, I look back at the previous few positions (up to 3 steps back) because Morse codes are up to 4 digits long. So for each j from i-1 down to max(0, i-3), I check if the substring s[j..i] is a valid Morse code. If it is, then I add dp[j] + 1 (the +1 is for the substring itself). Wait, no. Because dp[j] counts the number of substrings ending at j, and when we extend them to i, the new substrings would be s[j+1..i], s[j+2..i], etc., but wait, that's not quite right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the DP should represent the number of valid substrings that end at position i. So for each new character, I consider all possible lengths (1 to 4) and check if the substring is valid. Then, for each valid length l, I add the count from dp[i-l].\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So for the current position i, I look back l steps where l ranges from 1 to 4. For each l, if the substring ending at i with length l is valid, then the number of new valid substrings is dp[i - l]. So I accumulate these values for each valid l.\n\nFor example, if at position i, the substring ending here of length 2 is valid, then I add dp[i-2] to the current dp[i].\n\nSo the DP recurrence would be:\n\ndp[i] = sum over l=1 to 4, if s[i-l+1 ... i] is valid then dp[i-l]\n\nAdditionally, each valid substring contributes to the total count. So the total is the sum of all dp[i] for each i.\n\nWait, but how do I efficiently check whether a substring is valid? Because for each new character, I might have to check substrings of lengths 1, 2, 3, 4 ending at i.\n\nThe first thing I need is a way to quickly determine if a substring is a valid Morse code. Let's precompute all possible valid Morse codes. Since the invalid ones are known, perhaps it's easier to precompute a set of all valid strings.\n\nWait, the valid Morse codes are all possible 1-4 length binary strings except those four invalid ones. So the valid strings are all possible except \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\n\nSo for each possible substring, I can check if it's in this set of valid strings.\n\nBut since the maximum length is 4, the number of possible substrings to check per step is manageable.\n\nSo, for each new character, I'll look at the last 1, 2, 3, 4 characters, and for each such substring, check if it's valid. If it is, add the corresponding dp value.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Precompute all valid Morse codes. The valid codes are all binary strings of length 1-4, excluding the four given.\n\nWe can generate all possible binary strings of length 1 to 4, and then remove the four invalid ones. Alternatively, create a set containing all the valid ones.\n\n2. Initialize a DP array where dp[i] represents the number of valid substrings ending at position i.\n\n3. Also, maintain a total variable that keeps the sum of all dp[i] so far. This total is the answer after each step.\n\n4. For each new character c:\n   a. Update the string S.\n   b. For l in 1 to",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of valid Morse code substrings after each modification to a string S. Each modification appends either a dot ('0') or a dash ('1') to S. A valid Morse code substring corresponds to a valid English letter, excluding four specific invalid strings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Valid Morse Codes**: Identify all valid Morse code strings of lengths 1 to 4. These are all binary strings except \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: Use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid substrings ending at position `i`.\n3. **Update DP Array**: For each new character added to S, check all possible substrings ending at this character (of lengths 1 to 4). If a substring is valid, update the DP array by adding the count of valid substrings ending at the start of this substring.\n4. **Maintain Total Count**: Keep a running total of all valid substrings found so far, which is the answer after each modification.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n# Precompute all valid Morse codes\nvalid_codes = set()\nfor l in range(1, 5):\n    for b in ['0', '1']:\n        s = ''\n        for _ in range(l):\n            s += b\n        if s not in {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}:\n            valid_codes.add(s)\n\nm = int(input())\ns = []\ndp = [0] * (m + 1)\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, m + 1):\n    c = input().strip()\n    s.append(c)\n    current = 0\n    for l in range(1, 5):\n        if i - l < 0:\n            break\n        substr = ''.join(s[-l:])\n        if substr in valid_codes:\n            current += dp[i - l]\n            if current >= MOD:\n                current -= MOD\n    dp[i] = current % MOD\n    total = (total + current) % MOD\n    print(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Valid Morse Codes**: We generate all possible binary strings of lengths 1 to 4 and filter out the invalid ones.\n2. **DP Array Initialization**: The DP array `dp` is initialized to keep track of valid substrings ending at each position.\n3. **Processing Each Character**: For each new character, we check all possible substrings ending at this character. If a substring is valid, we update the DP value by adding the count from the position that starts this substring.\n4. **Total Count Update**: After processing each character, the total number of valid substrings is updated and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks valid substrings using dynamic programming, ensuring that each step is processed in constant time relative to the maximum substring length, making it suitable for the given constraints.",
