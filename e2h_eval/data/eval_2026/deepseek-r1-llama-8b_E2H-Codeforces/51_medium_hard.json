Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to check if the pile of letters can exactly form the two names given. Hmm, right.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again. Oh right, the input consists of three lines: guest's name, host's name, and the pile. We need to check if the pile is a rearrangement of all the letters from both names combined, without any extra letters.\n\nSo, the approach here is probably to count the frequency of each letter in the guest and host names, combine them, and then compare with the pile's letter counts.\n\nWait, yes. So steps:\n\n1. Read the three input lines.\n2. Concatenate the first two strings (guest + host) into one string.\n3. Also, create a concatenated string of the pile.\n4. For each string (the combined guest+host and the pile), count the frequency of each character.\n5. Compare these two frequency dictionaries. If they are identical, output YES; else, NO.\n\nBut wait, what about case sensitivity? The problem says all letters are uppercase, so we don't have to worry about lowercase. Great.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nI think using the collections.Counter class would be helpful here. Because it can count the occurrences of each character efficiently.\n\nSo, plan:\n\n- Read the three lines. Let's call them guest, host, pile.\n- Combine guest and host into combined = guest + host.\n- Then, create a Counter for combined.\n- Create another Counter for pile.\n- Compare the two Counters. If they are equal, output YES; else, NO.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nBut wait, what about when the lengths don't match? Because if the total number of letters in combined is different from the pile, then the Counters will automatically differ. So that's covered.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nLike when one of the strings is empty? But the problem states that all lines are not empty, so that's not an issue.\n\nAnother edge case: when guest and host together have exactly the same letters as the pile, including all counts.\n\nSo, the code structure would be something like:\n\nRead guest, host, pile.\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\ncount_combined = Counter(combined)\ncount_pile = Counter(pile)\n\nif count_combined == count_pile:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nThat's simple enough.\n\nWait, but looking at the example given:\n\nIn the first sample input, the guest is 'SANTACLAUS', the host is 'DEDMOROZ', so combined is their concatenation.\n\nThe pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nWait, let's see: combining SANTACLAUS and DEDMOROZ gives us all the letters that should be in the pile.\n\nThe pile must have exactly those letters in any order.\n\nSo the code would correctly handle that.\n\nIn the second sample, the pile is missing a 'P' and has an extra 'L'. So the Counters won't match.\n\nThird sample: extra 'L', so again the Counters differ.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, let's think about possible issues. Like, are there any constraints on the input? For example, if the guest or host names have zero length? But the problem says all lines are not empty, so no.\n\nAlso, the length of each line can be up to 100, which is manageable.\n\nSo, now I can write the code.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, wait noâ€”the actual input is three lines, each being the guest, host, and pile respectively.\n\nSo in the code, reading via standard input, perhaps using input().strip() for each line.\n\nWait, in Python, the input may come with newlines, but using splitlines() or reading each line via input().strip() might help.\n\nWait, for example, in the first sample, the guest is 'SANTACLAUS', which is the first line. So in the code:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, combined = guest + host.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\ncounter_combined = Counter(combined)\ncounter_pile = Counter(pile)\n\nif counter_combined == counter_pile:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nYes, that's straightforward.\n\nWait, but what about when the guest or host is empty? According to the problem statement, it's not possible because each line is non-empty.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the pile of letters found at the door can be rearranged to form both the guest's name and the host's name exactly. This means that the pile must contain exactly the same number of each letter as the combined names of the guest and host.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the three input lines which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names:** Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Count Frequencies:** Use a frequency counter to count the occurrences of each letter in both the combined names and the pile.\n4. **Compare Frequencies:** Check if the frequency counts of the combined names and the pile are identical. If they are, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the exact match of letters using frequency counting, which is both time-efficient and straightforward.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\ncounter_combined = Counter(combined)\ncounter_pile = Counter(pile)\n\nprint(\"YES\" if counter_combined == counter_pile else \"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The code reads three lines of input corresponding to the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n- **Combining Names:** The guest's and host's names are concatenated into a single string to form the combined string.\n- **Frequency Counting:** Using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, the code counts the frequency of each letter in both the combined string and the pile.\n- **Comparison:** The frequency counters of the combined string and the pile are compared. If they match exactly, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the names, and \"YES\" is printed. Otherwise, \"NO\" is printed.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures that the problem constraints are met with optimal performance.",
