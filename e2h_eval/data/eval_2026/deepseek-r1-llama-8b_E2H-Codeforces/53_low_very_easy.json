Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem correctly. The task is to find the maximum possible length of a substring that occurs two or more times in the input string. The occurrences can overlap. For example, in the sample input 'ababa', the substring 'aba' appears twice, overlapping each other. So the output is 3.\n\nLet me consider some examples. If the input is 'abcd', all substrings are unique, so the answer is 0. For 'zzz', the substrings 'zz' and 'zz' appear (overlapping), so the answer is 2.\n\nSo the approach is to check all possible substrings of the string, starting from the longest possible, and see if any of them appears more than once.\n\nHow do I generate all possible substrings and check their occurrences efficiently?\n\nI think I can loop through all possible lengths starting from the largest possible down to 1. For each length L, I generate all possible substrings of length L, store their positions, and then check if any substring appears again.\n\nWait, but for each L, I can iterate through the string, collect all substrings of length L, and then see if there's any duplicate. Once I find the maximum L where this is true, I can return it.\n\nBut what's the order of checking? It's better to start with the largest possible L and decrease until we find a valid one.\n\nThe steps could be:\n\n1. Iterate L from the length of the string down to 1.\n   - For each L, create a set or a dictionary to track substrings.\n   - For each position i in 0 to len(s) - L:\n       - Extract substring s[i:i+L]\n       - Check if this substring has been seen before.\n       - If yes, return L as the answer.\n       - If not, add it to the set.\n2. If no such L is found except 0, return 0.\n\nWait, but wait. How do I handle the case where multiple substrings might have duplicates but for a certain L? For example, in 'ababa', when L=3, the substrings are 'aba' (positions 0-2), 'bab' (1-3), 'aba' (2-4). So the second occurrence of 'aba' would trigger the condition, so L=3 is returned.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nFor each possible L from len(s) down to 1:\n   create a set to keep track of substrings of length L.\n   for each i in 0 to len(s)-L:\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n       if substr is already in the set:\n           return L\n       else:\n           add substr to the set\n   if after checking all i, no duplicates found, continue to L-1.\n\nIf no L >0 found, return 0.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input string. Then, loop L from len(s) down to 1.\n\nFor each L, create a set called seen_substrings.\n\nThen loop i from 0 to len(s) - L inclusive.\n\nFor each i, extract the substring s[i:i+L], check if it's in seen_substrings. If yes, return L. If not, add to the set.\n\nOnce all i's are checked for this L, proceed to the next smaller L.\n\nIf after all Ls down to 1, no duplicates found, return 0.\n\nWait, but wait: for L= len(s), the only substring is the entire string. So if len(s) is 1, like 'a', then the substring 'a' occurs once, so the answer is 0.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa'. For L=5, it's only one substring. L=4: check substrings 'aaaa' (positions 0-3 and 1-4). So when i=0, substr is 'aaaa', not in the set. Add it. Then i=1, substr is 'aaaa', which is in the set. So return 4.\n\nSo the code should correctly handle that.\n\nWhat about the case where the maximum L is not the first possible? Like, for example, in 'abcabc', the maximum L is 3, but perhaps another substring of longer length exists. But in this case, the entire string is length 6, so L starts at 6. Wait, the entire string is 'abcabc' — does it occur twice? No, because it's only once. So the next L is 5. Do any substrings of length 5 repeat? Let's see: 'bcabc' and 'cabcx' — probably not. Then",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves checking all possible substrings starting from the longest possible down to the shortest. For each length `L`, we generate all possible substrings of that length and check if any of them appear more than once. If we find such a substring, we return its length as the result. If no such substring is found for any length, we return 0.\n\n1. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: Start from the maximum possible length of the string and decrease down to 1.\n2. **Generate Substrings**: For each length `L`, generate all substrings of that length.\n3. **Check for Duplicates**: Use a set to track seen substrings. If a substring is encountered again, it means it has appeared at least twice.\n4. **Return Result**: As soon as a duplicate substring is found, return the current length `L`. If no duplicates are found for any length, return 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nmax_len = len(s)\nresult = 0\n\nfor L in range(max_len, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(len(s) - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input string is read and its length is determined.\n- **Loop Through Lengths**: We loop from the length of the string down to 1.\n- **Generate Substrings**: For each length `L`, we generate substrings starting from each position in the string.\n- **Check for Duplicates**: Each substring is checked against a set of seen substrings. If a duplicate is found, the length `L` is printed and the program exits.\n- **No Duplicates Found**: If no duplicates are found for any length, the result is 0, which is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest repeating substring by leveraging a set for quick lookups, making the solution both effective and efficient.",
