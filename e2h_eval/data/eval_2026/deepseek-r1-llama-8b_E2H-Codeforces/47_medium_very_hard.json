    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where given two integers a and b, I have to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a+k) and (b+k) is minimized. And if there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest one.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's happening when we add k to both a and b. The new numbers are a + k and b + k. But wait, since a and b could be in any order, maybe I should first compute the difference between them. Oh right, because if a is larger than b, then adding k to both doesn't change their order. Wait no, if a > b, then a +k is still bigger than b +k. So the LCM would be a +k if they are coprime, but maybe not.\n\nWait, actually, the LCM of two numbers x and y is (x*y)/GCD(x,y). So, for a +k and b +k, their GCD is important here.\n\nLet me denote d = |a - b|. Because when you add k to both, the difference remains the same as d. So the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) would be the same as the GCD of (d, (a +k) - (b +k)) which simplifies to GCD(d, a - b). Since d is fixed, the GCD depends on the difference between a and b.\n\nWait, no. Let me see: the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) is equal to the GCD of (a +k - (b +k)) and (b +k), which is GCD(a - b, b +k). But a - b could be positive or negative; the absolute value matters. So, it's GCD(d, b +k), where d is |a - b|.\n\nWait, no, because GCD is always non-negative. So yes, the GCD is GCD(d, b +k).\n\nSo, the LCM of a +k and b +k is (a +k)*(b +k) / GCD(a +k, b +k) = (a +k)(b +k) / g, where g is GCD(a +k, b +k).\n\nBut since g is GCD(d, b +k), because a +k - (b +k) = a - b, which is either d or -d, depending on which is bigger. So, regardless, the GCD is the same as GCD(d, b +k).\n\nHmm. So, the problem reduces to finding k such that GCD(d, b +k) is as large as possible, because a larger GCD would make the LCM smaller.\n\nWait, because the LCM is (a +k)(b +k)/g. If g is large, then the LCM is small. So, the optimal k is the one that maximizes g, which is GCD(d, b +k). But we also want to minimize the product (a +k)(b +k) as much as possible, but perhaps the maximum GCD is more important.\n\nWait, but sometimes even with the same g, the product might vary. So perhaps the optimal k is the one that maximizes the GCD, and among those, choose the smallest k.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|. If d is zero, then a and b are equal. So the LCM is a +k, which is minimized when k is zero. So output 0.\n\n2. Otherwise, for d > 0, we need to find k >= 0 such that GCD(d, b +k) is as large as possible, and among those k's, choose the smallest.\n\nBut wait, how do I find such k? Let's think.\n\nThe GCD of d and (b +k) is the same as the GCD of d and (b +k mod d). Because GCD(d, x) = GCD(d, x mod d). So, for each divisor g of d, we can find k such that (b +k) mod d = 0, i.e., b +k is a multiple of g.\n\nWait, no. Because for a given g that divides d, the condition is that (b +k) must be congruent to 0 mod g. So, k ≡ (-b) mod g.\n\nSo, for each divisor g of d, the minimal k is max(0, (g - (b % g)) % g). Wait, no: Let me think again. We have (b +k) mod g = 0 → k ≡ (-b) mod g → k = t * g - b mod g? Or perhaps, k needs to be such that (b +k) is divisible by g. So, k must be congruent to (-b) mod g.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to represent k as (m * g - b) mod something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible divisor g of d, we can compute the required k that makes (b +k) divisible by g. Then, among all such k's, we can find the one that gives the largest g, and the smallest k.\n\nBut since d can be up to 1e9, enumerating all divisors may be feasible, but it depends on the number of divisors. For example, 1e9 has around 100 divisors, which is manageable.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Compute d = |a - b|.\n\n- If d is zero, output 0.\n\n- Else, find all the divisors of d.\n\n- For each divisor g, compute the minimal k such that (b +k) is divisible by g. Then, compute the corresponding (a +k) and (b +k), calculate their LCM, and track the minimum.\n\nWait, but wait. Because when g is a divisor of d, and (b +k) is divisible by g, then the GCD(g, d) is g, so the GCD(a +k, b +k) is g. So the LCM is (a +k)*(b +k)/g.\n\nBut how does this help us find the minimal LCM?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible g (divisor of d), find the minimal k that makes (b +k) divisible by g, then compute the LCM and see which is the smallest.\n\nBut considering all divisors may not capture all possibilities. Because for a given g, the minimal k is (g - (b mod g)) mod g. Which could be zero if b is already divisible by g.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose d=6, so divisors are 1,2,3,6.\n\nSuppose b is 10. Then for g=2:\n\nb mod g is 0, so k=0. Then, a +k is 6+0=6, b +k is 10+0=10. LCM is 30.\n\nFor g=3:\n\nb mod 3 is 1. So k = 3 - 1 = 2. So a +k =8, b +k=12. LCM is 24.\n\nFor g=6:\n\nb mod 6 is 4. So k =6-4=2. So a +k=8, b +k=12. LCM is 24.\n\nWait, same as for g=3. So in this case, the minimal LCM is 24.\n\nBut in the sample input, when a=6, b=10, the correct k is 2, which gives LCM 24.\n\nSo, in this case, for g=3 and g=6, the k is 2, and the same LCM.\n\nSo, perhaps among all possible g's, the maximal g leads to the minimal LCM. So, the approach is to find the maximal possible g (which is a divisor of d) and then compute the minimal k for that g.\n\nWait, but in this example, the maximum possible g is 6, but the minimal k for g=6 is 2, which is the same as for g=3.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to find all possible g's, compute the corresponding k, and then among all the (g, k) pairs, select the one that gives the minimal LCM. If there are multiple, choose the smallest k.\n\nBut this might be computationally expensive for large d, but since d can be up to 1e9, but its number of divisors is manageable (like up to 1e5 for very composite numbers), it's feasible.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|.\n\n2. If d is zero, return k=0.\n\n3. Else, generate all the divisors of d.\n\n4. For each divisor g of d:\n\n   a. Compute k = (g - (b % g)) % g. Wait, no: Wait, (b +k) must be divisible by g. So, (b +k) mod g ==0 → k ≡ (-b) mod g. So, the minimal non-negative k is (g - (b mod g)) % g. Because if b mod g is zero, k is zero. Otherwise, it's g minus the remainder.\n\n   b. Compute the current a_plus_k = a + k, b_plus_k = b +k.\n\n   c. Compute the current_lcm = a_plus_k * b_plus_k // g.\n\n5. Among all possible (g, k), find the pair that gives the minimal current_lcm. If multiple, choose the smallest k.\n\nWait, but wait: How do I get all possible divisors of d?\n\nYes, but I have to find all the divisors of d. How to do that efficiently?\n\nWe can factorize d into its prime factors and then generate all possible divisors from the factors.\n\nBut factorizing a number up to 1e9 is manageable, but it's time-consuming. Alternatively, we can iterate up to sqrt(d) and collect all divisors.\n\nYes, that's better. So, for each i from 1 to sqrt(d), check if d is divisible by i. If yes, then add i and d/i to the list of divisors, making sure to avoid duplicates when d is a perfect square.\n\nOnce we have all the divisors, we can proceed.\n\nBut wait, for each divisor g, we compute k as (g - (b % g)) % g. But wait, since (b % g) is the remainder when b is divided by g, (g - (b % g)) will give the minimal positive k that makes b +k divisible by g. However, if b mod g is zero, then k is zero.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for each divisor g, compute k = (g - (b % g)) % g. Then, compute the LCM for that k.\n\nWait, but why? Because when (b +k) is divisible by g, then the GCD of (a +k, b +k) is at least g. But wait, since g is a divisor of d, which is |a -b|, then the GCD is exactly g, because:\n\nLet me see: (a +k) and (b +k) differ by d. So their GCD must divide d. So, if g is a divisor of d, then the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) is g only if (a +k) and (b +k) are multiples of g, but not a higher multiple.\n\nWait, no. Because (a +k) and (b +k) could have a higher common divisor than g. For example, suppose d=6, and g=2. Then, if a +k is 8 and b +k is 10, their GCD is 2, which is exactly g. But if a +k is 14 and b +k is 16, their GCD is 2 again. So, in that case, the GCD is exactly g.\n\nWait, but suppose d=4, and g=2. Then, a +k and b +k could be 6 and 10, whose GCD is 2. Or a +k=4 and b +k=8, GCD is 4, which is larger than g=2.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Because in that case, the GCD is larger than g, which is a divisor of d.\n\nSo, my initial assumption was wrong. The GCD could be a multiple of g.\n\nSo, for each g, which is a divisor of d, the GCD could be greater than or equal to g. But how?\n\nBecause when (a +k) and (b +k) are both multiples of some divisor of d, which is larger than g.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem.\n\nThe GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) is equal to the GCD of d and (b +k), because (a +k) - (b +k) = d.\n\nSo, GCD(a +k, b +k) = GCD(d, b +k).\n\nSo, if (b +k) is a multiple of g, then the GCD is at least g. But it could be higher if (b +k) is a multiple of a larger divisor of d.\n\nWait, for example, if d=6, and (b +k) is 12, then GCD(6,12) is 6. So, the GCD is exactly 6, which is a multiple of all its divisors.\n\nSo, for a given g (divisor of d), the actual GCD could be higher than g. Therefore, in such cases, the LCM would be smaller.\n\nThus, just considering all divisors g of d isn't sufficient. Because for a particular k, the GCD could be a multiple of g, leading to a smaller LCM.\n\nHmm, this complicates things.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach of considering all possible divisors of d isn't enough. Because for each k, the GCD could be any divisor of d, not just the ones considered.\n\nWait, but the GCD must be a divisor of d, right? Because the difference between (a +k) and (b +k) is d, so any common divisor must divide d.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the GCD can be any divisor of d.\n\nSo, the problem becomes: for each possible divisor g of d (including all possible divisors), find the minimal k that allows (b +k) to be a multiple of g, and then compute the LCM.\n\nBut wait, that's not sufficient because for a particular k, the GCD could be a larger divisor of d.\n\nWait, for example, suppose d=6, and k=2, so (b +k) is 12, which is a multiple of 6. So the GCD is 6, which is a divisor of d.\n\nSo, in this case, the maximum possible GCD is achieved when (b +k) is a multiple of the largest possible divisor of d.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal k is the one that makes (b +k) a multiple of the largest possible divisor of d.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal k is the one that makes (b +k) divisible by the largest possible divisor of d, which is d itself.\n\nWait, in the first sample input, d=4, a=6, b=10. Wait, no, wait, in the first sample, a=6, b=10: d=4? Wait, 10-6=4. So d=4. Then, the largest divisor is 4. So for g=4, the k is (4 - (10 mod4)) mod4. 10 mod4 is 2, so 4-2=2. So k=2. Then, a +k=8, b +k=12. LCM is 24.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: a=21, b=31. d=10.\n\nDivisors of 10: 1,2,5,10.\n\nFor each g:\n\ng=10: k=(10 - (31 mod10)) mod10 → 31 mod10=1 → 10-1=9. So k=9. Then, a +k=30, b +k=40. GCD is 10, LCM is 30*40/10=120.\n\ng=5: k=(5 - (31 mod5)) mod5 → 31 mod5=1 → 5-1=4. So k=4. a +k=25, b +k=35. GCD is 5, LCM is 25*35/5=175. That's worse than 120.\n\nSimilarly for g=2: k= (2 - (31 mod2)) → 31 mod2 is 1 → 2-1=1 → k=1. a +k=22, b +k=32. GCD is 2, LCM is 22*32/2=352.\n\ng=1: k=0. a=21, b=31 → LCM 21*31=651.\n\nSo, the best is g=10, k=9, LCM 120.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the approach of considering all divisors of d and choosing the one that gives the maximum g seems correct.\n\nWait, but wait another example: a=5, b=10. So d=5.\n\nDivisors are 1,5.\n\nFor g=5: k = (5 - (10 mod5)) mod5 → 10 mod5 is 0 → k=0. So a +k=5, b +k=10. LCM is 10.\n\nFor g=1: k= (1 - (10 mod1)) mod1 → 10 mod1 is 0 → k=0. Same as above.\n\nSo, the minimal LCM is 10, achieved with k=0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=7, b=15. d=8.\n\nDivisors of 8: 1,2,4,8.\n\nFor g=8: k= (8 - (15 mod8)) mod8 → 15 mod8=7 → 8-7=1. So k=1. a +k=8, b +k=16. GCD is 8, LCM is 8*16/8=16.\n\nFor g=4: k= (4 - (15 mod4)) → 15 mod4=3 → 4-3=1. So k=1. a +k=8, b +k=16 → same as above.\n\nFor g=2: k= (2 - (15 mod2)) → 15 mod2=1 → 2-1=1. So k=1. Same as before.\n\nFor g=1: k=0. a=7, b=15. LCM is 105.\n\nSo, the minimal LCM is 16, achieved with k=1.\n\nSo, in this case, the maximal g gives the minimal LCM.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to find the maximal possible g (divisor of d), and among all possible g's, compute the corresponding k and then the LCM. Then, pick the g that gives the minimal LCM, and the smallest k if there's a tie.\n\nBut wait, in the first example, for g=3 and g=6, both give the same k and same LCM. So, when multiple g's lead to the same minimal LCM, we need to pick the smallest k.\n\nWait, but in that case, the k is same for different g's. So, the approach would be to find the maximum possible g, and for that g, compute k, and that's the best option.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find the maximum possible g (divisor of d), and then compute k for that g. Because the larger the g, the higher the GCD, thus the smaller the LCM.\n\nWait, but earlier example shows that choosing a larger g can result in a smaller LCM.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to proceed is to consider all possible divisors of d, compute for each the corresponding k and the LCM, and then select the one with the smallest LCM, and if there are ties, the smallest k.\n\nBut that could be computationally heavy if d is large, but since the number of divisors is manageable, it's acceptable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Compute d = |a - b|.\n\n- If d is zero, output 0.\n\n- Else, find all the divisors of d.\n\n- For each divisor g, compute k = (g - (b % g)) % g. If b mod g is zero, then k is zero.\n\n- Compute the LCM for this k as (a +k) * (b +k) / g.\n\n- Keep track of the minimal LCM found, along with the smallest k that achieves it.\n\n- After considering all g's, output the smallest k.\n\nWait, but wait: Is the LCM computed correctly for each g?\n\nBecause when (b +k) is divisible by g, the GCD is exactly g, right?\n\nNo, because the GCD could be a multiple of g. For example, if d is 6, and g is 2, and (b +k) is 14, which is divisible by 2 but not by 6. So, the GCD is 2, which is exactly g.\n\nWait, but if (b +k) is 12, which is divisible by 6 (g=6), then the GCD is 6, which is exactly g.\n\nSo, the GCD is exactly the g that is a divisor of d, and (b +k) is divisible by g.\n\nSo, the initial approach is correct.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each g in divisors of d:\n\n   compute k = (g - (b mod g)) % g\n\n   compute lcm_val = (a +k) * (b +k) // g\n\n   keep track of the minimal lcm_val, and the smallest k.\n\nSo, the code needs to:\n\n1. Read a and b.\n\n2. Compute d = abs(a - b)\n\n3. If d is 0, print 0.\n\n4. Else, find all divisors of d.\n\n5. For each g in divisors:\n\n   compute rem = b % g\n\n   k = (g - rem) % g → to ensure it's non-negative.\n\n   compute x = a +k, y = b +k\n\n   current_gcd = g → because (y) is divisible by g, and (x - y) is d, which is divisible by g.\n\n   So, current_lcm = x * y // g.\n\n6. Among all (g, k), find the one with the smallest current_lcm. If multiple, pick the smallest k.\n\nSo, now, the question is, how to implement this in Python.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find all the divisors of d.\n\nImplementing a function to find all the divisors of a number.\n\nLet's write a helper function to get all the divisors of n.\n\nFunction get_divisors(n):\n\n   if n == 0: return empty list.\n\n   divisors = set()\n\n   for i in range 1 to sqrt(n):\n\n      if n % i ==0:\n\n         divisors.add(i)\n\n         divisors.add(n//i)\n\n   return sorted(list(divisors))\n\nBut wait, for n=0, it's handled by step 3.\n\nWait, but in our case, d can be zero only when a equals b. So, for d>0, proceed.\n\nSo, for each divisor, process as per step 5.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nd = abs(a - b)\n\nif d ==0:\n\n   print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n   find all divisors of d.\n\n   for each g in sorted(divisors, reverse=True):\n\n      rem = b % g\n\n      k = (g - rem) % g\n\n      x = a +k\n\n      y = b +k\n\n      current_lcm = (x * y) // g\n\n      compare to current minimum.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the same k could be generated by multiple g's. So, we need to consider all possible g's and track the minimal LCM and k.\n\nSo, perhaps, we can loop through all the divisors, compute the k, and for each, compute the LCM, and keep track of the minimal.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) +1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nd = abs(a - b)\n\nif d == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = None\n    for g in divisors:\n        rem = b % g\n        k = (g - rem) % g\n        x = a + k\n        y = b + k\n        current_gcd = g\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and k < best_k):\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k\n    print(best_k)\n\nWait, but wait. There's a problem with this approach. Because for some g's, the current_lcm may be the same as for other g's, but the k could be larger. So, in that case, the code would prefer the smaller k.\n\nBut in the code above, for each g, we compute k, and if the current_lcm is less than the current min, or equal but k is smaller, we update.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, what about when g is not the maximum? Like, suppose for a certain g, the current_lcm is the same as a larger g, but the k is smaller.\n\nWait, but in that case, the larger g would have been processed earlier, and the current_lcm would have been set to a smaller value. So, the code would have updated min_lcm and best_k accordingly.\n\nWait, but perhaps the code is not processing the divisors in a specific order. For example, in the case where two different g's lead to the same minimal LCM but different k's, the code should pick the smallest k.\n\nIn the code above, since for each g, we compute k, and if the current_lcm is equal to the min, but k is smaller, then we update.\n\nSo, for example, if the first g processed is 3, giving k=2, and later, a g=6 also gives k=2, the code will not update best_k because k is same. So, it's correct.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, when a=6, b=10, d=4.\n\nThe divisors are 1, 2,4.\n\nProcessing in order 4, 2, 1.\n\nFor g=4: rem = 10 mod4=2 → k=4-2=2.\n\nCompute x=8, y=12 → LCM 24.\n\nSet min_lcm=24, best_k=2.\n\nThen, process g=2: rem=10 mod2=0 → k=0.\n\nx=6, y=10 → LCM 30. 30>24 → no update.\n\nProcess g=1: k=0 → same as above.\n\nSo, the code correctly selects k=2.\n\nAnother example: a=5, b=10.\n\nd=5.\n\ndivisors are 1,5.\n\nprocess g=5 first.\n\nrem=10 mod5=0 → k=0.\n\nx=5, y=10 → LCM 10.\n\nthen g=1: rem=0 → k=0. same as above.\n\nSo, the code picks k=0.\n\nAnother example: a=7, b=15. d=8.\n\ndivisors are 1,2,4,8.\n\nprocessing g=8:\n\nrem=15 mod8=7 → k=1.\n\nx=8, y=16 → LCM 16.\n\nthen g=4: rem=15 mod4=3 → k=1. x=8, y=16 → same as above.\n\ng=2: rem=15 mod2=1 → k=1.\n\ng=1: k=0. x=7, y=15 → LCM 105.\n\nSo, the code will process g=8 first, set min_lcm=16, best_k=1.\n\nOther g's will not change this.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nWait, but what about a case where the maximum g does not give the minimal LCM?\n\nIs that possible?\n\nHmm. Let's think of a case where for a certain g, the LCM is lower than for the maximum g.\n\nWait, suppose d=6, a=4, b=10.\n\nSo, d=6.\n\ndivisors are 1,2,3,6.\n\nfor g=6: rem=10 mod6=4 → k=6-4=2.\n\nx=6, y=12 → LCM 6*12/6=12.\n\nfor g=3: rem=10 mod3=1 → k=2. x=6, y=12 → same as above.\n\nfor g=2: rem=10 mod2=0 → k=0. x=4, y=10 → LCM 20.\n\nfor g=1: k=0 → x=4, y=10 → LCM 20.\n\nSo, the maximum g is 6, which gives k=2, LCM 12.\n\nWhich is better than other options.\n\nAnother example: a=9, b=15.\n\nd=6.\n\ng=6: rem=15 mod6=3 →k=3.\n\nx=12, y=18 → LCM 36.\n\ng=3: rem=15 mod3=0 →k=0.\n\nx=9, y=15 → LCM 45.\n\nSo, in this case, the maximum g gives a lower LCM.\n\nAnother example: a=12, b=18.\n\nd=6.\n\ng=6: rem=18 mod6=0 →k=0.\n\nx=12, y=18 → LCM 36.\n\ng=3: rem=18 mod3=0 →k=0.\n\nx=12, y=18 → same as above.\n\ng=2: rem=18 mod2=0 →k=0.\n\nx=12, y=18 → same.\n\ng=1: same.\n\nSo, all g's give k=0, and the LCM is 36.\n\nSo, the code correctly picks k=0.\n\nHmm, but what about a case where a larger g does not give the minimal LCM.\n\nWait, let's say d=12.\n\ndivisors are 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\nSuppose a=13, b=25. d=12.\n\nFor g=12: rem=25 mod12=1 →k=11.\n\nx=13+11=24, y=25+11=36.\n\nLCM is (24*36)/12 = 72.\n\nFor g=6: rem=25 mod6=1 →k=5.\n\nx=18, y=30 → LCM (18*30)/6=90.\n\nFor g=4: rem=25 mod4=1 →k=3.\n\nx=16, y=28 → LCM (16*28)/4= 112.\n\nFor g=3: rem=25 mod3=1 →k=2.\n\nx=15, y=27 → LCM 135.\n\nFor g=2: rem=25 mod2=1 →k=1.\n\nx=14, y=26 → LCM 182.\n\nFor g=1: k=0. x=13, y=25 → LCM 325.\n\nSo, the minimal LCM is 72, achieved by g=12, k=11.\n\nSo, the code correctly selects k=11.\n\nBut wait, what if there's a g that is not the maximum, but gives a better LCM?\n\nI can't think of such a case. Because the larger the g, the higher the GCD, thus the smaller the LCM.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is correct.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's try to find a counterexample.\n\nSuppose d=12, a=17, b=29.\n\nd=12.\n\ndivisors: 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\nfor g=12:\n\nrem=29 mod12=5 →k=7.\n\nx=17+7=24, y=29+7=36.\n\nlcm= (24*36)/12=72.\n\ng=6:\n\nrem=29 mod6=5 →k=1.\n\nx=18, y=30 → lcm= 18*30/6=90.\n\ng=4: rem=29 mod4=1 →k=3.\n\nx=20, y=32 → lcm 20*32 /4= 160.\n\ng=3: rem=29 mod3=2 →k=1.\n\nx=18, y=30 → lcm 90.\n\ng=2: rem=29 mod2=1 →k=1.\n\nx=18, y=30 → same as g=6.\n\ng=1: k=0 → x=17, y=29 → lcm 493.\n\nSo, the minimal is 72, achieved by g=12, k=7.\n\nSo, no counterexample found.\n\nAnother test case: a=14, b=28.\n\nd=14.\n\ndivisors:1,2,7,14.\n\nfor g=14: rem=28 mod14=0 →k=0.\n\nx=14, y=28 → lcm=28.\n\ng=7: rem=28 mod7=0 →k=0.\n\nx=14, y=28 → lcm=28.\n\ng=2: rem=28 mod2=0 →k=0 → lcm=28.\n\ng=1: k=0.\n\nSo, all g's give same lcm, but the code will choose k=0, which is correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: a=1, b=1e9.\n\nd=999999999.\n\nWe need to find the divisor of d which is as large as possible. So, the code will compute k for g=d, which is the maximum.\n\nSo, rem = 1e9 mod d → since 1e9 = d ×1 + 0 → rem=0.\n\nSo, k=0.\n\nx=1, y=1e9 → lcm is 1e9.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=4.\n\nd=2.\n\ndivisors:1,2.\n\ng=2: rem=4 mod2=0 →k=0.\n\nx=2, y=4 → lcm=4.\n\ng=1: k=0. x=2, y=4 → same.\n\nSo, code picks k=0.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b=5.\n\nd=2.\n\ndivisors:1,2.\n\ng=2: rem=5 mod2=1 →k=1.\n\nx=4, y=6 → lcm=12.\n\ng=1: k=0 → x=3, y=5 → lcm 15.\n\nSo, the minimal is 12, achieved by k=1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases correctly.\n\nNow, considering the code:\n\nIt computes all divisors of d, then for each, computes k, and then the LCM.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the divisors are sorted in ascending order. So, for the code, the loop processes g in increasing order.\n\nBut in the first sample, the code would process g=1, then g=2, then g=4, etc.\n\nBut for each g, it's checking if the current LCM is less than the current min, or same but with a smaller k.\n\nSo, the order in which the divisors are processed shouldn't matter because all possibilities are considered.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to process the largest g first, as the larger g's are more likely to give a better (smaller) LCM.\n\nBut in the code, the divisors are returned as a sorted list, which is in increasing order. So, for example, for d=6, the divisors are [1,2,3,6].\n\nProcessing them in the order 1,2,3,6.\n\nSo, for g=1, k=0, LCM is 30.\n\nFor g=2, k=0, LCM is 30.\n\nWait, no, in the first sample, a=6, b=10.\n\nFor g=2:\n\nrem=10 mod2=0 →k=0.\n\nx=6, y=10 → LCM 30.\n\nThen, for g=3:\n\nrem=10 mod3=1 →k=2.\n\nx=8, y=12 → LCM 24.\n\nThen, for g=6:\n\nrem=10 mod6=4 →k=2.\n\nx=8, y=12 → same as above.\n\nSo, the code would process g=1, then 2, then 3, then6.\n\nSo, the first time, min_lcm is 30.\n\nWhen processing g=3, it's 24, which is less than 30, so min_lcm becomes 24, best_k=2.\n\nThen, processing g=6, k is 2, same as current best_k, same lcm. So, no change.\n\nSo, the",

If there are multiple values of \\( k \\) that yield the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key insight is that the difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), denoted as \\( d \\), plays a crucial role in determining the LCM. The LCM of two numbers can be minimized by maximizing their greatest common divisor (GCD). Therefore, we need to explore all possible divisors of \\( d \\) to find the optimal \\( k \\).\n\n2. **Divisors Calculation**: Compute all divisors of \\( d \\).

Track the minimum LCM found and the smallest \\( k \\) that achieves it.\n\n4. **Optimization**: By iterating through all divisors of \\( d \\) and computing the necessary \\( k \\) for each, we ensure that we find the optimal solution efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nd = abs(a - b)\n\nif d == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = None\n    for g in divisors:\n        rem = b % g\n        k = (g - rem) % g\n        x = a + k\n        y = b + k\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // g\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and k < best_k):\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k\n    print(best_k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Divisors Calculation**: The function `get_divisors` computes all divisors of \\( d \\) by iterating up to the square root of \\( d \\) and adding both the divisor and its complement.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Divisors**: For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( d \\), compute the smallest \\( k \\) such that \\( b + k \\) is divisible by \\( g \\). This \\( k \\) is calculated as \\( (g - (b \\% g)) \\% g \\).\n\n3. **Compute LCM**: For each \\( k \\), compute the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) using the formula \\( \\text{LCM}(x, y) = \\frac{x \\times y}{\\text{GCD}(x, y)} \\). Here, the GCD is guaranteed to be \\( g \\) because \\( g \\) is a divisor of \\( d \\).\n\n4. **Track Minimum LCM**: Keep track of the minimum LCM found and the corresponding smallest \\( k \\). If multiple \\( k \\) values yield the same LCM, the smallest \\( k \\) is chosen.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal \\( k \\) by leveraging the properties of divisors and the relationship between LCM and GCD.",
