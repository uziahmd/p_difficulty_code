She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Luba is trying to close some tabs in her browser. Hmm, let me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo, the setup is that she has n tabs open, from 1 to n. The cursor starts at position pos. She needs to keep the tabs from l to r and close all others. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right, but only within the current available tabs. Or she can close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum number of seconds needed to achieve this.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. It seems like a problem where we need to calculate the steps required to position the cursor in such a way that closing all unwanted tabs is efficient.\n\nFirst, I should figure out which tabs are outside the range [l, r]. Those are the ones to the left of l and to the right of r.\n\nSo, the initial state has all tabs open. We need to close all tabs less than l and greater than r.\n\nWait, but when you close tabs, the a and b (the min and max of unclosed tabs) change. So after each close operation, the available tabs shrink, which affects the movement options.\n\nHmm. So, the strategy would involve:\n\n1. Move the cursor to a position where you can close either the left or right tabs efficiently.\n2. Close those tabs.\n3. Then, maybe move to another position to close the remaining tabs.\n4. Ensure that the movement steps are minimized.\n\nLet's break it down into cases.\n\nCase 1: There are no tabs to close on the left or right. That is, if l=1 and r=n, then nothing needs to be done. So the answer is zero.\n\nCase 2: Only left or only right tabs need to be closed.\n\nFor example, if l=1, then we only need to close the right side. Similarly, if r=n, only the left needs to be closed.\n\nIn these cases, we can compute the steps as follows:\n\nIf we need to close the left, the cursor must be moved to position l, then close. But wait, what if the cursor is already to the right of l? Because once we close the left, the a becomes l.\n\nWait, no. Let's say initially, the cursor is at pos. If we need to close the left, then the cursor must be at a position >= l, because after moving, the left close will affect all tabs before the current cursor. Wait, no. Wait, the close operation closes all tabs to the left of the cursor. So for example, if the cursor is at position i, closing the left will close tabs 1 to i-1. So, to close the left part, the cursor needs to be at least at l+1, because closing at l would close up to l-1, which is less than l. No, wait, if the cursor is at l, then closing the left would close all tabs to the left of l. But since l is the start of the desired range, those are the ones we don't want to close. Wait, no—wait, l is the starting point of the desired segment. So any tabs before l are to be closed. So to close the left, the cursor needs to be at l, because closing the left of l would close all tabs less than l. So, for example, if l is 2, and the cursor is at 2, closing left would remove all tabs 1.\n\nBut if the cursor is at 3, closing left would remove tabs 1 and 2, which is exactly what we want. So, in that case, perhaps it's more efficient to move to a higher position first.\n\nSo, to close the left, the cursor must be at a position >= l, and then perform a left close. Similarly, to close the right, the cursor must be at a position <= r, and then perform a right close.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Determine which tabs to the left and right of the desired [l, r] range need to be closed.\n\n- For each of these, calculate the minimal steps required to reach a position where a close operation can be performed, then perform the close.\n\n- Sum these steps, along with the time taken to move between positions.\n\nSo, let's formalize the steps.\n\nFirst, identify whether we need to close the left, the right, both, or neither.\n\nIf neither, output 0.\n\nElse, for each direction (left and/or right), compute the steps needed.\n\nLet me model the steps:\n\nSuppose we have to close the left and the right.\n\nWe need to find the order of operations that minimizes the total steps.\n\nOption 1: Close left first, then close right.\n\nOption 2: Close right first, then close left.\n\nCompute the steps for each option and choose the smaller one.\n\nSimilarly,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] in her browser. The solution involves calculating the optimal steps to position the cursor and perform the necessary close operations.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Need for Closing Tabs**: Determine if there are tabs to the left of l or to the right of r that need to be closed.\n2. **Calculate Steps for Each Direction**: For each direction (left and right), compute the steps required to move the cursor to a position where a close operation can be performed.\n3. **Evaluate Both Closing Orders**: Consider both possible orders of closing (left first then right, or right first then left) and choose the one with fewer total steps.\n4. **Sum the Steps**: Sum the steps for each direction and any intermediate movements to get the total minimum steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Initialize variables to track which sides need to be closed\nneed_left = False\nneed_right = False\n\nif l > 1:\n    need_left = True\nif r < n:\n    need_right = True\n\nif not need_left and not need_right:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Compute steps for left and right\n    left_steps = 0\n    right_steps = 0\n\n    if need_left:\n        # To close left, we need to reach a position >= l\n        current_pos = pos\n        # Move from current_pos to l\n        move_steps = abs(current_pos - l)\n        left_steps += move_steps + 1  # +1 for the close operation\n        current_pos = l\n\n    if need_right:\n        # To close right, we need to reach a position <= r\n        current_pos = pos\n        # Move from current_pos to r\n        move_steps = abs(current_pos - r)\n        right_steps += move_steps + 1  # +1 for the close operation\n        current_pos = r\n\n    # Now, decide the order of closing\n    total = 0\n    if need_left and need_right:\n        # Option 1: Close left first\n        option1 = left_steps + right_steps\n        # Option 2: Close right first\n        option2 = right_steps + left_steps\n        total = min(option1, option2)\n    elif need_left:\n        total = left_steps\n    else:\n        total = right_steps\n\n    print(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Identify Closing Needs**: Check if there are tabs to the left of `l` and/or right of `r` that need closing.\n2. **Movement Calculation**: Calculate the steps needed to move the cursor to the required positions for closing.\n3. **Close Operations**: Each close operation takes an additional step, so add 1 for each close.\n4. **Optimal Order**: Evaluate both possible orders of closing (left first or right first) and choose the one with fewer steps.\n5. **Output Result**: Print the total minimum steps required.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimal steps by considering all necessary movements and operations, providing an optimal solution for the given problem.",
