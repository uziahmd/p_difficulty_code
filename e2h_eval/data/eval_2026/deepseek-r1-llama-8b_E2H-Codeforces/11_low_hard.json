A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain resources: drink, lime slices, and salt. I need to calculate the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given the available resources.\n\nLet's break down the input variables:\n\n- n: number of friends\n- k: number of bottles of drink\n- l: milliliters per bottle\n- c: number of limes cut into slices\n- d: slices per lime, so total slices are c * d\n- p: grams of salt\n- nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast per friend\n- np: grams of salt needed per toast per friend\n\nEach toast for all friends requires each person to have their own set. So, for one toast, each friend needs nl ml, one slice, and np grams.\n\nSo, let's think about the total resources required for a certain number of toasts, say t.\n\n1. Drink: For each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So total drink required is n * t * nl. We have k * l ml available. So the maximum t allowed by drink is (k * l) // (n * nl).\n\n2. Lime slices: Each toast uses one slice per friend. So for t toasts, each friend uses t slices. So total slices needed is n * t. The total available is c * d. So max t from limes is (c * d) // n.\n\n3. Salt: Each toast requires np grams per friend. So total salt needed is n * t * np. Available salt is p. So t is p // (n * np).\n\nThe maximum t is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no. Because in the note, the first sample says that the drink allows 6 toasts (20ml /3 =6), but since there are 3 friends, each can only make 2 toasts. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the calculation.\n\nWait, the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts, but then it's divided by 3 friends, giving 2 toasts each. Oh right, because each toast requires per friend, so the total per toast across all friends is n * nl. So the drink's total is k*l, and the per toast is n*nl. So the maximum toasts is (k*l) // (n * nl). Similarly for the other resources.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate the maximum possible toasts based on drink: (k * l) // (n * nl).\n2. Based on lime slices: (c * d) // n.\n3. Based on salt: p // (n * np).\n4. The actual maximum toasts is the minimum of these three numbers.\n\nThen, the result is that minimum value.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read the input as integers.\n- Compute each resource's limit.\n- The answer is the minimum of those limits.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nFor example, when any of the resources are zero, but according to the problem statement, all inputs are positive integers. So we don't need to handle zeros.\n\nAnother case: when one of the resources is exactly enough for an integer number of toasts, and others are higher or lower.\n\nFor example, if drink allows 5 toasts, limes allow 4, salt allows 5. Then the min is 4.\n\nAnother case: when any division results in a fraction, we take the floor.\n\nSo in code, I'll compute each component as integer division.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute drink_toast = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlime_toast = (c * d) // n\nsalt_toast = p // (n * np)\n\nmax_toasts = min(drink_toast, lime_toast, salt_toast)\n\nPrint max_toasts as a string.\n\nTesting with the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → 4*5=20\ndrink_toast = 20 / (3*3) = 20/9 → 2 (since 2*9=18 <=20)\nWait, wait wait. Wait, no. Wait, wait, wait. Let me re-calculate.\n\nWait, each toast requires each friend to have nl ml. So per toast, the total drink needed is n * nl. So the total drink is k*l, so the maximum toasts is (k*l) // (",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Resources**: Each toast requires:\n   - `nl` milliliters of drink per friend.\n   - 1 lime slice per friend.\n   - `np` grams of salt per friend.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**:\n   - **Drink**: The total amount of drink available is `k * l` milliliters. The number of toasts possible from the drink is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n   - **Lime Slices**: The total number of lime slices is `c * d`. Each toast requires one slice per friend, so the number of toasts possible from lime slices is `(c * d) // n`.\n   - **Salt**: The total amount of salt available is `p` grams. Each toast requires `np` grams per friend, so the number of toasts possible from salt is `p // (n * np)`.\n\n3. **Determine Maximum Toasts**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum of the three calculated values above.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ndrink_toast = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlime_toast = (c * d) // n\nsalt_toast = p // (n * np)\n\nmax_toasts = min(drink_toast, lime_toast, salt_toast)\nprint(max_toasts)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input values are read and parsed into respective variables.\n- **Calculating Drink Capacity**: The total drink available is divided by the amount needed per toast per friend to get the maximum number of toasts possible from the drink.\n- **Calculating Lime Capacity**: The total number of lime slices is divided by the number of friends to get the maximum number of toasts possible from lime slices.\n- **Calculating Salt Capacity**: The total salt available is divided by the amount needed per toast per friend to get the maximum number of toasts possible from salt.\n- **Finding Minimum Toasts**: The minimum value among the three calculated capacities gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring all friends can toast the same number of times without running out of any resource.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution using basic arithmetic operations and ensures that all constraints are respected.",
