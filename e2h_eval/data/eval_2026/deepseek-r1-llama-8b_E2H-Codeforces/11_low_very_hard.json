A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain resources: drink, lime slices, and salt. I need to calculate the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given the available resources.\n\nLet's break down the problem.\n\nWe have n friends. They bought k bottles of soft drink. Each bottle has l milliliters. So total drink is k * l ml.\n\nThey also have c limes, each cut into d slices. So total lime slices are c * d.\n\nSalt is p grams.\n\nEach toast per friend needs nl milliliters of drink, one slice of lime, and np grams of salt.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, for each toast, each friend needs those. So for each toast, all friends do it together. So for one toast round, each friend consumes nl ml of drink, one slice, and np grams of salt.\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Let me re-read.\n\nThe problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\" So for each toast, each friend uses these amounts. So for one toast (like, one round where everyone drinks), each friend uses that amount. So the total per toast is n * (nl) drink, n * 1 slice, and n * np salt.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no, because if there are n friends, then for each toast, each of them makes one toast, so for each toast:\n\n- Total drink used: n * nl\n- Total lime slices used: n * 1\n- Total salt used: n * np\n\nSo for t toasts, the total resources used would be:\n\ndrink_used = t * n * nl\nlime_used = t * n\nsalt_used = t * n * np\n\nThese must be <= the total resources.\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\nt * n * nl <= total_drink\nt * n <= total_lime\nt * n * np <= total_salt\n\nSo to find the maximum t such that all three inequalities are satisfied.\n\nBut wait, what if any of the resources are insufficient? Then t is limited by the smallest possible value.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Calculate total_drink = k * l\n2. Calculate total_lime = c * d\n3. Calculate total_salt = p\n4. For each resource, compute how many toasts t is possible considering only that resource.\n\nThen, the minimum of these three t's is the answer.\n\nWait, but each of these t's is for the entire group. Because each toast involves all n friends.\n\nSo let's think about each resource:\n\nFor drink: total_drink >= t * n * nl → t ≤ (total_drink) / (n * nl)\nFor lime: total_lime >= t * n → t ≤ (total_lime) / n\nFor salt: total_salt >= t * n * np → t ≤ (total_salt) / (n * np)\n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum of these three values.\n\nBut wait, since t has to be an integer, we take the floor of each division and then take the minimum.\n\nSo steps in code:\n\n- Read the input: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntotal_lime = c * d\ntotal_salt = p\n\nCompute for each resource:\n\ndrink_toast_limit = total_drink // (n * nl)\nlime_toast_limit = total_lime // n\nsalt_toast_limit = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nThen, the maximum possible t is the minimum of these three values.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input:\n\nFirst case: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\ntotal_drink =4*5=20\nnl=3, n=3 → 3*3=9 per toast. 20 /9 is 2.222, so 2.\n\ntotal_lime=10*8=80 → 80/3 is 26.666 → 26.\n\nsalt: p=100, np=1 → 100/(3*1)=33.333 →33.\n\nThe minimum is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\ntotal_drink=100*10=1000\nnl=4, n=5 → 20 per toast. 1000/20=50.\n\nlime: c*d=1*19=19. 19 /5 is 3.8 →3.\n\nsalt: 90/(5*3)=6 →6.\n\nThe minimum is 3.\n\nThird sample: '10 1000 1000 25 ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem Requirements**: Each friend needs a fixed amount of drink, one lime slice, and a fixed amount of salt per toast. We need to calculate the maximum number of such toasts that can be made given the resources.\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available.\n3. **Determine Resource Limits**: For each resource, compute how many toasts can be made considering only that resource. This involves dividing the total resource by the amount required per toast round (considering all friends).\n4. **Find the Minimum Toasts**: The maximum number of toasts is constrained by the resource that runs out first. Thus, the answer is the minimum of the values computed from each resource.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntotal_lime = c * d\ntotal_salt = p\n\ndrink_limit = total_drink // (n * nl)\nlime_limit = total_lime // n\nsalt_limit = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nmax_toasts = min(drink_limit, lime_limit, salt_limit)\n\nprint(max_toasts)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read and parsed into respective variables.\n2. **Total Resources Calculation**: \n   - `total_drink` is calculated as the product of the number of bottles (`k`) and the volume per bottle (`l`).\n   - `total_lime` is the product of the number of limes (`c`) and the number of slices per lime (`d`).\n   - `total_salt` is directly taken from the input value `p`.\n3. **Resource Limits Calculation**:\n   - `drink_limit` is the maximum number of toasts possible based on the drink available, considering each friend's requirement.\n   - `lime_limit` is the maximum number of toasts possible based on the lime slices available, considering each friend's requirement.\n   - `salt_limit` is the maximum number of toasts possible based on the salt available, considering each friend's requirement.\n4. **Determine Maximum Toasts**: The minimum of the three limits (`drink_limit`, `lime_limit`, `salt_limit`) is the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, as it is constrained by the first resource to run out.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum number of toasts while respecting all constraints, providing an optimal solution to the problem.",
