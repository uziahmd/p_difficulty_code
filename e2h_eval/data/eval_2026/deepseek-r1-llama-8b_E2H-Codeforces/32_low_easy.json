Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. First, I need to understand what happens when we remove each element. For each element, I can compute what the new max and min would be in the remaining array, then calculate the instability and find the minimum among all these possibilities.\n\nBut wait, considering that n can be up to 1e5, iterating through each element and for each, checking the max and min of the remaining elements would be too slow. Because for each element, finding the max and min could take O(n) time, leading to O(n^2), which won't work for 1e5 elements.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way. Let's see. Maybe precompute some structures.\n\nWhat if I sort the array first? Sorting will help because the min and max of the sorted array are at the ends. Then, when I remove an element, I can quickly find the next min and max.\n\nWait, but the original array might not be sorted. So perhaps I should first sort it, and then figure out how removing each element affects the min and max.\n\nWait, but the original array isn't necessarily sorted. So the min and max could be any elements. So sorting might complicate things because when you remove an element, the new min or max could come from elsewhere.\n\nHmm, maybe I can precompute the original min and max, and then for each element, see if it's the current min or max, and then compute the new min and max accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal instability is achieved by either removing the current maximum or the current minimum. Because those are the ones contributing most to the instability.\n\nWait, let's think about the initial instability. It's max(a) - min(a). When we remove an element, the new instability could be less than this.\n\nIf the element removed is either the current max or the current min, then the new max or min might be the second max or second min.\n\nFor example, if I remove the max, the new max becomes the second max. Similarly, if I remove the min, the new min becomes the second min. In both cases, the new instability is (second max - min) or (max - second min).\n\nAlternatively, if I remove a middle element, then the max and min remain the same as the original, so the instability remains the same as before.\n\nWait, no. If the array has multiple elements with the same min or max, then even if I remove one, the min or max doesn't change. So for example, if the array has [1, 1, 3, 7], the min is 1, and there are two 1s. Removing one 1 doesn't change the min. So the new instability is max(a without that 1) - new min.\n\nIn this case, the new max is still 7, and the new min is 1, so instability remains 6.\n\nBut if the array is [1, 3, 3, 7], like in the first example, removing 7 reduces the max to 3, so the new instability is 3-1=2.\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\n1. Find the current max and min of the array.\n2. For each element, consider removing it and compute the new max and min.\n3. Keep track of the minimal instability found.\n\nBut doing this naively for each element is O(n^2), which is too slow.\n\nSo I need a way to compute, for each element, the new max and min efficiently.\n\nLet me think: the new max is either the same as the original max (if the removed element wasn't the max) or the second max (if the removed element was the max). Similarly for the new min.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Precompute the first and second max, and the first and second min of the array.\n\nThen, for each element:\n\nCase 1: the element is the max.\n\n   Then, the new max is the second max.\n\n   The new min remains the same as the original min, unless the second max is somehow the min, which can't happen because the min is less than or equal to all other elements.\n\nWait, no. Wait, suppose the array is [5, 5, 5]. Removing one 5, the new array is [5,5], max is 5, min is 5.\n\nBut in general, when you remove the max, the new max is the second max. The min may not change.\n\nSo, for each element, if it's the original max, then new_max_candidate = second_max.\n\nSimilarly, if the element is the original min, then new_min_candidate = second_min.\n\nWait, but what if the element is neither max nor min",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Key Values**: First, we find the maximum (max_val) and minimum (min_val) values of the array.\n2. **Track Second Max and Min**: To efficiently compute the new max and min when each element is removed, we also track the second maximum (second_max) and second minimum (second_min) values.\n3. **Evaluate Each Element Removal**: For each element in the array:\n   - If the element is the current max_val, the new max will be the second_max, and the new min remains min_val.\n   - If the element is the current min_val, the new min will be the second_min, and the new max remains max_val.\n   - If the element is neither max_val nor min_val, the new max and min remain unchanged.\n4. **Calculate Instability**: Compute the instability for each scenario and keep track of the minimum instability found.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the effect of removing each element without repeatedly scanning the entire array, thus optimizing the solution to run in linear time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, *rest = map(int, open(0).read().split())\na = rest[:n]\n\nif n == 1:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    current_max = max(a)\n    current_min = min(a)\n    # Find indices or count occurrences?\n    # For elements that are not unique, we need to know if removing one still leaves others\n    # So, count how many times max appears\n    count_max = a.count(current_max)\n    count_min = a.count(current_min)\n    \n    # Now, find the second max and second min\n    # To find second max, iterate through the array and find the next max after current_max\n    second_max = -float('inf')\n    has_second_max = False\n    for num in a:\n        if num != current_max:\n            if num > second_max:\n                second_max = num\n                has_second_max = True\n    \n    # Similarly for second min\n    second_min = float('inf')\n    has_second_min = False\n    for num in a:\n        if num != current_min:\n            if num < second_min:\n                second_min = num\n                has_second_min = True\n    \n    min_instability = float('inf')\n    \n    # Now, check each possibility\n    for num in a:\n        if num == current_max:\n            if count_max > 1:\n                # There are other max elements, so new max is still current_max\n                new_max = current_max\n            else:\n                new_max = second_max\n            \n            new_min = current_min\n            inst = new_max - new_min\n            if inst < min_instability:\n                min_instability = inst\n        elif num == current_min:\n            if count_min > 1:\n                new_min = current_min\n            else:\n                new_min = second_min\n            new_max = current_max\n            inst = new_max - new_min\n            if inst < min_instability:\n                min_instability = inst\n        else:\n            # Check if removing this element affects max or min\n            # If there are multiple max or min, it's already handled\n            # Else, since it's not max or min, removing it won't change max or min\n            inst = current_max - current_min\n            if inst < min_instability:\n                min_instability = inst\n    \n    print(min_instability)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Finding Key Values**: We first determine the maximum and minimum values of the array and their counts.\n- **Second Max and Min**: We then find the second highest and lowest values to handle cases where the removed element is the only max or min.\n- **Element Removal Evaluation**: For each element, we evaluate the effect of its removal on the max and min values, updating the minimum instability accordingly.\n- **Efficiency**: This approach ensures that each element is processed in constant time after initial setup, making the solution efficient even for large arrays.",
