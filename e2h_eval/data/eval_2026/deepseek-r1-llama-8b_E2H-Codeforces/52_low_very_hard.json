Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Vasily has some candles and can make new ones from the leftover stubs. The goal is to find out how many hours he can keep the room lit. Hmm.\n\nLet me read the problem again. So, initially, he has 'a' candles. Each candle burns for exactly 1 hour and then becomes a stub. He can take 'b' stubs and make a new candle. This new candle also burns for an hour. The process continues until he doesn't have enough stubs to make a new candle anymore.\n\nSo, the idea is to calculate the total hours by considering both the initial candles and the new ones made from the stubs.\n\nLet's think about the example given. For input 4 and 2:\n\n- He starts with 4 candles. They burn for 4 hours, leaving 4 stubs.\n- He can make 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. Those burn for 2 hours, adding to the total. Now, he has 2 stubs left (from the 2 new candles).\n- He can make 1 more candle (since 2/2=1). That burns for 1 hour, adding another. Now, he has 1 stub, which isn't enough to make another candle because b is 2.\n- So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 hours. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: 6 3.\n\n- 6 initial candles → 6 hours, 6 stubs.\n- 6 /3 = 2 new candles → 2 hours, 2 stubs remain.\n- 2/3 is less than 1, so no more candles. Total is 6+2=8 hours.\n\nSo the approach seems to be:\n\n1. Start with total_hours = a.\n2. Calculate the number of new candles possible from the stubs. This is done by taking the current stub count, dividing by b, and adding that to total_hours.\n3. But each time we make new candles, we also get stubs from them, so we add those to the stub count.\n4. Repeat until the stub count is less than b.\n\nWait, but in the first example, after burning 4, we have 4 stubs. We make 2 candles, which give us 2 stubs. Then, from 2 stubs, we make 1 candle, which gives 1 stub. So the stubs are 4 → 2 → 1.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- total = a\n- stubs = a\n- while stubs >= b:\n    new_candles = stubs // b\n    total += new_candles\n    stubs = (stubs % b) + new_candles\n- return total\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because each new candle when burned adds one stub. So the new stubs are the remainder of the division plus the new candles made.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward. Let's see how to implement this in Python.\n\nWe'll read two integers, a and b.\n\nThen, initialize total as a, and stubs as a.\n\nThen, loop while stubs >= b:\n\n- compute new_candles as stubs // b.\n- add new_candles to total.\n- compute new_stubs as (stubs % b) + new_candles.\n- set stubs = new_stubs.\n\nRepeat until stubs < b.\n\nThat's simple enough.\n\nTesting it on the samples.\n\nSample 1: a=4, b=2.\n\ntotal =4, stubs=4.\n\nLoop:\n\nstubs >=2 → yes.\n\nnew_candles =4//2=2. total becomes 6.\n\nstubs =4%2=0 +2=2.\n\nAgain, stubs >=2 → yes.\n\nnew_candles=2//2=1. total 7.\n\nstubs=0 +1=1. Now, stubs <2 → loop ends.\n\nTotal is 7. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal=6, stubs=6.\n\nLoop:\n\n6 >=3 → new_candles=2. total 8. stubs=0+2=2.\n\nNow, 2 <3 → loop ends. So total is 8. Correct.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where a is 0? But according to input constraints, a is at least 1, so no.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=5.\n\nInitial: total=5, stubs=5.\n\nstubs >=5 → new_candles=1. total 6.\n\nstubs =0 +1=1 → loop ends. So total is 6.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=2.\n\nBurn 2 → stubs 2.\n\nMake 1 new candle. Burn → stubs 1. So total is 3.\n\nWhich the code would compute",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the given candles and the stubs from burned-out candles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles `a`. Each candle burns for exactly 1 hour and then becomes a stub.\n2. **Recycle Stubs**: Convert the stubs into new candles by using the given ratio `b` (where `b` stubs make one new candle). This process continues until there are not enough stubs left to create a new candle.\n3. **Iterative Process**: Calculate the total hours by summing the initial burn time and the additional burn time from the recycled candles. Keep track of the stubs generated from each cycle of recycling to ensure no stub is wasted.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nstubs = a\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new_candles = stubs // b\n    total += new_candles\n    stubs = (stubs % b) + new_candles\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `a` and `b`.\n2. **Initial Burn**: The initial number of candles `a` is burned, contributing `a` hours to the total.\n3. **Recycling Process**: While there are enough stubs to form a new candle (`stubs >= b`):\n   - Calculate the number of new candles that can be made from the current stubs.\n   - Add the burn time of these new candles to the total.\n   - Update the stub count to include both the leftover stubs from the current batch and the stubs from the newly burned candles.\n4. **Termination**: The loop terminates when there are not enough stubs to form another candle, and the total hours are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the maximum illumination time by iteratively recycling stubs and summing up the total hours from all sources.",
