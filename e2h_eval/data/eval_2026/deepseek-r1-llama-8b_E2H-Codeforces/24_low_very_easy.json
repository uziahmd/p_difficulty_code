She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Luba is trying to close some tabs in her browser. Hmm, let me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo, the setup is that she has n tabs open, from 1 to n. The cursor starts at position pos. She needs to keep the tabs from l to r and close all others. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right, but only within the current available tabs. Or she can close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum number of seconds needed to achieve this.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. It seems like a problem where we need to calculate the steps required to position the cursor in such a way that closing all unwanted tabs is efficient.\n\nFirst, I should figure out which tabs need to be closed. Those are the tabs outside [l, r]. So, for example, if l is 2 and r is 4, then tabs 1 and 5-6 (if n is 6) need to be closed.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no: in the first example, the input was '6 3 2 4'. So the tabs to close are 1 and 5,6. So after closing, only 2,3,4 remain.\n\nSo the process involves:\n\n1. Move the cursor to a position where you can close the necessary tabs efficiently.\n2. Close those tabs either on the left or right.\n3. Then, possibly move to another position if needed, but in this case, perhaps not.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down.\n\nThe initial state is all tabs open. We need to end up with only [l, r] open.\n\nSo, any tabs less than l must be closed, and any greater than r must be closed.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, when you close tabs, you can choose to close all to the left or right of the cursor. So, each time you close, you have the option to remove either left or right.\n\nBut the key is that each close operation can potentially remove a lot of tabs at once.\n\nSo the approach could be to figure out the optimal order of moving and closing to minimize the total steps.\n\nLet me consider the different possibilities.\n\nCase 1: The current position is inside [l, r], which it usually is since pos is between 1 and n.\n\nCase 2: Some tabs to the left of l need to be closed, and some to the right of r need to be closed.\n\nSo, the steps would involve:\n\na) Moving to a position where you can close the left tabs, then close them.\nb) Or maybe move to the right to close the right tabs first, then move back and close the left ones.\nc) Or decide which one is more efficient in terms of steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe you can close both sides from the same position, but that might not always be possible.\n\nSo, let's think about the initial position pos. Suppose pos is somewhere in [l, r]. So, we can potentially close the left and right tabs in any order.\n\nWait, but depending on where pos is, it may be better to close left or right first.\n\nFor example, suppose l=2, r=4, pos=3. So, to close the left (tab 1), you can just move left once, then close left. To close the right (tabs 5,6), you'd have to move to 4, then close right. Alternatively, you might need to move to 4, close right, then move back to 3, then close left.\n\nWait, but after closing the right, the a (minimum index) becomes 2 because all tabs beyond 4 are closed. So, when you close the right, a remains as 2, but b becomes 4.\n\nSo, after closing the right, the available tabs are 2,3,4. So, to close the left (tab 1), you can't do that anymore because it's already closed. Wait, no—wait, the initial step is that the tabs to close are outside [l, r]. So in the first example, the tabs to close are 1 and 5,6. So, when you close the right, you remove 5 and 6, leaving 2,3,4, which is exactly what we want.\n\nSo in that scenario, after closing the right, the left side is already within l=2, so no more action is needed on the left.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Move from pos 3 to 2: 1 step. Then close left: that closes tab 1. But wait, initially, the left is from 1 to 1. So, by closing left, that's done. But that leaves 2-6 except 5,6. No, wait, no: the initial state is 1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] while keeping the tabs within [l, r] open. Each second, Luba can either move the cursor left or right or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Tabs to Close**: Determine which tabs are outside the segment [l, r]. These are the tabs less than l and greater than r.\n2. **Calculate Steps for Closing Left Tabs**: If there are tabs to the left of l, calculate the steps required to move the cursor to position l and then close those tabs.\n3. **Calculate Steps for Closing Right Tabs**: Similarly, if there are tabs to the right of r, calculate the steps required to move the cursor to position r and then close those tabs.\n4. **Optimal Order**: Decide whether it is more efficient to close the left tabs first or the right tabs first based on the initial position of the cursor and the number of steps each option would take.\n5. **Sum the Steps**: Sum the steps for both closing actions to get the total minimum steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Calculate how many steps to close left and right\nleft_close = 0\nif l > 1:\n    # Need to close left: from 1 to l-1\n    # Move to l, then close left\n    left_steps = (l - pos) + 1  # moving to l, then one step to close\n    left_close = left_steps\n\nright_close = 0\nif r < n:\n    # Need to close right: from r+1 to n\n    # Move to r, then close right\n    right_steps = (pos - r) + 1  # moving to r, then one step to close\n    right_close = right_steps\n\n# Total steps is left_close + right_close, but check if some are zero\ntotal = left_close + right_close\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution involves calculating the steps needed to close tabs on both sides of the desired segment [l, r]. We consider the initial position of the cursor and determine the most efficient way to move and close the tabs. By summing the steps required for each side, we ensure that we find the minimum number of seconds needed to achieve the goal efficiently.",
