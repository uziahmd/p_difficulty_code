He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to convert a number from base a to base b, but with a twist. The third part of each door's lock has a number c in base a, and depending on whether the second part is R (meaning it's using the Roman numeral system) or another number, I have to write c in base b, but considering that if b is R, then it's using Roman numerals.\n\nHmm, wait, let me read the problem again carefully.\n\nThe input is two lines: the first line gives a and b, but b can be 'R' which indicates that the second part is using the Roman numeral system. Then the next line is the number c in base a, possibly with leading zeros. My task is to output c in base b, without leading zeros.\n\nSo, for example, if a is 10 and b is 2, then c is '1' in base 10. Converting 1 to base 2 would be '1', so output is '1'.\n\nAnother example: when a is 16 and b is 'R', then c is '5' in base 16. So converting 5 to Roman numerals is 'V', which is the output.\n\nWait, but what about when c is a larger number? Like in the third example, a is 5 and b is 'R'. c is '4' in base 5. So 4 in base 5 is 4 in decimal, which is IV in Roman numerals.\n\nOh right, and in other cases, like when a is 2 and b is 13, c is '1111001' in base 2. Let's see: 1111001 in binary is 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 = 64 +32+16+8 = 120. Then converting 120 into base 13: 13*9=117, remainder 3. So it's 9*13 + 3, which would be represented as A (since 13 is represented by A in base 13) followed by 3. But wait, wait, no: in base 13, digits go up to 12, so 13 is represented as 'A', right? Wait, no, wait: in bases higher than 10, letters are used for 10 onwards. So in base 13, 10 is 'A', 11 is 'B', etc., up to 12 being 'C'? Or maybe not—depends on how the problem defines it. Oh, wait, the note says that in bases greater than 10, we use A for 10, B for 11, etc. So in base 13, 10 is 'A', 11 'B', 12 'C', 13 is 'D', but wait, 13 is beyond the base. Wait no, the base is 13, so digits go up to 12. So 13 in base 13 is invalid. So 120 divided by 13 is 9 with remainder 3. So 9 * 13 is 117, plus 3 is 120. So in base 13, 9 is represented as IX? No, wait, wait: in Roman numerals, 9 is IX. But in base 13, 9 is just 'IX' as well? Or is it different?\n\nWait, no, I think I'm getting confused. The problem says that when the second part is 'R', the number is written in Roman numerals, regardless of the base. So for example, if b is 16, then the number is converted to a decimal, then expressed in Roman numerals.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The problem statement says that the door's parts are: a, either b or R, c, and empty. So when the second part is R, it's the Roman numeral system. So when you open the door, you take c (in base a), convert it to decimal, and then express that decimal number in the target base, which could be Roman numerals (if b is R) or another base.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the process is: when the second part is R, you treat the target base as Roman numerals. Otherwise, it's a regular base.\n\nSo, for example, if the input is a=10, b=R, and c is '16', then c is 16 in base 10. Then, since b is R, the target is to write 16 in Roman numerals, which is XVI.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input provided, the second line is '16 R\\n5', and the output is 'V'. Hmm, that suggests that when the second part is R, the conversion is from base a to decimal, and then represent that decimal number as a Roman numeral.\n\nWait, let me look at the sample:\n\nSample Input:\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nSo the first case is a=10, b=2, c='1' in base 10. So 1 in base 2 is '1', which is correct.\n\nSecond case: a=16, b=R, c='5' in base 16. So 5 in base 16 is 5 in decimal. Since b is R, output 5 as Roman numeral, which is 'V'.\n\nThird case: a=5, b=R, c='4' in base 5. 4 in base 5 is 4 in decimal. So output 'IV'.\n\nFourth case: a=2, b=2, c='1111001' in base 2. So same as base, output as is, '1111001'.\n\nFifth case: a=12, b=13, c='A' in base 12. So A is 10 in base 12, which is 10 in decimal. So in base 13, 10 is 'A', which is the output.\n\nSo yeah, when the second part is R, the target base is treated as Roman numerals, which is a special case.\n\nSo the overall approach is:\n\n1. Read a and b. If b is 'R', then the target is to represent the number in Roman numerals. Else, it's to represent it in base b.\n\n2. Read c, which is a string representing a number in base a.\n\n3. Convert c from base a to decimal.\n\n4. Then, if b is 'R', convert the decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\n5. Else, convert the decimal number to base b, making sure to omit leading zeros.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Parse a and b. Check if b is 'R' or a digit.\n\n- Convert c from base a to decimal.\n\n- Then, based on b, either convert to Roman or to base b.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement functions to:\n\na. Convert a string in base a to decimal.\n\nb. Convert a decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nc. Convert a decimal number to base b, ensuring that the output doesn't have leading zeros.\n\nLet's break it down.\n\nFirst, handling the base a to decimal conversion.\n\nFunction to convert a string s in base a to integer:\n\n- Iterate over each character in s.\n\n- For each character, get its value (digit). For example, '0' is 0, '1' is 1, ..., 'A' is 10, etc. Wait, wait—no, in base a, the digits can only go up to a-1. So for example, if a is 16, the digits allowed are 0-15, which are represented as 0-9, then A (10), B (11), up to F (15).\n\nSo, in the function, for each character in s:\n\n- If the character is a digit, its value is int(c).\n\n- Else, if it's uppercase, it's 10 + ord(c) - ord('A').\n\n- Else, lowercase letters are similar? Wait, the problem says that the input c may contain letters, but in the input, does it specify that letters are uppercase? The problem says \"non-negative integer c in base a\", and examples have 'A' in one case. So perhaps the function should handle both lower and upper case letters? Or perhaps in the input, c is given in uppercase.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that in bases higher than 10, we use A for 10, B for 11, etc. So the input c may have letters, but the code needs to process them correctly.\n\nSo for each character in c:\n\nif c is a digit, value is int(c).\n\nelse, it's a letter. But wait, in the problem statement, the input c is in base a, which could be up to 25. So for a=25, the digits can be 0-24. So letters would be from A (10) up to Y (24), but wait, 25 is represented as 'Z'? Wait no, because 25-1 is 24, so 24 is 'Y'? Or wait, I'm not sure. Let's think: in base a, the digits go from 0 to a-1. So for a=25, the maximum digit is 24. So the letters would be A=10, B=11, ..., Z=35? Wait, that can't be. Because 10 is 'A', 11 is 'B', ..., 35 is 'Z'. But a=25, so the maximum digit is 24. So 24 is 'Y'?\n\nWait, no. Wait, 0 is 0, 1 is 1, ..., 9 is 9. Then 10 is 'A', 11 is 'B', ..., 24 is 'Y' (since 10 is A, 11 B, ... 20 is T, 21 U, 22 V, 23 W, 24 X? Wait, no. Wait, 10 is A, 11 B, 12 C, 13 D, 14 E, 15 F, 16 G, 17 H, 18 I, 19 J, 20 K, 21 L, 22 M, 23 N, 24 O, 25 P? Wait, but in base 25, the digits go up to 24, so 24 is the last digit, which would be 'O' perhaps?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The function to convert a character to its value in base a needs to handle letters as per the standard way.\n\nSo for each character in c:\n\n- if it's between 0-9: value is int(c).\n\n- else, if it's uppercase or lowercase letter, it's considered as 10, 11, etc. But wait, the problem says that in the input, c is a non-negative integer in base a, so the letters are only present if a is higher than 10. But in any case, the function should process letters as their corresponding values.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should be case-insensitive for letters, but the input is likely to have uppercase letters. So in the function, for a character c:\n\nif c is a digit: value is int(c).\n\nelse:\n\nif c.upper() in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ': then its value is 10 + (ord(c.upper()) - ord('A')).\n\nElse, perhaps it's an error, but the problem states that the input is correct.\n\nSo for example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, ..., 'Z' is 35.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the fifth case is 'A' in base 12, which is 10 in decimal. So yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the function to parse a base a string into decimal is manageable.\n\nOnce the decimal value is obtained, we need to convert it to either Roman numerals or base b.\n\nConverting decimal to Roman numerals:\n\nRoman numerals are a bit tricky because of the subtractive notation (like IV for 4, IX for 9, XL for 40, etc.). So the standard approach is to create a mapping of Roman symbols to their values, ordered from highest to lowest. Then, iterate through the symbols, subtracting as much as possible.\n\nFor example, symbols = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I'),\n]\n\nThen, for each symbol, while the number is >= the value, append the corresponding letters and subtract the value.\n\nSo for 5, it's 'V'.\n\nFor 4, it's 'IV'.\n\nFor 38: 30 (XXX) + 5 (V) + 3 (III) → XXXVIII.\n\nWait, but in the sample, when the input is '5 R', which is 5 in base 5, which is 5 in decimal. So output is 'V'.\n\nYes, that aligns.\n\nNow, converting decimal to base b.\n\nBut wait, when b is 'R', we don't do this step. So for the general case, when b is a number, we have to convert the decimal number to base b, as a string, without leading zeros.\n\nHow to do that:\n\nWe repeatedly divide the number by b, collecting the remainders. But since the remainders can be more than 9, we have to represent them as letters (for bases above 10).\n\nWait, no: in the output, when the target base is a number, like 13, the digits are represented as 0-9, then A, B, etc., up to 12.\n\nSo, for example, 10 in base 13 is 'A', 11 is 'B', 12 is 'C', 13 is 'D' but that's beyond the base.\n\nWait, but the maximum digit in base b is b-1. So for base 13, digits can be 0-12. So 10 is 'A', 11 'B', 12 'C', 13 is beyond.\n\nSo the function to convert a decimal number to a string in base b must:\n\n- Handle digits 0-9, then A-Z for 10-35.\n\nBut wait, the input constraints say that the output won't exceed 101510 in decimal when not using Roman numerals. So for base 25, the maximum digit is 24, which is 'Y' perhaps.\n\nWait, but for bases up to 25, the letters needed are up to 24, which is 'Y' in 0-based or 'X' in 1-based? Hmm, no, I think for the function, the letters are in sequence starting from A=10, B=11, up to the maximum required digit.\n\nSo, for a digit d in the number:\n\nif d < 10: use str(d)\n\nelse: use chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n\nSo for d=10: 'A', 11: 'B', etc.\n\nSo the function to convert a decimal to a string in base b would:\n\n- if the number is zero: return '0' (but according to the problem statement, c is not zero, but the output can be zero only if c is zero. Wait, the problem says that c is non-zero.)\n\nWait, the problem says that c is a non-negative integer, but in any case, after conversion, the output cannot have leading zeros. So in the function, after converting, we can strip leading zeros.\n\nSo, steps for converting decimal n to base b:\n\nif n == 0: return '0'\n\nelse:\n\ndigits = []\n\nwhile n > 0:\n\n    remainder = n % b\n\n    if remainder < 10:\n\n        digits.append(str(remainder))\n\n    else:\n\n        digits.append(chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n\n    n = n // b\n\ndigits.reverse()\n\nresult = ''.join(digits)\n\nif result starts with '0's, remove them.\n\nWait, but in the sample, when a=2 and b=2, c is '1111001' which is 1+2+4+8+16+32+64=127 in decimal. So in base 2, it's the same as the input, but without leading zeros. So the output is '1111001'.\n\nSo, the function returns the digits as a string, without leading zeros.\n\nSo the function for base conversion is correct.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCheck if b is 'R'. If so, then after converting c to decimal, convert that decimal to Roman.\n\nElse, convert c to decimal, then to base b.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead a and b from the first line. Split the line into two parts. But wait, the first line is two integers, but sometimes 'R' is passed as the second part.\n\nWait, the first line is a string like '10 2\\n', so split into a and b_str. So:\n\nline1 = input().split()\na = int(line1[0])\nb_str = line1[1]\n\nThen, if b_str is 'R', then the target is Roman numerals. Else, it's a base.\n\nThen, read the second line:\n\nc_line = input().strip()\nc = c_line.split()[0]  # in case there are multiple parts, but according to the problem statement, it's a single number.\n\nSo, for example, in the fifth sample input, it's '12 13\\nA' → a=12, b_str=13, c='A'.\n\nSo, parsing c is straightforward.\n\nNow, the function to convert c from base a to decimal:\n\ndef str_to_decimal(s, base):\n\n    res = 0\n\n    for c in s:\n\n        val = 0\n\n        if c.isdigit():\n\n            val = int(c)\n\n        else:\n\n            # assume it's a letter\n\n            val = 10 + (ord(c.upper()) - ord('A'))\n\n        res = res * base + val\n\n    return res\n\nWait, but wait: in the problem statement, the second part is either b or R. So the function for c is in base a, which can be any base up to 25.\n\nYes, the function will handle that.\n\nTesting this function:\n\nFor '5' in base 5: 5 in decimal is 5.\n\nFor 'A' in base 12: 10.\n\nFor '1111001' in base 2: 1*(2^6) + 1*(2^5) + 1*(2^4) + 1*(2^3) = 64 +32+16+8= 120.\n\nYes.\n\nNext, function to convert decimal to Roman numerals:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I'),\n    ]\n\n    res = ''\n\n    for (i, r) in val:\n\n        while n >= i:\n\n            res += r\n\n            n -= i\n\n    return res\n\nTesting:\n\n5 → 'V'\n\n4 → 'IV'\n\n120 → 'CXX' (no, wait, 120 is 100 + 20 → CXX? Or wait, 100 is C, 20 is XX → CXX is 120. Yes.\n\nWait, no: 100 is C, 20 is XX → CXX is 120.\n\nSo for 120, the function would return 'CXX'.\n\nWait, no: 100 is subtracted once, 20 is XX, so total 120.\n\nSo the function returns 'CXX'.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the function for converting decimal to base b:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n\n    if n == 0:\n\n        return '0'\n\n    digits = []\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        rem = n % base\n\n        if rem < 10:\n\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n\n        else:\n\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n\n        n = n // base\n\n    digits.reverse()\n\n    return ''.join(digits)\n\nTesting:\n\nn=5, base=2 → '101'\n\nn=5, base=13 → '5' (since 5 is less than 13).\n\nn=10, base=13 → 'A'\n\nn=120, base=13 → 13*9=117, rem 3. So digits are 9 and 3. 9 in base 13 is '9', but wait no: 9 is represented as 'IX' in Roman, but in base 13, 9 is just '9'? Or wait, no: in base 13, digits are 0-12. So 9 is '9', and 3 is '3'. So 120 is 9*13 +3 → '93' in base 13.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, when a=12, b=13, c='A' (which is 10 in decimal), the output is 'A' → which makes sense, as 10 is less than 13.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the fifth case is a=12, b=13, c='A' → which is 10 in decimal. So output is 'A' because 10 is less than 13, so it's just 'A'.\n\nSo the function returns 'A' for n=10 and base=13.\n\nAnother test case: n=120, base=13.\n\nAs I said, 13*9=117, rem 3. So digits are [3,9], but reversed to [9,3]. Wait no: wait, when n is 120, 120//13 is 9, rem 3. So digits are [3,9], but when reversed, it's [9,3], so the string is '93' in base 13.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nRead a and b_str.\n\nc is the input string.\n\nParse a and b_str.\n\nCompute decimal_val = str_to_decimal(c, a).\n\nIf b_str is 'R':\n\n    roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_val)\n\nElse:\n\n    base = int(b_str)\n\n    base_str = decimal_to_base(decimal_val, base)\n\nOutput the result.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, when b is 'R', it's handled as Roman numerals.\n\nWait, in the sample input:\n\nInput line 2: '16 R\\n5' → a=16, b_str='R', c='5'.\n\nSo c is '5' in base 16 → 5 in decimal.\n\nSince b is 'R', output is 'V'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample: input line 3 is '5 R\\n4' → a=5, b_str='R', c='4' in base 5 → 4 in decimal → 'IV'.\n\nAnother case: input line 4 is '2 2\\n1111001' → a=2, b=2, c='1111001' → 127 in decimal. Since b is 2, output is '1111001'.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\nWhat about when c is '0' in base a? According to the problem statement, c is non-zero, so perhaps this case is not present.\n\nBut in the function, if c is '0', it will return 0, and then when converting to base b, it will output '0'.\n\nBut the problem says that c is non-zero.\n\nAnother edge case: when the decimal number is zero. But since c is non-zero, this can't happen.\n\nAnother case: when a is 1, but the problem says a is at least 2.\n\nWait, the problem statement says a and b are 2 ≤ a, b ≤25, except b can be R.\n\nSo no issues.\n\nAnother case: when the decimal number is 0. But according to the problem, c is non-zero, so the output can't be zero.\n\nWait, but in the function, when converting to base b, if the decimal number is zero, it returns '0', but according to the problem statement, this won't happen.\n\nNow, let's think about the function to convert c from base a to decimal.\n\nWait, what if a is 1? Well, the problem says a is ≥2, so no.\n\nWhat about letters in c? For example, c is 'A' in base 10 → 10 in decimal.\n\nYes, the function handles that.\n\nAnother thing: when a is 25 and c has 'Y' as a digit. So for a=25, c can have 'Y' as a digit, which represents 24.\n\nYes, the function converts 'Y' to 24.\n\nSo, now, putting all into code.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first case is ['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA'].\n\nWait, in code, the first line is split into '10' and '2' → a=10, b_str='2'.\n\nSecond line is '16 R\\n5' → c_line is '16 R', which is split into '16' and 'R' → but the function reads only the first part as c. Wait, no: the c is the entire string before the split. Wait, no, the code reads the c_line as the second line, and splits it into parts. But the c is the first part. So in '16 R', the first part is '16', but wait, no: the input is given as '16 R\\n5', so the second line is '16 R5'? No, looking back, in the sample input, it's shown as:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSo the second line is '16 R\\n5' → which is a line containing '16 R' followed by '5'? Or is it '16 R5'?\n\nWait, the way the input is structured is that each line is a string, where the first line is '10 2\\n1', which is a=10, b_str=2, c='1'.\n\nThe second line is '16 R\\n5' → which is a=16, b_str='R', c='5'.\n\nSo the code needs to read each line, split into a, b_str, and c.\n\nSo in code:\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\nline1 = lines[0].split()\n\na = int(line1[0])\n\nb_str = line1[1]\n\nline2 = lines[1].split()\n\nc = line2[0]\n\nSo, for the second line in the sample, line2 is '16 R5' → no, no. Wait, the sample input shows the second line as '16 R\\n5', which is a line with '16 R' followed by '5' on the same line. So when split(), it's ['16', 'R', '5'], but the c is the first part? Or wait, no: the problem says that the second line is a single non-negative integer c in base a. So the entire c is given as a string, possibly containing letters and digits, but no spaces.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\nAh, so the second line is a single non-negative integer c in base a. So the entire line is the c string, possibly containing letters and digits, but no spaces. So the code should read the entire line as c.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. So the second line is a single string representing c in base a. So in the sample, the second line is '16 R5'? No, the sample shows:\n\nIn the sample input, the second line is '16 R\\n5', which may be a formatting issue. Wait, the actual input is:\n\nAfter reading, the second line is '16 R5' → but that can't be, because the problem says it's a single non-negative integer c in base a. So perhaps the sample is a misrepresentation.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is presented as a list of lines, each being a separate input line. So the first line is '10 2\\n1', which is a=10, b=2, c=1.\n\nThe second line is '16 R\\n5' → which is a=16, b='R', c='5'.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the second line is a single non-negative integer c in base a, so the c is the entire string, possibly including letters and numbers, but no spaces.\n\nSo, the code should read the second line, strip any leading/trailing whitespace, and take the entire string as c.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the second line is '16 R\\n5', which would imply that c is '16 R5' → which is incorrect because it contains a space. So perhaps the sample is not accurate, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, looking back at the sample input:\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is written as:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nWhich is probably a representation of the input lines. So, the first line is a=10, b=2, c='1'; the second line is a=16, b='R', c='5'; the third line is a=5, b='R', c='4'; the fourth line is a=2, b=2, c='1111001'; the fifth line is a=12, b=13, c='A'.\n\nSo the second line is '16 R\\n5' → which is a=16, b='R', c='5'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the second line is a single non-negative integer c in base a. So the c is '5' in the second line.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. So perhaps the problem statement is using newlines as separators for the input lines, and within each line, the c is the entire string.\n\nSo, for the second line, '16 R\\n5' → that can't be, because it's a single line, but the c is '5'? Or perhaps the line is '16 R5' → but that would be a=16, b='R5' which is invalid.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is written as a list of lines, each line being a separate input. So the first line is '10 2\\n1', meaning a=10, b=2, c=1.\n\nThe second line is '16 R\\n5' → which is a=16, b='R', c=5.\n\nBut wait, that would make c=5, which is correct. So, the code should read each line as a separate line, and in the second line, the entire string is '16 R\\n5' → but that's not correct because it's a single line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second line is '16 R5' → which is a=16, b='R5', which is invalid.\n\nNo, perhaps the sample is misrepresented, and the actual input is that each line is the three components, but in the problem statement, the way the sample is presented is a list of five input lines.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is a list of input lines, each representing a test case. So the first line is the first test case, the second line is the second test case, etc.\n\nEach test case consists of two lines: the first line is a and b, the second line is c.\n\nSo, for example, the first test case is:\n\nLine 1: '10 2' → a=10, b=2.\n\nLine 2: '1' → c='1'.\n\nSecond test case:\n\nLine 1: '16 R' → a=16, b='R'.\n\nLine 2: '5' → c='5'.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, in code, the input is read as a list of lines, and for each test case, we process two consecutive lines.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the program must read from stdin and print to stdout. So, the code must read all input at once, then process each test case.\n\nSo, the code should read all lines, then for each test case, process two lines: a and b, then c.\n\nSo, the code can read all lines, then loop through pairs.\n\nBut in the sample, it's presented as a list of five test cases, each with two lines.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.rstrip('\\n') for line in sys.stdin]\n\ntest_cases = []\ni = 0\nwhile i < len(lines):\n    # Read a and b\n    ab_line = lines[i]\n    a_b = ab_line.split()\n    a = int(a_b[0])\n    b_str = a_b[1]\n    # Read c\n    c_line = lines[i+1]\n    c = c_line.strip()\n    test_cases.append( (a, b_str, c) )\n    i += 2\n\nThen, for each test case, process.\n\nYes, this makes sense.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nRead all lines.\n\nProcess each test case in pairs.\n\nNow, the functions:\n\nImplement the str_to_decimal, decimal_to_roman, and decimal_to_base functions.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling uppercase and lowercase letters in c.\n\n- Leading zeros in the output.\n\n- When converting to base b, ensure that leading zeros are omitted.\n\nWait, in the function decimal_to_base, when n is zero, it returns '0', but according to the problem statement, c is non-zero, so n can't be zero. So no problem.\n\nAnother thing: when converting to base b, the function returns the digits in order, without leading zeros.\n\nTesting the function:\n\nn=5, b=2 → '101'\n\nn=5, b=13 → '5'\n\nn=10, b=13 → 'A'\n\nn=120, b=13 → '93'\n\nn=0 → '0' → but c is non-zero, so no.\n\nNow, implementing the code.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nSo, the code will:\n\n1. Read all lines.\n\n2. For each test case, extract a, b_str, c.\n\n3. Convert c from base a to decimal.\n\n4. If b_str is 'R', convert decimal to Roman.\n\n5. Else, convert decimal to base b_str, as a string without leading zeros.\n\n6. Output the result.\n\nSo, writing the code.\n\nPotential corner cases:\n\n- c is '0' → but according to problem statement, it's non-zero.\n\n- a is 2, c is '0001' → which is 1 → output '1'.\n\n- a is 16, c is 'FF' → 15*16 +15= 255.\n\nTesting the functions:\n\nstr_to_decimal('FF', 16) → 255.\n\ndecimal_to_roman(255) → 'CCCLXI'?\n\nWait, 200 is CC, 50 is L, 5 is V → 200+50+5=255 → CC L V → 'CCLV'.\n\nWait, 255 = 200 + 50 + 5 → 200 is 'CC', 50 is 'L', 5 is 'V' → so 'CC LV' → 'CCLV'.\n\nSo, the function returns 'CCLV'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'MCMXCIV' is 1994.\n\nTesting the function:\n\ndecimal_to_roman(1994) → 'MCMXCIV'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'III' is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'XLII' is 42.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'D' is 500.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'MMMCMXCIX' is 3999.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the function is correct.\n\nNow, for the function decimal_to_base, when base is 2:\n\nn=3 → '11'.\n\nn=4 → '100'.\n\nn=5 → '101'.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother case: n=26, base=16 → '1A'.\n\nYes.\n\nn=26, base=25 → '11'.\n\nBecause 25 +1 =26.\n\nSo the function returns '11' in base 25.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=24, base=25 → 'Y' (since 24 is Y in base 25).\n\nWait, no: 24 is represented as 'Y' in base 25.\n\nBecause:\n\nFor n=24, base=25:\n\nrem = 24 → 24 >= 10 → 'Y'.\n\nn becomes 0.\n\nSo the function returns 'Y'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=35, base=25 → 35 /25 = 1, rem 10 → 'A'.\n\nSo the function returns '1A'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the function works.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nImplementing in Python.\n\nAlso, note that the problem expects the code to read from stdin and write to stdout, without any additional explanations.\n\nSo, the code will be as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from base `a` to either base `b` or Roman numerals, depending on the input.
