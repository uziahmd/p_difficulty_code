            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to convert a number from one base (a) to another (b), but with the catch that if the second base is 'R', it's not a regular base but the Roman numeral system. Hmm, right.\n\nLet me try to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the input gives me two integers a and b on the first line. But wait, b can be 'R' which represents the Roman numeral system. So I need to handle cases where b is R separately.\n\nThe next line is a non-negative integer c in base a. Its length can be up to 103 digits, which is pretty long. Also, leading zeros are allowed here. The output should be the same number converted to base b, but without leading zeros.\n\nSo the main steps are:\n\n1. Read a, b.\n2. Read the number c in base a.\n3. Convert c from base a to an integer (decimal).\n4. Then, depending on what b is:\n   - If b is R: convert the decimal number to Roman numerals.\n   - Else: convert the decimal to base b as a string.\n\nWait, but when converting to Roman numerals, there's the specific way those symbols are used. So I need a helper function for that.\n\nAlso, for the base conversion when b is not R, I'll have to make sure that the output doesn't have leading zeros unless the number is zero. Oh, but the problem says it's guaranteed that the number isn't zero, except when using Roman numerals. Wait, no—looking back, the problem says that if the number uses Roman numerals (i.e., if b is R), then the number is non-zero. Otherwise, the number is <=101510, but could be zero? Or wait, the input says that if using Roman numerals, the number won't be zero. So for other bases, the number could be zero, but according to the problem statement, the input ensures that the number isn't zero in any case except when using Roman numerals, but I'm not sure. Well, maybe it's better to handle leading zeros in the output correctly regardless.\n\nBut for the output, when converting to base b (not R), we need to omit leading zeros. So for example, if the converted number is 0, but according to the problem, that's not possible except when using R, but since in R, the number isn't zero, perhaps in other bases, the number can be zero. Wait, looking at the problem statement again: It says, \"it is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0.\" So for other cases, the number can be zero? Because the problem says that it's guaranteed for the Roman case, but for others, it's not specified. So perhaps our code needs to handle c=0 correctly when converting to other bases.\n\nSo, first, the plan is:\n\n- Parse the input a and b. If b is 'R', then we need to convert to Roman numerals. Else, we convert to base b.\n\nBut wait, the input may have the second part of the first line as 'R'. For example, in the sample input, one of the test cases is '16 R\\n5', which probably means a=10, b=R, and c=16 (base 10). So the code will process this by converting 16 (base 10) into Roman numerals, which is XVI.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to do is read a and b correctly. Since b can be 'R', but a is always an integer.\n\nSo, the initial steps:\n\nRead the first line: split into two parts, a_str and b_str. a is int(a_str). For b, if it's 'R', then we use Roman numerals. Else, we treat it as an integer.\n\nThen, read the second line: c_str, which is a string in base a.\n\nNow, the challenge is to convert c_str from base a to a decimal number, then convert that number to base b or Roman numerals.\n\nSo, first, let's think about how to convert c_str from base a to decimal.\n\nBut wait, the c_str can be very long (up to 103 digits). So for Python, handling big integers is manageable, but we have to process the string correctly.\n\nFor base conversion from a to decimal:\n\nEach digit in c_str is a character, representing a value in base a. So for each character, we find its value (like, 'A' is 10, etc.), multiply by a^(position) and sum all.\n\nBut wait, since a can be up to 25, each digit can be 0 to a-1. But wait, in the input, c_str is given in base a, which can include digits beyond 10,",
