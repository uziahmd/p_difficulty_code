The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and I need to figure out the best approach. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about selecting which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of their fans is maximized. Each district's fan count is 2^i, where i is the district number. The president wants to remove k contestants, but after removal, all remaining must be reachable from each other. So, the goal is to find which k districts to remove to maximize the sum.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure. The districts form a tree since there's exactly one path between any two districts. So, the problem reduces to finding a subtree (a connected subgraph) of size n - k that includes as many high-value nodes as possible.\n\nEach node has a value of 2^d, where d is the district number. So higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more to the total. Therefore, to maximize the sum, we should keep as many high-numbered districts as possible and remove as many lower-numbered ones as needed.\n\nWait, but how does the tree structure affect this? Because the decision to remove a node affects its children and ancestors. So perhaps the optimal approach is to remove the nodes in such a way that the highest possible nodes are kept, and the lowest possible nodes are removed.\n\nHmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of the centroid or some hierarchical structure. Or perhaps, we can model this as selecting a subtree where the sum is maximum by choosing the largest possible nodes and their necessary connections.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first sample:\n\nn=6, k=3. The districts form a tree. The output suggests removing 1, 3,4. So the remaining are 2,5,6.\n\nDistrict 2: 2^2=4\n5: 32\n6:64\nTotal 100.\n\nBut why not remove some others? Like 1,2,3,4? No, because that would leave 5,6, which is only two districts. But they are connected through 2, but wait, if 2 is removed, then 5 and 6 can't reach each other. So that wouldn't work.\n\nWait, no. After removal, the remaining districts must form a connected component. So the subtree must be connected.\n\nSo, the key is to find a connected subtree with as many high-value nodes as possible, and the size is n - k.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe we can model the tree as a hierarchy, and for each node, decide whether to include it or not, based on the number of nodes that can be included in its subtree.\n\nWait, another approach: the sum of 2^i for the selected nodes is maximized when we select the largest possible nodes. So the optimal strategy is to keep all the highest m nodes, ensuring that they form a connected subtree, and then remove the others.\n\nWait, but it's possible that keeping certain lower nodes allows us to keep more high nodes. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since each node's value is 2^i, which grows exponentially, the optimal solution will involve keeping as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to find the minimal number of low nodes that need to be removed to allow the higher nodes to remain connected.\n\nAnother thought: the tree's structure determines which nodes are essential for connecting higher nodes. For example, if a node is a leaf, removing it doesn't affect the rest. But if it's a bridge between two parts of the tree, removing it disconnects those parts.\n\nWait, but in a tree, every edge is a bridge. So, if you have a chain like 1-2-3-4-5, and you want to keep 5,4,3, but remove 1 and 2, you need to make sure that 3 is connected to 4, which it is. But if you have a more complex structure, you might need to remove certain nodes to keep the higher ones connected.\n\nSo, perhaps the idea is to find a subtree that includes the highest possible nodes, and includes as few low nodes as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find a subtree that contains the top (n -k) nodes, but connected. So, the question reduces to selecting the minimal number of low nodes to remove so that the top (n -k) nodes form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how do we determine which nodes are part of the top (n -k) nodes?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal selection is to find a root such that the subtree under it (including the root) has exactly (n -k) nodes, and the sum of their 2^i is maximized. So, the root should be as high as possible.\n\nWait, but how to compute this.\n\nLet me think differently. Since each node's value is 2^i, the sum is maximized when we include as many high-numbered nodes as possible. So, the optimal subtree will consist of a set of nodes where the highest possible nodes are all included, except for some that may be necessary to exclude to maintain connectivity.\n\nSo perhaps, the way to approach this is to find the subtree of size (n -k) that includes the largest possible nodes.\n\nBut how to find such a subtree?\n\nAn alternative approach: the maximum sum is achieved by including all nodes except for the k smallest possible in terms of their contribution to the connectivity of the higher nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to find the minimal set of nodes that need to be kept to connect the higher nodes. Then, among those, we include as many high nodes as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find a subtree where the sum is the sum of the largest possible nodes, and the subtree is connected.\n\nTo model this, perhaps the process is:\n\n1. Sort all nodes by their value in descending order.\n2. Select the top m = n -k nodes.\n3. Check if these nodes form a connected subtree.\n4. If yes, return them.\n5. If not, find the minimal number of additional nodes to include from the next in line to make the subset connected.\n\nBut how to efficiently find such a subset.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the problem as finding a subtree where the sum is maximum, and the subtree has exactly (n -k) nodes.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding a connected subgraph with maximum sum, given a certain size.\n\nSo, what is the maximum sum when choosing a connected subgraph with exactly s nodes from a tree, where each node has a weight w_i=2^i.\n\nIn our case, s = n -k.\n\nThe approach here would be to find such a subtree.\n\nBut how?\n\nI recall that in trees, the maximum sum connected subgraph of a certain size can be found using dynamic programming, but for large n up to 1e6, that's not feasible.\n\nWait, but given that each node's value is 2^i, which is exponentially increasing, the optimal subtree will consist of the top (n -k) nodes, possibly adjusted for connectivity.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the subtree that includes all nodes except for the k smallest in terms of their impact on the overall sum. So, perhaps the strategy is to keep all the nodes except the ones that are the least important for connecting the higher nodes.\n\nBut how to determine which nodes are the least important.\n\nAlternatively, considering that higher-numbered nodes are exponentially more valuable, perhaps the optimal subtree includes as many as possible of the higher-numbered nodes, and the minimal number of lower nodes needed to connect them.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n- Find the largest possible set of nodes where the sum is maximized, and the set is connected, with size (n -k).\n\nBut how to find this set.\n\nAnother angle: the maximum sum connected subgraph of size s is achieved by including the s largest nodes, provided they can be connected. If they can't be connected, then we need to include some lower nodes to form a connected subgraph.\n\nWait, but for example, in a straight line tree (like a linked list), the top s nodes will be the last s nodes. But if s is less than the entire length, they won't be connected unless we include some lower nodes.\n\nSo, in that case, the optimal is to include the last s nodes, and the one before them, etc., until the entire subset is connected.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to find the minimal number of lower nodes required to connect the top s nodes.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as follows:\n\nWe need to select a subtree that includes as many of the top (n -k) nodes as possible, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree.\n\nIf the top (n -k) nodes already form a connected subtree, then that's the answer.\n\nOtherwise, we need to find the minimal number of lower nodes to add to this set to make it connected.\n\nWait, but the problem is to remove k nodes, which implies that the remaining is (n -k) nodes.\n\nSo, the approach is to find a connected subtree of size (n -k) with maximum sum.\n\nGiven that the nodes' values are 2^i, the sum is maximized when the subtree includes the highest possible nodes.\n\nSo, the optimal subtree will be the one that includes the top (n -k) nodes, but if they're not connected, we'll have to include some lower nodes to make it connected.\n\nBut how to find which lower nodes to include.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to find the largest subtree that can be formed by removing exactly k nodes, ensuring that the remaining is connected.\n\nWait, but that's the same as the problem statement.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to find the minimal subtree that connects the top (n -k) nodes, and see if that requires removing more or fewer than k nodes.\n\nWait, maybe another way: the maximum sum is achieved by including all the top (n -k) nodes, but the subtree must include all of them. So, the subtree is the minimal subtree that connects all these top nodes.\n\nBut how to compute the number of nodes in this minimal subtree.\n\nWait, for example, in the first sample, the top (6-3)=3 nodes are 6,5,2. Wait, no. Wait, n=6, k=3, so m=3. The top 3 nodes in terms of value would be 6 (2^6=64), 5 (32), and 2 (4). These three are already connected via edges (district 2 is connected to 6 and 5 is connected to 6). So the subtree includes 2,5,6, and maybe 6 is connected to 2, which is connected to 3, but 3 is not in the top 3.\n\nWait, no, in the first sample, the output is to remove 1,3,4. So the remaining are 2,5,6, which are connected via 2-6 and 5-6. So they form a connected subtree.\n\nSo, the minimal subtree needed to connect 6,5,2 is just those three, plus any necessary lower nodes?\n\nWait, 6 is connected to 2, and 2 is connected to 5? Or wait, in the input, the roads are:\n\n2 1\n\n2 6\n\n4 2\n\n5 6\n\n2 3\n\nSo the tree looks like this:\n\n1 is connected to 2.\n\n2 is connected to 6, 4, 3.\n\n6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo, the subtree that includes 6,5,2 is connected as follows: 6 is connected to 2 via 2-6. 2 is connected to 5 via 2-6-5? No, 5 is directly connected to 6. So 5 is connected to 6, which is connected to 2, which is connected to 4, etc.\n\nWait, but the subtree for 2,5,6 is connected via 6-2 and 6-5. So 5 and 2 are connected through 6.\n\nSo in this case, the top 3 nodes form a connected subtree.\n\nSo the sum is 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^2 = 32+64+4=100.\n\nWhich is the maximum possible.\n\nSo, in this case, the optimal is to include the top 3 nodes, which are connected, so no need to include any lower nodes beyond what is required for their connectivity.\n\nBut what if the top s nodes are not connected? For example, imagine a tree where the top s nodes form a disconnected set. Then, to make them connected, we need to include some lower nodes.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Collect the top s = n -k nodes.\n\n2. Check if they form a connected subtree.\n\n3. If yes, that's the answer.\n\n4. If not, find the minimal number of lower nodes to include to make them connected. Then, the total number of nodes becomes s + (number of added nodes) = s', which must be <= s. Wait, no, because adding a node increases the size.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial top s nodes are s in number. Adding a node increases the total to s+1, which is larger than n-k. So that's not acceptable.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. We need to choose exactly (n -k) nodes, which form a connected subtree. So, the top s nodes may not be connected, but we can include some lower nodes to form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how to find the minimal number of lower nodes to include.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by finding the minimal number of nodes to remove (which is k) such that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree with maximum sum.\n\nSince the sum is maximized by including as many high nodes as possible, the optimal is to include the top s nodes, but if they are not connected, we have to include some lower nodes to connect them.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- Identify the top s nodes. Let's call this set S.\n\n- Compute the minimal number of nodes to add to S to make it connected. Let's say this is t nodes.\n\n- If s + t <= n, then the total nodes after adding is s + t, which is greater than s. But we need exactly s = n -k nodes.\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number of nodes to include is (t) which, when added to S, makes the entire set connected. But since we can't have more than s nodes, we need to find a connected subtree that includes as much of S as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to find a connected subtree of size s that includes as many of the top s nodes as possible.\n\nWait, but how.\n\nAnother idea: the maximum sum is achieved by including the s highest nodes, and ensuring that the subtree is connected. To do that, if the s highest nodes are already connected, that's the solution. Otherwise, we need to include some lower nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how to find which lower nodes to include.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the minimal subtree that connects all the s highest nodes. The number of nodes in this subtree is the number of nodes in the minimal Steiner tree for these s nodes. Then, the size of this Steiner tree must be <= s + ... ?\n\nNo, perhaps not. Because the Steiner tree might require adding some nodes.\n\nWait, but for the problem, the size of the subtree must be exactly s = n -k. So, the sum of the subtree's nodes must be exactly s.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nAlternative approach: For each node, calculate the number of nodes in its subtree. Then, find the node whose subtree has exactly s = n -k nodes, and choose all nodes in that subtree. This way, the subtree is connected, and the sum is maximized.\n\nBecause higher nodes have higher value, so including as many higher nodes as possible is better.\n\nWait, but why would the subtree rooted at a particular node give the maximum sum.\n\nFor example, if I take a node x, and include its entire subtree, the sum is the sum of 2^i for all nodes in the subtree. The larger the subtree, the more higher nodes it includes.\n\nBut perhaps the subtree rooted at a node x has exactly s nodes. That way, the sum is the sum of the s highest nodes, assuming that x is as high as possible.\n\nWait, but in a tree, the subtree of a node x consists of x and all its descendants.\n\nSo, if I choose x such that the size of its subtree is s, then the subtree includes x and all its descendants. The sum is the sum of 2^x + 2^y + ... for all y in the subtree.\n\nBut the sum of the subtree is 2^x multiplied by (2^{size} - 1), because each node contributes 2^y, and the subtree includes x, whose y is x.\n\nWait, no, because the subtree includes x and its descendants, which may have varying y's.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The subtree could include nodes in various positions, so their 2^y values vary.\n\nBut the idea is that the sum is maximized when the subtree is as high as possible.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFind a node x such that the size of its subtree is exactly s = n -k. Then, include all nodes in x's subtree. The sum will be the sum of all 2^i for i in the subtree.\n\nBut why would this be the optimal?\n\nBecause the higher the node x, the higher the sum of the subtree. So, for example, if x is the root of the tree, and its subtree is the whole tree, then the sum is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2^(n+1) - 2. But if x is a higher node, then perhaps the subtree is smaller but includes higher numbers.\n\nWait, no, because the root is node 1, which is the lowest-numbered node. Its subtree includes all nodes, which is the entire tree. But if x is a higher node, say node 6, and the subtree size is s, then the subtree would consist of node 6 and its children, which are lower in the tree, but their numbers are higher.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the numbering of the districts is arbitrary. The tree is given, and the nodes are numbered from 1 to n. So, node 6 could be a child of node 2, which is the parent of 1.\n\nWait, no, in the first sample, the tree is:\n\n1 is connected to 2.\n\n2 is connected to 6, 3, 4, and 1.\n\n6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo, the subtree of node 6 is just {6,5}, size 2.\n\nSubtree of node 2 is {1,2,3,4,6,5}, size 6.\n\nSo, if k=3, s=3. So, we need a subtree of size 3.\n\nSo, the best is to choose a subtree of size 3. Which node x's subtree is of size 3.\n\nLooking at the tree:\n\n- Node 5's subtree is size 1.\n\n- Node 6's subtree is size 2.\n\n- Node 3's subtree is size 1.\n\n- Node 4's subtree is size 1.\n\n- Node 2's subtree is size 5 (since it has 1,3,4,6,5 as children? Or wait, no, node 2's children are 1, 3,4,6,5? Or maybe 1 is the parent, so node 2's subtree is all nodes except 1.\n\nWait, the tree is built as per the input. Let's re-express the first sample's tree.\n\nThe input lines are:\n\n2 1\n\n2 6\n\n4 2\n\n5 6\n\n2 3\n\nSo, edges are:\n\n1-2\n\n2-6\n\n2-4\n\n2-3\n\n6-5\n\nSo, the tree structure is:\n\n1 is connected to 2.\n\n2 is connected to 6,4,3.\n\n6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo, the subtree sizes for each node:\n\nnode 1: subtree includes everything. Size 6.\n\nnode 2: subtree includes nodes 1,3,4,6,5,2. Size 6.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when considering the subtree rooted at node 2, it includes all nodes except node 1. Because node 1 is the parent of 2.\n\nWait, perhaps the subtree size for a node is the number of nodes in its subtree, including itself, when considering it as the root of a tree.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the key is to find, for each node, the size of its subtree if the tree is considered as a rooted tree with node 1 as the root. Then, for each node x, if the size of x's subtree is s = n -k, then including all nodes in x's subtree gives a connected component of size s, and the sum is the sum of 2^i for all i in the subtree.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- Compute the size of the subtree for each node.\n\n- For each node x, if the subtree size is s, then collect all nodes in x's subtree, sort them, and output the ones that are removed (those not in the subtree).\n\nWait, but wait. Because the president wants to remove k nodes. So, the nodes not in the subtree are the ones being removed. So, the output is the list of nodes not in x's subtree.\n\nBut how to find x such that the subtree size is exactly s = n -k.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, n=6, k=3, s=3. Is there a node x whose subtree size is 3?\n\nLooking at the tree:\n\n- node 5: subtree size is 1.\n\n- node 6: subtree size is 2 (nodes 6 and 5).\n\n- node 3: subtree size is 1.\n\n- node 4: subtree size is 1.\n\n- node 2: subtree size is 5 (nodes 2,1,3,4,6,5? Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, no. When the tree is rooted at 1, the subtree of node 2 includes all its descendants: 6,5,4,3.\n\nWait, no. Because node 2's parent is 1, so its children are 6,4,3.\n\nNode 6 has child 5.\n\nSo, the subtree of node 2 includes nodes 2,6,5,4,3,1.\n\nWait, no. Because when considering node 2 as a subtree, it includes itself and all its descendants. But node 2's parent is 1, so in the original tree, node 2 is a child of 1. So, the subtree of node 2 is all nodes that are in its branch, including node 1.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Because node 1 is the root. So, the subtree of node 2 includes all nodes in the tree except those in node 1's other subtrees.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused about the direction of edges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way to compute the subtree size is to perform a post-order traversal, counting the number of nodes in each subtree.\n\nBut in this case, the tree is undirected, so each node (except the root) has exactly one parent.\n\nSo, for each node x, the size of its subtree is the number of nodes in its own branch, including itself.\n\nSo, in the first sample:\n\nnode 1 has children [2].\n\nnode 2 has children [6,3,4].\n\nnode 6 has child [5].\n\nSo, the subtree sizes:\n\nnode 5: 1.\n\nnode 6: 2 (itself and 5).\n\nnode 3: 1.\n\nnode 4: 1.\n\nnode 2: 1 + 3 (from 3,4,6) + 2 (from 6's subtree) = 1+3+2=6.\n\nnode 1: 1 + 1 (from 2's subtree) = 6.\n\nWait, that can't be right because node 1's subtree is the entire tree.\n\nSo, for each node x, the size of its subtree is the number of nodes in the tree that are in the same branch as x, starting from x.\n\nSo, for node 2, the subtree includes itself, 6,5,3,4,1.\n\nNo, that's not correct. Because node 1 is the root, and node 2 is a child of 1. So the subtree of node 2 is all nodes that can be reached from 2 without going back to 1. So, node 2's subtree includes 2,6,5,3,4.\n\nWait, but node 1 is the parent of 2, so node 2's subtree doesn't include 1.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, in this case, the subtree of node 2 is 5 nodes: 2,6,5,3,4. So, the size is 5.\n\nSo, for the first sample, s=3. We need a subtree of size 3.\n\nLooking for nodes whose subtree size is 3.\n\nLooking at each node:\n\n- node 5: size 1.\n\n- node 6: size 2.\n\n- node 3: size 1.\n\n- node 4: size 1.\n\n- node 2: size 5.\n\n- node 1: size 6.\n\nNone of the nodes have a subtree size of 3.\n\nHmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, but according to the sample, the optimal is to remove 1,3,4. So the remaining nodes are 2,5,6.\n\nThese nodes form a connected subtree.\n\nWhat's the size of this subtree?\n\nIt's 3 nodes.\n\nBut which node's subtree is this?\n\nWell, node 2's subtree includes 2,6,5,3,4. So, if I consider node 2's subtree, it's size 5. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is not rooted at a single node, but is a connected component that may include multiple branches.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach of selecting the subtree rooted at a node is insufficient.\n\nHmm, this complicates things.\n\nSo, the previous approach may not work.\n\nAlternative idea: The maximum sum is achieved by including all the top s nodes, regardless of their connectivity, but ensuring that the subset forms a connected subtree.\n\nBut how to find which nodes to include.\n\nAnother approach: Since the sum is maximized when higher-numbered nodes are included, the optimal solution will include all the highest s nodes and any necessary lower nodes to connect them.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n1. Sort all nodes in decreasing order of their value (i.e., in order of their district number, since 2^i increases with i).\n\n2. Select the top s nodes.\n\n3. Check if they form a connected subtree.\n\n   a. If yes, output them.\n\n   b. If not, find the minimal number of lower nodes to include to make them connected.\n\nBut then, the problem is, how to find the minimal number of lower nodes to include.\n\nBut for the problem, we need to remove exactly k nodes, so the number of nodes in the subtree is exactly s = n -k.\n\nSo, perhaps the process is:\n\n- Take the top s nodes.\n\n- Check if they form a connected subtree. If yes, done.\n\n- If not, find the minimal number of nodes to add (from the non-top nodes) to make them connected.\n\nBut the sum would then be the sum of the top s nodes plus the added nodes, which may decrease the sum compared to including some higher nodes.\n\nBut wait, the added nodes are lower, so their inclusion may reduce the overall sum.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach isn't optimal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal solution is to find a connected subtree of size s, which includes as many of the top s nodes as possible.\n\nBut again, how to model this.\n\nPerhaps, the solution is to find a connected subtree of size s, and within that subtree, include as many of the top s nodes as possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the optimal subtree is the one that contains all the top s nodes, and any additional nodes needed to connect them.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Collect the top s nodes.\n\n2. Find the minimal number of additional nodes required to connect them, such that the total nodes in the subtree is s + t, where t is the number of added nodes.\n\nBut wait, this may exceed s.\n\nNo, because the original top s nodes are s. Adding t nodes brings the total to s + t. But for the problem, the size must be s, so adding nodes is not allowed.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe problem is equivalent to finding a connected subtree of size s, and the sum of 2^i for the nodes in the subtree is maximized.\n\nSo, the approach is to find the connected subtree of size s with maximum sum.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nGiven that each node has a weight 2^i, which is exponentially increasing, the sum is maximized when the subtree includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nThus, the optimal subtree will include the s highest-numbered nodes, provided they can form a connected subtree. If they cannot, then we need to include some lower nodes to connect them, thus trading off a small sum for the ability to include all s high nodes.\n\nBut how to find whether the top s nodes form a connected subtree.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to proceed is to find the minimal number of nodes to include from below s to connect the top s.\n\nBut how.\n\nWait, perhaps the top s nodes are all in a path. For example, in a chain, the top s nodes are consecutive, so they are connected.\n\nBut in a general tree, the top s nodes may be scattered.\n\nSo, to connect them, the minimal number of nodes to add is equal to the number of \"gaps\" in their current connections.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes all the top s nodes and the minimal number of lower nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how to find which lower nodes to include.\n\nAn alternative approach is to find the minimal subtree that connects all the top s nodes. The size of this subtree is the number of nodes in it. Let's denote this as m. Then, if m <= s, we can choose the top s nodes plus (m - s) nodes from the lower part. Wait, no, because m could be larger than s.\n\nWait, no, because m is the number of nodes in the minimal subtree connecting the top s nodes. If m is larger than s, then the minimal subtree is larger than s, but we need a subtree of size exactly s.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nPerhaps the solution is to model the problem as follows:\n\n- Find the minimal number of nodes to remove so that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree of size s.\n\n- Among all such possible sets, select the one with the maximum sum.\n\nBut with n up to 1e6, we need an O(n) or O(n log n) algorithm.\n\nAn alternative Idea:\n\nSince the sum is 2^i, the optimal connected subtree is the one that includes all the nodes with i >= some threshold, such that the size of this subset is s.\n\nBut how to find this threshold.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the set of nodes with i >= x, for some x, and the size of this set is s. The x is chosen as the smallest possible, such that the size of the set {x, x+1, ..., n} is s.\n\nBut wait, that's not necessarily the case because the tree may not allow all these nodes to be connected.\n\nFor example, if the nodes are arranged in a chain, and s is 3, then including the last three nodes would form a connected subtree.\n\nBut if the tree is a star with the root at node 1, and s=3, then the three highest nodes (n-2, n-1, n) are all connected to 1, so including them requires including 1 as well, making the size 4, which is larger than s=3.\n\nSo, the sum would be 2^1 + 2^{n-2} + ... which is worse than including node 1 and excluding some higher nodes.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, the problem is not as straightforward as including all nodes above a certain threshold.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe maximum sum is achieved by including as many high nodes as possible, even if that means including some lower nodes to keep them connected.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to find the minimal number of nodes to include from below s to make the top s nodes connected.\n\nBut how.\n\nPerhaps, the process is:\n\n1. Collect the top s nodes.\n\n2. Check if they form a connected subtree. If yes, done.\n\n3. If not, find the minimal number of lower nodes to add to make them connected.\n\nBut the problem is that adding a node increases the size beyond s.\n\nWait, no, because the size of the subtree must be exactly s.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal subtree that connects all top s nodes has a size m. If m <= s, then the subtree can be formed by the top s nodes, and some of the lower nodes are excluded. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the connected subtree that includes as many of the top s nodes as possible, and the sum is maximized.\n\nBut again, the question is how to model this.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nWe can model the problem as finding a connected subtree of size s that includes the maximum possible sum.\n\nEach node has a value 2^i, so higher i is better.\n\nThe optimal subtree will include the s highest possible nodes that can be connected.\n\nSo, the approach is to find a subtree that includes as many of the s highest nodes as possible, and includes the minimal number of lower nodes needed to connect them.\n\nBut how to find this.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nWe can perform a BFS starting from the highest node and try to include as many high nodes as possible, ensuring that the subtree remains connected and has size s.\n\nBut this seems vague.\n\nAlternative Idea Inspired by Centroid:\n\nPerhaps, the minimal number of nodes to remove is determined by the centroid of the tree, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find a node such that the size of its subtree is as close as possible to s, but not exceeding it. Then, include all nodes in that subtree.\n\nBut again, in the first sample, the subtree of node 2 is size 5, which is larger than s=3. So, perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, but what if s is 3, and the subtree of node 2 is 5. Then, we need to remove 2 nodes from that subtree to get a connected subtree of size 3.\n\nBut that's not possible because the subtree of 2 is 5 nodes, and any connected subset of 3 nodes must include a path that connects them.\n\nBut how.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is:\n\n- Find a subtree of size s.\n\n- Within this subtree, include as many high nodes as possible.\n\nSo, the approach is to find all possible subtrees of size s, compute the sum for each, and choose the maximum.\n\nBut with n up to 1e6, this is impossible.\n\nThus, we need an efficient way to find the optimal subtree.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes all the highest s nodes, but if they are not connected, then we need to include some lower nodes to connect them.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Sort all nodes in decreasing order of their district number.\n\n2. Select the top s nodes.\n\n3. Check if they form a connected subtree.\n\n4. If they do, output them.\n\n5. If not, find the minimal number of lower nodes to include to make them connected.\n\n6. Then, the total number of nodes in the subtree is s + t, where t is the number of added nodes.\n\nBut the problem requires exactly s = n -k nodes.\n\nSo, in step 5, the added nodes are t, which must be such that s + t = n -k.\n\nWait, but this seems conflicting because s is n -k.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the added nodes are part of the top s nodes, but they are not included in the initial selection.\n\nNo, because the top s nodes are the highest.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm stuck and need to look for hints or similar problems.\n\nUpon reflection, this problem resembles the problem of finding a connected subtree of a given size with maximum sum, which is known to be solvable using a greedy approach when the node values are such that higher nodes are exponentially better.\n\nIn this case, the exponential growth of 2^i suggests that the optimal subtree is formed by including as many of the highest-numbered nodes as possible, along with the minimal necessary lower nodes to connect them.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n1. Sort all nodes in decreasing order of their district number.\n\n2. Select the top s nodes.\n\n3. Check if they form a connected subtree.\n\n   a. If yes, output them.\n\n   b. If not, find the minimal number of lower nodes to include to connect them.\n\n4. The resulting set will be the connected subtree.\n\nBut again, how to find the minimal number of lower nodes to include.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of nodes to add is equal to the number of connected components minus one in the induced subgraph of the top s nodes.\n\nBecause, to connect c components, you need to add at least c-1 nodes.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Collect the top s nodes.\n\n2. Create a subgraph induced by these nodes.\n\n3. Find the number of connected components c in this subgraph.\n\n4. The minimal number of nodes to add is (c - 1). These nodes must be the minimal ones that connect the components.\n\n5. The total nodes after adding is s + (c-1) = s + c-1.\n\nBut wait, we need the total to be exactly s.\n\nSo, perhaps this approach is not applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as selecting a connected subtree of size s, which includes as many high nodes as possible.\n\nThus, the process is:\n\n",
