Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. Hmm, let me think about the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, what defines an 'X' in this context? Oh right, the diagonals must all be the same character, and all other squares (not on the diagonals) must be the same different character. Also, n is odd, which means the grid has a clear center.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Read the input correctly. The first line is n, followed by n lines each containing n characters.\n2. Check the diagonals: for both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left), all characters must be the same.\n3. Then, check that all the non-diagonal characters are the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me clarify: the two diagonals must be the same character, and the rest must be another same character but not equal to the diagonal's.\n\nSo, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll extract the two diagonals and see if they're consistent.\n\nFor the main diagonal (let's call it diag1), it consists of grid[i][i] for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nFor the anti-diagonal (diag2), it's grid[i][n-1 -i] for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nI need to check if all elements in diag1 are the same. Similarly for diag2. But also, diag1 and diag2 must be the same character. Because, in an 'X', both diagonals are the same.\n\nOnce I confirm that both diagonals are the same character, I need to look at all other cells (non-diagonal) and ensure they are the same and different from the diagonal.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Check if diag1 is all same and diag2 is all same.\n- If diag1 and diag2 are same, proceed. Else, it's not an X.\n- Then, collect all the non-diagonal cells and see if they are all same and different from diag1/diag2.\n\nWait, but what about when n is 3? Like the sample input where n=3 and it's a valid 'X'. So, for n=3, the four corners are on the diagonals. The center is part of both diagonals.\n\nWait no, in n=3, the center is only part of both diagonals, but in larger n, the diagonals are longer.\n\nSo, for the grid, any cell that is on either diagonal is checked as part of diag1 or diag2. All others must be same and different.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the grid: read n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nThen:\n\nCheck the main diagonal: all elements equal?\n\nSimilarly for the anti-diagonal.\n\nIf main_diag_char != anti_diag_char, then it's NO.\n\nElse, check the rest.\n\nNow, for the rest:\n\nLoop through each cell (i,j). If (i == j) or (i + j == n-1), it's on a diagonal. Else, it's part of the rest.\n\nCollect all such cells' characters. They must all be the same and different from the diagonal character.\n\nWait, but how to handle cases where n is large. For example, n=5, the non-diagonal cells form a sort of frame around the X.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n1. Check if all elements in diag1 are the same. Let's call this c1.\n2. Check if all elements in diag2 are the same. Let's call this c2.\n3. If c1 != c2, output NO.\n4. Else, check all non-diagonal cells: collect their characters. They must all be the same, say c3, and c3 != c1.\n\nAdditionally, we must make sure that all non-diagonal cells are same. So, if any cell not on the diagonals is different, it's invalid.\n\nAlso, what if all non-diagonal cells are same but same as the diagonal? Then it's invalid because they must be different.\n\nSo, let's code these steps.\n\nBut wait, for step 1, how to check if all elements in a diagonal are same? For example, for the main diagonal, loop through each element and compare to the first.\n\nSame for the anti-diagonal.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef is_all_same(diag):\n    if not diag:\n        return False  # but in our case, n >=3, so diagonals have at least one element\n    first = diag[0]\n    for char in diag:\n        if char != first:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nThen, get diag1 and diag2.\n\ndiag",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. The grid must have both diagonals filled with the same character, and all other cells must be filled with a different same character.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the integer `n` which is the size of the grid, followed by reading the grid itself.\n2. **Check Diagonals**: Extract the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left). Check if all elements in both diagonals are the same.\n3. **Compare Diagonals**: Ensure that the characters in both diagonals are the same. If they are not, the grid does not form an 'X'.\n4. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**: Collect all characters from cells that are not on either diagonal. These characters must all be the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndef check_diagonal(grid, n, diag_type):\n    diagonal = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if diag_type == 'main':\n            pos = i\n        else:\n            pos = n - 1 - i\n        diagonal.append(grid[pos])\n    first = diagonal[0]\n    for c in diagonal:\n        if c != first:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nmain_diag_valid = check_diagonal(grid, n, 'main')\nanti_diag_valid = check_diagonal(grid, n, 'anti')\n\nif not (main_diag_valid and anti_diag_valid):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    diag_char = grid[0][0]  # since both diagonals have same char\n    non_diag_chars = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            non_diag_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n    if len(non_diag_chars) == 0:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        first_non_diag = non_diag_chars[0]\n        all_same = True\n        for c in non_diag_chars:\n            if c != first_non_diag:\n                all_same = False\n                break\n        if all_same and (first_non_diag != diag_char):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The grid is read as a list of strings where each string represents a row.\n2. **Diagonal Check Function**: This function checks if all elements in a specified diagonal (main or anti) are the same.\n3. **Main and Anti-Diagonal Check**: We use the diagonal check function for both diagonals. If either is invalid, the grid does not form an 'X'.\n4. **Non-Diagonal Check**: Collect all non-diagonal characters and ensure they are the same and different from the diagonal character. If these conditions are met, the grid forms an 'X'; otherwise, it does not.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the necessary conditions to determine if the grid forms the letter 'X' as described.",
