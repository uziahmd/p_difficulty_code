There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit.

The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and I need to figure out the best approach. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nWe have n spots on a street where we can build houses. Each spot can have a height between 0 and h. The goal is to maximize the profit, which is the sum of squares of each house's height. \n\nBut there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in a certain range [l_i, r_i], the tallest house must be at most x_i. So for each such restriction, the maximum height in that interval can't exceed x_i.\n\nHmm, the challenge is to assign heights to each spot such that all restrictions are satisfied and the profit is maximized.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Since n and m are up to 50, maybe a dynamic programming approach is feasible. Because the constraints are small, even O(n^3) might work.\n\nWait, but what's the state? Maybe the state can represent the current position in the street and some information about the previous constraints that affect future choices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as intervals with constraints, and for each position, the height is determined by the most restrictive constraint that covers it.\n\nYes, because for each spot i, the maximum possible height it can have is the minimum of x_j for all restrictions that include i, and also not exceeding h. But wait, no—because the x_j's may apply to different ranges, and for a particular spot, multiple restrictions may apply. So the height at spot i can't exceed any of the x_j's for restrictions that cover i. So the effective maximum for i is the minimum of x_j over all j where l_j <= i <= r_j, or h if there are none.\n\nBut wait, that's only considering the maximum allowed by each restriction. Also, the height assigned to i must be at most h. So for each spot, the maximum allowed height is min{ x_j for all j where i is in [l_j, r_j] } union h.\n\nWait, no. Because each restriction enforces that in its interval, the maximum height is <= x_i. So for a spot i, any restriction that includes i will impose an upper bound on the height of i. So the maximum possible height for i is the minimum of all x_j's among those restrictions that cover i, but also cannot exceed h.\n\nSo the maximum possible height for i is min( x_j for j where l_j <=i <=r_j ) if there are such j's, else h.\n\nWait, but the problem statement doesn't explicitly say that if a spot is not covered by any restriction, then it's maximum height is h. Oh right, because in the second example, the first spot is 10, which is h.\n\nSo for each spot i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of x_j for all restrictions that include i, or h if there are no such restrictions.\n\nWait, no. Because the restrictions are \"the tallest house from l_i to r_i must be at most x_i\". So for a spot i, any restriction that includes i will impose that the height of i must be <= x_j. So the maximum possible height for i is the minimum of all x_j's for restrictions that include i. But if no restrictions include i, then the maximum is h.\n\nSo for each spot i, the maximum possible height is the minimum of {x_j} for all j where l_j <=i <=r_j, otherwise h.\n\nSo for each spot i, we can precompute the maximum allowed height as follows:\n\nmax_heights[i] = min( x_j for all j where l_j <=i <=r_j ), if there exists any j; else h.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct because if multiple restrictions cover i, the height can't exceed any of them. So the maximum height is the minimum of all applicable x_j's.\n\nWait, no, because each restriction is an upper bound on the maximum in its range. So for a spot i, the maximum possible height is the smallest x_j among all j that include i.\n\nFor example, suppose two restrictions: one says that i is in [2,4], x=5, and another says i is in [3,5], x=6. Then for i=3, the maximum is min(5,6) =5.\n\nSo for each i, we can compute the max possible height as the minimum of x_j across all j that include i.\n\nIf there are no such j, then it's h.\n\nSo the first thing I should do is, for each i, find the minimum x_j among all j where i is in [l_j, r_j]. Let's call this value m_i. Then, the maximum height for i is min(m_i, h). Wait, no. Because m_i is already the minimum of x_j's for j's that include i, so m_i could be less than h. So the maximum height for i is m_i if m_i exists, else h.\n\nWait, no. Because for each i, if there are no j's (no restrictions covering i), then the maximum height is h. Otherwise, it's the minimum x_j over all j covering i.\n\nSo the first step is to compute for each i the maximum possible height it can have. Then, the problem reduces to choosing for each i a height a_i between 0 and max_heights[i], such that the sum of a_i squared is maximized.\n\nBut wait, is that sufficient? Because the way the problem is set up, the sum of a_i squared is to be maximized, given that for each i, a_i <= max_heights[i].\n\nIs that the case? No, wait! Because the restrictions are about the maximum in a range. So if you choose a_i for i in [l_j, r_j], the maximum of a_i in that range must be <= x_j.\n\nSo the earlier approach only considers each i's individual maximum, but it's possible that when you choose a_i's, some other constraints are violated. For example, if for a range [2,3], x=5, but you set a_2=4 and a_3=4, that's fine. But if in another range, say [2,4], x=3, then the maximum in 2-4 would be 4, which is more than 3—so that's invalid.\n\nSo the initial approach of setting each i's a_i to the maximum possible based on individual constraints is incorrect. It doesn't account for the fact that for overlapping ranges, the chosen a_i's must satisfy all the constraints.\n\nAh, right. So the problem is more complex than just computing per spot maximums.\n\nHmm. So how to model the constraints correctly?\n\nThe constraints are that for each restriction [l, r, x], the maximum a_i in l..r is <= x.\n\nSo the problem is similar to a constraint satisfaction problem, where for each interval [l, r], the maximum in that interval must be <= x.\n\nTo maximize the sum of squares, each a_i should be as large as possible, but subject to these constraints.\n\nAn alternative way is to model this as a graph of constraints and find the optimal a_i's.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model that.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a problem where for each interval [l, r], the maximum a_i is at most x. So for each such interval, we can represent it as a constraint that the maximum of a_l ... a_r <= x.\n\nThen, the problem is to choose a_i's within their individual limits (each a_i can be up to h) and subject to all the constraints.\n\nThis is an optimization problem with both individual bounds and maximum constraints on intervals.\n\nHow can we model this?\n\nDynamic programming comes to mind. Since n is up to 50, and for each position, the state can track some information about the maximum in certain ranges.\n\nWait, but what's the state here? Because the constraints involve ranges, which can vary in length and position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to realize that for each position i, the maximum a_i can be as high as possible, but the constraints from the intervals may require that it's lower than some x_j's.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum a_i for each position i is the minimum of x_j's for all j that include i, but also, for any interval that includes i and has a higher x_j, that may impose a higher limit.\n\nWait, no. Because the x_j is a maximum, not a minimum. So the maximum a_i can be as high as the minimum of x_j's for all j that include i.\n\nWait, no. Because if a spot i is covered by multiple intervals, each with their own x_j, then the maximum a_i can't exceed any of those x_j's. So the maximum possible a_i is the minimum of all x_j's for intervals that include i.\n\nWait, yes. So for each i, the maximum a_i can be is the minimum x_j across all j that include i. If there are no such j, then a_i can be up to h.\n\nSo the initial idea is correct. But then why in the sample input 2, the third spot has a_i=7, which is the minimum of x_j's for the two restrictions that cover it.\n\nWait, the second example input is:\n\n4 10 2\n\nRestriction 1: 2-3, x=8\n\nRestriction 2: 3-4, x=7\n\nSo for spot 3, the two x's are 8 and 7. So the minimum is 7, which is why a_3 is 7.\n\nSimilarly, spot 4 is covered by the second restriction, so x=7, hence a_4=7.\n\nSpot 2 is covered only by the first restriction, x=8, so a_2=8.\n\nSpot 1 is not covered by any restriction, so a_1=10.\n\nSo the initial approach seems to fit.\n\nBut wait, why in the first example, the third spot has a_i=2, which is the minimum x_j of 3 and 2 (from restrictions 2 and 3). So that makes sense.\n\nSo the initial approach is to compute for each i the maximum possible a_i as the minimum of x_j's for all j that include i, else h.\n\nBut then, in the problem statement, the constraints are that the maximum in each interval is <= x_j. So if all a_i's are set to their computed maximum, then the constraints are satisfied.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nSuppose for a particular interval [l, r], the maximum a_i in that interval is M. Then, according to our computed a_i's, M is <= x_j for each j that covers i.\n\nWait, no. Because x_j is the x of the restriction j, which is the maximum allowed in j's interval.\n\nWait, but the a_i's are set to the minimum of all x_j's that cover i. So for any interval j, which covers some i's, the a_i's are <= x_j for all i in j's interval.\n\nWait, is that true?\n\nNo. Because j's x_j is the maximum allowed in its own interval. So for any i in [l_j, r_j], a_i is <= min of x_j's for all k where i is in k's interval. So if j is one of those k's, then a_i <= x_j. Therefore, for any i in j's interval, a_i <= x_j. So the maximum a_i in j's interval is <= x_j, which satisfies the constraint.\n\nTherefore, if each a_i is set to the minimum of x_j's for all j that cover i, then all constraints are satisfied.\n\nWait, does that hold?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nEach a_i is the minimum of x_j's for all j where i is in [l_j, r_j]. So for any restriction j, for any i in [l_j, r_j], a_i <= x_j. So the maximum in [l_j, r_j] is <= x_j, which satisfies the restriction.\n\nYes, because for any i in [l_j, r_j], a_i is <= x_j, so the maximum is <= x_j.\n\nSo, if we set a_i to the minimum of all x_j's for j covering i, then all constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where a spot i is covered by multiple restrictions. For example, suppose i is in two restrictions j1 and j2. j1 has x=5, j2 has x=6. Then, a_i is min(5,6)=5. So for any restriction that includes i, like j1, the a_i is <=5, which is <= x_j1=5. For j2, a_i is 5 <=6. So that's okay.\n\nAnother example: i is covered by j1 (x=3), j2 (x=4). a_i is 3. So for j2, the a_i is 3 <=4, which is acceptable.\n\nSo yes, this approach ensures that all constraints are met.\n\nThus, the maximum possible profit is achieved by setting each a_i to the minimum of x_j's for all j that include i, but not exceeding h.\n\nWait, but what about the global maximum h? Because if the minimum of x_j's is larger than h, then a_i can't be more than h. So, the maximum a_i is min( min_xj, h ). But since x_j's are <=h (as per the problem statement, 0<=x_i <=h), the min_xj is <=h. So the a_i is exactly min_xj.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For each spot i, compute the minimum x_j among all restrictions j that include i. Let's call this value min_x_i.\n\n2. Set a_i to min(min_x_i, h).\n\n3. Compute the sum of squares of a_i's.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let's think about whether setting a_i to min_x_i is indeed the optimal choice.\n\nBecause the sum of squares is a convex function, and each a_i is bounded above by min_x_i, which is the maximum possible value a_i can take without violating any constraints.\n\nSince the square function is increasing for non-negative values, the maximum sum is achieved when each a_i is as large as possible, within their constraints.\n\nTherefore, setting each a_i to min_x_i is indeed the optimal choice.\n\nSo the solution is to compute, for each i, the minimal x_j among all restrictions that include i, and set a_i to that value, provided it's <=h. But since x_j's are already <=h, a_i is just that min.\n\nWait, but in the sample input 1, the first spot i=1 is covered by a single restriction j=1 (l=1, r=1, x=1). So a_i=1.\n\nIn the second sample, spot 3 is covered by two restrictions, x=8 and x=7, so a_i=7.\n\nYes, so this approach works.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- For each i from 1 to n:\n\n   - Find all restrictions j where l_j <=i <= r_j.\n\n   - Among those j's, find the minimum x_j. Let's call this min_x_i.\n\n   - a_i = min(min_x_i, h)\n\n   - But since each x_j is <=h, min_x_i is already <=h.\n\n- Sum the squares of a_i's.\n\nBut wait, what about if a spot is not covered by any restrictions? Then min_x_i is undefined. In that case, a_i can be h.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize for each i, min_x_i as h.\n\nThen, for each restriction j, for each i in [l_j, r_j], update min_x_i to be the minimum of current min_x_i and x_j.\n\nWait, that's correct. Because for each i, min_x_i is the minimum x_j across all j that cover i. If i is covered by multiple j's, each contributes their x_j, and the minimum is taken.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nInitialize min_x array as h for all positions.\n\nFor each restriction j:\n\n   For each i from l_j to r_j:\n\n      if x_j < min_x[i]:\n\n          min_x[i] = x_j\n\nOnce all restrictions are processed, for each i, a_i is min_x[i].\n\nCompute sum of squares.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, now the task is to implement this.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nmin_x = [h]*(n+1)  # assuming 1-based indexing.\n\nfor each of the m restrictions:\n\n   l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n   for i in range(l, r+1):\n\n       if x < min_x[i]:\n\n           min_x[i] = x\n\nsum = 0\n\nfor i in 1..n:\n\n   sum += (min_x[i]) **2\n\nprint sum\n\nWait, that's it?\n\nThat seems surprisingly straightforward.\n\nTesting this against the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nInput:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nProcessing:\n\nInitially, min_x[1..3] =3,3,3.\n\nProcessing first restriction: l=1, r=1, x=1.\n\nFor i=1: x=1 <3 → min_x[1]=1.\n\nSecond restriction: l=2, r=2, x=3.\n\ni=2: 3 <3? No, so min_x[2] remains 3.\n\nThird restriction: l=3, r=3, x=2.\n\ni=3: 2 <3 → min_x[3] =2.\n\nSo min_x is [1,3,2]. Sum is 1 +9 +4=14. Correct.\n\nSecond sample:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nInitial min_x [10,10,10,10,10]\n\nProcess first restriction: 2-3, x=8.\n\ni=2: 8<10 → min_x[2]=8.\n\ni=3: 8<10 → min_x[3]=8.\n\nProcess second restriction:3-4, x=7.\n\ni=3:7 <8 → min_x[3] becomes7.\n\ni=4:7 <10 → min_x[4] becomes7.\n\nSo min_x is [10,8,7,7].\n\nSum: 100 +64 +49 +49 = 262. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: what if a spot is covered by multiple restrictions.\n\nE.g., n=2, h=5, m=2.\n\nRestriction 1: 1-2, x=4.\n\nRestriction 2:1-2, x=3.\n\nThen for i=1, min_x is min(4,3) →3.\n\ni=2: same.\n\nSo a_1=3, a_2=3.\n\nSum is 9+9=18.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWhat about when a spot is covered by multiple restrictions with varying x's.\n\nE.g., n=5, m=3.\n\nRestriction 1: 1-5, x=2.\n\nRestriction 2: 3-4, x=5.\n\nRestriction 3:4-5, x=3.\n\nSo for i=1: covered by restriction 1 →x=2.\n\ni=2: covered by restriction 1 →x=2.\n\ni=3: covered by 1 and 2 → min(2,5)=2.\n\ni=4: covered by 1, 2, 3 → min(2,5,3)=2.\n\ni=5: covered by 1 and 3 → min(2,3)=2.\n\nSo all a_i's are 2, except maybe others.\n\nWait, no: wait, i=3 is covered by restriction 1 (x=2), so a_i is 2. But restriction 2 says x=5, but since a_i is already 2, which is <=5, it's okay.\n\nSo yes, the approach holds.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, m=1. l=1, r=1, x=0. Then a_1=0. Profit is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=0. Then a_1=h. Profit h².\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read n, h, m.\n\n- Initialize min_x for each spot to h.\n\n- For each restriction, loop through l to r, updating min_x[i] to min(current value, x).\n\n- Sum the squares of min_x[1..n].\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nWe'll read n, h, m.\n\nThen, create a list min_x of size n+1 (since spots are 1-based?), initializing each to h.\n\nThen for each of m lines:\n\n   read l, r, x.\n\n   for i in range(l, r+1):\n\n       if x < min_x[i]:\n\n           min_x[i] = x\n\nThen compute sum.\n\nIn Python, the code would be something like:\n\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nmin_x = [h] * (n + 1)  # indexes 0..n, but 0 unused\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    for i in range(l, r + 1):\n        if x < min_x[i]:\n            min_x[i] = x\ntotal = sum(a * a for a in min_x[1:n+1])\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but the output in the sample is '14' and '262'. So the code should print the integer as a string.\n\nYes, the code computes total as an integer, then prints it.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1 → updates i=1.\n\n2 2 3 → i=2.\n\n3 3 2 → i=3.\n\nmin_x is [3,1,3,2].\n\nSum is 1+9+4=14.\n\nSample 2:\n\n4 10 2.\n\nRestrictions: 2-3,8 and 3-4,7.\n\nAfter processing, min_x for 2 is 8, 3 is 7, 4 is7, 1 is10.\n\nSum is 10² +8²+7²+7²= 100+64+49+49=262.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit possible from building houses on a street with given constraints. Each house can have a height between 0 and a specified maximum, and certain restrictions limit the maximum height within specific intervals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - We have `n` spots on a street where each spot can have a house with a height between 0 and `h`.\n   - There are `m` restrictions, each specifying that the tallest house in a given interval must not exceed a certain height.\n   - The goal is to maximize the profit, which is the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses built.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - For each spot, the maximum allowed height is determined by the most restrictive restriction that covers it.
