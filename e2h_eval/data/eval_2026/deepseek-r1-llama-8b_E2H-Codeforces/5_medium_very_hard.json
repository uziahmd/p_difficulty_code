Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem called Colored Boots. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem says that there are n left boots and n right boots. Each boot has a color represented by a lowercase letter or a question mark. Two boots can form a pair if their colors are compatible. Compatibility is when both are the same specific color, or one is a question mark.\n\nI need to find the maximum number of such pairs, ensuring that each boot is used at most once. Also, I have to output the pairs along with their indices.\n\nHmm, so how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, let's think about the structure. For each left boot, I want to find a right boot that is compatible. But since each right can be paired only once, it's a bipartite matching problem where edges exist between left and right boots based on compatibility, and we need the maximum matching.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 150,000. A standard maximum bipartite matching algorithm like the Hungarian method would be way too slow for that. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the compatibility:\n\n- If a left boot is '?', it can pair with any right boot (including other '?'s).\n- Similarly, a right boot '?' can pair with any left boot.\n- For specific colors, only the same color or a '?' can pair.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal way is to count the number of each color in left and right, and then for each color c, the minimum of left_count[c] and right_count[c] can form pairs. Additionally, the remaining '?' in left can pair with the remaining '?' in right.\n\nWait, but maybe not exactly. Because '?' can also pair with specific colors, which might allow for more optimal pairings.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the maximum number of pairs is the sum over all possible color combinations, including the question marks.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Let's think differently.\n\nWhat if I model the problem as a bipartite graph where each left node is connected to right nodes it's compatible with, and then find a maximum matching? But with n up to 1.5e5, that's impossible.\n\nSo I need an O(n) or O(26n) solution.\n\nAnother idea: group the left and right boots by their color. Then, for each color c, the maximum possible pairs between left c and right c is min(left_c, right_c). Also, for the remaining left and right that are '?', we can pair them as much as possible.\n\nWait, but what about the '?''s? Because a '?' in left can pair with any right, including non-'?' and other left '?'s.\n\nSo maybe the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of left boots for each color (including '?') and similarly for right boots.\n\n2. For each color c (excluding '?'), the number of pairs is the minimum of left_c and right_c. Subtract these from both left and right counts.\n\n3. Then, handle the '?' cases. The total '?' in left plus the total '?' in right can be paired as follows:\n   - The left '?' can pair with the right '?'.\n   - Also, any remaining left '?' can pair with any remaining right (non-'?').\n\nWait, no. Because after step 2, the right may have some non-'?' that are not paired yet. So perhaps the correct way is:\n\nAfter handling all the non-'?' pairs, the remaining left and right can include '?' and unpaired non-'?'. So the remaining left and right can be considered as two groups: L = sum of left_remaining (including '?'), R = sum of right_remaining (including '?'). The maximum number of pairs between them is the minimum of L and R. But also, the '?' in L can pair with any in R.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because if a left is '?', it can pair with any right. So the maximum possible between the remaining is min(L, R).\n\nBut how does that affect the overall count?\n\nWait, let's take an example.\n\nSuppose after step 2, the left has 10 '?', and the right has 15 'a's and 5 '?'. The right has 20 in total (15+5). So the L is 10, R is 20. So the maximum is 10 pairs. How?\n\nThe 10 left '?' can each pair with a right, either 'a' or '?'. But since the right has 15 'a's, which are not '?', the left '?' can't pair with them unless the right allows it.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the left '?' can pair with any right, regardless of the right's color. So in this case, the left '?' can pair with any of the right's 20. So the maximum possible is 10 pairs, using 10 of the 20 right boots.\n\nSo the total for step 3 would be min(L, R), where L is the sum of left_remaining (including '?'), and R is the sum of right_remaining (including '?').\n\nSo the overall maximum is:\n\nsum over all c (min(left_c, right_c)) + min(left_remaining, right_remaining)\n\nWhere left_remaining is (total_left - sum_c left_c) and same for right_remaining.\n\nWait, but that's not accurate because in the case where after step 2, the left has a certain number of '?', and the right has some specific colors and some '?'. The left '?' can pair with the right's specific colors, but also with the right's '?'.\n\nWait, but no. Because in step 2, we've already taken as many pairs as possible between specific colors. So for the remaining, any left '?' can pair with any remaining right, whether they're specific or '?'.\n\nSo the remaining left and right can be considered together, and the maximum possible is min(left_remaining, right_remaining).\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Create frequency dictionaries for left and right.\n\n2. For each color c (excluding '?'), compute the minimum of left[c] and right[c], add to the result. Subtract these from left and right counts.\n\n3. Then, the remaining left and right are summed (including '?'), and the minimum of those sums is added to the result.\n\nAdditionally, the pairs must be formed in a way that doesn't reuse any boots.\n\nBut the problem requires not only the count but also the actual pairs. So just knowing the count isn't enough; I need to find which specific pairs to choose.\n\nWait, but for the purposes of finding the maximum, perhaps the order in which pairs are chosen doesn't matter, but for outputting, it does.\n\nSo let's focus first on the count.\n\nBut then, how to reconstruct the pairs?\n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is:\n\n- For each color c, pair as many left and right as possible.\n\n- Then, for the remaining left and right, including '?', pair them optimally.\n\nBut the issue is that the '?' can pair with anything, including other specific colors.\n\nWait, but after step 2, the right may have some non-'?' that haven't been paired. But the left '?' can pair with those.\n\nWait, no. Because in step 2, for color c, we took min(left_c, right_c) pairs. So any right that are non-'?' and not part of step 2 are part of the remaining right.\n\nBut for the remaining left and right, the left can be '?', or specific, and the right can be '?', or specific.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model it is:\n\nAfter step 2:\n\nleft_counts = counts of each color in l, excluding '?'\n\nright_counts = counts of each color in r, excluding '?'\n\nleft_remaining = total_left - sum(left_counts.values())\n\nright_remaining = total_right - sum(right_counts.values())\n\nNow, the remaining left can have some '?', and the remaining right can have some '?'. So the maximum possible is min(left_remaining, right_remaining). And for these pairs, each left '?' can be matched with any right, even those that are specific.\n\nBut how to maximize the count?\n\nWait, but perhaps after step 2, the left_remaining includes '?', and the right_remaining includes '?'. So the maximum possible is the minimum of left_remaining and right_remaining.\n\nWait, yes. Because for each pair, a left '?' can match any right (whether '?' or specific). So the maximum is indeed the minimum of the two.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nCompute the sum for each color c (excluding '?') as min(left[c], right[c]).\n\nThen, the sum of the remaining left (including '?') and right (including '?') gives the maximum additional pairs as min(remaining_left, remaining_right).\n\nSo the total is sum_pairs = sum_c + min(remaining_left, remaining_right).\n\nBut now, how to construct the actual pairs?\n\nThis is the tricky part.\n\nWe need to collect all the pairs and make sure that each left and right is used exactly once.\n\nSo, let's think about how to create the list of pairs.\n\nFirst, process each color c (excluding '?'):\n\nTake as many as possible from left and right for each c.\n\nFor example, if left has 3 'a's and right has 5 'a's, then 3 pairs are made.\n\nThese pairs are (each left 'a' index, each right 'a' index), but which ones? We can pair the earliest left 'a's with the earliest right 'a's, or any permutation, as long as each is used once.\n\nBut since the order doesn't matter for maximum count, perhaps it's easiest to collect all the possible pairs for each color and then proceed.\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right, including '?', we need to pair them in a way that uses as many as possible.\n\nBut again, the order matters for the indices, but not the count.\n\nSo, for the remaining left and right, perhaps the best is to pair each left '?' with a right '?'.\n\nBut wait, if the left has x '?', and right has y '?', the maximum is min(x, y). So we can take as many as possible.\n\nBut the remaining left may have some specific colors, and the right may have some specific colors as well.\n\nWait, no. After step 2, the left and right have no more specific colors except for those not processed. Or wait, no: step 2 processed all specific colors, so any remaining in left and right are '?'. Or is that not the case?\n\nNo. Because in step 2, we process each color c, taking min(left[c], right[c]). So for colors other than '?', their counts are subtracted.\n\nSo after step 2, the left and right only have '?' and possibly other colors that were not present in the other's count.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nSuppose left has color 'a':3, right has 'a':5.\n\nStep 2 takes 3 pairs, leaving right 'a':2.\n\nBut the left's 'a' is fully used.\n\nSimilarly, for color 'b': left has 2, right has 4. So step 2 takes 2 pairs, leaving right 'b':2.\n\nNow, after step 2, the left may have some other colors, but those are not present in the right.\n\nWait, no. Because step 2 processes each color, including 'b', so any color not present in either left or right will remain.\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose left has 'a':3, right has 'b':4.\n\nIn step 2, 'a' is processed, but left has 3 'a's, right has 0 'a's. So nothing is added to the sum for 'a'. Similarly, 'b' is not present in left, so nothing is added.\n\nSo after step 2, the left has 3 'a's (since right had 0 'a's), and the right has 4 'b's.\n\nSo in this case, the remaining left has 3 'a's and the right has 4 'b's.\n\nBut 'a' and 'b' are different colors, so the left 'a's cannot pair with the right 'b's.\n\nSo after step 2, the remaining left and right may have specific colors that can't pair with each other.\n\nSo for the remaining, the only way to pair is between left '?' and right '?', but in this example, left has 3 'a's and no '?', right has 4 'b's and no '?'. So no more pairs can be formed.\n\nThus, the sum is 0 from step 3.\n\nSo, the initial approach is correct.\n\nSo, the algorithm steps are:\n\n1. Count the frequency of each color in left and right.\n\n2. For each color c in left and right (excluding '?'), add min(left[c], right[c]) to the result. Subtract these from left and right counts.\n\n3. Now, the remaining left and right consist of:\n\n   a. Left: sum of left_remaining (could include '?')\n\n   b. Right: sum of right_remaining (could include '?')\n\n   The maximum additional pairs is min(remaining_left, remaining_right).\n\n4. So, the total is sum_pairs = sum_c + min(remaining_left, remaining_right).\n\nBut now, how to reconstruct the pairs.\n\nLet's think about how to generate the pairs.\n\nFirst, for each color c:\n\nFor each i in 0..min(left[c], right[c])-1:\n\nPair left[i] with right[i].\n\nWait, but that's one way, but perhaps it's better to pair the earliest possible.\n\nAlternatively, for each color c, collect all the left indices that have color c, and all the right indices that have color c, and pair them in order.\n\nBut to get the pairs, perhaps for each color c, take the first k left c's and the first k right c's, where k is min(left[c], right[c]).\n\nBut perhaps it's better to collect all the possible pairs for each color.\n\nOnce that's done, the remaining left and right are handled by pairing as many '?' as possible.\n\nBut the problem is that after step 2, the left and right may have some specific colors that can't pair with each other, but can they pair with '?'? Like, if a left has a specific color, can it pair with a right that's a '?'\n\nYes, because '?' is compatible with any color.\n\nSo, for the remaining left and right, including specific colors and '?':\n\nThe left can have some specific colors (say, 'a' and 'b') and some '?'; the right can have some specific colors and some '?'.\n\nBut since the specific colors can't pair among themselves (like 'a' can't pair with 'b'), the only way to pair them is:\n\n- Pair left '?' with right '?'.\n\n- Pair left specific colors with right '?'.\n\n- Pair right specific colors with left '?'.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, but after step 2, the left and right have specific colors that couldn't be paired before.\n\nBut these specific colors could still be paired with '?' in the remaining.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n- After step 2, for the remaining left and right, collect all the left boots (including '?') and right boots (including '?').\n\n- Then, for each left boot in the remaining, if it's '?', it can pair with any right boot.\n\nSo the maximum possible is min(remaining_left, remaining_right).\n\nBut how to select which pairs to make.\n\nPerhaps, the way is:\n\n- Collect all the left boots that are remaining (including '?'), sorted by index.\n\n- Collect all the right boots that are remaining (including '?'), sorted by index.\n\n- Then, pair the left's '?' with the right's '?', and if any left's specific remains, pair them with right's '?', and vice versa.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the remaining left and right can be treated as a bipartition, and the maximum matching is min(remaining_left, remaining_right), but how to find which specific pairs to choose.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe a better way is to first collect all the pairs from step 2, then collect the remaining, and for the remaining, pair as many as possible between '?' and others.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\n- For each color c, pair as many as possible.\n\n- Then, for the remaining, count the number of '?' in left and right, and add min of the sum of left_remaining and right_remaining.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because in the remaining, the left may have some specific colors that can pair with right's '?'.\n\nSo the maximum possible is min( (left_remaining + right_remaining ?) ), but no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, no. Because the remaining left can have some specific colors and '?'. Similarly for right.\n\nSo the maximum possible is the sum of the minimum of the left's '?', right's '?', plus the minimum of left's specific and right's specific, but that's not correct.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative approach: the remaining left and right can be treated as a bipartition where:\n\nEach left can pair with any right, regardless of color, because:\n\n- Left's specific can pair with right's '?'\n\n- Right's specific can pair with left's '?'\n\n- Left's '?' can pair with any right.\n\n- Right's '?' can pair with any left.\n\nThus, the maximum possible is min(remaining_left, remaining_right).\n\nBut the problem is that in this scenario, the left's specific can't pair with each other, but they can pair with right's '?'.\n\nSo, for example, if left has 3 'a's and 2 '?', and right has 4 'b's and 1 '?', the maximum possible is min(5,5) =5.\n\nBecause the 3 'a's can pair with the right's '?', and the 2 left '?' can pair with the 1 right '?', but that's not possible because 3+2=5 left, 4+1=5 right.\n\nSo the maximum is 5.\n\nSo, the maximum is min(remaining_left, remaining_right).\n\nThus, the approach is correct.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\n1. Read n, l, r.\n\n2. Compute frequency counts for l and r.\n\n3. For each color c in the union of keys of l and r (excluding '?'), compute k = min(l[c], r[c]), add k to the answer, subtract k from l[c] and r[c].\n\n4. Compute remaining_left = sum of l[c] for all c != '?'\n\n   Compute remaining_right = sum of r[c] for all c != '?'\n\n   Compute qm = min( (total_left - remaining_left), (total_right - remaining_right) )\n\n   Where total_left is n, total_right is n.\n\n   Because remaining_left is the sum of l[c] for c != '?', which is the specific colors. So the number of '?' in l is n - remaining_left.\n\n   Similarly for right.\n\n   So the number of '?' in left is n - remaining_left.\n\n   The number of '?' in right is n - remaining_right.\n\n   So the maximum additional is min( (n - remaining_left), (n - remaining_right) ) + min( (n - remaining_left - (n - remaining_left)), ... )\n\n   Wait, no. Because the remaining_left is the sum of specific colors.\n\n   So the number of '?' in left is (n - remaining_left).\n\n   Similarly for right: (n - remaining_right).\n\n   So the maximum number of '?' pairs is min( (n - remaining_left), (n - remaining_right) ).\n\n   Additionally, the left's specific can pair with the right's '?' and vice versa.\n\n   So the maximum is the sum of:\n\n   a) min( (n - remaining_left), (n - remaining_right) )\n\n   b) min( (n - remaining_left), remaining_right_non_question )\n\n   c) min( (n - remaining_right), remaining_left_non_question )\n\n   Wait, but that's getting complicated.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the maximum is the minimum of (number of left_remaining + number of right_remaining ?), but that's not correct.\n\n   Wait, perhaps the correct way is that the remaining left and right can be paired as follows:\n\n   The number of pairs is min( (n - remaining_left), (n - remaining_right) ) \n\n   Plus min( (n - remaining_left), (n - remaining_right) )\n\n   Wait, no.\n\n   Alternatively, the maximum is min( (n - remaining_left), (n - remaining_right) ) + min( (n - remaining_left), (n - remaining_right) )\n\n   No, that's adding the same thing twice.\n\n   Hmm.\n\n   Maybe the maximum is the sum of the '?' in left and right, and the specific in left can pair with specific in right.\n\n   Wait, no. Because after step 2, the specific in left can't pair with specific in right, except for the '?' in left and right.\n\n   So perhaps the maximum is the sum of:\n\n   - The number of '?' in left multiplied by the number of '?' in right.\n\n   But that's not correct.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the maximum is min( (n - remaining_left), (n - remaining_right) ) + min( remaining_left, remaining_right )\n\n   Wait, no. Because the remaining_left is the sum of specific in left, and remaining_right is sum of specific in right.\n\n   But specific can't pair with specific unless they are the same.\n\n   So perhaps the maximum is the min( (n - remaining_left), (n - remaining_right) )\n\n   Because each '?' in left can pair with any '?' in right.\n\n   So the maximum is min( (n - remaining_left), (n - remaining_right) )\n\n   Because:\n\n   - The number of '?' in left is (n - remaining_left)\n\n   - The number of '?' in right is (n - remaining_right)\n\n   So the maximum possible pairs between them is min(a, b), where a and b are the counts of '?' in left and right.\n\n   Then, any remaining left (specific) can pair with any remaining right (specific or '?'), but since specific can't pair with each other, perhaps the only way is to pair them with the right's '?'.\n\n   So the total would be:\n\n   (a) min(a, b) \n\n   + (b) min(remaining_left, (n - remaining_right) )\n\n   + (c) min( remaining_right, (n - remaining_left) )\n\n   But wait, this can't be right because (a) + (b) + (c) could exceed the remaining.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the maximum is the sum of min(a, b) + min(remaining_left, remaining_right) ?\n\n   No, because the remaining_left and remaining_right may not have any '?'.\n\n   I'm getting stuck.\n\n   Let's try to model this with an example.\n\nExample 1:\n\nn = 5\n\nl = \"a?ab?\"\n\nr = \"?bab?\"\n\nSo l: a:2, ?:2\n\nr: ?:2, b:2, a:1\n\nStep 2: process each color.\n\nFor a: left has 2, right has 1. So add 1 pair.\n\nFor b: left has 0, right has 2. So add 0.\n\nFor ?: not processed in step 2.\n\nAfter step 2:\n\nl's remaining a:1, ?:2\n\nr's remaining a:0, b:2, ?:2.\n\nWait, no: after step 2, for each color, we subtract min(left[c], right[c]).\n\nSo for a: l[a] was 2, right[a] was 1. So subtract 1 from both. So l[a] becomes 1, right[a] 0.\n\nFor b: left has 0, right has 2. Subtract 0, so no change.\n\nFor '?': step 2 doesn't process it.\n\nSo remaining_left = sum of l's specific colors: 1 (a) + 2 (?) = 3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, remaining_left is the sum of l's specific colors, which is 1 (a).\n\nBecause l's specific colors (excluding '?') are a:1.\n\nr's specific colors (excluding '?') are b:2.\n\nSo remaining_left = 1, remaining_right = 2.\n\nNumber of '?' in left: 2.\n\nNumber of '?' in right: 2.\n\nSo step 3:\n\nmax_pairs = min( (n - remaining_left), (n - remaining_right) ) = min(5-1=4, 5-2=3) → 3.\n\nSo total is 1 + 3 =4.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nWait, what are the actual pairs:\n\nFrom step 2: 1 pair of a and a.\n\nRemaining left: 1 a, 2 ?.\n\nRemaining right: 2 b, 2 ?.\n\nThe maximum is 3.\n\nHow?\n\nWe can pair the 2 ? in left with 2 ? in right: 2 pairs.\n\nAnd then, the 1 a in left can pair with one of the 2 b in right: 1 pair.\n\nTotal 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=3\n\nl = \"???\"\n\nr = \"???\"\n\nStep 2: no color processed.\n\nSo remaining_left = 0 (since all are '?'), remaining_right=0.\n\nnumber of '?' in left:3, in right:3.\n\nstep3: min(3,3) =3.\n\nSo total is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=4\n\nl: \"a?a?\"\n\nr: \"?a?b\"\n\nl counts: a:2, ?:1.\n\nr counts: ?:2, a:1, b:1.\n\nStep2: process a: min(2,1)=1. So add 1.\n\nProcess b: left has 0, right has 1. Add 0.\n\nremaining_left: a:1, ?:1.\n\nremaining_right: a:0, b:1, ?:2.\n\nnumber of '?' in left:1, right:2.\n\nSo step3: min(1,2)=1.\n\nTotal pairs:1+1=2.\n\nBut what about the a in left: it can pair with the b in right.\n\nSo after step 2, we have:\n\nLeft: a:1, ?:1.\n\nRight: b:1, ?:2.\n\nSo the a can pair with the b? No, because a and b are different.\n\nWait, no, because after step 2, the right has a:0, b:1.\n\nSo the left a can't pair with right a, but can it pair with right b?\n\nNo, because a and b are different, and neither is '?'.\n\nSo no, the a in left can't pair with the b in right.\n\nThus, the maximum is 1 (from step3: the 1 ? in left pairs with 1 ? in right, and the a in left can't pair with anything else.\n\nThus, the total is 1+1=2.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute for each color c (excluding '?'), the min of left and right counts, add to the sum.\n\nCompute the number of '?' in left and right as (n - remaining_left) and (n - remaining_right), respectively.\n\nAdd min of these two to the sum.\n\nThus, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nNow, the next part is reconstructing the pairs.\n\nSo, for the pairs from step2, for each color c, take the first k lefts and the first k rights, where k is min(left[c], right[c]).\n\nBut to get the actual indices, we need to track the positions of each color in l and r.\n\nSo, for each color c in l and r (excluding '?'), collect the indices where l[i] == c and r[i] == c, up to min(left[c], right[c]) times.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach is:\n\nFor each color c, sort the left indices and right indices, and pair them in order.\n\nSo, for each c:\n\n- collect the list of left indices where l[i] == c.\n\n- collect the list of right indices where r[i] == c.\n\n- take the first k elements from each, where k is min(len(left_list), len(right_list)).\n\n- pair each left in left_list[:k] with the corresponding right in right_list[:k].\n\nSimilarly, for the remaining left and right (including '?'), collect all the indices, and pair the first min(remaining_left, remaining_right) of them, but in a way that uses the '?' first.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, for the remaining left and right:\n\n- collect all the left indices (including '?') and right indices (including '?').\n\n- Sort the left indices in increasing order.\n\n- Sort the right indices in increasing order.\n\n- Take the first min(a,b) pairs, where a is the number of left indices, b is the number of right indices.\n\nBut that would pair the earliest left with earliest right, but that may not be the optimal way to use '?'.\n\nBut for the purpose of the problem, any valid pairing is acceptable, as long as the maximum is achieved.\n\nThus, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nNow, implementing this.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l as a string.\n\nRead r as a string.\n\nCompute left_counts and right_counts as dictionaries, counting the occurrences of each character (including '?').\n\nCompute for each color c in left_counts and right_counts:\n\n   if c is '?': skip.\n\n   else:\n\n       k = min(left_counts[c], right_counts.get(c, 0))\n\n       add k to the result.\n\n       subtract k from left_counts[c] and right_counts[c].\n\nCompute the remaining_left = sum of left_counts.values()\n\nremaining_right = sum of right_counts.values()\n\nBut no, because after processing, the left_counts and right_counts may have other colors besides '?', but they are not in the other's counts.\n\nWait, no. Because during step2, for each color c, we process it only if it exists in both left and right.\n\nWait, no. Because in step2, for each color c in the union of left_counts and right_counts (excluding '?'), we take min(left_counts[c], right_counts.get(c,0)).\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to iterate through all possible colors (a-z and '?'), and process each color c.\n\nWait, no. Because for a color c that exists only in left or right, step2 will not process it, as min(left_counts[c], right_counts.get(c,0)) will be zero.\n\nSo, for the code:\n\nInitialize sum_pairs =0.\n\nleft_counts = defaultdict(int)\n\nfor c in l:\n\n    left_counts[c] +=1\n\nright_counts = defaultdict(int)\n\nfor c in r:\n\n    right_counts[c] +=1\n\nprocessed_colors = set(left_counts.keys()).union(set(right_counts.keys()))\n\nfor c in processed_colors:\n\n    if c == '?':\n\n        continue\n\n    lc = left_counts.get(c,0)\n\n    rc = right_counts.get(c,0)\n\n    k = min(lc, rc)\n\n    sum_pairs +=k\n\n    # subtract from left and right counts\n\n    left_counts[c] -=k\n\n    right_counts[c] -=k\n\nNow, compute the number of '?' in left and right.\n\nqm_left = n - sum(left_counts.values())\n\nqm_right = n - sum(right_counts.values())\n\nadditional_pairs = min(qm_left, qm_right)\n\nsum_pairs += additional_pairs\n\nBut wait, no. Because in addition to the '?' pairs, the remaining specific colors can be paired with '?'.\n\nWait, no. Because in the remaining left and right, there are some specific colors that can't pair with each other, but can pair with '?'.\n\nSo, the additional_pairs is min(qm_left, qm_right), but we also need to consider the remaining specific colors.\n\nWait, no. Because the remaining specific colors can be paired with the '?'.\n\nFor example:\n\nAfter step2, left has 1 'a' and 2 '?'.\n\nRight has 3 'b' and 1 '?'.\n\nQM_left is 2, qm_right is1.\n\nSo the additional_pairs is min(2,1)=1.\n\nBut the 1 'a' can pair with the 1 '?' in right.\n\nThus, the total is 1 (from step2) + 1 (additional) =2.\n\nBut according to our previous calculation, it's 1+1=2.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nThus, the code needs to:\n\nAfter step2:\n\nCompute the number of '?' in left: qm_left = n - sum(left_counts.values())\n\nSimilarly for right: qm_right = n - sum(right_counts.values())\n\nadditional_pairs = min(qm_left, qm_right)\n\nsum_pairs += additional_pairs\n\nBut wait, that's not considering that the specific colors can pair with the '?'.\n\nWait, no. Because in the remaining left and right, the specific colors can pair with the right's '?'.\n\nSo, the maximum possible is:\n\nthe number of pairs is min( (qm_left + remaining_left_specific), (qm_right + remaining_right_specific) )\n\nWait, no. Because the specific colors can only pair with '?'.\n\nBut perhaps the maximum is the sum of:\n\n- the min(qm_left, qm_right) → pairs of '?'\n\n- the min(remaining_left_specific, qm_right) → pairs of specific left with right's '?'\n\n- the min(remaining_right_specific, qm_left) → pairs of right's specific with left's '?'\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, no. Because the left's specific can only pair with right's '?'.\n\nThus:\n\nadditional_pairs = min(qm_left, qm_right) + min(remaining_left, qm_right) + min(remaining_right, qm_left)\n\nBut this can't be correct because it may exceed the available.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is min(qm_left + remaining_left, qm_right + remaining_right).\n\nBut that's not correct.\n\nWait, let me think differently.\n\nAfter step2, the remaining left consists of some specific colors and some '?'.\n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nEach specific left can pair with any right '?', and each right specific can pair with any left '?'.\n\nThus, the maximum is:\n\nthe sum of:\n\n- min(qm_left, qm_right): pairs of left ? and right ?.\n\n- min(remaining_left, qm_right): pairs of specific left and right ?.\n\n- min(remaining_right, qm_left): pairs of specific right and left ?.\n\nBut also, the sum of these can't exceed the total remaining left and right.\n\nBut perhaps the correct way is to calculate:\n\navailable_pairs = min( (qm_left + remaining_left), (qm_right + remaining_right) )\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is:\n\nadditional_pairs = min( (qm_left + remaining_left), (qm_right + remaining_right) )\n\nBut that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum is:\n\nthe sum of all possible pairs, which is:\n\nmin( (qm_left + remaining_left), (qm_right + remaining_right) )\n\nBut that's not accurate.\n\nWait, no. Because the specific left can pair with right's '?', which are qm_right.\n\nSo the maximum is:\n\nnumber of left ? + number of left specific = remaining_left_total.\n\nnumber of right ? + number of right specific = remaining_right_total.\n\nThus, the maximum possible is min(remaining_left_total, remaining_right_total).\n\nBecause each left can pair with any right.\n\nSo, the maximum is min( remaining_left_total, remaining_right_total ), where:\n\nremaining_left_total = qm_left + remaining_left.\n\nremaining_right_total = qm_right + remaining_right.\n\nThus, the code should compute:\n\nqm_left = n - sum(left_counts.values())\n\nqm_right = n - sum(right_counts.values())\n\nremaining_left_total = qm_left + (sum(left_counts.values())) → which is n.\n\nWait, no. Because sum(left_counts.values()) is the number of specific left boots, and qm_left is the number of ?.\n\nWait, no. sum(left_counts.values()) is the number of specific left boots, which is (n - qm_left).\n\nSo remaining_left_total = qm_left + (n - qm_left) =n.\n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nThus, the maximum possible is min(n, n) =n.\n\nBut that's not correct.\n\nWait, no. Because after step2, the sum of left_counts is the number of specific left boots, and the same for right.\n\nSo, the remaining left can be paired with the remaining right, but the pairing is limited by the presence of '?'.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible is min( (qm_left + remaining_left), (qm_right + remaining_right) ), but since qm_left + remaining_left = n, and same for right, the maximum is min(n, n)=n.\n\nBut that's not possible because after step2, some specific boots may not be able to pair.\n\nWait, but in reality, any left can pair with any right.\n\nBecause:\n\n- If a left is '?', it can pair with any right (including specific).\n\n- If a left is specific, it can pair with any right that is '?'.\n\nBut a left specific can't pair with a right specific unless they are the same color, which was handled in step2.\n\nThus, the maximum possible is the sum of the minimum of the remaining left and right.\n\nBecause each left can pair with any right.\n\nThus, the maximum is min( (n - sum_left_after_step2), (n - sum_right_after_step2) )\n\nBut since sum_left_after_step2 is the number of specific left, sum_right_after_step2 is the number of specific right.\n\nThus, the maximum is min( (n - sum_left_after_step2), (n - sum_right_after_step2) )\n\nBut since n is the same for both, it's min( (n - sum_left_after_step2), (n - sum_right_after_step2) )\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, after step2:\n\nsum_left_after_step2 = sum(left_counts.values()) → the number of specific left.\n\nsum_right_after_step2 = sum(right_counts.values()) → the number of specific right.\n\nThus, the number of '?' in left is (n - sum_left_after_step2).\n\nThe number of '?' in right is (n - sum_right_after_step2).\n\nSo, the maximum possible is min( (n - sum_left_after_step2), (n - sum_right_after_step2) )\n\nThus, in code:\n\nsum_left_after_step2 = sum(left_counts.values())\n\nsum_right_after_step2 = sum(right_counts.values())\n\nqm_left = n - sum_left_after_step2\n\nqm_right = n - sum_right_after_step2\n\nadditional_pairs = min(qm_left, qm_right)\n\nsum_pairs += additional_pairs\n\nWait, but that's the same as before.\n\nBut in the earlier example, that approach would give 3, but in reality, the maximum is 3.\n\nBut in the example where after step2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots, where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot.
