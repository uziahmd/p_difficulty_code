They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck but let's try to think through it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about a playoff tournament where 2^n teams participate. Each game eliminates one team, so after all games, only one champion remains. The way the tournament proceeds is in phases. In each phase, the teams are paired, and they play games. The outcome of these games depends on the string s given.\n\nThe string s has n characters, each being '0' or '1'. For the i-th character, if it's '0', then in that phase, each match is won by the lower-skilled team. If it's '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nMy task is to find all integers x (from 1 to 2^n) such that there exists a permutation p of skills where the team x wins the tournament.\n\nHmm. So for each possible x, I need to determine if there's a permutation p where x is the champion. Then, collect all such x's and output them in order.\n\nBut how do I model this? Since n can be up to 18, 2^18 is 262144, which is manageable but not trivial. So I need an efficient way to compute for each x whether it can be the champion.\n\nWait, but considering all possible permutations is computationally impossible because the number is (2^n)! which is way too big. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nI remember that in tournaments like this, the structure is similar to a binary heap. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half. So the tournament can be viewed as a series of rounds where in each round, the winners from the previous round are paired again.\n\nSo perhaps we can model the tournament as a series of rounds, each corresponding to a certain phase. Each round, the teams are grouped into matches, and each match winner advances.\n\nThe key is to model for each position in the tournament tree, what constraints are imposed by the string s.\n\nWait, the string s represents the phases from top to bottom. For example, the first character s[0] determines the outcome of the first phase, which has 2^(n-1) games. Then s[1] is the next phase, with 2^(n-2) games, and so on until s[n-1], which is the final phase with 1 game.\n\nEach phase i (0-based) has 2^(n - i - 1) games. Wait, maybe I should clarify the indices. Let me see: the first phase has 2^(n-1) games, which is when i=0. So yes, the i-th phase corresponds to the (i+1)-th position in the string, starting from the first phase.\n\nEach phase's outcomes are determined by s[i]. So for each phase, we can model the required condition on the teams that must win their respective sub-tournaments.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose I have a function that, given a group of teams, returns the necessary conditions on their skills based on the phases.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible x, can we simulate the tournament and see if x can win?\n\nBut simulating for each x is O(2^n * n), which is 2^18 * 18 ≈ 4.7 million operations—manageable, perhaps.\n\nWait, but even 2^18 is 262,144, which is manageable for n=18. But each simulation would need to go through all n phases.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's feasible. So the plan is:\n\nFor each x from 1 to 2^n:\n   Check if there exists a permutation p where x is the champion.\n   If yes, add x to the result list.\n\nBut how do I check if x can be the champion? Because the permutation p must satisfy the conditions given by the string s.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can model this as a bitmask, where each bit represents whether a team can reach a certain stage.\n\nAlternatively, think about the tournament as a binary tree. Each node represents a match, and the leaves are the initial matches. The root is the final match determining the champion.\n\nFor each phase, the way the teams are paired depends on the previous phase's winners. So for phase i, the teams are grouped into matches of size 2^i.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the tournament for each x as a series of constraints on the relative strengths of x and other teams.\n\nEach phase imposes certain constraints on the order of the teams involved. For example, in a phase where s[i] is '0', the lower-skilled team wins. So in each pair, the weaker team must be the one that wins. But wait, no—that's not correct. Because in phase i, all the matches are played, and the winners proceed to the next phase.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in a phase where s[i] is '0', for each match, the lower-skilled team wins. So in each match, the two teams in that match must have their positions such that the lower-skilled one is placed in the match. So in the match, the lower-skilled team will win and proceed.\n\nIn the next phase, those winners are paired again, and the same rule applies.\n\nSo for a particular x, to win the tournament, it needs to win each of its matches in every phase. So for each phase, x must be placed in a match where it can win according to the rules of that phase.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase, x must be in a certain \"group\" where, given the rules of that phase, it can progress.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model for each x the minimal set of teams that must be stronger than x, and the maximal set that must be weaker.\n\nWait, but the exact arrangement is tricky.\n\nAnother approach is to model the tournament as a binary tournament tree. For each x, we can model the path it takes through the tree, ensuring that in each match along that path, x can win according to the phase's rules.\n\nBut the pairing structure is fixed based on the initial bracket. So for each x, the initial bracket is a binary tree where each node is a match, and the leaves are the initial pairs.\n\nWait, the initial bracket is such that in the first phase, the teams are paired as 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, etc. So for 2^3=8 teams, the first phase has 4 matches: 1v2, 3v4,5v6,7v8. The winners of these four matches form the second phase, which has 2 matches: (1/2's winner) vs (3/4's winner), (5/6's winner) vs (7/8's winner). The winners of those go to the final.\n\nSo the structure is a binary tree where each internal node has two children, representing the two matches that feed into it.\n\nSo for each x, the path it takes to become champion is through a specific sequence of matches in this binary tree.\n\nNow, for each phase i (from 0 to n-1), the rules are determined by s[i]. So during phase i, the matches are at level i of the binary tree.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the tournament as a series of rounds, each round corresponding to a phase. The first round is the initial phase with 2^(n-1) matches, the second round has 2^(n-2) matches, etc., down to the last round with 1 match.\n\nIn each round, the teams are paired in a certain way. For the initial round, it's 1vs2, 3vs4, etc. Then, the next round's pairings are the winners of each initial pair, so it's (w1 vs w2), (w3 vs w4), etc., where wi is the winner of the i-th initial pair.\n\nWait, so the pairings in each subsequent phase are determined by the grouping of the previous phase's winners. So the structure is a perfect binary tournament bracket.\n\nTherefore, each x's journey to the final is determined by the initial bracket. So for x to be the champion, it must be the winner of its own initial match, the winner of its quarterfinals, semifinals, etc., up to the final.\n\nBut the key is that in each round, the match's outcome depends on s[i], where i is the phase index.\n\nSo for each phase i, the matches are between groups of 2^i teams, but how exactly are they paired?\n\nWait, perhaps each phase i (starting from 0) has 2^{n-i} matches, each consisting of 2^{i+1} teams from the previous phase. So for phase 0, each match is two teams; phase 1, each match is two groups of two teams, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model each phase as a certain grouping of the teams.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each phase, the teams are arranged in a certain order, and in each match, the winner is determined by s[i].\n\nWait, but the exact pairing is important because it affects which teams x will meet in each round.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe instead, for each x, we can construct a mask representing the required constraints on the permutation p.\n\nBut that feels vague. Another idea is to represent the tournament as a binary tree and for each x, track the required relations with other teams in each match.\n\nBut this might get too complex.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model this as a binary decision tree for each x. For each round, x must beat certain opponents, and those opponents must have certain properties based on s.\n\nBut the problem is that the permutation p is a single array, so all the constraints must be satisfied simultaneously.\n\nAlternative approach: For a given x, can we find a permutation p where x is the champion, respecting all the s[i] rules?\n\nTo model this, perhaps for each phase, we can determine the required order of the teams in their matches.\n\nWait, in phase i, the teams are grouped into matches of size 2^{i+1} (since each match produces one winner). But no, wait, phase i has 2^{n-i} games, each game involving two teams, so the number of teams in phase i is 2^{n-i+1}. Because 2^{n-i} games * 2 = 2^{n-i+1} teams.\n\nHmm, perhaps not. Let me think: phase 0 has 2^{n-1} games, each between 2 teams. So the total teams in phase 0 is 2^{n}.\n\nPhase 1 has 2^{n-2} games, each between 2 teams, which are the winners of phase 0. So the teams in phase 1 are 2^{n-1}, as each phase halves the number of teams.\n\nWait, yes: phase i has 2^{n - i} games, each between two teams, so the number of teams in phase i is 2^{n - i + 1}. Because 2^{n - i} games * 2 = 2^{n -i +1}.\n\nSo the initial phase (phase 0) has 2^{n} teams, phase 1 has 2^{n-1} teams, ..., phase k has 2^{n -k +1} teams, and the last phase (phase n-1) has 2 teams.\n\nSo for each phase i, the teams are arranged into matches of two, and the winners proceed to the next phase.\n\nSo for a given x, in order to win the tournament, it must win each of its matches in each phase.\n\nBut the challenge is figuring out which opponents x could face in each phase, and the constraints on the permutation p.\n\nWait, but the permutation p is arbitrary, except that it must be a permutation. So for x to be the champion, there must exist some permutation where x beats all its required opponents according to the s[i] rules.\n\nSo for each phase i, the matches that x participates in depend on the structure of the tournament bracket.\n\nSo perhaps the key is to model for each x, the path it must take through the bracket, and for each phase along that path, impose constraints on the permutation p.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the tournament as a binary tree, and for each x, the path from x to the root (the final) must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nIn this case, each internal node in the tree represents a match that x must win. For each such match, the outcome depends on the phase in which it occurs.\n\nWait, but the phase corresponds to the depth of the node in the tree. For example, the initial matches (leaves) are in phase 0, their parents are in phase 1, and so on, with the root being in phase n-1.\n\nSo for each match that x must win, we can know the phase i, and thus the rule s[i].\n\nSo for each x, the path from the leaf (initial match) to the root (champion) consists of log2(m) matches, where m is the number of teams (2^n).\n\nIn each step, x must win against its opponent, and the outcome depends on s[i], where i is the phase of that match.\n\nSo for each x, we can model the required constraints on the permutation p:\n\nFor each match along x's path, the two teams involved must satisfy the rule s[i]. For instance, if s[i] is '0', then the lower-skilled team must be x, or the higher-skilled team must be x, depending on the required outcome.\n\nWait, more precisely, in a match during phase i, if s[i] is '0', then the lower-skilled team wins. So in that match, x must be the lower-skilled team. Or if s[i] is '1', then x must be the higher-skilled team.\n\nBut the permutation p is a single permutation, so all these constraints must be satisfied simultaneously.\n\nSo for each x, we can build a directed graph where edges represent the required inequalities between x and other teams, based on the phases x must win.\n\nIf such a graph is consistent (no cycles and all required inequalities are satisfied), then x can be a champion.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nPerhaps, for each x, we can generate all the required inequalities that x must have with other teams, based on the phases it must win.\n\nThen, check if these inequalities can coexist with a permutation p where x is the maximum (or somewhere else, depending on the constraints).\n\nWait, but the permutation p is a permutation of 1..2^n. So each team's skill is unique and ordered.\n\nSo for each x, the required constraints are that in certain matches, x must be the winner according to the phase's rule.\n\nEach such match introduces a constraint on x's relative skill compared to its opponent.\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\nFor each phase i (from 0 to n-1):\n\n- The teams are divided into groups of 2^{i+1} teams, each group containing 2^i matches.\n- In each match, the winner proceeds to the next phase.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: for each phase i, the teams are arranged in a certain way, and each match is between two consecutive teams in this arrangement.\n\nWait, for phase i, the teams are arranged in blocks of size 2^i, and within each block, the matches are between consecutive teams.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. For phase 0, it's straightforward: 1v2, 3v4, etc.\n\nFor phase 1, the winners of phase 0 are arranged into groups of two, and each group plays. So it's the winner of 1v2 vs winner of 3v4, etc.\n\nSimilarly, phase 2 is grouping the phase 1 winners into groups of two, etc.\n\nSo the structure is a binary tree, where each node is a match, and the leaves are the initial matches.\n\nSo for x, the path to the root is determined by the initial bracket. Each step in this path is a match that x must win.\n\nFor each match in x's path, we can determine the phase i, and thus the rule s[i].\n\nSo for each such match, x must be the winner, which depends on s[i]:\n\n- If s[i] is '0', then in that match, x must be the lower-skilled team.\n- If s[i] is '1', then x must be the higher-skilled team.\n\nSo for each such match, x must have a certain relationship with its opponent in that match.\n\nNow, the key is to model all these relationships and check if they are possible within a permutation.\n\nBut how?\n\nEach of these relationships is an inequality: either x < y or x > y. So for each x, we can build a directed graph where edges represent x's required inequalities with other teams.\n\nIf the graph has a valid linear extension (i.e., a permutation that respects all the inequalities), then x is a winning integer.\n\nSo for each x, we can:\n\n1. Determine all the matches x must win in each phase.\n2. For each such match, add an edge to the graph indicating the required inequality.\n3. Check if the graph has a valid linear extension.\n\nBut how to determine the opponents in each match for x?\n\nThat's the crux. Because the opponents in each phase are determined by the structure of the tournament bracket.\n\nSo, for each x, we can precompute the path it would take through the tournament bracket, assuming it wins all matches. Then, for each match along this path, we can find the opponent and determine the required inequality.\n\nWait, but the actual opponents depend on the results of the earlier matches. For example, in phase 0, x's opponent is known (it's the team in the same initial match). But in phase 1, the opponent is determined by the winners of two initial matches.\n\nBut since we're trying to find if x can be the champion, regardless of other teams' placements, perhaps the structure of the tournament ensures that x's path is fixed, regardless of other teams' strengths.\n\nWait, no. Because other teams' strengths affect whether x can reach the next phase, but in our case, we're trying to find if there exists any permutation p where x becomes the champion. So regardless of the other teams' strengths, as long as the constraints imposed by the s string are satisfied, x can be the champion.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate. Because the permutation p must assign the skills such that x's path is successful.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a binary tree where each node is a match, and for each match in x's path, we determine the required inequality with the opponent.\n\nSo, for each x, we can build a graph of required inequalities with other teams, and then check if this graph is acyclic and can be represented in a way compatible with a permutation.\n\nWait, but this graph could have multiple edges, and it's possible that some constraints conflict.\n\nBut how to model this without knowing which teams are in which matches.\n\nHmm.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the tournament structure defines a binary tree, and for each x, the path from x to the root (the final match) is determined by the initial bracket.\n\nEach node on this path represents a match that x must win, and each such match occurs in a certain phase i.\n\nSo for each such match, we can determine the required rule (s[i]), and thus the required inequality between x and its opponent in that match.\n\nThe key insight is that for each x, the set of required inequalities is fixed based on the tournament structure and the string s. So for each x, we can build a set of constraints that must be satisfied by the permutation p.\n\nOnce these constraints are built, we can model this as a directed graph, where an edge from a to b means that a must come before b in the permutation (if a < b, for s[i] = '0', or a > b for s[i] = '1'). Then, checking if this graph has a topological order is sufficient to determine if x can be a champion.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the edges are directed based on the required inequalities. For example, if in a match x must be higher, then x must be greater than its opponent, which implies an edge from x to opponent with weight 'x > opponent'.\n\nBut in terms of the permutation, the permutation must assign a value to x and others such that all these inequalities are satisfied.\n\nWait, but in the permutation, the values are the skills, and the permutation is just the order of the teams. So for a permutation p, p[i] is the skill of the i-th team.\n\nWait, no. The permutation p is a list where p_i is the skill of the i-th team. So for x, p[x-1] is its skill.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify:\n\nEach team is identified by a number from 1 to 2^n. The permutation p is an array where p[i] is the skill of the team with number i+1 (since p is 0-based). So p is a reordering of 1..2^n.\n\nSo for team x, its skill is p[x-1].\n\nSo for x to win a match in phase i, the following must hold:\n\nIf s[i] == '0': x's skill must be less than the opponent's skill. So p[x-1] < p[opponent-1].\n\nIf s[i] == '1': x's skill must be greater than the opponent's skill. So p[x-1] > p[opponent-1].\n\nThese are the constraints that must be satisfied.\n\nThus, for each x, the set of constraints is a collection of inequalities between x and other teams, depending on the path x takes through the tournament.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each x from 1 to 2^n, simulate the tournament and determine the path x would take to the root, assuming x wins all matches.\n\n2. For each match along this path, record the opponent and the required inequality (based on s[i]).\n\n3. Collect all these inequalities into a directed graph where each edge represents a required order between x and its opponent in that match.\n\n4. Check if this graph is a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) and has a topological order. If so, then x can be the champion.\n\nWait, but even if the graph is a DAG, the constraints may not be compatible with a permutation. For example, if x must be less than a and greater than b, but a must be less than b, that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, but the graph is built based on the constraints from the matches x must win. So if the graph is consistent (i.e., no cycles and the constraints are possible), then x can be the champion.\n\nBut how do I compute the required path for x?\n\nBecause the opponents in each phase are determined by the bracket structure, regardless of the skills.\n\nWait, perhaps the path for x is fixed based on the initial bracket. So for x, the initial match is determined by its position, and then each subsequent match is determined by the previous winners.\n\nBut for a given x, its path in the bracket is fixed, regardless of the other teams' skills. So the opponents in each phase are determined by the bracket structure, not by the skills.\n\nThus, for each x, the set of matches it must win is fixed. So the constraints are determined by the structure of the bracket and the string s.\n\nSo the key is to, for each x, find all the opponents it faces in each phase, and for each such phase, note whether x must be higher or lower than the opponent.\n\nOnce these constraints are known, we can model the permutation as a set of inequalities, and check if such a permutation exists.\n\nBut how to find the opponents for each phase in x's path?\n\nThis seems to require modeling the tournament bracket for each x.\n\nWait, perhaps the bracket can be represented as a binary tree, and for each x, we can determine the path to the root by following the winners of each match in the bracket.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bracket can be represented as a list of matches, and for each x, we can simulate which matches it would have to win to reach the final.\n\nWait, but simulating this for each x is possible.\n\nAnother idea: for each x, the path through the bracket can be determined by its initial position.\n\nEach phase i in the bracket has 2^{n - i} matches. For phase i, the matches are grouped into blocks of 2^{i} matches, each block consisting of 2^{i+1} teams.\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, we can compute the sequence of opponents in each phase by looking at how the bracket is structured.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose n=3, so 8 teams. The initial phase (phase 0) has 4 matches:\n\n1v2, 3v4, 5v6, 7v8.\n\nThe winners of these are in phase 1, which has 2 matches:\n\n(w1) v (w2), (w3) v (w4).\n\nThe winners of these are in phase 2, which has 1 match.\n\nSo for x=5, its initial match is 5v6.\n\nSuppose x wins that, then in phase 1, x is in the match against the winner of 3v4.\n\nSo x's path is 5v6 -> (5 or 6) v (winner of 3v4) -> ... etc.\n\nSo for each x, the path can be determined by following the bracket structure.\n\nThus, for each x, the path is fixed. So for x, the opponents in each phase can be determined.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each x in 1..2^n:\n\n   Simulate the tournament, assuming x wins all matches, and collect the opponents in each phase and the required inequality.\n\n   Build a graph of constraints (x must be > or < opponent in each phase's match).\n\n   Check if this graph is feasible (i.e., there exists a permutation p that satisfies all constraints).\n\nIf yes, x is a winning integer.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each x, find all the matches it must win in each phase.\n\n2. For each such match, note the opponent and the required inequality (based on s[i]).\n\n3. Build a directed graph where each edge represents the required order between x and the opponent.\n\n4. Check if this graph can be satisfied by a permutation, i.e., the constraints are consistent and there are no cycles.\n\nBut how to model the required inequalities?\n\nEach match in x's path is in a certain phase i, so s[i] determines the required condition.\n\nFor example, in phase i, if s[i] is '0', x must be the lower-skilled team in that match. So x's skill is less than the opponent's.\n\nIf s[i] is '1', x's skill is higher than the opponent's.\n\nThus, for each such match, we add an edge to the graph that enforces this inequality.\n\nOnce all edges are added, we can model this as a directed graph where edges represent required orderings.\n\nThe problem now reduces to checking if this graph is a DAG and whether a topological sort exists that is consistent with the edges.\n\nWait, but in reality, the graph can have multiple edges. For example, x may have to be less than a, and greater than b. So the graph must not have any cycles and must allow for a valid permutation.\n\nSo the steps for each x are:\n\n- Simulate the path x would take through the tournament bracket.\n\n- For each match along this path, determine the phase i, get s[i], and determine the required inequality between x and the opponent.\n\n- Add this to the constraints.\n\nOnce all constraints are added, check if the constraints can be satisfied by a permutation.\n\nHow to implement this?\n\nFirst, simulate the bracket for each x to find the path.\n\nBut how to find the path? Because the bracket structure is fixed, but the winners are determined by x's progress.\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, the path can be determined by simulating the initial matches.\n\nBut this is time-consuming for large n, but since n is up to 18, 2^18 is manageable.\n\nWait, but for each x, simulating the entire bracket is O(2^n) per x, which for 2^18 x's would be O(4e6 * 2^18) which is way too big.\n\nWait, that's 262,144 * 262,144 = 68 billion operations. That's definitely not feasible.\n\nSo we need a smarter way to find the path for each x without simulating the entire bracket.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative idea: the path for x is determined by its initial position in the bracket. So for each x, we can precompute the entire path it would take through the bracket, assuming it wins all matches.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, the bracket can be considered as a binary tree where each node represents a match. The leaves are the initial matches (phase 0). The internal nodes represent higher phases.\n\nSo for each x, its initial match is in the leaves, and its path to the root is determined by the structure of the binary tree.\n\nThus, for each x, we can compute the path by walking up the binary tree, where each step selects the winner from the left or right child.\n\nBut since x must win all matches, we can assume that x is the winner at each step.\n\nSo for x, the path is fixed as follows:\n\nStart at x's initial match (leaf node). Move up to the parent, treating x as the winner. Repeat until the root.\n\nThus, for each x, the path is uniquely determined by the bracket structure, regardless of the other teams' skills.\n\nSo this allows us to precompute the path for each x.\n\nYes! So this is the key.\n\nSo for each x, the path is fixed as the sequence of matches x must win to become champion.\n\nThus, for each x, we can precompute the sequence of matches it must win, each in a certain phase i.\n\nOnce we have this sequence, for each match, we can determine the opponent and the required inequality based on s[i].\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute for each x, the path through the bracket, collecting for each phase i, the opponent and the required condition (x < opponent or x > opponent).\n\n2. For each x, build a directed graph where edges represent the required inequalities.\n\n3. Check if this graph is a DAG and whether a permutation exists that satisfies all constraints.\n\nBut how to represent the required inequalities?\n\nEach constraint is either x < opponent or x > opponent.\n\nWe can represent this as a directed graph where:\n\n- An edge from a to b with a weight of 'less' means a < b.\n\n- An edge from a to b with a weight of 'greater' means a > b.\n\nWait, but for the purpose of checking if a permutation exists, the constraints can be represented as a directed graph where edges indicate a must be ordered before or after b.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as a directed graph with edges a → b meaning a must be less than b. And edges a → b with a different type for greater than.\n\nAlternatively, for each constraint, we can represent it as a directed edge indicating the required relation.\n\nBut for the purposes of checking if a permutation exists, perhaps it's sufficient to model the constraints as a directed graph and ensure that it's a DAG and that the constraints are consistent.\n\nWait, perhaps the constraints can be represented as a directed graph where each edge u → v signifies that u must be less than v. For the case where s[i] is '1', we add an edge from v to u, indicating v must be less than u.\n\nWait, perhaps that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, for each constraint that x must be greater than y, we can represent it as an edge from y to x. Similarly, for x must be less than y, an edge from x to y.\n\nSo, for each constraint, we add an edge to the graph.\n\nOnce the graph is built, we need to check two things:\n\n1. There are no cycles in the graph. This ensures that the constraints are consistent.\n\n2. The graph can be linearized into a permutation, which requires that the graph is a DAG.\n\nAdditionally, for each node, the in-degree and out-degree must satisfy certain conditions, but since the graph is built based on the constraints, perhaps the main thing is to ensure that the graph is a DAG.\n\nThus, the algorithm becomes:\n\nFor each x in 1..2^n:\n\n   Compute the path through the bracket, collecting for each phase i, the opponent and the required condition (x < opponent or x > opponent).\n\n   For each such condition, add an edge to the graph.\n\n   Check if the graph is a DAG.\n\n   If yes, x is a winning integer.\n\nWait, but this isn't sufficient. Because even if the graph is a DAG, the permutation may not exist if some constraints are conflicting.\n\nWait, no. If the graph is a DAG, then a topological order exists, which can be used to assign the permutation.\n\nBut wait, the graph represents the required inequalities, but the permutation is the ordering of all teams, including those not directly connected by edges.\n\nThus, perhaps the graph is a DAG, but the permutation must also include all other teams in a way that doesn't violate any constraints.\n\nWait, but the constraints only involve x and its opponents in each phase. So for other teams not in x's path, their placement in the permutation is irrelevant as long as they don't create any constraints that conflict.\n\nBut perhaps the constraints are only on x and its opponents, so as long as those are satisfied, the rest can be arranged in any way.\n\nSo the key is to model the constraints correctly.\n\nSo the steps for each x are:\n\n- Find all the opponents x must face in each phase, and the required condition for each.\n\n- For each such opponent, add an edge to the graph: if condition is 'x > opponent', add an edge from x to opponent indicating x must be greater than opponent. If condition is 'x < opponent', add an edge from opponent to x.\n\nWait, no. Because if x must be greater than opponent, then in the permutation, x must come after opponent. So the edge would be from x to opponent, indicating x must be greater than opponent.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the direction of the edge.\n\nIn the context of topological sorting, an edge from a to b means a must come before b. So if x must be greater than opponent, then x must come after opponent. Thus, we can represent this as an edge from x to opponent, meaning x comes after opponent.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in a permutation, if a must be less than b, then in the permutation, a comes before b. So an edge from a to b signifies a < b.\n\nThus, if x must be greater than opponent, then opponent must come before x in the permutation. So the edge is from x to opponent, meaning x must come after opponent.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nIf x must be greater than opponent, then in the permutation, x's position is higher (numerically larger) than opponent's. So, in the permutation array p, p[x-1] > p[opponent-1].\n\nThus, in terms of order, x must come after opponent in the permutation. So the edge is from x to opponent, indicating that x must come after opponent.\n\nSimilarly, if x must be less than opponent, then x comes before opponent, so the edge is from opponent to x.\n\nThus, for each condition:\n\n- If s[i] is '0' (x must be less than opponent): add an edge from opponent to x.\n\n- If s[i] is '1' (x must be greater than opponent): add an edge from x to opponent.\n\nWait, no. Because in phase i, x is facing an opponent, and the condition is based on s[i].\n\nWait, for s[i] = '0', in that match, the lower-skilled team wins. So x must be the lower-skilled, which means x's skill is less than the opponent's.\n\nThus, in the permutation, x must come before opponent (since lower numbers are less than higher numbers). So the edge is from x to opponent.\n\nWait, no. Because if x is less than opponent, then in the permutation, x is placed before opponent. So the edge x → opponent indicates that x must come before opponent.\n\nBut for s[i] = '0', x must be less than opponent, so x comes before opponent.\n\nSimilarly, for s[i] = '1', x must be greater than opponent, so in the permutation, x comes after opponent. So the edge is opponent → x.\n\nThus, for each condition:\n\n- s[i] == '0': x < opponent → x comes before opponent → edge x → opponent.\n\n- s[i] == '1': x > opponent → x comes after opponent → edge opponent → x.\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect.\n\nWait, in a permutation, the order is such that x comes before opponent if x is less than opponent.\n\nBut for the edge representation, an edge from a to b means a must come before b.\n\nThus, for s[i] == '0' (x < opponent), x must come before opponent. So edge x → opponent.\n\nFor s[i] == '1' (x > opponent), x must come after opponent, so opponent must come before x. So edge opponent → x.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, for each match in x's path:\n\n- If s[i] is '0', add an edge from x to opponent.\n\n- If s[i] is '1', add an edge from opponent to x.\n\nOnce all edges are added, we need to check if the graph has any cycles. If it does, x cannot be the champion. Otherwise, x can be the champion.\n\nBut wait, the graph may have multiple edges. For example, if x must be less than a and greater than b, and a must be less than b, that's a cycle and impossible.\n\nBut the graph is built incrementally, adding edges as per the constraints, so if adding an edge creates a cycle, x is invalid.\n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\nFor each x:\n\n   Compute the path through the bracket, collecting for each phase i, the opponent and the required condition.\n\n   For each condition:\n\n      If condition is '0' (x < opponent):\n\n          add an edge from x to opponent.\n\n      Else:\n\n          add an edge from opponent to x.\n\n   Check if the graph has any cycles.\n\n   If no cycles, x is a winning integer.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to, for each x, building a graph based on the constraints and checking for cycles.\n\nNow, the question is: how to efficiently compute the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which integers can be the champion of a playoff tournament based on given game outcomes. The tournament is structured in phases where each phase's outcome is determined by a string `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament is a single-elimination bracket where each phase halves the number of teams until only one champion remains. Each phase has a specific rule: '0' means the lower-skilled team wins, and '1' means the higher-skilled team wins.\n\n2. **Path Simulation**: For each team, simulate its path through the tournament bracket assuming it wins all matches. This path determines the opponents it faces in each phase and the required skill relationships.\n\n3. **Graph Constraints**: Construct a directed graph where edges represent the required skill relationships between the champion team and its opponents in each phase. If the graph contains cycles, the team cannot be the champion.\n\n4. **Cycle Detection**: Check if the graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). If it is, the team can be the champion.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    total_teams = 1 << n\n    for x in range(1, total_teams + 1):\n        visited = [False] * (total_teams + 1)\n        path = []\n        current = x\n\n        while True:\n            if visited[current]:\n                break\n            visited[current] = True\n            path.append((current, 0))\n            pos = (current - 1) >> 1\n            current = (pos >> 1) + 1\n\n        opponent = {}\n        level = 0\n        for node in reversed(path):\n            current, _ = node\n            pos = (current - 1) >> 1\n            next_node = (pos >> 1) + 1\n            if next_node not in visited:\n                opponent[current] = next_node\n                level += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        constraints = {}\n        for i in range(n):\n            if i in opponent:\n                opp = opponent[i]\n                c = s[i]\n                if c == '0':\n                    constraints[(i, opp)] = 'x < opp'\n                else:\n                    constraints[(i, opp)] = 'x > opp'\n\n        in_degree = {}\n        graph = {}\n        cycle = False\n\n        for (phase, opp) in constraints:\n            cond = constraints[(phase, opp)]\n            a, b = opp, phase\n            if cond == 'x < opp':\n                edge = (a, b)\n                if edge not in graph:\n                    graph[edge] = True\n                    in_degree[b] = in_degree.get(b, 0) + 1\n            elif cond == 'x > opp':\n                edge = (b, a)\n                if edge not in graph:\n                    graph[edge] = True\n                    in_degree[a] = in_degree.get(a, 0) + 1\n\n        in_degree_x = 0\n        in_degree_opp = 0\n        for (phase, opp) in constraints:\n            if phase == x:\n                in_degree_x += 1\n            else:\n                in_degree_opp += 1\n\n        queue = deque()\n        for node in graph:\n            u, v = node\n            if in_degree.get(v, 0) == 0:\n                queue.append(v)\n\n        topo_order = []\n        while queue:\n            u = queue.popleft()\n            topo_order.append(u)\n            for v in graph[u]:\n                in_degree[v] -= 1\n                if in_degree[v] == 0:\n                    queue.append(v)\n\n        if len(topo_order) != total_teams:\n            cycle = True\n\n        if not cycle:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, sorted([x] + list(constraints.keys())))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Tournament Path Simulation**: For each team, simulate its path through the bracket to determine the opponents it faces in each phase.\n2. **Graph Construction**: Build a directed graph where edges represent the required skill relationships between the champion and its opponents based on the phase rules.\n3. **Cycle Detection**: Use a topological sort algorithm to check if the graph is a DAG.
