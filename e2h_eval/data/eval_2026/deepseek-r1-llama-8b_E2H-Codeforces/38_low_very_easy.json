    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about directed graphs and something called p-reachable. Hmm, I need to find two things: the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable graph, and then, among all such minimal graphs, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nLet's break down what a p-reachable graph is. An ordered pair (u, v) is unidirectional if u != v, there's a path from u to v, and no path from v to u. So, for the graph to be p-reachable, it must have exactly p such pairs where u < v and they are reachable in both directions? Wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, the definition says that (u, v) is unidirectional if u can reach v but v cannot reach u. So, in a p-reachable graph, there are exactly p such ordered pairs where u < v and u and v are mutually reachable? Or is it that the pair (u, v) is considered when u < v and they are in some relation?\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"p-ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are reachable from each other.\" Oh right! So the p-reachable graph has exactly p ordered pairs where u < v and u can reach v and vice versa. So each such pair is a mutual edge in a way.\n\nWait, no. Because the definition of unidirectional is that u can reach v but v cannot reach u. So for the p-reachable graph, the count is the number of mutual edges where u and v are connected both ways, but since those are not unidirectional, they don't contribute to the p count. So the p is the number of unordered edges where u < v and they are bidirectional reachable.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of strongly connected components. Because in a directed graph, two nodes u and v are in a mutual reachability relationship if they are in the same strongly connected component (SCC). So, each SCC contributes to the count of such pairs.\n\nSo, the total number of such pairs (u, v) with u < v and u and v are mutually reachable is equal to the sum over each SCC S of the number of such pairs within S. Because within an SCC, every node can reach every other node, so for each pair u < v in S, they form one such pair.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a graph where the sum of C(k, 2) for each SCC of size k is exactly p, and we want the minimal number of nodes possible.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the sum of C(k, 2) over all SCCs gives the number of such ordered pairs. So, we need to find the minimal n such that the sum of C(k_i, 2) over all i is equal to p, where n is the sum of all k_i.\n\nAnd to minimize n, we should maximize each C(k_i, 2) as much as possible. Because for a fixed p, the minimal n is achieved by having as few components as possible, each as large as possible.\n\nWait, no. Wait, because C(k, 2) is k*(k-1)/2. For a given sum s = sum of C(k_i, 2), to minimize the sum of k_i, we need to maximize each C(k_i, 2) per unit of k. Because adding more to a k increases the C(k, 2) by more than linearly.\n\nWait, let's think: for a fixed s, how to distribute the sum of k's to minimize the total.\n\nThe function f(k) = k*(k-1)/2 is increasing as k increases. But how does it scale per unit k? For example, for k=1, f(k)=0; k=2, f=1; k=3, f=3; k=4, f=6; etc.\n\nThe derivative (if treated as a continuous function) is f'(k) = (2k-1)/2. So for larger k, each additional node added to a component contributes more to the sum s.\n\nSo to minimize the number of nodes, we should have as few components as possible, each as large as possible.\n\nSo the approach is to represent p as a sum of triangular numbers, where each term is C(k_i, 2), and the sum of k_i is minimized.\n\nSo, the minimal number of nodes is the minimal n such that the sum of C(k_i, 2) equals p, and n is the sum of the k_i.\n\nSo, for example, when p=3:\n\nWe can have one component of size 3: C(3,2)=3. So n=3.\n\nWhen p=4: the options are one component of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and, among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding p-reachable Graph**: A p-reachable graph has exactly `p` ordered pairs `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and both `u` can reach `v` and `v` can reach `u`. This implies that these pairs are mutual and form strongly connected components (SCCs).\n\n2. **Triangular Numbers Insight**: The number of such mutual pairs within an SCC of size `k` is given by the triangular number `C(k, 2) = k*(k-1)/2`. To minimize the number of nodes, we should use as few SCCs as possible, each as large as possible.\n\n3. **Finding Minimum Nodes**: We need to express `p` as a sum of triangular numbers where each term corresponds to an SCC. The goal is to find the minimal sum of `k_i` such that the sum of `C(k_i, 2)` equals `p`.\n\n4. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: Once the minimum nodes are determined, we maximize unidirectional pairs by ensuring each component is a single node, making every possible pair unidirectional.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef compute_min_nodes(p):\n    if p == 0:\n        return (0, 0)\n    # Find the largest k such that C(k, 2) <= p\n    k = 1\n    while True:\n        c = k * (k - 1) // 2\n        if c > p:\n            break\n        k += 1\n    # Now we try to subtract the largest possible C(k,2) from p\n    max_k = k\n    total_nodes = 0\n    remaining_p = p\n    while remaining_p > 0:\n        c = max_k * (max_k - 1) // 2\n        if c > remaining_p:\n            max_k -= 1\n            c = max_k * (max_k - 1) // 2\n        count = min(remaining_p // c, max_k)\n        if count == 0:\n            break\n        total_nodes += count * max_k\n        remaining_p -= count * c\n        max_k = 0  # reset to find next possible k\n    # After that, check if remaining_p is zero\n    if remaining_p != 0:\n        return (-1, -1)\n    else:\n        return (total_nodes, 0)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    p = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    min_nodes, max_uni = compute_min_nodes(p)\n    print(f\"{min_nodes} {max_uni}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe code first checks if `p` is zero, in which case the result is trivial. For non-zero `p`, it iteratively finds the largest SCC size whose triangular number does not exceed `p`. It then determines the minimal number of nodes by summing these sizes, ensuring the sum of their triangular numbers equals `p`. Finally, it returns the minimum nodes and the maximum unidirectional pairs, which is zero in this context.",
