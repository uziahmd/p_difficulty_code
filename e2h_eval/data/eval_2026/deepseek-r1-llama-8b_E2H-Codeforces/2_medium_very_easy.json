Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter 'X'. Hmm, let's think about what the problem says.\n\nThe conditions for it being an X are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter all along.\n2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must be the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nWait, right. So first, I need to check the two main diagonals. For each cell in these diagonals, they should all be the same character. Let's call this the 'X' character.\n\nThen, all the cells that are not on either of these diagonals should be the same and different from the X character.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is n followed by n lines each containing n characters. Oh right, but sometimes the input might have quotes or something? Well, looking at the example, the input seems to be strings with '\\n' separators, so in Python, I'll probably read them as a list of strings.\n\nSo, for each test case, I have to process the grid.\n\nFirst, find out what the main diagonals are. For a square matrix, the main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right, and the anti-diagonal is from top-right to bottom-left.\n\nBut wait, the grid is n x n, and n is odd, so both diagonals will have exactly one cell in the center.\n\nSo for each grid, I need to:\n\n- Check that all the main diagonal cells are the same. Let's say this common character is 'd'.\n- Check that all the anti-diagonal cells are also 'd'.\n- Then, check that all the non-diagonal cells are the same, say 'o', and 'o' is not equal to 'd'.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, output YES; else, NO.\n\nHow to approach this?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read n.\n2. Read the next n lines as the grid.\n3. Extract the main diagonal: cells where row index == column index.\n4. Extract the anti-diagonal: cells where row index + column index == n - 1.\n5. Check if all elements in main diagonal are the same. Let's call this d.\n6. Check if all elements in anti-diagonal are the same and equal to d.\n7. Now, collect all the elements not on either diagonal into a list.\n8. Check if all these elements are the same, and this common element is not equal to d.\n\nIf all these are true, output YES. Else, NO.\n\nWait, but wait: the non-diagonal elements must all be the same and different from d. So yes, that's correct.\n\nLet me think about possible edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=3.\n\nFor the grid:\n\nw s w\ns w s\nw s w\n\nMain diagonal: w, w, w. Anti-diagonal: w, w, w. Non-diagonal: all s. So this would be a YES.\n\nAnother case:\n\nx o o o\no x o o\no o x o\no o o o x\no o o o o o\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's think: main diagonal is x's, anti-diagonal is o's. Wait, no. Wait, for n=5, the main diagonal has positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4). The anti-diagonal is (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0).\n\nIn this case, the main diagonal is x, anti-diagonal is o. So that's a problem because they must all be the same. So this grid wouldn't qualify.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1. But according to the problem statement, n is >=3 and odd, so n can be 3,5,... up to 299.\n\nWhat about when the non-diagonal elements are all same as d? Then it's invalid.\n\nLike, suppose d is 'a', and the non-diagonal are all 'a's. Then condition fails.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nIn Python, the grid is stored as a list of strings. Each string represents a row.\n\nFor each row i, column j:\n\nmain diagonal: i == j.\n\nanti-diagonal: i + j == n-1.\n\nSo, for each grid, iterate over each cell.\n\nCollect the main diagonal into a list, then check if all elements are the same.\n\nSame for the anti-diagonal.\n\nThen, collect all the non-diagonal cells and see if they are all same, and not equal to d.\n\nSo code-wise:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nmain_diag = []\nanti_diag = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j:\n            main_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n        if i + j == n - 1:\n            anti_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n\nCheck if all elements in main_diag are same:\n\ndef all_same(lst):\n    if not lst:\n        return True  # but in our case, for n>=3, both diag have at least one element.\n    first = lst[0]\n    for x in lst[1:]:\n        if x != first:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nd = main_diag[0]\nif not all_same(main_diag) or not all_same(anti_diag) or (d != anti_diag[0]):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Now check non-diagonals\n    non_diag = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if not (i == j or i + j == n-1):\n                non_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n    if len(non_diag) == 0:\n        # Only the two diagonals, which are same. So it's a valid X?\n        # Wait, for n=3, if all are same, like all 'a's, then non-diagonal is empty. So in that case, is it considered an X?\n        # Let's refer to the problem statement.\n\n        # The problem says: \"all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\n        # So if there are no other squares, then it's acceptable? Because the condition is vacuously true.\n\n        # So in this case, the grid is just the two diagonals, which are same. So it's a single line.\n\n        # For example, n=3, all 'a's: main and anti are 'a's. So non-diagonal is empty.\n\n        # So it's a valid X.\n\n        # So in code, if non_diag is empty, it's allowed only if the diagonals are same. So in that case, since non_diag is empty, we don't have to check anything else. So the condition is satisfied.\n\n        # So in code, if non_diag is empty, then proceed to check whether the diagonals are same. If so, then YES.\n\n        # Wait, in our code, the code has already checked that main_diag and anti_diag are all same. So if non_diag is empty, then it's okay.\n\n        # So in this case, the answer is YES.\n\n        # So in the code, after collecting non_diag, if it's empty, and main_diag and anti_diag are same, then it's YES.\n\n    else:\n        o = non_diag[0]\n        if any(x != o for x in non_diag) or o == d:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nWait, no. Because in the case when non_diag is empty, then the non-diagonal cells are all same (trivially), but they must also be different from d.\n\nWait, but in that case, since non_diag is empty, the condition is automatically satisfied because there's nothing to violate it.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nif len(non_diag) == 0:\n    # So, the entire grid is the two diagonals, which are same. So it's a valid X.\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    # Check if all non-diagonal are same and not equal to d.\n    o = non_diag[0]\n    if all(c == o for c in non_diag) and o != d:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in the case where non_diag is empty, it's allowed.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nSo the code structure is:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid.\n\nCollect main_diag and anti_diag.\n\nCheck if all same in main_diag and anti_diag.\n\nIf not, print NO.\n\nElse:\n\nCollect non_diag.\n\nIf non_diag is empty: print YES.\n\nElse, check if all elements in non_diag are same, and different from d.\n\nIf so, print YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the second condition says that the non-diagonal squares must be the same and different from the diagonals.\n\nSo even if non_diag is empty, it's allowed.\n\nSo now, let's code this.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\nxooox\noxoxo\nsoxoo\noxoxo\nxooox\n\nWait, perhaps let me see:\n\nIn this case, the main diagonal is x, o, s, o, x.\n\nWait, no, wait, for n=5, the main diagonal is:\n\nRow 0: [0][0] = x\n\nRow 1: [1][1] = o\n\nRow 2: [2][2] = s\n\nRow 3: [3][3] = o\n\nRow 4: [4][4] = x\n\nSo main_diag is ['x', 'o', 's', 'o', 'x'] → not all same. So condition fails, output NO.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nMain_diag: w, s, w → not all same. So condition fails.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n3\nxpx\np x p\nxpe\n\nWait, perhaps it's:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nWait, main_diag is x, x, e → not same. So condition fails.\n\nSo sample outputs are as given.\n\nSo the code should handle these cases.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid is:\n\naaa\naaa\naaa\n\nMain_diag: a, a, a.\n\nAnti-diag: a, a, a.\n\nNon_diag: all a's.\n\nSo in this case, non_diag is all a's, same as d. So condition fails.\n\nThus, output is NO.\n\nWait, no. Because the non-diagonal cells must be same but different from d. So in this case, since d is 'a' and non-diagonal is 'a's, it's invalid.\n\nSo the code correctly returns NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid is:\n\naba\nbab\naba\n\nMain_diag: a, b, a → not same. So condition fails.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid is:\n\na a a\na a a\na a a\n\nMain_diag: a, a, a. Anti-diag: a, a, a.\n\nNon_diag is empty. So condition is satisfied. So output is YES.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the X is formed when both diagonals are same, and the others are same and different.\n\nIn this case, since non_diag is empty, the condition is satisfied. So output YES.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nAnother test case: n=5.\n\nSuppose main_diag and anti-diag are all 'x's. The non-diagonal cells are all 'o's, which is different.\n\nSo output is YES.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nImplement functions to check if all elements are same.\n\nWait, but for main_diag and anti_diag, since they are lists, we can just check if all elements equal to the first.\n\nSimilarly for non_diag.\n\nSo the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid.\n\nCollect main_diag and anti_diag.\n\nCheck if main_diag and anti_diag are all same, and their first elements are same.\n\nIf not, print NO.\n\nElse, collect non_diag.\n\nIf non_diag is empty: print YES.\n\nElse: check if all are same and not equal to d.\n\nIf yes, print YES; else, NO.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nmain_diag = []\nanti_diag = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j:\n            main_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n        if i + j == n - 1:\n            anti_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n\n# Function to check if all same\ndef all_same(lst):\n    if not lst:\n        return True  # though in our case, main and anti have at least one element each\n    first = lst[0]\n    for x in lst[1:]:\n        if x != first:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nif not all_same(main_diag) or not all_same(anti_diag) or (main_diag[0] != anti_diag[0]):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    d = main_diag[0]\n    non_diag = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if not (i == j or i + j == n - 1):\n                non_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n    if len(non_diag) == 0:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        o = non_diag[0]\n        if all_same(non_diag) and o != d:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nHmm, but wait. What about when the non_diag is empty? Like when n=3 and all cells are part of the diagonals. Then, the code will print YES, which is correct.\n\nAnother thing to consider: for n=1, but n is constrained to be >=3, so no problem.\n\nWait, but in the function all_same, for the main_diag and anti_diag, it's possible that they have length 0? No, because n is at least 3, and for i=j, there's always at least one cell (like for n=3, i=0,j=0; i=1,j=1; i=2,j=2). Similarly for anti_diag.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=5\n\nGrid:\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nMain_diag: x, o, s, o, x → not same. So code prints NO.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nMain_diag: w, s, w → not same. So code prints NO.\n\nWait, but in the sample input given, the second case is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw → which is the first sample input.\n\nWait, no, the sample input provided in the question is:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nSo the sample outputs are 'NO', 'YES', 'NO'.\n\nWait, the second test case is:\n\nn=3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw.\n\nMain_diag is w, s, w → not same. So code will print NO.\n\nWait, but the sample output for that is 'YES'?\n\nWait no, in the sample input provided, the second test case is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw → sample output is 'YES'? Or wait, the user wrote the sample input as:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nAnd the sample outputs are ['NO', 'YES', 'NO'].\n\nWait, so that suggests that the second test case is a YES.\n\nWait, that can't be. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the second test case:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw.\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nw s w\n\ns w s\n\nw s w.\n\nSo main diagonal is [0][0] = 'w', [1][1] = 'w', [2][2] = 'w'. So all same.\n\nAnti-diagonal is [0][2] = 'w', [1][1] = 'w', [2][0] = 'w'. So all same.\n\nSo main_diag and anti_diag are same.\n\nThen, the non-diagonal cells are: (0,1) 's', (1,0) 's', (1,2) 's', (2,1) 's'.\n\nSo non_diag = ['s', 's', 's', 's'] → all same.\n\nAnd 's' != 'w'.\n\nSo in this case, the code should output 'YES'.\n\nAh, I see! So earlier I thought that the main_diag was not same, but in reality, for the second test case, the main_diag is all 'w's.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate.\n\nIn the second test case:\n\ngrid is:\n\nline 0: 'wsw' → 'w', 's', 'w'\n\nline 1: 'sws' → 's', 'w', 's'\n\nline 2: 'wsw' → 'w', 's', 'w'\n\nSo main_diag is:\n\ngrid[0][0] → 'w'\n\ngrid[1][1] → 'w'\n\ngrid[2][2] → 'w'\n\nSo all same.\n\nAnti-diag:\n\ngrid[0][2] → 'w'\n\ngrid[1][1] → 'w'\n\ngrid[2][0] → 'w'\n\nAll same.\n\nSo main_diag and anti_diag are same.\n\nNon_diag is the four 's's, which are same and not equal to 'w'.\n\nThus, code should print 'YES' for this case.\n\nSo the code correctly handles this.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid is:\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\nMain_diag: a, a, a.\n\nAnti_diag: a, a, a.\n\nnon_diag: empty.\n\nSo code returns YES.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid is:\n\naba\n\nbab\n\naba\n\nMain_diag: a, b, a → not same. So code returns NO.\n\nSo, I think the code is correct.\n\nThus, the final code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter 'X'.

If they are not, print \"NO\".\n4. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**: Collect all elements that are not on either diagonal. These elements must all be the same and different from the diagonal elements.
