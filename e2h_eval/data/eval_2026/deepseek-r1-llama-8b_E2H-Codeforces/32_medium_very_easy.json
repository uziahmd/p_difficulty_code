    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. First, I need to understand what happens when we remove each element. For each element, I can compute what the new max and min would be in the remaining array, then calculate the instability and find the minimum among all these possibilities.\n\nBut wait, considering that n can be up to 1e5, iterating through each element and for each, checking the max and min of the remaining elements would be too slow. Because for each element, finding the max and min could take O(n) time, leading to O(n^2), which won't work for 1e5 elements.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way. Let's see. Maybe precompute some structures.\n\nWhat if I sort the array first? Sorting will help because the min and max of the sorted array are at the ends. Then, when I remove an element, I can quickly find the next min and max.\n\nWait, but the original array might not be sorted. So perhaps I should first sort it, and then figure out how removing each element affects the min and max.\n\nWait, but the original array isn't necessarily sorted. So the min and max could be any elements. So sorting might complicate things because when you remove an element, the new min or max could come from elsewhere.\n\nHmm, maybe I can precompute the original min and max, and then for each element, see if it's the current min or max, and then compute the new min and max accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal instability is achieved by either removing the current maximum or the current minimum. Because those are the ones contributing most to the instability.\n\nWait, let's think about the initial instability. It's max(a) - min(a). When we remove an element, the new instability could be less than this.\n\nIf the element removed is either the current max or the current min, then the new max or min might be the second max or second min.\n\nFor example, if I remove the max, the new max is the second max, and the min remains the same. So the new instability is (second_max - min). Similarly, if I remove the min, the new min is the second min, and the max remains the same. The new instability is (max - second_min).\n\nBut what if the element being removed is neither the max nor the min? Then, the new max and min remain the same as before. So the new instability would still be (original_max - original_min), which is worse than the other cases.\n\nWait, no. Because if the element is somewhere in the middle, removing it doesn't change the max or min. So the instability remains the same as before. But since the initial instability is the maximum possible, perhaps removing a non-extreme element doesn't help.\n\nWait, that's not necessarily true. Suppose the array has multiple elements, and the max is 10, min is 1. If I remove an element in the middle, say 5, the instability is still 9. But if I remove the max, which is 10, the new max is maybe 8, so the instability is 8-1=7, which is better.\n\nSo the idea is that to minimize the instability, the best candidates are the elements that are either the current max or the current min. Because removing them might reduce the max or increase the min, thus reducing the overall instability.\n\nBut wait, there's another case: what if the array has multiple elements equal to the max or min. For example, if the array is [3, 3, 7]. The max is 7, min is 3. If I remove one of the 3s, the new array is [3,7], so the instability is 4. If I remove 7, the array becomes [3,3], instability is 0. So removing the max gives a better result.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find the current max and current min.\n\n2. Find the second max and second min.\n\n3. Compute the instability if we remove the max: second_max - min.\n\n4. Compute the instability if we remove the min: max - second_min.\n\n5. The minimal instability is the minimum of all possibilities, including these two, plus perhaps the case where the max and min are the same (but that's only when all elements are the same, so removing any gives zero instability).\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple max elements or multiple min elements?\n\nFor instance, array is [5,5,5,5]. Then, removing any gives a new array with all 5s, so instability is zero.\n\nAnother example: array is [1,2,3,4,5]. Max is 5, min is 1. Second max is 4, second min is 2.\n\nIf I remove the max (5), new max is 4, so instability is 4-1=3.\n\nIf I remove the min (1), new min is 2, so instability is 5-2=3.\n\nIf I remove any other element, say 3, the new array has max 5 and min 1, so instability is 4, which is worse than 3.\n\nSo the minimal instability is 3.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal comes from either removing the max or the min.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Find the global max and min.\n\n- Find the count of max elements and min elements.\n\nIf all elements are the same, then removing any gives zero instability.\n\nOtherwise:\n\nCompute the following:\n\na) If the number of max elements is more than one, then even if we remove one, the max remains the same. So the new instability would be (current_max - current_min). Or wait, no: if the max occurs multiple times, then even if you remove one, the max is still present. So for example, array [3,3,5,5]. Max is 5, min is 3. Removing a 5: the max is still 5. So the new instability is 5-3=2. But if you remove a 3: the new array's min becomes 3 again (since there are others), so the instability is same as before.\n\nWait, no. Let's see: array is [3,3,5,5]. The initial instability is 5-3=2.\n\nIf I remove a 5, the new array is [3,3,5], max is 5, min is 3. Instability is 2.\n\nIf I remove a 3, the new array is [3,5,5], max is 5, min is 3. Instability is 2.\n\nSo in this case, regardless of which element I remove, the instability remains the same as before.\n\nHmm, but according to the previous logic, when the count of max is more than one, removing a max doesn't change the max. So the new instability would be (max - min) = same as before.\n\nSimilarly for min.\n\nSo in such cases, the minimal instability is the same as the original.\n\nBut perhaps there's a case where removing a max that's part of a group reduces the max.\n\nWait, like array [2,3,5,5,5]. The max is 5, min is 2. Suppose I remove one 5. The max remains 5, so the instability is 5-2=3.\n\nBut what if I have [5,5,5,5,6]. Then the max is 6, min is 5. If I remove a 5, the max is still 6, min is 5. So the instability is 1. But if I remove the 6, then the max becomes 5, and min is 5, so instability is 0.\n\nAh, right. So the key is to find the second max and second min.\n\nSo here's the revised plan:\n\nTo compute the minimal instability, consider the following scenarios:\n\n1. Remove the current max. Then, the new max is the second max, and the new min is the original min.\n\n   - The instability is (second_max - min).\n\n2. Remove the current min. Then, the new min is the second min, and the new max is the original max.\n\n   - The instability is (max - second_min).\n\n3. Remove an element that's neither the current max nor the current min. Then, the new max and min remain the same as before, so the instability is (max - min).\n\nBut wait, in the case where the array has multiple max or min elements, removing one doesn't necessarily change the max or min.\n\nFor example, array [3,3,5,5]. The current max is 5, and it appears twice. So, removing one 5 leaves the array with 5 as the max. So the new instability is 5-3=2, same as before.\n\nIn this case, option 1's calculation would be (second_max - min) = 5 -3 =2, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, if the array is [5,5,5], then removing any gives a new array with all 5s, so instability is zero.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n- Compute the original max and min.\n\n- Compute the second max and second min.\n\n- Compute the number of occurrences of the max and min.\n\nIf all elements are the same (max == min), the answer is 0.\n\nElse:\n\n- Option 1: remove one max. The new max is the second max, new min is original min. So instability is (second_max - min).\n\n- Option 2: remove one min. The new min is the second min, new max is original max. So instability is (max - second_min).\n\n- Option 3: remove a non-extreme element. The instability remains (max - min).\n\nWe need to choose the minimal among these options.\n\nWait, but in the case where the max occurs multiple times, then even after removing one, the max remains the same. So option 1's value would be (max - min), same as the original.\n\nSimilarly, if the min occurs multiple times, option 2's value would be (max - min).\n\nSo, in such cases, the minimal instability is min( (max - min), (option1), (option2) ), but perhaps option1 and option2 may not give a better result than (max - min).\n\nSo, how do I compute the second max and second min?\n\nLet me think about how to find them.\n\nI can iterate through the array once to find the max and min. Then, for the second max, I can scan the array again and find the largest number that's less than the max. Similarly for the second min.\n\nAlternatively, during the first scan, I can track the top two max and min values.\n\nYes, that's a good approach.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read the array.\n\n2. If the array has only one element, which is impossible since n >=2.\n\n3. Compute the max and min.\n\n4. Compute the count of max and min in the array.\n\n5. Compute the second_max and second_min.\n\n6. Then, calculate the three options:\n\n   a. Remove a max (if count of max is 1): then the new max is second_max, so option1 = second_max - min.\n\n   b. Remove a min (if count of min is 1): new min is second_min, option2 = max - second_min.\n\n   c. Else, option1 and option2 are both (max - min), because even after removing one max or min, the others are still present.\n\n7. The minimal instability is the minimum between:\n\n   - (max - min) [the case where we remove a non-extreme element]\n\n   - option1 (if applicable)\n\n   - option2 (if applicable)\n\nBut wait, in the case where the array has multiple max or min, removing one doesn't change the max or min. So for option1, if the count of max is more than one, then the new max remains the same. So the option1's value is (max - min), same as original.\n\nSimilarly for option2.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to handle it is:\n\n- For option1, if the count of max is 1, then the new max is second_max, else it remains max.\n\n- Similarly for option2.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nCompute:\n\ncandidate1 = (second_max - min) if (count_max > 1) ? No, wait. Wait, if count_max is 1, then removing the max will make the new max second_max. So in that case, the instability is (second_max - min).\n\nIf count_max is more than 1, then even after removing one, the max remains the same. So candidate1 is (max - min).\n\nSame for candidate2.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif count_max == 1:\n\n    candidate1 = second_max - min\n\nelse:\n\n    candidate1 = max - min\n\nSimilarly for candidate2.\n\nThen, the minimal instability is the minimum between candidate1, candidate2, and (max - min).\n\nBecause in some cases, (max - min) is the best option.\n\nWait, no. Because when you remove a non-extreme element, the instability is (max - min), which is same as the original.\n\nBut the original instability is (max - min). So when you remove a non-extreme, the new instability is same as the original.\n\nSo when you remove a non-extreme, the instability is (max - min).\n\nBut when you remove a max or min, it could be better.\n\nSo the minimal instability is the minimum between (candidate1, candidate2, and (max - min)).\n\nWait, but (max - min) is already included in candidate1 and candidate2 when their counts are more than 1.\n\nSo perhaps the minimal is the minimum of candidate1 and candidate2.\n\nBecause, when you have multiple options, but some of them could be (max - min), which is same as the original.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input:\n\nArray is [1,3,3,7].\n\nmax is 7, count_max is 1.\n\nmin is 1, count_min is 1.\n\nsecond_max is 3.\n\nsecond_min is 3.\n\ncandidate1 = 3 - 1 = 2.\n\ncandidate2 = 7 - 3 =4.\n\nThe third option is (max - min) =6.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nIn the second sample input:\n\n[1,100000].\n\nmax is 100000, count_max is1.\n\nmin is 1, count_min is1.\n\ncandidate1: second_max is 1, so 1 -1=0.\n\ncandidate2: 100000 -1=99999.\n\nSo minimal is 0.\n\nSo the output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: [3,3,5,5].\n\nmax is5, count_max=2.\n\nmin is3, count_min=2.\n\ncandidate1: since count_max>1, candidate1 is 5-3=2.\n\ncandidate2: since count_min>1, candidate2 is5-3=2.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nWhich is correct, because regardless of which element you remove, the new instability is 2.\n\nAnother test case: [5,5,5,5].\n\nmax is5, count_max=4.\n\nmin is5, count_min=4.\n\ncandidate1: 5-5=0.\n\ncandidate2:5-5=0.\n\nso minimal is 0.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCalculate candidate1 and candidate2 as follows.\n\nIf count_max is 1, candidate1 is (second_max - min).\n\nElse, candidate1 is (max - min).\n\nSimilarly, if count_min is1, candidate2 is (max - second_min).\n\nElse, candidate2 is (max - min).\n\nThen, the minimal instability is the minimum between candidate1 and candidate2.\n\nBecause, in the case where you have the option to remove a non-extreme, it's (max - min), which is the same as the original. So, when you compare the two candidates, if one is less than the original, it's better.\n\nBut wait, what if both candidate1 and candidate2 are larger than (max - min)? Then, the best option is to remove a non-extreme, which gives (max - min) as the new instability.\n\nSo, the minimal instability is the minimum between candidate1 and candidate2, but also considering (max - min) as a possible option.\n\nWait, no. Because when you remove a non-extreme, the instability is (max - min), which is same as the original. So, if the original was, say, 10, and candidate1 is 8, candidate2 is 9, then the minimal is 8, which is better than 10.\n\nBut if candidate1 and candidate2 are both higher than 10, then removing a non-extreme gives 10, which is better than any of the candidates.\n\nWait, but in that case, the candidates could be 11 and 12, and the original is 10. So the minimal is 10, which is achieved by removing a non-extreme.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal is min(candidate1, candidate2, (max - min)).\n\nWait, no. Because in the case where you have:\n\nmax =10, min=5.\n\ncandidate1 = 10 -5=5.\n\ncandidate2=10 -5=5.\n\nso the minimal is 5.\n\nWhich is the same as the original.\n\nBut what if the candidate1 and candidate2 are both lower than the original?\n\nLike, for example:\n\narray is [2, 4, 7, 7, 7].\n\nmax is7, count_max=3.\n\nmin is2, count_min=1.\n\ncandidate1: since count_max>1, it's 7-2=5.\n\ncandidate2: since count_min=1, it's (max - second_min). What's the second min? It's 4.\n\nSo candidate2 is 7-4=3.\n\nOriginal instability is 5.\n\nSo the minimal is min(5,3) =3.\n\nWhich is achieved by removing the min.\n\nSo in that case, the minimal is 3.\n\nSo the process is to compute candidate1 and candidate2 as described, then take the minimal between them and the original instability.\n\nWait, no. Because the original instability is (max - min), which is 5. So the minimal is min(candidate1, candidate2, (max - min)).\n\nWait, in that example, (max - min) is 5, candidate1 is5, candidate2 is3. So the minimal is 3.\n\nSo yes, the minimal is the minimum of all three.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nCompute the original instability (ori = max - min).\n\nCompute candidate1: if count_max ==1 → (second_max - min), else (max - min).\n\nCompute candidate2: if count_min ==1 → (max - second_min), else (max - min).\n\nCompute the minimal instability as min(candidate1, candidate2, ori).\n\nWait, but why include ori? Because when you remove a non-extreme, the new instability is same as ori.\n\nSo the minimal could be either candidate1, candidate2, or ori.\n\nWait, but in cases where the array has multiple max or min, then candidate1 and candidate2 could be same as ori. So in that case, the minimal is the min between ori and itself, which is same as ori.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal is min(candidate1, candidate2, ori).\n\nBut wait, in the case where candidate1 is 3, candidate2 is 5, and ori is 6, the minimal is 3.\n\nBut what if candidate1 is 4, candidate2 is 5, and ori is 6. Then the minimal is 4.\n\nWhich is better than the original.\n\nSo yes, the minimal is the minimum between candidate1, candidate2, and ori.\n\nWait, but in the case where candidate1 and candidate2 are both larger than ori.\n\nLike, suppose:\n\narray is [3,3,3,3,3]. Then, max and min are both 3.\n\ncandidate1 and candidate2 are 0, and ori is 0. So minimal is 0.\n\nAnother example: array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7].\n\nmax is7, min is1.\n\ncount_max=1, count_min=1.\n\nsecond_max=6, second_min=2.\n\ncandidate1=6-1=5.\n\ncandidate2=7-2=5.\n\nori=6.\n\nso the minimal is 5, which is better than the original 6.\n\nSo the process works.\n\nSo now, the plan is to implement this.\n\nSo, steps:\n\nRead n and the array.\n\nCompute max_val and min_val.\n\nCompute count_max: the number of times max_val appears.\n\nCompute count_min: the number of times min_val appears.\n\nCompute second_max: the maximum value in the array excluding the max_val.\n\nCompute second_min: the minimum value in the array excluding the min_val.\n\nBut wait, how to compute second_max and second_min correctly?\n\nBecause, when there are multiple max or min, the second_max is the same as max_val.\n\nWait, no. For example, in [3,3,5,5], the max_val is5, count_max=2. The second_max is5.\n\nSo when computing second_max, it's the maximum value in the array that is less than max_val only if count_max is 1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute second_max as the maximum of all elements except one occurrence of max_val.\n\nBut for large n, this could be time-consuming.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nInitialize second_max as negative infinity.\n\nIterate through each element:\n\n   if element < current max_val:\n\n       if element > second_max:\n\n           second_max = element\n\nBut wait, that's not correct. Because if the array has multiple max elements, the second_max is same as max_val.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, if the array is [5,5,5], the second_max should be 5.\n\nBut using the above method, since all elements are 5, the condition element < max_val is false, so second_max remains -infinity.\n\nThat's incorrect.\n\nSo perhaps a better way is to count the number of max elements.\n\nIf the count_max >1, then second_max is max_val.\n\nElse, second_max is the maximum of the rest of the array.\n\nSimilarly for second_min.\n\nSo, the steps for second_max:\n\nif count_max >1:\n\n   second_max = max_val\n\nelse:\n\n   create a new array without one occurrence of max_val, then find the max of this new array.\n\nSimilarly for second_min.\n\nThis way, we can correctly handle cases with multiple max or min.\n\nBut for n=1e5, creating a new array without one occurrence is O(n), which is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, for the case where count_max is 1, we need to find the maximum of the array after removing one max_val.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef find_second_max(arr, max_val, count_max):\n\n    if count_max >1:\n\n        return max_val\n\n    else:\n\n        # find the maximum in arr after removing one occurrence of max_val\n\n        # but how?\n\n        # create a list without one max_val.\n\n        # but perhaps, instead, just scan through the array.\n\n        # since n can be up to 1e5, this is acceptable.\n\n        current_max = -infinity\n\n        found = False\n\n        for num in arr:\n\n            if num == max_val:\n\n                if not found:\n\n                    # skip this one\n\n                    found = True\n\n                    continue\n\n                else:\n\n                    # there are multiple max_vals; but since count_max is 1, this shouldn't happen.\n\n                    pass\n\n            if num > current_max:\n\n                current_max = num\n\n        return current_max\n\nWait, but this code is a bit tricky.\n\nWait, let's think: if count_max is 1, then in the array, there is exactly one max_val. So, when we iterate through the array, the first occurrence of max_val will be skipped (found is set to True), and all others (if any) will not be considered because they are equal to max_val.\n\nWait, but in the array, after the first max_val is skipped, any other max_val is ignored.\n\nBut in reality, the array has exactly one max_val, so the code will find the next highest.\n\nWait, but if the array is [5,5,5], count_max is 3. So, in that case, the function returns 5.\n\nBut if count_max is 1, the function returns the second_max.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle that.\n\nSimilarly for second_min.\n\nSo, in code, for each array:\n\nmax_val = max(arr)\n\nmin_val = min(arr)\n\ncount_max = arr.count(max_val)\n\ncount_min = arr.count(min_val)\n\nThen, compute second_max and second_min as per the above logic.\n\nOnce we have all these values, compute candidate1 and candidate2.\n\ncandidate1:\n\nif count_max ==1:\n\n    candidate1 = second_max - min_val\n\nelse:\n\n    candidate1 = max_val - min_val\n\ncandidate2:\n\nif count_min ==1:\n\n    candidate2 = max_val - second_min\n\nelse:\n\n    candidate2 = max_val - min_val\n\nThen, the minimal instability is the minimum between candidate1, candidate2, and (max_val - min_val).\n\nWait, but in cases where both candidate1 and candidate2 are same as (max_val - min_val), then the minimal is (max_val - min_val).\n\nSo, in code:\n\nminimal = min(candidate1, candidate2, (max_val - min_val))\n\nWait, but that's redundant because (max_val - min_val) is the original instability, which is already considered in the candidates when counts are more than 1.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal is the minimum between candidate1 and candidate2.\n\nBecause, when you have count_max>1, candidate1 is (max_val - min_val), same as the original.\n\nSimilarly for candidate2.\n\nSo, in that case, the minimal is the minimum between candidate1 and candidate2.\n\nWait, but in the case where candidate1 and candidate2 are both higher than the original.\n\nFor example, in the array [3,3,5,5], candidate1 and candidate2 are both 2, same as the original.\n\nSo, the minimal is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7].\n\ncandidate1=5, candidate2=5, original=6.\n\nSo minimal is 5.\n\nSo, the code can compute the minimal as the minimum between candidate1 and candidate2.\n\nBecause, in cases where the original is better, it's considered through candidate1 and candidate2.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal is min(candidate1, candidate2).\n\nBut wait, in the case where the original is better than both candidates.\n\nNo, because when you remove a non-extreme, the instability is same as original.\n\nBut in that case, when you have the option to remove a non-extreme, the new instability is same as original.\n\nSo, in that case, the minimal is the minimum between the candidates and the original.\n\nWait, but in the code, the candidates already account for the possibility of removing a max or min, which may or may not give a better result than the original.\n\nBut what about when the minimal is achieved by removing a non-extreme element?\n\nIn that case, the new instability is same as original.\n\nSo, the minimal instability is the minimum between candidate1, candidate2, and the original.\n\nWait, but the original is (max_val - min_val).\n\nIn the code, when you remove a non-extreme, the new instability is (max_val - min_val), which is same as the original.\n\nSo, in that case, the minimal is the minimum between candidate1, candidate2, and (max_val - min_val).\n\nWait, but when you have count_max>1, candidate1 is (max_val - min_val).\n\nSimilarly for candidate2.\n\nSo, the minimal is the minimum between candidate1 and candidate2, which includes the possibility of the original.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nminimal = min(candidate1, candidate2)\n\nBut wait, let me test this.\n\nTake the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7].\n\ncandidate1=5, candidate2=5, so minimal is5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: array [3,3,5,5].\n\ncandidate1=2, candidate2=2.\n\nSo minimal is 2.\n\nAnother example: array [5,5,5].\n\ncandidate1=0, candidate2=0.\n\nSo minimal is 0.\n\nAnother example: array [1,100000].\n\ncandidate1=0, candidate2=99999.\n\nso minimal is0.\n\nSo, seems correct.\n\nWait, but what if the original instability is better than any of the candidates?\n\nFor example, array [2,2,2,2,4].\n\nmax is4, count_max=1.\n\nsecond_max is2.\n\ncandidate1=2-2=0.\n\ncandidate2=4-2=2.\n\nso minimal is0.\n\nWhich is better than original (4-2=2).\n\nSo, correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\narray [2,2,4,4,4].\n\nmax is4, count_max=3.\n\nmin is2, count_min=2.\n\ncandidate1: since count_max>1, candidate1=4-2=2.\n\ncandidate2: since count_min>1, candidate2=4-2=2.\n\nso minimal is2.\n\nWhich is same as original (4-2=2).\n\nSo, correct.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the minimal instability is the minimum between candidate1 and candidate2.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nCompute candidate1 and candidate2 as described.\n\nReturn the minimal of the two.\n\nBut wait, what if the array has all elements the same?\n\nFor example, array [5,5,5].\n\ncandidate1: count_max=3>1, so candidate1=5-5=0.\n\ncandidate2: count_min=3>1, so candidate2=5-5=0.\n\nSo minimal is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\narray [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8].\n\nmax is8, count_max=1.\n\nsecond_max=7.\n\ncandidate1=7-1=6.\n\ncandidate2: min is1, count_min=1.\n\nsecond_min is2.\n\nso candidate2=8-2=6.\n\nso minimal is6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code should be:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead array.\n\nCompute max_val = max(array).\n\nCompute min_val = min(array).\n\ncount_max = array.count(max_val)\n\ncount_min = array.count(min_val)\n\nif count_max ==1:\n\n    # compute second_max as max of array after removing one max_val.\n\n    # how?\n\n    # create a new list without one occurrence of max_val.\n\n    # but for efficiency, perhaps just scan and find the next max.\n\n    # same for second_min.\n\n    # implement helper functions.\n\n    # helper function to compute second_max.\n\n    def get_second_max(arr, target):\n\n        count = 0\n\n        max_val = target\n\n        second_max = -float('inf')\n\n        for num in arr:\n\n            if num == target:\n\n                count +=1\n\n                if count ==1:\n\n                    continue\n\n                else:\n\n                    # this is the second max, but only if it's bigger than current second_max.\n\n                    if num > second_max:\n\n                        second_max = num\n\n            else:\n\n                if num > second_max:\n\n                    second_max = num\n\n        return second_max\n\n    # similar for second_min.\n\n    # but perhaps, write a helper function.\n\n    # Alternatively, implement for both.\n\n    # So, for second_max:\n\n    temp_max = []\n\n    for num in array:\n\n        if num != max_val:\n\n            temp_max.append(num)\n\n    if len(temp_max) ==0:\n\n        second_max = max_val\n\n    else:\n\n        second_max = max(temp_max)\n\n    # same for second_min.\n\n    # create a temp_min list without one min_val.\n\n    temp_min = []\n\n    for num in array:\n\n        if num != min_val:\n\n            temp_min.append(num)\n\n    if len(temp_min) ==0:\n\n        second_min = min_val\n\n    else:\n\n        second_min = min(temp_min)\n\nelse:\n\n    second_max = max_val\n\n    second_min = min_val\n\ncandidate1 = second_max -

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Extremes**: First, find the maximum and minimum values of the array.\n2. **Count Occurrences**: Determine how many times these maximum and minimum values appear in the array.\n3. **Compute Second Extremes**: If the maximum or minimum value appears only once, compute the second maximum and second minimum values by excluding one occurrence of the respective extreme.\n4. **Calculate Candidates**: Compute the instability if we remove either the maximum or the minimum value. If the maximum or minimum appears multiple times, the new instability remains the same as the original.\n5. **Determine Minimum Instability**: The minimum instability is the smallest value obtained from the candidates calculated in the previous step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\narr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nmax_val = max(arr)\nmin_val = min(arr)\n\ncount_max = arr.count(max_val)\ncount_min = arr.count(min_val)\n\nif count_max == 1:\n    temp_max = []\n    for num in arr:\n        if num != max_val:\n            temp_max.append(num)\n    if len(temp_max) == 0:\n        second_max = max_val\n    else:\n        second_max = max(temp_max)\nelse:\n    second_max = max_val\n\nif count_min == 1:\n    temp_min = []\n    for num in arr:\n        if num != min_val:\n            temp_min.append(num)\n    if len(temp_min) == 0:\n        second_min = min_val\n    else:\n        second_min = min(temp_min)\nelse:\n    second_min = min_val\n\ncandidate1 = second_max - min_val\ncandidate2 = max_val - second_min\n\nminimal = min(candidate1, candidate2)\nprint(minimal)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of elements and the array itself.\n2. **Finding Extremes**: The maximum and minimum values of the array are identified using built-in functions.\n3. **Counting Occurrences**: The number of times the maximum and minimum values appear in the array is counted.\n4. **Second Extremes Calculation**: If the maximum or minimum value appears only once, the second maximum and second minimum are computed by creating a new array excluding one occurrence of the respective extreme.\n5. **Instability Calculation**: The instability is calculated for both scenarios where the maximum or minimum value is removed. The minimum of these two instabilities is then printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum possible instability by considering all relevant scenarios without unnecessary computations, making it suitable for large arrays up to the constraint limits.",
