Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on the sides. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem statement says that Yuri has favorite numbers A, B, C, D where A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. We need to find the number of triangles with integer sides x, y, z such that:\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D\n\nAnd the triangle must be non-degenerate, which means the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since x ≤ y ≤ z, the main condition we need to check is x + y > z because z is the largest side.\n\nSo, the approach is to iterate through all possible valid (x, y, z) triplets and count those that satisfy x + y > z.\n\nBut wait, directly iterating through all possible x, y, z would be computationally expensive, especially since the input can be up to 5e5. So a brute-force approach isn't feasible here; we need an efficient way.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, let's note the constraints:\n\n- x is between A and B (inclusive).\n- y is between B and C (inclusive), but since y >= x (as per the condition x ≤ y), it's from max(x, B) to C.\nWait, no. Wait, the condition says A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So y is at least B, and z is at least C.\n\nSo for each x in [A, B], and for each y in [B, C], and for each z in [C, D], but with x <= y <= z.\n\nBut considering all possible combinations would be O(B^2 * (D - C + 1)), which could be up to (5e5)^3, which is way too big.\n\nWe need a smarter way.\n\nLet me consider the variables:\n\nSince x ≤ y ≤ z, and A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, C ≤ z ≤ D.\n\nSo for each possible z in [C, D], I can compute the number of pairs (x, y) that are within their respective ranges and satisfy x + y > z.\n\nBut even then, if D is 5e5, that's 5e5 iterations, each requiring some computation.\n\nSo for each z, we need to find the number of (x, y) pairs where x is in [A, B], y is in [y_min, y_max], and x + y > z.\n\nWait, but y has to be >= x and >= B, and y <= C.\n\nSo for a fixed z, y can range from max(B, x) to min(C, ...), but perhaps it's easier to fix y first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible z, determine the number of (x, y) pairs that meet the conditions.\n\nLet me think: For a fixed z, x can be from A to B. For each x, y can be from max(x, B) to C, but also y must be such that x + y > z.\n\nHmm, but even that might not be efficient enough. Let's see.\n\nAnother approach: The condition x + y > z can be rewritten as y > z - x. Since y ≥ x and y ≥ B, the lower bound for y is max(x, B, z - x + 1). The upper bound is min(C, something).\n\nWait, for a fixed x, what is the minimum y that satisfies y > z - x? It's y >= (z - x + 1). Also, y must be >= max(x, B), because y >= x and y >= B.\n\nSo for a fixed x, y must be >= max(x, B, z - x + 1), and y <= C.\n\nIf the lower bound is less than or equal to the upper bound, then the number of y's is C - max(x, B, z - x + 1) + 1.\n\nBut how do we handle this efficiently?\n\nWait, maybe for each z, we can precompute the required counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a 2D problem where for each z, we calculate the total number of (x, y) pairs that satisfy x + y > z, x in [A, B], y in [max(x, B), C].\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be broken down into:\n\nFor each z in [C, D], find the number of (x, y) pairs where:\n\nx ∈ [A, B]\ny ∈ [max(x, B), C]\nx + y > z\n\nSo the idea is to loop over each z from C to D, and for each z, compute the count of valid (x, y) pairs.\n\nNow, for each z, the count can be found by:\n\nsum over x in [A, B] of (number of y's >= max(x, B, z - x + 1) and <= C)\n\nBut even this could be O(z_count * x_range), which could be up to 5e5 * 5e5 = 2.5e11 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo we need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative plan: For each x, find the range of z where x + y > z, and accumulate these counts.\n\nWait, perhaps another angle: since z is between C and D, and y is between B and C, and x is between A and B.\n\nBut I'm stuck. Maybe it's better to model the problem differently.\n\nLet me think about the constraints again:\n\nx can be from A to B.\n\ny can be from B to C, but y >= x.\n\nz can be from C to D, but z >= y.\n\nSo for a triplet (x, y, z), we must have z >= y >= x, and x + y > z.\n\nWait, but since z >= y, x + y > z implies that x + y > y → x > 0, which is always true since x >= A >=1.\n\nWait, no. Because z is the largest side, so the triangle condition is x + y > z.\n\nSo the condition is x + y > z.\n\nBut z is at least y, so x + y > y → x > 0, which is always satisfied since x is at least 1.\n\nSo the main condition is x + y > z.\n\nSo for each possible x and y, we need to find the number of z's that are >= y, <= min(D, x + y - 1), and also >= C, because z is in [C, D].\n\nWait, z must be >= max(y, C). But since y is <= C, because y is in [B, C], then z starts at C.\n\nSo for a given x and y, the valid z's are in [C, min(D, x + y - 1)].\n\nSo the number of z's is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y -1 >= C else 0.\n\nSo the total count is the sum over x from A to B, y from max(x, B) to C, of max(0, min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1) if x + y > C else 0.\n\nWait, but since z must be >= C, and also >= y (since y <= C, but z can be y or higher). So the z's start at C, but they have to be <= D and <= x + y - 1.\n\nSo for each x and y, the number of z's is the count of integers z where C <= z <= min(D, x + y -1), provided that x + y > C (because otherwise, there are no such z's).\n\nWait, no. Because if x + y <= C, then x + y -1 < C, so z can't be >= C and <= x+y-1. So the count is zero in that case.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Iterate x from A to B.\n\n2. For each x, iterate y from max(x, B) to C.\n\n3. For each (x, y), compute s = x + y.\n\n   If s <= C: no z exists, so contribute 0.\n\n   Else: compute the lower bound of z as C, upper bound as min(D, s-1). The count is max(0, upper - lower + 1).\n\n   Add this to the total.\n\nThis seems manageable, but with x and y up to 5e5 each, this approach would result in O((B - A + 1)*(C - B + 1)) operations, which could be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 operations. That's way too slow for Python; it's impossible to process that in time.\n\nSo we need a way to calculate this without iterating through every possible x and y.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can find a mathematical way to express the total count.\n\nLet me think about the conditions:\n\nFor x in [A, B], y in [y_min, y_max], where y_min = max(x, B), y_max = C.\n\nWe want to count the number of (x, y) pairs where x + y > C, and then for each such pair, add the number of z's in [C, min(D, x+y-1)].\n\nSo the total is the sum over all x, y (satisfying y >= max(x, B), y <= C) of max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1) if x + y > C else 0.\n\nLet me split this into two parts: whether x + y > C or not.\n\nSo for x and y where x + y > C:\n\nnumber_of_z = max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) \n\nElse: 0.\n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating the sum over all (x, y) in the allowed ranges where x + y > C of (min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1).\n\nLet me denote T = C.\n\nThen, for a given x, y must be >= max(x, B), and y >= T - x + 1 (since x + y > T → y > T - x → y >= T - x + 1).\n\nBut y can't exceed C.\n\nSo for a given x, the minimal y is max(max(x, B), T - x + 1), and the maximum y is C.\n\nIf the minimal y exceeds C, then there are no y's for this x that satisfy x + y > T.\n\nOtherwise, the y's are from y_min to C.\n\nNow, for each x, we can compute the range of y's that satisfy the conditions.\n\nOnce we have the y's, for each such y, the term is (min(D, x + y - 1) - T + 1) if x + y > T.\n\nWait, but x + y is already > T because y >= T - x + 1 → x + y >= T + 1.\n\nSo x + y - 1 >= T → min(D, x + y -1) is either D or x + y - 1, whichever is smaller.\n\nSo for each x, let's compute the y range:\n\ny starts at y_low = max(max(x, B), T - x + 1).\n\nIf y_low > C, then no contribution.\n\nElse, y_high = C.\n\nSo for each x, the y's run from y_low to y_high.\n\nWithin this range, for each y, the contribution is (min(D, x + y - 1) - T + 1).\n\nBut how to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nLet me denote S = x + y - 1.\n\nSo for each y in [y_low, y_high], the contribution is (min(D, S) - T + 1).\n\nWhich is (min(D, x + y - 1) - T + 1) = min(D, x + y -1) - (T - 1).\n\nSo, the term depends on whether x + y -1 <= D.\n\nSo, for each x, the y's can be partitioned into two groups:\n\n1. Those where x + y -1 <= D → contribution is (x + y -1 - T + 1) = x + y - T.\n\n2. Those where x + y -1 > D → contribution is (D - T + 1).\n\nSo for each x, we can compute the number of y's in group 1 and group 2.\n\nSo for x, let's find the point where x + y -1 = D → y = D - x + 1.\n\nSo for y >= y0 = D - x + 1, the contribution is (D - T + 1).\n\nBut y must also be >= y_low and <= y_high.\n\nSo for a given x, we can calculate the lower and upper bounds for y to fall into group 1 or 2.\n\nLet me outline the steps for each x:\n\nCompute y_low = max(max(x, B), T - x + 1).\n\nCompute y_high = C.\n\nIf y_low > y_high: continue.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute y0 = D - x + 1.\n\nWe need to find the y values that are in [y_low, y_high] and also <= y0 (group 1) and those > y0 (group 2).\n\nSo:\n\nif y0 < y_low: all y's are in group 2.\n\nelif y0 > y_high: all y's are in group 1.\n\nelse: part in group 1 (from y_low to y0), part in group 2 (from y0+1 to y_high).\n\nSo for each x:\n\nCase 1: y0 < y_low → all y's are in group 2.\n\nNumber of y's: y_high - y_low + 1.\n\nEach contributes (D - T + 1).\n\nSo contribution for group 2 is (y_high - y_low + 1) * (D - T + 1).\n\nCase 2: y0 > y_high → all y's are in group 1.\n\nNumber of y's: y_high - y_low + 1.\n\nEach contributes (x + y - T).\n\nBut summing x + y for y in [y_low, y_high] can be done using arithmetic series.\n\nSum_x_y = sum_{y=y_low}^{y_high} (x + y) = sum_x + sum_y.\n\nsum_x is (x*(y_high - y_low + 1)).\n\nsum_y is sum from y_low to y_high of y → (y_low + y_high)*(y_high - y_low +1)/2.\n\nSo the total contribution for case 2 is sum_x_y - T * (y_high - y_low +1).\n\nCase 3: y0 is within [y_low, y_high].\n\nThen, the group 1 has y from y_low to y0 → number of y's is y0 - y_low +1.\n\nGroup 2 has y from y0+1 to y_high → number of y's is y_high - (y0 +1) + 1 = y_high - y0.\n\nFor group 1: each contributes x + y - T.\n\nSum for group 1 is sum_{y = y_low}^{y0} (x + y - T) = sum (x - T) + sum y.\n\nsum (x-T) is (x-T)*(y0 - y_low +1).\n\nsum y is (y_low + y0)*(y0 - y_low +1)/2.\n\nTotal for group 1: (x-T)*(count_group1) + (sum y).\n\nFor group 2: each contributes (D - T + 1).\n\nSo contribution for group 2 is (D - T + 1) * count_group2.\n\nThus, the overall contribution for x is the sum of group1 and group2.\n\nSo, putting this together, for each x, we can calculate the contribution based on the position of y0 relative to y_low and y_high.\n\nThis way, each x can be processed in O(1) time, which makes the total time complexity O(B - A + 1), which is acceptable for B up to 5e5.\n\nSo now, the plan is:\n\nLoop x from A to B.\n\nFor each x:\n\nCompute y_low = max(max(x, B), T - x + 1) → where T is C.\n\nCompute y_high = C.\n\nIf y_low > y_high: skip.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute y0 = D - x + 1.\n\nCheck the cases:\n\nCase 1: y0 < y_low → all y in group 2.\n\ncontribution += (y_high - y_low + 1) * (D - T + 1).\n\nCase 2: y0 > y_high → all y in group 1.\n\nCompute sum_x_plus_y = x*(y_high - y_low +1) + (y_low + y_high)*(y_high - y_low +1)//2.\n\ncontribution += sum_x_plus_y - T*(y_high - y_low +1).\n\nCase3: y0 is in [y_low, y_high].\n\nCompute group1_count = y0 - y_low +1.\n\nsum_group1 = (x - T)*group1_count + (y_low + y0)*group1_count // 2.\n\ngroup2_count = y_high - y0.\n\ncontribution += sum_group1 + (D - T +1)*group2_count.\n\nAdd this contribution to the total.\n\nSo, this should allow us to compute the total efficiently.\n\nNow, let's test this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 1 2 3 4\n\nSo A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nT=C=3.\n\nWe loop x from 1 to 2.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ny_low = max(max(1,2), 3 -1 +1) → max(2,3) → 3.\n\ny_high=3.\n\ny0 = D -x +1 =4-1+1=4.\n\nCompare y0 (4) with y_low (3) and y_high (3). So y0> y_high.\n\nSo case 2.\n\nsum_x_plus_y = x*(y_high - y_low +1) + (y_low + y_high)*(y_high - y_low +1)/2.\n\nx=1, y_low=3, y_high=3.\n\nsum_x_plus_y = 1*(1) + (3+3)*1//2 = 1 + 3 =4.\n\nsum_x_plus_y - T*(y_high - y_low +1) =4 -3*1=1.\n\nSo contribution is 1.\n\nFor x=2:\n\ny_low = max(max(2,2), 3-2 +1)= max(2,2) → 2.\n\ny_high=3.\n\ny0=D -2 +1=4-2+1=3.\n\nSo y0=3 is in [2,3].\n\nSo case3.\n\ngroup1_count=3-2+1=2.\n\nsum_group1 = (2-3)*2 + (2+3)*2//2 → (-1)*2 + (5)*1 → -2 +5=3.\n\ngroup2_count=3-3=0.\n\ncontribution +=3 +0=3.\n\nTotal contribution is 1 +3=4. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nInput: 1 2 2 5 → A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nT=C=2.\n\nLoop x from 1 to 2.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ny_low = max( max(1,2), 2 -1 +1 ) → max(2, 2) →2.\n\ny_high=2.\n\ny0 =5-1+1=5.\n\nCase: y0=5> y_high=2 → case2.\n\nsum_x_plus_y = 1*(2-2+1) + (2+2)*(1)/2 →1*(1) + (4)*0.5=1+2=3.\n\nsum_x_plus_y - T*(1) =3-2=1.\n\nContribution 1.\n\nFor x=2:\n\ny_low = max(2,2, 2-2+1=1) → max(2,2,1)=2.\n\ny_high=2.\n\ny0=5-2+1=4.\n\ncase2: y0>2.\n\nsum_x_plus_y=2*(1) + (2+2)*1/2 → 2 + 2=4.\n\nsum minus 2*1=4-2=2.\n\nContribution 2.\n\nTotal is 1+2=3, which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample:\n\n500000 500000 500000 500000.\n\nA=B=C=D=5e5.\n\nT=C=5e5.\n\nx=5e5.\n\ny_low = max(5e5,5e5, 5e5 -5e5 +1) →5e5.\n\ny_high=5e5.\n\ny0 =5e5 -5e5 +1 =1.\n\nWait, no: y0 is D -x +1 =5e5 -5e5 +1=1.\n\ny_low is 5e5, which is larger than y0=1.\n\nSo case1: y0 < y_low.\n\nAll y's are in group2.\n\nNumber of y's is 5e5 -5e5 +1=1.\n\ncontribution is 1*(5e5 -5e5 +1) =1*1=1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the logic works for samples.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute T = C.\n\nInitialize total=0.\n\nLoop x from A to B:\n\n   y_low = max(max(x, B), T - x +1)\n\n   y_high = C.\n\n   if y_low > y_high:\n\n       continue.\n\n   else:\n\n       y0 = D -x +1\n\n       # determine case\n\n       if y0 < y_low:\n\n           cnt_y = y_high - y_low +1\n\n           term = cnt_y * (D - T +1)\n\n           total += term\n\n       elif y0 > y_high:\n\n           # case2: all group1\n\n           cnt = y_high - y_low +1\n\n           sum_xy = x * cnt + (y_low + y_high)*cnt //2\n\n           term = sum_xy - T * cnt\n\n           total += term\n\n       else:\n\n           # case3\n\n           group1_cnt = y0 - y_low +1\n\n           sum_g1 = (x - T)* group1_cnt + (y_low + y0) * group1_cnt // 2\n\n           group2_cnt = y_high - y0\n\n           term_g2 = (D - T +1) * group2_cnt\n\n           total += sum_g1 + term_g2\n\nFinally, print total.\n\nWait, but in the code, y0 can be computed as D - x + 1.\n\nYes.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- When x is very large, such that T - x +1 is negative.\n\nIn that case, y_low is max(x, B), which may be larger than T -x +1, but if T is C, and x is larger than T, then T -x +1 could be negative, but y_low would be at least max(x, B).\n\nWait, but for x > T, T -x +1 is negative, so y_low is max(x, B), which is at least x >= T.\n\nSo in such cases, y_low >=x >= T.\n\nBut then, since y_high is C, which may be >= T, but if x > C, then y_low is x, which may be larger than y_high.\n\nWait, but for x in [A, B], and since B <= C, x can't be larger than C only when B <= C.\n\nWait, no. For example, if B = C, then x can be up to C.\n\nBut if B < C, then x can be up to B, which is <= C.\n\nWait, no. Wait, B is the upper limit for x, and since B <= C.\n\nSo x can't be larger than B, which is <= C.\n\nSo in all cases, x is <= C.\n\nSo T is C.\n\nSo x can be up to B, which is <= C.\n\nSo T -x +1 is >= C - B +1, which is at least 1 if B < C.\n\nBut in cases where x is B, which is <= C.\n\nSo T -x +1 is >=1.\n\nWait, but when x is larger than T -x +1.\n\nFor example, when x=3, T=3: T-x+1=1.\n\nSo y_low is max(3, B, 1). If B is 2, then y_low is 3.\n\nSo that's handled correctly.\n\nAnother edge case: when D is less than C.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, C <= D, so D is at least C.\n\nSo D >= C, so for any x and y, x + y can be up to (B + C). Since B <= C, x can be up to B, y up to C. So x+y can be up to 2C.\n\nBut D can be as low as C, so z can be up to min(D, x+y-1) which can be as low as C.\n\nAnother edge case: when x + y <= C.\n\nFor example, x=1, y=2, C=3. Then x+y=3, which is equal to C. So condition x + y > C is false. So no contribution.\n\nSo code correctly skips such cases.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nWe can read the input as four integers.\n\nCompute T = C.\n\nThen loop x from A to B.\n\nFor each x, compute y_low, y_high.\n\nIf y_low > y_high: skip.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute y0 = D -x +1.\n\nThen handle the three cases.\n\nNow, in Python, for large loops (like 5e5 iterations), it's better to read all the input at once, but for simplicity, we can read line by line.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute T = C.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor x in range(A, B+1):\n\n    y_low = max( max(x, B), T - x + 1 )\n\n    y_high = C\n\n    if y_low > y_high:\n\n        continue\n\n    y0 = D - x + 1\n\n    if y0 < y_low:\n\n        cnt_y = y_high - y_low +1\n\n        term = cnt_y * ( D - T + 1 )\n\n        total += term\n\n    elif y0 > y_high:\n\n        cnt = y_high - y_low +1\n\n        sum_xy = x * cnt + (y_low + y_high) * cnt // 2\n\n        term = sum_xy - T * cnt\n\n        total += term\n\n    else:\n\n        group1_cnt = y0 - y_low +1\n\n        sum_g1 = (x - T) * group1_cnt + (y_low + y0) * group1_cnt //2\n\n        group2_cnt = y_high - y0\n\n        term_g2 = ( D - T + 1 ) * group2_cnt\n\n        total += sum_g1 + term_g2\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but when D - T +1 is negative, that would cause the term_g2 to be negative, which shouldn't happen because group2 is only considered when y0 <= y_high.\n\nWait, no: y0 is D -x +1. Since y0 is in [y_low, y_high], but what if D < T?\n\nNo, because T is C, and C <= D. So D >= C → D - T +1 >=1.\n\nBecause D >= C → D - C +1 >=1.\n\nSo D - T +1 is always >=1.\n\nSo no problem with negative terms.\n\nTesting with sample 1:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nT=3.\n\nx=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3-1+1=3) →3.\n\ny_high=3.\n\ny0=4-1+1=4.\n\ny0> y_high=3 → case2.\n\ncnt=3-3+1=1.\n\nsum_xy=1*1 + (3+3)*1//2=1 +3=4.\n\nterm=4-3*1=1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low= max(2, 3-2+1=2) →2.\n\ny_high=3.\n\ny0=4-2+1=3.\n\nso in case3.\n\ngroup1_cnt=3-2+1=2.\n\nsum_g1= (2-3)*2 + (2+3)*2//2 → (-1)*2 +5*1= (-2)+5=3.\n\ngroup2_cnt=3-3=0.\n\nterm_g2=0.\n\nso total +=3.\n\nSo total is 1+3=4.\n\nSample passes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSample 3: all 5e5.\n\nx=5e5.\n\ny_low= max(5e5,5e5, 5e5 -5e5 +1)=5e5.\n\ny_high=5e5.\n\ny0=5e5 -5e5 +1=1.\n\ny0 < y_low → case1.\n\ncnt_y=5e5 -5e5 +1=1.\n\nterm=1*(5e5 -5e5 +1) =1.\n\nSo total is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: when D is small.\n\nSuppose A=1, B=2, C=3, D=3.\n\nx=1:\n\ny_low= max(2, 3-1+1=3) →3.\n\ny_high=3.\n\ny0=3-1+1=3.\n\ncase3.\n\ngroup1_cnt=3-3+1=1.\n\nsum_g1= (1-3)*1 + (3+3)*1//2 → (-2) + 3=1.\n\ngroup2_cnt=0.\n\nterm_g2=0.\n\nso contribution is 1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low= max(2, 3-2+1=2) →2.\n\ny_high=3.\n\ny0=3-2+1=2.\n\ncase3.\n\ngroup1_cnt=2-2+1=1.\n\nsum_g1= (2-3)*1 + (2+2)*1//2 → (-1) +2=1.\n\ngroup2_cnt=3-2=1.\n\nterm_g2=(3-3+1)*1=1.\n\nso total +=1+1=2.\n\nTotal is 1+2=3.\n\nWhat does this represent?\n\nFor x=1, y=3, z can be from 3 to min(3,1+3-1)=3.\n\nSo z=3.\n\nSo (1,3,3) is valid.\n\nFor x=2, y=2: z can be from 3 to min(3, 2+2-1)=3 → z=3.\n\nBut 2+2>3 is 4>3, yes.\n\nSo (2,2,3) is valid.\n\nFor x=2, y=3: z can be from 3 to min(3, 2+3-1)=4. But D=3, so z=3.\n\nSo (2,3,3) is valid.\n\nSo total 3 triangles.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python.\n\nWe can read the input as a single line, split into four integers.\n\nHandle all cases, including when D < C, but according to the problem statement, C <= D, so that's not possible.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute T = C.\n\nInitialize total =0.\n\nLoop x from A to B.\n\nCompute y_low, y_high.\n\nIf y_low > y_high: skip.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute y0.\n\nCheck cases.\n\nAdd to total.\n\nPrint total.\n\nSo the code should look like this.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles that can be formed with integer sides \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\) such that \\( A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D \\). A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Given the constraints, the main condition we need to check is \\( x + y > z \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Constraints Analysis**: We need to find valid triplets \\( (x, y, z) \\) where \\( x \\) ranges from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\), \\( y \\) ranges from \\( B \\) to \\( C \\), and \\( z \\) ranges from \\( C \\) to \\( D \\). The key condition for a non-degenerate triangle is \\( x + y > z \\).\n\n2. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of iterating through all possible values of \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\) directly, which would be computationally expensive, we use mathematical insights to optimize the calculation:\n   - For each \\( x \\) in the range \\([A, B]\\), determine the valid range of \\( y \\) such that \\( y \\geq \\max(x, B) \\) and \\( y \\leq C \\).\n   - For each valid pair \\( (x, y) \\), compute the range of \\( z \\) values that satisfy \\( C \\leq z \\leq \\min(D, x + y - 1) \\).\n\n3. **Mathematical Insight**: By breaking down the problem into cases based on the value of \\( y_0 = D - x + 1 \\), we can efficiently count the valid \\( z \\) values without iterating through each possible \\( z \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_triangles():\n    import sys\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    T = C\n    total = 0\n    for x in range(A, B + 1):\n        y_low = max(max(x, B), T - x + 1)\n        y_high = C\n        if y_low > y_high:\n            continue\n        y0 = D - x + 1\n        if y0 < y_low:\n            cnt_y = y_high - y_low + 1\n            term = cnt_y * (D - T + 1)\n            total += term\n        elif y0 > y_high:\n            cnt = y_high - y_low + 1\n            sum_xy = x * cnt + (y_low + y_high) * cnt // 2\n            term = sum_xy - T * cnt\n            total += term\n        else:\n            group1_cnt = y0 - y_low + 1\n            sum_g1 = (x - T) * group1_cnt + (y_low + y0) * group1_cnt // 2\n            group2_cnt = y_high - y0\n            term_g2 = (D - T + 1) * group2_cnt\n            total += sum_g1 + term_g2\n    print(total)\n\ncount_triangles()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input values \\( A, B, C, D \\) are read and parsed.\n- **Loop through \\( x \\)**: For each \\( x \\) from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\), compute the valid range of \\( y \\) values.\n- **Determine Valid \\( y \\) Range**: Calculate \\( y_{\\text{low}} \\) and \\( y_{\\text{high}} \\) to ensure \\( y \\) is within bounds and satisfies the triangle condition.\n- **Calculate Valid \\( z \\) Range**: For each valid \\( (x, y) \\) pair, determine the range of \\( z \\) values that form a valid triangle and accumulate the count.\n\nThis approach efficiently reduces the problem complexity by leveraging mathematical insights and avoids brute-force iteration, making it suitable for large input sizes.",
