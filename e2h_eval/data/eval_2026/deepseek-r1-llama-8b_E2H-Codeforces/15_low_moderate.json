They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine all winning integers x in a tournament setup. The tournament is structured in a way similar to a single-elimination bracket, and the outcome of each game depends on the string s given.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the tournament has 2^n teams. They play 2^n - 1 games. The structure is such that in each phase i (from 1 to n), there are 2^{n-i} games. For example, the first phase has 2^{n-1} games, pairing the teams as 1v2, 3v4, etc. Each game eliminates one team, so after the first phase, half remain.\n\nThe second phase groups winners from the first phase into larger brackets. For instance, in phase 2, each group is the winner of two previous games. So, for phase 2, the winners from phase 1's pairs form new matches, like (winners of 1v2 vs 3v4), and so on.\n\nEach game's outcome is determined by the corresponding character in the string s. If s_i is '0', then in phase i, the lower-skilled team wins. If it's '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nThe task is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x is the champion. That is, x can be the winner of the entire tournament with some arrangement of the skills.\n\nHmm. So the question is about finding all possible x where x can be the overall winner given the rules for each phase.\n\nI think the approach here is to model the tournament as a binary tree. Each node represents a game, and leaves are the initial matches. But maybe a more efficient way is to represent the possible winners at each level based on the phase's rule.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the process recursively. For each phase, depending on whether it's a '0' or '1' phase, certain teams will advance based on their skill levels.\n\nLet me think about what determines if a particular team can be the champion.\n\nIn each phase, the teams are paired, and within each pair, the winner advances. The way they pair depends on the structure of the tournament, which is determined by the number of phases.\n\nBut the key is that the structure of the tournament is fixed regardless of the permutation p. Only the skill levels change.\n\nSo for each phase i, the teams are grouped into 2^{n-i} games. For example, in phase 1, the first 2^{n-1} games are between consecutive pairs, but wait no: the initial phase has 2^{n-1} games, pairing 1v2, 3v4, etc., so the next phase's participants are these winners.\n\nWait, the way the teams are grouped in each phase is important. Let's see:\n\nPhase 1: 2^{n-1} games, each between 2k+1 and 2k+2 for k from 0 to 2^{n-1}-1.\n\nPhase 2: 2^{n-2} games, each group is formed by taking the winners of the first two games in phase 1, then the next two, etc. So the grouping is blocks of size 2, each block consisting of two phase 1 winners.\n\nWait, no. Wait, phase 2 is formed by taking the 2^{n-1} winners from phase 1, and grouping them into 2^{n-2} games. Each game is the winner of two adjacent phase 1 games. Like, for example, the first game of phase 2 is the winner of game 1 (phase 1) against the winner of game 2 (phase 1). Then the third game of phase 1's winner plays against the fourth, and so on.\n\nSo the structure is that phase i has 2^{n -i} games, each of which combines 2^{i-1} phase i-1 winners.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: each phase i is a round where the number of games is 2^{n -i}, and the teams are grouped into those games based on how the previous phase's winners were arranged.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to model the tournament as a series of rounds, each determining which teams can reach the next round.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 18, the total number of teams is 2^18 = 262144, which is manageable only with efficient algorithms.\n\nWait, but even 2^18 is about 260k, which is manageable for some bitmask approaches, but perhaps not for brute-force methods.\n\nHmm. So the challenge is to model the process efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the process:\n\nWe can model the tournament as a series of rounds, each round being a phase. For each phase, the current set of teams",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all winning integers x in a tournament setup where each game's outcome is determined by a given string. The tournament structure is a single-elimination bracket, and the outcome of each game depends on whether the lower-skilled or higher-skilled team wins.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - The tournament has 2^n teams and consists of n phases.\n   - Each phase i determines the winners based on whether the lower-skilled (s[i] = '0') or higher-skilled (s[i] = '1') team wins.\n   - We need to find all possible integers x such that there exists a permutation of skills where x can be the champion.\n\n2. **Intuition**:\n   - The tournament can be viewed as a binary tree where each node represents a game, and leaves are the initial matches.\n   - Each phase groups winners from the previous phase into new matches, determining the next set of winners.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - Use a dynamic programming approach to track possible winners at each phase.\n   - Represent the state using a bitmask to efficiently track which teams can win at each level.\n\n4. **Complexity Consideration**:\n   - Given n can be up to 18, the solution must efficiently handle 2^18 teams.\n   - The bitmask approach ensures that we only track feasible winners at each step, keeping the complexity manageable.\n\n5. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - For each phase, update the possible winners based on the current phase's rule (either lower or higher skill wins).\n   - Track the possible winners using bitmasks, where each bit represents a team that can win at the current phase.\n   - After processing all phases, collect all possible winners.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Initialize the DP array\n    dp = [0] * (1 << n)\n    dp[1 << 0] = 1  # Initially, only the first team can be a winner\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        phase = n - i - 1  # 0-based for the current phase index\n        games = 1 << (n - i - 1)  # Number of games in this phase\n        mask = (1 << (games // 2)) - 1  # Mask for the current phase's group\n        \n        # For each possible group of 2^(phase) teams\n        for g in range(0, games, 2):\n            # Determine the current phase's rule\n            if s[i] == '0':\n                # Lower skill wins, so within each pair, the lower one advances\n                # So for each pair, the winner is the smaller one\n                # The group is two consecutive blocks of size 2^(phase-1)\n                # So the mask for the group is 0xAAAAAAAA... depending on the phase\n                # Wait, perhaps it's better to process each pair within the group\n                # Split the current group into pairs, each consisting of two elements\n                # For each pair, the lower one wins\n                # So the new_mask is constructed by taking min of each pair\n                # But how to split into pairs?\n                \n                # The current group has 2^(phase) teams, so number of pairs is 2^(phase-1)\n                # Each pair is two consecutive teams\n                # So for the current group, the masks are processed as follows:\n                new_dp = 0\n                for j in range(0, games // 2):\n                    left = (g + j) << (phase)\n                    right = (g + j + 1) << (phase)\n                    # Take the minimum of the two\n                    new_dp |= ((min(left, right)) >> (phase))\n                dp[new_dp] |= mask\n            else:\n                # Higher skill wins, so within each pair, the higher one advances\n                new_dp = 0\n                for j in range(0, games // 2):\n                    left = (g + j) << (phase)\n                    right = (g + j + 1) << (phase)\n                    # Take the maximum of the two\n                    new_dp |= ((max(left, right)) >> (phase))\n                dp[new_dp] |= mask\n        \n    # After processing all phases, collect all possible winners\n    result = []\n    for x in range(1, 1 << n):\n        if dp[x]:\n            result.append(x)\n    \n    # Group the results by their binary representations\n    grouped = {}\n    for x in result:\n        key = bin(x)[2:].count('1')\n        if key not in grouped:\n            grouped[key] = []\n        grouped[key].append(x)\n    \n    # Sort each group and prepare the output\n    output = []\n    for key in sorted(grouped.keys()):\n        group = sorted(grouped[key])\n        output_line = ' '.join(map(str, group))\n        output.append(output_line)\n    \n    # Print the results\n    for line in output:\n        print(line)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: Start with the first team as the only possible winner.\n- **Phase Processing**: For each phase, update the possible winners based on whether lower-skilled or higher-skilled teams win. This is done by adjusting the bitmask to reflect the winners at each level.\n- **Result Collection**: After processing all phases, collect all possible winners and group them by their binary representation to form the final result.\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks the possible winners at each phase using bitmasks, ensuring that the solution handles the constraints effectively.",
