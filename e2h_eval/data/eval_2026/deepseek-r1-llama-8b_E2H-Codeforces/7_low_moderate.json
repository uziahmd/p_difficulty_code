The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine for a given number n whether it's possible to construct a snowflake graph as defined. The snowflake is built in a certain way, and I have to figure out for each test case if such a snowflake exists with exactly n vertices.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nThe snowflake is constructed as follows:\n\n- Start with one vertex.\n- Then, connect this initial vertex to k new vertices, where k > 1.\n- For every vertex that has only one edge (so degree 1), add k new vertices connected to it. This step must be done at least once.\n\nSo the process is: create a root, then in the first step, add k children. Then, each of those children (since they now have degree 1) must each add their own k children. But this step can be done multiple times. Or wait, no—the step is to do it at least once. So after the initial step, we have to perform this expansion step at least once.\n\nWait, the problem says \"each vertex that is connected by edges to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\" So after the initial step, each leaf must undergo this expansion step at least once.\n\nSo the structure is a rooted tree where each node has either 0 or k children. Wait, but the initial root has k children. Then each of those has k children, because when you expand them, they add k new nodes. So it's a perfect k-ary tree, but with a certain depth.\n\nBut let's think about how many nodes there are for different structures.\n\nThe initial step is level 0: 1 node.\n\nLevel 1: k nodes.\n\nEach of those must be expanded, which adds level 2: k * k nodes.\n\nAnd this process continues for m steps, where m is the number of times we perform the expansion. Wait, but the expansion step is required to be done at least once, so m >=1.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me clarify.\n\nThe process is:\n\n1. Start with 1 node.\n\n2. Add k children to it. So now total nodes are 1 +k.\n\n3. Then, for each of the k nodes (they are leaves), add k children each. So each adds k, so total added is k*k. Now total is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the step where each leaf adds k children must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake is when the initial step is done, and then this expansion step is done once.\n\nWait, the example in the problem shows that for k=4, the smallest possible snowflake has 1 +4 +16 =21 nodes? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example. Because according to the input example, for n=9, the output is NO. Wait, let's look at the sample input and output.\n\nSample Input:\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\nSample Output:\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nSo for n=6, the output is YES. Let's see why.\n\nWhat possible k can lead to n=6?\n\nWait, the snowflake must have at least two layers beyond the initial root.\n\nBecause the expansion step must be done at least once.\n\nSo the minimal structure is:\n\nRoot (1) -> k children (level 1) -> each of those has k children (level 2).\n\nSo the total nodes are 1 +k +k^2.\n\nFor n=6: 1 +k +k^2 =6. Solving for k:\n\nk^2 +k +1 =6 → k^2 +k -5=0. Discriminant sqrt(1+20)=sqrt(21)≈4.58. So k=( -1 +4.58)/2≈1.79. Not an integer. So no solution for k>1.\n\nWait, that's confusing because the sample output says for n=6, output is YES. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion step can be performed a variable number of times. Like, after adding the first layer, each leaf can be expanded any number of times, including zero? No, the problem says the step must be done at least once. So each leaf must have been expanded at least once.\n\nWait, perhaps the snowflake can have multiple levels beyond the second. Like, the root has k children, each of which has k children, each of those has k children, etc., for some number of layers.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m is the number of layers beyond the root",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by the problem. The snowflake graph is constructed in a specific hierarchical manner, and we need to check if \\( n \\) can be the total number of vertices in such a structure.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph starts with a single root node. It then expands by adding \\( k \\) children to the root, where \\( k > 1 \\). Each subsequent layer adds \\( k \\) children to every leaf node from the previous layer. This expansion must occur at least once beyond the root's immediate children.\n\n2. **Formulating the Problem**: The total number of vertices in a snowflake graph can be represented as a sum of a geometric series. Specifically, for a structure with \\( m \\) layers (including the root), the total number of vertices \\( n \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^m\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( m \\) is the number of layers beyond the root, and each layer \\( i \\) contributes \\( k^i \\) nodes.\n\n3. **Finding Valid \\( k \\)**: For a given \\( n \\), we need to check if there exists an integer \\( k > 1 \\) such that \\( n \\) can be expressed as the sum of the series for some \\( m \\geq 1 \\) (since the expansion must occur at least once).\n\n4. **Iterative Check**: Iterate over possible values of \\( m \\) starting from 1 upwards. For each \\( m \\), compute the potential \\( k \\) using the quadratic formula derived from the sum of the geometric series. Check if \\( k \\) is an integer greater than 1.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False  # Because k>1 and initial step is required\n    # We need to find m >=1 and k>1 such that n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m\n    # Let's try different possible m values\n    max_m = int(math.log2(n)) + 2  # Since 1 +k +k^2 can't exceed n\n    for m in range(1, max_m):\n        # The sum is (k^(m+1) -1)/(k-1)\n        # So 1 +k + ... +k^m = S = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n        # We have S = n\n        # Rearranged: (k^(m+1) -1) = n*(k-1)\n        # k^(m+1) -1 = n*k -n\n        # k^(m+1) -n*k + (n-1) =0\n        # Let's treat this as a polynomial equation in k: k^(m+1) -n*k + (n-1) =0\n        # We can try to find roots for small m\n        # For each m, approximate k using binary search\n        low = 2\n        high = n\n        found = False\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            val = mid ** (m+1) - n * mid + (n -1)\n            if val ==0:\n                found = True\n                break\n            elif val <0:\n                low = mid +1\n            else:\n                high = mid -1\n        if found:\n            return True\n        # Alternatively, use binary search to find if any k exists\n    return False\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    if n < 3:  # Minimum is 1 +k where k>=2, so minimum n=3?\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    # Check if n can be written as 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m for some m>=1 and k>1\n    # Try all possible m up to log2(n) since k^m grows exponentially\n    max_m = int(math.log2(n)) +2\n    for m in range(1, max_m):\n        # The sum is S = (k^(m+1) -1)/(k-1) = n\n        # So k^(m+1) -1 = n*(k-1)\n        # Let's try to find k via binary search for each m\n        low =2\n        high = n\n        found = False\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            s = mid**(m+1) -1\n            if s < n*(mid -1):\n                # Need larger s, so mid is too small\n                low = mid +1\n            elif s > n*(mid -1):\n                high = mid -1\n            else:\n                # Check if s ==n*(mid-1)\n                if s == n*(mid-1):\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                else:\n                    # Maybe mid is not exact, but close enough\n                    # Try to adjust\n                    if s < n*(mid -1):\n                        low = mid +1\n                    else:\n                        high = mid -1\n        if found:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            break\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution iterates over possible values of \\( m \\) (number of layers beyond the root) and uses binary search to determine if a valid \\( k \\) exists for each \\( m \\).
