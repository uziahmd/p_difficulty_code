Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Hmm, let's see. The problem says that two boots are compatible if their colors are the same or if one is a question mark. Oh right, because '?' is compatible with any color.\n\nSo the input gives me two strings, l and r, each of length n. Each character in l represents a left boot, and in r a right boot. I need to pair them such that each left is paired with exactly one right, and vice versa, without overlapping. And I have to maximize the number of pairs.\n\nFirst, I think I should count how many of each color there are in both left and right boots, including the question marks. Because for each possible color (including ?), I can figure out how many lefts and rights I can pair.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem allows each boot to be part of at most one pair. So it's not just about matching counts, but also ensuring that after pairing some, the remaining can form other pairs.\n\nHmm, this might complicate things. Because for example, if I have 3 left 'a's and 2 right 'a's, I can only pair 2 of them. Then, the remaining left 'a' can't be paired again unless there are other right 'a's or '?'s.\n\nBut maybe a greedy approach could work here. Like, for each color, pair as many as possible between left and right, then move on to the next color.\n\nWait, but that might not be optimal because sometimes combining different colors could lead to more pairs. For instance, if I have left: [a, b] and right: [c, d], pairing a with c and b with d gives two pairs. But if I pair a with d and b with c, that's still two pairs. So maybe the order doesn't matter much. Or perhaps not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal solution is to match each left and right of the same color, and then handle the question marks appropriately.\n\nWait, let's think about this:\n\nEach left and right can be considered as a node in a bipartite graph, and edges exist between compatible pairs. We need to find a maximum matching in this graph. But with n up to 150,000, standard algorithms like Hopcroft-Karp won't work due to time constraints.\n\nSo we need an efficient way to compute this without building such a graph.\n\nHmm, another idea: group all left and right by their color (including '?'), then for each group, the maximum possible pairs is the minimum of the left count and right count for that color. But then, also account for the question marks which can pair with anything.\n\nWait, no. Because question marks can pair with any color, including other question marks. So perhaps the way to model this is:\n\n1. First, process the exact colors. For each color c, take the minimum of the count of left c's and right c's. Sum all these minima across c to get a base number of pairs.\n\n2. Then, process the question marks. Each left '?' can pair with any right, including other '?'. Similarly, each right '?' can pair with any left.\n\nBut wait, after handling the exact colors, how do we handle the question marks? Because each left and right can be used once.\n\nHmm, maybe the question marks can form additional pairs beyond what's already been counted in step 1.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I have m_left question marks in the left, and m_right question marks in the right. Each left '?' can be paired with any right, including other '?', but the total number of pairs from question marks would be the minimum of m_left and m_right plus something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs from question marks is the sum of the minimum of left and right counts for each exact color plus the number of question mark pairs possible.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to model this.\n\nLet me create two dictionaries: left_counts and right_counts.\n\nleft_counts[c] is the number of left boots of color c (including '?').\n\nright_counts[c] is the number of right boots of color c (including '?').\n\nThen, for each exact color c (excluding '?'), the possible pairs are min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]). Summing these gives the base.\n\nBut then, the question marks can be used as follows:\n\nEach left '?' can pair with any right (including '?'). So the maximum number of pairs contributed by left '?' is equal to the number of right '?' plus the number of right specific colors.\n\nWait, no. Because each left '?' can be matched to any right, regardless of color. Similarly, each right '?' can be matched to any left.\n\nSo the total possible question mark pairs is the minimum of the total left '?' and total right '?' plus the number of non-? pairs that involve one side being",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots such that each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot with compatible colors. The colors can be specific or indefinite (denoted by '?'), where a specific color is compatible only with itself, and an indefinite color is compatible with any other color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Colors**: First, count the occurrences of each color in both the left and right boot strings. This includes treating '?' as a special color.\n2. **Exact Color Matching**: For each specific color (excluding '?'), compute the maximum possible pairs by taking the minimum of the counts from the left and right boots.\n3. **Question Mark Handling**: After handling exact colors, use the remaining question marks to form additional pairs. Each left '?' can pair with any right boot, including other '?', and vice versa.\n4. **Maximize Pairs**: Calculate the total number of pairs by summing the exact matches and the question mark pairs, ensuring no overlaps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    l = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    left_counts = defaultdict(int)\n    right_counts = defaultdict(int)\n    \n    for c in l:\n        if c == '?':\n            left_counts['?'] += 1\n        else:\n            left_counts[c] += 1\n    \n    for c in r:\n        if c == '?':\n            right_counts['?'] += 1\n        else:\n            right_counts[c] += 1\n    \n    # Process exact colors\n    exact_pairs = 0\n    processed_left = defaultdict(int)\n    processed_right = defaultdict(int)\n    for key in left_counts:\n        if key != '?':\n            processed_left[key] = left_counts[key]\n        if key in right_counts and key != '?':\n            processed_right[key] = right_counts[key]\n    \n    for c in processed_left:\n        if c in processed_right:\n            min_count = min(processed_left[c], processed_right[c])\n            exact_pairs += min_count\n            processed_left[c] -= min_count\n            processed_right[c] -= min_count\n    \n    # Now process question marks\n    q_left = left_counts.get('?', 0)\n    q_right = right_counts.get('?', 0)\n    \n    # The number of pairs that can be formed using ?

It then calculates the maximum number of pairs by considering exact color matches and question marks separately. The exact color pairs are determined by the minimum counts of each color from both sides. Question marks are handled by pairing them with any remaining boots after exact matches, maximizing the number of pairs formed. The approach ensures that we maximize the number of compatible pairs efficiently.",
