The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++.

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Xenia is trying to complete her tasks by moving along a ringroad. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem statement says that Xenia lives in a city with n houses arranged in a ring. The traffic is one-way and clockwise. She starts at house 1 and has m tasks. For each task i, she needs to be at house a_i. But not just that—she also has to complete all tasks with numbers less than i. So for the first task (i=1), she must be at a_1, then for the second task, she must be at a_2 after the first is done, and so on.\n\nWait, wait. Oh right, no—the description says she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me read that again.\n\nNo, it says: \"to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\" Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Or perhaps, the way it's phrased, she has to process the tasks in order. So for each i from 1 to m, she must be present at a_i before handling the next task. But the initial position is house 1.\n\nSo the sequence is: start at 1, then go to a_1 for the first task, then from there to a_2 for the second, etc., but since the ring is circular, the distance can be computed as the minimal steps between two points on a circle.\n\nBut wait, no. Because she might have to do multiple tasks at the same house. Like, if the a_i's are [3,2,3], then she needs to go 1 → 2 →3 →4 →1 →2 →3. So how does that work? Because she's doing task 1 at 3, then task 2 at 2, then task 3 at 3 again.\n\nWait, but the problem says that for each task i, she needs to be at a_i and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. So perhaps the processing order is such that she must visit a_i in the order of their indices, but each time she arrives at a_i, she handles all tasks j ≤ i that are equal to a_i. Or maybe not—perhaps each task i is processed exactly once, and she has to be present at a_i when she processes it.\n\nI think the key is that the tasks are processed in order, and each task i requires her to be at a_i at some point before processing any task j > i.\n\nWait, no. The problem says, \"In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\" Hmm, maybe that wording is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it means that for each task i, she must be at a_i at some point before she completes all tasks with j < i.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model this as she has to visit each a_i in the order of increasing i, but not necessarily consecutively. So she starts at 1, then for each task in order from 1 to m, she moves to a_i, and the total time is the sum of the distances between consecutive positions, considering the ring structure.\n\nBut wait, the example given in the problem clarifies this. In the first test case, the input is 4 3 and the a's are 3,2,3. The output is 6.\n\nThe sequence is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's see:\n\nStarts at 1. Then goes to 2 (distance 1). Then to 3 (distance 1). Then to 4 (distance 1). Then back to 1 (distance 1). Then to 2 (distance 1). Then to 3 (distance 1). Total steps: 6.\n\nSo the path is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3.\n\nNow, looking at the a_i's in order: 3,2,3.\n\nSo the first task is to go to 3. The second to 2. The third to 3.\n\nSo the movement is from 1 to 2, then 2 to 3, then 3 to 4, then 4 to 1, then 1 to 2, then 2 to 3.\n\nWait, but why does she go to 4 in between? Because she has to reach a_1=3, which is after 2. So perhaps the way to model this is that the tasks are processed in order, and for each task, she has to move from her current position to a_i, but the movement for each task adds the necessary steps.\n\nSo the total time is the sum of the distances from her starting point (which is initially 1) to each a_i, but considering the circular arrangement.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nShe starts at 1.\n\nFor task 1 (a=3): she goes 1 → 2 →3: 2 steps.\n\nFor task 2 (a=2): she goes 3 →4 →1 →2: 3 steps.\n\nFor task 3 (a=3): she goes 2 →3: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nWait, but that's a different approach. So the idea is that for each task, she moves from her current position to a_i, and the number of steps is the minimal distance between those two points on the ring.\n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating the sum of the minimal distances between consecutive positions, where the consecutive positions are the initial position (1) followed by each a_i in order.\n\nWait, that makes sense because each time she has to reach a_i, regardless of where she was before. So the minimal steps between her current location and a_i is added to the total time.\n\nSo the solution is:\n\n- Sort the list of a_i's in the order they are given.\n\n- Compute the minimal distance between each pair of consecutive positions, including from 1 to a_1.\n\nThen sum all these distances to get the total time.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the steps to compute the answer are:\n\n1. Start with the initial position pos = 1.\n\n2. For each task in the list a[0..m-1]:\n\n   a. Compute the minimal distance from pos to a[i].\n\n   b. Add this distance to the total time.\n\n   c. Update pos to a[i].\n\nSo the main thing is to correctly calculate the minimal distance between two points on a ring.\n\nHow to compute the minimal distance between x and y on a ring of n houses?\n\nSince the ring is circular, the distance can be computed as min( (y - x) % n, (x - y) % n ), but wait, that gives the absolute difference, but we have to consider the ring.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal distance is the minimum of (y - x) mod n and (x - y) mod n, but more accurately, the distance is the minimal of the clockwise and counter-clockwise paths.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is:\n\nThe distance from x to y is the minimal steps needed, which is the minimum of (y - x) mod n and (x - y) mod n, but since mod n can give us negative values, perhaps it's easier to compute as follows:\n\nCompute the difference d = (y - x) % n.\n\nIf d == 0, the distance is 0.\n\nElse, the distance is min(d, n - d).\n\nWait, yes. Because for example, if n=4, x=1, y=3: (3-1)=2 mod 4 is 2. The distance is min(2, 4-2)=2.\n\nAnother example: x=3, y=4. (4-3) mod4=1. Distance is 1.\n\nAnother example: x=4, y=1. (1-4) mod4 is -3 mod4=1. So distance is min(1, 4-1)=1.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me re-examine this.\n\nWait, if x is 4 and y is 1, the distance is 1 step (clockwise direction) because the ring is circular.\n\nBut (y -x) is 1 -4 = -3. Mod n (4) is 1. So the clockwise distance is 1.\n\nBut the counter-clockwise distance would be 4-1=3 steps (from 4 to 3, 2, 1). So the minimal is 1 step.\n\nSo yes, using d = (y - x) mod n, and the minimal distance is min(d, n -d).\n\nWait, but when d is 0, both options are zero, which is correct.\n\nSo the formula is:\n\ndistance = min( (y -x) % n, (x - y) % n )\n\nWait, no. Because (x - y) modn is the same as (n - (y-x) modn ) modn. So the minimal distance is min( (y -x) %n, n - (y -x) %n ).\n\nSo perhaps it's better to compute d = (y -x) %n, and then the minimal distance is min(d, n -d).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the algorithm is:\n\n- Read n and m.\n\n- Read the list a of m integers.\n\n- Initialize current_position = 1.\n\n- total_time = 0.\n\n- For each ai in a:\n\n   - Compute the distance from current_position to ai.\n\n   - Add this distance to total_time.\n\n   - Set current_position = ai.\n\n- Output total_time.\n\nSo, let's test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput: 4 3\n\na = [3,2,3]\n\nProcess:\n\ncurrent = 1.\n\nai=3: distance from 1 to 3: (3-1) mod4=2, min(2,4-2)=2. total=2. current becomes 3.\n\nai=2: distance from 3 to 2: (2-3) mod4= -1 mod4=3. min(3,1)=1. total=3. current is 2.\n\nai=3: distance from 2 to3: (3-2)=1 mod4=1. min(1,3) is 1. total=4. current is3.\n\nWait wait, that's adding 2+1+1=4, but the expected output is 6. Hmm, something's wrong here.\n\nWait no, wait the example in the problem says the output is 6. So according to my calculation, it's adding up to 4, which is not correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I model the problem.\n\nWait, what's the issue here?\n\nWait, in the first example, the sample input is:\n\n['4 3\\n3 2 3'].\n\nWhich is n=4, m=3, a=[3,2,3].\n\nThe correct sequence is 1 →2 →3 →4 →1 →2 →3. So the steps are 1→2 (1), 2→3 (1), 3→4 (1), 4→1 (1), 1→2 (1), 2→3 (1). Total steps 6.\n\nBut according to the algorithm I proposed, the sum is 2+1+1=4.\n\nHmm, so where is the discrepancy?\n\nAh! Because in the algorithm, I only add the distance between consecutive a_i's, but in reality, she has to process each a_i in the given order, and for each a_i, she has to move from her current position to a_i, but the initial position is 1, and then each a_i in order.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the first step, she starts at 1, then goes to a_1=3. That's 2 steps.\n\nThen from 3, she goes to a_2=2. Which is 1 step.\n\nThen from 2, she goes to a_3=3, which is 1 step.\n\nTotal 2+1+1=4. But the actual steps are 6.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. So perhaps the initial model is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial model misses some steps because the a_i's are not necessarily in the order of increasing or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to arrange the a_i's in the order of their occurrence and compute the sum of the distances between each pair in that order.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the a_i's are 3,2,3.\n\nSo the path is 1 →3 (distance 2), 3→2 (distance 1), 2→3 (distance 1). Sum 4.\n\nBut the actual steps are 6. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nBecause in the sample, the movement includes going from 3 to4, then back to1, then 1→2, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial model is incorrect. Maybe the algorithm is missing the fact that she needs to process each task in order, but the movement is determined by all the tasks, not just the a_i's in order.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial model isn't sufficient because the a_i's may require visiting other houses in between.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to process all the a_i's in the order they appear and compute the minimal path that covers all a_i's in order, possibly revisiting some houses.\n\nSo, for each i from 1 to m, the current position is updated to a_i, and the distance is added.\n\nSo in the first example:\n\n1 →3 (distance 2).\n\n3 →2 (distance 1).\n\n2 →3 (distance 1).\n\nTotal 4.\n\nBut the sample shows a longer path. So why is that?\n\nAh, because in the sample, she has to process the tasks in order, but the a_i's are 3,2,3.\n\nWait, no, the problem statement says that she has to be at a_i and complete all tasks with j < i. So perhaps she doesn't have to process them in the order of the list, but instead in the order of their indices.\n\nWait, perhaps the i refers to the task index, not the value of a_i.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\"\n\nSo for the i-th task, she has to be at a_i and handle all tasks j <i.\n\nWait, that suggests that the order in which she handles the tasks is based on their indices, not their a_i's. So she processes task 1 first, then task 2, etc., regardless of where a_i is.\n\nSo the movement is from the current position to a_1, then to a_2, and so on.\n\nSo for the first example, the a's are [3,2,3].\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nTask 1: move to 3. Steps: 1→2→3: 2 steps.\n\nTask 2: move to 2. Steps: 3→4→1→2: 3 steps.\n\nTask 3: move to 3. Steps: 2→3: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 2+3+1=6.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo now the initial model is incorrect because it treats the a's as a list and processes them in order, but the correct model is to process them in the order of their indices.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For each i from 1 to m:\n\n   a. move from current position to a_i.\n\n   b. add the minimal distance to the total.\n\nSo, the list a is processed in the order of the indices, not sorted or anything.\n\nSo, the algorithm should be:\n\nInitialize current = 1.\n\ntotal = 0.\n\nfor each ai in a (in the order given):\n\n   compute the minimal distance from current to ai.\n\n   add to total.\n\n   current = ai.\n\nSo, the code will be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list a as integers.\n\ncurrent = 1.\n\ntotal = 0.\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    d = minimal_distance(current, num)\n\n    total +=d\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nNow, the question is: how to compute the minimal distance between two points on a ring.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the minimal distance is min( (num - current) % n, (current - num) %n ). Or perhaps, compute (num - current) mod n, then the minimal is the minimum between that and n minus that.\n\nWait, no. Because (num - current) can be negative.\n\nSo, for example, current is 3, num is 2, n=4.\n\n(num - current) = -1. Mod 4 is 3. So the minimal distance is min(3, 1). Wait, wait, wait.\n\nWait, 3 and 2 on a ring of 4: the clockwise distance is 3 steps (3→4→1→2), but the counter-clockwise is 1 step (3→2). So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo, (num - current) mod n is (2-3) mod4 = (-1) mod4 = 3. So the minimal distance is min(3, 4-3) =1.\n\nSo the correct way is to compute d = (num - current) %n.\n\nif d ==0: distance is 0.\n\nelse, distance is min(d, n -d).\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code for minimal distance is:\n\ndef minimal_distance(x, y, n):\n\n    d = (y - x) %n\n\n    return min(d, n -d)\n\nBut wait, let's test this function.\n\nTest case 1: x=1, y=3, n=4.\n\nd=(3-1) mod4=2.\n\nmin(2, 2) is 2. Correct.\n\nTest case 2: x=3, y=2, n=4.\n\nd= (2-3) mod4= -1 mod4=3.\n\nmin(3,1)=1. Correct.\n\nTest case 3: x=4, y=1, n=4.\n\nd=(1-4) mod4= -3 mod4=1.\n\nmin(1,3)=1. Correct.\n\nTest case 4: x=2, y=4, n=5.\n\nd=(4-2) mod5=2.\n\nmin(2,3) is 2.\n\nWhich is correct, because the clockwise distance is 2, counter is 3.\n\nSo the function works.\n\nSo now, let's re-calculate the first example.\n\na = [3,2,3]\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nProcessing each ai in order:\n\nFirst ai=3: distance from 1 to 3 is 2 steps.\n\ncurrent is now 3.\n\nSecond ai=2: distance from 3 to 2 is 1 step.\n\ncurrent is now 2.\n\nThird ai=3: distance from 2 to3 is 1 step.\n\nTotal 2+1+1=4. But the sample expects 6.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So why is the sample expecting 6?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the sample says that the correct sequence is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3, which is 6 steps.\n\nBut according to the algorithm, the movement is from 1 to 3 (steps 2), then 3 to 2 (step 1), then 2 to 3 (step 1). Total 4 steps. So the algorithm is not matching the sample.\n\nSo, clearly, my understanding is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the tasks are processed in the order of their indices, but the movement is from the previous position to the current a_i, but the a_i's may not be in order, leading to more steps.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the a_i's are 3,2,3.\n\nSo according to the algorithm, the movement is:\n\n1 →3: 2 steps.\n\n3 →2: 1 step.\n\n2 →3: 1 step.\n\nTotal 4.\n\nBut the sample shows a longer path, implying that the algorithm is not capturing all the required steps.\n\nSo perhaps the algorithm is missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial position is 1, and the first task is to go to a_1=3. Then, the second task is to go to a_2=2, which requires moving from 3 to 2 via 4 and 1, which is 3 steps (3→4, 4→1, 1→2). So that's 3 steps. Then the third task is to go to a_3=3, which is 1 step.\n\nSo the total is 2+3+1=6 steps.\n\nAh! So the algorithm is incorrect because it's computing the minimal distance between consecutive a_i's, but in reality, the a_i's may not be in order, leading to longer paths.\n\nWait, no. Because the movement is from the current position to a_i, which is the minimal possible steps. So why in the sample is the movement longer?\n\nBecause the a_i's are not in the order of their indices, but in this case, the a_i's are 3,2,3. So the second a_i is 2, which is before 3 in the ring. So the minimal path from 3 to 2 is indeed 1 step (counter-clockwise), but the sample's movement shows that she went the other way around.\n\nWait, but that would imply that the minimal path is being avoided. So why would the sample take the longer path?\n\nThis suggests that my initial understanding is wrong. Perhaps the problem requires that she must process the tasks in the order of their indices, but the movement is not allowed to skip certain steps, or perhaps the ring is considered as a directed ring, where you can only move in the clockwise direction.\n\nWait, the problem says that the traffic is one-way and clockwise. So she can only move in the clockwise direction.\n\nOh! Oh right, that's an important detail I missed. The ring is one-way, and you can only move clockwise. So the movement is always in the clockwise direction, and the minimal distance is the number of steps you have to take in the clockwise direction.\n\nSo, that changes everything.\n\nSo the movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction, meaning that from any house x, you can only move to x+1, x+2, etc., modulo n.\n\nSo, the minimal distance is not the minimal of the two directions, but the minimal steps in the clockwise direction.\n\nWait, no. Because the ring is one-way. So to go from x to y, you have to move in the clockwise direction, so the distance is (y -x) mod n steps.\n\nWait, because if you can only move clockwise, then the distance from x to y is the number of steps in the clockwise direction, which is (y -x) mod n.\n\nBecause, for example, if x=4, y=1, n=4, you can't move counter-clockwise. You have to go 4→1, which is 1 step. But (1-4) mod4 is -3 mod4=1. So yes, the distance is 1.\n\nAnother example: x=3, y=2, n=4. Since you can't move counter-clockwise, you have to go 3→4→1→2, which is 3 steps. (2-3) mod4= -1 mod4=3.\n\nSo the minimal distance in the clockwise direction is (y -x) mod n.\n\nThus, the algorithm must compute the distance as (y -x) mod n.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each a_i, compute the distance as (a_i - current) mod n, and add to the total. Then set current to a_i.\n\nSo in the first sample, let's recalculate.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=4, m=3.\n\na = [3,2,3].\n\nProcess:\n\ncurrent =1.\n\nFor a_1=3:\n\ndistance is (3-1) mod4=2. total=2. current=3.\n\nFor a_2=2:\n\ndistance is (2-3) mod4= ( -1 ) mod4=3. So 3 steps. total=5. current=2.\n\nFor a_3=3:\n\ndistance is (3-2) mod4=1. total=6. current=3.\n\nSo total is 2+3+1=6, which matches the sample.\n\nAh! So the initial model was incorrect because I thought the movement could be in either direction, but in reality, the movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction. So the minimal distance is always (y -x) mod n.\n\nSo the correct algorithm is:\n\nFor each task in the order given:\n\ndistance = (a_i - current) mod n.\n\nadd to total.\n\nset current to a_i.\n\nSo, the code is:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list a.\n\ncurrent =1.\n\ntotal=0.\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    d = (num - current) %n\n\n    total +=d\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, let's test this with the sample.\n\nSample 1:\n\na = [3,2,3].\n\nn=4.\n\ncurrent=1.\n\nd=3-1=2 mod4=2. total=2.\n\ncurrent=3.\n\nd=2-3= -1 mod4=3. total=5.\n\ncurrent=2.\n\nd=3-2=1 mod4=1. total=6.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nInput: 4 3\n\n2 3 3.\n\na = [2,3,3].\n\nn=4.\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent=1.\n\na_1=2: (2-1)=1 mod4=1. total=1. current=2.\n\na_2=3: (3-2)=1 mod4=1. total=2. current=3.\n\na_3=3: (3-3)=0. total remains 2.\n\nSo output is 2.\n\nWhich matches the second sample.\n\nGreat! So the correct algorithm is to compute the distance in the clockwise direction, which is (y -x) modn.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nWe can write a Python script that reads n and m, then the list of a's.\n\nThen, process each a_i in order, computing (a_i - current) modn, adding to the total, and updating current.\n\nSo the code would look like this:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent = 1\ntotal = 0\nfor num in a:\n    d = (num - current) % n\n    total += d\n    current = num\nprint(total)\n\nTesting this with the first sample:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\nd for 3: (3-1)=2 mod4=2. total=2.\n\nd for 2: (2-3)=-1 mod4=3. total=5.\n\nd for 3: 3-2=1 mod4=1. total=6.\n\nPrinted as 6.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [2,3,3].\n\nd for 2: 2-1=1 mod4=1. total=1.\n\nd for 3: 3-2=1. total=2.\n\nd for3:0. total 2.\n\nSo output is 2.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother test case: when a is all 1's.\n\nn=5, m=3, a = [1,1,1].\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent=1.\n\neach a_i is 1.\n\nd=0 each time.\n\ntotal=0.\n\nSo output 0.\n\nAnother test case: a = [4,1,4], n=4.\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent=1.\n\nd=4-1=3 mod4=3. total=3.\n\ncurrent=4.\n\nd=1-4= -3 mod4=1. total=4.\n\ncurrent=1.\n\nd=4-1=3. total=7.\n\nSo total is 3+1+3=7.\n\nWhich is correct because:\n\n1→4 (3 steps), 4→1 (1 step), 1→4 (3 steps). Total 7.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks if she can only move clockwise along a ring of houses. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and she must process each task in the given order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to move clockwise around a ring of `n` houses. She has `m` tasks, each specifying a house number where she must be present. The movement is restricted to clockwise direction only, meaning she can only move to the next house in the clockwise direction.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each task, the minimal distance from her current position to the required house is calculated using the clockwise direction. This distance is computed as `(destination - current) % n`, where `n` is the total number of houses.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Initialize her current position at house 1.\n   - For each task in the given order, compute the clockwise distance from her current position to the destination house.\n   - Sum these distances to get the total time required to complete all tasks.\n\n4. **Complexity**: The solution efficiently processes each task exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(m), which is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent = 1\ntotal = 0\nfor num in a:\n    d = (num - current) % n\n    total += d\n    current = num\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`, followed by the list of house numbers where each task must be completed.\n- **Initialization**: Xenia starts at house 1.\n- **Processing Tasks**: For each task, the code calculates the clockwise distance from the current house to the destination house using modulo arithmetic. This distance is added to the total time.\n- **Update Position**: After completing each task, Xenia updates her current position to the destination house.\n- **Output**: Finally, the total time taken to complete all tasks is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that Xenia moves optimally in the clockwise direction, minimizing the total time required to complete all her tasks.",
