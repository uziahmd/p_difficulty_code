    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on the sides. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem states that Yuri has favorite numbers A, B, C, D where A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. We need to find the number of triangles with integer sides x, y, z such that:\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B\nB ≤ y ≤ C\nC ≤ z ≤ D\n\nAnd also, these sides must satisfy the triangle inequality for a non-degenerate triangle. That means, x + y > z, because in a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. Since z is the largest here, we just need to check if x + y > z.\n\nWait, but wait: in our case, since x ≤ y ≤ z, because x is between A and B, y is between B and C (so at least B), and z is at least C, which is ≥ y. So z is definitely the largest side. So the triangle condition reduces to x + y > z.\n\nSo the approach is to count all triplets (x, y, z) such that:\n\nx is in [A, B]\ny is in [B, C]\nz is in [C, D]\nand x + y > z.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the ranges. The variables are within specific intervals, and the constraints are on x, y, z. So perhaps we can precompute some ranges and then iterate over possible values.\n\nHmm, but considering that A, B, C, D can be up to 5e5, iterating directly would be too slow. We need an O(1) or O(n^2) approach that's manageable.\n\nWait, let's consider the possible ranges for x, y, and z. For each possible x and y, the minimum z is C, and the maximum is min(D, x + y - 1). Because z has to be less than x+y, so the maximum z can be is x + y - 1.\n\nSo for each x and y, the number of valid z's is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1). But wait, only if x + y > C, otherwise there are no z's.\n\nWait, no. Because z starts at C. So for a given x and y, the valid z's are from C to min(D, x + y - 1). So the count is:\n\nif (x + y) > C:\n    count_z = min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1\nelse:\n    count_z = 0\n\nBut wait, z must be ≥ C, so if x + y ≤ C, then z can't be less than x + y, but z must be ≥ C. So if x + y < C, then no z satisfies both conditions. So yes, the condition is x + y > C.\n\nWait, no. Because for z to satisfy C ≤ z ≤ D and z < x + y, the lower bound is C, upper is min(D, x + y - 1). So if x + y <= C, then the upper bound is less than C, so no z exists. So in that case, count_z is zero.\n\nSo the formula for count_z is:\n\ncount_z = max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)\n\nBut only if x + y > C. Otherwise, it's zero.\n\nSo the total number of triangles is the sum over all x in [A, B], y in [B, C], of count_z.\n\nBut again, with B and C up to 5e5, iterating through all x and y is going to be O((B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1)), which could be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 operations. That's way too slow for Python.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative approach: find for each possible z in [C, D], the number of pairs (x, y) such that x ≤ B, y ≥ B, y ≤ C, x ≤ y, and x + y > z.\n\nWait, but z varies from C to D, so maybe we can find the range of z where for each z, we calculate how many (x, y) pairs satisfy x + y > z, with x in [A, B], y in [B, C], and x ≤ y.\n\nHmm. So for each z, the condition is x + y > z. And since x <= y, y >= B, x <= B.\n\nWait, perhaps for each z, we can compute the number of (x, y) pairs in their respective ranges that satisfy x + y > z.\n\nThen, summing over all z from C to D.\n\nBut again, z can be up to 5e5, so that's 5e5 iterations, each possibly taking O(1) time if we can find a mathematical way to compute the number of (x, y) pairs.\n\nSo let's model this. For a fixed z, what is the number of (x, y) pairs where x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], x <= y, and x + y > z.\n\nWe can model this as:\n\nFor each z, the count is the number of (x, y) pairs such that x ≤ y, x ∈ [A, B], y ∈ [B, C], and x + y > z.\n\nBut wait, since y >= B and x <= B, and x <= y, perhaps the constraints can be rewritten.\n\nAlternatively, for each z, the area we're interested in is x and y such that x ≤ y, x is between A and B, y is between B and C, and x + y > z.\n\nLet me see. Let's fix z. Then, for each possible x in [A, B], we can find the minimal y that satisfies y > z - x, and y >= B, and y >= x (since x <= y).\n\nSo for each x, the valid y's are in [max(B, x, z - x + 1), C]. The number of such y's is max(0, C - max(B, x, z - x + 1) + 1).\n\nBut summing this over x from A to B would give the count for this z. But again, if B is 5e5, doing this for each z would be O(5e5 * 5e5) = 2.5e11 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nWe need a way to compute this more efficiently.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's precompute the ranges where x and y can vary, and for each z, compute the sum quickly using prefix sums or mathematical formulas.\n\nLet me think about the possible x and y ranges.\n\nx is in [A, B]\ny is in [B, C]\nx ≤ y\nand x + y > z\n\nWe can rewrite the last condition as y > z - x.\n\nSince y >= B and y >= x, the lower bound for y is max(B, x, z - x + 1).\n\nBut perhaps we can find a way to model this as a 2D region and compute the integral over x and y.\n\nLet me visualize the (x, y) plane. x ranges from A to B, y ranges from B to C, and y >= x.\n\nIn this region, the line y = z - x divides the space. Points above this line (y > z - x) are the ones contributing to the count.\n\nSo for each x, the valid y's start from max(B, x, z - x + 1) up to C.\n\nSo for each x, the number of y's is:\n\ny_low = max(B, x, z - x + 1)\ny_high = C\ncount_y = max(0, y_high - y_low + 1)\n\nThe total count for z is the sum over x of count_y.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute this sum for each z efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the function f(x, z) = max(B, x, z - x + 1). Let's find the conditions when each of the terms is the maximum.\n\nCase 1: B >= x and B >= (z - x + 1)\nIn this case, y_low is B.\n\nCase 2: x >= B and x >= (z - x + 1)\nThen y_low is x.\n\nCase 3: (z - x + 1) >= B and (z - x + 1) >= x\nThen y_low is z - x + 1.\n\nCase 4: other combinations.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can find the regions where each case applies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the sum as an integral over x, finding the points where the expressions change.\n\nAnother approach: for each z, the count is the number of (x, y) pairs where x <= y, x ∈ [A,B], y ∈ [B,C], and y > z - x.\n\nWe can model this as the sum over x from A to B of the number of y's that satisfy y > z - x, y >= x, y >= B, y <= C.\n\nBut again, calculating this for each x is expensive.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's express the condition x + y > z as y > z - x.\n\nSince y >= B and y >= x, the effective lower bound for y is the maximum of B, x, z - x + 1.\n\nSo for each x, the lower bound is max(B, x, z - x + 1).\n\nWe can split the x's into intervals where this maximum changes.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's think about the function max(B, x, z - x + 1). It depends on the relationship between B, x, and z - x + 1.\n\nLet me consider different scenarios:\n\n1. When z - x + 1 <= B:\n   Then y_low is max(B, x, ...). Since B is bigger than z - x + 1, we have y_low = max(B, x).\n\n   So in this case, the condition depends on whether x >= B or not.\n\n   So for x <= B, y_low is B.\n   For x > B, y_low is x.\n\n2. When z - x + 1 > B:\n   Then y_low is max(x, z - x + 1).\n   Now, compare x and z - x + 1.\n\n   Let's find when x <= z - x + 1:\n   x <= (z + 1)/2.\n\n   So for x <= (z+1)/2, y_low is z - x + 1.\n   For x > (z+1)/2, y_low is x.\n\nSo combining all these, the sum can be broken into different regions based on x.\n\nBut even after this, integrating over x might still be complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps we can find the x ranges where each scenario applies and compute the sum accordingly.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\nFor a given z, we can compute the number of (x, y) pairs as follows:\n\nsum_{x=A to B} [ max(0, C - max(B, x, z -x + 1) + 1) ]\n\nBut this is O(B - A + 1) per z, which is too slow.\n\nAlternative Idea: Precompute for all possible x and y, but that's impossible due to the size.\n\nAlternative Idea: Find the x's for which z - x + 1 <= B. Then, for those x's, the y_low is B if x <= B, else y_low is x.\n\nSimilarly, for x's where z - x + 1 > B, then y_low is either z - x + 1 or x, depending on x.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given z, the critical x value is where z - x + 1 equals B. Let's solve for x:\n\nz - x + 1 = B → x = z - B + 1.\n\nSo for x < z - B + 1, z - x + 1 > B.\n\nWait, no: Let me see.\n\nIf x is smaller than (z - B + 1), then z - x + 1 is larger than B.\n\nFor example, suppose z=10, B=5.\n\nThen x = z - B + 1 = 6.\n\nFor x < 6: x=5 → 10-5+1=6>5.\n\nSo for x <= 5, z -x +1 >=6>5.\n\nWait, but wait, for x=5, z-x+1 is 10-5+1=6, which is greater than B=5.\n\nSo for x <= (z - B + 1), z -x +1 >= B.\n\nThus, for x <= s (where s = z - B + 1), the condition z -x +1 > B holds.\n\nOtherwise, for x > s, z -x +1 < B.\n\nSo this splits the x's into two regions: x <= s and x > s.\n\nBut s can be negative, in which case all x are in the first region.\n\nWait, let's compute s = z - B + 1.\n\nIf s < A, then for all x in [A, B], x > s → so all x are in the second region.\n\nIf s is between A and B, then x can be split into x <= s and x > s.\n\nIf s >= B, then all x are in the first region.\n\nSo for each z, the x's are divided into two parts based on whether x <= s or x > s.\n\nThis helps us break the sum into manageable parts.\n\nSo now, for each z, we can compute s = z - B + 1.\n\nThen, for x in [A, B], split into x <= s and x > s.\n\nBut before that, let's also note that for x <= s, the condition z -x +1 > B implies that y_low is the maximum of B, x, and z -x +1.\n\nBut since z -x +1 > B (because x <= s → z -x +1 >= B), then y_low is the maximum between x and z -x +1.\n\nSimilarly, for x > s, y_low is the maximum of B and x.\n\nSo for each z, we can compute two ranges of x:\n\n1. x <= s: y_low is max(x, z -x +1)\n2. x > s: y_low is max(B, x)\n\nAdditionally, for each x, y must be <= C.\n\nSo now, for each z, the sum can be split into two parts: x in [A, min(s, B)] and x in [max(A, s+1), B].\n\nBut wait, s can be less than A, so in that case, the second part is empty.\n\nSo for each z, we can handle these two regions separately.\n\nLet me outline the steps for each z:\n\nCompute s = z - B + 1.\n\nPart 1: x in [A, min(s, B)]\n\nFor each x in this part:\n\ny_low = max(x, z -x + 1)\ny_high = C\n\nBut y must be >= B, since y is in [B, C].\n\nSo y_low is the maximum of (x, z -x + 1, B).\n\nBut since for x <= s, z -x +1 >= B, so the max is between x and z -x +1.\n\nSo y_low = max(x, z -x +1)\n\ny_count = max(0, C - y_low + 1) if y_low <= C else 0.\n\nSum over x in part1.\n\nPart 2: x in [max(A, s+1), B]\n\nHere, y_low is max(B, x).\n\nBecause for x > s, z -x +1 < B.\n\nSo y_low = max(B, x).\n\nAgain, y must be <= C.\n\ny_count = max(0, C - y_low + 1) if y_low <= C else 0.\n\nSum over x in part2.\n\nTotal for z is part1_sum + part2_sum.\n\nNow, how to compute these sums efficiently.\n\nLet's think about Part 1:\n\nFor x in [A, min(s, B)], y_low is max(x, z -x + 1).\n\nWe can find the x where x = z -x +1 → x = (z+1)/2.\n\nLet me denote t = (z+1)/2.\n\nSo for x <= t, z -x +1 >= x → y_low is z -x +1.\n\nFor x > t, y_low is x.\n\nBut t may not be an integer, so we have to handle it carefully.\n\nSo in part1, the x's are in [A, min(s, B)].\n\nWe can find the intersection of this interval with x <= t and x > t.\n\nSo part1 is further split into two regions:\n\na) x <= t → y_low = z -x +1\n\nb) x > t → y_low = x\n\nBut only if x is within the part1's x range.\n\nSo for part1, the sum is the sum over x in a) plus the sum over x in b).\n\nLet me model this.\n\nLet me find the lower and upper bounds for x in a):\n\nx_start_a = A\n\nx_end_a = min(s, B, t_floor) → where t_floor is the floor of t.\n\nWait, t can be fractional. So for x <= t, which is x <= (z+1)/2.\n\nBut since x is integer, x can be up to floor(t) or ceil(t), depending on whether (z+1) is even or odd.\n\nWait, perhaps we can compute t as a real number, and find the x's where x <= t.\n\nSo for part1, x can be from A to min(s, B), but for each x in that range, whether x <= t or x > t.\n\nSo for part1, the x range is L = [A, R] where R = min(s, B).\n\nWithin L, x can be up to m, where m is the maximum x in L that is <= t.\n\nm = min(R, floor(t)).\n\nThe remaining x's are from m+1 to R.\n\nSo for part1a: x in [A, m], y_low = z - x +1.\n\nFor part1b: x in [m+1, R], y_low = x.\n\nSo for part1a:\n\ny_low = z - x +1.\n\nWe need to ensure that y_low >= B, but wait, earlier analysis shows that for x <= s, z -x +1 >= B.\n\nSo y_low is at least B.\n\nBut in part1, x <= s, which is x <= z - B +1 → z -x +1 >= B.\n\nSo for part1a, y_low is z -x +1.\n\nBut also, y_low must be <= C.\n\nSo for each x in part1a, the number of y's is max(0, C - (z -x +1) + 1) if (z -x +1) <= C, else 0.\n\nSo for part1a:\n\nsum_{x = A to m} [ max(0, C - (z -x +1) + 1) ] \n\nSimplify the expression inside max:\n\nC - (z -x +1) +1 = C - z + x -1 +1 = C - z + x.\n\nSo the term is max(0, x + (C - z)).\n\nSo sum_x (max(0, x + (C - z)) ), for x from A to m.\n\nSimilarly, for part1b:\n\ny_low is x.\n\nSo the number of y's is max(0, C - x + 1), but only if x <= C.\n\nSo sum_x (max(0, C - x + 1)).\n\nBut wait, x is in [m+1, R], and R is min(s, B).\n\nSo for part1b, x can be up to B, but if B is > C, then x can't exceed C, because y can't be less than x.\n\nWait, no: y can be up to C, but y must be >= x. So if x > C, then y can't exist, so the count is zero.\n\nSo for part1b, the term is max(0, C - x + 1) only if x <= C.\n\nElse, zero.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\npart1a_sum = sum from x=A to m of max(0, x + (C - z)).\n\nBut wait, x + (C - z) can be positive or negative.\n\nWait, since in part1a, x is in [A, m], which is part of the part1 where x <= s and x <= B.\n\nBut also, for part1a, z -x +1 >= B, so z >= x + B -1.\n\nBut x can be up to m, which is min(s, B, t).\n\nSo x can be up to s, which is z - B +1.\n\nSo substituting s = z - B +1, x can be up to s.\n\nSo z - x +1 >= B.\n\nWhich implies that x <= z - B +1.\n\nBut x is also <= B.\n\nSo for part1a, x can be up to min(s, B, t).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to proceed step by step.\n\nNow, for part1a_sum:\n\nWe can write it as sum_{x = a to b} max(0, x + (C - z)).\n\nWhere a is A, b is m.\n\nx + (C - z) = (C - z) + x.\n\nSo for x >= (z - C), this term is positive.\n\nSo the sum is from x = max(A, z - C) to min(m, z - C + ...) ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to find the x where x + (C - z) >=0.\n\nx >= (z - C).\n\nSo in the sum, x starts from A, but only contributes if x >= (z - C).\n\nSo the lower limit is max(A, z - C).\n\nThe upper limit is m.\n\nSo the sum is:\n\nstart = max(A, z - C)\n\nif start > m: part1a_sum =0.\n\nelse:\n\nnumber of terms is m - start +1.\n\neach term is (x + C - z), which increases by 1 each step.\n\nSo the sum is (start + m) * (m - start +1) / 2 - (z - C) * (m - start +1).\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, x starts at 'start' and goes to 'm', inclusive.\n\nEach term is x + (C - z) = x + K, where K = C - z.\n\nSo the sum is sum_{x=start}^m (x + K) = sum_{x=start}^m x + K*(m - start + 1).\n\nSum x from a to b is (b(b+1)/2) - ((a-1)a/2).\n\nSo:\n\nsum_x x = (m*(m+1) - (start-1)*start) // 2.\n\nsum_x (x + K) = sum_x x + K*(m - start +1).\n\nSo part1a_sum is:\n\nif start > m: 0\nelse:\n    sum_x = (m*(m+1) - (start-1)*(start)) // 2\n    part1a_sum = sum_x + (C - z) * (m - start + 1)\n\nBut wait, only if (x + (C - z)) >=0 for all x in [start, m], i.e., x >= (z - C).\n\nSo if (z - C) > m: then all x in [start, m] are < (z - C), so x + (C - z) is negative, so the sum is zero.\n\nSo we need to calculate start = max(A, z - C).\n\nIf start > m: part1a_sum = 0.\n\nElse:\n\ncompute as above.\n\nSimilarly, for part1b_sum:\n\ny_low is x.\n\ny must be <= C, and >= x.\n\nSo y_count = max(0, C - x +1).\n\nBut only if x <= C.\n\nBecause if x > C, then y can't be >= x and <= C, so y_count is zero.\n\nSo for part1b, x is in [m+1, R], where R = min(s, B).\n\nWe need to compute the sum for x in this range.\n\nBut x can't exceed C.\n\nSo the x range is:\n\nx_start = max(m+1, A)\nx_end = min(R, C)\n\nif x_start > x_end: part1b_sum = 0.\n\nelse:\n\nsum from x = x_start to x_end of (C - x + 1).\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence decreasing by 1 each step.\n\nThe number of terms is (x_end - x_start + 1).\n\nThe first term is (C - x_start + 1), last term is (C - x_end +1).\n\nSum = (first + last) * number_of_terms / 2.\n\nSo part1b_sum = ((C - x_start + 1) + (C - x_end +1 )) * (x_end - x_start + 1) // 2.\n\nNow, putting all this together for part1.\n\nThen, for part2, which is x in [max(A, s+1), B], and y_low is max(B, x).\n\nBut since s = z - B +1, and x > s → x > z - B +1 → z - x +1 < B.\n\nSo y_low is max(B, x).\n\nSo for x >= B: y_low is x.\n\nBut x is in [A, B], so x can be <= B.\n\nWait, because part2 is x in [max(A, s+1), B], and s+1 = z - B + 2.\n\nBut x is up to B.\n\nSo for x in part2, x can be <= B.\n\nSo y_low is max(B, x).\n\nBut since x is in [A, B], x can be >= B only if x = B.\n\nSo for x < B: y_low is B.\n\nFor x == B: y_low is B.\n\nWait, for x in [max(A, s+1), B], which could be x from s+1 to B.\n\nBut since s = z - B +1, and x > s → x >= s+1.\n\nBut s+1 = z - B + 2.\n\nSo for x in [s+1, B], we have:\n\nif x <= B: y_low is max(B, x).\n\nWhich is B if x < B, and B if x = B.\n\nWait, because for x < B, x <= B → y_low is B.\n\nFor x = B: y_low is max(B, B) = B.\n\nSo for all x in part2, y_low is B.\n\nWait, no. Because if x is less than B, then y_low is B. If x is equal to B, then y_low is B as well.\n\nSo for part2, regardless of x, y_low is B.\n\nWait, because in part2, x is in [max(A, s+1), B], and s+1 could be higher than B.\n\nWait, if s+1 > B, then part2's x range is empty.\n\nBut if s+1 <= B, then x is from s+1 to B.\n\nBut in all cases, x is <= B.\n\nSo y_low is max(B, x) = B.\n\nSo for part2, y_low is B.\n\nThus, for part2, the count is:\n\ny_count = max(0, C - B + 1) if B <= C.\n\nBecause y must be >= B and <= C.\n\nSo y_count = max(0, C - B +1).\n\nBut wait, only if B <= C, else y_count is zero.\n\nSo part2_sum = (max(0, C - B + 1)) * (number_of_x_in_part2).\n\nBut how many x's are in part2?\n\nThe x range is [x_start, x_end], where x_start = max(A, s+1), x_end = B.\n\nIf x_start > B: part2_sum is zero.\n\nElse:\n\ncount_x = B - x_start + 1.\n\nSo part2_sum = (C >= B ? (C - B +1) : 0) * count_x.\n\nBut wait, what if C < B? Then y cannot be >= B and <= C. So in that case, part2_sum is zero.\n\nSo part2_sum = max(0, C - B + 1) * count_x.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, the main steps for each z are:\n\n1. Compute s = z - B + 1.\n\n2. Determine R = min(s, B).\n\n3. Determine m = min(R, t), where t = (z+1)/2.\n\n   Wait, t is (z+1)/2, but since x is integer, m is the largest x in [A, R] that is <= t.\n\n   So m = min(R, floor(t)).\n\n   Or perhaps m is the largest x in [A, R] where x <= t.\n\n   So m = min(R, floor(t)).\n\n4. For part1a:\n\n   a. Compute start = max(A, z - C).\n\n   b. If start > m: part1a_sum = 0.\n\n   c. Else:\n\n      i. Compute the number of terms: terms = m - start + 1.\n\n      ii. sum_x = (m*(m+1) - (start-1)*start) // 2.\n\n      iii. part1a_sum = sum_x + (C - z) * terms.\n\n5. For part1b:\n\n   a. x_start = max(m + 1, A).\n\n   b. x_end = min(R, C).\n\n   c. If x_start > x_end: part1b_sum = 0.\n\n   d. Else:\n\n      i. num_terms = x_end - x_start + 1.\n\n      ii. first = C - x_start + 1.\n\n      iii. last = C - x_end + 1.\n\n      iv. part1b_sum = (first + last) * num_terms // 2.\n\n6. For part2:\n\n   a. x_start = max(A, s + 1).\n\n   b. x_end = B.\n\n   c. If x_start > x_end: part2_sum = 0.\n\n   d. Else:\n\n      i. count_x = x_end - x_start + 1.\n\n      ii. part2_sum = (C >= B ? (C - B + 1) : 0) * count_x.\n\n7. Total for z is part1a_sum + part1b_sum + part2_sum.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where part2's x_start is greater than B? Then part2_sum is zero.\n\nAlso, for part1b, x_end can't exceed R, which is min(s, B). So in part1b, x is in [m+1, R], but R is min(s, B), which could be >= B or not.\n\nBut since x can't exceed B, as x is in [A, B], part1b's x_end is min(R, C), but R is min(s, B).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model x_end as min(R, C).\n\nBut given that in part1, x is in [A, R], and R is min(s, B), which is <= B.\n\nSo x can't be larger than B.\n\nSo in part1b, x is in [m+1, R], which is <= B.\n\nSo x can be up to R, which is <= B.\n\nBut y_low is x, which needs to be <= C.\n\nSo for part1b, x can be up to min(R, C).\n\nThus, the code needs to handle that.\n\nNow, the question is: how to compute this efficiently for each z in [C, D].\n\nBut z can be up to 5e5, so even with O(1) per z, it's manageable.\n\nBut the problem is that z ranges from C to D, which can be up to 5e5, and for each z, the computation is O(1), but the mathematical expressions can get quite involved.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's find the z ranges where the conditions change, and compute the sum over z in bulk.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps precompute all possible s and t for each possible z, but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the overall sum by considering the three variables and their ranges.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of thinking about z, think about x, y, and z.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps it's better to proceed with the approach outlined earlier, and implement it with care.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nLoop through each z from C to D.\n\nFor each z:\n\nCompute s = z - B + 1.\n\nCompute R = min(s, B).\n\nCompute t = (z + 1) / 2.\n\nCompute m = min(R, floor(t)).\n\nThen compute part1a_sum and part1b_sum as described.\n\nCompute part2_sum.\n\nSum all these for z in [C, D].\n\nNow, the key is to implement this correctly.\n\nLet me test this approach with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 2 3 4\n\nSample Output: 4.\n\nLet's compute for each z in [3,4].\n\nz=3:\n\ns = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2.\n\nR = min(2, 2) =2.\n\nt = (3+1)/2=2.\n\nm = min(2, 2) =2.\n\nPart1a:\n\nstart = max(1, 3-4) = max(1, -1) =1.\n\nstart <= m (1 <=2): yes.\n\nsum_x is from 1 to 2.\n\nsum_x x: 1+2 =3.\n\n(C - z) =3-3=0.\n\nsum_x x + 0 =3.\n\nSo part1a_sum =3.\n\nPart1b:\n\nx_start = max(3, 2) →3.\n\nx_end = min(2, 3) →2.\n\nx_start > x_end: part1b_sum=0.\n\nPart2:\n\nx_start = max(1, 2+1)=3.\n\nx_end=2: x_start> x_end → part2_sum=0.\n\nTotal for z=3: 3+0+0=3.\n\nWait, but according to the sample explanation, one of the triangles is (1,3,3). So why is the count for z=3 3?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, wait, for z=3, the count is the number of (x,y) pairs where x<=y, x in [1,2], y in [2,3], and x + y >3.\n\nSo let's list all possible (x, y):\n\nx can be 1 or 2.\n\ny can be 2 or 3.\n\nBut x <= y.\n\nSo possible pairs:\n\n(1,2): 1+2=3 → not >3 → invalid.\n\n(1,3): 4>3 → valid.\n\n(2,2):4>3 → valid.\n\n(2,3):5>3 → valid.\n\nSo for z=3, there are 3 valid pairs.\n\nWait, so why does the code compute 3 for z=3.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nBut sample output says for z=3, the count is 3, which matches.\n\nSo the code is correct for z=3.\n\nNow, let's compute for z=4.\n\ns=4-2+1=3.\n\nR= min(3, 2)=2.\n\nt=(4+1)/2=2.5 → floor(t)=2.\n\nm= min(2, 2)=2.\n\nPart1a:\n\nstart = max(1,4-3) =1.\n\nsum x from 1 to 2.\n\nx + (3-4) = x-1.\n\nFor x=1: 0 → valid.\n\nx=2:1 → valid.\n\nSum is 0+1=1.\n\nSo part1a_sum=1.\n\nPart1b:\n\nx_start=3, x_end= min(2,3)=2 → x_start > x_end → part1b_sum=0.\n\nPart2:\n\nx_start = max(1,3+1)=4, x_end=2 → no.\n\nSo total for z=4 is 1.\n\nSo overall, z=3 gives 3, z=4 gives 1 → total 4.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nAnother sample: Input is 1 2 2 5.\n\nOutput is 3.\n\nLet me compute for z=2,3,4,5.\n\nWait, no: the constraints are C=2, D=5. So z ranges from 2 to5.\n\nBut wait, in this case, for each z, the count is:\n\nz=2:\n\ns=2-2+1=1.\n\nR= min(1, 2)=1.\n\nt=(2+1)/2=1.5 → m=1.\n\nPart1a:\n\nstart= max(1, 2-2)=1.\n\nsum x=1: x-0 →1.\n\nSo part1a_sum=1.\n\nPart1b:\n\nx_start=2, x_end= min(1,2)=1 → no.\n\nPart2:\n\nx_start = max(1, 2) →2.\n\nx_end=2.\n\ncount_x=1.\n\ny_low=B=2.\n\nC=2.\n\nSo y_count=2-2+1=1.\n\nSo part2_sum=1*1=1.\n\nTotal for z=2:1+0+1=2.\n\nz=3:\n\n",
