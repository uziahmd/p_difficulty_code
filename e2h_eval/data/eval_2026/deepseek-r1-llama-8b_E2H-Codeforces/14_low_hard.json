He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where given a number of trailing zeros m, I have to find all the positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. Then, output the count of such n's and the numbers themselves in order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because there are always more multiples of 2 than 5, the number of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So, for each multiple of 5, we add one zero, but also for multiples of higher powers like 25, 125, etc.\n\nSo the formula for the number of trailing zeros Z(n) is:\nZ(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nThe task is, given m, to find all n such that Z(n) = m. And then return how many such n's exist and list them in order.\n\nWait, but how do I find these n's? Since Z(n) is a non-decreasing function, once it reaches m, it will stay at m or increase. But sometimes, it can jump over m, meaning no solution exists for that m.\n\nFor example, if m is 0, then n must be less than 5. So n=1,2,3,4 have 0 trailing zeros. But if m=1, the possible n's are 5,6,7,8,9 because 5! is 120 (one zero), and 6! is 720, which also has one zero. Wait, no, wait: Let me think again.\n\nWait, 5! is 120 → 1 zero.\n6! is 720 → 1 zero.\n7! is 5040 → 1 zero.\n8! is 40320 → 1 zero.\n9! is 362880 → 1 zero.\n10! is 3628800 → 2 zeros.\n\nSo for m=1, the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. So five numbers.\n\nBut for some m, there might be no solutions. Like, maybe when m is between certain values, no n exists. So the first step is to find whether any n exists for the given m, and if yes, find all such n's.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Find the lower bound n_low where Z(n_low) = m.\n2. Find the upper bound n_high where Z(n_high) >= m, but Z(n_high-1) < m.\n3. If such n_low doesn't exist, output 0.\n4. Else, the numbers from n_low to n_high -1 inclusive are the solutions.\n\nWait, no. Because Z(n) can have a plateau where multiple n's give the same Z(n). So for m, the possible n's are consecutive numbers starting from the first n where Z(n)=m, and ending before the first n where Z(n) > m.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- For the given m, find the smallest n where Z(n) = m.\n- Then, find the smallest n where Z(n) = m + 1. All n's from the first to the second (exclusive) will have Z(n)=m.\n\nBut wait, what if Z(n) jumps from m to m+2? Then there are no solutions for m+1.\n\nSo first, I need to find all n where Z(n) = m. The numbers may form a continuous range or not.\n\nWait, no. Because the function Z(n) increases by at least 1 as n increases beyond certain points. For example, when n is a multiple of 5, Z(n) increases. But sometimes, adding 1 to n doesn't change Z(n) much.\n\nWait, no, let's see: For n=24, Z(24) is 4 (24/5=4, 24/25=0). For n=25, Z(25) is 6 (25/5=5, 25/25=1; total 6). So from 24 to 25, Z increases by 2.\n\nSo for m=5, the possible n's are 25,26,27,28,29,30? Or wait, let's compute Z(25)=6, so for m=5, the n's would be those where Z(n)=5.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the process as:\n\nFind the minimal n where Z(n) = m. Then find the maximal n where Z(n) = m. All n's in [n_min, n_max] are the solutions.\n\nSo the first step is to find n_min: the smallest n with Z(n)=m.\n\nOnce I have n_min, I can compute Z(n_min) and see",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Additionally, we need to list these integers in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) (factorial of \\( n \\)) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Counting Factors of 5**: The formula to count the number of trailing zeros \\( Z(n) \\) in \\( n! \\) is:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   This sum continues until the division yields zero.\n\n3. **Finding Valid \\( n \\)**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find all \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) = m \\). This can be done by finding the smallest \\( n \\) where \\( Z(n) = m \\) and then identifying the range of \\( n \\) values that also yield \\( m \\) trailing zeros.\n\n4. **Range Identification**: Once the smallest \\( n \\) (let's call it \\( n_{\\text{min}} \\)) is found, the next step is to find the largest \\( n \\) (let's call it \\( n_{\\text{max}} \\)) such that \\( Z(n) = m \\). All integers between \\( n_{\\text{min}} \\) and \\( n_{\\text{max}} \\) inclusive will have exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(m):\n    def trailing_zeros(n):\n        count = 0\n        while n > 0:\n            n = n // 5\n            count += n\n        return count\n\n    # Find the lower bound\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * (10**18)  # A large enough upper bound\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        tz = trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if tz < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    n_min = low\n\n    # Check if n_min actually gives m zeros\n    if trailing_zeros(n_min) != m:\n        return None  # No solution exists\n\n    # Now find the upper bound\n    low = n_min\n    high = 5 * (10**18)\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        tz = trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if tz > m:\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    n_max = high\n\n    # The numbers from n_min to n_max inclusive have exactly m zeros\n    return list(range(n_min, n_max + 1))\n\nm = int(input().strip())\nresult = count_trailing_zeros(m)\n\nif result is None:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    print(len(result))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function `trailing_zeros`**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) using the formula that sums the contributions from multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: The code uses binary search to efficiently find the smallest \\( n \\) (lower bound) where \\( Z(n) = m \\). It then finds the largest \\( n \\) (upper bound) where \\( Z(n) = m \\).\n\n3. **Result Handling**: After determining the valid range of \\( n \\), the code checks if any such \\( n \\) exists. If they do, it prints the count and the numbers; otherwise, it prints 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the constraints effectively, even for large values of \\( m \\).",
