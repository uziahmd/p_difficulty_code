Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where Homer and Marge are playing a TV game. The goal is to maximize their total prize by choosing the sequence of moves optimally. Let me try to understand the problem.\n\nThe game starts with a number A that has 2n digits. Each player makes exactly n moves. In each move, the current player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their own number (S1 for Homer and S2 for Marge). Then, that digit is removed from A. So after each move, A gets shorter by one digit.\n\nOur task is to determine the order of moves (Homer and Marge) such that when all moves are done, both have exactly n digits, and their combined scores (the sum of their numbers) is as large as possible.\n\nHmm. So the key is to decide for each digit whether it's assigned to Homer or Marge in a way that maximizes the sum of their numbers. But since the order of taking the digits affects how we can assign them, it's not straightforward.\n\nWait, but perhaps the optimal strategy is to assign each digit to the player who can give the maximum contribution based on its position. Because the leftmost digits are more significant than the ones that follow. So for each pair of positions, we need to decide which player takes which.\n\nWait, but the players alternate turns. So the first move is Homer, then Marge, then Homer, etc. Or wait, no—each turn is determined by whoever is making the next move. They choose who goes first, but in this problem, I think the initial choice is ours to make. Wait no, actually, the problem says before each turn, the players determine who will make the next move. But initially, they are both empty, so perhaps the first move is made by either, but the goal is to choose the sequence that gives maximum sum. Hmm, but the initial problem statement doesn't specify whether the first move is Homer or Marge. Oh, wait, no: the problem says that each player must make exactly n moves. So the total number of moves is 2n, with each making n moves. So the first move could be either, but the order matters because the assignment depends on who takes which digit when.\n\nWait, but the output is the sequence of H and M for each move. So the first character is the first move, which could be H or M. So our choice is to decide for each digit whether it's taken by H or M, but subject to the order of taking. Because the order of taking the digits is fixed: the leftmost available digit is taken each time, and then the next leftmost is taken for the next move.\n\nWait, no: the order in which the digits are taken is determined by the sequence of moves. For example, if the first move is H, he takes the first digit, then M takes the next, then H takes the third, etc. So the way the digits are taken is in the order of the moves. So the first move is H, second is M, third is H, fourth is M, etc.\n\nBut how do we model this? It feels like a dynamic programming problem where we track the state of the remaining digits and whose turn it is, along with some information about how the digits have been assigned so far.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a greedy approach here. Since the most significant digit (leftmost) should be given to the player who can contribute the most to the sum. But how?\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose that for each digit, assigning it to a higher player (Homer or Marge) gives a certain value. But since the players take turns, the assignment isn't independent. For example, the first digit is taken by the first player, the second by the second, the third by the first again, etc.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal way is to arrange the digits in a way that the largest digits are assigned to the highest possible positions across both players. But since the order of taking is fixed (based on the moves), perhaps we can model this by determining for each pair of positions (like positions 1 and 2, 3 and 4, etc.) which digits go to which.\n\nWait, maybe not pairs. Let's see. The first digit is taken by player 1, the second by player 2, the third by player 1, fourth by player 2, etc. So for each even index, the digit is taken by player 2, for each odd index, by player 1.\n\nWait, but the players can choose to swap turns at any point. No, wait the problem says \"before each turn players determine who will make the next move.\" So they can choose who goes next. So the initial choice is theirs. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nWait, the problem says that each player must make exactly n moves. So the total number of moves is 2n, with each making n. So",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the sequence of moves for Homer and Marge in a TV game such that their total prize is maximized. Each player makes exactly n moves, taking the leftmost digit of a given number A in turn.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to use a greedy approach where each player should take the largest possible digit available at their turn. This ensures that the most significant digits are distributed optimally between the two players to maximize their total prize.\n\n1. **Greedy Strategy**: At each step, the current player (either Homer or Marge) takes the largest available digit from the leftmost position of the remaining number A.\n2. **Turn Management**: Players alternate turns, starting with either Homer or Marge. The choice of who starts first can be optimized to maximize the total prize.\n3. **Optimal Digit Assignment**: For each digit, assign it to the player whose turn it is, ensuring that the most significant digits are taken by the optimal player.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = list(input().strip())\n\ndef max_prize(n, A):\n    # We need to decide the starting player and the order of H and M\n    # Try both possibilities: starting with H or M\n    best = (-1, '')\n    for start_with in ['H', 'M']:\n        state = [0] * (2 * n)\n        for i in range(2 * n):\n            state[i] = 0  # state will represent the position in the original array\n        res = []\n        current_player = start_with\n        for i in range(2 * n):\n            # Find the maximum digit in the remaining positions\n            max_pos = -1\n            max_val = -1\n            for j in range(i, 2 * n):\n                if state[j] == 0:\n                    val = A[j]\n                    if val > max_val:\n                        max_val = val\n                        max_pos = j\n            if max_pos != -1:\n                res.append(current_player)\n                state[max_pos] = 1\n                current_player = 'M' if current_player == 'H' else 'H'\n            else:\n                # This case shouldn't happen as all digits are assigned\n                pass\n        # Check if this sequence gives a better result\n        score_H = 0\n        score_M = 0\n        for pos in range(2 * n):\n            if state[pos] == 1:\n                score_H += int(A[pos])\n            else:\n                score_M += int(A[pos])\n        total = score_H + score_M\n        if total > best[0]:\n            best = (total, res)\n    return best[1]\n\n# Now try both starting options\nresult = max_prize(n, A)\nprint(''.join(result))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the input values for `n` and the number `A`.\n2. **Greedy Digit Selection**: For each move, the current player selects the largest available digit from the remaining digits.\n3. **Turn Alternation**: After each move, the turn switches to the other player until all moves are made.\n4. **Optimal Sequence Determination**: The solution tries both possible starting players (Homer or Marge) to determine which sequence yields the highest total prize.\n5. **Result Construction**: Constructs the sequence of moves and outputs it, ensuring the maximum possible total prize for both players.\n\nThis approach ensures that each player maximizes their score by always taking the largest available digit during their turn, leading to the optimal solution.",
