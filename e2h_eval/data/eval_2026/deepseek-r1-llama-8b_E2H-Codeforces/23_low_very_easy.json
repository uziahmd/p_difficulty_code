            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles, and I have to find the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form at least one mentsu. A mentsu can be a triplet (three same tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\nHmm, let's break it down. First, I need to process each of the three input strings. Each string represents a tile, like '1s' means 1 of suit s.\n\nSo for each of the three cases, I need to determine the minimal number of tiles to add to form a mentsu.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the output is three numbers, each corresponding to the three initial tiles. So for each tile, we calculate how many more tiles are needed if that tile is part of a mentsu. Or maybe it's per each possible way the mentsu could be formed from the initial three.\n\nNo, maybe the output is three separate answers, each indicating the minimal tiles needed for each of the three scenarios where that particular tile is part of a mentsu.\n\nWait, looking at the example:\n\nInput:\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nOutput:\n['0', '0', '1']\n\nIn the first case, the three tiles form a shuntsu (1s, 2s, 3s), so 0 extra tiles needed.\n\nSecond case: three 9m, which is a triplet, so 0.\n\nThird case: 3p,9m,2p. She needs to add one tile to make either 1p,4p, or perhaps another arrangement. Like adding 1p would form 1p,2p,3p, making a shuntsu.\n\nSo for each of the three initial hands, we need to compute the minimal number of tiles to add to form any possible mentsu, considering all possibilities based on their own tiles.\n\nSo the approach is: For each of the three tiles, treat them as the starting point, and see what's the minimal number of tiles needed to complete a mentsu that includes any of the possible combinations involving those tiles.\n\nWait, perhaps for each of the three initial tiles, we generate all possible mentsu options that can include that tile with the current set plus some additions, and find the minimal count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the steps are:\n\nFor each of the three initial hands, evaluate all possible ways to form a mentsu (either triplet or sequence) using the existing tiles plus some new ones, and find the minimal number of new tiles needed.\n\nBut that might be computationally intensive. But since the input is small (three tiles), it's manageable.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nEach initial hand is a list of three tiles. For each tile in the hand, I can consider whether it can be part of a triplet or a sequence, possibly after adding some tiles.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to look at all possible ways to form a mentsu, given the initial three tiles, and then compute the minimal number of tiles needed.\n\nWait, but the problem says she can draw any tiles, including those already present. So even if she has duplicates, she can add more.\n\nSo for each of the three initial hands, we can generate all possible mentsu options, and for each option, calculate how many tiles she already has that fit, then subtract from 3, which is the total needed for a mentsu, and take the maximum of 0 and (3 - existing_count). Then find the minimal such value across all possible mentsu options.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because a mentsu requires exactly three tiles. For a given mentsu, count how many of the current tiles match the required tiles. The minimal number of additional tiles is max(0, 3 - current_count).\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each of the three initial hands, create a list of all possible mentsu (triplets and sequences) that can be formed, considering that she can add any tiles.\n\n2. For each possible mentsu, count how many tiles in the initial hand match the mentsu.\n\n3. Compute the number of tiles needed to complete the mentsu: 3 - current_count.\n\n4. Find the minimal such number across all possible mentsu for that initial hand.\n\nWait, but the mentsu can consist of any combination of tiles, not necessarily including the initial tiles. So for the initial hand, any possible mentsu is a candidate, regardless of whether it uses existing tiles.\n\nWait no, because when she draws tiles, she can add any tiles. So the mentsu can be formed by any set of three tiles, possibly including some that are already present.\n\nBut for each initial hand, we need to find all possible mentsu",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) from her initial three tiles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Mentsu Types**: A mentsu can be either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n2. **Generate All Possible Mentsu**: For each initial hand of three tiles, generate all possible triplets and sequences that can be formed using any combination of tiles, including adding new ones.\n3. **Count Matching Tiles**: For each generated mentsu, count how many of the current tiles match the required tiles of the mentsu.\n4. **Calculate Extra Tiles Needed**: Compute the number of extra tiles needed to complete the mentsu as `max(0, 3 - current_count)`.\n5. **Find Minimum Extra Tiles**: For each initial hand, find the minimum number of extra tiles needed across all possible mentsu.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_extra_tiles(tiles):\n    suits = {'m', 'p', 's'}\n    tile_list = [tile.strip() for tile in tiles]\n    counts = {}\n    \n    # Count occurrences of each tile\n    for t in tile_list:\n        counts[t] = counts.get(t, 0) + 1\n    \n    # Generate all possible triplets and sequences\n    min_needed = float('inf')\n    \n    # Check for triplets\n    for tile in counts:\n        if counts[tile] >= 3:\n            min_needed = 0\n            break\n        else:\n            pass\n    \n    if min_needed == 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Check for sequences\n    from itertools import product\n    for suit in suits:\n        # Generate all possible sequences of length 3\n        for start in range(1, 10):\n            for step in [1, -1]:\n                seq = list(range(start, start + 3 * step, step))\n                # Adjust to ensure numbers are between 1-9\n                if step == -1:\n                    adjusted = [x if x > 0 else 9 for x in seq]\n                else:\n                    adjusted = [x if x <=9 else x for x in seq]\n                adjusted = [str(a) + suit for a in adjusted]\n                unique_seq = list(set(adjusted))\n                current = 0\n                for t in unique_seq:\n                    if t in counts:\n                        current += counts[t]\n                extra = 3 - current\n                if extra < min_needed:\n                    min_needed = extra\n    \n    return max(0, min_needed)\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\n\ntiles = []\nfor _ in range(3):\n    line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    tiles.append(line)\n\n# Process each tile's hand\nresults = []\nfor hand in tiles:\n    results.append(min_extra_tiles(hand))\n\n# Print the results\nfor res in results:\n    print(res)\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution involves checking each initial hand of tiles to determine the minimum number of extra tiles needed to form a mentsu. It first checks for triplets by counting occurrences of each tile. If a triplet is already present, no extra tiles are needed. If not, it then checks for sequences by generating all possible sequences for each suit and calculating how many tiles are needed to complete each sequence. The minimum number of extra tiles across all possible mentsu is determined and returned for each initial hand. This approach ensures that all possible ways to form a mentsu are considered efficiently.",
