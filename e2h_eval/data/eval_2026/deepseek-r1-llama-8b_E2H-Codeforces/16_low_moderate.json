Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a plane with n infinite line roads. Each road is given by an equation a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0. These roads divide the plane into blocks. The home and university are in some blocks. My goal is to find the minimum number of steps needed to move from home's block to the university's block. A step is moving between blocks that share a non-zero boundary segment.\n\nHmm. So each step can be thought of as crossing a road, but not just any crossing—specifically, moving across a road that separates two adjacent blocks.\n\nWait, no. Because the movement is allowed only if the two blocks share a common border of non-zero length. So, for example, two blocks can be separated by a single intersection point, but if their shared boundary is just that point, then you can't move between them in one step. So, the key is that to move from one block to another, they must share a segment (not just a point) of a road.\n\nSo how do we model this?\n\nI think the problem can be reduced to finding the minimal number of lines that separate the home and university points. Because each time you cross a line, you switch blocks. But since each line can only contribute once, the minimal steps would be the number of lines that separate the two points, but perhaps minus one or something like that.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Each line that the home and university are on the same side of divides nothing, but a line that has the home on one side and the university on the other contributes to the count.\n\nSo, for each road, check whether the home and university are on opposite sides. For each such road, it's a potential step. But since each step moves across exactly one road, the minimal steps required would be the number of such roads that separate the two points.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Because if all the separating roads are concurrent, then maybe you can cross them all in a single step. No, wait, because each step is a transition between two blocks connected by a shared boundary. So each step corresponds to crossing one road. So if there are k roads that separate the home and university, then the minimal steps would be k.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Because some roads might intersect each other, allowing us to cross multiple roads in a single step? Or wait, no—each step is moving through a single road's boundary.\n\nNo, wait, perhaps each step allows crossing one road. So if there are k such roads, the minimal steps are k.\n\nBut wait, maybe some of these roads don't form a path between the two points. Hmm, perhaps not. Because the minimal path would involve crossing each of these separating roads exactly once.\n\nSo the approach is: for each line, determine whether the home and university are on opposite sides. The count of such lines is the answer.\n\nWait, but that doesn't account for the fact that some lines might not be directly separable. For example, imagine three lines forming a triangle around a region. Then, to get from home to university, you might need to cross two lines, but those two lines could both separate the points.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to compute the number of lines that separate the two points. That's the minimal number of steps needed.\n\nBecause each such line must be crossed exactly once, and each crossing is a step.\n\nYes, because each step can only cross one line at a time, since each step is moving across a single road's boundary.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n1. For each of the n lines, determine whether the home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2) are on opposite sides of the line. If yes, increment the count.\n\n2. The count is the minimal number of steps required.\n\nBecause each line that separates the two points must be crossed exactly once. And you can't cross more than once because each step is a single line.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of lines where the home and university are on different sides.\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nLet's test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\nHome: 1 1\nUniversity: -1 -1\nn=2\nLine 1: 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y=0. Home is at y=1 (above), university at y=-1 (below). So they are on opposite sides. So count +=1.\nLine 2: 1x + 0y + 0 = 0 → x=0. Home is at x=1 (right), university at x=-1 (left). So they are on opposite sides. Count is now 2.\n\nSample Output is 2, which matches.\n\nAnother example: suppose n=3 lines, and two of them separate the points, but the third doesn",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step allows moving between blocks that share a common boundary segment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem can be reduced to counting how many roads (lines) separate the home and university points. Each line that separates these two points will require exactly one step to cross.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each road, check if the home and university lie on opposite sides of the road. If they do, count this road as a separator.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - For each road, compute the value of the road's equation at the home and university coordinates.\n   - If the signs of these values are different, it means the home and university are on opposite sides of the road, so increment the count.\n   - The total count of such roads gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef readints():\n    import sys\n    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    # Compute for home: a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    # Compute for university: a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n- **Checking Each Road**: For each road, it evaluates the position of the home and university relative to the road using the equation of the line.\n- **Counting Separators**: If the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, it increments the count.\n- **Output**: The total count of such roads is printed, which represents the minimum number of steps needed to move from the home's block to the university's block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the required steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their evaluation at given points, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
