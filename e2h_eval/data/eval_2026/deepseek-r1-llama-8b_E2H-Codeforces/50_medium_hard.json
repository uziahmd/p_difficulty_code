    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the sum of d(1,n) over all \"good\" trees. Hmm, let's try to break it down.\n\nFirst, what's a good tree? The definition says each edge is either 1 or -1, and for every vertex i, the product of the edges incident to it is -1. Oh right, because for each vertex, the product has to be -1. So that means each node has an odd number of -1 edges connected to it.\n\nWait, no. Because multiplying an even number of -1s would give 1, so each node must have an odd number of -1 edges. But wait, each edge contributes to two nodes. So if every node has an odd number of -1 edges, what does that imply about the structure of the tree?\n\nHmm, perhaps the entire tree must form a certain parity structure. Let me think about it. Each edge is either +1 or -1. For the product condition to hold for all nodes, perhaps the tree must have exactly one node with a certain property. Like, maybe only the root (node 1) can have a certain parity, or something like that.\n\nWait, considering that each edge affects two nodes. So the sum of the parities (whether each edge is -1 or not) for all nodes must be even. Because each edge contributes two to the total count of -1 edges. So if every node has an odd number of -1 edges, then the sum of all such counts across nodes is equal to twice the number of edges (since each edge is counted twice). Wait, but each node's count is odd, and there are n nodes. So the total sum is n multiplied by 1 (mod 2), which is n mod 2. But since each edge contributes 2 to the total (each edge is counted in two nodes), the sum is even. So n must be even? Because 2k = n mod 2. So n must be even. Otherwise, it's impossible to have all nodes with an odd number of -1 edges. Because if n is odd, then the sum of all node's edge counts (each being odd) is odd, but that's impossible because each edge contributes 2, making the total even. So for n odd, there are zero good trees.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So for n=1, the tree has zero edges. The product condition requires that each node's incident edges product is -1. For n=1, there are no edges, so the product is 1. So it's not -1, so it's not a good tree. Wait, but for n=1, the sample input says when n=2, the output is 0, but for n=1, according to the note, the answer is 0 because d(1,1) is 0. So for n=1, regardless of the conditions, it's 0.\n\nSo putting it together: if n is 1, output 0. If n is odd and greater than 1, output 0. Otherwise, for even n, we need to compute the sum.\n\nSo the first thing I should do is check if n is 1 or odd. If yes, output 0.\n\nBut what about n=2? According to the sample input, when n=2, the answer is -1 mod 998244353, which is 998244352. So for n=2, the sum is -1.\n\nWait, but why? Let's see. For n=2, the tree has one edge. The product for each node must be -1. So the edge must be -1, because node 1's product is the edge, which needs to be -1. Similarly, node 2's product is the same edge, which also needs to be -1. So the edge must be -1. So the only possible tree is the one with the single edge as -1. So the sum is d(1,2) = -1.\n\nSo for n=2, the answer is -1, which modulo 998244353 is 998244352.\n\nSo for even n, how to proceed?\n\nI think the key is to model the problem combinatorially. Let's consider the structure of a good tree.\n\nEach node must have an odd number of -1 edges. Since the tree is connected, each node except the leaves has some edges. Wait, but perhaps the tree must have exactly one node with a certain property. Let me think.\n\nSince each edge is between two nodes, the product for each node is determined by the edges connected to it. So for a node u, the product is the product of all edges adjacent to u. We want this product to be -1.\n\nLet me model each edge as a variable x_e, which is either +1 or -1. Then for each node u, the product of x_e over all edges e incident to u is -1.\n\nThis forms a system of equations. Let's see: for each node, the product of its edges is -1.\n\nNow, since the tree is connected and has n-1 edges, perhaps we can find a way to assign the edge weights such that all these product constraints are satisfied.\n\nWait, but for a tree, the number of edges is n-1. So the number of variables is n-1, and the number of equations is n. So unless the equations are dependent, this system may not have a solution.\n\nIn our case, for the system to be solvable, the product of all the equations (the product of all the variables) must be (-1)^n. Because each equation contributes a factor of -1, and the product of all equations is the product of all variables raised to the power of the number of edges incident to each node. Wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think about the product of all the equations. Each edge is part of two equations (for its two endpoints). So the product of all the equations is the product of all variables squared. Because each variable is multiplied twice. So the product of all equations is (product of x_e^2) for all edges e. Which is 1 for each e, so overall product is 1.\n\nOn the other hand, the product of all the equations (each being -1) is (-1)^n, since each equation contributes a -1. So:\n\n(-1)^n = 1.\n\nWhich implies that n must be even. So yes, for the system to have a solution, n must be even. Which aligns with our earlier observation.\n\nSo for even n >= 2, there exists at least one solution.\n\nBut wait, when n is even, is the system consistent? Yes, because the product of all the equations is 1, which equals (-1)^n when n is even.\n\nSo for even n, the system is consistent, and the solution space is non-empty.\n\nSo now, for even n, how many good trees are there, and what is the sum of d(1,n) across all such trees?\n\nHmm, let's think about the structure of the good trees.\n\nEach edge is assigned +1 or -1, subject to the product constraints for each node. Additionally, the tree structure is fixed, but the edge weights vary.\n\nWait, no. The tree structure is given as any possible tree on n labeled vertices. So for each tree, we can assign edge weights to make it good, provided the constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut the problem statement says that each tree is considered as a combination of its structure and edge weights. So for each possible tree structure, we can assign edge weights (1 or -1) such that the product constraints are satisfied.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem statement says that the number of distinct edge-weighted trees is n^{n-2} * 2^{n-1}. So each tree is considered different if the structure differs or the edge weights differ.\n\nSo for each possible tree structure (Cayley's formula gives n^{n-2} possibilities), each edge can have 2 choices, so 2^{n-1} possible weight assignments. But the constraints will eliminate some of these assignments.\n\nOur goal is to find, among all such edge-weighted trees that are \"good\", the sum of d(1,n) across all of them.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe we can model the problem differently.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the assignment of edge weights as a function f(e) ∈ {+1, -1} for each edge e.\n\nThe conditions are that for each node u, the product of f(e) for all edges e incident to u is -1.\n\nWe can model this as a system of equations. Each equation corresponds to a node u: product_{e ∈ E(u)} f(e) = -1.\n\nWe need to find all such functions f and compute the sum of d(1,n) over all such f, where d(1,n) is the sum of f(e) along the path from 1 to n.\n\nWait, but the path from 1 to n depends on the tree's structure. So each tree structure will contribute differently based on the edges along its unique path between 1 and n.\n\nThis complicates things because the sum over all trees involves considering all possible tree structures and their respective paths.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can find a way to express the sum without considering the specific tree structure, or find a way to compute it in terms of independent contributions from edges or nodes.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each edge, we can determine how often it appears in the path from 1 to n across all good trees.\n\nThen, the sum of d(1,n) across all good trees would be the sum over all edges e of (number of times e is in the path) multiplied by f(e).\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, but the function f is constrained such that the product for each node is -1. So the function f is not arbitrary. It must satisfy these product constraints.\n\nSo perhaps we can model f as a solution to this system of equations.\n\nLet me think about the degrees of freedom in assigning f.\n\nFor each tree structure, the number of valid f assignments depends on the tree's structure. But since the problem asks for the sum over all possible trees, perhaps each tree contributes a certain amount to the sum, and we can find a general expression that applies to all trees.\n\nWait, but how? This seems tricky.\n\nAnother idea: Let's fix the tree structure. Then, for that fixed tree, how many valid f assignments are there, and what is the sum of d(1,n) over those assignments?\n\nThen, since all trees contribute, perhaps we can find the sum over all trees by considering each edge's contribution across all possible trees.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed by considering the parity constraints.\n\nEach node must have an odd number of -1 edges. So for each node u, the number of edges incident to u with f(e) = -1 is odd.\n\nThis is similar to a parity constraint. So perhaps the problem can be modeled using linear algebra over GF(2), treating each edge as a binary variable indicating whether it's -1 or +1. But I'm not sure how to proceed with that.\n\nWait, but in GF(2), the product constraints become XOR constraints. For each node u, the sum (mod 2) of the variables (1 if f(e) is +1, 0 if -1) for edges incident to u must be 1. Because the product of f(e)s is -1, which is equivalent to having an odd number of -1 edges.\n\nSo each node u imposes an equation: sum_{e ∈ E(u)} x_e ≡ 1 mod 2, where x_e is 1 if f(e) is -1, 0 otherwise.\n\nThis is a system of linear equations. The variables are x_e for each edge e, and the equations are for each node u.\n\nWhat is the rank of this system? The number of equations is n, the number of variables is n-1 (since a tree has n-1 edges). So the system is likely to be overdetermined, but for n even, it's consistent.\n\nWait, but the sum of all equations would be the sum over all nodes u of sum_{e ∈ E(u)} x_e ≡ sum_{u} 1 mod 2. The left side is 2*(sum of x_e) mod 2, which is 0. So the right side is sum_{u} 1 mod 2. So 0 ≡ n mod 2. So for n even, this holds.\n\nSo for even n, the system is consistent, and the solution space is a coset of the kernel.\n\nWait, but the kernel of the system is the set of solutions to the homogeneous system (all equations equal to 0). So the solution space is affine, consisting of a particular solution plus any solution to the homogeneous system.\n\nSo for each tree structure, the number of valid f assignments is 2^{k}, where k is the dimension of the kernel. But since the tree structure is fixed, perhaps the kernel's dimension varies depending on the tree.\n\nBut this seems complex. Maybe we can find a pattern or a general formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum over all good trees can be expressed as follows:\n\nFor each edge e in the tree, the number of times it is included in the path from 1 to n across all good trees is equal to the number of ways to assign the rest of the edges such that the constraints are satisfied. Then, multiply this by f(e) (which is either 1 or -1) and sum over all edges.\n\nBut again, this seems difficult.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about the constraints. For each node u, the product of edges around u is -1. So, the parity of the number of -1 edges around u is odd.\n\nBut how does this affect the path from 1 to n?\n\nWait, the path from 1 to n is a simple path in the tree. Let's denote this path as P.\n\nEach edge along P is part of the path, and contributes to the sum d(1,n).\n\nBut the constraints on each node may influence whether an edge is included in the path or not.\n\nWait, perhaps the constraints imply that the path has a certain parity. Or perhaps the number of -1 edges on the path is related to some function of n.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's easier to model the problem in terms of the product along the path.\n\nWait, d(1,n) is the sum of f(e) along the path from 1 to n. Let's denote this sum as S.\n\nWe need to sum S over all good trees.\n\nEach edge e can be in the path of certain trees. So perhaps we can model the contribution of each edge e as (number of times e is in the path across all good trees) multiplied by f(e).\n\nBut the problem is determining how often e is in the path, considering all possible trees and assignments that satisfy the constraints.\n\nBut this seems challenging.\n\nWait, perhaps the constraints impose that the path from 1 to n has an even number of edges, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product of all edges in the path is fixed. Let's see:\n\nEach node in the path (except 1 and n) is the endpoint of two edges along the path. The product of the edges around each such node must be -1.\n\nSo for a node u on the path (not 1 or n), the two edges along the path contribute to its product. So the product of those two edges must be -1.\n\nSimilarly, for node 1, the product of all edges incident to it, including the first edge of the path, must be -1. For node n, the product of all edges incident to it, including the last edge of the path, must be -1.\n\nWait, let's model this. Let the path be e1, e2, ..., ek, where e1 is between 1 and its neighbor, and ek is between the neighbor of n.\n\nFor node 1: the product of e1 and any other edges connected to it must be -1.\n\nSimilarly, for node n: the product of ek and any other edges connected to it must be -1.\n\nFor each intermediate node u on the path: the product of e_{i} and e_{i+1} must be -1, because those are the two edges incident to u along the path.\n\nSo, combining these, the path's edges must form a sequence where each pair of consecutive edges multiplies to -1, and the edges incident to 1 and n must each multiply to -1 when combined with their other edges.\n\nThis seems to create a kind of chain structure. Let's think recursively.\n\nSuppose the path has length k. Then, the product of all edges in the path is the product of the edges, which is the product of e1, e2, ..., ek.\n\nBut each consecutive pair must multiply to -1, so e_i * e_{i+1} = -1.\n\nThis implies that e1 * e2 = -1, e2 * e3 = -1, etc.\n\nMultiplying all these, we get e1 * e2 * ... * ek = (-1)^(k-1).\n\nBut the product of the entire path is e1 * e2 * ... * ek.\n\nBut what about the product of all edges in the tree? Well, for each node, the product of edges around it is -1. So the product of all edges in the tree is 1, because each edge is counted twice (once for each node it connects), and each node contributes a factor of -1. So the total product is (-1)^n.\n\nWait, the product of all edges in the tree is the product of all x_e, which is equal to the product of all the node products, each of which is -1. But each edge is in two node products. So the total product is (-1)^n, because each x_e is squared in the product of all node products.\n\nSo the product of all edges is 1, because (-1)^n is 1 when n is even.\n\nSo for the path, the product is e1 * e2 * ... * ek = (-1)^(k-1).\n\nBut the product of all edges is 1, so the product of the path and the remaining edges must be 1.\n\nThe remaining edges are those not in the path. So if the tree has m edges in the path, then the product of the remaining n-1 - m edges must be equal to 1 / (product of the path edges).\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the path's product is fixed. Let me see.\n\nFor the path, each pair of consecutive edges multiplies to -1, so the product of all path edges is (-1)^{k-1}, where k is the number of edges in the path.\n\nBut the product of all edges in the tree is 1, so the product of the path edges multiplied by the product of the remaining edges must equal 1.\n\nSo, product(path) * product(non-path) = 1.\n\nThus, product(non-path) = 1 / product(path).\n\nBut since all edges are ±1, 1 / product(path) is just the inverse, which is the same as product(path) because 1 and -1 are their own inverses.\n\nWait, no. Because 1 / (-1) is -1. So yes, product(non-path) = product(path).\n\nSo product(non-path) = (-1)^{k-1}.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure how this helps.\n\nWait, perhaps for the path, the product is fixed. Let me think about the minimal case.\n\nFor n=2, the path has one edge. So the product is e1 = -1. So the product of non-path edges is nothing (since there are none), so that's 1. So e1 must be -1, which matches the sample.\n\nFor n=4, the tree could be a straight line 1-2-3-4. The path is 1-2-3-4, with edges e1 (1-2), e2 (2-3), e3 (3-4).\n\nEach consecutive pair must multiply to -1:\n\ne1 * e2 = -1 → e2 = -e1\n\ne2 * e3 = -1 → e3 = -e2 = e1\n\nSo the product of the path is e1 * e2 * e3 = e1 * (-e1) * e1 = (-1)e1^2 = -1.\n\nSo the product of the path is -1.\n\nThus, the product of the non-path edges is also -1. But for n=4, the tree has 3 edges. So the non-path edges are none—wait, no. Wait, for the path, all edges are part of the path. So there are no non-path edges. So product(non-path) is 1. But according to the above, product(non-path) must be equal to product(path) = -1. That's a contradiction.\n\nWait, that suggests that my earlier assumption is wrong. So perhaps the path cannot have all edges in the tree for n>2.\n\nWait, perhaps for larger n, the path includes more edges, and the product of the path is determined accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product of the path is fixed as (-1)^{m-1}, where m is the number of edges in the path. And the product of the remaining edges must be equal to that as well.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for any tree, the path from 1 to n must consist of an odd number of edges. Because the product of the path edges is -1, which is achieved when the number of edges is odd (since each pair of edges multiplies to -1, leading to an overall product of -1 for an odd number of edges).\n\nWait, no. For example, in n=4, the path is 3 edges, which is odd. Product is -1. So that works.\n\nBut what if the path had an even number of edges? Then the product would be 1, but the constraints require that the product for each node along the path must be -1. So that might not be possible.\n\nSo perhaps the path must have an odd number of edges.\n\nWait, but in the tree, the path from 1 to n is unique. So the number of edges in the path is always the same as the distance between 1 and n.\n\nSo for a tree, the path's length is fixed. So for each tree, the number of edges in the path is fixed.\n\nBut how does this relate to the product constraints?\n\nWait, perhaps the product of the edges along the path must be -1, because each internal node on the path has exactly two edges in the path (so their product is -1), and the first and last nodes must have an odd number of -1 edges in their incident edges, which includes the path edges.\n\nSo the product of the path edges must be such that the product at each node is -1.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product of the path edges must be -1, regardless of the tree structure.\n\nWait, let's think about n=4.\n\nIn the path 1-2-3-4, the product of the path edges is e1 * e2 * e3 = (-1)*(-1)*(-1) = -1.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the product is -1.\n\nAnother example: suppose the tree is a star, with 1 connected to 2,3,4,...,n. Then the path from 1 to n is the direct edge between 1 and n. So the product is just that edge's value, which must be -1. So the product is -1.\n\nWait, so in that case, the product is -1.\n\nSo for any tree, the product of the edges along the path from 1 to n must be -1.\n\nIs that always true?\n\nYes, because each node on the path (except 1 and n) has exactly two edges in the path, which must multiply to -1. So their product is -1. Then, the product of all edges in the path is the product of these pairs, which results in (-1)^(k-1), where k is the number of edges in the path.\n\nWait, but for n=4, the path has 3 edges, which is odd. So the product is (-1)^(3-1) = 1? Wait, no. Earlier calculation for n=4's straight line path gives product -1.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me re-examine.\n\nIn the straight line path 1-2-3-4, the edges are e1 (1-2), e2 (2-3), e3 (3-4).\n\nEach internal node (2 and 3) must have their product of edges as -1. So e1 * e2 = -1, and e2 * e3 = -1.\n\nSo e1 = -e2, e3 = -e2.\n\nThen, the product of all three edges is e1 * e2 * e3 = (-e2) * e2 * (-e2) = (-1)(e2^2)(-1) = e2^2, which is 1. Wait, but this contradicts earlier reasoning.\n\nWait, no. Wait, e2 is either +1 or -1. So e2^2 is 1. So e1*e2*e3 = 1.\n\nBut earlier, for this case, the product of the path edges was -1. So now I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-calculate.\n\nGiven e1 * e2 = -1 → e1 = -e2.\n\ne2 * e3 = -1 → e3 = -e2.\n\nSo e1 = -e2, e3 = -e2.\n\nSo the product is e1 * e2 * e3 = (-e2) * e2 * (-e2) = (-1) * e2^2 * (-1) = ( (-1)^2 ) * e2^2 = 1*1 = 1.\n\nWait, so the product is 1? But earlier I thought it was -1.\n\nHmm, but then how does that fit with the constraints?\n\nBecause for node 2, the product is e1 * e2 = -1, which is correct.\n\nFor node 3, the product is e2 * e3 = -1, which is correct.\n\nFor node 1: the product is e1. Since the product must be -1, e1 must be -1.\n\nSimilarly, for node 4: the product is e3, which must be -1.\n\nSo e1 must be -1, e3 must be -1.\n\nSo from e1 = -e2 → e2 = 1.\n\nThen e3 = -e2 → e3 = -1.\n\nSo the product of the path is e1 * e2 * e3 = (-1)*1*(-1) = 1.\n\nBut according to the product constraints for the tree as a whole, the product of all edges is 1 (since n is even). So the product of the path (1) multiplied by the product of the remaining edges (which is zero in this case, since all edges are in the path) is 1. So that's consistent.\n\nSo the product of the path is 1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was -1. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.\n\nSo perhaps the product of the path is 1.\n\nWait, but in the case where the path is a single edge (n=2), the product is -1, which is correct because the product of the path is -1.\n\nIn the case of the straight line tree for n=4, the product of the path is 1.\n\nSo perhaps the product of the path is 1 for any tree where the path has an even number of edges, and -1 when it has an odd number.\n\nBut wait, for n=2, the path has 1 edge (odd), product is -1.\n\nFor n=4, the path has 3 edges (odd), product is 1. Wait, that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, for the straight line tree with n=4, the path has 3 edges. Each internal node's product is -1. The product of all edges in the tree is 1.\n\nSo the product of the path is 1, as calculated.\n\nSo for the path with 3 edges, the product is 1.\n\nSo perhaps the product of the path is determined by the parity of the number of edges in the path.\n\nIf the path has an odd number of edges, then the product is 1. If even, product is 1? No, that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let's think of another example.\n\nSuppose the tree is a star with center 1, connected to 2,3,4. The path from 1 to 4 is just the edge between 1 and 4. So the product is the value of that edge, which must be -1. So the product is -1.\n\nSo the product of the path is -1.\n\nAnother example: a tree where 1 is connected to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, and 3 to 5. The path from 1 to 4 is 1-2-3-4, which is 3 edges. So the product is 1.\n\nWait, but in this case, the product of the path is 1.\n\nSo, the product of the path depends on the number of edges in the path. So if the path has k edges, the product is (-1)^(k-1).\n\nWait, in the case where k is 1 (n=2), product is (-1)^(0) = 1. But that contradicts the earlier result where for n=2, the product must be -1.\n\nSo perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product is determined by the number of edges in the path, but not in a straightforward way.\n\nWait, perhaps the product of the path is 1 if the path has an even number of edges, and -1 if it has an odd number.\n\nNo, because for the star tree (path length 1), product is -1 (as in n=2), which is odd.\n\nIn the straight line tree for n=4, the path has 3 edges, product is 1 (as computed earlier), which is odd.\n\nHmm, this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product of the path is always 1.\n\nBut that's not the case for the star tree where the path is a single edge. So product is -1.\n\nWait, perhaps the product of the path is equal to the product of all edges in the tree divided by the product of the non-path edges.\n\nBut since the product of the entire tree is 1, and the product of the non-path edges is 1 (since the product of all edges is 1 and the product of the path is 1), then the product of the non-path edges is 1.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nThis seems to be going in circles. Maybe I should try to model the problem differently.\n\nAnother approach: Since each edge is either 1 or -1, and the product constraints must hold, perhaps the function f can be seen as a vector in a space where the constraints define a subspace.\n\nEach constraint is a linear equation over GF(2), as I thought earlier. So the solution space is a vector space over GF(2), and the number of solutions is 2^k, where k is the dimension of the null space.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed with this.\n\nWait, perhaps for any tree, the number of valid f assignments is 2^{n-2}.\n\nBecause the system of equations has n equations, but they are not all independent. For example, the sum of all equations is 0 = n mod 2, which holds when n is even.\n\nSo the rank of the system is n-1. Thus, the solution space has dimension (n-1) - (n-1) + 1 = 1? Not sure.\n\nWait, the number of variables is n-1. The number of equations is n. But the equations are dependent. So the rank is n-1. So the solution space is a coset of a subspace of dimension 1.\n\nThus, for each tree, there are exactly 2 solutions.\n\nWait, that would mean that for each tree, there are 2 valid assignments of f. So the total number of good trees is n^{n-2} * 2^{n-1} / 2^{something} }.\n\nWait, but that's not helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each tree, the number of valid f assignments is 2^{n-2}, since the solution space is 2^{n-2}.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Need to think.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of solutions for a given tree is 2^{n-2}.\n\nBut then, the total number of good trees would be n^{n-2} * 2^{n-1} / 2^{n-2} } = n^{n-2} * 2^{1} } = 2 n^{n-2}.\n\nBut I don't know if that's correct.\n\nBut regardless, perhaps the sum over all good trees can be expressed as the sum over all trees T of (sum over f valid for T of d(1,n)).\n\nSo for each tree T, we can compute the sum of d(1,n) over all f that satisfy the constraints for T, and then sum this over all T.\n\nBut again, this seems difficult.\n\nWait, but perhaps the sum over f for a given tree T can be expressed in terms of the path from 1 to n in T.\n\nLet me think: For a given tree T, the sum of d(1,n) over all valid f for T is equal to the sum over all valid f of (sum of f(e) along the path P from 1 to n in T).\n\nEach edge e can appear in the path of T in some cases. So for each edge e, the number of times it appears in the path across all valid f for T is C_e, and the sum is sum_e C_e * f(e).\n\nBut f(e) is either 1 or -1, and depends on the constraints.\n\nWait, but for a fixed tree T, the constraints fix certain relationships between the edges. So perhaps the sum over f can be determined by considering the structure of T and the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given tree T, the sum over all valid f of d(1,n) is equal to 0.\n\nWait, that's possible. Because for each tree T, perhaps the sum over all valid f is symmetric, leading to cancellation.\n\nBut that's just a hunch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum is equal to (-1)^{something} times the number of valid f.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, let's consider the case when n=2.\n\nThere's only one tree T, with one edge. The valid f is only one: the edge is -1. So the sum is -1.\n\nSo for n=2, the sum is -1.\n\nAnother case: n=4.\n\nIn the straight line tree, the path has 3 edges. The valid f assignments satisfy the product constraints.\n\nEarlier calculation for this tree shows that the product of the path is 1. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given tree T, the sum over all valid f of d(1,n) is equal to the product of the edges in the path, multiplied by the number of valid f assignments.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each tree T, the sum over f is equal to the product of the edges in the path, multiplied by 2^{k}, where k is the number of edges not in the path.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum for a given tree is equal to the product of the edges in the path, multiplied by 2^{(n-1) - m}, where m is the number of edges in the path.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given tree T, the sum over all valid f is equal to the product of the edges in the path multiplied by 2^{(n-2)}.\n\nBut for n=2, that would be (-1) * 2^{0} = -1, which matches.\n\nFor n=4, in the straight line tree, the product of the path is 1, so sum would be 1 * 2^{2} = 4.\n\nBut according to the sample input, when n=4, the sum is -10, which modulo 998244353 is 998244343.\n\nWait, that doesn't match. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think differently.\n\nEach edge can be either +1 or -1. The constraints are that each node's product is -1.\n\nWe can model the problem as finding all possible edge assignments that satisfy these constraints and compute the sum of d(1,n) across all such assignments.\n\nBut the sum is over all possible trees and their valid assignments.\n\nBut perhaps the sum can be broken down into the sum over all trees, and for each tree, the sum over all valid assignments.\n\nSo Sum = sum_{T} sum_{f valid for T} d(1,n).\n\nNow, for a fixed tree T, what is sum_{f valid for T} d(1,n)?\n\nd(1,n) is the sum of f(e) along the path P from 1 to n in T.\n\nSo for each edge e in P, the contribution is f(e).\n\nThe sum over all valid f is the sum over all valid f of (sum_{e in P} f(e)).\n\nThis can be written as sum_{e in P} sum_{f} f(e).\n\nSo for each e in P, sum_{f} f(e) is the number of valid f assignments where e is assigned -1, minus the number where it's +1.\n\nBut how many valid assignments have f(e) = -1 versus +1.\n\nWait, perhaps the constraints for the tree T and edge e may bias the assignment towards certain values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each edge e in P, the sum of f(e) over all valid f is equal to (number of valid f where f(e)=-1) - (number where f(e)=1).\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for",

A tree is considered good if each vertex has an odd number of edges with weight -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Good Trees**: For a tree to be good, each vertex must have an odd number of edges with weight -1. This implies that the product of the weights of edges incident to each vertex is -1.\n2. **System of Equations**: The problem can be modeled using a system of equations where each equation represents the product constraint for a vertex.
