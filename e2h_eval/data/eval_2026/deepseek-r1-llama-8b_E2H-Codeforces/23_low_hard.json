            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles, and I have to find the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form at least one mentsu. A mentsu can be a triplet (three same tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\nHmm, let's break it down. First, I need to process each of the three input strings. Each string represents a tile, like '1s', '2m', etc. So, I'll probably represent each tile as a tuple of (number, suit), which I can convert into integers for easier handling.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Read the input: it's three space-separated strings.\n2. For each tile, extract the number and suit. Maybe create a list of tuples.\n3. Then, for each possible way of adding 0, 1, 2, or maybe more tiles, check if any of the possible sets of four or five tiles (since after drawing, she could have up to six tiles, but she just needs at least one mentsu) contains a mentsu.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no. Because when she draws tiles, she can add any tiles, including those already present. So the initial state is three tiles, and she can add any number of tiles (including zero) to get to four or more. But the goal is to have at least one mentsu in her entire collection after adding those tiles.\n\nBut since the minimal number of tiles to add is what we're seeking, perhaps checking all possibilities of adding 0, 1, 2, etc., until we find the smallest k where with k added tiles, there exists a mentsu.\n\nWait, but considering that the maximum needed is 4 tiles because:\n\n- For a triplet, you can have three same tiles, so even if you have two, adding one more would make it three.\n\n- For a sequence, you might need up to four tiles, but maybe not. For example, if you have two tiles that are part of a sequence, adding the third might complete it.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. Suppose she has three tiles, and none form a mentsu. She can draw one tile, making four. Among these four, is there a subset of three that forms a mentsu?\n\nYes, because a mentsu is any set of three tiles that are either triplet or sequence.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each possible number of additional tiles (k=0, then 1, etc.), check if adding any k tiles (could be any, not necessarily specific ones) will result in having at least one mentsu in the combined set.\n\nWait, but since she can choose any tiles to add, perhaps for each possible k, we can consider all possible combinations of adding k tiles, and see if any of them allows for a mentsu.\n\nBut since the initial tiles are fixed, perhaps it's better to model it as: after adding some tiles, the total set must contain a mentsu.\n\nSo, for each possible way of adding tiles, we need to check whether any possible triplet in the new set is a mentsu.\n\nWait, but how do I model the addition? Because the added tiles can be any, so for each possible number of added tiles (starting from 0 upwards), check if in the union of the initial tiles plus any possible tiles, there exists a mentsu.\n\nBut this seems computationally expensive, especially since the number of possibilities is huge.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of thinking about adding specific tiles, we can model the problem as: for each possible triplet or sequence in any of the suits, determine the minimal number of tiles that need to be added to have at least three tiles matching that triplet or sequence.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the tiles can be from any suit, so perhaps a better approach is to consider all possible triplets and sequences across all suits and see what's the minimal number of tiles needed to form any of them.\n\nWait, but the initial three tiles plus any added tiles can form any of the possible triplets or sequences.\n\nSo, perhaps the plan is:\n\nFor each possible triplet (for all suits and numbers) and for each possible shuntsu (for all suits and sequences of three consecutive numbers), compute the minimal number of tiles needed to form that particular triplet or shuntsu, given the initial three tiles.\n\nThen, the minimal such number across all possible triplets and shuntsu is the answer.\n\nBecause, she can choose to add tiles to form any of these, so the minimal across all possibilities is the solution.\n\nThis makes sense. So the steps are:\n\n1. Enumerate all possible triplets (koutsu) and shuntsu (sequences).\n\n2. For each possible triplet or shuntsu, compute how many tiles are missing from the initial set.\n\n3. The minimal number of tiles needed to add is the minimal",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Mentsu Types**: A mentsu can be either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n2. **Generate All Possible Mentsu**: We will consider all possible triplets and sequences across all suits.\n3. **Check Feasibility for Each Mentsu**: For each possible mentsu, determine how many tiles are missing from the initial set. The minimal number of additional tiles needed to form any mentsu will be our answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    tiles = [tile.strip() for tile in sys.stdin.readline().split()]\n    initial = []\n    for t in tiles:\n        num = int(t[0])\n        suit = t[1]\n        initial.append((num, suit))\n    \n    min_draws = float('inf')\n    \n    # Generate all possible triplets (koutsu)\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        for num in range(1, 10):\n            trip = (num, suit, num, suit, num)\n            count = {}\n            for t in initial + trip[:3]:\n                count[t] = count.get(t, 0) + 1\n            if count[(num, suit)] >= 3:\n                pass\n            else:\n                needed = 3 - count.get((num, suit), 0)\n                if needed < min_draws:\n                    min_draws = needed\n    \n    # Generate all possible shuntsu (sequences)\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        for start in range(1, 8):\n            seq = [(start, suit), (start+1, suit), (start+2, suit)]\n            count_seq = {}\n            for t in initial + seq[:3]:\n                count_seq[t] = count_seq.get(t, 0) + 1\n            for num in range(start, start+3):\n                if count_seq.get((num, suit), 0) < 1:\n                    needed = 3 - count_seq.get((num, suit), 0)\n                    if needed < min_draws:\n                        min_draws = needed\n    \n    print(min_draws)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three strings, each representing a tile. These are parsed into tuples for easier handling.\n2. **Generating Triplets**: For each suit and number, check if adding the necessary tiles can form a triplet.\n3. **Generating Sequences**: For each suit and starting number, check if adding the necessary tiles can form a sequence.\n4. **Determine Minimum Draws**: For each possible mentsu, calculate how many tiles are missing from the initial set and keep track of the minimum number of draws required.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible ways to form a mentsu and determine the minimal number of additional tiles needed.",
