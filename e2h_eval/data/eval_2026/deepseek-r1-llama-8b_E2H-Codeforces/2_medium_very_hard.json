Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. Hmm, let me think about the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, what defines an 'X' in this context? Oh right, the diagonals must all be the same character, and all other squares (not on the diagonals) must be the same different character. Also, n is odd, which means the grid has a clear center.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Read the input correctly. The first line is n, followed by n lines each containing n characters.\n2. Check the diagonals: for both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left), all characters must be the same.\n3. Then, check that all the non-diagonal characters are the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me clarify: the two diagonals must be the same letter, and the rest must be another same letter but not equal to the diagonal's.\n\nSo, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll extract the two diagonals and see if they're consistent.\n\nFor the main diagonal (let's call it diag1), it consists of grid[i][i] for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nFor the anti-diagonal (diag2), it's grid[i][n-1 -i] for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nI need to check if all elements in diag1 are the same character. Similarly for diag2. Also, diag1 and diag2 must be the same character.\n\nOnce that's confirmed, I need to check that all other cells (non-diagonal) are the same character, say c, and c is not equal to the diagonal's character.\n\nBut wait, maybe the diagonals could be different. For example, in a 3x3 grid, if diag1 is 'x' and diag2 is 'x', then the center is part of both. But what if they are different? Like diag1 is 'a' and diag2 is 'b'? Then it's invalid because the X requires both diagonals to be the same.\n\nSo first condition: diag1 must be all same as each other, and diag2 must be all same as each other, and diag1's character equals diag2's.\n\nThen, for all other cells (i,j) where i != j and i + j != n-1, we need to check that they are the same character, and this character is different from the diagonal's.\n\nWait, no. Because the cell (i,j) is on the anti-diagonal if i + j = n-1. So the non-diagonal cells are those where i != j and i + j != n-1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read the grid into a 2D array.\n- Extract the two diagonals.\n- Check if all elements in diag1 are the same, and all in diag2 are same, and diag1_char == diag2_char.\n- Then, collect all the other elements into a list, check if they are all the same, and that this value is different from the diagonal.\n\nWait, but in the case where there are zero other elements? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3 as per the problem statement. So n starts from 3, so there will always be other elements.\n\nWait, no. For n=3, the diagonals include the center cell, and the other cells are the four corners. Wait, no. For n=3, the main diagonal has 3 cells, including the center. The anti-diagonal also has 3 cells, including the center. So the non-diagonal cells are only the four cells where i != j and i + j != n-1.\n\nWait, for n=3, indices are 0,1,2.\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2).\n\nAnti-diagonal: (0,2), (1,1), (2,0).\n\nSo the non-diagonal cells are (0,1), (1,0), (0,1), (1,2), etc.? Wait, no. Wait, for i=0, j=1: i !=j and i+j=1 != 2 (n-1 is 2). So yes, it's non-diagonal.\n\nSo for n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells: (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nWait, no. Let's list all (i,j):\n\n(0,0): main\n(0,1): non\n(0,2): anti\n\n(1,0): non\n(1,1): both\n(1,2): non?\n\nWait, no. For (1,2): i + j = 3, but n is 3, n-1 is 2. So 3 != 2, so yes, (1,2) is non-diagonal.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1): same as above.\n\nSo the four non-diagonal cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nWait, but in n=3, the grid has 9 cells. Diagonals have 3 each, overlapping at the center. So non-diagonal is 9-3-3+1=4 cells? Or perhaps 5? Wait, 3 + 3 -1 (for the center counted twice) =5, so non-diagonal is 9-5=4. Yes.\n\nSo for n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo in any case, for the code, after extracting the diagonals, I need to iterate through all cells, and for each cell not on either diagonal, collect their characters. Then, check if all of them are the same and not equal to the diagonal's character.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line being a string of length n. So the grid is a list of lists or a list of strings.\n\nCheck if all elements in diag1 are the same, and all in diag2 are same, and diag1_char == diag2_char.\n\nIf this is not true, output NO.\n\nElse, collect all the other elements (non-diagonal). If there are none (only possible when n=1?), but n is >=3, so proceed.\n\nCheck if all these elements are the same, and that this value is different from diag_char.\n\nIf all conditions met, output YES. Else, NO.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, read the input.\n\nIn Python, for reading inputs, since the first line is n, but in the sample input it's given as a string with newlines, but probably, each line is a string with '\\n' separators.\n\nWait, the input is given as a list of strings, each representing a row.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe first input is '5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox'\n\nWait, perhaps the first line is 5, followed by 5 lines each representing a row.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nYes.\n\nThen, extract the two diagonals.\n\ndiag1 = []\ndiag2 = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    diag1.append(grid[i][i])\n    diag2.append(grid[i][n-1 -i])\n\nThen, check if all elements in diag1 are the same.\n\ndef all_same(lst):\n    if len(lst) ==0:\n        return True  # but in our case, len is n >=3\n    first = lst[0]\n    for c in lst:\n        if c != first:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nSo, diag1_ok = all_same(diag1)\ndiag2_ok = all_same(diag2)\n\nif not (diag1_ok and diag2_ok):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nThen, check if diag1's character is same as diag2's.\n\ndiag_char = diag1[0]\nif diag_char != diag2[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nThen, collect all the non-diagonal cells.\n\nnon_diag_chars = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i ==j:\n            continue  # on main diagonal\n        if i + j == n-1:\n            continue  # on anti-diagonal\n        non_diag_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen, check if all non_diag_chars are same and not equal to diag_char.\n\nif not non_diag_chars:\n    # impossible since n>=3, but just in case\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    other_char = non_diag_chars[0]\n    if (all(c == other_char for c in non_diag_chars)) and (other_char != diag_char):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but wait: what if non_diag_chars is empty? That would imply that every cell is on the diagonals. But for n>=3, that can't happen because the number of non-diagonal cells is n^2 - 2n +1 = (n-1)^2. For n>=3, that's at least 4.\n\nSo, the code should handle it.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the grid is exactly the X pattern? For example, in the sample input, the second case is a 3x3 grid where the diagonals are 's' and 'w's. Wait, no, the sample input has '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw' as the second input, which is a 3x3 grid.\n\nWait, the first sample input is 5x5, which outputs 'NO'.\n\nSecond sample is 3x3, which is:\n\nw s w\n\ns w s\n\nw s w\n\nWait, no. Wait the input is '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw'. So the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nSo, the diagonals are:\n\ndiag1: grid[0][0] = 'w', grid[1][1] = 'w', grid[2][2] = 'w' → all 'w's.\n\ndiag2: grid[0][2] = 'w', grid[1][1] = 'w', grid[2][0] = 'w' → all 'w's.\n\nSo diag1 and diag2 are same.\n\nThen, the non-diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,1): 's'\n\n(1,0): 's'\n\n(1,2): 's'\n\n(2,1): 's'\n\nSo all non-diagonal are 's', and diag_char is 'w', so 's' != 'w' → valid. So output is YES.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample is 3x3:\n\nx p x\n\np x p\n\nx p x\n\nWait, no, the third sample is '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe'\n\nSo row 0: x p x\n\nrow1: p x p\n\nrow2: x p e\n\nSo diag1 is x, x, e.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for row 0, column 0 is x; row1, column1 is x; row2, column2 is e. So diag1 is x, x, e → not all same. So condition fails, output is NO.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where n=3, all non-diagonal are same, but same as diagonals.\n\nLike:\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\nDiagonals are a and a. Then non-diagonal are a. So other_char is a, same as diag_char. So condition fails → output NO.\n\nAnother case where diagonals are same, but non-diagonal have varying characters.\n\nE.g., n=3:\n\naba\n\nbcb\n\naba\n\nWait, diag1 is a, b, a → not same → output NO.\n\nWait, no. Wait, diag1 is a, b, a. So not same. So code returns NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=5.\n\nCheck that all non-diagonal are same and different from diag.\n\nSo, in code, everything seems covered.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling 0-based vs 1-based indices: since in the code, i and j are 0-based, which is correct.\n\n- Checking all diag1 and diag2: the function all_same correctly checks.\n\n- Collecting all non-diagonal cells: the code correctly skips i=j and i+j = n-1.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the first case is 5x5:\n\nx o o o x\n\no x o o x\n\no x o o x\n\ns o x o o\n\no x o o x\n\nWait, no, the sample input is:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox']\n\nSo, grid[0] is 'xooox' → 'x','o','o','o','x'\n\ngrid[1] is 'oxoxo' → 'o','x','o','x','o'\n\ngrid[2] is 'soxoo' → 's','o','x','o','o'\n\ngrid[3] is 'oxoxo' → 'o','x','o','x','o'\n\ngrid[4] is 'xooox' → 'x','o','o','o','x'\n\nSo, diag1 is grid[0][0] = 'x', grid[1][1] = 'x', grid[2][2] = 'x', grid[3][3] = 'x', grid[4][4] = 'x' → all 'x's.\n\ndiag2 is grid[0][4] = 'x', grid[1][3] = 'x', grid[2][2] = 'x', grid[3][1] = 'x', grid[4][0] = 'x' → all 'x's.\n\nSo diag1 and diag2 are same.\n\nNow, non-diagonal cells:\n\nLet's see.\n\nLoop through each cell.\n\ni=0, j=0 → diag, skip.\n\nj=1: i=0, j=1 → 0+1=1 !=4 (n=5, n-1=4). So include.\n\ncell is 'o'.\n\ni=0, j=2: 0+2=2 !=4 → include. 'o'.\n\nj=3: 0+3=3 !=4 → include. 'o'.\n\nj=4: anti-diagonal, skip.\n\ni=1:\n\nj=0: i!=j, i+j=1 !=4 → include. grid[1][0] = 'o'.\n\nj=1: diag, skip.\n\nj=2: 1+2=3 !=4 → include. grid[1][2] = 'o'.\n\nj=3: anti-diagonal, 1+3=4 → skip.\n\nj=4: grid[1][4] = 'o'.\n\ni=2:\n\nj=0: 2+0=2 !=4 → include. grid[2][0] = 's'.\n\nj=1: 2+1=3 !=4 → include. grid[2][1] = 'o'.\n\nj=2: diag, skip.\n\nj=3: 2+3=5 !=4 → include. grid[2][3] = 'o'.\n\nj=4: anti-diagonal, skip.\n\ni=3:\n\nj=0: 3+0=3 !=4 → include. grid[3][0] = 'o'.\n\nj=1: 3+1=4 → anti-diagonal, skip.\n\nj=2: 3+2=5 → include. grid[3][2] = 'o'.\n\nj=3: diag, skip.\n\nj=4: anti-diagonal, skip.\n\ni=4:\n\nj=0: 4+0=4 → anti-diagonal, skip.\n\nj=1: 4+1=5 → include. grid[4][1] = 'o'.\n\nj=2: 4+2=6 → include. grid[4][2] = 'o'.\n\nj=3: 4+3=7 → include. grid[4][3] = 'o'.\n\nj=4: diag, skip.\n\nSo, the non-diagonal cells include:\n\nFrom i=0: j=1,2,3 → 'o','o','o'\n\ni=1: j=0,2,4 → 'o','o','o'\n\ni=2: j=0,1,3 → 's','o','o'\n\ni=3: j=0,2 → 'o','o'\n\ni=4: j=1,2,3 → 'o','o','o'\n\nSo the collected non_diag_chars are ['o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o', 's', 'o', 'o', 'o', 'o'].\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me recount.\n\nWait, for each cell:\n\ni=0: j=1,2,3 → 3 cells: o, o, o.\n\ni=1: j=0,2,4 → 3 cells: o, o, o.\n\ni=2: j=0,1,3 → 3 cells: s, o, o.\n\ni=3: j=0,2 → 2 cells: o, o.\n\ni=4: j=1,2,3 → 3 cells: o, o, o.\n\nTotal: 3+3+3+2+3=14 cells.\n\nWait, but for n=5, the number of non-diagonal cells is (5-1)* (5-1) =16? Or wait, the formula is (n-1)^2. For n=5, 16 cells.\n\nHmm, but in the code, for n=5, the loop runs 25 times, and for each cell, skips if on either diagonal.\n\nSo the non_diag_chars should have 16 elements.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, for n=5, the number of non-diagonal cells is:\n\nTotal cells: 25.\n\nNumber of cells on main diagonal: 5.\n\nNumber on anti-diagonal:5.\n\nBut the center cell (2,2) is on both diagonals. So total unique cells on diagonals: 5 +5 -1 =9.\n\nThus, non-diagonal: 25-9=16.\n\nSo, the non_diag_chars should have 16 elements.\n\nIn the sample input for n=5, the non-diagonal cells are all 'o's except for cell (2,0) which is 's'. So the non_diag_chars list contains one 's' and the rest 'o's.\n\nSo, in that case, the code will find that non_diag_chars has some elements not same, thus outputting NO.\n\nWhich is correct, as the sample shows.\n\nSo, the code handles that.\n\nAnother test case: n=3.\n\nAll non-diagonal are same as each other and different from the diagonals.\n\nYes, the sample passes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, time to write the code.\n\nBut wait, in the code, when we read the grid, each line is a string. So grid[i][j] is accessible as such.\n\nImplementing all_same function.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid.\n\nExtract diag1 and diag2.\n\nCheck if all diag1 and diag2 are same, and diag1_char == diag2_char.\n\nCollect non-diagonal chars.\n\nCheck if they are all same and different from diag_char.\n\nOutput YES or NO accordingly.\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndef all_same(lst):\n    if not lst:\n        return True\n    first = lst[0]\n    for c in lst:\n        if c != first:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndiag1 = []\ndiag2 = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    diag1.append(grid[i][i])\n    diag2.append(grid[i][n-1 - i])\n\nif not (all_same(diag1) and all_same(diag2)):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif diag1[0] != diag2[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nnon_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j:\n            continue\n        if i + j == n - 1:\n            continue\n        non_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif not non_diag:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    other = non_diag[0]\n    if all(c == other for c in non_diag) and other != diag1[0]:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n",
