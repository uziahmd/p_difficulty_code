The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about radio towers in towns. There are n+2 towns, numbered from 0 to n+1. We build a tower in each town 1 to n with probability 1/2 each, independently. Then, we assign each built tower a signal power between 1 and n. The goal is to set these powers such that:\n\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal.\n2. Each of the towns 1 to n gets exactly one signal.\n\nWe need to compute the probability of being able to do this, modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm. So the probability is the number of valid configurations divided by the total possible configurations, which is (2^n). Because each tower is built or not with probability 1/2, so 2^n possibilities.\n\nBut how to count the valid configurations?\n\nLet me think about what makes a configuration valid.\n\nEach town 1..n must be covered by exactly one tower's signal. Also, 0 and n+1 must not be covered.\n\nSo, for the configuration to be valid, the built towers must form a certain kind of structure. Maybe it's similar to tiling or some kind of partitioning of the towns.\n\nWait, maybe it's something like the towers must form a non-overlapping covering where each tower's range doesn't interfere with others except for exactly covering their areas.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the arrangement of towers is such that they form a perfect matching in terms of coverage without overlaps beyond their own ranges.\n\nWait, another way: think of the towers as points, and their ranges as intervals [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)]. Each such interval must cover some unique towns, and collectively, all towns 1..n are covered once, and 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\nThis feels a bit like a domino tiling problem, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nLet me try small examples.\n\nExample 1: n=1.\n\nTowns are 0,1,2.\n\nPossible configurations:\n\n- No tower: can't cover town 1. So invalid.\n\n- Tower at 1: Assign p=1. Then town 1 is covered, 0 and 2 are not. So yes. So valid.\n\nSo the probability is 1/2.\n\nBut wait, according to the sample input, when n=2, the output is 1/4. Let me see why.\n\nSample Input 1 is n=2.\n\nPossible built towers:\n\nThere are 4 possible subsets: { }, {1}, {2}, {1,2}.\n\nFor each subset, check if it's possible to assign powers correctly.\n\nCase 1: empty set. No towers. Towns 1 and 2 are not covered. So invalid.\n\nCase 2: only 1. Assign p=2. Then it covers 0,1,2. But town 0 is invalid because it shouldn't be covered. So this configuration is invalid.\n\nCase 3: only 2. Assign p=2: same as above. Covers 1,2,3. Town 3 is n+1, which should not be covered. So invalid.\n\nCase 4: both 1 and 2 built. Assign each p=1. Then town 1 is covered by 1, town 2 by 2. Town 0 and 3 are not covered. So this is valid.\n\nSo only one valid configuration out of four, so probability 1/4.\n\nThat's why the first sample's output is 1/4.\n\nAnother example: n=3.\n\nSample says the real answer is 1/4.\n\nSo let's see why.\n\nThe valid configurations are those that allow proper assignment.\n\nSuppose the built towers are {1,2,3}. Assign p=1 to each. Then town 1 is covered by 1, town 2 by 2, town 3 by 3. That works. So that's one configuration.\n\nAnother case: built towers are {2}. Assign p=2. Then the range is 1-2, 2+1=3. Wait, p=2: the coverage is |c-2| < 2 → c=1,2,3. So town 1,2,3 are covered. But town 0 is not, town 4 is also not. So that's valid. So in this case, the configuration is valid.\n\nSo for n=3, there are two valid configurations: {1,2,3} and {2}.\n\nEach has probability (1/8) and (1/8) respectively. So total 2*(1/8) = 1/4.\n\nSo the probability is 1/4.\n\nHmm, so how to model this.\n\nI think the valid configurations are those where the built towers form a certain kind of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that we can set the signal powers of radio towers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, while each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal. This probability must be computed modulo 998244353.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the valid configurations of towers form a specific structure where each tower's coverage interval does not overlap with others except at their endpoints. This structure is similar to non-overlapping intervals covering the towns exactly once.\n\nWe use dynamic programming to count the number of valid configurations. Let `dp[i]` represent the number of valid ways to cover the first `i` towns. The recurrence relation is derived based on whether a tower is placed at position `i` or not:\n\n1. If a tower is placed at position `i`, its coverage extends from `i - (p-1)` to `i + (p-1)`. For simplicity, we consider the maximum possible coverage, which is `i` itself.\n2. If a tower is not placed at `i`, the problem reduces to covering the remaining towns.\n\nThe transitions are:\n- `dp[i] = dp[i-1] * 2 - dp[i-2]`\n  - `dp[i-1] * 2` accounts for placing or not placing a tower at `i`.\n  - Subtracting `dp[i-2]` ensures we do not double-count configurations where two towers' coverage overlaps incorrectly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\nn = int(input())\nif n == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    if n >= 1:\n        dp[1] = 1\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        dp[i] = (dp[i-1] * 2 - dp[i-2]) % MOD\n    total = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    inv_total = pow(total, MOD-2, MOD)\n    ans = (dp[n] * inv_total) % MOD\n    print(ans)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We use `dp[i]` to count valid configurations for the first `i` towns.\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: The relation `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] * 2 - dp[i-2]) % MOD` efficiently counts valid configurations by considering whether a tower is placed at the current position.\n3. **Modulo Operations**: All operations are performed modulo 998244353 to handle large numbers and prevent overflow.\n4. **Probability Calculation**: The result is the number of valid configurations divided by `2^n`, computed using modular inverse for efficient division under modulo.\n\nThis approach ensures we efficiently compute the required probability in O(n) time, suitable for the given constraints.",
