Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. First, I need to understand what happens when we remove each element. For each element, I can compute what the new max and min would be if I remove it, then calculate the instability for that scenario. But wait, n can be up to 1e5, so doing this naively for each element by checking all others is O(n^2), which won't work. That's way too slow.\n\nSo I need a smarter way. Maybe I can precompute some information about the array to quickly determine the max and min when any element is removed.\n\nWait, but how? Because removing an element could affect both the max and min. Like, if the element I'm removing is the current max, then the new max will be the second max. Similarly for the min.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should sort the array. Once the array is sorted, I can easily find the next max or min when an element is removed.\n\nLet me think: After sorting, the first element is the min, and the last is the max. So for each position i (from 0 to n-1), if I remove a[i], the new min would be a[0] if i is not 0, else a[1]. Similarly, the new max would be a[-1] if i is not the last element, else a[-2].\n\nBut wait, that's only true if the array has duplicates or multiple instances of the same value. For example, if the array is [1, 3, 3, 7], removing the 7 gives a new max of 3, which is correct. But what if the array is [1, 2, 4, 7], and I remove 4? The new max is 7, and min is 1, so instability is 6. But if I remove 7, the new max is 4, and min remains 1. Instability is 3.\n\nWait, but according to the sample input, when you remove 7 from [1,3,3,7], the instability becomes 3-1=2. So yes, the sorted approach seems to work here.\n\nSo the idea is:\n\n1. Sort the array.\n2. For each i in 0..n-1:\n   a. If i is 0: the new min is a[1], else min is a[0].\n   b. If i is n-1: the new max is a[n-2], else max is a[n-1].\n   c. The current instability is max - min.\n3. Find the minimum instability across all i.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because once the array is sorted, removing any element can only change the max or min if it was the current max or min.\n\nWait, but what if the array has multiple elements equal to the max or min? Like [1,1,2,3,3]. If I remove one of the 1s, the new min is still 1. If I remove a 3, the new max is 2.\n\nSo, in the sorted array, for any i, the new min is the minimum of the remaining elements. Since the array is sorted, if i is 0, then removing it would make the min a[1], else it remains a[0]. Similarly for the max.\n\nTherefore, the plan is solid. Let's outline the steps:\n\n- Sort the array.\n- Compute for each possible i, the new min and max after removing a[i].\n- Calculate the instability for each case and track the minimum.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nFirst, read n and the array. Then sort it.\n\nThen, for each i in range(n):\n\nIf i == 0:\n   new_min = a[1]\nElse:\n   new_min = a[0]\n\nIf i == n-1:\n   new_max = a[n-2]\nElse:\n   new_max = a[n-1]\n\ncurrent_instability = new_max - new_min\n\nWe compute this for each i and keep track of the minimum.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because sometimes, even if i is not 0, the new min might not just be a[0]. For example, consider [1,2,3,4,5], and i=1 (element 2). The new min is 1, same as a[0]. So that works.\n\nAnother example: [1,1,2,3]. If I remove the first 1, the new min is 1 (the second 1). So yes, that approach works.\n\nSo the initial idea is correct.\n\nBut wait, another test case: [1,3,3",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps us easily determine the new maximum and minimum values when any element is removed.\n2. **Iterate Through Each Element**: For each element, consider it as the one being removed and compute the instability of the resulting array.\n3. **Compute New Min and Max**: If the element being removed is the first or last element in the sorted array, adjust the new min or max accordingly. Otherwise, the new min and max remain unchanged.\n4. **Track Minimum Instability**: For each removal, calculate the instability and keep track of the minimum value encountered.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum instability by leveraging the properties of a sorted array, allowing us to avoid an O(n^2) complexity and instead achieve an O(n log n) complexity due to sorting.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmin_instability = float('inf')\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if i == 0:\n        current_min = a[1]\n    else:\n        current_min = a[0]\n    \n    if i == n-1:\n        current_max = a[-2]\n    else:\n        current_max = a[-1]\n    \n    instability = current_max - current_min\n    if instability < min_instability:\n        min_instability = instability\n\nprint(min_instability)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n2. **Loop Through Elements**: For each element, we check if it's the first or last element and adjust the new minimum or maximum accordingly.\n3. **Calculate Instability**: For each scenario, compute the instability as the difference between the new maximum and minimum values.\n4. **Track Minimum**: Keep updating the minimum instability found during each iteration.\n\nThis method ensures that we efficiently find the optimal element to remove to achieve the lowest possible instability, making use of sorting and linear iteration to maintain an optimal time complexity.",
