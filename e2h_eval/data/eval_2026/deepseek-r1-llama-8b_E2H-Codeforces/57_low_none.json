His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about an Olympiad where participants' results from two tours are given. But the problem is that the teacher only has the points for each tour, not which participant got which. The teacher knows that Vasya's total (sum of his two scores) is at least x. We need to find the best and worst possible places Vasya could have gotten.\n\nHmm. So, the key here is to figure out all possible ways to pair the a_i and b_j such that one participant gets a_i and another gets b_j. Then, for each possible pairing, we can compute the sum of each participant's points, sort them, and determine Vasya's rank based on his sum.\n\nWait, but n is up to 105, so trying all possible pairings is computationally infeasible. Because for each of the n participants, we'd have to assign a unique a and b value, but since both lists have n elements each, it's like assigning a permutation of a's and b's.\n\nWait, no. Because for each participant, their a score and b score are fixed as per the input. Or wait, no: the input gives a1, a2,... an as the first tour points, and similarly for the second tour. But the problem says that the results are given in arbitrary order. So, to correctly model this, each participant's total is a permutation of a's paired with a permutation of b's. Wait, no. Each participant's a and b are a specific pair, but since the lists are given in arbitrary order, we don't know which a corresponds to which participant. So, the way to model this is that for each participant, their a and b are some a_i and b_j, but each a and b can be used exactly once.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the a list and b list as being shuffled. So, the total points for each participant is a_i + b_j, but each a_i is used exactly once, and same for each b_j.\n\nSo, the process is: assign each a_i to a participant, and each b_j to a participant, such that each participant has exactly one a and one b, and all are used.\n\nOnce we have all possible assignments, we can compute for each participant their sum, then sort them in descending order, and find Vasya's position.\n\nBut wait, how do we determine which assignment includes Vasya? Because Vasya is one of the participants, so in the assignment, he must have a sum >= x.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. For all possible permutations of a and b, pair each a_i with a b_j in a way that each is used exactly once.\n\n2. For each such pairing, compute all the participants' sums.\n\n3. Sort these sums in non-increasing order.\n\n4. Find the position of Vasya's sum in this sorted list. The minimum possible position (best place) is when his sum is as high as possible, and others are higher or equal. The maximum possible position (worst place) is when his sum is as low as possible, and others are higher or equal.\n\nBut considering that n is up to 105, enumerating all possible permutations is impossible because the number of permutations is n! which is way too big.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, we need a smarter way to compute the best and worst possible ranks without enumerating all possibilities.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. The best possible rank occurs when Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and as many other participants as possible have lower sums than his. To maximize his rank, we want to minimize the number of participants with higher sums than his.\n\nWait, no. The best possible rank is 1 if there exists a way to arrange the a and b such that Vasya's sum is the highest. Otherwise, it's the next possible. So, the best case is when Vasya's sum is as high as possible.\n\nSimilarly, the worst possible rank is when Vasya's sum is as low as possible, with as many participants having higher sums as possible.\n\nSo, perhaps to find the best possible rank, we can try to maximize Vasya's sum, and arrange the rest of the participants' sums such that as few as possible are higher than his.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the best possible rank is determined by the maximum possible sum Vasya can have, given that the sum is at least x. Because if Vasya's sum is as high as possible, then it's more likely that others have lower sums, giving him a better rank.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because even if Vasya's sum is high, others might also have high sums, depending on the pairing.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take:\n\n- Determine all possible pairs for Vasya, ensuring that",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The results of the tours are given as lists of points, but without knowing which participant got which points. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We are given two lists of points for each participant in two tours. Each participant's total points are the sum of their points from both tours. The goal is to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve, given that his total points are at least `x`.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: To find the best rank, we need to maximize Vasya's total points while ensuring others' points are as low as possible. Conversely, to find the worst rank, we minimize Vasya's total points while others' points are as high as possible.\n\n3. **Optimal Pairing**:\n   - **Best Rank**: Pair each participant's points such that Vasya's points are maximized. This is done by sorting the first tour points in ascending order and the second tour points in descending order, then pairing them.\n   - **Worst Rank**: Pair each participant's points such that Vasya's points are minimized. This is done by sorting both tour points in ascending order and pairing them.\n\n4. **Sorting and Counting**: After determining Vasya's points for both scenarios, sort all participants' total points in descending order. The position of Vasya's points in this sorted list gives his rank.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    # Best case: Vasya has the maximum possible sum\n    a_sorted_asc = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted_desc = sorted(b, reverse=True)\n    best_sum_vasya = max(a) + max(b)\n    if best_sum_vasya < x:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n    best_sums = []\n    for ai, bi in zip(a_sorted_asc, b_sorted_desc):\n        best_sums.append(ai + bi)\n    best_sums.sort(reverse=True)\n    best_rank = 1\n    for i, s in enumerate(best_sums):\n        if s < best_sum_vasya:\n            break\n        best_rank = i + 1\n    \n    # Worst case: Vasya has the minimum possible sum (at least x)\n    a_sorted_asc = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted_asc = sorted(b)\n    min_possible = None\n    for ai, bi in zip(a_sorted_asc, b_sorted_asc):\n        current_sum = ai + bi\n        if min_possible is None or current_sum < min_possible:\n            min_possible = current_sum\n    if min_possible < x:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n    worst_sums = []\n    for ai, bi in zip(a_sorted_asc, b_sorted_asc):\n        worst_sums.append(ai + bi)\n    worst_sums.sort(reverse=True)\n    worst_rank = 1\n    for i, s in enumerate(worst_sums):\n        if s < min_possible:\n            break\n        worst_rank = i + 1\n    \n    print(f\"{best_rank} {worst_rank}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Best Rank Calculation**: By sorting the first tour points in ascending order and the second tour points in descending order, we maximize Vasya's points while minimizing others'. This ensures Vasya's rank is as high as possible.\n- **Worst Rank Calculation**: By sorting both tours' points in ascending order, we minimize Vasya's points while maximizing others', ensuring his rank is as low as possible.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the best and worst ranks without enumerating all permutations, making it computationally feasible for the given constraints.",
