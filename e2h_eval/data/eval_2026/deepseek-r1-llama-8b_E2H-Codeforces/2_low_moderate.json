Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. Hmm, let me think about the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, what defines an 'X' in this context? Oh right, the diagonals must all be the same character, and all other squares (not on the diagonals) must be the same different character. Also, n is odd, which means the grid has a clear center.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Read the input correctly. The first line is n, followed by n lines each containing n characters.\n2. Check the diagonals: for both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left), all characters must be the same.\n3. Then, check that all the non-diagonal characters are the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me clarify: the two diagonals must be the same letter, and the rest must be another same letter but not equal to the diagonal's.\n\nSo, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll extract the two diagonals and see if they're consistent.\n\nFor the main diagonal (let's call it diag1), it consists of grid[i][i] for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nFor the anti-diagonal (diag2), it's grid[i][n-1 -i] for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nI need to check if all elements in diag1 are the same character. Similarly for diag2. Also, diag1 and diag2 must be the same character.\n\nOnce that's confirmed, I need to check that all other cells (non-diagonal) are the same character, say c, and c is not equal to the diagonal's character.\n\nSo, how do I approach this?\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n- Read the grid into a 2D list. Since the input is given as a string per row, each row can be processed into a list of characters.\n\n- Check the two diagonals:\n   a. For diag1, iterate through each position (i,i) and collect the characters. Check if all are the same.\n   b. Do the same for diag2.\n   c. If diag1 and diag2 are not the same, then it's not an X. Return NO.\n   d. Also, if either diag has varying characters, it's NO.\n\n- Now, assuming the two diagonals are the same (call this char d), check the rest of the grid.\n   a. For each cell (i,j) where i != j and i + j != n-1, collect the character.\n   b. All these collected characters must be the same, and they must not be equal to d.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nWell, n=3 is the smallest case. For example, the sample input had a 3x3 grid that was a proper X.\n\nAnother case: when the diagonals are correct but the surrounding characters are mixed.\n\nAlso, ensure that the code handles grids of various sizes up to 299.\n\nNow, thinking about the implementation:\n\nIn Python, read n, then read n lines. Each line can be stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace (though the problem says each line is exactly n letters).\n\nBut wait, sometimes when pasting inputs, extra newlines might be present, but the problem statement says that each of the next n lines contains n letters. So each line should be exactly length n, with no trailing newline or spaces.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    grid.append(list(line))\n\nThen, process the diagonals.\n\nCheck diag1:\n\nd1 = None\nfor i in range(n):\n    if d1 is None:\n        d1 = grid[i][i]\n    else:\n        if grid[i][i] != d1:\n            # Diag1 has different characters\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n\nSimilarly for diag2:\n\nd2 = None\nfor i in range(n):\n    if d2 is None:\n        d2 = grid[i][n-1 - i]\n    else:\n        if grid[i][n-1 -i] != d2:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n\nIf d1 != d2, then it's not an X.\n\nif d1 != d2:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow, check the non-diagonal cells.\n\nexpected_char = None\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if (i == j) or (i + j == n-1):\n            continue\n        current_char = grid[i][j]\n        if expected_char is None:\n            expected_char = current_char\n       ",
