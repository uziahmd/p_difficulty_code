The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Xenia is trying to complete her tasks by moving around a ringroad. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem statement says that Xenia lives in a city with n houses arranged in a ring. The traffic is one-way and clockwise. She starts at house 1 and has m tasks. For each task i, she needs to be at house a_i. But not just that—she has to complete all tasks with numbers less than i. So, for example, if her tasks are [3, 2, 3], then she must be at 3 after the first task, then at 2 after the second, and then at 3 again after the third. Wait, no—wait, let me rephrase: she must complete all tasks numbered less than i before doing task i. So the order of the tasks is fixed as given. So for each i from 1 to m, she has to reach a_i, but only after completing all previous tasks (those with j < i).\n\nSo the goal is to find the minimal time she needs to spend moving along the ring to complete all these tasks in order.\n\nHmm. How do we model this? Let's think about the movement.\n\nShe starts at house 1. Then, for each task in the order given, she has to move to the required house, but also considering that she might have to visit other houses along the way for earlier tasks.\n\nWait, but the order is fixed. So for each task i, she must have already completed all j < i. So for each i, the position she is in after handling task j < i must get her to a_i in some way, possibly with minimal steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal path is determined by the positions of the a_i's in the ring.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tasks. Since the ring is circular, the distance between two houses can be computed in two directions: clockwise and counter-clockwise. But since the traffic is one-way clockwise, movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction. So when moving from a house to another, you can only go clockwise.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the ring is one-way and clockwise. So the ring is like a loop where each house points to the next in the clockwise direction. So Xenia can only move to higher-numbered houses in a circular fashion. Wait, but the numbering is from 1 to n in clockwise order. So house 1 is connected to house 2 and house n. Because it's a ring.\n\nWait, no. In a ring, each house is connected to its next and previous in the clockwise direction. So house 1 is connected to 2 and n. House 2 is connected to 3 and 1, etc. So movement can be either to the next or the previous house, but since the traffic is one-way clockwise, she can only move in the clockwise direction. Or wait, does the one-way mean that the ring allows only movement in the clockwise direction, i.e., from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, ..., n-1 to n, n to 1? No, that doesn't make sense because that would form a cycle but in a single direction. Wait, maybe the ring is set up such that each house can only move to the next one in the clockwise direction, but to return to the start, you have to go through all houses.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nThe ring is a circular arrangement. Traffic is one-way and clockwise. So, for example, if the ring has 4 houses: 1→2→3→4→1. So from house 1, she can only move to 2. From 2 to 3, and so on, and from 4 back to 1.\n\nWait, no. Because in a ring, each node has exactly two edges: one incoming and one outgoing. But if the ring is one-way, perhaps each node can only send traffic in one direction. So for a ring of 4 nodes, 1→2→3→4→1. So she can only move in the direction 1→2→3→4→1. So, she cannot move from 2 to 1, because that's against the one-way direction.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So movement is only possible in the clockwise direction, meaning that from any house, the next is the next higher number, wrapping around to 1 after n.\n\nSo, for example, house 4's next is 1, and previous is 3. But since the traffic is one-way clockwise, she can only move from 3→4, 4→1, 1→2, 2→3.\n\nWait, no. Because the ring is a cycle, but the one-way implies that she can't move backward. So, she can only move in the direction of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a one-way ring road. The key is to find the optimal path that minimizes the total time spent moving between houses.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Ring Road**: The ring road is circular with `n` houses numbered from 1 to n in a clockwise direction. Xenia can only move clockwise, meaning she can only go from house `i` to house `i+1` (or wrap around to 1 after `n`).\n\n2. **Task Completion Order**: Xenia has `m` tasks, each requiring her to be at a specific house `a_i`. She must complete all tasks in the given order, meaning she must reach each `a_i` in sequence.\n\n3. **Optimal Path Calculation**: For each task, calculate the minimal distance needed to reach the required house from her current position. The distance is computed in the clockwise direction since that's the only allowed direction.\n\n4. **Cumulative Time Calculation**: Sum up the distances for all tasks to get the total time required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent_pos = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor i in range(m):\n    target = tasks[i]\n    # Calculate the minimal steps to reach target from current_pos\n    # Moving clockwise\n    if current_pos <= target:\n        steps = target - current_pos\n    else:\n        steps = (n - current_pos) + target\n    total_time += steps\n    current_pos = target\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with zero time.\n- **Iterate Through Tasks**: For each task, determine the shortest path from the current position to the target house in a clockwise direction.\n- **Distance Calculation**: If the target is ahead of the current position, move directly. If it's behind, wrap around the ring and compute the distance accordingly.\n- **Update Position and Time**: After reaching the target, update the current position and add the distance to the total time.\n- **Output Result**: Print the total time after completing all tasks.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimal time required by leveraging the properties of the ring road and the constraints of movement direction.",
