    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it step by step. \n\nThe problem is about counting certain edge-weighted trees and summing a specific value over all of them. Let's try to understand the problem statement carefully.\n\nWe have a tree with n vertices, each edge is either 1 or -1. The tree is called \"good\" if for every vertex i, the product of the weights of all edges incident to i is -1. So for each node, the product of its adjacent edges must be -1. Interesting condition.\n\nOur task is to compute the sum of d(1, n) across all such good trees. d(1, n) is the sum of the edge weights along the unique path from 1 to n. Since each edge is either 1 or -1, the path sum can vary. But since we're summing over all possible good trees, we need an efficient way to calculate this without enumerating all possibilities, which is impossible for large n.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tree. Since it's a tree, there's exactly one path between any two nodes. For each node i, the product of the edges around it is -1. This seems like a parity condition on the edges connected to i.\n\nWait, let's model this. Each edge has a weight of ±1. For each node i, the product of the edges incident to it is -1. So for node 1, the product of all edges in its adjacent edges must be -1. Similarly for node n, the same applies.\n\nHmm. Let's think about what this implies for the tree structure. Maybe the tree has certain properties, like being a star or something else. Or perhaps the root plays a role here.\n\nWait, maybe the tree is a chain. No, because in that case, the endpoints would have only one edge each. But in a chain of length m (n nodes), the endpoints have degree 1, so their product is just the weight of that single edge. So for the tree to be good, the endpoints must have product -1. That means each endpoint has an edge of weight -1. So in a chain, that's possible.\n\nBut wait, for other nodes in the chain, their product would be the product of two edges. So for example, the second node has edges to the first and third. The product is edge1 * edge2. This product must be -1. So edge1 * edge2 = -1. So edge2 is the negative of edge1.\n\nSo in a chain of three nodes, 1-2-3: the edges are 1-2 (w1) and 2-3 (w2). For node 2, w1 * w2 = -1. So w2 = -w1. Also, for node 1, w1 must be -1, and for node 3, w2 must be -1. Wait, no: node 3's product is just w2, so it must be -1. So w2 is -1. Then w1 * w2 = (-1)*(-1) = 1, which is not equal to -1. So that's a problem. So the chain of three nodes can't be a good tree? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, wait. Let's take n=3. The tree is a chain. The conditions are:\n\n- For node 1: the edge to 2 is w1. Product is w1 = -1.\n- For node 2: edges to 1 (w1) and 3 (w2). Their product is w1*w2 = -1.\n- For node 3: edge to 2 is w2. Product is w2 = -1.\n\nSo from node 1: w1 = -1.\n\nFrom node 3: w2 = -1.\n\nThen, node 2's product is (-1)*(-1) = 1, which is not -1. So this doesn't satisfy the condition. So a chain of three nodes cannot be a good tree.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So the tree can't be a chain for n >=3, perhaps. Or maybe for some other structures.\n\nWait, maybe the tree is a star, where node 1 is connected to all others. Let's see for n=4.\n\nIn this case, node 1 has three edges: each to 2, 3, 4. The product of these three edges must be -1.\n\nEach leaf node (2,3,4) has only one edge, so their product is just that edge's weight, which must be -1. So edges 1-2, 1-3, 1-4 must each be -1.\n\nWait, but then the product for node 1 is (-1)^3 = -1, which satisfies the condition. So yes, for n=4, the star-shaped tree where all edges are -1 is a good tree.\n\nSo the star structure can be a good tree for certain n.\n\nSo perhaps the general approach is to find all possible trees that meet the condition and then compute the sum of d(1,n) for each.\n\nBut considering the number of possible trees is huge, we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. For each node, the product of edges incident to it is -1.\n\nThis implies that each node has an odd number of edges with weight -1. Because the product is -1, which is negative. So the count of -1 edges around a node must be odd.\n\nWait, because the product of an even number of -1s is 1, and an odd number is -1. So each node has an odd number of edges with weight -1.\n\nSo each node must have an odd degree in terms of the number of edges with weight -1.\n\nBut wait, each edge contributes to two nodes. So for the entire tree, the sum of the degrees (in terms of the -1 edges) is twice the number of -1 edges in the tree.\n\nBut each node contributes an odd degree. So the sum of all nodes' degrees is the sum of n numbers, each odd. So the total sum is n mod 2. Because sum of n odds is n mod 2.\n\nBut 2 * (number of -1 edges) must be congruent to n mod 2. So 2k ≡ n mod 2 → 0 ≡ n mod 2. So n must be even. Otherwise, there are no good trees.\n\nWait, that's a big point. So if n is odd, then the sum of all node degrees (each being odd) is n, which is odd. But the sum is also 2k (even). So 2k can't be odd. Therefore, for odd n, there are zero good trees. So for n=1, since there's no edges, the condition is trivially satisfied. But for n>1 and odd, no good trees exist.\n\nWait, let's test n=1. n=1, the tree has no edges. So for each node (only node 1), the product is 1 (empty product). But the condition requires the product to be -1. So n=1 is not a good tree. So for n=1, the answer is 0.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the problem statement. The definition says for each vertex i, the product of the edge weights incident to i is -1. So for n=1, there are zero edges. The product is 1, which is not -1. So n=1 cannot be a good tree.\n\nSo in code, for n=1, the answer is 0.\n\nFor n=2, the tree is a single edge. So the product for node 1 is w, product for node 2 is w. So both must be -1. So w must be -1. So the only possible tree is the one with edge -1. So the sum is -1, which modulo 998244353 is 998244352.\n\nWhich matches the sample input.\n\nSo for n=2, the answer is 998244352.\n\nNow, for n even, say n=4. We saw that the star-shaped tree is possible, but maybe other structures as well.\n\nWait, but earlier for n=3, the chain didn't work. So perhaps the only possible good trees are stars where all edges are -1, except for when n=2.\n\nNo, that can't be right because for n=4, the star is a valid solution, but perhaps there are other solutions as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only possible good trees are those where the root has all edges as -1, and the rest form a tree that meets the condition recursively.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure. Let's think differently.\n\nLet me consider the problem in terms of linear algebra. Each node's condition imposes a constraint on the edges. Each edge is a variable that can be +1 or -1. So for each node i, the product of edges incident to it is -1. So for each node, we have an equation: product(edges) = -1.\n\nThese equations must be satisfied simultaneously.\n\nBut how many variables and equations do we have? For a tree with n nodes, there are n-1 edges. So n-1 variables. And n equations. So unless the equations are dependent, the system may not have a solution.\n\nWait, for n=2, we have 1 variable (the edge between 1 and 2) and 2 equations: w = -1 for both nodes. So that's consistent.\n\nFor n=3, 2 variables, 3 equations. The equations are:\n\nnode 1: e1 = -1\n\nnode 2: e1 * e2 = -1\n\nnode 3: e2 = -1\n\nSo substituting e1 = -1 and e2 = -1 into the second equation gives (-1)*(-1) = 1 ≠ -1. So no solution. Hence, no good trees for n=3.\n\nSimilarly, for n=4, let's see:\n\nVariables: e1 (1-2), e2 (1-3), e3 (1-4).\n\nEquations:\n\nnode1: e1*e2*e3 = -1\n\nnode2: e1 = -1\n\nnode3: e2 = -1\n\nnode4: e3 = -1\n\nSo substituting e1=-1, e2=-1, e3=-1 into node1's equation:\n\n(-1)*(-1)*(-1) = -1 → -1 = -1, which holds. So this is a solution.\n\nSo the star-shaped tree with all edges as -1 is a solution. Are there other solutions?\n\nSuppose another tree structure, like a chain: 1-2-3-4.\n\nEdges are e1 (1-2), e2 (2-3), e3 (3-4).\n\nEquations:\n\nnode1: e1 = -1\n\nnode2: e1 * e2 = -1 → since e1 = -1, e2 must be 1.\n\nnode3: e2 * e3 = -1 → e2=1 → e3 = -1.\n\nnode4: e3 = -1 → which is okay.\n\nSo now, let's check node 1's condition: e1 = -1 → product is -1. Good.\n\nNode2: e1 * e2 = (-1)(1) = -1. Good.\n\nNode3: e2 * e3 = 1*(-1) = -1. Good.\n\nNode4: e3 = -1. Good.\n\nSo this is another good tree. So for n=4, there are at least two good trees: the star and the chain.\n\nHmm, that complicates things. So the previous approach of only considering the star isn't sufficient.\n\nSo what's the pattern here? How can we model the problem to find the sum efficiently?\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps model the problem using XOR-like properties or parity considerations.\n\nWait, the product condition is equivalent to saying that for each node i, the number of -1 edges incident to it is odd.\n\nBecause the product of an even number of -1s is 1, and odd is -1. So for each node, the count of -1 edges is odd.\n\nSo each node has an odd number of -1 edges.\n\nSince each edge contributes to two nodes, the sum of all nodes' counts of -1 edges is equal to 2 * (number of -1 edges in the tree). \n\nSo the sum of all nodes' counts is even.\n\nBut each node's count is odd, so the sum is n * (number of nodes with odd count). Wait, no—each node contributes 1 mod 2. So the sum is n mod 2.\n\nSo 2k ≡ n mod 2 → 0 ≡ n mod 2.\n\nThus, n must be even for there to be any solution. Because 2k is always even, and n must be even for the sum of n (each node's count mod 2) to be even.\n\nSo for n even, it's possible; for n odd, it's impossible. So when n is odd, the answer is 0.\n\nSo that's a key insight. So for even n, the sum is non-zero, and for odd n, it's zero.\n\nWait, but n=1 is odd, and the answer is zero. For n=2, even, and the sum is -1.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to handling even n.\n\nBut for even n, how to compute the sum?\n\nLet me think about the sum over all good trees of d(1, n).\n\nd(1, n) is the sum of the weights along the unique path from 1 to n.\n\nIn the tree, each edge is on some path. For a given tree, the path from 1 to n is fixed.\n\nSo for each tree, we add the sum of the edges along this path.\n\nWe need to sum this value over all good trees.\n\nHmm. So perhaps we can model this by looking at each edge's contribution to the sum.\n\nBut how? Because for each tree, whether an edge is on the path from 1 to n depends on the structure of the tree.\n\nBut considering that for all good trees, each edge is included or not in the path, depending on the tree.\n\nWait, maybe we can express the sum as the sum over all edges of the probability that the edge is on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by the possible values (1 or -1) that the edge can take, and considering the number of times each possibility occurs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find for each edge e, the expected value of its contribution (i.e., whether it's on the path, and its weight) across all good trees, and then multiply by the total number of good trees.\n\nWait, that might be a viable approach.\n\nLet me denote the total number of good trees as T. For each edge e, let’s compute the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by the sum of the contributions of e (which is either 1 or -1) in those trees.\n\nBut since the path depends on the tree structure, this seems challenging.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each edge e, regardless of the tree structure, the number of times e is on the path from 1 to n in all good trees is a fixed fraction of the total number of good trees.\n\nIf that's the case, then we can compute for each edge e, the expected contribution (sum of weights) it makes across all good trees, and then sum these contributions.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem in terms of dynamic programming or combinatorial mathematics.\n\nAnother angle: the condition on the edges implies that the tree has certain properties. Perhaps the tree is a bipartitioned in a certain way, making the path from 1 to n deterministic.\n\nWait, considering that each node has an odd number of -1 edges. So for the root node 1, the number of -1 edges is odd. So the path from 1 to any other node must have an even number of edges when moving away from 1, or something along those lines.\n\nWait, perhaps the tree must form a structure where the path from 1 to n has a certain parity of edges with weight -1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the path from 1 to n must have an even number of -1 edges.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's see for n=4.\n\nIn the chain 1-2-3-4, the path is 1-2-3-4. The edges are e1=-1, e2=1, e3=-1. So the sum is (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1.\n\nIn the star-shaped tree, the path is just the edge from 1 to 4, which is -1.\n\nSo for n=4, the two good trees have different d(1,4) values.\n\nHmm. So the sum is -1 + (-1) = -2. Wait, no, in the sample input, n=4 output was -10. Oh, wait, the sample input for n=4 was:\n\n16 good trees. The sum is -10.\n\nWait, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck.\n\nIn the third sample input, n=4, the output is -10, which is 998244343 modulo 998244353.\n\nSo there are 16 good trees. The sum is -10.\n\nWait, but in the chain and star cases, I found two trees contributing -1 and -1. So their sum would be -2, but the actual sum is -10. So there's more than two good trees. So my earlier reasoning about the chain being a solution was incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the chain for n=4 is a good tree.\n\nLet me re-calculate for the chain 1-2-3-4.\n\nEach edge is e1 (1-2), e2 (2-3), e3 (3-4).\n\nConditions:\n\nnode1: e1 = -1.\n\nnode2: e1 * e2 = -1.\n\nnode3: e2 * e3 = -1.\n\nnode4: e3 = -1.\n\nSo e1 = -1.\n\ne2 = 1 (since e1 * e2 = -1 → (-1)*e2 = -1 → e2 = 1).\n\ne3 = -1.\n\nSo the edges are e1=-1, e2=1, e3=-1.\n\nThe path from 1 to 4 is e1 + e2 + e3 = (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1.\n\nSo this is one good tree.\n\nBut wait, are there other good trees for n=4?\n\nAnother possible tree is the star, but what about other structures, like a tree where 1 is connected to 2 and 3, and 2 is connected to 4.\n\nSo edges are 1-2 (e1), 1-3 (e2), 2-4 (e3).\n\nConditions:\n\nnode1: e1 * e2 = -1.\n\nnode2: e1 * e3 = -1.\n\nnode3: e2 = -1.\n\nnode4: e3 = -1.\n\nSo from node3: e2 = -1.\n\nFrom node4: e3 = -1.\n\nFrom node1: e1 * (-1) = -1 → e1 = 1.\n\nFrom node2: 1 * (-1) = -1 → satisfies.\n\nSo edges are e1=1, e2=-1, e3=-1.\n\nThe path from 1 to 4 is 1-2-4. The sum is e1 + e3 = 1 + (-1) = 0.\n\nSo this is another good tree.\n\nSo for n=4, the sum is (-1) [from chain] + 0 [from this tree] plus the star tree which has sum -1. Are there more trees?\n\nWait, let's think about other possible trees.\n\nAnother structure: 1 connected to 2 and 3, and 3 connected to 4.\n\nEdges: 1-2 (e1), 1-3 (e2), 3-4 (e3).\n\nConditions:\n\nnode1: e1 * e2 = -1.\n\nnode2: e1 = -1.\n\nnode3: e2 * e3 = -1.\n\nnode4: e3 = -1.\n\nSo e1 = -1.\n\ne2 * e3 = -1 → e2 = -e3.\n\ne3 = -1 → e2 = 1.\n\nSo edges are e1=-1, e2=1, e3=-1.\n\nPath from 1 to4 is 1-3-4. Sum is e2 + e3 = 1 + (-1) = 0.\n\nSo this is another good tree.\n\nSo for n=4, we have at least four good trees:\n\n1. Chain: sum -1.\n\n2. Star: sum -1.\n\n3. Tree with edges 1-2, 1-3, 2-4: sum 0.\n\n4. Tree with edges 1-2, 1-3, 3-4: sum 0.\n\nWait, but the sample says there are 16 good trees. So perhaps each edge can be chosen in various ways, as long as the conditions are met.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial analysis was wrong, and the star-shaped tree isn't the only possibility. Maybe each node's edges can be arranged in a way that satisfies the product condition, leading to multiple possibilities.\n\nSo the problem is getting complicated.\n\nPerhaps another approach: for each edge, determine how often it is part of the path from 1 to n in all good trees, and what is the sum of its contributions (1 or -1) multiplied by the number of such trees.\n\nBut since each edge can be either 1 or -1, this becomes tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum can be expressed as the sum over all edges of the number of good trees where the edge is on the path from 1 to n multiplied by the average value of the edge in those trees.\n\nWait, but the edge's value is determined by the tree's structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum can be broken down into each edge's contribution, considering whether it's on the path and how it's weighted.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative idea: for each edge, determine the number of good trees where the edge is on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by the expected value of the edge's weight in those trees.\n\nBut how to find this expectation.\n\nWait, perhaps for each edge e, the probability that e is on the path from 1 to n in a good tree is some function f(e). Then, the expected contribution of e is f(e) * (average of its possible values in the trees where it's on the path).\n\nBut the average value depends on the possible configurations of the tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each edge e, the sum over all good trees of its contribution is equal to the number of good trees where e is on the path multiplied by the sum of its possible weights in those trees.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled using generating functions or matrix exponentiation, but I'm not seeing it immediately.\n\nAnother approach: consider that the product condition for each node implies that the tree is a bipartition with 1 and n in the same partition. Or perhaps the tree is a bipartition where the parity of the depth from 1 to any node determines the edge signs.\n\nWait, let's think about the product condition for each node. Each node has an odd number of -1 edges. So the number of -1 edges is 1, 3, etc.\n\nIf we model the tree as a graph where each node's edges alternate in sign based on the depth, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tree must form a structure where the path from 1 to n has an even number of edges with -1. Because, for each node along the path, the number of -1 edges must be odd. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, for the path from 1 to n, each node on the path (except 1 and n) has two edges on the path. So their product is (-1)^k, where k is the number of -1 edges on the path up to that node.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too vague.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of linear algebra again. For each node, the product of its edges is -1. So for each node, the sum (mod 2) of the edges is 1. Because each edge is a variable x_e ∈ {+1, -1}, and the product is -1 iff the sum is 1 mod 2.\n\nWait, because the product of x_e's is -1 if and only if the count of -1 edges is odd, which is equivalent to the sum mod 2 being 1.\n\nSo for each node i, sum_{e incident to i} x_e ≡ 1 mod 2.\n\nThis forms a system of linear equations over GF(2). The variables are x_e for each edge e.\n\nThe number of variables is n-1. The number of equations is n.\n\nBut for a tree, the equations are dependent. So the rank of the system is less than n.\n\nWait, but what is the rank? Let's see for small n.\n\nn=2: two equations (x1 ≡ 1 mod 2 for both nodes). So the system is consistent and has rank 1. Variables: 1. Solution exists.\n\nn=4: let's see. Equations for nodes 1,2,3,4.\n\nEach equation is the sum of edges incident to the node equals 1 mod 2.\n\nBut for a tree, the sum of all equations is equal to 2*(sum of variables) mod 2, which is 0. But the sum of RHS is 4 mod 2 = 0. So the equations are consistent.\n\nWait, but for a tree, the sum of all node degrees is 2*(n-1) edges, but in GF(2), the sum of all equations is the sum of all x_e multiplied by 2, which is 0.\n\nSo for the system to be consistent, the sum of RHS must be 0 mod 2. Which for n even, it is, because sum is n mod 2 = 0.\n\nSo for even n, the system is consistent.\n\nSo the number of solutions is 2^{(number of variables - rank)}.\n\nBut what is the rank of the system for a tree? Hmm, perhaps it's n-1.\n\nWait, no. Because in a tree, the sum of all equations is 0, so the equations are dependent. So the rank is at most n-1.\n\nBut how much is it exactly?\n\nWait, for n=2, rank is 1.\n\nFor n=4, let's see:\n\nEquations:\n\n1: x1 + x2 + x3 = 1.\n\n2: x1 + x4 = 1.\n\n3: x2 + x4 = 1.\n\n4: x3 = 1.\n\nWait, wait, no. For a star-shaped tree with 4 nodes, node 1 is connected to 2,3,4. So edges are x1 (1-2), x2 (1-3), x3 (1-4).\n\nSo equations are:\n\nnode1: x1 x2 x3 = 1 mod 2 → x1 + x2 + x3 = 1.\n\nnode2: x1 = 1.\n\nnode3: x2 = 1.\n\nnode4: x3 = 1.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nx1=1, x2=1, x3=1.\n\nSum for node1: 1+1+1=3 mod 2=1 → correct.\n\nSo equations are:\n\nx1=1\n\nx2=1\n\nx3=1\n\nx1 + x2 + x3 = 1.\n\nThe last equation is redundant. So the rank is 3.\n\nBut variables are 3, so the solution is unique.\n\nSo the number of solutions is 2^{3-3}=1.\n\nWhich matches the earlier conclusion that the star-shaped tree is the only solution for n=4 in that particular tree structure.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the chain tree also satisfies the conditions. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equations for the chain.\n\nWait, for the chain 1-2-3-4, the edges are x1 (1-2), x2 (2-3), x3 (3-4).\n\nEquations:\n\nnode1: x1 = 1.\n\nnode2: x1 + x2 = 1.\n\nnode3: x2 + x3 = 1.\n\nnode4: x3 = 1.\n\nSo substituting x1=1, x3=1.\n\nFrom node2: 1 + x2 = 1 → x2 = 0.\n\nFrom node3: 0 + 1 = 1 → correct.\n\nSo the variables are x1=1, x2=0, x3=1.\n\nThus, the solution exists and is unique.\n\nSo for the chain, it's a valid solution.\n\nSo for n=4, there are multiple solutions, depending on the tree structure.\n\nSo the system's rank is n-1 for even n? Or perhaps it's n-1 when the tree is a chain.\n\nWait, but for the star-shaped tree, the rank was 3 (for n=4 variables), which is n-1=3. So yes.\n\nSo for a general tree, the rank is n-1, so the number of solutions is 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} = 1.\n\nWait, that can't be right because in the chain and star cases for n=4, there are multiple solutions.\n\nWait, perhaps the rank depends on the tree's structure. For example, in the chain, the rank is n-1, but in the star, it's also n-1.\n\nWait, but for n=4, both structures had rank 3, leading to 1 solution each.\n\nBut earlier, for the chain, we found a unique solution, but for another tree structure, perhaps another solution exists.\n\nWait, maybe for a different tree structure, the rank is lower.\n\nWait, perhaps for the tree where node 1 is connected to 2 and 3, and node 2 is connected to 4, the equations are:\n\nnode1: x1 + x2 = 1.\n\nnode2: x1 + x3 = 1.\n\nnode3: x2 = 1.\n\nnode4: x3 = 1.\n\nSubstituting x3=1, x2=1.\n\nFrom node1: x1 + 1 = 1 → x1=0.\n\nFrom node2: 0 + 1 = 1 → correct.\n\nSo variables are x1=0, x2=1, x3=1.\n\nSo this is another solution.\n\nSo for this tree, the system has a unique solution.\n\nThus, each tree structure leads to a unique solution, but the system's rank is n-1, leading to 2^(variables - rank) = 1 solution per tree.\n\nBut wait, the number of variables is n-1. So variables - rank is (n-1)-(n-1)=0 → 2^0=1 solution.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThus, each tree structure corresponds to exactly one solution of the system.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the number of good trees is n^{n-2} * 2^{n-1}. So for n=4, it's 4^2 * 2^3 = 16*8=128. But earlier, for n=4, the sample says 16 good trees.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Because in the problem statement, the total number of edge-weighted trees is n^{n-2} * 2^{n-1}. So for n=4, that's 4^2 * 2^3 = 16*8=128. But according to the sample input, n=4 has 16 good trees.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts.\n\nWait, the problem defines a good tree as satisfying the product condition. So among all possible edge-weighted trees, only some are good.\n\nSo the number of good trees is a subset of the total.\n\nSo for n=4, the sample says 16 good trees. So perhaps each edge can be assigned in certain ways, but the constraints limit this.\n\nSo back to the problem.\n\nWe have to find, for each edge, how often it is on the path from 1 to n in all good trees, and for each occurrence, the sum of its contributions.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative idea: the path from 1 to n must have a certain property based on the system of equations.\n\nEach node along the path contributes to the product, but perhaps the path itself must have an even number of -1 edges.\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum d(1, n) can be expressed in terms of the XOR of certain variables.\n\nWait, considering that each edge is either 1 or -1, which can be represented as 0 or 1 in GF(2). Because -1 mod 2 is 1, and 1 mod 2 is 0.\n\nWait, no, actually, perhaps it's better to represent the edges as 1 for -1 and 0 for 1. Then, the product condition becomes the sum mod 2 of the edges incident to each node being 1.\n\nSo for each node i, sum_{e ∋ i} x_e ≡ 1 mod 2.\n\nAnd d(1, n) is the sum of the edges on the path from 1 to n, where each edge is either 1 or -1.\n\nWait, but the sum in integers is the sum of 1s and -1s, which can be represented as the count of -1 edges on the path minus the count of 1 edges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum can be represented in terms of the binary variables.\n\nWait, but this might complicate things further.\n\nAlternative plan: for each edge, determine how many times it appears on the path from 1 to n across all good trees. Multiply that by the average value of the edge in those trees, then sum for all edges.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nWait, perhaps the expected value of d(1, n) across all good trees is equal to the sum over all edges of the probability that the edge is on the path multiplied by the expected value of the edge in those cases.\n\nBut the edge's value depends on the tree structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum can be expressed as the sum of all edges' contributions, where each edge's contribution is the number of good trees where it's on the path multiplied by (1 * a + (-1) * b), where a is the number of such trees where the edge is 1, and b where it's -1.\n\nBut that seems difficult to compute.\n\nWait, but perhaps the edge's value is determined by the system of equations.\n\nFor each edge e, in the solution to the system, its value is fixed as either 1 or -1. Because each tree corresponds to a unique solution of the system.\n\nThus, for each tree, the edge e is either 1 or -1, and this is fixed based on the tree's structure.\n\nWait, but that's not the case. Because each tree corresponds to a unique solution, but the solution can vary based on the tree.\n\nWait, no. Each tree's edge assignments must satisfy the system, which is a set of constraints. So for each tree, the edge values are determined by the constraints.\n\nWait, but for a given tree, the system of equations is different. Because the tree's structure defines which edges are present.\n\nAh, right. So for each tree, the edges are a subset of all possible edges, and the system is defined over that subset.\n\nSo for a particular tree, the system's solution is unique.\n\nThus, each edge in the tree has a fixed value (either 1 or -1) based on the system's solution.\n\nBut across different trees, the edges may have different values.\n\nSo, the sum over all good trees is the sum of d(1, n) for each tree.\n\nEach d(1, n) is the sum of the edges on the path from 1 to n, each edge being either 1 or -1.\n\nSo for each tree, we can compute d(1, n) as the sum of its edges on the path.\n\nBut the question is how to compute the sum across all trees.\n\nAlternative Idea: Notice that the sum can be split into the contribution of each edge on the path. So, for each edge e, compute the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by the sum of e's values in those trees.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each edge e, the probability that e is on the path from 1 to n in a good tree is p_e. Then, the expected value of e's contribution is p_e * (E[e]), where E[e] is the average value of e across all such trees.\n\nBut the problem is that E[e] depends on the configuration of the tree.\n\nWait, but perhaps the value of e is determined uniquely by the constraints, so for each tree, e's value is fixed once the tree is known.\n\nBut across trees, e can vary.\n\nSo, perhaps for each edge e, the sum of its contributions across all good trees is equal to the number of good trees where e is on the path multiplied by the sum of e's values in those trees.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nWait, but for each edge e, the value is determined by the system of equations for the tree. So, perhaps the sum of e's values across all trees where e is on the path is equal to the number of such trees multiplied by the average value of e in those trees.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps the sum of d(1, n) across all good trees can be expressed in terms of the system of equations, considering the parity constraints.\n\nWait, let me think about the sum S.\n\nS = sum_{T is good} d(1, n).\n\nEach term d(1, n) is the sum of the edges on the path from 1 to n in tree T.\n\nSo S is the sum over all good trees of the sum",
