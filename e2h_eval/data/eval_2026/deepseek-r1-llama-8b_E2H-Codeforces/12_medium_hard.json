The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Xenia is trying to complete her tasks by moving along a ringroad. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem statement says that Xenia lives in a city with n houses arranged in a ring. The traffic is one-way and clockwise. She starts at house 1 and has m tasks. For each task i, she must be at house ai, and she needs to have completed all tasks with numbers less than i before. So the order of the tasks matters because each subsequent task must be handled after the previous ones.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks. Each move from one house to an adjacent one takes one unit of time.\n\nHmm. So, what's the approach here? I think I need to model her movements efficiently, considering the constraints of the tasks.\n\nLet me think about how she moves. She starts at house 1. The first task is to go to a1, but since it's the first task, she just needs to get there as quickly as possible. Then, for the second task a2, she must go to a2 after having completed a1. But wait, no—wait, the problem says that for the i-th task, she needs to be in ai and have completed all tasks j < i. So the order of the tasks is important, but she can arrange the order in which she does them. Or is the order fixed as the given a1, a2, ..., am?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"for the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\" So the order of the tasks is not arbitrary; she must process them in the order given. So the first task is a1, then a2, etc., up to am. So the sequence is fixed as per the input.\n\nSo the movement must be such that for each i from 1 to m, she is at ai after completing all previous tasks.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that she has m tasks, and the i-th task requires her to be at ai and have completed all tasks with numbers less than i. So the tasks are processed in the order 1, 2, ..., m. So the sequence is fixed as per the input array.\n\nSo the order is fixed. So she must first perform task 1 (at a1), then task 2 (at a2), then task 3 (a3), etc., up to task m.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to find the minimal time to perform these tasks in the given order, ensuring that each task is done in the correct order.\n\nSo the key is to model her path as moving from the current position to the next required task's position, but considering that sometimes it's better to loop around the ring road to minimize the total distance.\n\nNow, the ring road is circular. So the distance between two points can be either clockwise or counter-clockwise. But since the traffic is one-way and clockwise, she can't move counter-clockwise. So all movement is in the clockwise direction.\n\nWait, that's important. Because the ring is one-way, she can only move clockwise. So when calculating the distance from a current position to a target, she can only take the clockwise path. So for example, if she's at house 4 on a ring of 4 houses, and needs to go to house 2, the distance would be 2 (4 →1→2). Because she can't go counter-clockwise.\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify. The ring is numbered 1 through n in clockwise order. So the next house after 1 is 2, then 3, etc., up to n, which loops back to 1.\n\nBut the ring is one-way, so she can only move in the clockwise direction. So to go from house x to y, the distance is (y -x) mod n, but since movement is only clockwise, she must take the shortest path in that direction.\n\nWait, no. For example, if n=4 and she is at 4, and needs to go to 2, the clockwise path is 4 →1 →2, which is 2 steps. Alternatively, the other way is 4 →3 →2, but that's longer, so she takes the shorter path.\n\nWait, no. Because the ring is one-way, she can't choose the counter-clockwise path. She can only move in the clockwise direction. So she has to go from 4 to 1 to 2, which is 2 steps. So the distance is (2 -4 +4) mod 4 = 2. Wait, (2-4) is negative, but mod n gives 2. So yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, more accurately, the minimal steps needed to go from x to y in a ring of n houses, moving only clockwise, is (y -x) mod n, but if that's negative, mod n again. Because when you subtract x from y, if y > x, it's positive. If y < x, it wraps around.\n\nWait, for x=4, y=2, n=4: (2-4) is -2, mod 4 is 2. So the distance is 2 steps.\n\nYes. So the formula for the distance is (target - current) mod n. Because she can't move counter-clockwise, so she has to take the path that goes through the higher-numbered houses.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to finding the optimal path that goes through a1, a2, ..., am in order, such that the sum of the distances is minimized, and each step is the minimal possible in the clockwise direction.\n\nWait, but the problem is that some tasks may have the same position as others, or may require revisiting previous positions. So, for example, in the sample input, the sequence is 3,2,3. So she starts at 1, goes to 3, then to 2, then back to 3.\n\nHmm. So let's model this.\n\nShe starts at position 1.\n\nFor the first task, she needs to go to a1=3.\n\nThe distance from 1 to 3 is 2 steps (1→2→3).\n\nThen, for the second task, a2=2: she is currently at 3. The distance from 3 to 2 is (2-3) mod4 = ( -1 ) mod4 = 3. Wait, that's 3 steps: 3→4→1→2. That would be 3 steps.\n\nWait, but in the sample explanation, the total is 6 steps. Let me see:\n\nSample Input 1:\n4 3\n3 2 3\n\nSample Output: 6.\n\nExplanation: The path is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. So steps are 1 to 2 (1 step), 2→3 (another step, total 2), 3→4 (step3), 4→1 (step4), 1→2 (step5), 2→3 (step6). So total 6 steps.\n\nWait, but according to our initial calculation, the first move was from 1→3, which is 2 steps. But in the sample, it's 1→2→3, which is 2 steps as well. But why the difference?\n\nOh, because the first move could be either way, but perhaps taking the minimal path is better. But wait, the problem is that for each task, she must have already completed all previous tasks. So the order is fixed. So the path must be such that each task is processed in order.\n\nWait, no. The tasks are given in the order 1, 2, 3. So for the first task, she must be at a1, then for the second, at a2, etc.\n\nSo the movement between the tasks must follow the order of the tasks. So the movement from the current position to the next task's position must be done in the minimal way, but also considering that the path between them is the minimal possible.\n\nWait, but perhaps sometimes it's better to loop around the ring to save steps in the long run.\n\nSo the problem is to compute the minimal total distance by moving from the starting point (1) to a1, then to a2, etc., up to am, choosing the minimal path between consecutive tasks.\n\nBut we need to calculate the sum of the distances between each pair of consecutive positions, in the order of the tasks.\n\nWait, but the problem allows for multiple visits to the same house, but the minimal path would likely involve not making unnecessary loops. So perhaps the minimal total distance is the sum of the distances between the current position and the next task's position, each calculated as (next - current) mod n, but considering that when you have to wrap around.\n\nBut how do we model the path from the current position to the next task's position, given that she can only move clockwise?\n\nLet me think of the process:\n\nStart at pos = 1.\n\nFor each task i from 1 to m:\n\n   current task is a_i.\n\n   Compute the minimal distance from pos to a_i.\n\n   Add this distance to the total.\n\n   Update pos to a_i.\n\nSo, the sum of these distances is the answer.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input 1:\n\nn=4, m=3.\n\nTasks: 3,2,3.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\npos = 1.\n\ntask 1: 3.\n\ndistance from 1 to 3 is (3-1) mod4 = 2 steps.\n\nsum = 2.\n\npos becomes 3.\n\ntask 2: 2.\n\ndistance from 3 to 2: (2-3) mod4 is ( -1 ) mod4 = 3 steps.\n\nsum +=3 →5.\n\npos becomes 2.\n\ntask3:3.\n\ndistance from 2 to3: (3-2) mod4=1 step.\n\nsum +=1 →6.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nIn the second sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3.\n\ntasks:2,3,3.\n\nProcessing:\n\npos=1.\n\ntask1:2.\n\ndistance 1→2 is 1 step.\n\nsum=1.\n\npos=2.\n\ntask2:3.\n\ndistance 2→3 is 1 step.\n\nsum=2.\n\npos=3.\n\ntask3:3.\n\ndistance 0 steps.\n\nsum remains 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nBut wait, is this always the case? Like, is the minimal total distance simply the sum of the distances between each consecutive pair of tasks, considering their order, regardless of any possible optimizations by looping?\n\nBecause sometimes, for example, if a_i is much smaller than the current pos, it's better to loop around the ring to reach a_i quickly.\n\nWait, but in the way we're computing the distance, (a_i - current_pos) mod n, which gives the minimal steps in the clockwise direction, right? Because (a_i - current_pos) can be negative, but mod n ensures that the result is the minimal positive steps needed in the clockwise direction.\n\nWait, for example:\n\ncurrent_pos is 4, a_i is 2, n=4.\n\n(2-4) mod4 is (-2 mod4)= 2.\n\nWhich is the correct minimal steps (4→1→2, 2 steps).\n\nAnother example:\n\ncurrent_pos is 3, a_i is 1, n=4.\n\n(1-3) mod4 is (-2 mod4) = 2 steps. Which is 3→4→1, 2 steps.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the approach is to compute for each consecutive pair (current, next) the distance as (next - current) mod n, and sum all these distances.\n\nThus, the solution is to:\n\n1. Sort the tasks in the given order.\n\n2. Initialize current_pos as 1.\n\n3. For each task in the list a1, a2, ..., am:\n\n   a. Compute distance from current_pos to a_i.\n\n   b. Add this to the total time.\n\n   c. Set current_pos to a_i.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's.\n\nCompute the sum of (a[i] - current) mod n for each i, starting with current=1.\n\nWait, but wait: the a's are given in the order of the tasks. So the first a is a1, which is the first task, then a2, etc.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor each ai in a_list:\n\n    distance = (ai - current) % n\n\n    total += distance\n\n    current = ai\n\nreturn total\n\nBut wait, is this correct?\n\nLet me test another scenario.\n\nSuppose n=5, m=3, a_list = [3,4,5].\n\nProcess:\n\ncurrent=1.\n\na1=3: (3-1) mod5=2 → total=2.\n\ncurrent=3.\n\na2=4: (4-3)=1 → total=3.\n\ncurrent=4.\n\na3=5: (5-4)=1 → total=4.\n\nSo the path is 1→3 (2 steps), 3→4 (1), 4→5 (1). Total 4 steps.\n\nAlternative path: 1→2→3→4→5: that's 4 steps as well. So same.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=5, a_list = [2,5,3].\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent=1.\n\na1=2: distance 1 → total 1.\n\ncurrent=2.\n\na2=5: (5-2) mod5=3 → total 4.\n\ncurrent=5.\n\na3=3: (3-5) mod5= ( -2 mod5 )=3. So add 3 → total 7.\n\nPath is 1→2 (1), 2→5 (3 steps: 2→3→4→5), 5→3 (steps:5→1→2→3: 3 steps).\n\nTotal steps 1+3+3=7.\n\nIs there a better way? Well, perhaps she could have gone from 5 to 3 via 5→4→3, which is 2 steps, but in this case, the distance is (3-5) mod5= ( -2 mod5 )=3, which is the minimal path.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 5 to 3: moving clockwise, the path is 5→1→2→3, which is 3 steps. Alternatively, counter-clockwise would be 5→4→3, but since she can't move counter-clockwise, she has to take the 3 steps.\n\nSo yes, the approach correctly calculates the minimal steps.\n\nSo, the plan is to read the list of a's, compute the sum of the distances between each consecutive pair, including from 1 to a1, then a1 to a2, etc.\n\nThus, the code should be straightforward.\n\nNow, in terms of handling the input:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line has n and m, the second has m integers.\n\nSo, in Python, reading from stdin:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen, compute the sum as described.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first example is ['4 3\\n3 2 3'], which is a string. But in the actual code, perhaps it's read as a single line. So in code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal = 0\nfor ai in a_list:\n    dist = (ai - current) % n\n    total += dist\n    current = ai\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the a_list is [3,2,3], and the code would compute:\n\n1 to 3: 2 steps.\n\n3 to 2: (2-3) mod4 = -1 mod4 = 3 steps.\n\n2 to3: 1 step.\n\nTotal 2+3+1=6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSecond sample:\n\na_list = [2,3,3].\n\n1→2: 1 step.\n\n2→3: 1.\n\n3→3: 0.\n\nTotal 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo this code works for the samples.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where all a_i are 1.\n\nFor example, n=5, m=3, a_list = [1,1,1].\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent =1.\n\nEach a_i is 1.\n\nDistance each time is 0.\n\nTotal is 0.\n\nWhich makes sense, as she's already there.\n\nAnother case: a_i is always increasing.\n\nn=5, a_list = [1,2,3,4,5].\n\nDistances:\n\n1-1=0.\n\n2-1=1.\n\n3-2=1.\n\n4-3=1.\n\n5-4=1.\n\nTotal 0+1+1+1+1=4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: a_i is always decreasing.\n\nn=5, a_list = [5,4,3,2,1].\n\nDistances:\n\n5-1= (5-1) mod5=4.\n\n4-5: (4-5) mod5 = 4.\n\n3-4: (3-4) mod5=4.\n\n2-3: (2-3) mod5=4.\n\n1-2: (1-2) mod5=4.\n\nTotal 4*5=20 steps.\n\nWhich is correct because she has to go all the way around the ring each time.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nThus, the approach is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks given that she can only move clockwise along the ringroad. Each task must be completed in the order provided, and she must be at the specified house for each task.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must move clockwise around a ring of `n` houses. She has `m` tasks, each requiring her to be at a specific house in the given order. The goal is to find the minimum time to complete all tasks by moving clockwise.\n2. **Intuition**: For each task, Xenia must move from her current position to the next required house. The distance between two houses when moving clockwise is calculated as `(target - current) % n`, which gives the minimal steps needed.\n3. **Algorithm**: \n   - Initialize the starting position at house 1.\n   - For each task in the given order, compute the clockwise distance from the current position to the target house.\n   - Sum these distances to get the total time required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor a in a_list:\n    distance = (a - current) % n\n    total_time += distance\n    current = a\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of tasks), followed by `m` integers representing the sequence of tasks.\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with a total time of 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the clockwise distance from the current house to the target house using modulo arithmetic. Update the total time and set the current position to the target house.\n- **Output the Result**: Print the total time after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimal time by leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad.",
