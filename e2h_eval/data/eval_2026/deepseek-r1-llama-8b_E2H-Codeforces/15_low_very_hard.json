They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine all winning integers x in a tournament setup. The tournament is structured in a way similar to a single-elimination bracket, and the outcome of each game depends on the string s given.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the tournament has 2^n teams. They play 2^n - 1 games. The structure is such that in each phase i (from 1 to n), there are 2^{n-i} games. For example, the first phase has 2^{n-1} games, pairing the teams as 1v2, 3v4, etc. Each game eliminates one team, so after phase 1, there are 2^{n-1} teams left.\n\nThe second phase (phase 2) then takes these winners and pairs them again, but the pairing is based on previous groupings. Wait, no, maybe it's more like the next level of the bracket. So phase 1 has groups of 2, phase 2 has groups of 4, phase 3 has groups of 8, etc., until the final phase which has just one game.\n\nEach game's outcome is determined by the corresponding character in s. If s[i] is '0', then in each match during phase i, the lower-skilled team wins. If s[i] is '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nOur task is to find all possible x such that there exists a permutation p of 1..2^n where team x can be the champion.\n\nHmm, okay. So for each x, we need to check if there's a permutation p where x wins the tournament, based on the rules given by s.\n\nBut how do I model this? It seems like a recursive or dynamic programming approach might be needed, considering the structure of the tournament.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of binary representations or some kind of tree structure. Because each phase reduces the number of teams by half, similar to a binary heap.\n\nLet me think about the phases:\n\nPhase 1: 2^{n-1} games, each between consecutive pairs. The winner proceeds.\nPhase 2: 2^{n-2} games, each between the winners of two consecutive phase 1 games.\nAnd so on until phase n, which has one game.\n\nSo each phase is a level in a binary tournament tree.\n\nEach game in phase i is determined by whether the higher or lower skill wins, based on s[i].\n\nNow, the key is that the tournament is a binary tree, and each node represents a game, with its children being the two sub-games in the previous phase.\n\nFor a particular x to win, it must win all its games in every phase it's involved in.\n\nSo the idea is to model the tournament as a binary tree, where each node is a game. Each node has two children representing the sub-games that feed into it.\n\nWait, but building such a tree for n=18 is impossible because 2^18 is 262144, and the number of nodes would be 2^18 - 1, which is way too big.\n\nThat's not feasible. So we need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative approach: For each position in the tournament bracket, determine the set of possible ranks (skills) that can reach that position, based on the s string.\n\nWait, perhaps for each round, we can model the possible winners in that round, given the previous round's winners.\n\nYes, this seems manageable.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nWe can represent the tournament as a series of rounds. Each round corresponds to a phase. In each round, the number of teams is halved.\n\nAt each step, for each possible subset of teams that could win up to that point, we can compute which teams could advance.\n\nBut even that might be too slow for n=18, as the number of possible subsets is enormous.\n\nHmm. So another approach: Since the tournament is a binary tree, perhaps each team's path to the final can be represented as a binary string, indicating which side of each game they were in.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the tournament as a series of binary choices. For each round, a team must win their game to proceed.\n\nIn each round, the matches are grouped into blocks of size 2^{current_round_size}, where each block is a group of 2^{k} teams that will compete among themselves in the current round.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think differently.\n\nEach phase i has 2^{n-i} games. Each game is between two teams that came from the previous phase's games.\n\nFor example, in phase 1, each game is between two adjacent teams (1v2, 3v4, etc.). The winners of these games form the teams for phase 2.\n\nIn phase 2, the winners from phase 1 are grouped into blocks of 2, and each",

The tournament structure is similar to a single-elimination bracket, and the outcome of each game depends on whether the lower-skilled or higher-skilled team wins based on the string provided.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament is structured in phases, where each phase halves the number of teams until only one champion remains. Each phase's games are determined by the string `s`, where '0' means the lower-skilled team wins, and '1' means the higher-skilled team wins.\n2. **Binary Tree Representation**: The tournament can be visualized as a binary tree where each node represents a game. Each game has two children representing the sub-games that feed into it.\n3. **Dynamic Programming with Bitmasking**: We use dynamic programming (DP) with bitmasking to keep track of possible winners at each level of the tournament. Each bitmask represents a set of possible winners at a particular level.\n4. **Recursive Check**: For each possible starting point in the permutation, recursively check if the current team can win all its games considering the rules specified by the string `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Precompute for each round the direction of comparison\n    rounds = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if s[i] == '0':\n            # Lower skill wins, so for a group of 2^k, the winner must be the smaller one\n            rounds.append(0)\n        else:\n            # Higher skill wins, so the winner must be the larger one\n            rounds.append(1)\n    \n    # Now, we need to find all possible x such that there exists a permutation p where x is the champion\n    \n    # We can model the tournament as a series of rounds, each halving the number of candidates\n    \n    # Let's represent the possible winners as a list of sets, where each level corresponds to a round\n    dp = [set() for _ in range(n+1)]\n    dp[0] = {1}\n    \n    for level in range(n):\n        k = 2 ** (n - level)\n        next_dp = set()\n        for group_start in range(0, len(dp[level]), k):\n            group = dp[level][group_start:group_start + k]\n            if not group:\n                continue\n            # For this group, determine which subsets can win the next round\n            for subset in group:\n                for winner in subset:\n                    pass\n            # Generate all possible subsets of size k from the current group\n            for subset in product(group, repeat=k):\n                if len(subset) != k:\n                    continue\n                # Check if the subset can produce a winner according to the current round's rule\n                valid = True\n                for i in range(k//2):\n                    a, b = subset[2*i], subset[2*i+1]\n                    if rounds[level] == 0:\n                        if a > b:\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n                    else:\n                        if a < b:\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n                if valid:\n                    next_dp.add(subset[0])\n        dp[level+1] = next_dp\n    \n    # The final level is level n, and the possible winners are in dp[n]\n    winners = sorted(dp[n])\n    \n    # Now, for each possible starting position, check if it's possible to have x as the champion\n    # But wait, the initial approach might not capture all possibilities because the initial grouping might vary\n    # So perhaps a different approach is needed\n    \n    # Alternative approach: For each possible x, check if it can reach the top through all rounds\n    # This requires checking the possible paths x can take through the tournament\n    \n    # Let's try this alternative approach\n    \n    # To do this, we can model the tournament as a binary tree and for each node, track possible winners\n    # We'll represent the tournament as a binary tree, and for each node, determine the possible winners based on the rules\n    \n    # Another way is to think about the tournament as a binary heap, where each node has a left and right child\n    # For each node, the winner must come from either the left or right subtree, depending on the rules\n    \n    # However, implementing this directly is challenging, so perhaps we can use memoization and recursion\n    \n    # Let's try to model the tournament recursively.

For level 1, only the winners of the first phase games are present, and so on\n    \n    # So, for each level, we can compute the possible winners based on the previous level's winners and the current round's rules\n    \n    # This seems manageable.
