The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where Neko found some treasure chests and keys, and needs to open as many chests as possible. The way it works is that each key can unlock a chest if the sum of their numbers is odd. Hmm, right.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. So the problem is about matching keys and chests such that a_i + b_j is odd. Which means one is even and the other is odd. Because an even plus an odd is odd, and vice versa.\n\nSo the first thing I need to do is figure out how many chests are even and how many are odd, similarly for the keys. Because each key can only be used once, and each chest once.\n\nWait, right. So for each key, if it's even, it can only open chests with odd a_i. And if the key is odd, then it can open chests with even a_i.\n\nSo maybe the optimal way is to count:\n\n- The number of even chests: let's call it E_c.\n- The number of odd chests: O_c = total chests - E_c.\n- Similarly, count even and odd keys: E_k and O_k.\n\nThen, the maximum possible chests we can open is determined by how we match these.\n\nBecause each even key can pair with an odd chest, but each such pairing uses up one key and one chest. Similarly, each odd key pairs with even chest.\n\nSo the maximum number of chests we can open is min(E_k * O_c, O_k * E_c) )? Or wait, no. Wait, perhaps not exactly.\n\nWait, no. Because each key can be used once. So for example, suppose we have a lot of even keys. We can use as many as possible on the odd chests, but each even key can only unlock one chest.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as the maximum number of pairs between even keys and odd chests, plus the maximum number of pairs between odd keys and even chests. But since each key can be used once, and each chest can be used once, the total is the sum of these two, but ensuring that we don't exceed the available keys or chests.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nEach key can be used to unlock at most one chest. Each chest can be unlocked by at most one key.\n\nSo the problem reduces to selecting a subset of (key, chest) pairs where each key is used once, each chest is used once, and a_i + b_j is odd.\n\nBut how to maximize the number of such pairs.\n\nThe key insight is that the parity of a_i and b_j must differ. So, for each key, it's either even or odd.\n\nSo the maximum number of chests that can be opened is the maximum number of pairs between:\n\n- Even keys and odd chests\n- Odd keys and even chests\n\nBut also, the sum of these two cannot exceed the minimum of the total keys and chests. Because each key and chest can only be used once.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum of the two could be more than the minimum of keys and chests, but we can't take more than the available keys or chests.\n\nWait, no. Because for the even key part: the number of even keys is E_k, and the number of odd chests is O_c. So the maximum possible is min(E_k, O_c). Similarly, for the odd keys and even chests: min(O_k, E_c). So the total is the sum of these two minima, but we can't exceed the minimum of (E_k + O_k) and (O_c + E_c), which is just n because the total chests is n.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily correct. Because, for example, if E_k is 5, O_c is 3, then the even keys can only pair with 3 chests, leaving 2 even keys unused. Then, for the odd keys and even chests: O_k might be 4, and E_c is 2 (since E_c is n - O_c, which was 3, so E_c is n - O_c). Wait, n is the total chests, so E_c = n_even_chests = number of chests with a_i even.\n\nSo after using even keys on odd chests, the remaining even chests (if any) can be used by odd keys.\n\nSo the total maximum is:\n\nsum = min(E_k, O_c) + min(O_k, E_c)\n\nBut wait, that might not always be possible because the sum could exceed the total number of chests. For example, if E_k is large enough to cover all O_c chests, and O_k is large enough to cover all E_c chests, then sum would be O_c + E_c = n, which is correct. But what if, say, E_k is larger than O_c, but O_k is smaller than E_c? Then sum would be O_c + O_k, but that's less",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. Each key can unlock a chest if their numbers have an odd sum, which means one must be even and the other odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Even and Odd Keys and Chests**: First, we count how many keys are even and how many are odd. Similarly, we count how many chests are even and how many are odd.\n2. **Match Even Keys with Odd Chests**: The maximum number of chests that can be unlocked using even keys is the minimum of the number of even keys and the number of odd chests.\n3. **Match Odd Keys with Even Chests**: Similarly, the maximum number of chests that can be unlocked using odd keys is the minimum of the number of odd keys and the number of even chests.\n4. **Sum the Matches**: The total number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the two matches from steps 2 and 3.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Count even and odd in a and b\neven_a = 0\nodd_a = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_a += 1\n    else:\n        odd_a += 1\n\neven_b = 0\nodd_b = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_b += 1\n    else:\n        odd_b += 1\n\n# Calculate possible matches\nmatch_even_key_odd_chest = min(even_b, odd_a)\nmatch_odd_key_even_chest = min(odd_b, even_a)\n\ntotal = match_even_key_odd_chest + match_odd_key_even_chest\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Counting Parity**: We start by counting how many of the chests and keys are even or odd. This helps us determine which keys can unlock which chests.\n- **Matching Logic**: By pairing even keys with odd chests and odd keys with even chests, we ensure that each key is used optimally to unlock a chest.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently counts and matches using simple loops and arithmetic operations, ensuring it runs in linear time, which is optimal for the given constraints.",
