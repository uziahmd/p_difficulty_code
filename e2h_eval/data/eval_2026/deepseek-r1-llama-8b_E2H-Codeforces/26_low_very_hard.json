Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on the sides. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem states that Yuri has favorite numbers A, B, C, D where A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. We need to find the number of triangles with integer sides x, y, z such that:\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B\nB ≤ y ≤ C\nC ≤ z ≤ D\n\nAnd also, these sides must satisfy the triangle inequality for a non-degenerate triangle. That means, x + y > z, because in a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. Since z is the largest here, we just need to check if x + y > z.\n\nWait, but wait: in our case, since x ≤ y ≤ z, because x is up to B, y starts at B and goes up to C, and z starts at C up to D. So the order is x ≤ y ≤ z, right? Because x can be as big as B, y can be as small as B, so x can be equal to y, or y can be bigger. Similarly, y can be as big as C, and z starts at C. So yes, x ≤ y ≤ z.\n\nSo the triangle inequality requires x + y > z. Because the other inequalities (x + z > y and y + z > x) are automatically satisfied when x ≤ y ≤ z. For example, x + z is definitely larger than y since z ≥ y and x is positive. Same for y + z > x.\n\nSo the key condition is x + y > z.\n\nNow, the goal is to count all possible triplets (x, y, z) that satisfy the above conditions and the triangle inequality.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently given that A, B, C, D can be up to 5e5, which is 500,000? So any O(n^3) approach is out of the question. Even O(n^2) would be too slow. So we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the approach.\n\nFirst, let's consider the ranges for x, y, z:\n\nx can range from A to B.\ny can range from B to C.\nz can range from C to D.\n\nBut since x ≤ y ≤ z, for each x, y must be >= x and <= C, and z must be >= y and <= D. Wait no: y is in B to C, and for a given x, y can be from max(B, x) to C. Because x can be up to B, so for x <= B, y starts at B, but for x < B, y can't be less than B. So for x in [A, B], y is in [max(x, B), C], and z is in [max(y, C), D].\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of y as starting at B, but for x >= B, y can start at x. Hmm, perhaps not. Let me rephrase.\n\nGiven that x ranges from A to B, inclusive. For each x, y can be from max(B, x) to C, because y has to be at least B and at least x. Wait, no. Because x can be up to B. So for x <= B, y must be >= B (since y starts at B). So y can be from B to C, but only if x <= y. But wait, x can be as low as A, and y starts at B. So if A <= x <= B, then y must be >= B. So for any x, y can be from B to C, but wait: x can be less than B. So for example, if x is 1, and B is 2, then y can be from 2 onwards.\n\nSo for each x in [A, B], y can be in [B, C], but y must be >= x. Wait, because in the problem statement, it's A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So y is always >= x, because x is <= B and y is >= B. So for x <= B and y >= B, since x <= B and y >= B, x can be less than or equal to y.\n\nSo for each x in [A, B], y can be in [max(B, x), C]. Because y must be >= x and >= B. But since x <= B (because x is up to B), then max(B, x) is B. So y ranges from B to C for each x in [A, B].\n\nWait, that's an important point. So for any x in [A, B], y must be >= B, which is >= x since x <= B. So y can be from B to C, regardless of x",
