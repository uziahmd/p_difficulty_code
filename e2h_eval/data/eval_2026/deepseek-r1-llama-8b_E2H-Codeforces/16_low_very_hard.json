Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a plane with n infinite line roads. Each road is given by the equation a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0. These roads divide the plane into blocks. The home and university are in some blocks. My goal is to find the minimum number of steps needed to move from home's block to the university's block. A step is moving between blocks that share a non-zero boundary segment.\n\nHmm. So each step can be thought of as crossing a road, but not just any crossing—specifically, moving across a road that separates two adjacent blocks.\n\nWait, no. Because the movement is allowed only if the two blocks share a common border of non-zero length. So, for example, two blocks can be separated by an intersection point but still have a common border along a line segment. Like, if two roads cross, their intersection creates four regions. Each adjacent region shares a border that's a segment of one of the roads.\n\nSo, each time I cross a road, I'm moving from one block to another, but only if they are adjacent via a road segment. So, the minimal steps required would correspond to the minimal number of roads that separate the home's and university's regions.\n\nBut how do I model this? It seems like the problem reduces to determining how many lines separate the two points. Because each such line would require a step to cross.\n\nWait, maybe it's exactly the number of lines that the home and university are on opposite sides of. Because each such line contributes one step.\n\nLet me think: For each line, check whether the home and university are on the same side or different sides. If they are on different sides, then that line must be crossed when moving from home to university. So the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of such lines.\n\nYes! Because each such line is a barrier that you have to cross. Since the home and university are in different blocks, each separating line adds a step.\n\nSo the solution is to count the number of lines where home and university lie on opposite sides of the line.\n\nThat makes the problem much simpler than it initially seemed.\n\nSo, the steps to solve:\n\n1. Read home and university coordinates.\n2. For each of the n lines, determine whether home and university are on the same side or different sides.\n3. Count the number of lines where they are on different sides.\n4. Output that count.\n\nBut wait, how do I determine if two points are on the same side of a line?\n\nFor a line ax + by + c = 0, the value f(x, y) = a*x + b*y + c determines which side of the line a point is on. If f(x,y) > 0, it's on one side; if <0, the other. If it's zero, the point is on the line, but the problem says neither home nor university is on any line, so we don't have to handle that case.\n\nSo for each line, compute f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c and f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If f1 and f2 have the same sign (both positive or both negative), then home and university are on the same side of the line. Otherwise, they are on opposite sides, and this line must be crossed.\n\nSo for each of the n lines, check if f1 and f2 have opposite signs. The total count of such lines is the answer.\n\nThat's a straightforward approach.\n\nNow, considering the constraints:\n\nn can be up to 300, which is manageable. For each line, compute f1 and f2, compare signs.\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n\n- All lines have home and university on the same side: then the answer is 0.\n- No lines: but n is at least 1 according to input constraints (n >=1).\nWait, the third line is n, which is 1 <= n <=300.\n\nAnother edge case: lines that are vertical or horizontal, but the method works regardless.\n\nWhat about when a line is something like x=0 (y-axis), and home is (1,2), university is (-1, 2). Then, for this line, f1 = 1*1 + 0*2 + 0 =1, f2= -1*1 +0*2 +0= -1. Signs differ, so this line contributes 1 to the count.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read home (x1, y1)\n- Read university (x2, y2)\n- Read n\n- For each line:\n   a. Read a, b, c\n   b. Compute f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 +c\n   c. Compute f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 +c\n   d. Check if f1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step allows moving between blocks that share a common border segment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The roads are defined by linear equations, and each road divides the plane into regions (blocks). The key insight is that each road can be thought of as a line that separates the plane into two halves. If your home and university are on opposite sides of a road, you must cross that road exactly once when moving from home to university.\n2. **Intuition**: For each road, check if the home and university lie on opposite sides. The number of such roads gives the minimum number of steps required.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Read the coordinates of home and university.\n   - For each road, compute the value of the linear equation at both home and university.\n   - If these values have opposite signs, it means the road separates the two points, so count this road.\n4. **Complexity**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of roads, making it efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    x1 = int(input[idx])\n    y1 = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    x2 = int(input[idx])\n    y2 = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        b = int(input[idx+1])\n        c = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx +=3\n        \n        f1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        f2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if (f1 > 0 and f2 < 0) or (f1 < 0 and f2 > 0):\n            count +=1\n    \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the home and university coordinates, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n- **Checking Each Road**: For each road, it calculates the value of the linear equation at both home and university. If these values have opposite signs, it indicates that the road separates the two points.\n- **Counting Steps**: The number of such separating roads is counted and printed as the result, representing the minimum number of steps needed.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the geometric properties of linear equations and their ability to partition the plane.",
