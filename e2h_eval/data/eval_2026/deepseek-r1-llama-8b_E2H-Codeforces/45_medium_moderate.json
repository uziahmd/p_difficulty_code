There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tennis tournament. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe tournament is knockout, meaning every game eliminates one player. The grid arrangement is not fixed yet, but there's a rule: two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. Also, both must have won all their previous games to reach that point.\n\nThe goal is to find the maximum number of games the winner can participate in. So, I need to model how the winner can progress through the tournament, ensuring that each game adheres to the given rule.\n\nLet's think about small examples first.\n\nFor n=2: Only one game, so the answer is 1.\nFor n=3: The winner plays two games. How? Maybe the winner beats two players in consecutive games. Like, in the first round, they play someone (game 1), then in the next round, they play another (game 2). Since after each game, their number of played games increases by one, the difference with any new opponent is either 0 or 1. So for n=3, the answer is 2.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Each game adds to the count for the winner. So, after each game, the winner has one more game played than before.\n\nWhat about n=4? The sample says the answer is 2. Hmm, why is that? Because when the winner plays in the first round, they might have to face someone who hasn't played yet. For example, if the initial matches are set up as (A vs B) and (C vs D), then A and C win. Then in the next round, A plays C. But since A has 1 game, C has 1. They can play. Suppose A wins. Now, the final is between A and the third player, say B. Wait, no, because in that case, A has 2 games, and B has 0. So they can't play because the difference is 2. That's why it's not possible for the winner to have 3 games in n=4.\n\nSo the maximum is 2.\n\nNow, the task is to find for any n, what is the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nI think the problem can be approached by finding a sequence where the winner's games increase by 1 each time, but also considering the opponents' game counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is similar to building a Fibonacci-like sequence. Because each step, the number of players needed for the next step is based on the sum of certain previous terms.\n\nLet me think differently. The winner starts with 0 games played. To play the first game, they need an opponent with 0 or 1 game. But since it's the first game, the opponent must have 0. So the first game is okay.\n\nAfter the first game, the winner has 1 game. Next, they can face someone with 0 or 1. But wait, the opponents in the tournament must also have played some games. So, for the second game, the opponent could have 0 or 1 games.\n\nWait, maybe the process goes like this:\n\nEach time the winner plays a game, their own game count increases by 1. The opponent must have a game count that is either equal to or one less than the winner's current count.\n\nSo, the winner's game count is k, then the opponent must have either k-1 or k games.\n\nBut how does that translate into the structure of the tournament?\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model the problem by thinking about the minimum number of players required for the winner to play m games.\n\nLet me denote f(m) as the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play m games.\n\nWe need to find the largest m such that f(m) ≤ n.\n\nSo, the question becomes determining f(m) for different m and finding the maximum m where f(m) ≤ n.\n\nHow to compute f(m)?\n\nLet's think recursively. To play m games, the winner must have m opponents. Each opponent must have a game count that allows them to play against the winner.\n\nFor the i-th game (starting from 0), the opponent must have either i-1 or i games.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model it as a binary tree or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of players required for the winner to have m games is the sum of the first m+1 Fibonacci numbers, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: Each time the winner plays a game, the opponent comes from a subtree where each path to the opponent's game count is at most 1 less than the winner's current count.\n\nThis feels like a recursive problem.\n\nLet me think about the base cases:\n\nm = 0: the winner hasn't played any games. Not relevant since n ≥2.\n\nm=1: the winner plays once. So, at least two players are needed. So f(1)=2.\n\nm=2: the winner needs to have played twice. For the first game, the opponent has 0 games. For the second game, the opponent can have 1 game.\n\nBut how many players are needed?\n\nIn the first game, the winner plays against someone (call them A). Then, in the second game, the winner plays against someone else (B), who has just played one game. So, the tournament requires that B has played exactly one game before facing the winner.\n\nBut where does B come from? B must have beaten someone in a previous game. So, for the second game, the winner's opponent B must have played exactly one game, which means that B had to have beaten someone in a prior match.\n\nSo, the minimal structure is:\n\n- Winner (W) plays A in game 1.\n- W then plays B in game 2. B has played one game, so he must have defeated someone else, say C.\n\nThus, the total players needed for m=2 is 3: W, A, B, C? Wait, no. Wait, W plays A, then B plays C in the first round, then W plays B in the second round.\n\nSo, total players: 3 (W, A, B, C)? No, wait, four players. Because W, A, B, C are all participants.\n\nWait, for m=2, the minimal n is 3? Or 4?\n\nWait, no. Because for n=3, the winner can play two games.\n\nWait, let's see: in n=3, the first game is W vs someone (A). W wins, so now W has 1 game. Then, the next game is W vs the third player (B). But B hasn't played any games, so can they play against W?\n\nNo, because W has 1 game, B has 0. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So yes, W can play against B. So in that case, the winner can play two games with n=3.\n\nSo, f(2) is 3.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about n=4, the maximum was 2. So f(2) is 3, and f(3) would require more players.\n\nWait, let's compute f(m) for m=1,2,3, etc.\n\nm=1: f=2.\n\nm=2: f=3.\n\nm=3: What's needed?\n\nTo get three games, the winner's third opponent must have either 2 or 3 games.\n\nWait, the third game: W has played 2 games before. So the opponent can have 1 or 2 games.\n\nWait, no. Because each time, the number of games the opponent has must differ by at most one.\n\nSo for the third game, the winner has 2 games. The opponent must have 1 or 2 games.\n\nIf the opponent has 2 games, that means they have played two matches before facing the winner.\n\nSo, for the third game, the opponent must have two games. So how do they get there?\n\nThey must have played two matches themselves. So, their own two wins must have been against two opponents, each of whom had at most one game.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe we can model this as a Fibonacci sequence.\n\nBecause for each step, the number of players required is the sum of the previous steps.\n\nWait, perhaps f(m) is equal to the sum of f(k) for k from 0 to m-1, plus 1.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nf(1) = 2.\n\nf(2) = f(1) + f(0) + 1? Or perhaps f(2) = f(1) + f(1) - 1?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(m) is the (m+2)th Fibonacci number.\n\nWait, let's compute some values.\n\nm | f(m)\n--- | ---\n1 | 2\n2 | 3\n3 | 5\n4 | 8\n5 | 13\n6 | 21\n\nWait, this looks like the Fibonacci sequence starting from 2,3,5,8,13,...\n\nWhich is the same as the Fibonacci sequence shifted by two positions.\n\nBecause Fibonacci numbers are 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21...\n\nSo f(1)=2=F(4), f(2)=3=F(5), f(3)=5=F(6), etc.\n\nSo, f(m) = F(m+3), where F is the Fibonacci sequence starting with F(1)=1, F(2)=1.\n\nSo, for m=1, F(4) is 3? Wait, no.\n\nWait, maybe I should adjust the indices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(m) is the (m+2)th term in the Fibonacci series starting from 1,1,2,3,5,...\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nm=1: f(1)=2 → which is F(4) in the 1-based sequence where F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, etc.\n\nSo for m=1, f(m)=2=F(3).\n\nm=2: f(m)=3=F(4).\n\nm=3: f(m)=5=F(5).\n\nYes, that seems to fit.\n\nSo f(m) = F(m+2), where F is the Fibonacci sequence with F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, etc.\n\nSo, for a given m, the minimal number of players needed is F(m+2). We need to find the largest m such that F(m+2) ≤ n.\n\nOnce we have that, we can compute the maximum number of games.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute Fibonacci numbers up to a certain point beyond n (since n can be up to 1018).\n\n2. For each n, find the largest m where F(m+2) ≤ n.\n\n3. The result is m.\n\nWait, let's test this with the examples.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=2.\n\nCompute Fibonacci numbers:\n\nF(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5.\n\nWe look for the largest m where F(m+2) <= 2.\n\nF(3)=2, which is <=2. So m+2=3 → m=1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nn=3.\n\nLooking for F(m+2) <=3.\n\nF(4)=3 is the largest. So m+2=4 → m=2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\nn=10.\n\nFind the largest m where F(m+2) <=10.\n\nCompute F(5)=5, F(6)=8, F(7)=13.\n\nSo F(6)=8 <=10, F(7)=13>10. So m+2=6 → m=4. Which matches the sample output of 4.\n\nAnother test case: n=4.\n\nWe need to find the largest m where F(m+2) <=4.\n\nF(5)=5>4, so F(4)=3<=4. So m=2.\n\nWhich aligns with the sample where the answer is 2.\n\nAnother test: n=5.\n\nF(m+2) should be <=5.\n\nF(5)=5, so m=3. So the answer is 3.\n\nSo, the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to compute the Fibonacci numbers up to F(k) until F(k) exceeds 1018* something, but since n is up to 1018, m can be up to what? Let's see.\n\nCompute F(m+2) for m=1: 2.\n\nm=2:3; m=3:5; m=4:8; m=5:13; m=6:21; m=7:34; m=8:55; m=9:89; m=10:144; m=11:233; m=12:377; m=13:610; m=14:987; m=15:1597.\n\nSo for n=1018, F(15)=1597>1018. So the largest m where F(m+2)<=1018 is m=14, since F(16) would be 987+610=1597, which is larger than 1018.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, wait, perhaps I got the order wrong. Let me list out the Fibonacci numbers properly.\n\nLet me start with F(1)=1, F(2)=1, then:\n\nF(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, F(6)=8, F(7)=13, F(8)=21, F(9)=34, F(10)=55, F(11)=89, F(12)=144, F(13)=233, F(14)=377, F(15)=610, F(16)=987, F(17)=1597.\n\nSo for n=1018, we need the largest m where F(m+2) <=1018.\n\nLooking at F(16)=987, which is <=1018.\n\nF(17)=1597>1018.\n\nSo m+2=16 → m=14.\n\nSo for n=1018, the answer is 14.\n\nSo, the plan is to precompute the Fibonacci numbers up to, say, F(30), which is way beyond 1018.\n\nThen, for each n, find the maximum m such that F(m+2) <=n.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\n1. Read n from input.\n\n2. Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to F(k) where F(k) >1018.\n\n3. For each m, compute F(m+2) and check if it's <=n.\n\n4. Find the largest m where this holds.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe can generate the Fibonacci sequence, and for each n, iterate m from 1 upwards, checking if F(m+2) <=n. Once we find that F(m+2) exceeds n, the previous m is the maximum.\n\nBut since m can be up to about 40 for n=1018, this is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, precompute all possible F(m+2) up to a large enough number, then for a given n, perform a binary search over the precomputed list to find the largest m.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, generate a list of Fibonacci numbers, starting from F(1)=1, F(2)=1, and so on, until F(k) exceeds 1e6 or something.\n\nThen, for a given n, we want the largest m where F(m+2) <=n.\n\nSo, the list will have F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, ..., F(k) for k up to 17 (as F(17)=1597).\n\nSo, for each n, iterate m from 1, compute F(m+2), and keep track of the largest m where F(m+2) <=n.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\n- Precompute a list fib where fib[i] = F(i) with F(1)=1, F(2)=1.\n\n- For a given n, initialize max_games =0.\n\n- For m in 1,2,... until fib[m+2] >n:\n\n   if fib[m+2] <=n:\n\n      max_games = m\n\n   else:\n\n      break\n\nSo, that's the plan.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, generate the Fibonacci sequence:\n\nfib = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    if next > 2 * 1e6:  # just a safe upper limit\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(next)\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to precompute up to F(20) which is 6765, which is way beyond 1018.\n\nSo, code:\n\nfib = [1, 1]\n\nfor i in range(3, 30):\n\n    fib.append(fib[i-1] + fib[i-2])\n\nSo, now fib[3] is 2, fib[4]=3, etc.\n\nBut in our case, F(1) is 1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, etc.\n\nSo, for the problem, F(m+2) is the value we're interested in.\n\nSo, for m=1, F(3)=2.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfib = [1, 1]  # F(1) and F(2)\n\ncurrent_fib = 2  # F(3)\n\nfib.append(current_fib)\n\nfor i in range(4, 50):  # arbitrary large index\n\n    next_fib = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    fib.append(next_fib)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to build the list correctly.\n\nLet me re-calculate:\n\nWe can have a list where fib[i] represents F(i).\n\nSo, for i=1:1, i=2:1, i=3:2, etc.\n\nSo, to generate this list:\n\nfib = []\n\na, b = 1, 1\n\nfib.append(a)\n\nfib.append(b)\n\nwhile True:\n\n    c = a + b\n\n    if c > 2 * 10**6:\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(c)\n\n    a, b = b, c\n\nSo, for i=3, fib[3] is 2, etc.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfib = [1, 1]\n\na, b = 1, 1\n\nfib.append(a)\n\nfib.append(b)\n\nwhile True:\n\n    c = a + b\n\n    if c > 2e6:\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(c)\n\n    a, b = b, c\n\nWait, no. Because initially, fib is [1,1]. Then a=1, b=1. Compute c=2, append. Now fib is [1,1,2], then a becomes 1, b becomes 2.\n\nNext c=3, append. Now fib is [1,1,2,3], a=2, b=3.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, now, for each m, we can calculate F(m+2) as fib[m+2].\n\nWait, but for m=1, m+2=3. So fib[3] is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in the code, for a given n, we need to find the largest m where fib[m+2] <=n.\n\nWait, but fib is a list where fib[i] is F(i), starting from 1 at index 1.\n\nSo, for m starting from 1, m+2 is 3,4,5,... So, for m=1, check fib[3], for m=2, check fib[4], etc.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nmax_m = 0\n\nfor m in range(1, 100):  # a high enough number\n\n    required = fib[m+2]\n\n    if required <=n:\n\n        max_m = m\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nprint(max_m)\n\nWait, but what if m+2 exceeds the length of fib? Because fib was precomputed up to, say, 50 terms, but for m=48, m+2=50, which may be beyond.\n\nSo, in the loop, for each m, we need to check whether m+2 is within the fib list.\n\nWait, perhaps the precomputed fib can be extended until, say, 1e6.\n\nAlternatively, during the loop, we can check whether m+2 is beyond the current fib length.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can be adjusted as follows:\n\nprecompute fib as far as possible.\n\nthen, for m starting from 1, while m+2 is within the fib list:\n\ncheck if fib[m+2] <=n.\n\nif yes, set max_m=m.\n\nelse, break.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nfib = [1, 1]  # F(1) and F(2)\n\na, b = 1, 1\n\nfib.append(a)\n\nfib.append(b)\n\nwhile True:\n\n    c = a + b\n\n    fib.append(c)\n\n    if c > 2e6:\n\n        break\n\n    a, b = b, c\n\nmax_games = 0\n\nfor m in range(1, 1000):\n\n    idx = m + 2\n\n    if idx >= len(fib):\n\n        break\n\n    if fib[idx] <= n:\n\n        max_games = m\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nprint(max_games)\n\nWait, but for m=1, idx=3.\n\nFor m=14, idx=16.\n\nIf the fib list is built up to 16, which it is, since F(16)=987.\n\nSo for n=1018, m=14.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the code with sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n2 3 4 10 → outputs 1, 2, 2,4.\n\nLet's see:\n\nn=2:\n\nCheck for m=1: fib[3]=2 <=2 → max_games=1.\n\nm=2: fib[4]=3>2 → break. So output is 1.\n\nn=3:\n\nm=1: 2<=3 → yes. max=1.\n\nm=2: fib[4]=3 <=3 → max=2.\n\nm=3: fib[5]=5>3 → break. So output 2.\n\nn=4:\n\nm=1:2<=4 → yes.\n\nm=2:3<=4 → yes.\n\nm=3:5>4 → break. So output is 2.\n\nn=10:\n\nm=1:2<=10 → yes.\n\nm=2:3<=10 → yes.\n\nm=3:5<=10 → yes.\n\nm=4:8<=10 → yes.\n\nm=5: fib[7]=13>10 → break. So max is 4.\n\nWhich matches the samples.\n\nAnother test case: n=5.\n\nm=1:2<=5 → yes.\n\nm=2:3<=5 → yes.\n\nm=3:5<=5 → yes.\n\nm=4:8>5 → break. So max is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test: n=987.\n\nWe need to find m where fib[m+2] <=987.\n\nfib[15]=610, fib[16]=987.\n\nSo for m=14: m+2=16 → fib[16]=987 <=987 → yes.\n\nm=15: m+2=17 → fib[17]=1597>987 → no. So max is 14.\n\nAnother test case: n=987.\n\nOutput is 14.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to read a single integer n and print the maximum number of games.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, write the Python code:\n\nRead n, generate the fib list, then find the maximum m.\n\nSo, here's the code:\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given that two players can only face each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the problem can be modeled using Fibonacci numbers. The minimal number of players required for the winner to play `m` games follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play `m` games is the `(m + 2)`-th Fibonacci number.\n\nThe steps to solve the problem are as follows:\n1. Precompute Fibonacci numbers up to a sufficiently large value.\n2. For a given number of players `n`, find the largest `m` such that the `(m + 2)`-th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\n\n# Precompute Fibonacci numbers up to a sufficient size\nfib = [1, 1]  # F(1) and F(2)\na, b = 1, 1\nfib.append(a)\nfib.append(b)\n\nwhile True:\n    c = a + b\n    fib.append(c)\n    if c > 2 * 10**6:  # Stop when it's large enough\n        break\n    a, b = b, c\n\nmax_games = 0\nfor m in range(1, 1000):  # A sufficiently large upper limit for m\n    idx = m + 2\n    if idx >= len(fib):\n        break\n    if fib[idx] <= n:\n        max_games = m\n    else:\n        break\n\nprint(max_games)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Fibonacci Numbers**: We generate a list of Fibonacci numbers starting from `F(1) = 1` and `F(2) = 1`. This list is built until the numbers exceed a safe upper limit (e.g., `2 * 10^6`).\n2. **Determine Maximum Games**: For the given `n`, iterate through possible values of `m` starting from 1. For each `m`, check if the `(m + 2)`-th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to `n`.
