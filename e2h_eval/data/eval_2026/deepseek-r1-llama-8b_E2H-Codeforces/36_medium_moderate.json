The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about radio towers in towns. There are n+2 towns, numbered from 0 to n+1. We build a tower in each town 1 to n with probability 1/2 each, independently. Then, we assign each built tower a signal power between 1 and n. The goal is to set these powers such that:\n\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal.\n2. Each of the towns 1 to n gets exactly one signal.\n\nWe need to compute the probability of being able to do this, modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm. So the probability is the number of valid configurations divided by the total possible configurations, which is (2^n). Because each tower is built or not with probability 1/2, so 2^n possibilities.\n\nBut how to count the valid configurations?\n\nLet me think about what makes a configuration valid.\n\nEach town from 1 to n must be covered exactly once. So the coverage regions of the towers must form a partition of the towns 1 to n, without overlapping, and without leaving any town uncovered.\n\nAlso, towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered. So for town 0, its left neighbor is town 1. So any tower in town 1 cannot have a signal power that covers town 0. So p for town 1 must be <= 1, because |0-1| < p implies p > 1, but that would cover town 0. So town 1's p must be 1 if it's built.\n\nWait, let's see: |c - i| < p. So for town 0, c=0, i=1. So |0-1|=1. So p must be >1 for it to cover 0. But we don't want that. So the tower in town 1 can have p=1, which doesn't cover 0. So if a tower is built in town 1, its p must be 1.\n\nSimilarly, for town n, the right neighbor is n+1. So if a tower is built in town n, its p must be 1, otherwise it would cover n+1.\n\nSo first condition: If town 1 has a tower, it must be set to p=1. Similarly for town n.\n\nWhat about the other towns?\n\nI think the valid configurations are exactly those where the built towers form a non-overlapping chain where each tower's coverage interval is exactly one town. Or perhaps something like a tiling of the line.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the problem as choosing a set S of built towers, and then checking whether there's a way to assign p_i such that the coverage intervals don't overlap and exactly cover 1..n, and also ensure that 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\nSo for each subset S of {1, 2, ..., n}, we need to determine if it's possible to assign p_i's so that:\n\n- For each i in S, the coverage interval [i - p_i + 1, i + p_i - 1] must be entirely within 1..n, and not include 0 or n+1.\n\n- The union of all coverage intervals is exactly {1, 2, ..., n}.\n\n- All coverage intervals are disjoint.\n\nSo, for each possible subset S, we need to check if such an assignment exists. But n can be up to 2e5, so checking each subset is impossible.\n\nThus, we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative idea: The problem resembles tiling or exact covering problems. Maybe it's similar to domino tiling, where each \"tile\" is of a certain length, and they must cover exactly without overlaps.\n\nWait, maybe the structure of the valid subsets S is that each tower in S must have a coverage interval that is exactly one unit, except for some that cover more. Wait, no—p_i can be larger than 1, as long as their coverage doesn't reach 0 or n+1.\n\nWait, perhaps the arrangement must form a non-overlapping sequence of intervals, each of which is exactly length 2p_i -1. And all together, they cover 1..n exactly.\n\nThis feels similar to a partitioning of the towns into segments, each segment covered by exactly one tower.\n\nLet me think about the possible ways to assign p_i's.\n\nLet's model each tower's coverage as an interval. For a tower at position i with power p, the coverage is [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)] = [i - p +1, i + p -1]. But since the towns are 1..n, this interval must be entirely within that range.\n\nSo for i=1, the coverage is [1 - p +1, 1 + p -1] = [2 -p, p]. But since town 0 is not allowed to be covered, 2-p must be >=1. So 2-p >=1 => p <=1. So p can only be 1. So if town 1 is built, it must have p=1, which covers town 1 only.\n\nSimilarly, for i=n, the coverage is [n - p +1, n + p -1]. This must not include n+1, so n + p -1 <=n => p <=1. So again, p must be 1. So if town n is built, it must have p=1, covering only itself.\n\nSo, the ends (town 1 and n) must have p=1 if they are present in S.\n\nWhat about the middle towns?\n\nFor town i (2 <=i <=n-1), if it's built, p can be 1 or more, as long as the coverage doesn't reach 0 or n+1.\n\nWait, but for a tower in i=2, p=2 would cover towns 1,2,3. But town 1 is already covered if it's built with p=1. So overlapping is bad.\n\nSo, the intervals must not overlap. So for any two towers in S, their coverage intervals must not overlap.\n\nMoreover, the entire 1..n must be covered exactly once.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding all subsets S where the intervals assigned to each tower in S are non-overlapping, exactly cover 1..n, and the first and last towers (if present) have p=1.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a pattern or recurrence relation here.\n\nLet me try small examples.\n\nExample 1: n=1.\n\nPossible subsets S: only {1} or empty.\n\nIf S is empty: no towers. Then, towns 1 must not be covered. But according to the constraints, each town 1..n must be covered exactly once. So if n=1 and S is empty, then town 1 is not covered. So invalid.\n\nIf S is {1}: it must have p=1. Coverage is town 1. So this is valid.\n\nSo the valid subsets are only {1}. The probability is 1/2.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, n=2, the output is 1/4. Hmm, let's see.\n\nWait the sample says when n=2, the probability is 1/4. So when n=2, the valid subsets are those where both 1 and 2 are built. Because if you have only 1, it can't cover 2, and if you have only 2, it can't cover 1.\n\nWait no, because if 1 is built with p=1, it covers 1, and 2 is built with p=2, which would cover 1,2,3. But town 3 is n+1=3, which is not allowed. So p=2 is invalid for town 2.\n\nWait, in the example, when n=2 and S={2}, can we assign p=1? Then it covers only 2. So town 1 is not covered. So that's invalid. So the only valid subset is when both 1 and 2 are built, each with p=1. So the subset {1,2} is the only valid one.\n\nHence, the probability is 1/(2^2) = 1/4.\n\nSo for n=2, the answer is 1/4.\n\nSo the problem is to find all subsets S where:\n\n- If 1 is in S, p=1.\n\n- If n is in S, p=1.\n\n- The intervals assigned to S's towers do not overlap and exactly cover 1..n.\n\nHow can we model this?\n\nPerhaps it's similar to tiling the line with certain blocks, where each block is of size 1 (for the end points) or larger.\n\nWait, another thought: the problem requires that the entire set 1..n is covered exactly once. So the sum of the lengths of the intervals (each 2p_i -1) must equal n.\n\nBecause each interval contributes 2p_i -1 towns, and all together they cover n towns.\n\nSo sum_{i in S} (2p_i -1) = n.\n\nBut each p_i is at least 1, so each term is at least 1. So sum(2p_i -1) = sum(2p_i) - |S| = n.\n\nSo 2*sum(p_i) - |S| = n.\n\nWhich rearranges to sum(p_i) = (n + |S|)/2.\n\nSince sum(p_i) must be an integer, (n + |S|) must be even. So |S| must have the same parity as n.\n\nSo |S| is congruent to n mod 2.\n\nHmm, that's a useful condition.\n\nAnother thing: the intervals must not overlap, and must exactly cover 1..n.\n\nSo this is similar to placing non-overlapping intervals on the line, each starting and ending at specific points, covering exactly the required number of towns.\n\nThis structure reminds me of the Fibonacci sequence, as it often appears in tiling problems.\n\nLet me consider the dynamic programming approach.\n\nLet f[k] be the number of valid subsets for the first k towns.\n\nWe can think recursively. For each position i, we can decide whether to place a tower there or not.\n\nWait, but the placement depends on the previous choices. For example, if I place a tower at i with p=1, then i-1 must have been covered by the previous tower. Or if I place a tower at i with p>1, then the previous tower must end before i-p+1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model f[k] as the number of ways to arrange towers for the first k towns.\n\nLet me try to define f[k] as the number of valid configurations for the first k towns.\n\nBase cases:\n\nf[0] = 1 (no towns to cover, but since our problem starts at 1, this might not apply directly).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to index f[k] as the number of ways to cover the first k towns. So for k=0, f[0] = 1 (empty configuration). For k=1, f[1] is 1 (only tower 1 with p=1).\n\nFor k=2, the valid configurations are:\n\nEither two towers at 1 and 2, each with p=1. Or one tower at 2 with p=2, but then it covers 1 and 2. But wait, town 1 is covered by tower 2's p=2, but then town 1 isn't covered by any other tower. So that's allowed.\n\nWait, for n=2:\n\nCase 1: Both 1 and 2 are built. Assign p=1 to each. So coverage is 1 and 2. Valid.\n\nCase 2: Only 2 is built. Assign p=2. Coverage is 1,2,3. But 3 is n+1=3, which is invalid. So this is not allowed.\n\nSo only case 1 is valid. Hence, for n=2, the count is 1.\n\nWait, but earlier analysis said that the count is 1 for n=2. But wait, no—what about other possibilities?\n\nWait, what if 1 is not built, but 2 is built with p=1. Then coverage is 2 only. Town 1 is not covered. So that's invalid.\n\nSo yes, only when both are built and each has p=1.\n\nSo for n=2, f[2] = 1.\n\nWait, but let me think about the general approach.\n\nWhen adding the k-th town, how can it be covered?\n\nOption 1: Place a tower at k with p=1. Then, the previous town (k-1) must be covered by a tower whose coverage includes k-1. So the previous tower could be at k-1 with p=1, or a tower further back that covers up to k-1.\n\nOption 2: Place a tower at k with p>1. Then, the coverage starts at k - (p-1) and ends at k + (p-1) -1 = k + p-2. But since we're building for the first k towns, the coverage must not extend beyond k. So p must be such that k - (p-1) >=1. Also, the coverage interval must not overlap with any previous ones.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to model this using a DP approach where f[k] represents the number of valid ways to cover the first k towns.\n\nFor each k, f[k] can be computed based on f[j], where j is the position before the current coverage ends.\n\nFor example, if I place a tower at position k with p=1, then the previous coverage must end at k-1. So the number of ways is f[k-1].\n\nAlternatively, if I place a tower at position k with p=2, then it covers positions k-1 and k. So the previous coverage must end at k-2. The number of ways is f[k-2].\n\nSimilarly, placing a tower with p=3 would require the previous coverage to end at k-3, and so on.\n\nBut wait, the maximum p for a tower at k is such that k - (p-1) >= 1. So p can be from 1 to k.\n\nWait, but if p is 2, then the coverage is k-1 and k. So to add this, the previous coverage must end at k-2, because the current tower covers k-1 and k.\n\nSo for each k, the transitions are:\n\nf[k] = f[k-1] * 1 (placing p=1) + f[k-2] * 1 (placing p=2) + ... + f[0] *1 (placing p=k).\n\nWait, but that's O(n^2), which is too slow for n=2e5.\n\nHmm, so this approach is not feasible.\n\nWe need a way to compute f[n] efficiently, likely using matrix exponentiation or some other method to find a closed-form formula or a linear recurrence that can be computed quickly.\n\nLet me think about the recurrence.\n\nLooking at small values:\n\nn=1: f[1]=1\n\nn=2: f[2] = f[1] + f[0] = 1 + 1 = 2. Wait, but earlier analysis for n=2 says only 1 valid subset. So perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. For n=2, according to the DP approach, the number of valid subsets is 2. But earlier analysis says only 1.\n\nWait, maybe the DP approach is considering different options, but some of them are invalid because the coverage extends beyond the allowed area.\n\nAh! Right, because when placing a tower with p>1, its coverage may extend beyond the current k. For example, in n=2, if I place a tower at 2 with p=2, it covers 1 and 2 and 3. But 3 is beyond n=2, so it's invalid.\n\nSo the DP approach as I thought would include invalid configurations.\n\nSo I need to modify the transition to account for the fact that placing a tower with p>1 may cause the coverage to extend beyond the current k, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, but for a tower at position k with p, the coverage is [k - (p-1), k + (p-1) -1] = [k - p +1, k + p -2]. So for this interval to be entirely within 1..n, when we are considering the first k towns, the interval must be within 1..k.\n\nWait, perhaps the DP approach needs to consider the maximum position covered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is similar to tiling where each tile can be of certain lengths, but not exceeding the current position.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct recurrence is that f[k] is the sum of f[j] for j in the range [k - m, k-1], where m is the maximum possible coverage from a single tower.\n\nWait, but the maximum coverage for a tower at position j is 2*p_j -1, but p_j can vary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is that for each position i, when we place a tower, the coverage is [i - (p-1), i + (p-1) -1], which must fit within 1..k.\n\nSo for the current k, the coverage can be any j where j = i - (p-1) and j >=1.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to model f[k] as the number of ways to cover the first k towns, and for each k, the last tower can be placed at position i, where i can be from 1 to k, and p is chosen such that the coverage does not extend beyond k.\n\nHmm, but this seems tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the problem is equivalent to counting the number of subsets S such that the towers form a valid non-overlapping coverage, with the ends possibly having p=1.\n\nThis is similar to the problem of counting the number of independent sets on a certain graph, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each node represents a town, and edges represent the possibility that two towns cannot both have a tower (because their coverage would overlap). Then, the problem reduces to counting the number of independent sets in this graph that form a vertex cover. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is similar to arranging non-overlapping intervals, each of which is centered at a tower, and each interval's length is 2p_i -1.\n\nBut given that each interval can vary in length, this complicates things.\n\nLet me try to find a recurrence relation.\n\nSuppose f[k] is the number of valid configurations for the first k towns.\n\nTo build f[k], consider the last tower placed. The last tower could be placed at position i, and have a coverage that ends at k.\n\nSo for each i, the last tower's coverage must end exactly at k.\n\nThe coverage of a tower at i is [i - p + 1, i + p -1]. Since it's the last tower, the coverage must end at k.\n\nSo, i + p -1 = k.\n\nAlso, the coverage must not overlap with any previous coverage.\n\nSo the start of the coverage is s = i - p +1.\n\nBut s must be >=1, and s must be after the end of the previous coverage.\n\nWait, perhaps for the last tower, the coverage is [s, k], where s = i - p +1.\n\nAnd the previous coverage must end at s-1.\n\nSo, for each possible s, where 1 <= s <=k, we can find i and p such that i + p -1 =k, and i -p +1 =s.\n\nThen, the number of ways to cover up to k is the sum over all possible s of f[s-1], multiplied by the number of ways to choose i and p for that s.\n\nBut how many (i,p) pairs satisfy i + p-1 =k and i -p +1 =s?\n\nAdding the two equations:\n\ni + p -1 + i -p +1 = s +k → 2i = s +k → i=(s +k)/2.\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n\n(i + p -1) - (i -p +1) =k -s → 2p -2 =k -s → p=(k -s +2)/2.\n\nSo for p to be integer, (k-s+2) must be even.\n\nSo s can be any value such that s <=k, s >=1, and (k-s+2) is even.\n\nAlso, i must be an integer between 1 and k.\n\nSo i=(s +k)/2 must be >=1 and <=k.\n\nSo s +k must be even, and s <=k.\n\nWait, let me substitute s = i -p +1.\n\nWe have s = i - ( (k -s +2)/2 ) +1.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since i and p must be integers, for a given s, i is (s +k)/2, p is (k -s +2)/2.\n\nSo for i to be integer, s +k must be even, and similarly for p.\n\nSo, for each possible s in 1..k, such that s and k have the same parity (since s +k must be even), and p must be positive.\n\nWait, p is (k -s +2)/2. Since p must be at least 1, (k -s +2) >=2 → s <=k.\n\nWhich is already satisfied.\n\nSo for each s in 1..k where s <=k and s and k have the same parity, we can have a valid (i,p).\n\nBut for each such s, the number of ways is f[s-1], because the previous coverage ends at s-1.\n\nSo f[k] = sum_{s} f[s-1], where s ranges over 1..k and s ≡k mod 2.\n\nWait, that's a crucial observation.\n\nSo for each k, f[k] is the sum of f[s-1] for s in 1..k, s ≡k mod 2.\n\nBecause s and k must have the same parity for i to be integer.\n\nWait, let's test this for small n.\n\nn=1: f[1] = sum of s where s≡1 mod 2 and s<=1. So s can be 1.\n\nSo f[1] = f[0] =1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nn=2: f[2] = sum of s where s≡0 mod 2 and s<=2. So s=2.\n\nSo f[2] =f[1]=1.\n\nWhich aligns with earlier analysis that f[2]=1.\n\nBut wait, wait: according to this, f[2] is 1. But according to the sample input, when n=2, the probability is 1/4. So the count is 1.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWhat about n=3?\n\nf[3] is the sum of s where s≡1 mod 2 and s<=3.\n\nSo s=1,3.\n\nSo f[3] = f[0] + f[2] =1 +1=2.\n\nSo the count is 2.\n\nSo for n=3, the number of valid subsets is 2.\n\nLet me check what those subsets are.\n\nPossible subsets:\n\n1. Towers at 1,2,3: Assign p=1 to all. Coverage is 1,2,3. Valid.\n\n2. Towers at 2: p=2. Coverage is 1,2,3. But n=3, so 3 is allowed. So this is valid.\n\nSo yes, two subsets.\n\nSo the count is 2.\n\nSo f[3]=2.\n\nAnother example: n=4.\n\nf[4] = sum of s where s ≡0 mod 2, s<=4. So s=2,4.\n\nSo f[4] = f[1] + f[3] =1 + 2=3.\n\nSo for n=4, there are 3 valid subsets.\n\nWhat are they?\n\n1. All four towns: p=1 each.\n\n2. Towers at 2 and 4. Assign p=2 to 2 (covers 1,2,3), p=1 to 4 (covers 4). So coverage is 1,2,3,4. Valid.\n\n3. Towers at 3: p=2. Covers 2,3,4. But then town 1 is not covered. So this is invalid. Wait, no.\n\nWait, if I have only tower 3 with p=2, coverage is 2,3,4. Town 1 is not covered. So that's invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps another option: towers at 1 and 3. Assign p=1 to 1, p=2 to 3. Coverage is 1, 2,3,4. Valid.\n\nSo that's another subset.\n\nSo for n=4, the valid subsets are:\n\na) {1,2,3,4}: p=1 each.\n\nb) {2,4}: p=2 for 2, p=1 for 4.\n\nc) {1,3}: p=1 for 1, p=2 for 3.\n\nSo three subsets, which matches f[4]=3.\n\nSo the recurrence seems correct.\n\nThus, the recurrence is f[k] = sum_{s=1, s<=k, s ≡k mod 2} f[s-1].\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently for large n up to 2e5?\n\nComputing this recurrence naively would be O(n^2), which is too slow.\n\nWe need to find a way to express f[k] in terms of f[k-1] and f[k-2], etc., perhaps leading to a linear recurrence.\n\nLooking at the recurrence for even and odd k:\n\nLet me separate the cases based on k being even or odd.\n\nLet me denote:\n\ng[k] = f[2k]\n\nh[k] = f[2k-1]\n\nSo for even k=2m:\n\nf[2m] = sum of s where s is even and s <=2m. So s=2,4,...,2m.\n\nEach term is f[s-1] = f[1], f[3], ..., f[2m-1}.\n\nSo f[2m] = h[1] + h[2] + ... + h[m}\n\nSimilarly, for odd k=2m+1:\n\nf[2m+1} = sum of s where s is odd and s <=2m+1. So s=1,3,...,2m+1.\n\nEach term is f[s-1}=f[0], f[2}, ..., f[2m}.\n\nSo f[2m+1} = g[1] + g[2} + ... +g[m}.\n\nWait, but what are g and h in terms of f.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write f[k] in terms of f[k-1] and f[k-2}.\n\nWait, for even k=2m:\n\nf[2m] = sum_{i=1 to m} f[2i-1}.\n\nFor odd k=2m+1:\n\nf[2m+1} = sum_{i=1 to m+1} f[2i}.\n\nHmm, but this still seems a bit abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a relation between f[k] and f[k-1}, f[k-2}, etc.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor even k=2m:\n\nf[2m} = f[2m-1} + f[2m-2}.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWait, for k=2m, the sum is over even s up to 2m. So s=2,4,...,2m.\n\nEach s is 2i, and i runs from 1 to m.\n\nSo f[2m} = sum_{i=1 to m} f[2i -1}.\n\nSimilarly, for k=2m+1:\n\nf[2m+1} = sum_{i=1 to m+1} f[2i}.\n\nSo perhaps the recurrence can be written as:\n\nf[2m} = f[2m-1} + f[2m-2}.\n\nSimilarly, f[2m+1} = f[2m} + f[2m-1}.\n\nWait, let's test this with our earlier results.\n\nFor m=1:\n\nf[2} = f[1} + f[0} =1 +1=2. But earlier calculation shows f[2}=1. So this doesn't hold.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, for k=2m, the sum is over s even up to 2m. So for m=1, s=2: sum is f[1}.\n\nBut according to the earlier recurrence, f[2}= sum s even up to 2: s=2 → f[1}=1.\n\nSo for m=1, f[2}=1.\n\nBut according to the proposed recurrence, f[2m} = f[2m-1} + f[2m-2}.\n\nFor m=1, 2m=2: f[2}=f[1} + f[0}=1+1=2. Which contradicts.\n\nSo that approach is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's compute f[k] for a few values and see if a pattern emerges.\n\nn : f[n]\n\n1:1\n\n2:1\n\n3:2\n\n4:3\n\n5: ?\n\nLet me compute f[5}.\n\nf[5} is the sum of s where s is odd and <=5. So s=1,3,5.\n\nEach term is f[s-1}=f[0}, f[2}, f[4}.\n\nSo f[5}=1 +1 +3=5.\n\nSo f[5}=5.\n\nn=5: f[5}=5.\n\nSimilarly, for n=6:\n\nf[6}= sum of s even up to 6: s=2,4,6.\n\nEach term is f[1}, f[3}, f[5} → 1+2+5=8.\n\nSo f[6}=8.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nn | f(n)\n\n1:1\n\n2:1\n\n3:2\n\n4:3\n\n5:5\n\n6:8\n\nWait, looking at this, it looks like the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nIndeed, 1,1,2,3,5,8... which is the Fibonacci numbers starting from f(1)=1, f(2}=1.\n\nSo for n=1: f=1\n\nn=2: f=1\n\nn=3: f=2\n\nn=4:3\n\nn=5:5\n\nn=6:8\n\nYes, this seems to follow the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nSo the hypothesis is that f(n) is the (n)th Fibonacci number, but offset.\n\nWait, the Fibonacci sequence is typically defined as F(1)=1, F(2}=1, F(3}=2, etc.\n\nIn our case, f(n) is F(n), where F is the standard Fibonacci.\n\nSo for n=1, f=1=F(1).\n\nn=2: f=1=F(2).\n\nn=3: f=2=F(3).\n\nn=4:3=F(4).\n\nn=5:5=F(5).\n\nn=6:8=F(6}.\n\nSo yes, the pattern holds.\n\nThus, the number of valid subsets is the nth Fibonacci number.\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing the nth Fibonacci number, where F(1}=1, F(2}=1, F(3}=2, etc.\n\nNow, the probability is (F(n)) / (2^n), modulo 998244353.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute F(n), the nth Fibonacci number, where F(1}=1, F(2}=1, F(3}=2, etc.\n\n2. Compute the modular inverse of 2^n modulo 998244353.\n\n3. Multiply F(n) by the inverse of 2^n modulo 998244353.\n\nSo the result is (F(n) * inv(2^n)) mod MOD.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute F(n) efficiently for n up to 2e5.\n\nWe can precompute the Fibonacci numbers modulo MOD using a loop.\n\nSimilarly, we can compute 2^n modulo MOD, and then compute its inverse.\n\nCompute inv_2n = pow(2, n, MOD)'s inverse.\n\nBut wait, since MOD is 998244353, which is a prime, the inverse can be computed as pow(2, MOD-2 - n, MOD)? No, wait, 2^n's inverse is pow(2, MOD-2, MOD)^n mod MOD.\n\nBecause Fermat's little theorem says that for a prime MOD, a^(MOD-2) ≡ a^{-1} mod MOD. So 2^{-1} mod MOD is 499122177.\n\nSo 2^n mod MOD can be computed as pow(2, n, MOD), and its inverse is pow(2, MOD-2, MOD)^n mod MOD.\n\nBut wait, 2^n mod MOD is x. Then, x^{-1} mod MOD is (x^{MOD-2}) mod MOD.\n\nSo, to compute x^{-1}, it's pow(x, MOD-2, MOD).\n\nSo for 2^n, its inverse is pow(2, n * (MOD-2), MOD)?\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because 2^n mod MOD is x, and x^{-1} is pow(x, MOD-2, MOD).\n\nSo, for the denominator 2^n, the inverse is pow(2, n, MOD) raised to the power MOD-2 modulo MOD.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nCompute F(n) mod MOD.\n\nCompute denom = 2^n mod MOD.\n\nCompute inv_denom = pow(denom, MOD-2, MOD).\n\nResult = (F(n) * inv_denom) % MOD.\n\nPrint result.\n\nNow, for n=1, F(n)=1, denom=2, inv_denom=499122177.\n\n1 * 499122177 mod MOD is 499122177, but wait the sample input for n=2 has output 748683265, which is 1/4 mod MOD.\n\nWait, let's confirm:\n\nF(2)=1.\n\ndenom=2^2=4.\n\ninv_denom=748683265.\n\nSo 1 * 748683265 mod MOD is 748683265, which matches the sample.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the plan is correct.\n\nSo now, the code.\n\nImplement the Fibonacci function:\n\nWe can compute F(n) mod MOD iteratively.\n\nHandle the base cases:\n\nif n ==0: F(0)=0.\n\nn=1: F(1)=1.\n\nn=2: F(2}=1.\n\netc.\n\nBut according to our earlier analysis, for n>=1, F(n) is as per the standard Fibonacci.\n\nSo code:\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\nread n.\n\nif n ==0: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute fib up to n.\n\nfib = [0]*(n+1)\n\nfib[0] =0\n\nfib[1}=1\n\nfib[2}=1\n\nfor i in 2 to n-1:\n\nfib[i] = (fib[i-1] + fib[i-2}) % MOD\n\nWait, but for n=1, fib[1}=1.\n\nBut for n=2, fib[2}=1.\n\nYes.\n\nOnce we have fib[n}, compute denom = pow(2, n, MOD).\n\ninv_denom = pow(denom, MOD-2, MOD).\n\nresult = (fib[n] * inv_denom) % MOD.\n\nPrint result.\n\nTesting sample input:\n\nSample 1: n=2.\n\nfib[2}=1.\n\ndenom=4.\n\ninv_denom=748683265.\n\n1 * 748683265 mod MOD is 748683265 → matches sample.\n\nSample 2: n=3.\n\nfib[3}=2.\n\ndenom=8.\n\ninv_denom=124780544.\n\n2 * 124780544 mod MOD is 249561088.\n\nWait, but the sample output for n=3 is 748683265.\n\nWait, no, wait the sample output is given as:\n\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\nWhich is for n=2,3,5,200000.\n\nWait, for n=3, the sample output is 748683265.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I messed up the Fibonacci numbering.\n\nWait, perhaps my definition is off by one.\n\nWait, for n=1, the count is 1, which is F(1}.\n\nn=2: count is 1 → F(2}.\n\nn=3: count is 2 → F(3}.\n\nn=4:3 →F(4}.\n\nn=5:5 →F(5}.\n\nBut according to the sample input for n=3, the output is 748683265.\n\nLet me compute 2 / 8 mod MOD.\n\n2/8 = 1/4. 1/4 mod MOD is 748683265.\n\nSo 2 * inv(8) mod MOD is 748683265.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo for n=3, the code computes fib[3}=2, denom=8, inv_denom=748683265.\n\n2 * 748683265 mod MOD is 748683265 *2 mod MOD.\n\n748683265 *2 = 1497366530.\n\nModulo 998244353: 1497366530 - 1 *998244353 = 499122177.\n\nBut 499122177 is the inverse of 2 mod MOD.\n\nWait, but 748683265 is 1/4 mod MOD.\n\nSo 2 * (1/4) = 1/2 mod MOD.\n\nBut 748683265 is 1/4, 2 * 748683265 = 1/2.\n\nWhich is 499122177 mod MOD.\n\nBut sample output for n=3 is 748",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that we can set the signal powers of radio towers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, while each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal. This probability should be computed modulo 998244353.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be approached by recognizing that the valid configurations of towers form a structure similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, the number of valid configurations for `n` towns is given by the `n`-th Fibonacci number. \n\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The number of valid configurations for `n` towns is the `n`-th Fibonacci number, where `F(1) = 1`, `F(2) = 1`, and `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)` for `n > 2`.\n2. **Probability Calculation**: The probability is the ratio of the number of valid configurations (Fibonacci number) to the total number of possible configurations (which is `2^n`). Using modular arithmetic, we compute this probability modulo 998244353.\n3. **Modular Inverse**: To handle division in modular arithmetic, we compute the modular inverse of `2^n` using Fermat's Little Theorem.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\nn = int(input())\nif n == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Compute Fibonacci numbers up to n\n    fib = [0] * (n + 1)\n    fib[1] = 1\n    if n >= 2:\n        fib[2] = 1\n    for i in range(3, n + 1):\n        fib[i] = (fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]) % MOD\n    \n    # Compute 2^n mod MOD\n    denom = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    # Compute inverse of denom\n    inv_denom = pow(denom, MOD - 2, MOD)\n    # Result is (fib[n] * inv_denom) mod MOD\n    result = (fib[n] * inv_denom) % MOD\n    print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fibonacci Calculation**: We precompute the Fibonacci sequence up to `n` using an iterative approach to ensure efficiency.\n2. **Modular Exponentiation**: We use Python's built-in `pow` function with three arguments to efficiently compute large powers modulo 998244353.\n3. **Modular Inverse**: Using Fermat's Little Theorem, we compute the modular inverse of `2^n` as `pow(2, n, MOD)` raised to the power `MOD-2` modulo `MOD`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required probability even for large values of `n` up to 200,000.",
