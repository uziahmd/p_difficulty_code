He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to check if a given string can be formed in a specific way by three friends appending certain characters. Let's break down the problem.\n\nThe problem says that A starts with some 'a's, then B appends some 'b's, and then C appends 'c's. But C has to append a number of 'c's equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string after B's addition. Also, the order must be strictly a's followed by b's followed by c's. So, any other arrangement would make it invalid.\n\nFirst, I think I should parse the input string and count the occurrences of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's. But I also need to ensure the order is correct. So the string must start with one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, then one or more 'c's. If any part of this is violated, the answer is NO.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Check if the string is non-empty and follows the order a's -> b's -> c's.\n2. Count the number of a's, b's, and c's.\n3. Ensure that there is at least one a and one b (since B appends some b's, making sure the string has at least one each).\n4. Then, check if the count of c's is equal to the count of a's or the count of b's. It can be equal to both as well.\n\nWait, but wait. The string is built as A adds a's, then B adds b's, then C adds c's. So the structure is: all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So the string cannot have any b's before an a, any a's after a b, etc. So the order is crucial.\n\nSo first, I'll process the string to check the order.\n\nHow can I check the order? Well, the string should consist of a series of a's, followed by a series of b's, followed by a series of c's. There shouldn't be any mixing between these groups.\n\nSo I can iterate through the string and see if it's structured correctly. For example, once a 'b' is encountered, no 'a's should come after that. Similarly, once a 'c' is found, no a's or b's should follow.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this. Maybe I can track the current allowed characters. Initially, only 'a's are allowed. Once a 'b' is found, the allowed characters switch to 'b's and 'c's. Once a 'c' is found, only 'c's are allowed.\n\nAlternatively, I can split the string into segments where each segment is a contiguous run of the same character. Then, the runs must be in the order a, b, c. So the runs should be exactly three: the first being a's, second b's, third c's. And each run must consist of only one type of character.\n\nFor example, the string 'aaabccc' would split into runs of 'aaa', 'bb', 'ccc' — which is valid.\n\nThe string 'aabba' would have runs like 'aa', 'bb', 'a' — which is invalid because the last run is a's again.\n\nSimilarly, 'abac' would have runs 'a', 'b', 'a', 'c' — which is invalid because after 'b', a 'a' comes again.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Split the string into runs of same characters.\n- Check that the runs are exactly three, and they are in the order a, b, c.\n- Each run's character must be different from the previous, except for the order.\n\nWait, more specifically:\n\n- The runs list must have exactly three elements.\n- The first run must be all 'a's.\n- The second run must be all 'b's.\n- The third run must be all 'c's.\n\nIf any of these conditions are not met, the string is invalid.\n\nOnce the structure is confirmed, we can proceed to check the counts.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Check if the string is non-empty and has at least one 'a' and one 'b' (since B appends some 'b's, the string after B's step must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'). Wait, no. Because A appends some 'a's, so after A, there are at least one 'a'. Then B appends at least one 'b' — so the string after B has at least one a and one b. Then C appends at least one 'c' — so the string after C has at least one a, one b, and one c.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says that after B appends,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by three friends appending specific characters in a particular order. The string must start with 'a's, followed by 'b's, and end with 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must equal the number of either 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order Structure**: The string must consist of contiguous segments of 'a's, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's. We can split the string into runs of the same character and ensure these runs follow the order 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n2. **Count Characters**: After verifying the order, count the occurrences of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n3. **Validate Counts**: Ensure there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then, check if the number of 'c's equals the number of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Split the string into runs\nruns = []\ncurrent_char = None\nfor c in s:\n    if c != current_char:\n        runs.append(c)\n        current_char = c\n\n# Check if there are exactly three runs: a, b, c\nif len(runs) != 3:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    expected = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n    valid_order = True\n    for i in range(3):\n        if runs[i] != expected[i]:\n            valid_order = False\n            break\n    if not valid_order:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        # Count each character\n        count_a = s.count('a')\n        count_b = s.count('b')\n        count_c = s.count('c')\n        \n        # Check if counts meet the conditions\n        if count_a < 1 or count_b < 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if (count_c == count_a) or (count_c == count_b):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The string is split into contiguous runs of characters. We ensure there are exactly three runs in the order 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n2. **Character Counts**: After confirming the correct order, we count the occurrences of each character.\n3. **Validation**: We check if the number of 'c's matches the number of 'a's or 'b's, ensuring the string meets all the problem's criteria.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks both the structure and the required conditions, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal.",
