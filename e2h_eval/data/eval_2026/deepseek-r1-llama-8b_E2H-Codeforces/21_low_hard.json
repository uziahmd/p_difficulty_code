The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where Neko found some treasure chests and keys, and needs to open as many chests as possible. The way it works is that each key can unlock a chest if the sum of their numbers is odd. Hmm, right.\n\nLet me think about how the keys and chests interact. Each key can be used once, and each chest can be opened once. So for each key, I need to find a chest where a_i + b_j is odd. But since we want to maximize the number of chests opened, I need to figure out how to pair the keys and chests optimally.\n\nWait, the condition a_i + b_j is odd implies that one has to be even and the other odd. So for each key, it's either even or odd. Let's see:\n\nIf a key is even (b_j is even), then to get an odd sum, the chest's a_i must be odd.\nIf a key is odd (b_j is odd), then the chest's a_i must be even.\n\nSo the idea is to count the number of even and odd keys, and similarly for the chests, then match them in a way that maximizes the total.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n   - Let’s say even_keys = number of keys with b_j even.\n   - odd_keys = m - even_keys.\n\n2. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n   - even_chests = number of a_i even.\n   - odd_chests = n - even_chests.\n\nNow, for a key to unlock a chest, the parity must differ. So, for each key, whether it's even or odd, it can only unlock a chest of opposite parity.\n\nSo, to maximize the number of chests opened, we should use as many pairs as possible between the keys and chests of opposite parities.\n\nBut wait, how do we distribute the keys to the chests?\n\nI think the optimal approach is to first try to pair all even keys with the available odd chests, and then pair the remaining even keys with the remaining even chests? No, wait, no. Wait, no—because if a key is even, it can only unlock an odd chest. So perhaps the steps are:\n\n- Use even keys to unlock odd chests.\n- Use odd keys to unlock even chests.\n\nAdditionally, maybe after using some, there are leftover keys that can't be used, but perhaps not enough chests left.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible is the minimum between the sum of even chests and even keys plus the sum of odd chests and odd keys, but that's not exactly correct because each key can only be used once.\n\nWait, no. Let me think differently.\n\nWe can model this as two separate bipartite graphs: one between even keys and odd chests, and another between odd keys and even chests. We need to find the maximum matching in both and sum them up.\n\nBut since each key can be used at most once, and each chest too, it's more like a bipartite graph where each key is connected to all possible chests it can unlock.\n\nThe maximum matching would be the number of chests that can be unlocked.\n\nBut calculating this efficiently might be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about how to assign keys to chests:\n\nEach even key can unlock any odd chest. So the maximum number of such pairs is the minimum of even_keys and odd_chests.\n\nSimilarly, each odd key can unlock any even chest. So the maximum number here is the minimum of odd_keys and even_chests.\n\nThen, the total maximum would be the sum of these two minima.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the even keys can only unlock odd chests, and the odd keys can only unlock even chests. These are two separate pools that don't interfere with each other.\n\nSo, the maximum number of chests is the sum of the two minima: min(even_keys, odd_chests) + min(odd_keys, even_chests).\n\nBut wait, what if the sum of these two minima exceeds n? Because each chest can be opened once.\n\nNo, because each key can only be used once, and each chest can be opened by at most one key.\n\nWait, no. Because for example, if even_keys is 5 and odd_chests is 3. Then min is 3. So even_keys will use 3, leaving 2 even keys unused. Similarly, if odd_keys is 4 and even_chests is 2, min is 2. So total is 5, but if n is larger than 5, that's fine.\n\nBut wait, the total number of chests opened can't exceed n, because you can't open more chests than you have.\n\nSo the maximum is the minimum of (sum of minima) and n.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum of minima could be more than n, but in reality, you can't open more chests than you have.\n\nWait, let me think of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that Neko can open using the available keys. Each key can unlock a chest if the sum of the key's number and the chest's number is odd. This means that each key must be paired with a chest of the opposite parity (even or odd).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count the number of even and odd keys and chests.\n2. **Pair Even Keys with Odd Chests**: The maximum number of pairs here is the minimum of the number of even keys and the number of odd chests.\n3. **Pair Odd Keys with Even Chests**: Similarly, the maximum number of pairs here is the minimum of the number of odd keys and the number of even chests.\n4. **Sum the Pairs**: Add the results from the two pairings to get the total number of chests that can be opened.\n5. **Check Against Total Chests**: Ensure the total does not exceed the total number of chests available.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n, m = int(input[ptr]), int(input[ptr+1])\n    ptr += 2\n    a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))\n    ptr += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+m]))\n    \n    # Count even and odd in a\n    even_a = 0\n    odd_a = 0\n    for num in a:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_a += 1\n        else:\n            odd_a += 1\n    \n    # Count even and odd in b\n    even_b = 0\n    odd_b = 0\n    for num in b:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_b += 1\n        else:\n            odd_b += 1\n    \n    # Pair even_b (keys) with odd_a (chests)\n    pairs1 = min(even_b, odd_a)\n    # Pair odd_b (keys) with even_a (chests)\n    pairs2 = min(odd_b, even_a)\n    \n    total = pairs1 + pairs2\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Counting Parities**: We first determine how many keys and chests are even or odd. This helps us understand which keys can unlock which chests.\n- **Pairing Strategy**: By pairing even keys with odd chests and odd keys with even chests, we maximize the number of chests that can be opened because each key must be used with a chest of opposite parity.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently counts and pairs using simple loops and arithmetic operations, ensuring it handles the upper limits of the problem constraints effectively.\n\nThis approach ensures that we use each key and chest optimally to maximize the number of chests opened, providing an efficient and correct solution to the problem.",
