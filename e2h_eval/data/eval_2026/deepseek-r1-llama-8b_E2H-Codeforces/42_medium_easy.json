    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about copying files and tracking the progress bars. There are two progress bars: one shows the percentage of the current file being copied, and the other shows the overall percentage across all files. Both are updated after each byte is copied. I need to find all integers from 0 to 100 inclusive where both progress bars show the same value at some moment.\n\nHmm. So for each possible x (the number of bytes copied so far), I need to calculate what both progress bars show and see if they're equal. But wait, x can be up to the sum of all a_i, right? Because that's the total bytes being copied.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. For each step x (from 0 to total_bytes), I'll compute the two percentages:\n\n1. The first progress bar is floor(100 * x / a_i) for the i-th file. Wait, no—wait, when you copy x bytes from the i-th file, but in the context of the overall process. Oh wait, no, the first progress bar is for the current file being copied. So for each x, we can track which file is being processed and how much has been copied from it.\n\nWait, but how do I model the steps? Because each file is copied one after another. So for example, the first file is copied entirely, then the second, etc. So for the i-th file, during its copy, the x increases by the size of a_i, step by step.\n\nSo perhaps I can simulate the process step by step:\n\n- Keep track of the total bytes copied so far (total_x). Initially 0.\n- For each file i from 0 to n-1:\n   - Copy each byte of a_i, updating the current file's progress.\n   - After each byte, compute the two progress bars and check if they are equal.\n\nBut since a_i can be up to 1000, and n up to 100, the maximum x is 100*1000=1e5, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but for each byte, that's 1e5 steps, which is acceptable for Python.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nInitialize total_x = 0.\n\nFor each file in order:\n   for b in 1 to a_i:\n      current_file_x = previous + b\n      current_file_percent = floor(100 * current_file_x / a_i)\n      total_percent = floor(100 * total_x / total_a)\n      if current_file_percent == total_percent:\n          add to the result set.\n      update total_x += b\n\nWait, but for each file, the progress is computed as per the current x. So for each byte added, the current_file_percent is based on how much of the file has been copied so far, and the total_percent is based on the total bytes copied so far divided by the sum of all files.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, but the initial state is both at 0. So before any copying, we should include 0 as a possible value.\n\nSo in the simulation, the initial state (x=0) will have both at 0. So we should add 0 to the result.\n\nThen, for each step, after adding each byte, we compute the current progress bars and see if they match.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"after copying each byte\", so for each byte, including the very first one, we check.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Compute the sum of all a_i, call it total_sum.\n\n- Initialize total_x = 0.\n\n- Initialize a set to collect the matching percentages.\n\n- Add 0 to the set because at the beginning, both are 0.\n\n- Then, for each file in order:\n\n   current_file = a_i\n\n   for x_in_file in 1 to a_i:\n\n       current_x = total_x + x_in_file\n\n       current_percent = floor(100 * (current_x - total_x) / current_file)\n\n       total_percent = floor(100 * current_x / total_sum)\n\n       if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n           add to the set.\n\n   after processing the file, total_x += a_i.\n\nWait, no. Because x_in_file is the bytes copied from the current file. So for each byte, the current_x is the total bytes copied so far plus this byte.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model it is:\n\nAt the start of processing file i, the total_x is the sum of the first i-1 files.\n\nFor each step j in 1 to a_i:\n\n   current_file_j = j\n\n   current_file_percent = floor( (100 * j) / a_i )\n\n   total_x_j = total_x + j\n\n   total_percent = floor( (100 * total_x_j) / total_sum )\n\n   if current_file_percent == total_percent, add to the set.\n\nAfter processing all j, add a_i to total_x.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo for each j from 1 to a_i, we compute the two percentages and check.\n\nNow, the main steps are:\n\n1. Read n and the list a.\n\n2. Compute total_sum = sum(a).\n\n3. Initialize total_x = 0.\n\n4. Initialize a set res with 0.\n\n5. For each ai in a:\n\n   for j in 1..ai:\n\n       current_file_p = (100 * j) // ai  # since it's floor division.\n\n       total_x_j = total_x + j\n\n       total_p = (100 * total_x_j) // total_sum\n\n       if current_file_p == total_p:\n\n           res.add(current_file_p)\n\n   total_x += ai\n\n6. After processing all, sort the res and output each number with a newline.\n\nWait, but let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=1, a=[6]\n\ntotal_sum=6.\n\nProcessing the file:\n\nj runs from 1 to 6.\n\nFor each j:\n\ncurrent_file_p = 100*j//6.\n\ntotal_x_j = j (since total_x was 0 before processing this file).\n\ntotal_p = 100*j //6.\n\nSo for each j, current_file_p equals total_p, so all j's (and thus all steps) will contribute.\n\nThus, the set includes 0, and for each j, 100*j//6.\n\nCompute:\n\nj=1: 16.666..., floor is 16.\n\nj=2: 33.333, 33.\n\nj=3:50, 50.\n\nj=4: 66.666, 66.\n\nj=5:83.333, 83.\n\nj=6:100, 100.\n\nSo the set is {0,16,33,50,66,83,100}.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample: second input.\n\nn=2, a=[100,500].\n\nTotal_sum=600.\n\nProcessing first file (100):\n\nj from 1 to 100.\n\ncurrent_file_p is 100*j//100 = j.\n\ntotal_x_j is j.\n\ntotal_p is 100*j//600.\n\nWe need to see when j equals 100j/600.\n\nThat is, j = (100j)/600 → 600j =100j → 600j-100j=500j=0 → j=0. So only j=0 is possible, which is already included.\n\nWait, but for each j, j vs 100j/600.\n\nWhen does j equal 100j/600?\n\nThat would be j = 100j/600 → j (1 - 100/600) =0 → j*500/600=0 → j=0. So only j=0.\n\nSo during the first file's processing, the only time when the two progress bars are equal is when j=0, which is already in the set.\n\nSo during the first file, no new elements except 0.\n\nThen, after processing the first file, total_x becomes 100.\n\nNow, process the second file (500).\n\nFor each j in 1 to 500.\n\ncurrent_file_p = (100j)//500 = 0 for j<500, 100 for j=500.\n\nWait, no. 100j//500 is 0 when j<500, because 100*1=100 <500 → 0. When j=500, 100*500=50000 → 50000//500=100.\n\nTotal_x_j is 100 + j.\n\nTotal_p is 100*(100 + j)/600.\n\nWe need current_file_p (which is 0 or 100) to equal total_p.\n\nSo let's compute for each j:\n\nCase 1: current_file_p is 0.\n\nWhich is when j <500.\n\nSo 0 must equal floor(100*(100 +j)/600).\n\nSo 100*(100 +j)/600 ≤0.999...\n\nBut 100*(100 +j) ≥100*100=10000.\n\nSo 100*(100 +j)/600 is ≥ 10000/600 ≈16.666...\n\nSo 0 can't equal that. So in this case, no matches.\n\nCase 2: j=500.\n\ncurrent_file_p = 100.\n\ntotal_x_j = 100+500=600.\n\ntotal_p= 100*600/600=100.\n\nSo both are 100.\n\nThus, when j=500, the progress bars are both 100.\n\nSo during the second file's processing, the only j that contributes is 500.\n\nThus, the set includes 0, and 100.\n\nWait, but the sample output for the second test case is:\n\n0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100\n\nWait, that suggests that there are more values. Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the progress bars are updated after each byte is copied, not after each step in the file.\n\nWait, but for the second test case, according to the note, the first progress bar immediately goes up, then resets, and then catches up.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the logic.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\n\nAfter copying each byte, both progress bars are updated.\n\nSo for each byte, not just per file.\n\nSo for the second test case, when the first file is being processed, after each byte, the first progress bar updates, but the second remains zero until the entire first file is processed.\n\nWait, no. Because the second progress bar is based on the total bytes copied. So while processing the first file, the second progress bar is zero until the first file is fully processed.\n\nAh, I see! That's a crucial point.\n\nSo, during the processing of the first file, the second progress bar remains zero. Only when the first file is completely processed, the second progress bar starts reflecting the bytes from the second file.\n\nSo in the second test case, when j is 100 (the first file is done), the total_x becomes 100. Now, for the second file, each j adds to the total_x.\n\nSo, let's re-simulate the second test case:\n\nn=2, a = [100,500]. Total_sum =600.\n\nInitialize total_x=0.\n\nres = {0}\n\nProcess first file (100):\n\nfor j in 1..100:\n\n   current_file_p = 100*j//100 =j.\n\n   total_x_j =0 +j =j.\n\n   total_p =100*j//600.\n\n   compare j and 100j/600.\n\n   So when j=0 → already in set.\n\n   Else, for j=1: current_p=1, total_p=0 (since 100*1//600=0). Not equal.\n\n   Similarly, for all j from 1 to 100:\n\n   current_p is j, total_p is 0 until j reaches 100.\n\n   When j=100:\n\n   current_p=100, total_p=100*100//600 = 16.666 → 16.\n\n   So 100 !=16 → no match.\n\nSo after processing first file, res is still {0}.\n\nNow, process second file (500):\n\ntotal_x is 100.\n\nfor j in 1..500:\n\n   current_file_p = 100j//500 = 0 when j<500, 100 when j=500.\n\n   total_x_j =100 +j.\n\n   total_p = 100*(100 +j)/600.\n\n   We need current_file_p == total_p.\n\n   So for j from 1 to 499:\n\n      current_file_p is 0.\n\n      total_p is (100*(100 +j))//600.\n\n      So 0 == (100*(100 +j))//600 ?\n\n      Well, 100*(100 +j) is between 100*101=10100 and 100*500=50000.\n\n      10100/600 ≈16.833, so floor is 16.\n\n      So 0 ==16 → no.\n\n   For j=500:\n\n      current_file_p=100.\n\n      total_x_j=600 → 100*600/600=100 → yes.\n\n      So add 100.\n\nSo the res now is {0,100}.\n\nBut according to the sample output, the second test case's output is '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100'.\n\nWait, this suggests that during the processing of the second file, there are other points where the progress bars match.\n\nSo what's wrong with my reasoning?\n\nAh, I think I misunderstood the order of the progress bars.\n\nWait, when processing the second file, the first progress bar is for that file, and the second is the total progress.\n\nWait, but perhaps during the processing of the second file, the first progress bar is reset once the first file is done.\n\nNo, the first progress bar is per file, so after the first file is done, it's reset to 0% again, but only after the entire file is processed.\n\nWait, no. The first progress bar is per current file being copied. So when you start processing the second file, the first progress bar is zero because it's a new file. Or is it?\n\nWait, no. The first progress bar is for the current file being processed, regardless of whether it's the same as the previous.\n\nSo for the second file, during its processing, the first progress bar is for that file.\n\nSo, for each j in the second file, the first progress bar is 100j/500, which is 0 when j <500, 100 when j=500.\n\nThe second progress bar is 100*(100 + j)/600.\n\nSo let's compute for j=95:\n\ncurrent_file_p=0.\n\ntotal_p=(100 +95)*100 /600 →195*100=19500 →19500/600=32.5 →32.\n\nSo 0 !=32.\n\nWait, but why is 95 in the sample output?\n\nHmm, perhaps during the processing of the second file, after the first file is done, the total_x is 100. So for j in the second file, when j is such that 100 +j is 95% of 600.\n\nWait, let's compute when 100 + j is 95% of 600.\n\n95% of 600 is 570.\n\nSo 100 +j =570 →j=470.\n\nSo when j=470, the total_p is 95%.\n\nWhat about the current_file_p? It's 0 because j is 470 <500.\n\nSo 0 !=95 → no.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the processing of the first file, when the total_x is 100, but the second progress bar is (100*100)/600=16.666… →16%.\n\nBut the first progress bar is 100 for the first file's last byte.\n\nSo, when the first file is completed, the first progress bar is 100%, and the second is 16%. So they are not equal.\n\nThen, during the second file's processing:\n\nEach j increases total_x_j by 1.\n\nSo for j=1, total_x_j=101. total_p is 101*100//600= (10100)//600=16.833→16.\n\ncurrent_file_p is 0. So 0 !=16.\n\nSimilarly, j=2: current_file_p=0, total_p=10200//600=17 →17.\n\nSo 0 !=17.\n\nThis continues until j=500.\n\nWait, but the sample output for the second test case is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nHmm, I must have a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the progress bars are calculated differently.\n\nWait, the problem statement says:\n\nAfter copying each byte, both progress bars are updated.\n\nThe first progress bar is for the current file, which is the file being processed. So, for the second file, the first progress bar is 100*j/500, as I thought.\n\nThe second progress bar is for the total, which is (sum of all a_i) × (total_x / sum a_i) ×100, floored.\n\nSo for the second test case:\n\nAfter the first file is processed (100 bytes), the second file is processed.\n\nAt this point, the first progress bar is 0% (as it's for the second file, which hasn't been processed yet).\n\nThe second progress bar is 100 * (100) /600 =16.666... →16%.\n\nSo when j is 1 in the second file:\n\ntotal_x becomes 101.\n\ncurrent_file_p is 100*1//500=0.\n\ntotal_p is 101*100/600=16.833… →16.\n\nSo 0 vs 16 → no.\n\nj=2: 200 bytes in second file? No, j=2 is 2 bytes.\n\nWait, no, j is the number of bytes in the current file being processed. So for each j, the current_file_p is 100*j//500.\n\nThe total_x is 100 + j.\n\nSo for j=500, total_x is 600, so total_p is 100%.\n\nBut how do other j's contribute?\n\nWait, perhaps during the second file's processing, the first progress bar can reach a certain value, and the total progress bar also reaches that value, even though the first progress bar is for the current file.\n\nSo perhaps for some j, the current_file_p and the total_p are equal.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nWe need 100*j /500 = 100*(100 +j)/600.\n\nSimplify:\n\nMultiply both sides by 500*600 to eliminate denominators.\n\n100j *600 = 500*100*(100 +j)\n\n60000j = 50000 (100 +j)\n\n60000j = 50000*100 +50000j\n\n60000j -50000j = 5,000,000\n\n10000j =5,000,000 → j=500.\n\nWhich is the case when j=500, so the progress bars are both 100%.\n\nBut in the sample output, it's showing 95, 96, etc. So perhaps I'm missing cases where the current_file is the first file, but the total is being calculated correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, maybe during the processing of the second file, the first progress bar is for the second file, but the second progress bar is based on all files, including the first.\n\nSo, during the second file's processing, the second progress bar is 100*(100 +j)/600.\n\nSo, let's see when 100j/500 = 100*(100 +j)/600.\n\nAs above, this gives j=500.\n\nBut the sample output shows other values. So perhaps there are other cases where the progress bars are equal due to the cumulative effect.\n\nWait, perhaps when the first file is being processed, the second progress bar is zero, but the first is at 100.\n\nNo, because the second progress bar is zero until the first file is done.\n\nWait, but when the first file is done, the second progress bar is 100% (since 100 /600 is 16.666... →16%)? No, 100/600 is 16.666%, so floor is 16.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the problem statement says:\n\nIn the example, the second test case's output is 0,95,96,...,100.\n\nSo perhaps in that case, during the processing of the second file, the second progress bar can reach 95% when the first progress bar is 95% of the second file.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nBecause for the second file, the first progress bar is 100*j /500.\n\nSo 100j /500 = p.\n\nThe second progress bar is 100*(100 +j)/600.\n\nWe need p = 100*(100 +j)/600.\n\nSo 100j/500 = (100*(100+j))/600.\n\nMultiply both sides by 600*500 to eliminate denominators:\n\n600*100j = 500*100*(100+j)\n\n60,000j = 50,000 (100 +j)\n\n60,000j =5,000,000 +50,000j\n\n60,000j -50,000j =5,000,000 →10,000j=5,000,000 →j=500.\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo why does the sample output have 95, etc.?\n\nI must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the progress bars can be equal when the first file is being processed, but the second progress bar is zero.\n\nWait, during the first file's processing, the second progress bar is zero until the first file is done.\n\nSo, for j in 1..100, current_file_p is j, and total_p is zero.\n\nSo j can be zero, which is already in the set.\n\nNo other matches.\n\nThen, during the second file's processing, j ranges from 1..500.\n\ncurrent_file_p is 0 or 100.\n\nAnd total_p is 100*(100 +j)/600.\n\nSo, when j is 500, total_p is 100.\n\nSo, the only matches are 0 and 100.\n\nBut the sample output shows more values.\n\nHmm, this suggests that my simulation approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the progress bars are updated simultaneously for all files.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the progress bars show the current file's progress and the total progress.\n\nSo, perhaps during the processing of the second file, the first progress bar is for the current file, but the second progress bar is for the total.\n\nSo, perhaps during the second file's processing, the second progress bar can be 95% when the total bytes is such that 100*(100 +j)/600 =95.\n\nSo, 100*(100 +j) =95 *600 → 100*100 +100j =57,000 → 10,000 +100j =57,000 →100j=47,000 →j=470.\n\nAt j=470, current_file_p is 100*470 /500 =94.\n\nSo, 94 !=95.\n\nSo, no match.\n\nWait, but 100*(100+470)/600 = 57000 /600 =95 → yes.\n\nBut the current_file_p is 470*100 /500 =94.\n\nSo, 94 !=95.\n\nNo match.\n\nHmm, so where do these other numbers come from?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating something.\n\nWait, looking back at the note for the second test case:\n\n\"In the second test case, the first progress bar immediately goes up, then resets to zero and starts chasing the second progress bar again.\"\n\nSo during the first file's processing, the first progress bar goes up to 100, then when the second file starts, the first progress bar resets to zero, and then the second progress bar is increasing.\n\nSo during the second file's processing, the first progress bar is the j-th byte of the second file, so it's 100*j/500.\n\nThe second progress bar is 100*(100 +j)/600.\n\nSo for j=95 in the second file:\n\ncurrent_file_p is 19% (100*95/500 =19).\n\nWait, 100*95=9500 →9500/500=19 → yes.\n\nTotal_p is 100*(100+95)/600 =19500/600=32.5 →32.\n\nSo 19 !=32.\n\nWait, but 95 is in the sample output.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps when the second file is being processed, the first progress bar is for the second file, but the second progress bar is for the total, which includes both files.\n\nWait, perhaps during the second file's processing, after some j's, the first progress bar is 95% of the second file, but the total progress bar is also 95% of the total.\n\nSo, 100j /500 =95 →j=475.\n\nSo when j=475, current_file_p is 95.\n\nTotal_x_j is 100 +475=575.\n\nTotal_p is 100*575 /600 = 57500/600=95.833… →95.\n\nSo yes, 95=95.\n\nThus, j=475 is a match.\n\nSo, this explains why 95 is in the sample output.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation when solving for p= (100j/500) = (100*(100+j)/600), I found j=500 as the solution.\n\nBut this is a different scenario: j is 475, which is less than 500.\n\nSo in this case, current_file_p is 95, and total_p is 95.\n\nSo, in this case, the two progress bars are equal.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial approach is incomplete because I only considered the case where the current_file is being processed, and the total is based on all files.\n\nSo the condition is:\n\ncurrent_file_p = total_p.\n\nWhere current_file_p is 100 * j_current / a_i.\n\nAnd total_p is 100 * total_x_j / total_sum.\n\nSo, for the second test case, when j=475 in the second file:\n\ncurrent_file_p = 100 *475 /500 =95.\n\ntotal_x_j=100+475=575.\n\ntotal_p=100 *575 /600 =95.833... →95.\n\nSo 95=95.\n\nThus, this j contributes to the set.\n\nSo, the approach needs to consider all j's in all files, not just j's in the current file.\n\nSo, the initial approach is correct, but I had missed considering this case.\n\nSo, the simulation approach is correct.\n\nThus, the algorithm should proceed as follows:\n\nFor each possible j (from 1 to a_i), compute current_file_p and total_p, and check for equality.\n\nThus, the code will correctly find all such percentages.\n\nSo, in the second test case:\n\nWhen j=475 in the second file, current_file_p is 95, and total_p is 95.\n\nThus, 95 is added to the set.\n\nSimilarly, for j=470:\n\ncurrent_file_p=47.\n\ntotal_p= (470+100)/600 *100 → (570/600)*100=95 →95.\n\n47 !=95 → no.\n\nWait, wait, j=475 is 475 bytes into the second file.\n\nSo for j=475:\n\ncurrent_file_p = 475 *100 /500 =95.\n\ntotal_x_j=100 +475=575.\n\ntotal_p= (575 *100)/600=95.833... →95.\n\nSo 95=95 → yes.\n\nThus, 95 is added.\n\nSimilarly, for j=476:\n\ncurrent_file_p=476*100/500=95.2 →95.\n\ntotal_p=57600/600=96 →96.\n\n95 !=96 → no.\n\nWait, but 57600/600 is 96 exactly.\n\nSo, 95 !=96.\n\nSo, j=475 is a match.\n\nSimilarly, for j=480:\n\ncurrent_file_p=48*100/500=96.\n\ntotal_x_j=580.\n\n580*100/600=96.666… →96.\n\nSo 96=96 → yes.\n\nThus, j=480 is a match.\n\nWait, let's compute for j=480:\n\ncurrent_file_p=480 *100 /500=96.\n\ntotal_x_j=580 →580*100/600= (580*100)/600 =58000/600=96.666… →96.\n\nSo 96=96 → yes.\n\nThus, j=480 is a match.\n\nSimilarly, j=490:\n\ncurrent_file_p=49 →490*100/500=98.\n\ntotal_p=590*100/600=98.333… →98.\n\nSo 98=98 → yes.\n\nj=495:\n\ncurrent_file_p=99.\n\ntotal_p=595*100/600=99.166… →99.\n\nSo 99=99 → yes.\n\nj=500:\n\ncurrent_file_p=100.\n\ntotal_p=600*100/600=100 → yes.\n\nThus, the set for the second test case includes 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nThus, the initial simulation approach is correct.\n\nSo, the code needs to process each j for each file, compute the two progress bars, and collect the matches.\n\nNow, to implement this in Python.\n\nRead n, then the list of a.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nInitialize total_x=0.\n\nres = set()\n\nres.add(0)\n\nfor ai in a:\n\n    for j in range(1, ai+1):\n\n        current_file_p = (100 * j) // ai\n\n        total_x_j = total_x + j\n\n        total_p = (100 * total_x_j) // total_sum\n\n        if current_file_p == total_p:\n\n            res.add(current_file_p)\n\n    total_x += ai\n\nFinally, collect the sorted list of res, print each on a separate line.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the third sample input:\n\nInput:\n\n4\n\n170 130 400 256 30 100\n\nWait, the third input line is '4\\n170 130 400 256 30 100'? Or is it split into 4 files with those sizes?\n\nWait, the input lines are given as strings. For example, the first input is '1\\n6', which represents n=1 and a=[6].\n\nSo in the third sample input, it's '4\\n170 130 400 256 30 100' → n=4, a=[170, 130, 400, 256, 30, 100] → wait, no, because n=4, but the second line has 6 numbers. That seems like a typo, perhaps.\n\nWait, perhaps the third sample input is:\n\n['4\\n170 130 400 256', '6\\n30 100']\n\nWait, no, the sample input is provided as:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\nSo for the third input line, n=4, and a is [1000, 2, 2, 998], because the string is '1000 2 2 998'.\n\nWait, no: the third line is '4\\n1000 2 2 998' → n=4, a is [1000, 2, 2, 998].\n\nFourth input line is '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100' →n=6, a is [170,130,400,256,30,100].\n\nSo for the third test case:\n\nn=4, a = [1000,2,2,998].\n\ntotal_sum=1000+2+2+998= 2002.\n\nSimulating:\n\nInitialize total_x=0.\n\nres={0}.\n\nProcessing first file (1000):\n\nfor j in 1..1000:\n\ncurrent_file_p=100*j//1000.\n\ntotal_x_j= j.\n\ntotal_p= 100*j //2002.\n\nCheck if current_file_p == total_p.\n\nWe can find which j's satisfy this.\n\nBut perhaps during this step, the only j is 0, which is already in the set.\n\nThen, after processing this file, total_x becomes 1000.\n\nProcessing second file (2):\n\nj from 1 to 2.\n\nFor j=1:\n\ncurrent_file_p=50 (100*1//2=50).\n\ntotal_x_j=1000+1=1001.\n\ntotal_p=100*1001//2002 = 100.5 →100.\n\nSo 50 !=100.\n\nj=2:\n\ncurrent_file_p=100.\n\ntotal_x_j=1002 →1002*100/2002= 1002/20.02 → approx 50.\n\nWait, 1002 *100=100200 →100200 /2002= 50.099... →50.\n\nSo 100 !=50.\n\nThus, no matches.\n\nProcessing third file (2):\n\nj=1:\n\ncurrent_file_p=50.\n\ntotal_x_j=1000 +2 +1=1003 →1003*100/2002= 100300 /2002=50.1 →50.\n\nSo 50 ==50 → add 50.\n\nj=2:\n\ncurrent_file_p=100.\n\ntotal_x_j=1000+4=1004 →1004*100/2002=100400/2002=50.199 →50.\n\n100 !=50 → no.\n\nThus, j=1 in third file adds 50.\n\nProcessing fourth file (998):\n\nj runs from 1 to 998.\n\nFor each j:\n\ncurrent_file_p= 100j//998.\n\ntotal_x_j= 1000 +2 +2 +j= 1004 +j.\n\ntotal_p= 100*(1004 +j)/2002.\n\nWe need 100j/998 = 100*(1004 +j)/2002.\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide both sides by 100:\n\nj/998 = (1004 +j)/20.02.\n\nMultiply both sides by 20.02*998:\n\nj *20.02 = (1004 +j) *998.\n\nBut 20.02 is 2002/100 →20.02 =2002/100.\n\nSo equation:\n\nj * (2002/100) = (1004 +j) *998.\n\nMultiply both sides by 100:\n\nj*2002 = (1004 +j)*99800.\n\nExpand RHS: 1004*99800 + j*99800.\n\nSo:\n\n2002j = 1004*99800 +99800j.\n\n2002j -99800j = 1004*99800.\n\n(2002 -99800)j = ... \n\n2002-99800= -97800.\n\n-97800j = 1004 *99800.\n\nj= -(1004 *99800)/97800.\n\nBut j is positive, so no solution.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the processing of the fourth file, some j's will make current_file_p equal to total_p.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to see that when j is 997:\n\ncurrent_file_p= 99700 /998 →99.898 →99.\n\ntotal_x_j=1004 +997=2001.\n\ntotal_p= 2001*100 /2002 →200100 /2002=99.949 →99.\n\nThus, current_file_p=99, total_p=99 → yes.\n\nSo j=997 adds 99.\n\nSimilarly, j=998:\n\ncurrent_file_p=100.\n\ntotal_x_j=1004 +998=2002.\n\ntotal_p=2002*100/2002=100 →100.\n\nThus, 100=100 → yes.\n\nThus, j=997 and j=998 add 99 and 100.\n\nSo during the fourth file's processing, 99 and 100 are added.\n\nThus, the third test case's output includes 0,50,99,100.\n\nWait, but the sample output is '0\\n50\\n99\\n100'.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code correctly captures all these cases.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead n, then the list.\n\nCompute total_sum.\n\nSimulate each file, each j, compute current_file_p and total_p.\n\nCollect in a set.\n\nSort and output.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\nTest case with n=1:\n\nAll j's add to the set, as current_file_p and total_p are same.\n\nAnother edge case: all a_i are 1.\n\nThus, each j is 1, and the total_x increases by 1 each step.\n\nThus, for each j, current_file_p is 100*j/1= j%100.\n\nTotal_p is 100*(j)/n.\n\nNeed to find when j mod 100 = 100j/n.\n\nBut this may vary based on n.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, a=[1,1,1].\n\ntotal_sum=3.\n\nProcessing first file:\n\nj=1: current_file_p=100, total_p=100*1/3=33 → no.\n\nThus, no addition.\n\nProcessing second file:\n\nj=1: current_file_p=100, total_x=2 → total_p=200/3=66.666 →66.\n\n100 !=66.\n\nj=2: current_file_p=200/1=200 →200, total_x=3 →3/3=100 →100.\n\nSo 200 !=100.\n\nThus, no addition.\n\nProcessing third file:\n\nj=1: current_file_p=100, total_x=4 →4/3=133.333 →133.\n\n100 !=133.\n\nj=2: current_file_p=200, total_x=5 →5/3=166.666 →166.\n\nNo.\n\nj=3: current_file_p=300 →300, total_x=6 →6/3=200 →200.\n\n300 !=200.\n\nThus, the only element is 0.\n\nSo output is '0'.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, a=[500,500]. total_sum=1000.\n\nProcessing first file:\n\nj=500: current_file_p=100, total_p=500/1000=50. So 100 !=50.\n\nNo match.\n\nProcessing second file:\n\nj=500: current_file_p=100, total_x=1000 →1000/1000=100.\n\nSo 100=100 → add.\n\nThus, res is {0,100}.\n\nThus, output is '0\\n100'.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the moments during the file copying process where both progress bars (one showing the percentage of the current file and the other showing the overall percentage) display the same value. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Understanding**: We are given `n` files to copy, each with a specific size. The progress bars update after each byte is copied. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file being copied, while the second shows the overall percentage across all files.\n\n2. **Simulation**: We simulate the copying process step by step. For each file, we track the number of bytes copied so far (`total_x`). After each byte is copied, we compute the current progress for both bars:\n   - The current file's progress: `floor(100 * j / a_i)` where `j` is the number of bytes copied from the current file.\n   - The overall progress: `floor(100 * total_x / total_sum)` where `total_sum` is the sum of all file sizes.\n\n3. **Check for Matches**: For each byte copied, we check if the two progress values are equal. If they are, we record that value.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the initial state (0% for both bars) is a valid match and ensure all possible values from 0 to 100 are considered.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\ntotal_x = 0\nres = {0}\n\nfor ai in a:\n    for j in range(1, ai + 1):\n        current_file_p = (100 * j) // ai\n        total_x_j = total_x + j\n        total_p = (100 * total_x_j) // total_sum\n        if current_file_p == total_p:\n            res.add(current_file_p)\n    total_x += ai\n\nfor p in sorted(res):\n    print(p)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of files `n` and their respective sizes.\n- **Initialization**: We initialize `total_sum` as the sum of all file sizes, `total_x` to track the total bytes copied, and a set `res` to store the matching percentages starting with 0.\n- **Processing Each File**: For each file, iterate through each byte, updating the current progress and overall progress, and check for matches.\n- **Updating Results**: Add each matching percentage to the result set.\n- **Output**: Print the results in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks the progress of both bars and ensures all possible matches are found, providing the correct output for the problem.",
