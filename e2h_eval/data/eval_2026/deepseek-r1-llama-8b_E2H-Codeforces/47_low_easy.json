During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.Neko has two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $$$k$$$ such that the least common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $$$k$$$, he needs to choose the smallest one.Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b \\le 10^9$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint the smallest non-negative integer $$$k$$$ ($$$k \\ge 0$$$) such that the lowest common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible.If there are many possible integers $$$k$$$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 10', '21 31', '5 10']\n\n### Output\n['2', '9', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test, one should choose $$$k = 2$$$, as the least common multiple of $$$6 + 2$$$ and $$$10 + 2$$$ is $$$24$$$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Neko wants to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a + k) and (b + k) is minimized. And if there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest one.\n\nHmm, let's think about this. So the problem is about finding the best k to minimize the LCM of a+k and b+k. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, let me rephrase. Letâ€™s denote x = a + k and y = b + k. Then, since k is non-negative, x and y are both greater than or equal to a and b respectively. But wait, no, because a and b can be in any order. Oh right, because a could be bigger or smaller than b. So maybe it's better to consider d as the difference between a and b.\n\nWait, let's compute d = |a - b|. Because when you add the same k to both a and b, the difference remains the same. So x and y will have a difference of d. So the problem reduces to finding two numbers x and y such that y = x + d, and we want their LCM to be as small as possible.\n\nWait, but what's the relationship between x and y? Since y = x + d, then the LCM(x, x+d) needs to be minimized. Interesting.\n\nSo perhaps the key is to find x and x + d whose LCM is as small as possible. But how do we find that?\n\nLet me think about the properties of LCM. The LCM of two numbers is equal to (x * y) / GCD(x, y). So for x and y, which are x and x + d, their GCD is the same as GCD(x, d). Because GCD(x, x + d) = GCD(x, d).\n\nSo LCM(x, x + d) = x*(x + d)/g, where g is GCD(x, d).\n\nBut since y = x + d, the LCM is also equal to (x + d)*x / g. Hmm.\n\nSo to minimize this, perhaps we can find the value of x that makes this expression as small as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal LCM occurs when x and d have a large common divisor, so that g is as large as possible. Because then, the product x*(x + d) would be divided by a larger g, leading to a smaller LCM.\n\nWait, but how does that work? Let's see: if g is large, then the denominator is big, so the fraction becomes smaller, which reduces the LCM. So yes, maximizing g would help minimize the LCM.\n\nSo the plan is to find x such that GCD(x, d) is as large as possible. Because then, the LCM of x and x+d would be x*(x+d)/g, which is minimized when g is maximized.\n\nWait, but wait: the LCM is (x*(x+d)) / g. To minimize this, perhaps the optimal approach is to make g as large as possible, but also consider the size of x.\n\nHmm, but how do we find the optimal x? Let's think about possible x values.\n\nWait, x has to be at least max(a, b), right? Because x = a + k, and k >= 0. Or wait, no: if a is 5 and b is 10, then when k=0, x is 5, y is 10. So x could be less than y, regardless of whether a was bigger or not.\n\nWait, but regardless of that, the difference is fixed as d = |a - b|.\n\nSo to find x, perhaps the minimal LCM occurs when x is chosen such that x and d have a high GCD.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal x is the smallest x that is a multiple of some divisor of d. Because then, GCD(x, d) would be as large as possible.\n\nWait, but how to find such x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal k is determined by the divisors of d.\n\nWait, let me think: d is fixed. We can compute all possible divisors of d, and for each divisor g, find the minimal x such that x is a multiple of g, and x >= min(a, b), and then compute the LCM for each possible g and select the best one.\n\nWait, but perhaps the minimal LCM is achieved when x is the least common multiple of something related to d.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal x is the least common multiple of (d/g) and some other factors, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's take an example.\n\nIn the first sample input, a=6, b=10. So d=4.\n\nWe need to find x such that x and x+4 have a large GCD.\n\nWhat's",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \\( k \\) that yield the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key insight is that adding the same \\( k \\) to both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) does not change their difference. Thus, we can consider the problem in terms of two numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) where \\( y = x + d \\) and \\( d = |a - b| \\). We need to minimize the LCM of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n2. **Optimization Insight**: The LCM of two numbers can be minimized by maximizing their greatest common divisor (GCD). Therefore, we look for \\( x \\) such that \\( x \\) and \\( d \\) have a large GCD.\n\n3. **Divisors of \\( d \\)**: The optimal \\( x \\) can be found by considering the divisors of \\( d \\). For each divisor \\( g \\), we compute the smallest \\( x \\) that is a multiple of \\( g \\) and then calculate the corresponding LCM. The smallest LCM across all these candidates gives the solution.\n\n4. **Efficiency Consideration**: To efficiently find the optimal \\( k \\), we iterate through the divisors of \\( d \\) and compute the corresponding \\( k \\) for each divisor. This ensures that we explore all potential minimal LCMs efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_min_k(a, b):\n    d = abs(a - b)\n    if d == 0:\n        return 0\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0\n    max_candidate = max(a, b) + d\n    # Check all possible divisors of d up to sqrt(d)\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(d)) + 1):\n        if d % i == 0:\n            g = i\n            # Case when divisor is i\n            candidate_x = max(a, b)\n            # Find the smallest multiple of g >= candidate_x\n            if candidate_x % g != 0:\n                candidate_x += g\n            lcm = (candidate_x * (candidate_x + d)) // g\n            k = candidate_x - a\n            if lcm < min_lcm or (lcm == min_lcm and k < best_k):\n                min_lcm = lcm\n                best_k = k\n            # Case when divisor is d/i\n            g = d // i\n            candidate_x = max(a, b)\n            if candidate_x % g != 0:\n                candidate_x += g\n            lcm = (candidate_x * (candidate_x + d)) // g\n            k = candidate_x - a\n            if lcm < min_lcm or (lcm == min_lcm and k < best_k):\n                min_lcm = lcm\n                best_k = k\n    return best_k\n\n# Read input\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(find_min_k(a, b))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n2. **Compute Difference**: Calculate the absolute difference \\( d = |a - b| \\).\n3. **Check for Zero Difference**: If \\( a \\) equals \\( b \\), the answer is 0 because the LCM is simply \\( a \\).\n4. **Iterate Over Divisors**: For each divisor \\( i \\) of \\( d \\), compute the corresponding candidate \\( x \\) and determine the \\( k \\) value.\n5. **Calculate LCM**: For each candidate \\( x \\), compute the LCM and track the minimum LCM and the corresponding \\( k \\).\n6. **Return Result**: Print the smallest \\( k \\) that achieves the minimal LCM.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal \\( k \\) by leveraging the properties of divisors and GCD, ensuring the solution is both correct and efficient.",
