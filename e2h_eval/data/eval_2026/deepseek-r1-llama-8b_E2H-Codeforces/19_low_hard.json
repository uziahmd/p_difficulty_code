The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about selecting which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for each remaining district is maximized. The president wants to remove k districts, and we need to choose which ones to remove.\n\nHmm. So the structure is a tree because there are n-1 edges and exactly one path between any two nodes. Our goal is to select a subset of nodes such that they form a connected subtree (since removing some nodes will split the tree into disconnected parts), and the sum of their 2^i is as large as possible. But wait, no—because when we remove a node, all its connected edges are gone. So the remaining nodes must form a connected component. So the maximum sum would come from choosing a subtree where the sum of 2^i is maximum, but we have to remove k nodes to get this.\n\nWait, but the problem allows us to remove exactly k nodes, right? Because the input says 1 ≤ k < n. So our task is to find a connected subtree with n - k nodes, which has the maximum possible sum of 2^i for all its nodes.\n\nBut how do we model this? Because the optimal way is to include as many high-value nodes as possible. Since 2^i grows exponentially, the higher the i, the better.\n\nSo the strategy should be: keep the largest possible nodes and form a connected component around them, ensuring that the number of nodes in this component is n - k.\n\nWait, but maybe not just the top m nodes, because they might not form a connected subtree. So perhaps the approach is to find a subtree with s = n -k nodes, which includes the highest possible nodes, and is connected.\n\nThis sounds similar to finding the maximum sum of a connected subtree with exactly s nodes. But how?\n\nAnother thought: since 2^i is the value for node i, we can represent each node's value as a priority. We want to include the highest possible values first, but they have to form a connected subtree.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to determine the minimal number of nodes to remove so that the remaining form a connected subtree. Then, if that minimal number is less than or equal to k, we can proceed. But in our case, we have exactly k nodes to remove, so we need to find a connected subtree of size s = n -k.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the sum is maximized when the included nodes are the largest possible, but also connected. So the question is, what's the best way to find a connected subtree with s nodes that includes the largest possible 2^i values.\n\nAn alternative way to think about it: the maximum sum will be the sum of the s largest nodes, provided those s nodes form a connected subtree. If they don't, then we have to find a subset of those s nodes that is connected, and includes as many as possible of the largest nodes.\n\nBut how do we model that?\n\nHmm, another angle: the sum of 2^i is maximized by including as many high i's as possible. So for the optimal solution, the included nodes should be a connected subtree containing the largest possible i's.\n\nSo the process could be:\n\n1. Sort all nodes in decreasing order of i.\n2. Try to include the first s nodes, but only if they form a connected subtree. If not, we have to find a way to include as many as possible, possibly excluding some lower nodes to make the higher nodes connected.\n\nBut how to efficiently check if a set of nodes forms a connected subtree?\n\nWait, but given that the tree is arbitrary, perhaps a better approach is to find the minimal subtree that connects the top s nodes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as finding a subtree of size s that includes the s largest nodes. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the tree's structure. For any subtree, the sum is the sum of 2^i for the nodes in it. So, to maximize this sum, we should include as many as possible of the larger i's.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to find the subtree that contains the s largest nodes and is connected. But how to find such a subtree.\n\nWait, but the subtree must be connected. So, perhaps we can model this as follows: the subtree must contain the s largest nodes, but if they are not already connected, we may have to include some additional nodes to connect them, thus increasing s beyond the desired s.\n\nWait, no. Because the s is fixed as n -k. So, for example, if the top s nodes are not connected, we cannot include all of them because their subtree would require more than s nodes.\n\nSo perhaps the way is to find a subtree that includes as many of the top s nodes as possible,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected component with the maximum possible total number of fans. The key insight is that the sum of 2^i for each district i is maximized when we include the largest possible districts, provided they form a connected subtree.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem can be modeled as finding a connected subtree in a tree (given by the input edges) such that the sum of 2^i for the nodes in this subtree is maximized. We need to remove exactly k nodes to achieve this.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The value 2^i grows exponentially with i, so higher values of i contribute significantly more to the total sum. Therefore, we should prioritize including the highest possible nodes while ensuring they form a connected subtree.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We can use a greedy approach combined with a priority queue to select the nodes with the highest values first. We then check if these nodes form a connected subtree. If they do, we include them; otherwise, we adjust our selection to ensure connectivity.\n\n4. **Complexity Consideration**: Given the constraints, an efficient approach is necessary. Using a priority queue and a union-find data structure helps manage the connections and efficiently determine the optimal nodes to include.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for _ in range(n-1):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n    \n    # Each node's children are its adjacent nodes except the parent\n    # We'll perform a BFS-like traversal, keeping track of parents\n    # To find the subtree with s = n - k nodes, starting from the largest nodes\n    s = n - k\n    \n    # Sort all nodes by their value (2^i) descending\n    nodes = list(range(1, n+1))\n    nodes.sort(key=lambda x: - (1 << (x-1)))\n    \n    # Now, try to find a connected subtree containing as many top nodes as possible\n    # Using a visited array, and a parent pointer to track connections\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    parent = [0] * (n + 1)\n    q = []\n    # We'll process the nodes in order of their value\n    # For each node, if it's not visited, start a BFS to see how many nodes can be included\n    count = 0\n    result = []\n    for node in nodes:\n        if not visited[node]:\n            # Start BFS from this node\n            stack = [(node, -1)]  # (current node, parent)\n            current_count = 1\n            while stack:\n                u, p = stack.pop()\n                if visited[u]:\n                    continue\n                visited[u] = True\n                parent[u] = p\n                for v in edges[u]:\n                    if not visited[v] and v != p:\n                        stack.append((v, u))\n                        current_count += 1\n                        if current_count == s:\n                            break\n                if current_count == s:\n                    break\n            if current_count >= s:\n                # Collect the nodes in this connected component\n                selected = []\n                u = node\n                while u != 0:\n                    selected.append(u)\n                    u = parent[u]\n                # Now, we have a connected component with at least s nodes\n                # We need to collect the s largest nodes within this component\n                # But since we processed nodes in order, the first s in this component are the largest\n                # Wait, no.

We then sort the nodes by their fan values in descending order. Using a BFS approach, we explore each node's connected component starting from the highest fan value. Once we find a component with exactly `s` nodes (where `s = n - k`), we select the top `s` nodes from this component and print them in increasing order. This ensures that we maximize the total number of fans while maintaining connectivity.",
