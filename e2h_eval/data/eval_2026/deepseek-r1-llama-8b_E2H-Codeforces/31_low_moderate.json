Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Vanya is trying to balance the sum of his found cards to zero. The problem gives me the number of found cards (n) and the maximum absolute value x on any card. Also, it's given that all the found cards have numbers within -x to x. My task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find to make the total sum zero.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. To make the total sum zero, we need the sum of the found cards plus the sum of the additional cards to be zero. So, the sum of the additional cards should be equal to -S. Let's denote the sum of the additional cards as T. So, T = -S.\n\nBut each additional card can contribute a value between -x and x. So, each card can add up to x in positive or negative. But since we're trying to reach T, which might be positive or negative, I need to find the minimal number of cards required.\n\nWait, but the problem says that Vanya can find any number of cards, not just the ones he has. So, the additional cards can be any values as long as they are within the x limit. So, the question is: given a target T (which is -S), what's the smallest number of terms, each between -x and x, whose sum equals T.\n\nWait no, wait. Because the sum of the additional cards must be T, right? So, for example, if the current sum S is 5, then T is -5. So, the sum of the additional cards needs to be -5. But each card can contribute at most x towards this sum. Or, perhaps, more precisely, each card can contribute up to x in absolute value towards the sum.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimal k such that |T| ≤ k * x. Because each card can contribute up to x towards the sum. So, the minimal k is the ceiling of |T| / x. Because if |T| is exactly divisible by x, then k is |T|/x. Otherwise, it's |T|/x rounded up.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor example, if |T| is 5 and x is 2. Then 5/2 is 2.5, so we need 3 cards. Because 2*2=4 is less than 5, so 3 cards are needed.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the found cards.\n2. Compute T = -S. This is the sum we need from the additional cards.\n3. Compute the absolute value of T, which is |T|.\n4. The minimal number of cards is ceil(|T| / x).\n\nBut wait, what if T is zero? Then no additional cards are needed. That's a base case.\n\nAlso, what if n is zero? Well, according to the problem statement, n is at least 1, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says n is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. So n is at least 1.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps again:\n\n- Read n and x.\n- Read the list of n integers.\n- Compute S = sum of the list.\n- Compute T = -S.\n- If T is zero, output 0.\n- Else, compute |T| divided by x, and take the ceiling if there's a remainder.\n\nWait, but in code, how do we compute the ceiling of a division?\n\nIn Python, we can compute it as (abs_T + x - 1) // x.\n\nYes, that works. For example:\n\nIf abs_T is 5, x is 2: (5 + 2 -1 ) // 2 =6//2=3.\n\nIf abs_T is 4, x is 2: (4+2-1)//2=5//2=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nCalculate the sum S of the found cards.\n\nCompute T = -S.\n\nIf T is zero: print 0.\n\nElse, compute the minimal number of cards as ceil( |T| / x ), which is (|T| + x -1 ) // x.\n\nNow, let's test this with the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2']\n\nWait, the input is two lines? Or is it one line? Wait, looking back, the user wrote:\n\nInput:\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\nWait, that's probably a mistake. Because in standard input, the first line is n and x, then the next line is the n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards (found and additional) equals zero. Each card can have a value between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: Compute the sum of the values on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Target Sum**: The target sum for the additional cards is the negative of the current sum. This ensures that when added to the current sum, the total becomes zero.\n3. **Compute Minimum Additional Cards**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed. Otherwise, calculate the absolute value of the target sum and determine how many cards are required using the formula `ceil(|target_sum| / x)`. This can be efficiently computed as `(abs(target_sum) + x - 1) // x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\nt = -s\n\nif t == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n    min_cards = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n    print(min_cards)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, n (number of found cards) and x (maximum absolute value on any card), followed by a line of n integers representing the values on the found cards.\n- **Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the found cards to determine the target sum for the additional cards.\n- **Target Adjustment**: Convert the target sum to its negative value to ensure the total sum becomes zero.\n- **Ceiling Division**: Use ceiling division to determine the minimum number of additional cards required, ensuring each card's value does not exceed x in absolute value.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures the solution is optimal and runs in constant time.",
