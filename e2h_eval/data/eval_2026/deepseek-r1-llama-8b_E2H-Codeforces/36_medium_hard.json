The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about radio towers in towns. There are n+2 towns, numbered from 0 to n+1. We build a tower in each town 1 to n with probability 1/2, independently. Then, for each built tower, we assign a signal power p (integer from 1 to n). The signal covers all towns c where |c - i| < p, where i is the tower's position.\n\nOur goal is to calculate the probability that after building the towers, we can assign the signal powers such that:\n- Towns 0 and n+1 get no signal.\n- Each of the towns 1..n gets exactly one signal.\n\nSo, the output is this probability modulo 998244353, expressed as x * y^{-1} mod MOD, where x/y is the reduced fraction.\n\nHmm. So, I need to find the number of valid subsets of towers (build or not) such that there exists an assignment of p's satisfying the constraints. Then, the probability is that count divided by 2^n, since each subset has probability (1/2)^n.\n\nThe key is to model the valid configurations. Let's think about what the configuration looks like.\n\nEach town 1..n must be covered by exactly one tower. So, for each town, there's exactly one tower that covers it, and that tower's p must be set such that the coverage includes it but doesn't spill over too much.\n\nWait, perhaps the arrangement of towers must form a certain kind of partition. Like, each tower's coverage area is a contiguous block, and these blocks cover exactly 1..n without overlapping, and without covering 0 or n+1.\n\nSo, maybe the valid configurations are those where the towers form a non-overlapping partition of 1..n into intervals, each controlled by exactly one tower whose coverage is exactly the size of the interval.\n\nWait, let's think about how the coverage works. For a tower at i with power p, it covers [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)]. But wait, because |c -i| < p means c can be i-p+1 up to i+p-1, but not including i+p because it's less than p. So the coverage is from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1), but these are integers. So for example, if i=2 and p=2, coverage is 1 and 3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, |c -i| < p is equivalent to c being in (i - p, i + p). Since c is integer, this becomes c >= i - p + 1 and c <= i + p -1.\n\nSo, for a tower at position i with power p, it covers the range [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)] inclusive.\n\nNow, the constraints are that the entire 1..n is covered exactly once by some tower, and 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\nThis seems similar to tiling the 1..n with intervals, each centered at some tower position, and the intervals don't overlap and exactly cover 1..n.\n\nWait, another way: each interval [a, b] must satisfy that a = i - (p-1) and b = i + (p-1), for some tower at i. Also, the union of these intervals must be exactly 1..n, and they must not include 0 or n+1.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of subsets S of {1, ..., n} such that S is a set of centers, and the intervals around each center in S exactly cover 1..n, without overlapping, and without touching 0 or n+1.\n\nWait, but each interval can't extend beyond 0 or n+1. So for each i in S, the coverage [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)] must be entirely within 1..n.\n\nAlternatively, the coverage intervals must fit within 1..n and not include 0 or n+1.\n\nBut how do we model this? It feels like this is similar to tiling the line with certain constraints.\n\nLet me think of this as a dynamic programming problem.\n\nLet’s define dp[i] as the number of valid configurations for the first i towns. Then, for each position i, we can consider whether it's covered by a tower placed at some j, and then see how the rest of the towns are covered.\n\nBut considering the size of n (up to 2e5), a straightforward DP approach might be too slow unless optimized properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the structure of the problem can be modeled combinatorially. Maybe the valid configurations are those that form a certain kind of structure, like a non-overlapping, consecutive arrangement of intervals.\n\nAnother thought: the coverage of each tower must form a contiguous interval. So the entire 1..n is partitioned into such intervals. Each interval's length is determined by its tower's power.\n\nWait, but the length is 2*(p-1)+1? Because from i-(p-1) to i+(p-1) is 2p-1 towns. Or wait, the number of towns covered is (p-1)*2 + 1? For example, p=1 covers 1 town. p=2 covers 3 towns, etc. So the length of the interval is 2p-1.\n\nSo, each interval in the partition has a length that is an odd number. So, the sum of the lengths of the intervals must be equal to n.\n\nBut n could be even or odd. Wait, but each interval contributes an odd length. The sum of k odd numbers is even if k is even, odd if k is odd. So, for the sum to be n, which can be even or odd, the number of intervals must have the same parity as n.\n\nBut this is just a necessary condition, not sufficient.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the number of ways to partition 1..n into a set of intervals, each of which is of odd length, and each starting and ending in such a way that their combined coverage does not include 0 or n+1.\n\nMoreover, each interval corresponds to a tower placement. So, for each interval [a, b], there must be exactly one tower in this interval, and it's placed at the center (or perhaps somewhere else, but probably the center).\n\nWait, the center is not necessarily the case. For example, if the interval is [1,3], the possible positions for the tower are 1, 2, or 3. If the tower is at 1, p must be 2 (covers 1 and 2). If it's at 2, p is 2 (covers 1,2,3). If it's at 3, p is 1 (covers only 3). Wait, but wait:\n\nIf the interval is [1,3], and the tower is at 1, p must be 2. Because 1 is the left end, so |c-1| < 2 → c can be 0 (excluded) or 1, 2. So coverage is 1 and 2. But then, 3 is not covered. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify.\n\nFor a tower at i with power p, it covers [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)]. But for this to include the entire interval [a, b], the tower must be placed such that a = i - (p-1), and b = i + (p-1).\n\nSo for the interval [a, b], the tower must be placed at a + (b - a + 1)/2, since (b - a + 1) must be 2(p-1) + 1 → p = (b - a + 1 +1)/2. Wait, wait:\n\nWait, the interval length is (b - a + 1). This must be equal to 2(p-1) + 1, because each p gives an interval of length 2p-1. So:\n\np = (b - a + 1 + 1)/2 = (b - a + 2)/2.\n\nWhich implies that the interval length must be odd. Because (b-a+1) is 2k-1, so p = (2k-1 + 2)/2 = k.\n\nSo, for any interval [a, b], the length is odd. So, when we partition 1..n into intervals of odd lengths, each interval corresponds to exactly one possible tower placement (the middle of the interval) and a specific p.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to partition 1..n into a set of non-overlapping, contiguous intervals of odd lengths, each exactly covering their respective intervals, and ensuring that the entire 1..n is covered.\n\nAdditionally, the first interval must start at 1, and the last interval must end at n.\n\nMoreover, the intervals must not include 0 or n+1. So, the first interval starts at 1, and the last ends at n.\n\nSo, the number of valid configurations is equal to the number of compositions of n into parts of odd size, where the order matters. Because each composition corresponds to a way to split the line into such intervals.\n\nWait, yes! Because each part is a segment of odd length, and the sum is n. So, the number of such compositions is the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nWait, the number of ways to partition a number m into a sum of odd numbers is equal to the number of compositions using only odd parts. And that's known to be the (m)th Fibonacci number. Let me check:\n\nWait, for m=1: only one way (just 1). Fib(1)=1.\nm=2: can't be written as sum of odds. So zero ways. But Fib(2) is 1. Hmm, maybe it's shifted.\n\nWait, maybe it's the (m+1)th Fib number?\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me see for small m:\n\nm=1: 1 way (1).\nm=2: 0 ways.\nm=3: 1 way (3), or 1+1+1. Wait, no, 1+1+1 is allowed but that's three parts. Or is it? Wait, each part is odd, but the order matters. So for m=3, the compositions are: [3], [1,1,1]. But wait, [1,1,1] is a composition into 3 ones. So that's two ways.\n\nWait, no, wait: 3 can be composed as 3, or 1+2 (but 2 is even, so no), or 2+1 (same issue). So only one composition: [3]. Or am I wrong?\n\nWait, no. Wait, for m=3, the possible compositions with all parts odd are:\n\n- 3\n- 1 + 1 + 1\n\nIs that correct? Yes, because each part is odd.\n\nSo for m=3, there are two compositions.\n\nSimilarly, m=4: the possible compositions into odd parts are:\n\n1+1+1+1, 3+1, 1+3. So three ways.\n\nWait, but 3+1 is a valid composition, as 3 and 1 are both odd. So yes, three ways.\n\nHmm, now, for m=1, f(m) = 1; m=2, f(m)=0; m=3, f(m)=2; m=4, f(m)=3; m=5, f(m)=5.\n\nThis looks like the Fibonacci sequence, but shifted. Because:\n\nf(1) = 1\n\nf(2) = 0\n\nf(3) = 2 = f(2)+f(1)\n\nf(4) = 3 = f(3)+f(2)\n\nf(5) = 5 = f(4)+f(3)\n\nYes, this follows the Fibonacci sequence, where f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2), with base cases f(1)=1, f(2)=0.\n\nSo, the number of compositions of m into odd parts is equal to the (m)th term in this sequence. So for n, the number of valid configurations is f(n), where f(n) follows f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), with f(1)=1, f(2)=0.\n\nWait, but wait, earlier when m=3, f(3) was 2, which is f(2) + f(1) = 0 + 1 =1. No, that contradicts.\n\nWait, maybe I got the recurrence wrong. Let me re-calculate.\n\nLooking back, for m=1: 1 way.\n\nm=2: 0.\n\nm=3: 2.\n\nm=4: 3.\n\nm=5: 5.\n\nSo, m=3: f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 0 +1 =1, but actual value is 2. So perhaps the recurrence is different.\n\nWait, maybe the correct recurrence is f(m) = f(m-2) + f(m-1). Or maybe it's f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2), but with a different initial condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to model the number of compositions as the (m)th Fibonacci number, but starting from a different point.\n\nWait, perhaps f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(3)=2, f(4)=3, f(5)=5.\n\nThat would fit the Fibonacci sequence starting from f(1)=1, f(2)=1, etc.\n\nBut why?\n\nLet me think recursively. How can I express f(m) in terms of smaller f's.\n\nSuppose I have a composition of m into odd parts. The first part can be 1, 3, 5, etc., up to m (if m is odd). For each choice of the first part k (odd, 1<=k<=m), the remaining m-k can be composed in f(m-k) ways. So, f(m) = sum_{k is odd, 1<=k<=m} f(m-k).\n\nBut for k=1, f(m-1) is added.\n\nFor k=3, f(m-3) is added.\n\nEtc.\n\nBut how does this relate to the Fibonacci sequence?\n\nWait, let's compute f(1) through f(6):\n\nf(1) = 1.\n\nf(2) = 0.\n\nf(3) = f(2) + f(0) ? Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the recurrence is f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2), but with different initial conditions.\n\nWait, for m=3, f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 0 +1=1, but earlier calculation says f(3)=2. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me try to find a generating function.\n\nThe generating function for the number of compositions into odd parts is x/(1 - x^2). Because each part is 1, 3, 5, etc., and each can be used any number of times, but the order matters.\n\nSo the generating function G(x) = sum_{m=0}^\\infty f(m) x^m = x/(1 -x^2).\n\nBecause each part contributes x, x^3, x^5, etc., and the generating function for each part is x/(1 -x^2), and since compositions allow any number of parts, the overall generating function is x/(1 - x^2).\n\nSo expanding this:\n\nG(x) = x/(1 -x^2) = x + x^3 + x^5 + x^7 + ... \n\nWhich means f(0) =0, f(1)=1, f(2)=0, f(3)=1, f(4)=0, f(5)=1, etc. That can't be right because earlier calculations show f(3)=2.\n\nWait, that suggests I'm misunderstanding the problem. Because according to this, the number of compositions of 3 into odd parts is 1, but earlier thinking said it's 2.\n\nWait, perhaps my confusion arises from the definition of 'compositions'. A composition is a way of writing a number as the sum of positive integers, where the order matters. So for m=3, the compositions into odd parts are:\n\n- 3.\n\n- 1 + 1 + 1.\n\nSo that's two compositions, not one. So why does the generating function give f(3)=1?\n\nAh, I think I see. The generating function counts the number of compositions into odd parts, but each part is considered as contributing x^{k}, where k is odd. So, for example, for m=3, the generating function would include x^3 (from the single part 3) and x^1 * x^1 * x^1 (from 1+1+1). But that's x^3 and x^3, so the coefficient for x^3 is 2.\n\nWait, no, wait. Each part contributes x^{k}, so for the composition 3, it's x^3. For 1+1+1, it's x^1 * x^1 * x^1 = x^3. So the total contribution is 2*x^3. So f(3) is 2, which aligns with our initial calculation.\n\nBut according to the generating function G(x) = x/(1 -x^2) = x + x^3 + x^5 + ..., the coefficient of x^3 is 1. So that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the generating function approach. Because if each part is allowed to be any odd number, including multiple times, the generating function should be the sum over all possible numbers of parts, each part being odd. So for each part, it's x + x^3 + x^5 + ... and the generating function is (x + x^3 + x^5 + ...) ) * (1 + (x + x^3 + x^5 + ...) ) * (1 + (x + x^3 + x^5 + ...) )^2 * ... etc.\n\nWhich is actually G(x) = (x/(1 - x^2)) / (1 - G(x)) ), because each part is a choice of any number of terms, each of which is an odd part.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting stuck. Let me instead look for a recurrence relation for f(m).\n\nLet’s think about f(m) as the number of compositions into odd parts.\n\nFor a composition of m, the first term can be 1, 3, 5, etc.\n\nSuppose the first term is k (an odd number ≥1). Then, the remaining sum is m -k, which can be composed in f(m -k) ways.\n\nSo f(m) = sum_{k is odd, 1 ≤k ≤m} f(m -k).\n\nBut let's see:\n\nFor m=1: f(1) = f(0) =1 (since m-k=0, f(0) is 1? Or maybe f(0)=1? Because the empty composition is one way.)\n\nWait, for m=1, the first term is 1, and the remaining is 0, which has f(0)=1. So f(1) =1.\n\nFor m=2: the first term can be 1, leading to f(1)=1. Or 3 is larger than 2, so only k=1. So f(2) = f(1) =1. But earlier thinking said f(2) is 0. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps f(0)=1 is the base case. Then, for m≥1:\n\nf(m) = sum_{k is odd, 1 ≤k ≤m} f(m -k).\n\nSo:\n\nf(0) =1.\n\nf(1) = f(0) =1.\n\nf(2) = f(1) =1.\n\nf(3) = f(2) + f(0) =1 +1=2.\n\nf(4) = f(3) + f(1) =2+1=3.\n\nf(5) = f(4) + f(2) + f(0) =3+1+1=5.\n\nf(6) = f(5) + f(3) + f(1) =5+2+1=8.\n\nThis seems to match the earlier examples.\n\nSo, f(m) follows the Fibonacci sequence, where f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2), with f(0)=1, f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(3)=2, etc.\n\nWait, no, because:\n\nf(3)=2 = f(2) + f(1) =1+1=2.\n\nf(4)=3 = f(3) + f(2)=2+1=3.\n\nf(5)=5=3+2=5.\n\nf(6)=8=5+3=8.\n\nYes, so the recurrence is f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2), with f(0)=1, f(1)=1.\n\nSo, for m ≥2, f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2).\n\nThus, the number of valid configurations is f(n), where f(n) is the nth term in this Fibonacci-like sequence.\n\nBut wait, earlier when m=2, the number of compositions into odd parts is 1 (only 1+1), but according to f(2) as per the recurrence, it's 1. So that matches.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, for n=2, the answer was 1/4. The number of valid configurations is 1, because only the subset {1,2} is valid. So the count is 1, and 1/4 is the probability.\n\nBut according to the problem, for n=2, the valid configurations are when both 1 and 2 are present. So f(2) is 1, which aligns with the count.\n\nSo, the general formula is that the number of valid configurations is f(n), where f(n) is defined as the (n)th term in the Fibonacci sequence starting with f(0)=1, f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(3)=2, etc.\n\nWait, let's compute f(0)=1, f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(3)=2, f(4)=3, f(5)=5, f(6)=8, etc. So it's the standard Fibonacci numbers, offset by some indices.\n\nWait, the standard Fibonacci sequence is usually defined as F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, etc. So f(n) in our case equals F(n), the nth Fibonacci number.\n\nBecause:\n\nf(0)=1=F(2)?\n\nNo, because F(2) is 1, but f(0) is 1.\n\nWait, perhaps f(n) is equal to F(n+1), where F is the standard Fibonacci sequence.\n\nWait:\n\nStandard Fibonacci:\n\nF(0)=0\n\nF(1)=1\n\nF(2)=1\n\nF(3)=2\n\nF(4)=3\n\nF(5)=5\n\nF(6)=8\n\nOur f(n):\n\nf(0)=1 → F(2)=1\n\nf(1)=1 → F(2)=1\n\nf(2)=1 → F(3)=2? No, that's 2, which doesn't match.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of f(n) = F(n+1), but that may not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(n) = F(n), with F(0)=1, F(1)=1, F(2)=2, F(3)=3, etc. But that doesn't fit either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(n) is the (n)th term in the Fibonacci sequence starting from F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, etc. So f(n) = F(n), with F(1)=1.\n\nIn this case, for n=2, f(n)=1, which matches the problem's example.\n\nSo, the number of valid configurations is f(n) = F(n), where F(n) is the nth Fibonacci number with F(1)=1, F(2)=1, etc.\n\nThus, the solution is to compute f(n) = F(n), and then the probability is f(n) / 2^n.\n\nSo, the task reduces to computing F(n) modulo 998244353, and 2^n modulo MOD, then compute (F(n) * inverse(2^n)) mod MOD.\n\nBut wait, for n=0, f(0)=1, but in the problem statement, n is at least 1.\n\nSo, for n=1, the number of configurations is 1. Because you must have a tower in 1, and p=1. So, the configuration is just {1}.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the nth Fibonacci number F(n), where F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, etc.\n\n2. Compute 2^n modulo MOD.\n\n3. Compute the modular inverse of 2^n modulo MOD.\n\n4. Multiply F(n) by the inverse of 2^n modulo MOD, and output the result.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, we need to compute this efficiently.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the Fibonacci numbers up to 2e5 using O(n) time and space.\n\n- Precompute the powers of 2 up to 2e5, modulo MOD.\n\n- Precompute the modular inverses of these powers, perhaps using Fermat's little theorem, since MOD is a prime.\n\nWait, MOD is 998244353, which is a prime. So, the inverse of 2^k is pow(2, MOD-2 -k, MOD), because 2^k * 2^(MOD-2 -k) ≡ 1 mod MOD.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the inverse of 2^k is (2^k)^(MOD-2) mod MOD, because for a prime MOD, the inverse of a is a^(MOD-2) mod MOD.\n\nYes. So, the inverse of 2^k is pow(2, MOD-2 -k, MOD)? No, that's not right. Wait, 2^k mod MOD is some value, say x. The inverse is x^(MOD-2) mod MOD.\n\nSo, for each k, inv_2k = pow(2, k, MOD) ^ (MOD-2) mod MOD.\n\nBut calculating this for each k up to 2e5 is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, note that inv_2k = pow(2, MOD-2, MOD)^k mod MOD. Because (2^k) * (2^{-1})^k = 1.\n\nWait, 2^{-1} mod MOD is inv_2 = 499122177.\n\nSo, inv_2k = (inv_2)^k mod MOD.\n\nYes, because (2^k) * (inv_2)^k = (2 * inv_2)^k = 1^k =1 mod MOD.\n\nSo, inv_2k is equal to pow(inv_2, k, MOD).\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCompute F(n) mod MOD.\n\nCompute pow(2, n, MOD).\n\nCompute inv_2 = 499122177.\n\nCompute inv_2_pow_n = pow(inv_2, n, MOD).\n\nThen, the result is (F(n) * inv_2_pow_n) mod MOD.\n\nWait, because the probability is F(n) / 2^n = F(n) * inv(2^n) mod MOD.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute F(n) as the nth Fibonacci number, starting with F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, etc.\n\n- Compute 2^n mod MOD.\n\n- Compute inv_2^n mod MOD, which is inv_2 raised to n mod MOD.\n\n- Multiply F(n) by inv_2^n mod MOD, and output.\n\nNow, implementing this:\n\nWe'll read n from input, compute F(n), compute 2^n, compute inv_2^n, multiply F(n) * inv_2^n mod MOD.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, this is feasible.\n\nNow, let's test for n=2.\n\nF(2) =1.\n\n2^2=4.\n\ninv_2=499122177.\n\ninv_2^2= (499122177)^2 mod MOD. Let's compute 499122177^2 mod MOD.\n\nBut 499122177 is 2^{-1} mod MOD. So, 499122177^2 mod MOD is 499122177, because 2*499122177=1 mod MOD. So 499122177^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 mod MOD.\n\nSo, for n=2, the probability is F(2) * (1/4) mod MOD.\n\nF(2) is 1, so 1/4 mod MOD is 748683265, which matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code will correctly handle this.\n\nAnother sample: n=3.\n\nF(3)=2.\n\n2^3=8.\n\ninv_8 is 124780545.\n\n2 * inv_8 = 249561090 mod MOD.\n\nWhich is 249561090.\n\nBut 2/8 = 1/4, so 2*(1/8) = 1/4. Wait, but 2/8 is 1/4.\n\nWait, no, wait:\n\nWait, F(3) is 2. So 2 / 8 = 1/4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code will output 748683265, which matches the sample.\n\nSo, the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python:\n\nWe'll precompute the Fibonacci sequence up to 2e5.\n\nWe can do this with a loop, initializing a, b as F(1)=1 and F(2)=1, then for each step, compute the next F(n).\n\nBut for n=1, F(n) is 1.\n\nSo, for n=1, the code returns 1 * inv(2) mod MOD.\n\nWhich is 499122177.\n\nWhich is correct because for n=1, the only valid configuration is having the tower in 1, with p=1. So the probability is 1/2.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the sample for n=2 is 1/4, which is correct.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nRead n.\n\nCompute F(n) mod MOD.\n\nCompute pow_2 = pow(2, n, MOD).\n\nCompute inv_2_pow_n = pow(499122177, n, MOD).\n\nResult is (F(n) * inv_2_pow_n) % MOD.\n\nPrint the result.\n\nSo, the code will be something like:\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n == 0:\n    # but n >=1, so skip\n    pass\n\n# compute F(n)\nif n == 1:\n    fib = 1\nelif n ==2:\n    fib =1\nelse:\n    a, b = 1,1\n    for _ in range(3, n+1):\n        c = (a + b) % MOD\n        a, b = b, c\n    fib = b\n\npow_2 = pow(2, n, MOD)\ninv_2 = 499122177\ninv_2_pow_n = pow(inv_2, n, MOD)\n\nans = (fib * inv_2_pow_n) % MOD\nprint(ans)\n\nWait, but for n=1, F(n) is 1.\n\nTesting for n=1:\n\nfib is 1.\n\npow_2 is 2.\n\ninv_2_pow_n is 499122177.\n\n1 * 499122177 mod MOD is 499122177, which is 1/2 mod MOD. Which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, fib is 1, 1 * inv_2^2 = 748683265.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that we can set the signal powers of radio towers such that each town from 1 to n gets exactly one signal, while towns 0 and n+1 get none. This probability should be computed modulo 998244353.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - We need to ensure that each town from 1 to n is covered by exactly one tower's signal.\n   - The signal coverage of a tower at position i with power p covers the range [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)].\n   - The valid configurations form non-overlapping intervals covering the entire range from 1 to n.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Insight**:\n   - The number of valid configurations can be modeled using Fibonacci numbers. Specifically, the nth number in this sequence, where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms, starting from F(1) = 1 and F(2) = 1.\n\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**:\n   - Compute the nth Fibonacci number modulo 998244353.\n   - Compute the modular inverse of 2^n using Fermat's Little Theorem since 998244353 is a prime number.\n\n4. **Efficient Computation**:\n   - Precompute the Fibonacci sequence up to n using an iterative approach.\n   - Use modular exponentiation to compute powers of 2 and their modular inverses efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n == 1:\n    fib = 1\nelif n == 2:\n    fib = 1\nelse:\n    a, b = 1, 1\n    for _ in range(3, n + 1):\n        c = (a + b) % MOD\n        a, b = b, c\n    fib = b\n\npow_2 = pow(2, n, MOD)\ninv_2 = 499122177  # Modular inverse of 2 modulo 998244353\ninv_2_pow_n = pow(inv_2, n, MOD)\n\nans = (fib * inv_2_pow_n) % MOD\nprint(ans)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Fibonacci Calculation**: The code iteratively computes the nth Fibonacci number starting from F(1) = 1 and F(2) = 1. This is done in O(n) time complexity.\n- **Modular Exponentiation**: The power of 2 and its modular inverse are computed using Python's built-in `pow` function with three arguments, which efficiently handles large exponents and modular arithmetic.\n- **Result Calculation**: The final result is obtained by multiplying the nth Fibonacci number with the modular inverse of 2^n, then taking the result modulo 998244353.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the constraints effectively, providing the correct probability for any valid input within the given limits.",
