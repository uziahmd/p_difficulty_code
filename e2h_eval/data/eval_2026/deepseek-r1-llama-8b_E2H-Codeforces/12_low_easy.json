The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Xenia is trying to complete her tasks by moving along a ringroad. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem statement says that Xenia lives in a city with n houses arranged in a ring. The traffic is one-way and clockwise. She starts at house 1 and has m tasks. For each task i, she needs to be at house a_i. But not just that—she also has to complete all tasks with numbers less than i. So for the first task (i=1), she must be at a_1, then for the second task, she must be at a_2 after the first is done, and so on.\n\nWait, wait. Oh right, no—the description says she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me read that again.\n\nNo, it says: \"to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\" Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Or perhaps, the way it's phrased, she has to process the tasks in order. So for each i from 1 to m, she must be present at a_i before handling the next task. But the initial position is house 1.\n\nSo the sequence is: start at 1, then go to a_1, then a_2, etc., but she can't skip any steps. Because each task depends on completing the previous ones.\n\nWait, but the actual movement isn't necessarily visiting each a_i in order. Because the ring is circular, maybe there's a smarter way to move. For example, if she has to go from a_i to a_j where j is after i, perhaps she can loop around the ring in a way that covers multiple steps efficiently.\n\nHmm, but how do we model this? Maybe the key is to determine the earliest time she arrives at each a_i, considering that she has to reach a_1 first, then a_2, etc., but each step must be processed in order.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the tasks are given in order, and for each task i, she must be at a_i. The starting point is 1. Then, she has to go from 1 to a_1, then from a_1 to a_2, and so on until a_m.\n\nWait, but that can't be entirely correct because she might have to pass through some points more than once. Like, for example, if a_i is 3 and a_j is 2, and they are in order, she might have to go from 3 back to 2, which would add some steps.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal path is to process each a_i in order, moving from the current position to the next required a_i, regardless of the direction. Because each step must be taken sequentially.\n\nSo, the total time is the sum of the distances between consecutive a's, considering the ring structure.\n\nWait, let's take the sample input:\n\nIn the first test case, the input is 4 3, and the tasks are 3,2,3.\n\nShe starts at 1. She needs to go to 3 first. Since the ring is 1→2→3→4→1, moving from 1 to 3 is two steps (1→2→3). Then, from 3 to 2. On the ring, moving clockwise, 3 is followed by 4, then 1, then 2. So from 3 to 2 is three steps (3→4→1→2). Then, from 2 to 3 is one step (2→3). So adding up: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6 steps, which matches the sample output.\n\nWait, but the sample explanation says the sequence is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's count that: 1 to 2 is 1 step, 2 to 3 is 1, 3 to 4 is 1, 4 to 1 is 1, 1 to 2 is 1, 2 to 3 is 1. Total 6 steps. That's the same as the other approach.\n\nHmm, so the total time is the sum of the distances between each consecutive pair of a_i's, considering the minimal path on the ring. But since the ring is a cycle, the minimal distance between two points a and b is min( (b - a) % n, (a - b) % n )? No, wait. Because the ring is a single cycle, moving clockwise, the distance from a to b is (b - a) if a < b, else (n - a + b). Or, more accurately, the minimal steps when moving",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a ring-shaped road. Each task must be completed in order, and she starts at house 1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia can only move clockwise around the ring. The distance between two houses `a` and `b` can be calculated as the minimal steps needed to move from `a` to `b` in a clockwise direction.\n2. **Task Completion Order**: Xenia must complete each task in the given order, starting from house 1. For each subsequent task, she moves from the current house to the required house for the next task.\n3. **Summing Distances**: The total time required is the sum of the distances between each consecutive pair of required houses. Since the ring is circular, the distance from house `a` to house `b` is calculated as `(b - a) % n`, ensuring we get the shortest path in the clockwise direction.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprev = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor current in tasks:\n    # Calculate the distance from prev to current\n    distance = (current - prev) % n\n    total_time += distance\n    prev = current\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: We read the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`, followed by the list of task locations.\n2. **Initial Position**: Start from house 1.\n3. **Iterate Through Tasks**: For each task location, calculate the distance from the previous house to the current task location using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ring.\n4. **Update Time**: Add each calculated distance to the total time.\n5. **Output Result**: Print the accumulated total time after completing all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal time required by summing the shortest paths between consecutive task locations, considering the circular nature of the ring.",
