And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. Hmm, let's see what the problem says.\n\nThe input is n and k, where n is the number of days and k is the number of consecutive days considered a week. Then there's a list of n integers representing each day's sleep time. My task is to compute the average over all possible weeks. Oh right, because each week is a window of k days, and there are (n - k + 1) such windows.\n\nWait, how do I approach this efficiently? Let's think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, for each window of size k, I need to sum up the sleep times in that window and then compute the average by dividing the total sum by the number of windows.\n\nBut if I do it naively, like sliding a window across the array each time and summing, that would be O(nk) time. But since n can be up to 2e5, that might be too slow. So I need a more efficient way.\n\nOh right! The sliding window technique with a prefix sum array can help here. Let me recall: the prefix sum array allows me to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time.\n\nSo first, I'll create a prefix sum array where prefix[i] is the sum of the first i elements. Then, the sum of a window from index j to j+k-1 is prefix[j+k-1] - prefix[j-1]. But wait, I have to handle cases where j is 0.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to precompute the total sum of all elements and then for each window, subtract the sums of the elements before and after. But I'm not sure how that would work for all windows.\n\nWait, perhaps using a sliding window with a fixed window size can be done efficiently. Let's see:\n\nInitialize a variable current_sum which holds the sum of the first k elements. Then, for each subsequent window, we subtract the element leaving the window (the leftmost element) and add the new element entering the window (the rightmost). This way, each window's sum is computed in O(1) time, leading to an overall O(n) solution.\n\nYes, that's better. So the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and k.\n2. Read the array a.\n3. Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n4. Add this sum to a running total.\n5. Then, for each position from k to n-1:\n   a. Subtract the element leaving the window (a[i - k]) from current_sum.\n   b. Add the new element (a[i]) to current_sum.\n   c. Add current_sum to the running total.\n6. After processing all windows, divide the total sum by the number of windows to get the average.\n7. Output the result with at least six decimal places.\n\nWait, but wait—what if k is equal to n? Then there's only one window, the entire array, and the average is just the sum divided by 1.\n\nAlso, when initializing current_sum, I should ensure that if k is larger than n, but according to the constraints, k <= n, so that's covered.\n\nLet me test this logic with the example given.\n\nIn the third example input:\n8 2\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nThe windows are:\n1+2 = 3\n2+4 = 6\n4+100000 = 100004\n100000+123 = 100123\n123+456 = 579\n456+789 = 1245\n789+1 = 790\n\nAdding these: 3+6=9, 9+100004=100013, 100013+100123=200136, +579=200715, +1245=201960, +790=202750.\n\nTotal sum is 202750. Number of windows is 8-2+1=7. So average is 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857..., which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the sliding window approach works.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead n and k from input. Then read the list a.\n\nCompute the initial sum: sum(a[0:k]).\n\nThen, for i in range(k, n):\n    current_sum += a[i] - a[i - k]\n    total += current_sum\n\nWait, no: initially, the first window is a[0..k-1], so after computing its sum, we add to total. Then for each i starting at k, the next window is a[1..k], then a[2..k+1], etc.\n\nSo yes, the loop starts at i=k, and for each step, subtract a[i - k], add a[i], update current_sum, add to total.\n\nOnce all windows are processed,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks based on a given sequence of sleep times for consecutive days. Each week is defined as a window of `k` consecutive days, and there are `n - k + 1` such windows in total.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves using a sliding window technique to efficiently compute the sum of sleep times for each window of size `k`. This method ensures that each element is processed in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(n).\n\n1. **Read Input**: Read the values of `n` (number of days) and `k` (window size), followed by the list of sleep times.\n2. **Initialize Variables**: Compute the sum of the first window of size `k` and initialize the total sum of all windows.\n3. **Sliding Window Technique**: For each subsequent window, update the current sum by subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters the window. Add this current sum to the total sum.\n4. **Calculate Average**: Divide the total sum by the number of windows to get the average sleep time.\n5. **Output Result**: Print the average with at least six decimal places.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ntotal = 0\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\ntotal += current_sum\n\nfor i in range(k, n):\n    current_sum += a[i] - a[i - k]\n    total += current_sum\n\naverage = total / (n - k + 1)\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input values are read and parsed into appropriate variables.\n- **Initial Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first window (first `k` elements) is computed and added to the total sum.\n- **Sliding Window Update**: For each subsequent window, the current sum is updated by removing the leftmost element of the previous window and adding the new rightmost element. This ensures each update is done in constant time.\n- **Average Calculation**: The total sum of all window sums is divided by the number of windows to compute the average sleep time, which is then formatted and printed to ensure precision up to ten decimal places.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem constraints and ensures that the solution is both optimal and easy to understand.",
