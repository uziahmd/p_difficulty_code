And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the average sleep time per week for Polycarp based on his sleep records over n days. Each week consists of k consecutive days. So there are (n - k + 1) possible weeks. For each week, we sum the sleep times of those k days and then compute the average by dividing the total sum by the number of weeks.\n\nHmm, right. The input gives n and k, followed by a list of a1 to an. The output should be the average with at least six decimal places.\n\nLet's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to process all possible consecutive k-day windows in the array a. For each window, calculate the sum of its elements, add all these sums together, and then divide by the number of windows to get the average.\n\nBut wait, if n is up to 2e5, doing this naively by iterating through each window and summing each time would take O(nk) time, which could be up to 2e10 operations. That's way too slow for Python; it won't handle that in reasonable time.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way to compute the sums. Oh right, the sliding window technique can help here. Because each new window only adds one element and removes the first element from the previous window.\n\nWait, but the sliding window for sum works when we can compute the current sum quickly. So the initial sum is the sum of the first k elements. Then, for each subsequent window, subtract the element leaving the window and add the new element entering.\n\nYes, that's the way to go. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Read n, k and the array a.\n2. Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n3. The total sum starts as this initial sum.\n4. Then, for each i from k to n-1:\n   a. Subtract a[i - k] from the current sum.\n   b. Add a[i] to the current sum.\n   c. Add this new current sum to the total sum.\n5. After processing all windows, divide the total sum by the number of windows (n - k + 1) to get the average.\n6. Output the result with six decimal places.\n\nWait, no. Because each window contributes its sum to the total, which is then divided by the number of windows. So the total sum is the sum of all individual window sums.\n\nSo yes, the initial sum is the first window, then for each next window, we update the current sum and add it to the total.\n\nThat makes sense. So the algorithm is O(n) time, which is acceptable for n=2e5.\n\nNow, considering the data types: since the numbers can be up to 1e5 and n is up to 2e5, the maximum sum could be up to 2e10. Summed over 2e5 windows, the total sum could be up to 2e15, which fits into a 64-bit integer, so using integers for the sum is okay.\n\nIn Python, integers can handle that without any issues.\n\nThen, after computing the total, we need to compute the average as total / (n - k + 1). We have to make sure to output this with at least six decimal places.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the third case has 8 days, k=2, so 7 weeks. The sum is 1+2+4+100000+123+456+789+1. Wait, no, wait. Wait, n is 8, k is 2, so the windows are [1,2], [2,4], [4,100000], etc., up to [1,8]. So the sum is 3 + 6 + ... etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nLooking at the first sample:\n\nInput is 3 2, and a = [3,4,7].\n\nThe windows are [3,4] and [4,7]. Their sums are 7 and 11. Total is 18. Divided by 2 weeks, average is 9.0. So output is 9.0000000000.\n\nYes, that matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: input is 1 1, a is [10]. Only one window, so average is 10.0.\n\nThird sample: 8 2, a is [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]. So 7 windows.\n\nCompute each window sum:\n\n1+2 =3\n\n2+4=6\n\n4+100000=100004\n\n100000+123=100123\n\n123+456=579\n\n456+789=1245\n\n789+1=790\n\nWait, no. Wait, the windows are:\n\n1-2:",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time per week for Polycarp based on his sleep records over n days. Each week consists of k consecutive days, and we need to compute the average over all possible weeks formed by these consecutive days.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We are given a sequence of sleep times for n days and need to find the average sleep time per week. A week is defined as any k consecutive days. The number of such weeks is (n - k + 1).\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**: To efficiently compute the sum of each window of k days, we use the sliding window technique. This allows us to compute the sum in O(n) time complexity, which is efficient for large values of n.\n3. **Sum Calculation**: \n   - Compute the sum of the first window of k days.\n   - For each subsequent window, update the current sum by subtracting the element that is leaving the window and adding the new element that is entering the window.\n4. **Total Sum and Average**: Maintain a running total of all window sums. After processing all windows, divide the total sum by the number of windows to get the average sleep time per week.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    k = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))\n    \n    total_sum = 0\n    current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n    total_sum = current_sum\n    num_windows = 1\n    \n    for i in range(k, n):\n        current_sum += a[i] - a[i - k]\n        total_sum += current_sum\n        num_windows += 1\n    \n    average = total_sum / num_windows\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into integers and a list of sleep times.\n- **Initial Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first window of k days is computed and stored as the initial current sum.\n- **Sliding Window Update**: For each subsequent day, the current sum is updated by adding the new day's sleep time and subtracting the sleep time of the day that is no longer in the window.\n- **Total Sum and Average Calculation**: The total sum of all window sums is maintained, and after processing all windows, the average is computed by dividing the total sum by the number of windows.\n- **Output**: The result is formatted to ensure it meets the precision requirement of six decimal places.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem constraints and ensures that the solution is computed in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes.",
