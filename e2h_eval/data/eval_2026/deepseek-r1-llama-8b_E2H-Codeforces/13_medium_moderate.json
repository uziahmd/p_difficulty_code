For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine whether a given triad is major, minor, or strange. Hmm, let's break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the problem statement says that a major triad has notes X, Y, Z such that when ordered correctly, the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones and Y to Z is 3 semitones. So the total is 7 semitones. For a minor triad, it's the opposite: X to Y is 3 semitones and Y to Z is 4, making a total of 7 as well. But wait, no, because 3+4 is 7, same as major. Oh right, but the order matters for how we arrange them.\n\nSo the approach is to generate all possible orderings of the three notes, calculate the distances between each consecutive pair in each permutation, and see if any permutation satisfies the major or minor condition.\n\nBut wait, the notes are cyclic. So after H comes C again. So I need a way to compute the distance between any two notes correctly considering this cyclicity.\n\nLet me think about the note order. The notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait—wait, the problem statement lists the notes as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, but in the example, the third note in the input is 'A B H', which is one of the test cases. So the order is correct, with H being last before wrapping around to C.\n\nWait, but sometimes I've heard H as being equivalent to B, but according to the problem, it's considered a distinct note here. So the list is 12 notes, in the given order.\n\nSo first, I'll represent each note as its position in this list. Let's assign each note a number from 0 to 11. So:\n\nC = 0\nC# = 1\nD = 2\nD# = 3\nE =4 \nF=5\nF#=6\nG=7\nG#=8\nA=9\nB=10\nH=11\n\nYes, that's the order given.\n\nNow, for any two notes, their distance can be calculated as (y - x) mod 12, but since the distance is measured from lower to higher, it's the positive difference. So for example, the distance from H (11) to C (0) is 1 semitone. Because H is followed by C, so the step is 1 semitone.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the distance is always taken from the lower to the higher note. So for two notes, the distance is (y - x) if y > x, else (12 - (x - y)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute the semitone distance as (y - x + 12) % 12. Because if y < x, adding 12 makes it positive, then mod 12 gives the correct distance.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor example, C to E is 4 semitones. C is 0, E is 4. So (4-0)=4.\n\nIf E to C: (0 -4) is -4. Adding 12 gives 8, mod 12 is 8. Which is correct because the distance from E to C is 8 semitones.\n\nYes, so the distance from X to Y is (Y_pos - X_pos) % 12. But wait, because the problem defines the distance as the number of semitones from the lower to higher note. So for X and Y, if Y is higher than X, it's (Y - X), else (Y + 12 - X). So the formula is (Y - X + 12) % 12. Because if Y < X, Y -X is negative, adding 12 makes it positive, and mod 12 gives the correct value.\n\nSo for each pair, the distance is (y - x + 12) % 12.\n\nWait, let me test some examples.\n\nExample 1: C to E is 4 semitones. (4-0) mod 12 =4.\n\nE to C is (0-4) mod 12= 8? Wait, no. Because (0-4) is -4, adding 12 gives 8. So yes, (0-4 +12) mod 12 is 8.\n\nAnother example: H (11) to C (0) is 1 semitone. (0 - 11) is -11. Add 12: 1. Mod 12 is 1. Correct.\n\nYes, so the distance function is (y - x + 12) % 12.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read the three notes as strings.\n\n2. Convert each note into its corresponding position number (e.g., C is 0, etc.)\n\n3. Generate all possible permutations of these three notes. Since the triad is unordered, but we need to consider all orderings to find the correct arrangement.\n\nWait, but since the set is unordered, the order in which we arrange the notes could affect whether they form a major or minor triad. So for each permutation of the three notes, we can check if any permutation satisfies the major or minor conditions.\n\nWait, but what's the condition for a major triad? It's that in some ordering, the distance between the first and second is 4, and between the second and third is 3, making a total of 7.\n\nSimilarly, for minor, the first and second must be 3 apart, and the second and third 4 apart.\n\nSo for each permutation (x, y, z) of the three notes, compute d1 = distance(x, y), d2 = distance(y, z), d3 = distance(z, x). Well, not sure if d3 is needed, but for the problem, only d1 and d2 matter.\n\nSo for a permutation (a, b, c):\n\nCompute d_ab = (b - a + 12) % 12\n\nd_bc = (c - b + 12) %12\n\nThen, if d_ab is 4 and d_bc is 3: major.\n\nIf d_ab is 3 and d_bc is 4: minor.\n\nIf neither is true for any permutation, then it's strange.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- For each of the 6 possible permutations of the three notes:\n\n   - Compute d_ab and d_bc.\n\n   - Check if d_ab is 4 and d_bc is 3: if so, it's a major.\n\n   - Else, check if d_ab is 3 and d_bc is 4: minor.\n\n   - If any permutation meets either condition, return accordingly.\n\n- After checking all permutations, if none meet the conditions, return 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says that the answer will always be unambiguous. So no cases where both major and minor are possible.\n\nSo now, the task is to implement this.\n\nSo the first thing is to create a mapping from note names to their positions.\n\nHow to do that? Maybe create a dictionary.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the notes are listed as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the index in the list would be 0 to 11.\n\nSo the dictionary can be built as follows:\n\nnote_to_pos = {'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11}\n\nWait, but wait—what about capitalization? The problem says the input is given as space-separated notes, like 'C E G' etc. So the note names are case-sensitive. So the keys should match exactly, which they do.\n\nSo now, for each note in the input, we can get their positions.\n\nOnce we have the three positions, say a, b, c, we can generate all permutations of [a, b, c], which are 6 in total.\n\nFor each permutation (x, y, z):\n\nd_xy = (y - x + 12) % 12\n\nd_yz = (z - y + 12) % 12\n\nif d_xy ==4 and d_yz ==3: major.\n\nelif d_xy ==3 and d_yz ==4: minor.\n\nElse, continue.\n\nIf any permutation meets the condition, we output accordingly.\n\nOtherwise, 'strange'.\n\nSo the plan is solid.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nWe'll read the input as a single line, split into 3 strings.\n\nEach string is a note, e.g., 'C', 'E', 'G' etc.\n\nWe'll map each to their position using the note_to_pos dict.\n\nThen, collect the three positions as a list, say, notes = [pos1, pos2, pos3]\n\nThen, import itertools.permutations to generate all possible orderings.\n\nFor each perm in permutations(notes):\n\n   x, y, z = perm\n\n   compute d_xy = (y -x +12) %12\n\n   compute d_yz = (z -y +12) %12\n\n   if d_xy ==4 and d_yz ==3: return 'major'\n\n   elif d_xy ==3 and d_yz ==4: return 'minor'\n\nAfter checking all perms, if none found, return 'strange'.\n\nYes, that's the plan.\n\nNow, test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nSample Output: ['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nLet's process each case.\n\nFirst case: 'C E G'\n\nNotes: C (0), E (4), G (7)\n\nPermutations include:\n\n(0,4,7): \n\nd_xy = (4-0) =4 →4 mod12=4.\n\nd_yz =7-4=3 →3 mod12=3.\n\nSo 4 and 3: major. So the first case is major.\n\nSecond case: 'C# B F'\n\nNotes: C# is 1, B is10, F is5.\n\nSo positions are [1,10,5].\n\nGenerate all permutations.\n\nOne permutation is (1,10,5):\n\nd_xy =10-1=9 mod12=9.\n\nNot 4 or 3.\n\nAnother permutation: (10,5,1).\n\nWait, let's compute for permutation (B, F, C#):\n\nWait, permutation (10,5,1):\n\nd_xy =5-10 = -5 → add 12 →7 mod12=7.\n\nNope.\n\nWait, another permutation: (5,1,10).\n\nd_xy =1-5 = -4 →8 mod12=8.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, perhaps permutation (B, C#, F):\n\nWhich is (10,1,5):\n\nd_xy=1-10= -9 →3 mod12=3.\n\nd_yz=5-1=4.\n\nSo d_xy=3, d_yz=4: minor.\n\nSo the second case is minor.\n\nThird case: 'A B H' → positions 9,10,11.\n\nCheck all permutations.\n\nLike (9,10,11):\n\nd_xy=1, d_yz=1: no.\n\nAnother permutation: (10,9,11):\n\nd_xy= (9-10)=-1 →11 mod12=11. No.\n\nWait, permutation (9,11,10):\n\nd_xy=11-9=2 →2 mod12=2.\n\nd_yz=10-11= -1 →11 mod12=11. No.\n\nAnother permutation: (11,9,10):\n\nd_xy= (9-11) =-2 →10 mod12=10. No.\n\nHmm, perhaps another permutation: (11,10,9):\n\nd_xy=10-11 =-1 →11 mod12=11. No.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, what about permutation (9,10,11):\n\nd_xy=1, d_yz=1: not matching.\n\nWhat about (10,11,9):\n\nd_xy=11-10=1 →1.\n\nd_yz=9-11= -2 →10 mod12=10. Not 4.\n\nHmm. What about (11,9,10):\n\nd_xy=9-11 =-2 →10 mod12=10.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, is there any permutation where d_xy is 4 and d_yz is 3, or vice versa?\n\nWait, let's compute all possible permutations:\n\nThere are 6 permutations for 3 elements.\n\n1. 9,10,11 → d1=1, d2=1 → no.\n\n2. 9,11,10 → d1= (11-9)=2, d2=(10-11)= -1 →11 mod12=11. No.\n\n3.10,9,11 → d1= (9-10)=-1 →11 mod12=11. No.\n\n4.10,11,9 →d1=1, d2=(9-11)=-2 →10 mod12=10. No.\n\n5.11,9,10 →d1=(9-11)=-2 →10 mod12=10. No.\n\n6.11,10,9 →d1= (10-11)=-1 →11 mod12=11. No.\n\nSo none of the permutations satisfy the major or minor conditions. So the third case is 'strange'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nFirst, create the note_to_pos dictionary.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_pos = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nRead the input: input().split() → gives a list of 3 strings.\n\nThen, for each string, get their positions.\n\npositions = [note_to_pos[n] for n in input().split()]\n\nThen, generate all permutations of positions.\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nfor perm in permutations(positions):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d_xy = (y - x + 12) % 12\n    d_yz = (z - y + 12) % 12\n    if d_xy ==4 and d_yz ==3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d_xy ==3 and d_yz ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nAfter checking all perms, print 'strange'.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_pos = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = input().strip().split()\npositions = [note_to_pos[note] for note in input_notes]\n\nfound = False\nfor perm in permutations(positions):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d_xy = (y - x + 12) % 12\n    d_yz = (z - y + 12) % 12\n    if d_xy ==4 and d_yz ==3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        found = True\n        break\n    elif d_xy ==3 and d_yz ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        found = True\n        break\n\nif not found:\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n\nWait, but what about the order in which the permutations are checked? Since once a condition is met, the code breaks and exits. So it's efficient.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input:\n\nInput: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nProcessing each input:\n\nFirst input: C E G → positions [0,4,7]. The permutation (0,4,7) gives d_xy=4, d_yz=3 → major.\n\nSecond input: C# B F → positions [1,10,5]. One permutation is (10,1,5): d_xy= (1-10) mod12 → (1-10) is -9, +12=3 →3, d_yz= (5-1)=4 →3 and 4 →minor.\n\nThird input: A B H → positions [9,10,11]. As discussed, no permutation satisfies, so 'strange'.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: what about a minor triad?\n\nE.g., C, D#, G → but wait, let's see.\n\nWait, C is 0, D# is 3, G is 7.\n\nIn permutation (C, D#, G): d_xy=3, d_yz=4 → minor.\n\nSo code should output 'minor'.\n\nAnother test case: C, E, G is major.\n\nAnother test case: C, D, F is strange.\n\nWait, C is 0, D is 2, F is5.\n\nCheck all permutations.\n\n(0,2,5): d_xy=2, d_yz=3 → no.\n\n(0,5,2): d_xy=5-0=5 →5, d_yz=2-5=-3→9. No.\n\n(2,0,5): d_xy= (0-2) →10 mod12=10. No.\n\n(2,5,0): d_xy=3 →3, d_yz= (0-5)→7 mod12=7. No.\n\n(5,0,2): d_xy= (0-5) →7 mod12=7. No.\n\n(5,2,0): d_xy= (2-5) →-3→9 mod12=9. No.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the conditions. So code outputs 'strange'.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given triad of musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The triad consists of exactly three notes, and the classification is based on the distances between consecutive notes in some permutation of the triad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Representation**: Each note is represented by its position in a cyclic sequence of 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated as the number of semitones from the lower note to the higher note, considering the cyclic nature of the sequence. This is done using modulo arithmetic.\n3. **Permutations Check**: For each permutation of the three notes, we check if the distances between consecutive notes match the criteria for a major or minor chord:\n   - **Major Chord**: The distance between the first and second notes is 4 semitones, and between the second and third is 3 semitones.\n   - **Minor Chord**: The distance between the first and second notes is 3 semitones, and between the second and third is 4 semitones.\n4. **Efficiency**: By generating all permutations of the three notes and checking each one, we ensure that we correctly identify the type of chord if it exists.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_pos = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = input().strip().split()\npositions = [note_to_pos[note] for note in input_notes]\n\nfound = False\nfor perm in permutations(positions):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d_xy = (y - x + 12) % 12\n    d_yz = (z - y + 12) % 12\n    if d_xy == 4 and d_yz == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        found = True\n        break\n    elif d_xy == 3 and d_yz == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        found = True\n        break\n\nif not found:\n    print(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line of three space-separated notes.\n2. **Note Conversion**: Each note is converted into its corresponding numerical position using a predefined dictionary.\n3. **Permutations Generation**: Using the `permutations` function from the `itertools` module, we generate all possible orderings of the three notes.\n4. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, we calculate the distances between consecutive notes.\n5. **Chord Classification**: Based on the calculated distances, we determine if the triad forms a major, minor, or neither, and print the result accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible configurations of the triad to accurately classify it.",
