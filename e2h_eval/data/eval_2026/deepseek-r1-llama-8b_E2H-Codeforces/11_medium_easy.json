A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain resources: drink, lime slices, and salt. I need to calculate the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given the available resources.\n\nLet's break down the input variables:\n\n- n: number of friends\n- k: number of bottles of drink\n- l: milliliters per bottle\n- c: number of limes cut into slices\n- d: slices per lime, so total slices are c * d\n- p: grams of salt\n- nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast per friend\n- np: grams of salt needed per toast per friend\n\nEach toast for all friends requires each person to have their own set. So, for one toast, each friend needs nl ml, one slice, and np grams.\n\nSo, let's think about the total resources required for a certain number of toasts, say t.\n\n1. Drink: For each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So total drink required is n * t * nl. We have k * l ml available. So the maximum t allowed by drink is (k * l) // (n * nl).\n\n2. Lime slices: Each toast uses one slice per friend. So for t toasts, each friend uses t slices. So total slices needed is n * t. The total available is c * d. So max t from limes is (c * d) // n.\n\n3. Salt: Each toast per friend needs np grams. So for t toasts, each needs t * np grams. Total salt is p grams. So max t from salt is p // (t * np). Wait, no. Wait, each toast requires np per friend. So for t toasts, each friend uses t * np? Or wait, per toast, each friend needs np, so for t toasts, each needs t * np? No, that's not right. Wait, no: per toast, each friend uses np. So for t toasts, each friend uses t * np. So total salt needed is n * t * np. So the maximum t allowed by salt is p // (n * np).\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, per toast, each friend needs np grams. So for each toast, the group uses n * np grams. So for t toasts, it's t * n * np. So the maximum t based on salt is p divided by (n * np), using integer division.\n\nSo now, the overall maximum t is the minimum of the three values: drink, limes, salt.\n\nBut wait, how do we compute each?\n\nCompute:\n\nmax_toasts_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nmax_toasts_lime = (c * d) // n\nmax_toasts_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nThen the maximum possible t is the minimum of these three.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me make sure.\n\nFor example, in the sample input 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5: total drink is 20 ml.\n\nEach toast per friend needs 3 ml. So per toast, total drink needed is 3 * 3 =9 ml.\n\nWait, wait: nl is 3, so each friend per toast needs 3ml. So per toast, for all friends, it's 3 *3 =9ml.\n\nTotal drink is 4*5=20ml. 20 /9 is 2 full toasts (since 2*9=18 <=20, 3*9=27>20). So max_toasts_drink is 2.\n\nLimes: c=10, d=8 → total slices 80. Each toast, each friend needs 1 slice. So per toast, 3 slices used. 80/3 is 26, but since 26*3=78 which is less than 80, but 27*3=81>80. So 26? Wait wait, no: 80 divided by 3 is 26.666, but integer division gives 26. But wait, the sample says limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, the sample says the limes can make 80 toasts. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's re-calculate.\n\nIn the first sample:\n\nc=10, d=8. So total slices is 80.\n\nEach toast requires each friend to have a slice. So per toast, 3 slices are used. So for t toasts, 3t slices are needed. So the maximum t is 80 /3 = 26.666, but integer division would be 26.\n\nBut the sample explanation says limes are enough for 80 toasts. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check.\n\nThe problem says each friend needs a slice for each toast. So for t toasts, each friend has t slices. So total slices needed is n * t.\n\nSo the maximum t is (c*d) // n.\n\nIn the sample, c*d=10*8=80, n=3. So 80//3=26.\n\nBut the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, why? Because 80 toasts would require 80 *3=240 slices? That doesn't add up.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me read the note again.\n\nSample input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nThey have 10 limes, each cut into 8 slices → 80 slices.\n\nEach toast needs a slice per friend, so for 80 toasts, each friend makes 80 slices, but wait that's not possible. Wait, no, each friend makes one slice per toast. So for 80 toasts, each friend needs 80 slices, but that would require 3 *80=240 slices. But they only have 80. So that can't be.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the limes are enough for 80 toasts in the sense that each lime can be used once, but each toast requires one slice per person. So if you have 80 slices, each toast requires 3 slices (for 3 friends). So the maximum number of toasts is 80 //3 =26.\n\nBut the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps each toast requires 1 slice per friend, but the same slice cannot be reused. So for each toast, each friend uses a new slice. So for t toasts, you need n*t slices.\n\nSo the maximum t is floor((c*d)/n).\n\nIn the sample, 80/(3) is 26.666, so 26.\n\nBut sample explanation says the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the sample explanation.\n\nLooking back at the note:\n\n\"However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, so in the note, the limes are 80 toasts. How does that happen?\n\nWait, perhaps the way the slices are used is different. Oh, perhaps each lime provides multiple slices, but each lime can't be split into more than one slice per toast.\n\nWait, perhaps each lime can be used for multiple toasts as long as the slices are enough. Like, each lime can contribute slices over multiple toasts.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because each lime is cut into d slices. So each lime contributes d slices. So the total slices is c*d.\n\nEach toast requires n slices (one per friend).\n\nSo the maximum number of toasts from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nSo for the sample, 80//3=26.\n\nBut sample note says limes are enough for 80 toasts. That suggests that (c*d) is 80, and n is 3. So 80 /3 is 26.666, but 26 toasts.\n\nHmm, this is conflicting. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample explanation is wrong? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps each lime is used per toast. Like, per toast, each friend needs a lime slice. So each toast requires n slices, but each slice comes from a different lime. So for 80 toasts, each toast uses 3 slices, but each slice is from a different lime. So total limes used is 80 *3 =240, but they only have 10 limes, which isn't possible.\n\nNo, that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each lime can be used for multiple toasts. Like, each lime's slices are used across multiple toasts. So each lime can contribute some slices, but once a slice is used, it's gone.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense either because each slice is used once per toast.\n\nI think my initial approach is correct. So in the sample, limes allow 26 toasts.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, it says the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So why is that?\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Wait, perhaps the maximum number of toasts based on limes is (c * d) // (n * t), but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum toasts based on limes is (c * d) // (n * t). No, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the limes' contribution is (c * d) // (n * t). Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of each lime providing d slices. So each lime can be used for t toasts, but each toast requires one slice per friend. So each toast requires n slices, each from a different lime.\n\nWait, but then for each toast, you can use any of the limes, but each slice is used once.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model it is that for each toast, you need n slices, each from a different lime. So the number of limes needed per toast is n. So for t toasts, you need n * t limes.\n\nBut that can't be because the total limes is c, which is 10.\n\nSo for t toasts, n * t <= c. So t <= c /n.\n\nIn the sample, c is 10, n is 3. So t is 3 (3*3=9 <=10). Then, after that, you have 1 lime left. But that's only one toast.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with the sample explanation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each lime can be used for multiple toasts, but each time, you take a slice from it.\n\nSo each lime can contribute up to d slices, each used in a different toast.\n\nWait, but each toast requires n slices, each from a different lime. So for each toast, you need n slices, each from a different lime.\n\nWait, perhaps each lime can be used for multiple toasts, but each time, you take one slice.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because each toast requires n slices, each from a different lime. So each toast consumes n limes, one slice each.\n\nSo for t toasts, you need n * t limes. Since each lime can be used for one slice.\n\nSo the maximum t is floor(c / n). Because for each toast, you need one lime per friend.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. So if you have c limes, each toast uses n limes (each friend gets a slice from a different lime). So for t toasts, you need n*t limes. So the maximum t is c // n.\n\nWait, but in the sample, c is 10, n is 3. 10//3 is 3, so t is 3.\n\nBut the sample says limes are enough for 80 toasts. That can't be.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck here.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nEach toast requires each friend to have a slice. So for each toast, you need n slices. Each slice comes from a lime, but each lime can provide multiple slices.\n\nBut each lime is cut into d slices. So each lime can contribute up to d slices, each used in different toasts.\n\nSo for each toast, you can use any of the slices from any lime, but each slice is used once.\n\nSo the total number of slices is c*d.\n\nEach toast uses n slices.\n\nSo the maximum number of toasts from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nSo in the sample, c*d=10*8=80, n=3. So 80//3=26. So the limes can support 26 toasts.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking back at the sample note:\n\nOverall, the friends have 4*5=20ml of drink, enough for 20/3=6 toasts.\n\nThe limes are enough for 10*8=80 toasts, which would mean 80 /3=26.666, but that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the sample. Let me read the note again.\n\nThe note says:\n\n\"However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2.\"\n\nAh! So the limes are sufficient for 80 toasts, but each friend can make 80 toasts.\n\nWait, that can't be because each toast requires a slice per friend. So for 80 toasts, each friend would need 80 slices, which would require 3 *80=240 slices, but they only have 80.\n\nSo perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps each lime is used for one toast, regardless of the number of friends.\n\nNo, that can't be because the problem says each friend needs a slice per toast.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each lime is used for one toast, but each toast can have multiple limes, but each lime is used only once.\n\nWait, perhaps the limes are sufficient for 80 toasts because each toast can use multiple limes, but each lime can only be used once.\n\nWait, but that would imply that for each toast, you need as many limes as the number of friends, which is 3.\n\nSo for 80 toasts, you need 80 *3 =240 limes, but they only have 10. So that's not possible.\n\nHmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm considering the limes to be consumed per toast, but perhaps it's that each lime can contribute to multiple toasts, as long as the slices are available.\n\nSo for each toast, each friend uses one slice. So each lime can contribute to multiple toasts as long as it has enough slices.\n\nBut the total slices is 80, so each toast uses 3 slices. So 80 /3 is 26.666, so 26 toasts.\n\nBut the sample note says limes are enough for 80 toasts. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the number of toasts each friend can make is t, but the limes must be able to supply n slices per toast.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that for each toast, each friend uses a slice, but those slices can come from the same lime, but each lime can only be used once.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense because a lime can't be used for multiple toasts; each slice is used once.\n\nI think I'm stuck on this point. Perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach and see if it aligns with the sample.\n\nIn the sample, the drink allows 20ml, each toast for all friends uses 3 *3=9ml. So 20//9 is 2. So drink allows 2 toasts.\n\nLimes: 80 slices, 3 per toast → 26 toasts.\n\nSalt: 100 grams, each toast for all friends uses 3 *1=3 grams. So 100//3 is 33.\n\nSo the minimum is 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nBut the sample note says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. So perhaps I'm miscalculating something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that each toast requires one slice per friend, but each slice can come from any lime. So the total number of slices needed is t * n. So the maximum t is (c*d) // n.\n\nWhich is 80//3=26.\n\nBut sample note says limes are enough for 80 toasts. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the sample note is wrong? Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that each toast requires a single slice, not per friend. But that's not what the problem says.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo each friend needs a slice per toast. So for each toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. So for t toasts, each friend makes t slices, so total slices needed is n * t.\n\nTherefore, the maximum t allowed by limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nSo in the sample, that's 80//3=26.\n\nBut the sample note says limes are enough for 80 toasts. So perhaps the sample note is wrong, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the limes are enough for 80 toasts because each lime can be used for one toast, but each toast can use multiple limes.\n\nWait, that can't be. Because each friend needs a slice, which must come from a lime. So for each toast, you need n limes, each providing one slice. So for each toast, you consume n limes.\n\nThus, the number of limes required for t toasts is n * t.\n\nSince you have c limes, the maximum t is c //n.\n\nWait, in the sample, c is 10, n is 3. So 10//3=3. So 3 toasts.\n\nBut that would mean that the limes would allow 3 toasts, but the sample note says 80.\n\nThis is really confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the limes are sufficient for t toasts, where t is such that c*d >= n * t.\n\nSo in the sample, 80 >=3*t → t=26 (since 3*26=78 ≤80, 3*27=81>80).\n\nSo that gives t=26.\n\nSo that makes sense.\n\nSo the sample note is correct. So in the sample, the limes are enough for 26 toasts.\n\nWait, but the sample note says 80.\n\nSo perhaps the sample note is wrong. Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, the sample note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts, but the calculation says 26. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that each lime can be used for multiple toasts, but each lime can only be used once. So each lime can contribute to one toast.\n\nWait, that can't be because that would require n limes per toast, but the total limes may not be sufficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\n\n\"cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.\"\n\n\"A toast... each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo each friend needs a slice per toast. So for t toasts, each friend needs t slices.\n\nThus, the total slices needed is n * t.\n\nThe total slices available is c * d.\n\nSo the maximum t allowed by limes is (c*d) //n.\n\nThus, in the sample, 80//3=26.\n\nBut the sample note says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. So perhaps the sample note is wrong. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that each lime can be used for multiple toasts, but each time, only one slice is taken.\n\nSo for each lime, you can get d slices, each used in separate toasts.\n\nSo for t toasts, the number of limes needed is ceil(t *n /d).\n\nBut that's more complex.\n\nBut I think that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that each lime can be used for one toast, but each toast requires one slice per friend, so for each toast, you need n limes. So for t toasts, you need n*t limes. So the maximum t is c //n.\n\nIn the sample, c=10, n=3 → t=3.\n\nSo in that case, limes allow 3 toasts.\n\nBut the sample note says that limes are enough for 80 toasts.\n\nSo I'm getting stuck.\n\nPerhaps I should proceed with the initial approach, and see what the code will compute.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the maximum toasts allowed by drink: (k*l) / (n * nl) → integer division.\n2. Compute maximum toasts allowed by limes: (c*d) // n.\n3. Compute maximum toasts allowed by salt: p // (n * np).\n4. The overall maximum is the minimum of these three.\n5. Output that number.\n\nTesting this against the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nDrink: (4*5) =20. Divided by (3*3)=9 → 2.222 → 2.\nLimes: (10*8)=80. Divided by 3 →26.\nSalt: 100 / (3 *1) =33.333 →33.\nMinimum is 2.\n\nSample output is 2, which matches.\n\nAnother sample input: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → drink: 1000ml. Each toast per friend needs 4ml →5 *4=20 per toast. 1000/20=50.\n\nLimes: c=1, d=19 →19 slices. 19 /5=3 (since 5*3=15<=19, 5*4=20>19). So limes allow 3 toasts.\n\nSalt: p=90. Each toast per friend needs 3g →5 *3=15g per toast. 90 /15=6.\n\nMinimum of 50,3,6 →3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nThird sample input: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1.\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → drink: 1000*1000=1e6 ml. Each toast per friend needs 50ml →10*50=500 per toast. 1e6 /500=2000.\n\nLimes: 25*23=575 slices. 575 /10=57.5 →57.\n\nSalt: 1 gram. Each toast per friend needs 1g →10*1=10 per toast. 1//10=0.\n\nSo the minimum is 0.\n\nWhich matches the third sample output.\n\nSo my initial approach works for the samples.\n\nThus, I think the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nWe'll read the input as a list of integers.\n\nCompute the three values:\n\ndrink_toasts = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlime_toasts = (c * d) // n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nPrint result as a string.\n\nSo, the code in Python would look like this:\n\nRead the input line, split into integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ncompute drink_toasts = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlime_toasts = (c * d) // n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nprint(result)\n\nYes, that's the code.\n\nTesting against the samples.\n\nFirst sample: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → outputs 2.\n\nSecond sample: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3 → outputs 3.\n\nThird sample: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1 → outputs 0.\n\nAll correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Resources**: Each toast requires:\n   - `nl` milliliters of drink per friend.\n   - 1 lime slice per friend.\n   - `np` grams of salt per friend.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**:\n   - **Drink**: The total amount of drink available is `k * l`. Each toast for all friends uses `n * nl` milliliters. Thus, the maximum number of toasts possible from the drink is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n   - **Limes**: Each lime is cut into `d` slices, giving a total of `c * d` slices. Each toast requires `n` slices, so the maximum number of toasts possible from limes is `(c * d) // n`.\n   - **Salt**: The total amount of salt available is `p`. Each toast for all friends uses `n * np` grams. Thus, the maximum number of toasts possible from salt is `p // (n * np)`.\n\n3. **Determine the Limiting Resource**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the smallest value among the three calculated values from drink, limes, and salt.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlime = (c * d) // n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\n\nprint(min(drink, lime, salt))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input values are read and parsed into respective variables.\n- **Calculations**:\n  - `drink`: The maximum number of toasts based on the available drink.\n  - `lime`: The maximum number of toasts based on the available lime slices.\n  - `salt`: The maximum number of toasts based on the available salt.\n- **Result**: The minimum value among `drink`, `lime`, and `salt` is the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, as it is constrained by the available resources.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using integer division to handle the constraints and ensures that each friend can make the same number of toasts.",
