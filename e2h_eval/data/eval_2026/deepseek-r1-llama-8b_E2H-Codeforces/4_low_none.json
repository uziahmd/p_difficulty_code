The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this Rock-Paper-Scissors problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that Nikephoros and Polycarpus are playing n rounds of rock-paper-scissors. In each round, they choose their move from their respective sequences A and B, cycling through them. If one wins, the loser gets a red spot. We need to count how many red spots each has after n rounds.\n\nHmm, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the input gives n, then two strings A and B. Each character in these strings represents their choice for each round, cycling as needed.\n\nSo, for each round i (from 0 to n-1), we need to determine who wins and who loses.\n\nWait, but since both have cycles, for each round i, their choices are A[i % m] and B[i % k], right? Because each sequence is repeated cyclically.\n\nFor each round, compare their choices:\n\n- If both same: draw, no red spots.\n- Else, determine the winner. The winner is the one whose choice beats the other.\n   - For example, Rock (R) beats Scissors (S), Scissors beat Paper, Paper beats Rock.\n   - So, if A's choice beats B's, then B gets a spot.\n   - Else, A gets a spot.\n\nSo, for each of the n rounds, we'll compute whether A's move beats B's or not. Then, tally the number of times each gets a spot.\n\nNow, the constraints: n can be up to 2e5 (200,000). A and B can be up to 1000 characters each. So, for each round, we just need to find A's current move and B's current move, compare them, and update counters.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2e5, which is manageable because even a loop of 2e5 steps is acceptable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read n, A, B.\n2. Initialize counters for each player: a = 0, b = 0.\n3. For each round from 0 to n-1:\n   a. Get current move for A: a_move = A[i % len(A)]\n   b. Similarly for B: b_move = B[i % len(B)]\n   c. Compare a_move and b_move.\n   d. If a_move beats b_move: increment b by 1.\n   e. Else if b_move beats a_move: increment a by 1.\n   f. Else: do nothing.\n4. After all rounds, output a and b.\n\nNow, the key part is determining when one move beats the other.\n\nLet me think about the winning conditions:\n\n- Rock (R) beats Scissors (S)\n- Scissors (S) beats Paper (P)\n- Paper (P) beats Rock (R)\n\nSo, for any pair of moves, x and y:\n\nx beats y if:\n(x is R and y is S) OR\n(x is S and y is P) OR\n(x is P and y is R)\n\nIf none of those, then check if y beats x. Or, if x == y, then no one gets a spot.\n\nSo, in code terms:\n\nfor each round i:\n    a_char = A[i % m]\n    b_char = B[i % k]\n    if a_char == b_char:\n        continue\n    else:\n        if (a_char, b_char) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            # a wins, b gets a spot\n            b += 1\n        else:\n            # b wins, a gets a spot\n            a += 1\n\nWait, wait. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, in the problem statement, if a's move beats b's, then b loses and gets a spot. So, for example, in the first sample:\n\nIn the second round, A plays 'P' and B plays 'S'. Since P beats S, so A's move wins. So, B gets a spot.\n\nYes, because when A's move beats B's, B is the loser.\n\nSo, the logic is correct.\n\nSo, now, the code structure.\n\nIn Python:\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nThen, m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nInitialize a and b as 0.\n\nLoop for i in range(n):\n    a_move = A[i % m]\n    b_move = B[i % k]\n    if a_move == b_move:\n        continue\n    # check if a_move beats b_move\n    if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or \\\n       (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or \\\n       (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n        b += ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on each player after they have played a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors. Each round is played according to a cyclic sequence of moves chosen by each player.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of rounds and the sequences of moves for both players.\n2. **Initialization**: Initialize counters to keep track of the number of red spots for each player.\n3. **Cyclic Move Selection**: For each round, select the move for each player based on their respective cyclic sequences.\n4. **Determine Winner**: Compare the moves of both players in each round to determine the winner. The winner's move beats the loser's move according to the rules of rock-paper-scissors.\n5. **Update Counters**: Increment the counter for the loser (the player who did not win) each time a round is played.\n6. **Output Results**: After all rounds are played, print the number of red spots for each player.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\na = 0\nb = 0\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a_move = A[i % m]\n    b_move = B[i % k]\n    if a_move == b_move:\n        continue\n    if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or \\\n       (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or \\\n       (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n        b += 1\n    else:\n        a += 1\n\nprint(a, b)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Reading**: The code reads the number of rounds `n` and the sequences `A` and `B`.\n- **Initialization**: Two counters, `a` and `b`, are initialized to zero to keep track of the red spots for each player.\n- **Loop Through Rounds**: For each round, the move for each player is determined using modulo arithmetic to cycle through their respective sequences.\n- **Winning Condition Check**: The code checks if the current move of one player beats the other's move. If so, the counter for the losing player is incremented.\n- **Output**: After processing all rounds, the counters are printed, giving the number of red spots for each player.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles up to the maximum constraint of 200,000 rounds by leveraging the cyclic nature of the sequences and only checking the necessary conditions for each round.",
