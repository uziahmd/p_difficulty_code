    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. First, I need to understand what happens when we remove each element. For each element, I can compute what the new max and min would be in the remaining array, then calculate the instability and find the minimum among all these possibilities.\n\nBut wait, considering that n can be up to 1e5, iterating through each element and for each, checking the max and min of the remaining elements would be too slow. Because for each element, finding the max and min could take O(n) time, leading to O(n^2), which is definitely not feasible for n=1e5.\n\nSo I need a smarter way to compute this without having to recompute max and min for every possible removal.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the initial max and min of the entire array. When I remove an element, the new max could either stay the same or decrease if I removed the current max. Similarly, the new min could stay the same or increase if I removed the current min.\n\nWait, but that's only true if the element I'm removing is either the max or the min. What if I remove an element that's neither? Then the max and min remain the same as the original array's max and min, right?\n\nWait no. If the array has multiple max elements, like if there are multiple 7s in the first example, then removing one 7 doesn't change the max. So, perhaps the key is to consider whether the element being removed is the max, the min, or neither.\n\nSo, here's an idea:\n\n1. Find the global max and global min of the array.\n2. Also, count how many times the max occurs (count_max) and how many times the min occurs (count_min).\n3. Then, for each possible element, when we remove it, we can see if it affects the max or min:\n   - If the element is the current max and count_max > 1: then the new max remains the same, since there are other max elements.\n   - If the element is the current max and count_max == 1: then the new max is the second highest element.\n   - Similarly for min: if the element is the current min and count_min > 1, the new min remains; else, it's the next min.\n4. So, for each element a_i, the new max and min after removing it can be computed based on whether a_i is the current max, current min, or neither.\n\nWait, but how do I quickly find the second max and second min? Because for elements that are max or min, their removal might require knowing the next in line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal instability after removing an element is determined by whether that element is the max or min, or neither.\n\nLet me think: the instability is (max - min). So, when we remove an element, the new instability is either:\n\n- If the element was the max and it's the only max, then the new max is the next highest. The new min is the same as before unless the removed element was also the min, which it's not in this case. So the new instability would be (new_max - old_min).\n\n- If the element was the min and it's the only min, then the new min is the next lowest, so the new instability is (old_max - new_min).\n\n- If the element is neither the max nor the min, then the max and min remain the same as the original array's, so the instability is (original_max - original_min).\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Suppose the array is [1, 3, 3, 7]. If I remove 3, which is neither the max nor the min. Then the max is still 7, the min is still 1. So the instability is 6, which is same as before.\n\nYes. So, for any element that is neither max nor min, removing it doesn't change the max or min. Therefore, the instability remains the same as the original array's instability.\n\nSo, the minimal instability after removal must come from either:\n\n- Removing a max element, which may cause the new max to be lower, thus possibly reducing the instability.\n\n- Removing a min element, which may cause the new min to be higher, thus possibly reducing the instability.\n\n- Or, perhaps, not. Because sometimes, the new instability could be higher than the original. Wait, no. Because when you remove an element that's not a max or min, the instability remains the same as original. So, the minimal instability cannot be worse than the original, but it can be equal or better.\n\nWait, but in some cases, removing a non-max/non-min element might not change the instability. So the minimal possible instability is at least the original max - min.\n\nSo, to find the minimal possible instability, I should consider:\n\n- The original instability (in case we can't improve it by removing any element).\n\n- The possible instabilities when we remove a max element.\n\n- The possible instabilities when we remove a min element.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the original max and min, and their difference (original_diff = max - min).\n\n2. Find all occurrences of the max and min in the array.\n\n3. For each occurrence of the max, if there are more than one max, then removing it won't change the max. So the new instability would be (max - min) same as original. But wait, no. Because if the max is removed, and there are other maxes, then the max remains. So the new instability is same as before.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the array is [1, 3, 3, 7]. The max is 7, appearing once. So, removing 7 will change the max to 3. The new instability is 3-1=2, which is less than the original 6.\n\nIf the array has multiple maxes, like [1,3,7,7], then removing one 7 leaves another 7, so the max doesn't change. So, the instability remains same.\n\nSo, when you remove a max, the new max is:\n\nif count_max > 1: max remains same.\n\nelse: new_max is the second_max.\n\nSimilarly for min.\n\nSo, for each element in the array, when I remove it, I can determine whether the new max and min change.\n\nBut considering that n is large, I can't process each element naively.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nCompute the original max, min, and their counts.\n\nCompute the second_max and second_min.\n\nThen, for each element a_i:\n\nif a_i is the current max:\n\n   if count_max > 1:\n\n      new_max = current_max\n\n   else:\n\n      new_max = second_max\n\nelse if a_i is the current min:\n\n   if count_min > 1:\n\n      new_min = current_min\n\n   else:\n\n      new_min = second_min\n\nelse:\n\n   new_max = current_max\n\n   new_min = current_min\n\nThen, the new instability is (new_max - new_min).\n\nWe can compute this for each a_i and track the minimal value.\n\nWait, but how do I get second_max and second_min?\n\nI can precompute them.\n\nSo, steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Find the original max, original min, count_max, count_min.\n\n2. Find the second_max: the maximum value less than the original max.\n\n   How? Iterate through the array and find the maximum value that is less than max_val.\n\n3. Similarly, find the second_min: the minimum value greater than the original min.\n\n4. Now, for each element a_i:\n\n   a. If a_i == max_val:\n\n      i. if count_max > 1:\n\n          new_max = max_val\n\n      ii. else:\n\n          new_max = second_max\n\n      new_min remains original_min.\n\n      So, new_instability = new_max - original_min.\n\n   b. Else if a_i == min_val:\n\n      i. if count_min > 1:\n\n          new_min = min_val\n\n      ii. else:\n\n          new_min = second_min\n\n      new_max remains original_max.\n\n      new_instability = original_max - new_min.\n\n   c. Else:\n\n      new_max = original_max\n\n      new_min = original_min\n\n      new_instability = original_diff.\n\n5. Find the minimal new_instability across all a_i.\n\n6. Compare this minimal with the original_diff and choose the smaller one.\n\nWait, but why compare with the original_diff? Because when you remove a non-max and non-min element, the new instability is same as original. So, the minimal could be the original_diff, but it's already considered when processing other elements.\n\nWait, because in step 4c, the new_instability is the original_diff. So, when processing all a_i, the minimal will be the minimum between all the new_instabilites, which includes the original_diff for non-max/min elements.\n\nSo, the overall minimal is the minimal of all new_instabilites, including those from step 4a, 4b, and 4c.\n\nWait, but for non-max/min elements, the new_instability is same as original. So, in that case, the new_instability for those elements is original_diff. So, when you process them, the new_instability is original_diff, which is the same as the original.\n\nSo, when you collect all the possible new_instabilties, the minimal will be the smallest among:\n\n- All the new_instabilties from removing max elements.\n\n- All the new_instabilties from removing min elements.\n\n- And the original_diff (from removing non-max/min elements).\n\nSo, the minimal will be the minimum of all these options.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the original max, min, count_max, count_min.\n\n- Precompute the second_max and second_min.\n\n- For each a_i:\n\n   Compute the new_max and new_min as per the rules above.\n\n   Compute the new_instability as (new_max - new_min).\n\n   Keep track of the minimal new_instability.\n\n- The answer is the minimal new_instability found.\n\nBut wait, how do I efficiently compute the second_max and second_min?\n\nWell, for second_max, I can iterate through the array and find the maximum value that is less than the original max.\n\nSimilarly for second_min.\n\nFor example:\n\nTo find second_max:\n\nInitialize second_max as -infinity.\n\nIterate through each element:\n\n   if element < max_val and element > second_max:\n\n       second_max = element\n\nSimilarly for second_min.\n\nBut wait, what if all elements are same as max_val? Like [5,5,5]. Then, the second_max would be 5, but count_max is 3. So, when we remove one 5, the new_max is still 5, so the new_instability remains 0.\n\nWait, but in this case, the original max is 5, count_max is 3.\n\nSo, when you remove a 5, since count_max is 3 >1, the new_max is still 5. So, the new instability is 0.\n\nWhich is same as original.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nAnother test case: the sample input.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nn=4, a = [1,3,3,7]\n\nOriginal max is 7, count_max=1.\n\nSecond_max is 3.\n\nOriginal min is 1, count_min=1.\n\nSecond_min is 3.\n\nWhen you remove 7:\n\nnew_max is 3, new_min is 1 → instability 2.\n\nWhen you remove 1:\n\nnew_min is 3, new_max is 7 → instability 4.\n\nWhen you remove 3 (non max/min):\n\nnew_max is 7, new_min is 1 → instability 6.\n\nSo, the minimal is 2.\n\nIn the second sample:\n\nn=2, a = [1, 100000].\n\nOriginal max is 100000, count_max=1.\n\nSecond_max is 1.\n\nOriginal min is 1, count_min=1.\n\nSecond_min is 100000.\n\nWhen you remove 1:\n\nnew_min is 100000, but since it's the only element, wait no, n becomes 1. Wait, wait n is 2 initially. Removing one element leaves 1, so the array has only one element, and thus both max and min are same. So instability is 0.\n\nSimilarly, removing 100000, the remaining is 1, instability is 0.\n\nSo, the minimal is 0.\n\nSo, according to the approach, for each element:\n\nFor the first sample:\n\nProcessing each element:\n\n1: it's the min. count_min=1, so new_min becomes second_min (3). So new instability is 7-3=4.\n\n3: neither max nor min. So new instability is 7-1=6.\n\n3: same as above.\n\n7: it's max, count_max=1. So new_max is second_max (3). New instability is 3-1=2.\n\nThus, the minimal is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, the task is to implement this.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the array a.\n\nCompute original_max = max(a)\n\nCompute original_min = min(a)\n\ncount_max = number of times original_max appears in a.\n\ncount_min = number of times original_min appears in a.\n\nCompute second_max: the maximum value in a that is less than original_max.\n\nCompute second_min: the minimum value in a that is greater than original_min.\n\nIf all elements are same as original_max, then second_max is same as original_max.\n\nSimilarly for min.\n\nOnce I have these values, I can proceed.\n\nThen, for each element in a:\n\nif the element is original_max:\n\n   if count_max > 1:\n\n       new_max = original_max\n\n   else:\n\n       new_max = second_max\n\n   new_min = original_min\n\nelse if the element is original_min:\n\n   if count_min > 1:\n\n       new_min = original_min\n\n   else:\n\n       new_min = second_min\n\n   new_max = original_max\n\nelse:\n\n   new_max = original_max\n\n   new_min = original_min\n\nCompute current_instability = new_max - new_min.\n\nKeep track of the minimal current_instability.\n\nFinally, output the minimal current_instability.\n\nBut wait, what if the array has only two elements? Like the second sample.\n\nIn that case, when you remove one, the array has one element, so the instability is zero.\n\nWhich is correctly handled by the approach.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute second_max and second_min correctly.\n\nHow to compute second_max:\n\nInitialize second_max to -infinity.\n\nIterate through each element:\n\n   if element < original_max and element > second_max:\n\n       second_max = element\n\nBut what if all elements are equal to original_max? Then, second_max remains -infinity, which is wrong.\n\nWait, but in that case, when you remove a max element, since count_max is more than 1, the new_max remains original_max.\n\nSo, in that case, for the second_max, it's not needed because when count_max is >1, the new_max is same as original_max.\n\nSo, even if second_max is not found, it's okay because the condition is count_max >1.\n\nSo, perhaps, in the case where all elements are same as original_max, the second_max can be set to original_max.\n\nSimilarly for second_min.\n\nSo, perhaps during the computation of second_max, if none of the elements is less than original_max, then second_max = original_max.\n\nWait, but in that case, the array is all max elements.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nCompute second_max as the maximum value in a that is less than original_max.\n\nIf no such value exists, set second_max to original_max.\n\nWait, but that can't happen because, if all elements are equal to original_max, then any element removed is a max. And if count_max is more than 1, the new_max remains original_max.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the second_max isn't used because the count_max is more than 1.\n\nSo, in code, it's safe to proceed.\n\nSo, to compute second_max:\n\nsecond_max = -infinity\n\nfor num in a:\n\n   if num < original_max:\n\n       if num > second_max:\n\n           second_max = num\n\nif second_max is still -infinity, meaning all elements are equal to original_max, then set second_max = original_max.\n\nSimilarly for second_min:\n\nsecond_min = +infinity\n\nfor num in a:\n\n   if num > original_min:\n\n       if num < second_min:\n\n           second_min = num\n\nif second_min is still infinity, meaning all elements are equal to original_min, then set second_min = original_min.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nCompute second_max:\n\nsecond_max = -infinity\n\nfor num in a:\n\n   if num < original_max:\n\n       if num > second_max:\n\n           second_max = num\n\nif second_max == -infinity:\n\n   second_max = original_max\n\nSame for second_min.\n\nWait, but in the case where the array is [1,3,3,7], the second_max would be 3.\n\nIn the case where the array is [7,7,7], the second_max is 7.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, now, let's outline the code.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead a as list of integers.\n\noriginal_max = max(a)\n\noriginal_min = min(a)\n\ncount_max = a.count(original_max)\n\ncount_min = a.count(original_min)\n\nCompute second_max:\n\nsecond_max = -inf\n\nfor num in a:\n\n   if num < original_max:\n\n       if num > second_max:\n\n           second_max = num\n\nif second_max == -inf:\n\n   second_max = original_max\n\nSimilarly for second_min:\n\nsecond_min = inf\n\nfor num in a:\n\n   if num > original_min:\n\n       if num < second_min:\n\n           second_min = num\n\nif second_min == inf:\n\n   second_min = original_min\n\nNow, for each num in a:\n\nif num == original_max:\n\n   if count_max > 1:\n\n       new_max = original_max\n\n   else:\n\n       new_max = second_max\n\n   new_min = original_min\n\nelif num == original_min:\n\n   if count_min > 1:\n\n       new_min = original_min\n\n   else:\n\n       new_min = second_min\n\n   new_max = original_max\n\nelse:\n\n   new_max = original_max\n\n   new_min = original_min\n\ncurrent_instability = new_max - new_min\n\nkeep track of the minimal current_instability.\n\nNow, the code can be written.\n\nBut wait, in Python, for n up to 1e5, this should be manageable.\n\nLet's test the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=4, a = [1,3,3,7]\n\noriginal_max =7, count_max=1.\n\nsecond_max is 3.\n\noriginal_min=1, count_min=1.\n\nsecond_min=3.\n\nProcessing each element:\n\n1: it's min.\n\ncount_min is 1, so new_min = second_min=3.\n\nnew_max=7.\n\ncurrent_instability=4.\n\n3: neither max nor min.\n\nnew_max=7, new_min=1 → 6.\n\n3: same as above.\n\n7: it's max, count_max=1.\n\nso new_max=second_max=3.\n\nnew_min=1.\n\ncurrent_instability=2.\n\nSo, the minimal is 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, a=[1,100000]\n\noriginal_max=1e5, count_max=1.\n\nsecond_max=1.\n\noriginal_min=1, count_min=1.\n\nsecond_min=1e5.\n\nProcessing each element:\n\n1: it's min, count_min=1 → new_min=1e5.\n\nnew_max=1e5.\n\ncurrent_instability=0.\n\n1e5: it's max, count_max=1 → new_max=second_max=1.\n\nnew_min=1.\n\ncurrent_instability=0.\n\nThus, minimal is 0.\n\nSo, code works.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nTest case where all elements are same.\n\nn=3, a = [5,5,5]\n\noriginal_max=5, count_max=3.\n\nsecond_max=5.\n\noriginal_min=5, count_min=3.\n\nsecond_min=5.\n\nProcessing each element:\n\neach element is 5.\n\nFor each, since it's max and count_max>1, new_max=5.\n\nnew_min=5.\n\ncurrent_instability=0.\n\nThus, the minimal is 0.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=5, a=[2,1,3,2,4]\n\noriginal_max=4, count_max=1.\n\nsecond_max=3.\n\noriginal_min=1, count_min=1.\n\nsecond_min=2.\n\nProcessing each element:\n\nCheck each element:\n\n2: neither max nor min.\n\nnew_max=4, new_min=1 → 3.\n\n1: it's min, count_min=1 → new_min=2.\n\nnew_max=4 → 4-2=2.\n\n3: neither.\n\nnew_max=4, new_min=1 → 3.\n\n2: same as first.\n\n4: it's max, count_max=1 → new_max=3.\n\nnew_min=1 → 2.\n\nSo, the minimal is 2.\n\nThus, code should output 2.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about when the array has multiple max and min, but removing one affects the new instability.\n\nE.g., array is [3,3,5,5]. Original max is5, count_max=2.\n\noriginal min is3, count_min=2.\n\nsecond_max is3.\n\nsecond_min is5.\n\nProcessing each element:\n\nFor each 3:\n\nit's min, count_min=2>1 → new_min remains 3.\n\nnew_max is5.\n\nso new instability is 2.\n\nFor each 5:\n\ncount_max=2>1 → new_max remains 5.\n\nnew_min is3.\n\nso new instability is 2.\n\nThus, all elements when removed, the instability remains 2.\n\nSo, the minimal is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case:\n\narray is [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1].\n\noriginal max is10, count_max=1.\n\nsecond_max is9.\n\noriginal min is1, count_min=1.\n\nsecond_min is2.\n\nProcessing each element:\n\nremoving 10: new_max=9, new_min=1 → 8.\n\nremoving 9: new_max=8, new_min=1 →7.\n\nremoving 8: new_max=7, new_min=1 →6.\n\netc.\n\nBut what about when you remove 1: new_min becomes 2.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Key Values**: First, we find the global maximum and minimum values of the array, along with their counts. This helps us understand the impact of removing elements that are either the maximum or minimum.\n2. **Compute Second Max and Min**: We also compute the second highest maximum value (second_max) and the second lowest minimum value (second_min). These values are crucial when the element being removed is the only maximum or minimum.\n3. **Evaluate Impact of Removing Each Element**: For each element in the array, we determine what the new maximum and minimum values would be if that element were removed. Based on whether the element is the current maximum, minimum, or neither, we adjust the new maximum and minimum accordingly.\n4. **Calculate Instability**: For each scenario, we compute the instability of the resulting array and keep track of the minimum instability encountered.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\noriginal_max = max(a)\noriginal_min = min(a)\ncount_max = a.count(original_max)\ncount_min = a.count(original_min)\n\n# Compute second_max\nsecond_max = -float('inf')\nfor num in a:\n    if num < original_max:\n        if num > second_max:\n            second_max = num\nif second_max == -float('inf'):\n    second_max = original_max\n\n# Compute second_min\nsecond_min = float('inf')\nfor num in a:\n    if num > original_min:\n        if num < second_min:\n            second_min = num\nif second_min == float('inf'):\n    second_min = original_min\n\nmin_instability = float('inf')\n\nfor num in a:\n    if num == original_max:\n        if count_max > 1:\n            new_max = original_max\n        else:\n            new_max = second_max\n        new_min = original_min\n    elif num == original_min:\n        if count_min > 1:\n            new_min = original_min\n        else:\n            new_min = second_min\n        new_max = original_max\n    else:\n        new_max = original_max\n        new_min = original_min\n    current = new_max - new_min\n    if current < min_instability:\n        min_instability = current\n\nprint(min_instability)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the input values, including the size of the array and the array elements.\n2. **Finding Global Max and Min**: It calculates the maximum and minimum values of the array and their respective counts.\n3. **Computing Second Max and Min**: It iterates through the array to find the second highest maximum and the second lowest minimum values.\n4. **Evaluating Each Element Removal**: For each element, it checks if the element is the maximum, minimum, or neither. Depending on this, it adjusts the new maximum and minimum values after removal.\n5. **Calculating Instability**: For each scenario, it computes the instability and keeps track of the minimum instability found.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum possible instability without having to recompute the entire array's max and min for each possible removal, making the solution both optimal and efficient.",
