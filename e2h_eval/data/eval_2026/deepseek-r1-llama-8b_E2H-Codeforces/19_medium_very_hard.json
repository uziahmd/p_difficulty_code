The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about selecting which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for each remaining district is maximized. The president wants to remove k districts, and we need to choose which ones to remove.\n\nHmm. So the structure is a tree because there are n-1 edges and exactly one path between any two nodes. Our goal is to select a subset of nodes such that they form a connected subgraph, and the sum of 2^i is as large as possible. We need to remove exactly k nodes.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the problem says that after removing k contestants, the remaining districts must be able to reach each other. So the remaining districts must form a connected subgraph. But since the original graph is a tree, the remaining graph will also be a forest, but for it to be connected, it must be a single tree.\n\nSo, the task is to find a connected subtree (a tree) with as many high-value nodes as possible, where the value of a node i is 2^i. We need to maximize the sum of these values, and then choose to remove the k nodes not in this subtree.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the president removes k contestants, so the remaining ones are the ones we keep. So the remaining nodes must form a connected subtree, and the sum of their 2^i must be as large as possible.\n\nBut wait, the way the problem is phrased, the president can choose which districts to remove. So he wants to remove k districts, and the remaining should form a connected component. So the optimal strategy is to select a connected induced subgraph of size (n - k) that has the maximum possible sum of 2^i.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nI think the approach is to find the subtree that includes the highest possible nodes, because 2^i grows exponentially. So including higher-numbered nodes is better because their contribution is much larger.\n\nBut wait, in a tree, the higher-numbered nodes might form a chain. For example, if the tree is a straight line from 1 to n, then the best subtree would include the last m nodes, where m = n -k. Because each node beyond that point adds a lot more than the earlier ones.\n\nWait, let me think. Suppose the tree is a straight line: 1-2-3-4-...-n. Then, the best connected subgraph is a consecutive segment of nodes. For example, if we have to leave m =n -k nodes, the optimal is to pick the last m nodes, because 2^n is way bigger than 2^(n-1), etc. So the sum would be 2^{n} + ... + 2^{n - m +1}.\n\nBut wait, what if the tree is a star? Like, node 1 is connected to all others. Then, the optimal subtree would include node 1 plus as many other nodes as needed. But since 2^1 is only 2, it's better to include node n, n-1, etc., even if that means excluding node 1.\n\nWait, no. If node 1 is included, it connects all the other nodes. So including node 1 allows us to include as many other nodes as possible. So perhaps the optimal solution is to include the node with the highest possible value, and all nodes along the path from that node to some root.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal connected subgraph is a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible, connected via their paths.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the approach is to find a subtree that includes the top (n -k) nodes in terms of their 2^i values, arranged in such a way that they form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how to model this? It's tricky because the structure of the tree can vary.\n\nAnother angle: The sum of 2^i is maximized when the largest possible exponents are included. So the optimal connected subgraph should consist of the largest possible set of nodes, starting from the highest-numbered nodes.\n\nSo the idea is to select the (n -k) largest-numbered nodes in such a way that they form a connected subtree.\n\nWait, but in a general tree, the largest nodes may not form a connected subtree. For example, if the tree is a chain, like 1-2-3-4-5, and n=5, k=1. Then the largest node is 5, but to include it, you need to include 4, 3, 2, 1. So the subtree would be all except one of them.\n\nBut if the tree is a star, like node 1 connected to 2,3,4,5. Then, the largest nodes are 5,4,3,2,1. But including 5 requires that you connect it to node 1. So the subtree would include node 1 and 5. But if we have to include more nodes, say 5,4,3,2, then we need to include node 1, and all of them. Or wait, no—each of those nodes is directly connected to node 1, so including them all gives a connected subtree.\n\nSo the key is to find the largest possible set of nodes, preferably the highest-numbered, arranged in a way that they form a connected subtree.\n\nTherefore, the optimal solution is to find a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible, and those nodes are connected in the tree.\n\nBut how do we determine which nodes to include? Maybe we can model this by considering the nodes in decreasing order of their number and trying to build a subtree that includes as many as possible, ensuring connectivity.\n\nAn alternative approach is to find the minimal number of nodes to remove so that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree. But since we're required to remove exactly k nodes, perhaps the optimal is to include the nodes with the highest 2^i values, connected in a way that forms a subtree.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal solution is to find a subtree consisting of the last m nodes in some path, where m = n -k. But how?\n\nWait, another thought: the sum of 2^i is maximized when the included nodes are as large as possible. So the best possible scenario is to include the top (n -k) nodes. But whether they form a connected subtree depends on their arrangement in the tree.\n\nSo, the first step is to sort all the nodes in decreasing order of their number. Then, starting from the top, we try to include them into a connected subtree.\n\nBut how do we ensure that they form a connected subtree? Because each node must be connected to at least one other node in the set.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is similar to finding a subtree where the nodes form a path, and the path is as long as possible. Because in a tree, any subtree that is a path is connected.\n\nWait, but in a general tree, any subtree is a tree. So perhaps the best approach is to find a subtree that includes the largest possible number of high-numbered nodes, forming a path.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Sort all nodes in decreasing order of their number.\n2. Start with the first node in this sorted list.\n3. Try to include as many subsequent nodes as possible, provided that they are connected in the tree and form a connected subtree.\n4. Once we have selected m = n -k nodes, we stop.\n\nBut how to efficiently check if adding a node to the current set keeps the subtree connected.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as building a subtree incrementally. At each step, include the next highest node, and see if it can be connected to the current subtree.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to perform a greedy selection of the nodes in the order of their value (from highest to lowest). We can represent the current subtree as a set of nodes, and for each new node, check if it is adjacent to any node already in the set. If yes, include it; if not, skip it. But this may not be sufficient because sometimes including a lower node could allow including more higher nodes.\n\nNo, that approach might not work because, for example, including a lower node might split the current subtree, making it impossible to include higher nodes that are disconnected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal connected subtree is a maximal path in the tree, containing as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nWait, but how to find such a path.\n\nAnother idea: The problem is equivalent to finding a subtree of size m = n -k, which is connected, and whose sum of 2^i is maximum. Since 2^i increases with i, the subtree should include as many high i's as possible.\n\nSo the optimal subtree is the one that contains the largest possible number of high i's, connected in a way that they form a connected subtree.\n\nIn a tree, any subtree is connected as long as the nodes form a connected subgraph. So the problem reduces to selecting a connected subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Find the largest possible connected subtree that includes as many of the highest-numbered nodes as possible, with the total size being m = n -k.\n\nHow do we find such a subtree?\n\nOne approach is to find the minimal number of nodes to remove from the tree to include the top (n-k) nodes. But that seems vague.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is a path that starts at some node and goes as far as possible, including the highest possible nodes.\n\nBut in a tree, the maximum path is the diameter, but that may not necessarily include the highest nodes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is formed by taking a path that includes as many of the highest-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nWait, another angle: the subtree must include a certain set of nodes, and the sum is the sum of their 2^i. So the sum is maximized when the included nodes are as large as possible.\n\nThus, the optimal connected subtree is the one that includes the m largest nodes possible in a connected way.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Sort all nodes in decreasing order of their number.\n2. Starting from the top, select nodes until we have m nodes, ensuring that they form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how to do this? Because the nodes may not be connected initially.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to find a set of m nodes that are in a connected subtree, and among all possible such sets, the one with the highest possible sum.\n\nBut how to find this quickly.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that includes the node with the highest value, and as many nodes as possible connected to it, in the order of their value.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a priority queue where we greedily add nodes adjacent to the current subtree, starting from the highest node.\n\nWait, here's an algorithm idea:\n\n- Start with the highest-numbered node (say, node u).\n- Add it to the subtree.\n- Then, add all its neighbors that are higher than any node in the subtree, but this doesn't make sense because u is the highest.\n- Alternatively, for each node in the subtree, look for neighbors that are higher than any in the subtree, and add them.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nWe want to build a subtree S, initially empty. We process the nodes in order from highest to lowest. For each node v in this order, we check if it can be added to S while keeping S connected. If yes, add it to S. Continue until S has size m.\n\nBut how to check if adding v will keep S connected.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled as finding the minimal set of nodes to remove so that the remaining form a connected subtree of size m. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that forms a path, and the path includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Find the longest possible path in the tree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n2. If the length of this path is >= m, then select the last m nodes of this path.\n3. Else, adjust accordingly.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea comes to mind. The sum of 2^i is maximized when the included nodes are as large as possible. So, perhaps the optimal connected subtree is the one that includes the last m nodes in some path, where m = n -k.\n\nWait, let's take the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n6 3\nEdges:\n2-1\n2-6\n4-2\n5-6\n2-3\n\nSo the tree looks like:\n\n1 is connected to 2. 2 is connected to 3, 4, 6. 6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo the nodes are 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nWhen k=3, we need to remove 3 nodes, leaving 3. The output is to remove 1,3,4. So the remaining nodes are 2,5,6.\n\nWait, 2,5,6. How are they connected? 2 is connected to 6, and 6 is connected to 5. So yes, it's a connected subtree.\n\nBut 5 and 6 are higher than 2, so why not include 5,6, and 3,4,2, etc.?\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes 6,5, and as many nodes as possible, but perhaps not including lower nodes like 2.\n\nWait, in the sample, the sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 +32+64=100.\n\nIf instead, they had included 2,3,4,5,6, that's 5 nodes, but in the sample n=6, k=3, m=3. So that wouldn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the optimal subtree is the path 2-6-5. That's three nodes, sum is 4+32+64=100.\n\nAlternatively, including 3,2,6,5 would give four nodes, but in the sample m=3.\n\nSo the optimal is to include the highest three nodes.\n\nBut in the sample, the chosen subtree is 2,5,6. Which is a path of three nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal is to include the last m nodes in the tree's longest path that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to find the path in the tree that has the maximum number of high-numbered nodes, and then select the last m nodes of this path.\n\nBut how to find such a path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is a chain where the nodes are as large as possible, and the sum is maximized.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Sort all nodes in decreasing order of their number.\n2. Starting from the highest, try to include as many as possible in a connected subtree.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother thought: Each node has a value of 2^i. The sum is maximized when the included nodes are the highest possible. So the optimal connected subtree will include the m highest nodes possible, as long as they are connected.\n\nBut in a tree, the m highest nodes may not be connected. So, the problem reduces to finding the largest possible connected subgraph that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that consists of all nodes in a path from some node u to node v, where u and v are the two ends of the path, and the path includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think about the sample again. The nodes sorted in decreasing order are 6,5,2,3,4,1. The optimal subtree includes 6,5, and 2. Why not include 3 or 4?\n\nBecause including 2, 3,4 would require including 2, which is lower than 5 and 6. So the sum would be 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + ... which is less than 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6.\n\nSo it's better to exclude the lower nodes and include higher ones.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to find a subtree that is a path, and includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nThus, the algorithm could be:\n\n- Find all possible paths in the tree and select the one that includes the most high-numbered nodes, up to m.\n\nBut this is computationally infeasible for n up to 1e6.\n\nAlternative approach: For each node, compute the size of the subtree rooted at that node, and select the one that can include the most high nodes.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes the highest node, and as many nodes as possible in its subtree that are higher than others.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Since the sum is 2^i, each node's contribution is exponentially increasing with i. So including a higher i is always better than including a lower i, regardless of how many nodes are included.\n\nSo, the optimal solution is to include the m highest-numbered nodes, provided they form a connected subtree.\n\nIf they do, that's the solution. If not, we need to find the largest connected subset of the m highest nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the largest connected subset of the top m nodes.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Sort all nodes in decreasing order of their number.\n2. Take the first m nodes. Now, check if they form a connected subtree.\n   a. If yes, include them. Otherwise, find the largest connected subset within them.\n3. Remove the nodes not in this subset.\n\nBut how to find the largest connected subset.\n\nWait, but the first m nodes may not be connected. So, perhaps we need to find a connected subset of them that has as large a sum as possible.\n\nThis sounds like the problem of finding a connected induced subgraph with maximum sum, which is known as the maximum induced tree problem, but I'm not sure of the exact approach.\n\nWait, but in our case, the nodes are in a tree, so the induced subgraph is a forest, but we need it to be a single tree.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's imagine that we want to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible in a connected subtree. So, the subtree should include the highest node, and then as many as possible in its neighborhood that are also high.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this as a BFS starting from the highest node, adding nodes in decreasing order of their number, provided that they are adjacent to the current subtree.\n\nHere's how it could work:\n\n- Start with the highest node (node x).\n- Mark it as part of the subtree.\n- Look at all its neighbors. Among these, find the next highest node that is not yet marked. Add it to the subtree.\n- Repeat this process, always choosing the next available neighbor that is the highest possible and not yet in the subtree.\n\nThis way, we greedily build a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible, ensuring that each step adds a node that is connected to the existing subtree.\n\nLet me test this logic against the sample.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nNodes in sorted order: 6,5,2,3,4,1.\n\nm = 6 -3 =3.\n\nStart with 6. Subtree has {6}. Added to result.\n\nCheck its neighbors: 2 and 5.\n\nBetween them, 5 is higher than 2. So add 5 to the subtree.\n\nNow, subtree is {6,5}.\n\nCheck neighbors of 5: only 6, which is already in the subtree.\n\nNow, the subtree has size 2, but we need 3. So we need to find the next highest node not in the subtree.\n\nNext in the sorted list is 2. Check if 2 is adjacent to any node in the subtree.\n\n6 is connected to 2. So add 2 to the subtree.\n\nNow, subtree is {6,5,2}.\n\nSize is 3, which is m. So we can't add more nodes.\n\nSo the removed nodes are 1,3,4. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: suppose the tree is a straight line 1-2-3-4-5, and n=5, k=0. So m=5. We have to include all nodes, which is the entire tree.\n\nAnother example: n=4, k=1. So m=3. The tree is 1-2-3-4.\n\nThe optimal subtree is 2-3-4, sum is 4+8+16=28. Alternatively, 1-2-3-4 would include 4, but 1 is lower than 2, so including 2,3,4 is better.\n\nWait, but according to the algorithm above:\n\nsorted nodes:4,3,2,1.\n\nstart with 4. Add to subtree.\n\nneighbors are 3.\n\nadd 3.\n\nnow, neighbors of 3: 2. So add 2.\n\nsubtree now is 4,3,2. Size 3, which is m=3.\n\nSo the removed node is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: tree is a star, center node 1, connected to 2,3,4,5,6.\n\nn=6, k=2. So m=4.\n\nsorted nodes:6,5,4,3,2,1.\n\nstart with 6. Its only neighbor is 1.\n\nAdd 1. Then, from 1, look for next highest node not in subtree:5, then 4, then 3, then 2.\n\nBut each time, adding the next highest node.\n\nSo subtree becomes 6,1,5,4,3,2. But that's 6 nodes, but m=4. So the subtree would be 6,1,5,4, which is 4 nodes.\n\nWait, but the sum is 64 + 2 + 16 + 8 = 90.\n\nAlternatively, is there a better way? Like, including 6,5,4,3.\n\nBut 3 is not connected to 6, unless through 1.\n\nSo the subtree would have 6,5,4,3, but that's 4 nodes. Sum is 64+32+16+8=120, which is better than the previous.\n\nWait, but according to the algorithm I proposed earlier, the subtree would include 6, then 1, then 5, then 4, which gives a sum of 64+2+32+16=114, which is less than 120.\n\nSo the algorithm isn't capturing the optimal solution in this case.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the initial approach is flawed.\n\nWhat's the issue here?\n\nIn this star example, the optimal subtree is to include 6,5,4,3. They form a connected subtree via 1. So the sum is 64 +32+16+8 = 120.\n\nBut according to the algorithm:\n\nStart with 6. Add 1. Then add 5. Then add 4. Then add 3. So the subtree is {6,1,5,4,3,2}, which is 6 nodes, but we only need 4. So the sum is 64 + 2 +32 +16=114.\n\nBut the optimal is to include 6,5,4,3, which sum to 120.\n\nSo the initial approach is not working.\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nAh, because in the initial approach, when adding 1, we have to include it, which is lower than 5,4,3, but by doing so, we can include all the leaves.\n\nBut the sum is higher if we don't include 1 and 2, but include 5,4,3,6.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, in the star example, node 1 is connected to all others. So including node 6,5,4,3 requires that all are connected through node 1. So, the subtree includes 6,5,4,3,1.\n\nWait, but that's 5 nodes, but m is 4.\n\nWait, no. In the problem statement, m is n-k=6-2=4.\n\nWait, so including 4 nodes.\n\nWait, in this case, the subtree would have to include 6,5,4,3, but how? Because each is connected via 1.\n\nBut if the subtree is 6,5,4,3, then they are not connected directly. So to form a connected subtree, they must all be connected through 1.\n\nSo the subtree would be 6,1,5,4,3. That's 5 nodes. But m is 4. So we have to remove one node.\n\nWhich node to remove to maximize the sum.\n\nWait, perhaps removing 1 would allow us to include 6,5,4,3, but each is connected through 1. Without 1, they are not connected.\n\nSo, to have a connected subtree, we must include 1.\n\nSo the subtree can't be just 6,5,4,3; it must include 1 as well.\n\nSo the sum is 64 + 2 +32 +16 = 114.\n\nBut in this case, that's the best we can do.\n\nBut wait, another possibility: include 6,5,4, and 2. But 2 is connected to 1, which is not in the subtree. So 2 is not connected to 6,5,4.\n\nSo the subtree would be 6,5,4,2, but 2 is not connected to 5,4,6. So that's not connected.\n\nSo that's not allowed.\n\nSo the initial approach gives the correct sum.\n\nSo perhaps the algorithm is correct.\n\nWait, but in the star example, the algorithm adds 6, then 1, then 5, then 4. So the subtree is {6,1,5,4}.\n\nSum is 64+2+32+16=114.\n\nIs that the maximum possible?\n\nYes, because any other selection of 4 nodes would include 1, and at least some of the leaves, but not all.\n\nFor example, including 6,5,3,4 would require 1, but sum is 64+32+8+16=120, same as before.\n\nWait, wait, 64+32 is 96, plus 16 is 112, plus 8 is 120. Oh right, same sum.\n\nSo the sum is same regardless of which two of the leaves we include.\n\nSo in this case, the algorithm's approach gives the same sum as the optimal.\n\nBut wait, what if m is larger than the number of nodes in the initial approach? No, because m is fixed.\n\nSo perhaps the algorithm is correct.\n\nBut why in the sample, the algorithm correctly selects 6,5,2.\n\nWait, in the sample, node 2 is connected to 6. So when the algorithm adds 6, and then 2, the sum is 64+4=68, but wait, 2 is 2^2=4, 5 is 32, so including 6,5,2 gives 64+32+4=100.\n\nWait, but the sample's sum is 100, which is correct.\n\nSo perhaps the algorithm works.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nSort all nodes in decreasing order.\n\nStart with the highest node.\n\nThen, for each step, among the unselected nodes adjacent to the current subtree, pick the highest one and add it to the subtree.\n\nRepeat until the subtree has size m.\n\nThe nodes not in the subtree are the ones to be removed.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently for n up to 1e6.\n\nImplementation Steps:\n\n1. Read the tree and build an adjacency list.\n\n2. Sort all nodes in decreasing order of their number.\n\n3. Initialize a visited array to track which nodes are in the subtree.\n\n4. Use a priority queue (or a deque) to manage the nodes to consider adding next. Initially, the queue contains the highest node.\n\n5. While the size of the subtree is less than m:\n\n   a. Extract the next node to consider from the priority queue. This node is adjacent to the current subtree.\n\n   b. If this node hasn't been visited yet:\n\n      i. Add it to the subtree.\n\n      ii. Mark it as visited.\n\n      iii. Add all its adjacent nodes to the priority queue, but only if they haven't been visited yet.\n\n6. The nodes in the subtree are the ones to keep. The rest are to be removed.\n\nWait, but in the priority queue, we need to process the nodes in the order of their value. So, for each node, we can track the highest available node in its adjacency list that hasn't been processed yet.\n\nAlternatively, for each node in the subtree, we can keep track of the highest available neighbor.\n\nBut for n=1e6, we need an efficient way to process this.\n\nAn alternative approach is to represent the priority queue as a heap, where each element is a node, and the heap is ordered based on the node's number in descending order.\n\nEach time we extract the highest node, we check if it's adjacent to any node in the subtree. If it is, and if it hasn't been added yet, we add it to the subtree and process its neighbors.\n\nWait, but in a tree, each node has multiple neighbors, so this could get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, during the processing, for each node in the subtree, we can look at all its adjacent nodes and find the highest one that's not yet in the subtree.\n\nWait, but that would require for each node in the subtree, checking all its neighbors and seeing which are the highest.\n\nThis could be O(n) per node, which is too slow for n=1e6.\n\nSo, perhaps a better approach is to pre-sort each node's adjacency list in descending order of node numbers.\n\nThen, for each node in the subtree, when it's added, we can go through its adjacency list in order, and for each neighbor, if it's not in the subtree, we can add it to a priority queue.\n\nWait, but that's still a bit involved.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nWe can use a max-heap (priority queue) where each element is a node's value and the current highest candidate to be added.\n\nWe start by adding the highest node to the heap.\n\nWe maintain a visited set to track which nodes are in the subtree.\n\nAs we process each node from the heap, for each of its adjacent nodes, if the adjacent node is not in the subtree and has not been added to the heap yet, we add it to the heap.\n\nBut this approach could cause the heap to have multiple copies of the same node. So, we need a way to ensure each node is processed only once.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Read the tree and build an adjacency list for each node, sorted in descending order of node numbers.\n\n2. Sort all nodes in descending order.\n\n3. Create a max-heap (using negative values in a min-heap) and push the highest node.\n\n4. Create a visited set and mark the highest node as visited.\n\n5. While the size of the subtree is less than m:\n\n   a. Pop the highest node from the heap.\n\n   b. For each neighbor in the adjacency list of this node, in order:\n\n      i. If the neighbor is not visited and is not already in the heap, push it to the heap and mark it as 'in heap' to avoid duplicates.\n\n   c. After processing all neighbors, if the neighbor is not visited, add it to the subtree and mark as visited.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the step is:\n\nAfter popping a node u from the heap, we iterate through its neighbors in descending order.\n\nFor each neighbor v:\n\n   if v is not visited:\n\n      add v to the heap.\n\n      mark v as 'in heap' to avoid adding it multiple times.\n\nContinue until the heap is empty or the subtree reaches size m.\n\nBut this approach may not capture all necessary nodes, as the heap could have lower nodes added before higher ones.\n\nWait, perhaps this is the way to model the process.\n\nLet me try to outline the algorithm:\n\n- All nodes are initially unprocessed.\n\n- The heap is a priority queue (max-heap) that orders nodes by their number in descending order.\n\n- The visited set is empty.\n\n- Push the highest node into the heap.\n\n- While the size of the subtree is less than m:\n\n   - Pop the node u from the heap.\n\n   - If u is already visited, continue.\n\n   - Mark u as visited.\n\n   - Add u to the subtree.\n\n   - For each neighbor v of u, in descending order of their number:\n\n      - If v is not visited and not already in the heap, push it into the heap.\n\nSo, this way, when we process u, we look at its neighbors in the order of their numbers (highest first). For each neighbor, if it's not already processed or queued, we add it to the heap.\n\nThis ensures that higher-numbered nodes are processed first, and their neighbors are considered before lower ones.\n\nTesting this on the star example:\n\nn=6, k=2, m=4.\n\nHighest node is 6. Pushed into heap.\n\nPop 6. Marked as visited. Subtree size is 1.\n\nCheck its neighbors: 1. Push 1 into the heap.\n\nHeap now has 1.\n\nNext iteration: Pop 1.\n\nMarked as visited. Subtree size 2.\n\nCheck its neighbors: 2,3,4,5,6.\n\n6 is already visited. Push 5, then 4, then 3, then 2.\n\nHeap now has 5,4,3,2.\n\nNext iteration: Pop 5. Marked as visited. Subtree size 3.\n\nCheck its neighbors: 6 (visited). No more pushes.\n\nHeap now has 4,3,2.\n\nNext iteration: Pop 4. Marked as visited. Subtree size 4. Stop.\n\nSo the subtree includes 6,1,5,4. Sum is 64+2+32+16=114.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: the sample.\n\nn=6, k=3, m=3.\n\nPush 6 into heap.\n\nPop 6. Marked as visited. Subtree size 1.\n\nNeighbors: 2 and 1. Push 2, then 1.\n\nHeap now has 2,1.\n\nPop 2. Marked as visited. Subtree size 2.\n\nNeighbors: 1,3,4,6.\n\n6 is visited. Push 3,4,1.\n\nBut 1 is in the heap but not visited.\n\nSo heap now has 3,4,1.\n\nPop 3. Marked as visited. Subtree size 3. Stop.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the subtree is 6,5,2.\n\nWait, this suggests that the algorithm is incorrect.\n\nHmm, what's wrong here.\n\nIn the sample, the subtree should include 6,5,2.\n\nBut according to the algorithm, it's including 6,2,3.\n\nWhich is wrong.\n\nSo the algorithm is not working as expected.\n\nWait, perhaps the way the adjacency lists are sorted is incorrect.\n\nIn the sample, node 6 is connected to 2 and 5.\n\nWait, the adjacency list for 6 would be [2,5], but in the code, we sorted the adjacency list in descending order.\n\nSo node 6's neighbors are 2 and 5. When sorted in descending order, 5 comes before 2.\n\nSo when processing 6, we first push 5, then 2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the adjacency list for 6 is built from the input edges. The edges are 2-6, 5-6.\n\nSo node 6's neighbors are 2 and 5. So when we sort them in descending order, 5 comes before 2.\n\nSo when processing 6, we push 5 first, then 2.\n\nSo the heap after processing 6 is [5,2].\n\nThen, pop 5. Mark as visited. Subtree size 2.\n\nCheck its neighbors: 6 (visited).\n\nSo nothing is pushed.\n\nHeap now has 2.\n\nPop 2. Mark as visited. Subtree size 3. Stop.\n\nSo the subtree is 6,5,2. Which is correct.\n\nSo why did I get a different result earlier?\n\nBecause in my initial analysis, I thought the adjacency list was sorted in ascending order.\n\nWait, no. The code should sort each node's adjacency list in descending order of the neighbor's node number.\n\nSo, in the sample, node 6's adjacency list is [5,2].\n\nSo when processing 6, we push 5 first, then 2.\n\nThen, when processing 5, it's popped, marked, and its neighbor 6 is visited. So nothing is done.\n\nThen, the heap has 2 left.\n\nProcessing 2: mark, add to subtree.\n\nSo the subtree is 6,5,2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm works for the sample.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that in the star example, the algorithm didn't work, but perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nSo, the algorithm seems to handle both cases correctly.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\n- For each node, sort its adjacency list in descending order of the neighbor's node number.\n\n- Use a max-heap (implemented as a priority queue using a min-heap with negative values) to process nodes in order of their node number, highest first.\n\n- For each node processed, mark it as visited, add it to the subtree, and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors, in the order of their node numbers (so that higher-numbered nodes are processed first).\n\n- Continue until the subtree reaches size m.\n\n- The nodes in the subtree are the ones to keep. The rest are to be removed.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this efficiently.\n\nImplementing the algorithm:\n\nFirst, we need to build the adjacency list, sort each node's adjacency list in descending order of the neighbor's node number.\n\nThen, create a max-heap, which can be implemented using a min-heap with negative values.\n\nWe also need a visited array to track which nodes are in the subtree.\n\nLet's think about the data structures:\n\n- n can be up to 1e6, so the adjacency list needs to be stored as a list of lists.\n\n- For each node, the adjacency list is sorted in descending order",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected subgraph, maximizing the total number of fans. The key insight is that higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more to the total number of fans, so we should prioritize including the highest-numbered districts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We need to find a connected subgraph that includes the maximum possible number of high-numbered districts. This ensures the sum of `2^i` values (where `i` is the district number) is maximized.\n2. **Greedy Strategy**: Use a greedy approach to build the connected subgraph by starting from the highest-numbered district and adding adjacent districts in descending order of their numbers.\n3. **Priority Queue**: Utilize a max-heap (implemented using a min-heap with negative values) to always process the highest-numbered unvisited district next.\n4. **Efficiency**: Each district is processed once, ensuring the algorithm runs efficiently even for large values of `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    k = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for _ in range(n-1):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        b = int(input[idx+1])\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n        idx += 2\n    \n    # Sort each adjacency list in descending order\n    for i in range(n+1):\n        edges[i].sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    m = n - k\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    heap = []\n    # Push the largest node into the heap\n    start_node = n\n    heapq.heappush(heap, -start_node)\n    visited[start_node] = True\n    subtree = [start_node]\n    \n    while len(subtree) < m:\n        current = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n        for neighbor in edges[current]:\n            if not visited[neighbor]:\n                heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n        # Now, process all neighbors in sorted order\n        for neighbor in edges[current]:\n            if not visited[neighbor]:\n                visited[neighbor] = True\n                subtree.append(neighbor)\n                if len(subtree) == m:\n                    break\n        if len(subtree) == m:\n            break\n    \n    # Collect the removed nodes\n    removed = []\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if i not in subtree:\n            removed.append(i)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, removed)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of districts `n`, the number of districts to remove `k`, and the edges of the tree.\n2. **Adjacency List Construction**: An adjacency list is built where each node points to its neighbors.\n3. **Sorting Neighbors**: Each node's adjacency list is sorted in descending order to ensure higher-numbered districts are considered first.\n4. **Max-Heap Initialization**: The highest-numbered district is added to the max-heap to start the greedy process.\n5. **Building the Subtree**: Using the max-heap, we repeatedly add the highest-numbered unvisited district to the subtree until we have included `m` districts, where `m = n - k`.\n6. **Collecting Removed Districts**: The districts not included in the subtree are those to be removed, which are printed in increasing order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the sum of `2^i` values by always including the highest possible districts in a connected subgraph.",
