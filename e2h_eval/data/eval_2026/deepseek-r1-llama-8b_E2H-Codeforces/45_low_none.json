There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tennis tournament. Let's break down the problem and think about how to approach it.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem statement again. The tournament is a knockout style, meaning that each loss eliminates a player immediately. The rule is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. So, for example, if a player has played 2 games, their next opponent can have played either 1 or 2 games as well.\n\nThe goal is to find the maximum number of games the winner can participate in. So, we need to model how the winner progresses through the rounds, ensuring that each time they play, the opponent meets the game count condition.\n\nHmm, thinking about this, it seems like we're looking for a sequence of games where each step adds a new possible opponent based on the previous game counts. The winner must win each game, so they can't lose, which implies that each subsequent opponent must have a game count that's either one less or equal to the current count.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's denote the number of games the winner has played as k. We need to find the largest possible k such that there are enough players to support this.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this recursively. For each step, the number of players required depends on the current game count. Let's see:\n\nFor the winner to have played k games, in each of these games, their opponents must have played either (k-1) or k games as well. But wait, no—because the opponents themselves can't have more than k games because the winner has to progress further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's similar to building a binary tree, but with constraints on the depth based on the allowed game differences.\n\nWait, another approach: think about the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games. Because, each game the winner plays reduces the number of possible opponents, considering the rules.\n\nLet me consider small examples to see a pattern.\n\nExample 1:\nn = 2. Only one game. So the maximum is 1.\n\nExample 2:\nn=3. The winner can play 2 games. How? They beat player 2, then player 3. Each time, their opponent has played 0 games before, so when the winner has played 1 game, the next opponent can have 0 or 1. So in the second game, the opponent has played 0, which is allowed.\n\nAnother way: the first match is between the winner and someone, say player 2. Then in the second round, the winner faces player 3. So two games.\n\nExample 3:\nn=4. According to the note, the answer is 2. Wait, why isn't it 3?\n\nBecause for the winner to play three games, each time the opponent should have either one less or same number of games. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the winner has 0 games, then plays against someone with 0 games. Then, after that, the winner has 1 game. The next opponent must have either 0 or 1. Suppose he plays someone who has 1 game. Now, the winner has 2 games. Next opponent needs to have either 1 or 2 games. But wait, for n=4, how many players are left after two games?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games.\n\nLet me think: To have k games, each opponent in each round must meet the condition of having at most one fewer or same number of games as the winner up to that point.\n\nSo, for each game the winner plays, the opponent must have either played the same number of games as the winner or one less.\n\nThis suggests that the number of opponents in each step depends on the current game count. Let's model this as a series of steps.\n\nLet's define f(k) as the minimal number of players needed for the winner to reach k games.\n\nWe can build f(k) recursively. For the first game (k=1), the winner has 0 games before, so the opponent must also have 0. So, the initial number of players is 2: the winner and one other.\n\nAfter the first game, the winner has played 1 game. Now, for the next game, the opponent must have played 0 or 1. But since the opponent is a new player, they haven't played any games yet. So, the next opponent must be a player that hasn't played any games. So, for the second game, we need at least one more player.\n\nSo, for k=2, the minimal number of players is 3.\n\nWait, but what about when n=4? Let's see:\n\nIf n=4, can the winner play",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given a specific rule about the number of games each player must have played before facing each other.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the winner's maximum number of games is constrained by the number of players and the rule that two players can only play if their number of games differs by at most one. We can model this using dynamic programming to find the minimal number of players required for the winner to play `k` games.\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: Define `f(k)` as the minimum number of players needed for the winner to play `k` games. We can build this recursively:\n   - For `k = 0`, no games are played, so `f(0) = 1`.\n   - For `k = 1`, the winner needs at least one opponent, so `f(1) = 2`.\n   - For each subsequent `k`, the number of players required depends on the previous step and the allowed game differences.\n\n2. **Recursive Formula**: The recursive formula for `f(k)` can be derived based on the constraints. For each game, the opponent must have either the same number of games or one less than the winner.\n\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: Using the above insights, we iteratively compute the minimal number of players required for each possible number of games up to the maximum feasible value.\n\n4. **Determine Maximum Games**: Find the largest `k` such that the computed `f(k)` is less than or equal to the given number of players `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nif n == 1:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    max_games = 0\n    min_players = [0] * (n + 1)\n    min_players[0] = 1\n    if n >= 2:\n        min_players[1] = 2\n    for k in range(2, n + 1):\n        min_players[k] = min_players[k-1] + min_players[k-2]\n        if min_players[k] > n:\n            break\n    while min_players[max_games] <= n:\n        if min_players[max_games + 1] > n:\n            break\n        max_games += 1\n    print(max_games)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Read the input number of players `n`.\n2. **Base Case Handling**: If there's only one player, no games are played.\n3. **Dynamic Array Initialization**: Initialize an array `min_players` where `min_players[k]` represents the minimum number of players needed for the winner to play `k` games.\n4. **Iterative Calculation**: Compute the minimum players required for each possible number of games starting from 2 up to `n`. This is done iteratively using the relation `min_players[k] = min_players[k-1] + min_players[k-2]`.\n5. **Determine Maximum Games**: Iterate through the precomputed values to find the largest number of games `max_games` such that the required players do not exceed `n`.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using dynamic programming and ensures that we handle all edge cases correctly.",
