The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Xenia is trying to complete her tasks by moving along a ringroad. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem statement says that Xenia lives in a city with n houses arranged in a ring. The traffic is one-way and clockwise. She starts at house 1 and has m tasks. For each task i, she must be at house ai, and she needs to have completed all tasks with numbers less than i before. So the order of tasks matters because each subsequent task depends on the previous ones being done.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the tasks are given as a list, but she needs to process them in the order from 1 to m. So for task i, she must have done all j < i first. That means she must visit a_1, then a_2, ..., up to a_m in order. Or is it that the tasks can be processed in any order as long as all earlier-numbered tasks are done before the current one? Hmm, the problem says \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\" So for each task i, all j < i must have been done before. So the order in which she processes the tasks is 1, 2, 3,...,m. Because each task depends on the previous ones being completed.\n\nWait, but the second example input is '4 3\\n2 3 3' and the output is 2. Let me see what happens there. So the sequence of moves is 1 -> 2 (task 1). Then she does task 2 at 3. Then task 3 at 3 again. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the task structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to think about it is that the tasks are processed in the order given, and for each task i, she must be at ai when she completes it. So the order is 1, 2, 3,..., m. But she can choose when to do each task, but each task must be done after all the previous ones are done.\n\nBut how does that translate into movement along the ring?\n\nHmm. Let's think of the first example:\n\nInput: 4 3\n\nTasks: 3, 2, 3.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nShe needs to do task 1 (a1=3) next. So she moves from 1 to 2, then to 3. Time taken: 2 steps.\n\nThen she needs to do task 2 (a2=2). So from 3, she goes back to 2, which is one step. So total time so far is 3.\n\nThen task 3 is a3=3. So she doesn't need to move anywhere; she's already there. So total time is 3 + 1 (from 3 to 2) plus 0 for the third task, but wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the example's output is 6. Oh, right, let me re-examine the note. The sequence given in the note is 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. So that's 6 steps. Let's see why:\n\n- Task 1: go from 1 to 3. Time taken is 2 steps.\nWait no, in the note, the first task is a1=3, so she starts at 1, then goes to 2 (step 1), then 3 (step 2). So task 1 is done at step 2.\n\nThen for task 2: a2=2. She's currently at 3, so she needs to get to 2. She moves to 4 (step 3), then to 1 (step4?), wait no, the ring is 1-2-3-4-1, right? So moving from 3 to 2 would be one step clockwise? Or is the ring a circular arrangement, and movement is only in the clockwise direction. So each adjacent house is the next in the clockwise order.\n\nSo from 3, the next is 4, then 1, then 2, then 3. So to get from 3 to 2, you have to go through 4, 1, and 2. That's three steps.\n\nWait, but in the note, the movement is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. So that's 6 steps. Let's count:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nStep 1: 1→2.\n\nStep 2: 2→3.\n\nStep 3: 3→4.\n\nStep 4:4→1.\n\nStep5:1→2.\n\nStep6:2→3.\n\nSo task 1 is done at step 2 (arrive at 3).\n\nTask 2 is done at step5 (arrive at 2). But wait, why isn't task 2 done earlier? Because the note's explanation says she's doing all the tasks in the order 1,2,3, etc. So perhaps the way to model this is that each task must be done in the order of their indices, but the movement is optimized such that each step is as efficient as possible.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to model the movement as follows: she must process the tasks in the order 1, 2, ..., m. Each time she processes task i, she must be at a_i. So the initial position is 1. Then for each task i, she moves from her current position to a_i, and the time taken is the minimal steps needed to reach a_i from the current position, considering the ring structure.\n\nWait, but the movement is always clockwise. So moving from position x to y can be done either by going clockwise or counter-clockwise, but since the ring is one-way, she can only move in the clockwise direction.\n\nWait, no. The ring is one-way and clockwise. So movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction. So each move is to the next house in the clockwise order. So from any house x, the next is x+1, except for the last house, which wraps around to 1.\n\nSo to get from x to y, the minimal time is the number of steps moving clockwise from x to y. Because you can't move counter-clockwise.\n\nSo for any two houses x and y, the distance between them is (y - x) mod n, but only if that's the shortest path in the clockwise direction.\n\nWait, let's take an example: n=4. So positions are 1,2,3,4.\n\nDistance from 3 to 2 is (2-3) mod 4 = (-1 mod4)=3 steps. But moving clockwise, 3→4→1→2 is 3 steps. Alternatively, could there be a shorter way? No, because movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction.\n\nSo the distance between x and y is (y -x) if y >=x, else (y -x +n).\n\nSo, in general, the minimal steps to reach y from x is (y -x) % n if moving clockwise.\n\nWait, but (y -x) mod n gives the right value. For example:\n\ny=2, x=3: 2-3= -1 mod4=3 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSo now, the problem is to process the tasks in the order 1, 2, ..., m, and for each task i, compute the minimal steps needed to go from the current position to a_i, adding all these steps together.\n\nSo the initial position is 1. Then for each i from 1 to m, we move to a_i, taking (a_i - current_pos) mod n steps, and add that to the total time.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's test this with the first example.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=4, m=3.\n\nTasks are 3,2,3.\n\nSo processing in order:\n\ni=1: current_pos is 1. Need to go to 3. Steps: (3-1) mod4=2. Total time +=2 → 2.\n\ni=2: current_pos is 3. Need to go to 2. Steps: (2-3) mod4=3. Total time +=3 →5.\n\ni=3: current_pos is 2. Need to go to 3. Steps: (3-2) mod4=1. Total time +=1 →6.\n\nWhich matches the sample output of 6.\n\nSecond example:\n\nInput is 4 3, tasks are 2,3,3.\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=1: current_pos=1 → move to 2. Steps (2-1)=1 → total 1.\n\ni=2: current_pos=2 → move to 3. Steps (3-2)=1 → total 2.\n\ni=3: current_pos=3 → move to 3. Steps 0 → total remains 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach seems to work.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n- Sort the array a in increasing order (since the tasks must be done in order 1,2,...m). Wait, no! Wait, the input is given as a list of a1,a2,...am, which may not be in order. Because in the problem statement, it's written that she needs to have done all tasks with numbers less than i before. So the order of processing is the order of the indices, regardless of the order of the array.\n\nWait, no, wait. The problem says, the second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am. These are the required positions for each task. So for task i, she must be at ai. So the order is 1, 2, ..., m. So for each i, she must process task i, which requires being at ai, and then proceed to the next.\n\nSo the order of the array is fixed as per the input. So the tasks are processed in the order they are given.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the first sample input, the array is [3,2,3]. Processing in that order, but in the note, the movement is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. So for i=1, she is at 3, i=2 she is at 2, etc.\n\nSo the order is indeed fixed as per the input. So the processing is in the order of the input array.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize current_pos =1, time=0.\n\nFor each a in the list a1, a2,... am:\n\n   compute the steps needed to move from current_pos to a, which is (a - current_pos) mod n.\n\n   add this to time.\n\n   update current_pos to a.\n\nSo the total time is the sum of all these steps.\n\nWait, but what about when a is less than current_pos?\n\nLike, in the first sample, moving from 3 to 2 is (2-3) mod4=3 steps. Which is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem is to read the input, process the array, and compute the sum of steps as described.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's.\n\nSort the list? No, wait, no. Because the order matters. For example, in the first sample, the list is [3,2,3], and the movement is as per that order.\n\nSo, no, we don't sort. We just process the list as is.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntime =0\n\nfor each num in a_list:\n\n    steps = (num - current) % n\n\n    time += steps\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(time)\n\nWait, but let's test this with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=4, m=3, a_list=[3,2,3]\n\nSteps:\n\ncurrent =1.\n\n3-1=2 → time=2.\n\ncurrent=3.\n\n2-3= -1 mod4=3 → time +=3 →5.\n\ncurrent=2.\n\n3-2=1 → time +=1 →6.\n\nCorrect.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=4, a_list = [2,3,3].\n\ncurrent=1.\n\n2-1=1 → time=1.\n\ncurrent=2.\n\n3-2=1 → time=2.\n\ncurrent=3.\n\n3-3=0 → time remains 2.\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnother test case: what if a list is [1,1,1]?\n\nn=5.\n\nEach step is 0, so time is 0.\n\nAnother test: n=5, a_list = [5,1,5].\n\nLet's see:\n\ncurrent=1.\n\n5-1=4 → time=4.\n\ncurrent=5.\n\n1-5= -4 mod5=1. So steps:1. Time becomes 5.\n\ncurrent=1.\n\n5-1=4. Time 9.\n\nSo total time is 9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nWait, but what about when the same a occurs multiple times. Like in the second sample, where a is 3 twice. The code just adds 0 for the second occurrence, which is correct.\n\nSo the code is simple: process each a in the given order, compute the steps as (a - current) mod n, add to the time.\n\nSo now, in Python, the code would look like this:\n\nRead n and m from the first line.\n\nThen read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute as above.\n\nSo code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\nfor num in a:\n    steps = (num - current) % n\n    total_time += steps\n    current = num\nprint(total_time)\n\nThat's it. Seems straightforward.\n\nTesting it against the samples:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nCode outputs 6.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3\n\nOutput is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=4, a = [1,2,3,4]. So movement is 0 steps each time. Output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, a=[5,4,3,2,1]. So steps:\n\ncurrent=1.\n\n5-1=4 → add 4.\n\ncurrent=5.\n\n4-5= -1 mod5=4 → add 4. Total 8.\n\ncurrent=4.\n\n3-4= -1 mod5=4 → add4 →12.\n\ncurrent=3.\n\n2-3= -1 mod5=4 → add4 →16.\n\ncurrent=2.\n\n1-2= -1 mod5=4 → add4 →20.\n\nTotal 20.\n\nSo yes, the code handles all cases.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks if she starts at house number 1 and moves clockwise along a ringroad. Each task must be completed in the order given, and she must be at the specified house when each task is completed.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to move clockwise to complete each task in the given order. The movement from one house to the next takes exactly one unit of time.\n2. **Intuition**: Since the ringroad is one-way and clockwise, the shortest path between two houses is determined by moving clockwise around the ring. The distance from house `x` to house `y` can be calculated as `(y - x) % n`.\n3. **Algorithm**: \n   - Initialize the current position at house 1.\n   - For each task in the given order, compute the minimal steps required to move from the current position to the target house using the formula `(target - current) % n`.\n   - Sum these steps to get the total time taken to complete all tasks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\nfor num in a:\n    steps = (num - current) % n\n    total_time += steps\n    current = num\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line reads the list of target houses for each task.\n2. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with a total time of 0.\n3. **Processing Each Task**: For each target house in the task list, calculate the steps needed to move clockwise from the current house to the target house using the modulo operation. Update the total time and the current position.\n4. **Output**: Print the total time after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal time required by leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad.",
