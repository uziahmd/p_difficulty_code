During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.Neko has two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $$$k$$$ such that the least common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $$$k$$$, he needs to choose the smallest one.Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b \\le 10^9$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint the smallest non-negative integer $$$k$$$ ($$$k \\ge 0$$$) such that the lowest common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible.If there are many possible integers $$$k$$$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 10', '21 31', '5 10']\n\n### Output\n['2', '9', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test, one should choose $$$k = 2$$$, as the least common multiple of $$$6 + 2$$$ and $$$10 + 2$$$ is $$$24$$$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where given two integers a and b, I have to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a+k) and (b+k) is minimized. And if there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest one.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's happening when we add k to both a and b. The new numbers are a + k and b + k. But wait, since a and b could be in any order, maybe I should first compute the difference between them. Oh right, because if a is larger than b, then adding k to both doesn't change their difference. So the difference is fixed as |a - b|. Let's denote d = |a - b|.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding k such that the two numbers x = a + k and y = b + k have their LCM minimized. Since x and y differ by d, which is fixed, perhaps the optimal k can be found by considering their greatest common divisor (gcd).\n\nWait, because for two numbers x and y, LCM(x, y) = (x * y) / GCD(x, y). So to minimize the LCM, we need to maximize the GCD of x and y.\n\nSo our goal is to maximize the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k), which is equal to the GCD of (d, a +k). Because (a +k) and (b +k) have a difference of d, their GCD must divide d. So the maximum possible GCD is a divisor of d.\n\nThat's an important insight. So the optimal k will make (a +k) divisible by some divisor g of d, and the higher the g, the better, because it increases the GCD, thus reducing the LCM.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|. If d is zero, then a and b are equal, so adding any k won't change their values, so the LCM is just a (or b). So the best k is 0.\n\n2. Otherwise, find all divisors of d.\n\n3. For each divisor g of d (from largest to smallest?), compute the required k such that (a +k) mod g == 0. Then, among all possible k's that satisfy this, choose the one with the smallest k value (since the problem says if multiple k's give the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k).\n\nWait, but how do I find the correct k for each g?\n\nLet me think: For each g dividing d, I want (a +k) mod g == 0. So, a +k ≡ 0 mod g → k ≡ (-a) mod g. So the smallest non-negative k for this is (g - a % g) % g. Wait, no: because if a mod g is zero, then k needs to be 0 mod g. So the minimal k for this g is (g - (a % g)) % g. Wait, let's see:\n\nSuppose a mod g is r. Then, (a +k) mod g = 0 → k mod g = (-r) mod g → which is (g - r) mod g. So the minimal k is (g - r) if r != 0, else 0.\n\nYes. So for each divisor g of d, compute k = (g - (a % g)) % g. Then, check if adding this k gives a valid solution. But wait, because when we add k, the other number is b +k = (a +k) + d. Because a +k and b +k differ by d. So if a +k is divisible by g, then b +k is also divisible by g because d is a multiple of g.\n\nSo the GCD of (a +k, b +k) is exactly g, which is a divisor of d. So the maximum possible g is the one that gives the maximum possible GCD, which in turn gives the minimal LCM.\n\nBut wait, how do I know which g to choose? Because for different g's, the k might vary, and the resulting LCM could be the same or different.\n\nWait, the LCM is (x * y) / g, where x and y are a +k and b +k, and their GCD is g. Since x = a +k = m * g, y = b +k = n * g, and x - y = d = g * (m - n). So m - n = d / g.\n\nBut since m and n are coprime (because the GCD is g), the LCM is m * n * g.\n\nBut m and n are (x/g) and (y/g",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \\( k \\) that yield the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key insight is that the difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) remains constant when \\( k \\) is added to both. This difference is denoted as \\( d = |a - b| \\). The LCM of two numbers can be minimized by maximizing their greatest common divisor (GCD). Therefore, we need to find the maximum possible GCD of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\), which must be a divisor of \\( d \\).\n\n2. **Divisors of \\( d \\)**: We compute all divisors of \\( d \\). For each divisor \\( g \\), we determine the smallest \\( k \\) such that \\( a + k \\) is divisible by \\( g \\). This \\( k \\) is calculated as \\( (g - (a \\% g)) \\% g \\).\n\n3. **Optimal \\( k \\)**: Among all possible \\( k \\) values derived from the divisors, we select the one that yields the smallest LCM.
