He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine for each of the 2n-2 given strings whether it's a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. The output is a string where each character is either 'P' or 'S' based on that classification.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. The main idea is that for each possible string length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings: one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. But wait, no—wait, the problem says that each length from 1 to n-1 has exactly two strings, but they could be both prefixes, both suffixes, or one of each. No, no, wait: Ivan provided all improper prefixes and suffixes, so for each length l (1<=l<=n-1), there are two strings: one is a prefix, the other is a suffix.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem statement says that the input contains all the prefixes and suffixes of s, each of length 1 to n-1, but not necessarily grouped by length. So for each l, there are two strings, but their types could vary.\n\nWait, but in reality, for the original string s of length n, the l-length prefixes are all s[0..l-1], and the l-length suffixes are s[l..n-1]. So for each l, among the two strings, one must be a prefix and the other a suffix. Because the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be correct, meaning that for each l, the two strings are the prefix and suffix.\n\nSo, for each l, among the two strings in that group, one is the prefix, and the other is the suffix. But wait, the way the input is structured is that it's a list of 2n-2 strings, each of varying lengths. So, for each l in 1..n-1, there are two strings: one is the prefix of length l, the other is the suffix of length l.\n\nSo the first step is to group the input strings by their lengths. Because for each length l, we'll have two strings: one is the prefix, the other is the suffix.\n\nOnce I have these groups, I can process them in order of increasing l. Because for each l, the prefix of l is a substring of the prefix of l+1, right? Similarly, the suffix of l is a substring of the suffix of l-1.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because for example, the prefix of l+1 is the prefix of l plus the next character. So, the prefix of l is the first l characters of the prefix of l+1. Similarly, the suffix of l is the last l characters of the suffix of l+1. Or wait, maybe I have that backwards. Let me think: the suffix of length l is the last l characters of the string s. So, the suffix of l+1 is the last l+1 characters, which includes the suffix of l as its last l characters. So, the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1 without the last character. Hmm, not exactly. Wait, the suffix of length l is s[n-l..n-1], and the suffix of length l+1 is s[n-(l+1)..n-1]. So, the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1 without the last character.\n\nSo, for the prefixes and suffixes, for each l, the prefix is a string of length l, and for l+1, the prefix is the previous prefix plus the next character. Similarly, the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1 without the last character.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to proceed is to find for each l, which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix. Once we know that, we can build the entire string s incrementally.\n\nBut how do I find out which is the prefix and which is the suffix for each l?\n\nAh, here's an idea: for each l, the prefix of l must be a prefix of the suffix of l. Because the prefix of l is the first l characters of s, and the suffix of l is the last l characters of s. Therefore, the prefix of l is a substring of s, and the suffix of l is another substring. But how does that help us determine which is which?\n\nAlternatively, for l=1, the two strings are the single-character prefix and the single-character suffix. For example, if s starts with 'a', then the prefix is 'a' and the suffix is 'a' as well if s is 'aaa...a'. But wait, in that case, both are 'a', so they can't be distinguished. So, in that case, for l=1, both strings are 'a'—so it's ambiguous. But according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be such that at least one possible string s exists.\n\nWait, but when l=1, the two strings are the same, so the assignment can be either both P or both S. But since the output requires that the number of P's and S's are equal, perhaps that's not directly applicable. Hmm, but for each l, exactly one of the two is the prefix and the other is the suffix. Unless for some l, the two strings are the same, like both being 'a' for l=1. Then, it's impossible to distinguish which is which.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is such that it's possible for at least one string s to satisfy the conditions. So, for each l, the two strings may be the same, but for the overall arrangement, it's possible to assign which is P and which is S in a way that allows s to exist.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to construct possible candidates for s, and for each candidate, check whether all the given strings are consistent as either prefixes or suffixes.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 100, trying all possibilities might be computationally expensive. So, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, another approach: for each possible candidate s, check whether for each l, the given strings for l are exactly the prefix and suffix of s. But even that could be time-consuming because the number of possible s is 26^100, which is way too big.\n\nSo, perhaps a better approach is to model the problem as building s step by step, determining for each l whether the two strings are the prefix and/or suffix.\n\nLet me think about the structure.\n\nFor each l from 1 to n-1:\n\nWe have two strings, A and B, of length l.\n\nOne of them is the prefix of s, the other is the suffix.\n\nBut how to determine which is which.\n\nWait, for l=1, the two strings are the first and last characters of s. So, the prefix is s[0], the suffix is s[-1]. So, if for l=1, the two strings are 'a' and 'b', then the prefix is 'a' and the suffix is 'b', so s starts with 'a' and ends with 'b'.\n\nSimilarly, for l=2, the two strings are the first two characters (prefix) and the last two (suffix). But the suffix of l=2 is the last two of s, which must be a suffix of the suffix of l=3, etc. So, perhaps the way to model this is to arrange the prefixes and suffixes in a way that builds s step by step.\n\nWait, but how to find for each l which is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nAnother thought: the prefix of l must be the same as the prefix of l-1 plus the next character. Similarly, the suffix of l must be the suffix of l-1 minus the first character (or wait, no—since the suffix of l is the last l characters, which is the suffix of l+1 minus the last character).\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that for each l, the suffix of l is the last l characters of s, and the suffix of l+1 is the last l+1 characters. So, the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1 without the last character.\n\nSimilarly, the prefix of l is the prefix of l-1 plus the next character.\n\nSo, perhaps for each l, the two given strings for that l must be compatible with the previous assignments.\n\nWait, but how to model that.\n\nAlternatively, for each l, the two strings for that l must be the prefix and the suffix, in some order. And for l+1, the prefix is the previous prefix plus a character, and the suffix is the previous suffix minus the first character.\n\nWait, maybe not exactly. Let's see:\n\nSuppose for l=1, the two strings are 'a' and 'b'. So, the prefix is 'a', the suffix is 'b'. Then, for l=2, the prefix would be 'ab', and the suffix would be 'xb' (where x is the second last character of s). Wait, no—because the suffix of l=2 is the last two characters of s, which could be anything. So, the suffix of l=2 could be 'bb' if s ends with 'bb', for example.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to model this as a graph, where for each l, the two possible options (prefix and suffix) must fit into the existing structure.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to build the possible s step by step, starting from l=1 and moving upwards.\n\nHere's an idea: for each l, the prefix is built by adding one character to the prefix of l-1, and the suffix is built by removing the first character from the suffix of l-1.\n\nWait, that's not accurate. Wait, the prefix of l is the prefix of l-1 plus s[l], which is the next character. Similarly, the suffix of l is the last l characters of s, which is the last l+1 characters of s minus the first character. So, the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1 without the last character.\n\nSo, for each l, the suffix of l must be the suffix of l+1 with the last character removed.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, let's think about it in terms of building s from the end. Because for l = n-1, the suffix is the last n-1 characters of s, which is s[1..n-1]. Then, the suffix of l = n-2 is s[2..n-1], and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to proceed is to start from the largest l and work our way down.\n\nWait, for l = n-1, the two strings are the suffix of s of length n-1. Since the suffix of l = n-1 is s[1..n-1], and the suffix of l = n-2 is s[2..n-1], which is the suffix of l = n-1 with the first character removed.\n\nSo, the suffix of l = n-2 is the suffix of l = n-1 with the first character removed.\n\nSimilarly, the suffix of l = n-3 is the suffix of l = n-2 with the first character removed.\n\nWait, that suggests that for l in decreasing order, the suffix is built by removing the first character from the suffix of l+1.\n\nSimilarly, for prefixes, the prefix of l is the prefix of l-1 plus the next character.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to choose for each l which of the two strings is the suffix and which is the prefix, ensuring that the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1 with the first character removed.\n\nBut how do I model this for each l.\n\nLet's think in terms of the maximum possible l, which is n-1.\n\nAt l = n-1, the two strings are the suffix of s of length n-1. So, for l = n-1, the two given strings must be such that one is the suffix of l = n-1. But how to determine which is which.\n\nWait, but the suffix of l = n-1 is s[1..n-1], which is s without the first character. So, the suffix of l = n-1 is the suffix of s of length n-1.\n\nSimilarly, for l = n-2, the suffix is s[2..n-1], which is the suffix of l = n-1 with the first character removed.\n\nSo, for each l, the suffix of l must be the suffix of l+1 with the first character removed.\n\nSo, for each l, when we have the two strings for that l, one of them must be the suffix of l+1 after removing the first character.\n\nBut how to find which one is which.\n\nThis suggests that for each l, the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1 with the first character removed.\n\nSo, for l = n-1, the two strings are the suffix of l = n-1. So, one of them is the suffix of n-1.\n\nBut how to know which one it is.\n\nWait, but for l = n-1, the suffix is s[1..n-1], which is the same as the suffix of s of length n-1. So, for l = n-1, the two strings are the suffix of s of length n-1, but that's the same as s itself except the first character.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to proceed is to look for the longest possible suffix and then backtrack.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each l from n-1 down to 1, determine the suffix and prefix based on the previous step.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck.\n\nMaybe another approach is needed.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWe can model the possible s as a trie, and for each possible prefix and suffix, try to build s step by step.\n\nBut that sounds computationally heavy.\n\nWait, but since n is up to 100, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nWait, perhaps for each position in s, we can track the possible characters it can take based on the constraints from the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that for each l, the two strings are either the prefix and the suffix. So, for each l, one of the two strings is the prefix, and the other is the suffix.\n\nMoreover, for l+1, the prefix must be the prefix of l plus one character, and the suffix must be the suffix of l+1 without the first character.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's see: for l, the prefix is s[0..l-1]. For l+1, the prefix is s[0..l], which is the previous prefix plus s[l].\n\nSimilarly, the suffix of l is s[n-l..n-1], and the suffix of l+1 is s[n-l-1..n-1], which is the suffix of l with s[n-l-1] added to the front.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the suffix of l is s[n-l..n-1], and the suffix of l+1 is s[n-(l+1)..n-1], which is s[n-l-1..n-1]. So, the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1 without the first character. Because s[n-l-1..n-1] is s[n-l-1], s[n-l], ..., s[n-1], which is the same as the suffix of l+1.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let's see:\n\nIf l+1 is the length, then the suffix of l+1 is the last l+1 characters of s. The suffix of l is the last l characters, which is the suffix of l+1 without the first character.\n\nYes! So, for each l, the suffix of l is equal to the suffix of l+1 with the first character removed.\n\nSimilarly, the prefix of l is the prefix of l-1 plus the next character.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings for that l are the prefix (which is the same as the prefix of l-1 plus the next character) and the suffix (which is the suffix of l+1 without the first character).\n\nWait, but that's only if l < n. Because for l = n-1, the suffix of l+1 doesn't exist (since l+1 = n, which is the length of s). So, for l = n-1, the suffix is just the suffix of s, which is the last n-1 characters.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to model this is to reconstruct the string s by starting from the largest possible l and working backward.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, for l = n-1, the two strings are the suffix of l = n-1. So, one is the suffix of s, and the other is the suffix of s without the first character. Wait, no—no, for l = n-1, the suffix of l is s[1..n-1]. So, the two strings for l = n-1 are s[1..n-1] and ... Wait, no. Because for l = n-1, the two strings are the suffix of s of length n-1 and what else? Oh, wait, no—the problem states that for each l from 1 to n-1, the input has exactly two strings. So, for l = n-1, the two strings are the suffix of s of length n-1. But that can't be, because the suffix of s of length n-1 is s[1..n-1], and the other string is another string of the same length. So, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that for each l from 1 to n-1, the input has two strings. Each of them is either a prefix or a suffix of s.\n\nSo, for l = n-1, the two strings are the prefix and the suffix of s of length n-1.\n\nWait, but the prefix of s of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix is s[1..n-1]. So, for l = n-1, the two strings are s[0..n-2] (prefix) and s[1..n-1] (suffix).\n\nSo, for l = n-1, the two strings are the prefix and the suffix of s of length n-1.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings are the prefix and suffix of s of length l.\n\nSo, for l = 1, it's the first character (prefix) and the last character (suffix) of s.\n\nNow, the plan is to find for each l, which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nOnce we have that, we can build the entire string s.\n\nBut how?\n\nThe idea is that for each l, the prefix is a certain string, and the suffix is another. Then, for l+1, the prefix is the prefix of l plus the next character, and the suffix is the suffix of l+1 without the first character.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for l+1, the suffix is the last l+1 characters of s. So, the suffix of l is the last l characters of s, which is the suffix of l+1 without the first character.\n\nSo, for each l, the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1 with the first character removed.\n\nThus, for each l, the suffix of l must be equal to the suffix of l+1 with the first character removed.\n\nSo, for each l, when we have the two possible strings for l, one must be the suffix of l and the other must be the suffix of l+1, which when the first character is removed gives the suffix of l.\n\nWait, but for l = n-1, l+1 is n, which is beyond the allowed lengths. So, for l = n-1, the suffix of l+1 doesn't exist. So, for l = n-1, the suffix is the suffix of s of length n-1, which is s[1..n-1], and the suffix of l+1 is s[0..n-1], but that's the entire string s. So, the suffix of l = n-1 is the suffix of l+1 without the first character.\n\nSo, for l = n-1, the two strings are the suffix of l and the suffix of l+1, which is s.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is as follows:\n\nStart with l = n-1.\n\nWe have two strings: s1 and s2, both of length n-1.\n\nWe need to determine which is the suffix of l = n-1 (i.e., s[1..n-1]) and which is the suffix of l+1 = n (i.e., s[0..n-1]).\n\nBut wait, the suffix of l+1 is s itself. So, the suffix of l+1 is the entire string s.\n\nSo, for l = n-1, the suffix of l is s[1..n-1], which is s without the first character. The suffix of l+1 is s.\n\nTherefore, the suffix of l+1 is the suffix of l+1 = n, which is s. So, the suffix of l is s[1..n-1], which is the suffix of l+1 without the first character.\n\nSo, for l = n-1, the two strings are s[1..n-1] and s[0..n-1]. So, the suffix of l = n-1 is s[1..n-1], which is the other string. So, for l = n-1, the two strings are s[1..n-1] and s. So, one of them is the suffix of l = n-1, and the other is the suffix of l+1 = n.\n\nWait, but in the input, for l = n-1, the two strings are both of length n-1. So, for l = n-1, the two strings cannot include the full string s, because s has length n. So, perhaps my earlier reasoning is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says that for each l from 1 to n-1, there are two strings of length l that are either prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nSo, for l = n-1, the two strings are the prefix of s of length n-1 and the suffix of s of length n-1.\n\nBecause the prefix of s of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix is s[1..n-1].\n\nBoth of these are of length n-1.\n\nSo, for l = n-1, the two strings are s[0..n-2] and s[1..n-1], each of length n-1.\n\nSo, for l = n-1, the two strings are the prefix and the suffix of s of length n-1.\n\nSo, for l = n-1, the two strings are the two possible n-1 length strings.\n\nNow, the approach is to process l from n-1 down to 1.\n\nFor each l, determine which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nOnce we have that, we can build the string s.\n\nWait, but how.\n\nLet me think:\n\nFor l = n-1:\n\nThe two strings are the prefix (s[0..n-2]) and the suffix (s[1..n-1]).\n\nSo, for l = n-1, the two strings are s[0..n-2] and s[1..n-1].\n\nNow, for l = n-2:\n\nThe two strings are the prefix (s[0..n-3]) and the suffix (s[2..n-1]).\n\nBut the suffix of l = n-2 must be the suffix of l+1 (n-1) without the first character. So, the suffix of l = n-2 is s[2..n-1] = s[1..n-1] (suffix of l+1) without the first character (s[1]).\n\nWait, no: the suffix of l = n-2 is s[2..n-1], which is the suffix of l+1 (n-1) minus the first character (s[1]).\n\nWait, the suffix of l = n-1 is s[1..n-1], so the suffix of l = n-2 is s[2..n-1], which is the suffix of l = n-1 without the first character (s[1]).\n\nSo, for l = n-2, the suffix must be the suffix of l = n-1 with the first character removed.\n\nSo, for l = n-2, among the two strings, one must be the suffix of l = n-1 (without the first character), and the other must be the prefix of l = n-2.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. For l from n-1 down to 1:\n\n   a. For each l, collect the two strings for that l.\n\n   b. Among these two, determine which is the suffix (for l) and which is the prefix (for l).\n\n   c. Ensure that the suffix for l is the suffix for l+1 without the first character.\n\n   d. Also, ensure that the prefix for l is the prefix for l-1 plus the next character.\n\nBut how do we implement this.\n\nPerhaps, for each l, we can try all possible combinations of assigning the two strings to prefix and suffix, and see if it leads to a consistent assignment for the rest of the l's.\n\nBut since n is up to 100, this approach may be feasible.\n\nBut how to manage this.\n\nAnother Idea: We can model the problem as building the string s step by step. For each l, after determining the prefix and suffix, we can compute the next character or the previous character.\n\nWait, for l = n-1:\n\nWe have two strings: p and q, which are the prefix (s[0..n-2]) and the suffix (s[1..n-1]).\n\nWe don't know which is which yet.\n\nSo, for l = n-1, the two possibilities are:\n\nCase 1: p is the prefix, q is the suffix.\n\nThen, s[0..n-2] = p, s[1..n-1] = q.\n\nSo, s can be constructed as p + last_char_of_q.\n\nBut wait, the suffix is s[1..n-1] = q, which is of length n-1. So, the entire s would be p concatenated with the last character of q.\n\nBut wait, s is of length n. So, p is of length n-1, and the last character is the last character of q.\n\nSo, s = p + last_char(q).\n\nBut wait, q is the suffix of l = n-1, which is s[1..n-1]. So, s[1..n-1] is q, and s[0] is p[0].\n\nSo, s is p[0] followed by q.\n\nWhich would be a string of length n.\n\nBut how to confirm that this is valid.\n\nAlternatively, in this case, for l = n-2:\n\nThe two strings are the prefix of l = n-2 (s[0..n-3]) and the suffix of l = n-2 (s[2..n-1]).\n\nThe suffix of l = n-2 is s[2..n-1], which should be equal to the suffix of l = n-1 (q) without the first character (s[1]).\n\nSo, s[2..n-1] should be equal to q[1..n-2], assuming q is of length n-1.\n\nSo, for this case, when l = n-1 is assigned as p being the prefix and q being the suffix, we can compute the suffix for l = n-2 as q[1..n-2].\n\nSo, the two strings for l = n-2 are:\n\nprefix_candidate = s[0..n-3]\n\nsuffix_candidate = s[2..n-1] = q[1..n-2]\n\nSo, for l = n-2, the two strings must be prefix_candidate and suffix_candidate, which are the two given strings for that l.\n\nSo, the idea is to, for each l, try all possible assignments of the two strings to prefix and suffix, and see if the assignment is consistent with the previous l's.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nPerhaps, for each l from n-1 down to 1:\n\nWe have two possible options for the current l: which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nWe can represent this as a tree of possibilities, where for each l, we branch into the two possible assignments, and for each branch, we check whether the assignment is compatible with the previous l's.\n\nBut for n=100, this approach could lead to a lot of branches, but perhaps manageable.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Group the input strings by their lengths. So, for each l, we have a list of two strings.\n\n2. For l from n-1 down to 1:\n\n   a. Take the two strings for this l.\n\n   b. Try both possibilities: assign s_prefix as the first string, s_suffix as the second; and assign s_prefix as the second string, s_suffix as the first.\n\n   c. For each possibility, check if s_suffix is equal to the suffix of l+1 with the first character removed.\n\n   d. Also, check if s_prefix is compatible with the prefix of l-1 (if l > 1).\n\n   e. If a possibility is valid, proceed recursively to l-1.\n\n3. Once a valid assignment is found, build the string s and mark all the given strings as either P or S.\n\nBut implementing this recursively may be computationally intensive for n=100.\n\nAn alternative approach is to represent the possible current state as the current possible s, and for each step, update it based on the possible assignments.\n\nBut again, for n=100, this could be challenging.\n\nWait, perhaps another Idea: since for each l, the suffix of l must be the suffix of l+1 without the first character, perhaps the suffix for l can be determined once the suffix for l+1 is known.\n\nSo, for l from n-1 down to 1:\n\n   a. For each of the two possible strings for l, check if it can be the suffix of l by seeing if it is equal to the suffix of l+1 without the first character.\n\n   b. Once the suffix is determined, the prefix is the other string.\n\nBut how to handle the dependencies between l's.\n\nLet me see with an example.\n\nTake the sample input where n=5 and the output is \"ababa\".\n\nThe input strings are grouped by length:\n\nLength 1: 'a' and 'b'\n\nLength 2: 'ab', 'ba'\n\nLength 3: 'aba', 'aab'\n\nLength 4: 'abab', 'baba'\n\nWait, no, the actual grouping is per length, but the initial input is a list of 2n-2=8 strings.\n\nBut perhaps for each l, the two strings are given in the input.\n\nSo, for l=1, two strings are 'a' and 'b'.\n\nFor l=2, two strings are 'ab' and 'ba'.\n\nFor l=3, two strings are 'aba' and 'aab'.\n\nFor l=4, two strings are 'abab' and 'baba'.\n\nSo, for l=5-1=4.\n\nWe need to determine which is the suffix of l=4 and which is the prefix.\n\nWait, for l=4, the two strings are 'abab' and 'baba'.\n\nWhich one is the suffix of l=4 (s[1..4]), and which is the suffix of l=5 (the entire string s)?\n\nWait, the suffix of l=4 is s[1..4], which is of length 4.\n\nThe suffix of l=5 is the entire string s, which is of length 5, which is beyond the input strings.\n\nSo, perhaps for l=4, the two strings are the prefix (s[0..3]) and the suffix (s[1..4]).\n\nIn the sample, the correct s is 'ababa'.\n\nSo, the prefix of l=4 is 'abab' (s[0..3]) and the suffix is 'baba' (s[1..4]).\n\nSo, for l=4, the two strings are 'abab' and 'baba', which are the prefix and suffix respectively.\n\nSo, when processing l=4, the suffix must be the suffix of l=5, which is s itself. But l=5 is beyond the input, so perhaps the suffix of l=4 is the suffix of s without the first character.\n\nWait, perhaps for l=4, the suffix is s[1..4], which is s without the first character.\n\nSo, the suffix of l=4 is the suffix of s, excluding the first character.\n\nSo, for l=4, the two strings are s[0..3] and s[1..4].\n\nSo, the suffix of l=4 must be s[1..4], which is the suffix of s without the first character.\n\nSo, for l=4, among the two strings, one is s[0..3], the other is s[1..4].\n\nSo, to determine which is which, perhaps we can check whether the suffix of l=4 is the suffix of l=5 (which is s) without the first character.\n\nBut since l=5 is beyond the input, perhaps this is not directly applicable.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to process l from n-1 down to 1, and for each l, determine the suffix and prefix based on the next l's suffix.\n\nBut how.\n\nAnother Idea: For l = n-1, the two strings are the prefix and suffix of l = n-1.\n\nSo, for each possible combination of which is prefix and which is suffix, we can compute s as follows:\n\nCase 1: Suppose the first string is the prefix, the second is the suffix.\n\nThen, s is first_string + last character of second_string.\n\nBut wait, the second string is the suffix of l = n-1, which is s[1..n-1]. So, s[1..n-1] is second_string, and s[0] is first_string[0].\n\nSo, s is first_string[0] followed by second_string.\n\nSo, s = first_string[0] + second_string.\n\nSo, the length of s would be len(first_string) + 1 = (n-1) + 1 = n, which is correct.\n\nSo, for each possible assignment of the two strings for l = n-1, we can compute s and then check whether the other l's are consistent.\n\nSimilarly, for l = n-2, the two strings are the prefix and suffix of l = n-2.\n\nThe suffix of l = n-2 must be the suffix of l = n-1 without the first character.\n\nSo, for each case where s is determined for l = n-1, we can process l = n-2 and see if the two strings match.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For l = n-1:\n\n   a. Take the two strings for this l.\n\n   b. Try both possible assignments: first is prefix, second is suffix; and vice versa.\n\n   c. For each case, compute s as first_char + second_string.\n\n   d. Check if the computed s is valid for l = n-1, i.e., whether the two strings for l = n-1 are indeed the prefix and suffix.\n\n   e. For each valid s, proceed to process l = n-2.\n\n2. For l = n-2:\n\n   a. Take the two strings for this l.\n\n   b. For each possible assignment of prefix and suffix:\n\n      i. The suffix of l = n-2 must be equal to the suffix of l = n-1 (from the previously computed s) without the first character.\n\n      ii. The prefix of l = n-2 must be equal to s[0..n-3].\n\n   c. So, for each possible assignment, check if it matches the computed s.\n\n   d. If it does, proceed to l = n-3.\n\n3. Continue this process until all l's are processed.\n\n4. Once a complete s is found, assign all the input strings to P or S.\n\nBut implementing this requires checking all possible paths, which for n=100 could be computationally expensive.\n\nBut perhaps with memoization and pruning, it can be manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each possible way of assigning prefix and suffix for l = n-1:\n\n   - Compute s.\n\n   - For each l from n-2 downto 1:\n\n      - Get the two strings for l.\n\n      - Try both possible assignments (string A as prefix, string B as suffix; and vice versa).\n\n      - For each assignment:\n\n         - Check if the suffix of l is equal to the suffix of l+1 (from s) without the first character.\n\n         - Also, check if the prefix of l is equal to s[0..l-1].\n\n         - If yes, proceed to l-1.\n\n   - If a valid s is found, break and use it.\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string, determine if it's a prefix or suffix of s.\n\nSo, the code outline is as follows:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the 2n-2 strings into a list.\n\nGroup them by their lengths: a dictionary where keys are lengths, values are lists of two strings.\n\nFor l in 1..n-1, group the two strings.\n\nThen, for each possible assignment of prefix and suffix for l = n-1:\n\n   s = assignment.prefix[0] + assignment.suffix\n\n   for l in n-2 downto 1:\n\n      get the two strings for l.\n\n      for each possible assignment of which is prefix and which is suffix:\n\n         check if suffix matches (suffix of l+1)[1:].\n\n         also, check if prefix matches s[0:l].\n\n         if both conditions are met, proceed to next l.\n\n   if all l's are processed, then s is valid.\n\nOnce s is found, for each input string, determine if",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine for each of the given strings whether it is a prefix or a suffix of the original string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves reconstructing the string `s` by leveraging the properties of prefixes and suffixes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Strings by Length**: First, group the input strings by their lengths.
