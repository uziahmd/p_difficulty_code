He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to check if a given string can be formed in a specific way. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem says that the string is built in three steps. First, A creates a string of some 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's. So after this step, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends some 'c's, but the number of 'c's must equal either the number of 'a's or 'b's (or both). \n\nSo, the string must satisfy certain conditions:\n\n1. The order of the characters is first all 'a's, then all 'b's, then all 'c's. No interleaving allowed.\n2. There's at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n3. The count of 'c's must be equal to the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's.\n\nHmm, so I need to check these conditions for the given string.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll need to split the string into its 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's segments. Because the string should consist of a's followed by b's followed by c's. So the string can't have any other characters before a's, between a's and b's, between b's and c's, etc.\n\nSo the first thing is to check if the string is in the form of aaa...bbb...ccc... with no other characters.\n\nHow can I do that? Well, I can iterate through the string and see if it transitions from a to b to c exactly once each, and that all a's are before any b's, which are before any c's.\n\nWait, more precisely, the string can have zero or more a's, followed by zero or more b's, followed by zero or more c's. But wait, no: according to the note, after A and B, there's at least one a and one b. Then C appends some c's, so the final string must have at least one a, one b, and one c.\n\nSo the string must start with a's, then b's, then c's. And the counts of each part must be at least 1.\n\nSo the structure is like: a+ b+ c+, but all in sequence without mixing.\n\nSo, for example, a valid string would be 'aabbc', but something like 'ababc' is invalid because the b's come after a's but then a comes again.\n\nSo, to check this, I can process the string and see if it's strictly non-decreasing in terms of the character order a < b < c.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to find the positions where the characters change from a to b and from b to c. These points must occur exactly once each, and the string must not have any other changes.\n\nAlternatively, I can split the string into runs of the same character and check that the runs are a, then b, then c. And each run occurs exactly once, except for the possibility of zero in some runs, but no—since the counts are at least one.\n\nWait, no. Because after A gives the string to B, there's at least one a and one b. Then C appends c's, so the total string must have at least one a, one b, and one c.\n\nSo the runs must be a, then b, then c, each run having length at least one.\n\nSo, for the string to be valid, it must be possible to split it into exactly three parts: a's, then b's, then c's, each part having at least one character.\n\nSo, let's think about how to implement that.\n\nOne approach is to find the indices where the string changes from 'a' to 'b' and from 'b' to 'c'.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input 'aaabccc':\n\n- The first change is from a to b at index 3 (0-based?), then from b to c at index 5.\n\nBut wait, in the string 'aaabccc', the a's end at position 3 (indices 0,1,2), then the b's start at 3 (only one b), then c's start at 4.\n\nWait, perhaps the transition points can be found by checking the first occurrence of 'b' and 'c' after the a's.\n\nAlternatively, we can split the string into groups of consecutive same characters.\n\nLike, for 'aaabccc', the groups are ['aaa', 'b', 'ccc'].\n\nSimilarly, for 'aabc', the groups are ['aa', 'b', 'c'].\n\nSo, the idea is that the groups must be exactly three, and they must be in the order a, b, c.\n\nIf the groups have more than three elements, or are not in that order, then it's invalid.\n\nSo, first, I can split the string into runs, then check:\n\n- The runs are exactly three in number.\n\n- The first run is 'a's.\n\n- The second is 'b's.\n\n- The third is 'c's.\n\nIf any of these conditions fail, the string is invalid.\n\nAlso, each run must have at least one character.\n\nSo, for example, 'a' followed by 'b' followed by 'c' is valid.\n\nAnother example: 'abbbc' is valid.\n\nNow, what about cases where the runs are not in order?\n\nLike 'abbaccc'—no, because the runs would be a, b, a, c, which is four runs, so invalid.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaaccc'—the runs are aa, bb, aa, ccc. So four runs, invalid.\n\nSo, the first condition is that the runs are exactly three, and in order a → b → c.\n\nIf that's not the case, output NO.\n\nOnce that's confirmed, the next step is to check whether the count of 'c's is equal to the count of 'a's or 'b's.\n\nBecause C appends some c's equal to the number of a's or b's.\n\nWait, the number of c's must be equal to either the number of a's or the number of b's.\n\nSo, count_c = count_a or count_c = count_b.\n\nSo, after ensuring the structure is correct, I need to compute the counts.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Split the string into runs of a, b, c.\n\n   - Check that there are exactly three runs.\n\n   - The first is a's, second b's, third c's.\n\n   - Each run has at least one character.\n\n   If any of these is false, return NO.\n\n2. Compute count_a = len(run1), count_b = len(run2), count_c = len(run3).\n\n3. Check if count_c equals count_a OR count_c equals count_b.\n\n   If yes, return YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the initial string after B appends has at least one a and one b. Then C appends some c's, which could be zero? No, because the problem says C appends some number of letters 'c's. So, C must append at least one 'c'? Or can it be zero? Wait, the problem says \"appends some number of letters 'c' to the end\". But in the note, it says that the string after B appending has at least one a and one b.\n\nThen C appends some 'c's. So, the number of 'c's added by C can be zero? Or is it required to be at least one?\n\nLooking back: the problem says, \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\" So, some number implies at least one, right? Or does \"some\" allow zero? Hmm, in English, 'some' often means at least one, but sometimes it's interpreted as including zero. Wait, but in the problem's note, the first example has at least one c.\n\nWait, the note says that in the first example, the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's. So the 'c's count is 3, and 'a's are 3.\n\nIn the problem statement, after C appends, the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'—but it doesn't say anything about 'c's. So, perhaps the count of 'c's can be zero? Or is it required to be at least one?\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says C appends \"some number of 'c's\". So, the number can be zero or more. But then, the string must have at least one a, one b, and possibly zero c's. But wait, the problem statement says that the string after C's appending will have all three a, b, c? Or not necessarily?\n\nWait, re-reading the problem statement:\n\n\"A has a string consisting of some number of lowercase letters 'a'. He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.\"\n\nSo, after B's step, the string has at least one a and one b.\n\nThen, C appends some number of 'c's. So, the string now has the a's, b's, and some c's. But the problem doesn't state that the c's count must be at least one. So, it's possible that C appends zero c's. But wait, that would leave the string as the a's followed by b's. But the problem says that the string is passed to C, who appends some 'c's. So, perhaps C can choose to add zero 'c's.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says that C appends some number of 'c's. So, the number is ≥0.\n\nBut then, in the output, the string may have zero 'c's. However, the problem says that after B appends, the string has at least one a and one b. So, the final string after C has at least one a and one b, but perhaps zero c's.\n\nBut the problem requires that the string is constructed as per A, B, C's actions. So, in that case, the string can have zero 'c's only if C chose to append zero.\n\nBut wait, the note says that in the second example, the order is wrong. So, the string can have c's, but their count is allowed as per the rules.\n\nWait, but the problem requires the entire string to be in the form a^+ b^+ c^+ ?\n\nNo, because C can choose to append zero. So, the string could have zero c's. But in that case, the string would be a^+b^+.\n\nWait, but in that case, the problem says that after C's step, the string is a^+b^+c^+ (if C adds some c's). Or could it be a^+b^+ (if C adds zero)?\n\nI think the problem allows C to add zero c's, making the string a^+b^+.\n\nSo, the string can have any number of c's, including zero, as long as it's equal to a's or b's count.\n\nWait, no. Because in the problem statement, when C appends, he appends some number of 'c's. So, the count is >=0.\n\nSo, the string can have zero 'c's, but then the condition is that the count_c (which is zero) must equal count_a or count_b.\n\nBut since count_a and count_b are at least 1, count_c being zero can't equal them. So, in that case, the string would be invalid.\n\nWait, let's take an example: suppose the string is 'ab'.\n\nAfter A and B, the string is 'ab'. Then C appends zero c's. So the final string is 'ab'.\n\nSo, the counts are a=1, b=1, c=0.\n\nThen, the count_c (0) must equal a or b, which are both 1. So 0 != 1, so this would be invalid.\n\nSo, such a string would not be acceptable.\n\nSo, the string must have at least one c.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that C appends some number of c's, which includes zero. So, the count can be zero. But then, the condition is that count_c must equal a or b, which are both positive. So, if count_c is zero, then it cannot equal a or b. Hence, the overall string is invalid.\n\nSo, the string must have at least one c.\n\nSo, the runs must be a, b, c, each run having at least one character.\n\nSo, the string must have at least one a, one b, and one c.\n\nSo, in our code, we must ensure that the runs are a, b, c, each run having at least one character.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Split the string into runs of same characters.\n\n2. Check that the runs are exactly three, in the order a, b, c.\n\n3. Each run has at least one character.\n\nIf any of these is not satisfied, output NO.\n\nElse, calculate count_a, count_b, count_c.\n\nCheck if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nIf yes, output YES. Else, NO.\n\nSo, now, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, to split the string into runs.\n\nWe can loop through the string, keeping track of the current character and the current run.\n\nInitialize current_char as the first character, current_run as [current_char].\n\nThen, for each subsequent character in the string:\n\n   if it's the same as current_char, add to current_run.\n\n   else, add current_run to the runs list, reset current_char and current_run.\n\nAfter the loop, add the last current_run to runs.\n\nOnce we have the runs list, we can check:\n\n- len(runs) == 3.\n\n- runs[0][0] == 'a'\n\n- runs[1][0] == 'b'\n\n- runs[2][0] == 'c'\n\nEach run's length is at least 1.\n\nIf all these are true, proceed.\n\nElse, output NO.\n\nOnce the structure is correct, compute counts.\n\ncount_a = len(runs[0])\n\ncount_b = len(runs[1])\n\ncount_c = len(runs[2])\n\nCheck if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nIf yes, output YES; else, NO.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: All three runs are present, but count_c is neither a nor b.\n\nE.g., 'aabbbccccc' → a=2, b=3, c=5 → 5≠2 and 5≠3 → NO.\n\nCase 2: Correct structure, but count_c is equal to a or b.\n\nE.g., 'aaabbbc' → a=3, b=3, c=1 → c=1 is not equal to a or b. So, NO.\n\nWait, no: a=3, b=3, c=1. So, c is 1, which is not equal to a or b. So, it's invalid.\n\nAnother example: 'aaabbbccc' → a=3, b=3, c=3 → c equals both a and b. So, YES.\n\nWhat about a string like 'abbaaccc' → the runs are a, b, a, c, c, c. So, len(runs) is 4, so structure is invalid → output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'a' → len(runs) is 1 → invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → runs are a, b, c. Each run has 1. So, count_c is 1, which equals a and b. So, output YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'abbbc' → runs are a, b, c. a=1, b=3, c=1. So, c is 1, which equals a. So, YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaabbbccc' → a=3, b=3, c=3 → c equals both, so YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaacc' → runs are a, b, a, a, c → len(runs) is 4, so invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaa' → runs are a, b, a → len 3, but third run is a, so invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'abba' → runs are a, b, a → invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'abbb' → runs are a, b, b, b. Wait, no: the runs are a, b (since all the rest are b). So, len(runs) is 2. So, invalid.\n\nWait, no, in 'abbb', the runs are a, then b. So, len(runs) is 2. So, structure is invalid.\n\nSo, code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nRead the input string S.\n\nProcess S into runs.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nif len(s) < 3:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # process runs\n    runs = []\n    current_char = s[0]\n    current_count = 1\n    for c in s[1:]:\n        if c == current_char:\n            current_count +=1\n        else:\n            runs.append( (current_char, current_count) )\n            current_char = c\n            current_count = 1\n    runs.append( (current_char, current_count) )\n\n    # check runs\n    if len(runs) != 3:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        # check the characters in order\n        expected_chars = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n        for i in range(3):\n            if runs[i][0] != expected_chars[i]:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit()\n        # also, each run must have at least 1\n        if runs[0][1] <1 or runs[1][1]<1 or runs[2][1]<1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            # compute counts\n            a = runs[0][1]\n            b = runs[1][1]\n            c = runs[2][1]\n            if c == a or c == b:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in the code above, I have to make sure that the runs are a, then b, then c.\n\nSo, the code checks each run's character against the expected list.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc'\n\nRuns: a:3, b:1, c:3 → structure OK.\n\nc =3 == a's count 3 → YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → the string is 'bba cc' → runs are b:2, a:1, c:2. So len(runs) is 3, but the order is b,a,c → invalid → output NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → runs are a:2, b:1, c:1. c=1, which is equal to b's count (1). So YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'abba' → runs are a:1, b:2, a:1 → len(runs)=3, but the third run is a, which is invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → a:1, b:1, c:1 → c equals a and b. So YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbbc' → a:2, b:3, c:1 → c=1 ≠ a or b → NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaabbbbcccc' → a:4, b:4, c:4 → c=4 equals a and b → YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaabbbccc' → runs are a, b, a, a, b, c → len(runs)=5 → invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaaccc' → runs are a:2, b:2, a:2, c:3 → len(runs)=4 → invalid.\n\nSo, the code should handle these correctly.\n\nWait, but what about a string with only a's, like 'aaaa'? Then, runs is [('a',4)], len=1 <3 → NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbcca' → the string ends with 'a's. So runs are a:2, b:2, c:2, a:1 → len(runs)=4 → invalid.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nWait, but in the code, I have to handle empty strings? Well, the problem states that the input string is at least length 1.\n\nBut for len(s) <3, the code will immediately output NO.\n\nBut what about when len(s) is exactly 3, like 'abc'? That's allowed.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'ab' → len=2 → NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcabc' → runs are a:1, b:1, c:1, a:1, b:1, c:1 → len=6 → invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'abba' → runs are a, b, a → len=3, but third run is a → invalid.\n\nNow, what about 'aabbaaccc' → the runs are a:2, b:2, a:2, c:3 → len=4 → invalid.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo, the code looks solid.\n\nWait, but in the code, for the runs, we have to collect the count as well. So, the code builds a list of tuples (char, count) for each run.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → runs are a:3, b:1, c:3 → structure OK. c=3 equals a=3 → YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → runs are b:2, a:1, c:2 → len=3. But the order is b,a,c → invalid → output NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → runs a:2, b:1, c:1 → structure OK. c=1 equals b=1 → YES.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by a specific sequence of operations involving the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The string must be constructed such that it starts with one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, and ends with one or more 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must equal the number of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Structure**: The string must be structured in the form of a sequence of 'a's, followed by 'b's, and ending with 'c's. This means the string should transition from 'a' to 'b' exactly once and then from 'b' to 'c' exactly once. There should not be any other transitions or interleaving characters.\n2. **Count Check**: After verifying the structure, we need to check if the count of 'c's is equal to either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's. This ensures that the number of 'c's appended by friend C meets the required condition.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\nif len(s) < 3:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    runs = []\n    current_char = s[0]\n    current_count = 1\n    for c in s[1:]:\n        if c == current_char:\n            current_count += 1\n        else:\n            runs.append((current_char, current_count))\n            current_char = c\n            current_count = 1\n    runs.append((current_char, current_count))\n\n    if len(runs) != 3:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        expected_chars = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(3):\n            if runs[i][0] != expected_chars[i]:\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if not valid:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if runs[0][1] < 1 or runs[1][1] < 1 or runs[2][1] < 1:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                a = runs[0][1]\n                b = runs[1][1]\n                c = runs[2][1]\n                if c == a or c == b:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Initial Check**: If the string length is less than 3, it immediately prints \"NO\" because it cannot meet the minimum required structure.\n3. **Splitting into Runs**: The string is processed into runs of consecutive identical characters. Each run is stored as a tuple containing the character and its count.\n4. **Structure Validation**: The runs are checked to ensure there are exactly three runs, each in the order 'a', 'b', 'c'. Each run must have at least one character.\n5. **Count Check**: The counts of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's are compared to ensure the number of 'c's matches either the number of 'a's or 'b's.
