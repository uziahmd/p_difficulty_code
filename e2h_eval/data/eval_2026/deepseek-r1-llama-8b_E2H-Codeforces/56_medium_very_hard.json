Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's from a competitive programming contest. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about assigning Rebel spaceships to guard B bases. We need to make sure that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base. So, essentially, we're looking for a perfect matching between R Rebels and B bases. But there's an additional constraint: any two paths from a base to its assigned spaceship shouldn't intersect. Oh right, the paths are straight lines in the galaxy plane, and they can't cross each other. \n\nSo, what's the approach here? Hmm. Let's think.\n\nFirst, the problem requires checking if a bipartite matching exists where the edges don't create any intersecting paths. Wait, but how do I model this? Because the condition about the paths not intersecting seems to relate to the way the lines are drawn.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that the matching should be such that no two edges (which are the lines connecting a spaceship to a base) cross each other. So, the problem reduces to finding a perfect matching in a bipartite graph where the edges are non-crossing.\n\nBut how do I represent this in code? It's a bit tricky because the graph isn't static—it depends on the positions of the points.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the approach is to generate all possible perfect matchings and check for each whether the corresponding edges are non-crossing.\n\nBut wait, the number of possible matchings could be large, especially since R and B can be up to 10 each. For example, if R=5 and B=5, the number of perfect matchings is 5! = 120, which is manageable. But when both R and B are 10, the number becomes 10! = 3,628,800. That's a lot, but maybe manageable with some optimizations.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Read the input: R, B, then R points for the spaceships, followed by B points for the bases.\n2. Generate all possible perfect matchings between the spaceships and bases.\n3. For each matching, check if all the connecting lines are non-crossing.\n4. If any matching satisfies the condition, output \"Yes\"; otherwise, output \"No\".\n\nBut how do I efficiently check if the lines in a matching are non-crossing?\n\nLet me think about the properties of the lines. Each line connects a spaceship to a base. So, for a given matching, the lines are from s_1 to b_1, s_2 to b_2, etc. We need to ensure that none of these lines cross each other.\n\nWait, but how do two lines cross? Two lines in a plane cross if their endpoints are interleaved. So, for two lines s_i -> b_j and s_k -> b_l, they cross if the points are ordered in a way that s_i is between s_k and b_l, etc. Or perhaps more formally, the lines cross if the points are arranged in a certain way.\n\nI remember that for two segments (a, b) and (c, d), they cross if the points are ordered as a, c, b, d along the x-axis, or similar in y when projected. So, perhaps for all pairs of lines in the matching, I need to check whether they cross. If any pair does, the matching is invalid.\n\nBut checking all pairs for each matching might be computationally expensive, especially for larger numbers of edges. However, since R and B are up to 10, the maximum number of edges in a matching is 10, which means checking C(10,2)=45 pairs per matching. And with 10! = 3.6 million matchings, that's 3.6e6 * 45 = around 162 million operations. Hmm, that's a lot, but perhaps manageable in Python.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to check for crossing without having to compare every pair. Maybe by sorting the lines in some order and ensuring that no two cross after the sort.\n\nWait, if we represent each line as a pair of points, and then sort them in a particular way, perhaps using some kind of sweep line algorithm, we can find if any two lines cross. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for a given matching, the lines must be non-crossing, which implies that the order of the points along the x-axis is such that the lines don't cross. So perhaps, for the lines in the matching, their endpoints must form a convex polygon or something similar.\n\nWait, maybe the way to ensure that all lines are non-crossing is to arrange the matching in such a way that the lines can be drawn without any crossings. One way to do this is to sort the lines based on their x-coordinates and check for monotonicity in the y-coordinates.\n\nAnother thought: the lines can be considered as edges in a planar graph. So, if the matching can form a planar embedding, then it's acceptable. But I'm not sure how to translate that into code.\n\nHmm. Let me try to outline the steps again.\n\nStep 1: Read input.\n\nWe have R spaceships and B bases. Each spaceship has (x, y) coordinates, same for bases.\n\nStep 2: Generate all possible perfect matchings between spaceships and bases.\n\nA perfect matching is a bijection between R and B. So, for each spaceship, assign it to a unique base.\n\nBut wait, R and B may be different. Oh, wait, the problem says that R and B are the numbers of spaceships and bases respectively, and we have to assign exactly one spaceship to each base, and vice versa. So R must equal B for a perfect matching to exist. Oh, but wait, the first line says 1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10. So, the code needs to handle cases where R != B, but in that case, the answer is automatically \"No\" because a perfect matching is only possible if R = B.\n\nWait, yes! Because if R != B, then the number of spaceships and bases is different, so a perfect matching is impossible. So the first thing to check is whether R equals B. If not, output \"No\".\n\nWait, but the sample input shows R=3 and B=3. So, in the problem statement, the first example has R=3, B=3, which works. The second example has R=2, B=3, which is why the output is \"No\".\n\nSo, step 0: Check if R != B. If yes, output \"No\".\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nSo, that's an early exit condition.\n\nSo, now, assuming R == B, we need to generate all possible perfect matchings.\n\nEach matching is a permutation of the B bases assigned to the R spaceships.\n\nWait, no. Since both are of size R, it's a bijection between the spaceships and bases. So, for each spaceship (from 0 to R-1), assign it to a base (from 0 to B-1, but since B=R, it's 0 to R-1). So, it's a permutation of the bases.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample, there are 3 spaceships and 3 bases. So, each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, and all are used.\n\nNow, for each permutation (each possible assignment), we need to check whether the lines formed by the assignment are non-crossing.\n\nSo, the next step is to generate all permutations of the bases for the spaceships.\n\nIn Python, the itertools.permutations function can generate all possible permutations. So, for each permutation in itertools.permutations(bases, R), which would give us all possible bijections.\n\nBut wait, in our case, the spaceships are fixed, and the bases are fixed. So, for each permutation, we assign the i-th spaceship to the j-th base in the permutation.\n\nOnce a permutation is chosen, we can collect all the lines between spaceships and their assigned bases.\n\nThen, for each pair of lines in this set, we need to check if they cross.\n\nIf any pair of lines cross, the permutation is invalid, and we move on to the next permutation.\n\nIf a permutation is found where no lines cross, we can immediately return \"Yes\".\n\nOtherwise, after checking all permutations, if none are valid, return \"No\".\n\nSo, the core part is to implement a function that, given a list of lines (each line is a tuple of two points), checks whether any two lines cross.\n\nHow to implement this function.\n\nEach line is a segment between two points. So, for two segments (s1, b1) and (s2, b2), we need to determine if they intersect.\n\nBut wait, the lines are finite, so the segments are finite. So, two lines can cross either at their endpoints or somewhere along their infinite lines, but as segments, they may not actually cross.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that no three points are colinear, and no two points coincide. So, any two points are distinct, and any three points are not aligned. So, for any two segments, they can either cross or not.\n\nSo, how to check whether two segments cross.\n\nI remember that two line segments (a, b) and (c, d) cross if and only if the points are in a specific order that causes their lines to cross. \n\nThe standard way to check this is to compute the orientation of various points.\n\nThe orientation of three points p, q, r can tell us whether they are collinear (0), clockwise (1), or counterclockwise (-1).\n\nTo determine if two segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) cross, we can use the following method:\n\nCheck the four orientations:\n\n- Orientation of (p1, p2, q1)\n- Orientation of (p1, p2, q2)\n- Orientation of (q1, p2, q2)\n- Orientation of (q1, p2, q1)\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is better.\n\nAn alternative method is to represent each segment as two points, and then check if the two segments intersect in any way.\n\nHere's a function I found before that determines if two segments AB and CD intersect:\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(A,B,C,D):\n    ccw1 = ccw(A,C,B)\n    ccw2 = ccw(A,D,B)\n    ccw3 = ccw(C,A,D)\n    ccw4 = ccw(C,B,D)\n    # If the points are colinear and the segments overlap, it's considered as intersecting.\n    # But according to the problem statement, no three points are colinear, so this case won't occur.\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n    # Also, check if a point lies on the other segment.\n    # For example, if C is on AB.\n    # But since no three points are colinear, this can't happen.\n    # Wait, no, because the segments are finite. So, even if C is on the line AB, but not on the segment AB, it's not considered as intersection.\n    # So, perhaps the above function is sufficient for our purposes.\n    return False\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.\n\nThe function ccw gives the direction of the turn from A to B to C. If the result is positive, it's counterclockwise; if negative, clockwise; zero, colinear.\n\nSo, for two segments AB and CD to cross, the points must be arranged such that one is inside the other's segment in a way that their turns alternate.\n\nWait, the condition (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0) indicates that the points are arranged in such a way that the segments cross each other.\n\nSo, perhaps this function is correct.\n\nBut considering that in our problem, no three points are colinear, so the function will correctly return false in cases where the segments don't cross, and true when they do.\n\nSo, in the code, for each pair of segments in a matching, we need to check if any pair crosses. If any pair does, the matching is invalid.\n\nSo, the steps for each permutation:\n\n- Assign each spaceship to a base via the permutation.\n- For each pair of edges (spaceship i to base j, and spaceship k to base l), check if the two segments cross.\n- If any pair crosses, discard this permutation.\n- If all pairs are non-crossing, then return \"Yes\".\n\nSo, now the plan is clear.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nFirst, read R and B. If R != B, output \"No\" and exit.\n\nElse, read R spaceship points and B base points.\n\nGenerate all possible permutations of the B bases. For each permutation, assign each spaceship to the corresponding base.\n\nFor each such assignment, collect the segments (spaceship, base) as a list.\n\nThen, for all i < j in the list of segments, check if they cross using the ccw function.\n\nIf any pair crosses, skip to the next permutation.\n\nIf none cross, output \"Yes\".\n\nIf all permutations are checked and none work, output \"No\".\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nWe can write a helper function called segments_cross(a, b, c, d) which returns True if the two segments AB and CD cross.\n\nImplementing that is crucial.\n\nAlso, since R and B can be up to 10, the maximum number of segments per matching is 10, and the number of pairs is 45. So for each permutation, the checking is O(45) operations.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B, print 'No' and exit.\n\nRead R spaceship coordinates as a list of tuples.\n\nRead B base coordinates as a list of tuples.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the bases list.\n\nFor each permutation in itertools.permutations(bases):\n\n   create a list of segments, each being (spaceship[i], base[j][i]) ?\n\nWait, no. For each permutation, the ith spaceship is assigned to the jth base in the permutation.\n\nWait, the permutation is a tuple where the first element is the base assigned to the first spaceship, the second is for the second, etc.\n\nSo, for spaceship i, the assigned base is permutation[i].\n\nSo, the segments are [ (spaceships[i], bases[perm[i]]) for i in 0..R-1 ]\n\nOnce we have this list of segments, check all possible pairs.\n\nFor each pair of segments s1 and s2:\n\n   get their four endpoints: s1_p1, s1_p2, s2_p1, s2_p2.\n\n   if segments_intersect(s1_p1, s1_p2, s2_p1, s2_p2) is True, then this permutation is invalid.\n\nIf any pair returns True, break and try next permutation.\n\nIf all pairs are checked and none cross, then output 'Yes' and terminate.\n\nIf after all permutations, no valid one is found, output 'No'.\n\nNow, implementing the segments_intersect function.\n\nLet me write the ccw function and the segments_intersect function.\n\nBut wait, in the function, the points are given as tuples (x, y). So, the function can be written as:\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0] - A[0]) * (C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1]) * (C[0] - A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    # Check if AB and CD cross.\n    # Compute orientations.\n    ccw1 = ccw(A, C, B)\n    ccw2 = ccw(A, D, B)\n    ccw3 = ccw(C, A, D)\n    ccw4 = ccw(C, B, D)\n\n    # General case: the segments cross.\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n    # Special case: one of the endpoints is on the other segment.\n    # But according to the problem statement, no three points are colinear, so this can't happen.\n    return False\n\nWait, but wait: in the problem statement, it's stated that no three points are on the same line. So, any two points define a unique line, and no third point is on that line. So, this function correctly returns whether two segments cross.\n\nSo, the function is correct.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\nSpaceships:\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nBases:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo, R=3, B=3.\n\nPermutation 0: base 0, base 1, base 2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the permutation is a tuple of the bases assigned to the spaceships in order.\n\nSo, the first spaceship (0,0) is assigned to the first base in the permutation.\n\nWait, but the order in the permutation is determined by the way the bases are read. So, in the sample input, the bases are given in the order:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo, in the sample input, the second part is:\n\n['2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the input. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line is R and B.\n\nThen, R lines follow, each with xi and yi, the spaceship coordinates.\n\nThen, B lines follow, each with xi and yi, the base coordinates.\n\nSo, in the first sample input, the spaceship coordinates are:\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nAnd the base coordinates are:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2.\n\nSo, the permutation would be the assignment of the three bases to the three spaceships.\n\nIn the sample explanation, one possible matching is:\n\nspaceship 1 (0,0) → base 0 (-2,1)\n\nspaceship 2 (2,0) → base 1 (0,3)\n\nspaceship 3 (3,1) → base 2 (2,2)\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Wait, the sample says:\n\n\"For the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.\"\n\nWait, the order is probably the order of the spaceships and bases as given.\n\nWait, perhaps the first spaceship is connected to the first base, the second to the second, etc.\n\nBut in that case, the first spaceship is (0,0) connected to (-2,1), the second to (0,3), the third to (2,2).\n\nDo these lines cross?\n\nWell, let's see.\n\nLine 1: (0,0) to (-2,1).\n\nLine 2: (2,0) to (0,3).\n\nLine 3: (3,1) to (2,2).\n\nCheck all pairs.\n\nCheck line 1 and line 2.\n\nCompute if they cross.\n\nUsing the function:\n\nA = (0,0), B=(-2,1), C=(2,0), D=(0,3).\n\nCompute ccw(A, C, B):\n\nC is (2,0), A is (0,0), B is (-2,1).\n\nccw(A, C, B) = (2-0)*(1-0) - (0-0)*(2-0) → 2*1 - 0*2 = 2.\n\nccw(A, D, B): D is (0,3), so (0-0)*(3-0) - (3-0)*(0-0) → 0*3 -3*0 = 0.\n\nWait, but D is (0,3), so for line AB: A is (0,0), B is (-2,1).\n\nCompute ccw(A, D, B): points A, D, B.\n\nD is (0,3), so:\n\n(B.x - A.x) = -2, (B.y - A.y) = 1.\n\nD.x - A.x = 0, D.y - A.y = 3.\n\nSo, (B.x - A.x) * (D.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(D.x - A.x) → (-2)*3 - (1)*0 → -6.\n\nSo, ccw1 = 2, ccw2 = -6.\n\nTheir product is 2*(-6) = -12 < 0. So, the first condition is satisfied.\n\nThen, compute ccw3 and ccw4.\n\nccw3 is ccw(C, A, D): C is (2,0), A is (0,0), D is (0,3).\n\n(B.x - A.x) = 0-2 = -2, (B.y - A.y) = 3-0=3.\n\nWait, no, the function is ccw(C, A, D).\n\nSo, points C, A, D.\n\nCompute (A.x - C.x) * (D.y - C.y) - (A.y - C.y) * (D.x - C.x).\n\nA is (0,0), C is (2,0), D is (0,3).\n\n(A.x - C.x) = -2, (A.y - C.y) = 0.\n\n(D.y - C.y) = 3, (D.x - C.x) = -2.\n\nSo, (-2)*3 - 0*(-2) = -6 - 0 = -6.\n\nccw3 = -6.\n\nccw4 is ccw(C, B, D): C is (2,0), B is (-2,1), D is (0,3).\n\n(B.x - C.x) = -4, (B.y - C.y) = 1.\n\n(D.x - C.x) = -2, (D.y - C.y) = 3.\n\nSo, (-4)*3 - 1*(-2) = -12 + 2 = -10.\n\nSo, ccw3 is -6, ccw4 is -10. Their product is (-6)*(-10) =60>0. So, the second condition is not met.\n\nThus, the segments AB and CD do not cross.\n\nWait, but according to the function, the first condition is (ccw1 * ccw2 <0) → yes, but the second condition is (ccw3 * ccw4 <0) → no, because 60 is positive.\n\nSo, the function returns false, meaning the segments do not cross.\n\nSo, this permutation is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, in reality, the lines from (0,0) to (-2,1) and (2,0) to (0,3) do cross.\n\nWait, perhaps my function is incorrect. Hmm.\n\nLet me plot the points.\n\nLine 1: (0,0) to (-2,1).\n\nLine 2: (2,0) to (0,3).\n\nDo these two lines cross?\n\nAt (0,0) and (-2,1), the line is going from (0,0) to left and up.\n\nAt (2,0) and (0,3), the line goes from (2,0) to (0,3), which is a diagonal line.\n\nThese two lines should cross.\n\nWait, but according to the function, segments_intersect returns false.\n\nHmm, that suggests that the function is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me recalculate the ccw values.\n\nFor the two segments AB and CD, where A=(0,0), B=(-2,1), C=(2,0), D=(0,3).\n\nCompute ccw1 = ccw(A, C, B): A is (0,0), C is (2,0), B is (-2,1).\n\nSo, vectors AC and CB.\n\nAC is (2,0), CB is (-4,1).\n\nWait, the function is (B.x - A.x)*(C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(C.x - A.x).\n\nSo, ( (-2) - 0 ) * (0 - 0 ) - (1 - 0) * (2 - 0 )\n\n→ (-2)*0 - 1*2 = 0 -2 = -2.\n\nSo, ccw1 is -2.\n\nccw2 = ccw(A, D, B): D is (0,3).\n\nVectors AD = (0,3), DB = (-2, -2).\n\nWait, the function is (D.x - A.x)*(B.y - A.y) - (D.y - A.y)*(B.x - A.x).\n\nWait, no, wait: the function is ccw(A, D, B).\n\nWhich is (D.x - A.x) * (B.y - A.y) - (D.y - A.y) * (B.x - A.x).\n\nSo, (0-0)*(1-0) - (3-0)*(-2 - 0) → 0*1 -3*(-2) → 0 +6 =6.\n\nSo, ccw2 is 6.\n\nSo, ccw1 * ccw2 is (-2)*6 = -12 <0. So, first condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, compute ccw3 = ccw(C, A, D).\n\nC is (2,0), A is (0,0), D is (0,3).\n\nVectors CA = (-2, 0), DA = (-2,3).\n\nWait, the function is ccw(C, A, D): (A.x - C.x) * (D.y - C.y) - (A.y - C.y)*(D.x - C.x).\n\nSo, (0-2)*(3-0) - (0-0)*(0-2) → (-2)*3 - 0*(-2) → -6.\n\nSo, ccw3 is -6.\n\nccw4 is ccw(C, B, D): C is (2,0), B is (-2,1), D is (0,3).\n\nCompute (B.x - C.x)*(D.y - C.y) - (B.y - C.y)*(D.x - C.x).\n\nSo, (-2-2)*(3-0) - (1-0)*(0-2) → (-4)*3 - 1*(-2) → -12 +2 = -10.\n\nSo, ccw4 is -10.\n\nSo, ccw3 * ccw4 is (-6)*(-10) = 60 > 0. So, the second condition is not met.\n\nThus, the function returns False, meaning the segments do not cross.\n\nBut wait, in reality, the lines do cross. So, the function is incorrect.\n\nHmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the function is correct, but I'm miscalculating the segments.\n\nWait, what's the actual scenario.\n\nSegment AB is from (0,0) to (-2,1). Segment CD is from (2,0) to (0,3).\n\nDo these two segments cross?\n\nYes, they do.\n\nBecause the line AB is a line going from (0,0) to the left and up, while the line CD is a line from (2,0) to (0,3), which is a diagonal line. They cross somewhere in the middle.\n\nSo, the function should return True.\n\nBut according to the function, it returns False. So, there's a bug in the function.\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nWait, perhaps the function is missing some cases.\n\nWait, let me think about the definition of segments_intersect. It's supposed to return True if the two line segments intersect.\n\nAnother approach: compute the intersection point of the two lines and check if it lies within both segments.\n\nBut that's computationally more expensive, but perhaps more accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is incorrect because it's not handling all cases where the segments cross.\n\nWait, perhaps the function should also consider the case where a point is on the other segment.\n\nBut the problem states that no three points are colinear, so that can't happen.\n\nWait, perhaps the function's condition is not sufficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the function should return True if any of the four conditions (ccw products) is negative, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps the function should return True if the two segments cross, which can happen in two cases:\n\nEither:\n\n1. The segments cross each other in the general case (the first condition is met).\n\nOR\n\n2. One of the endpoints is on the other segment.\n\nBut since the problem says no three points are colinear, this case can't happen. So, perhaps the function is correct.\n\nBut then why in the test case, the function returns False when the segments do cross.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is correct, but I'm making a mistake in the way I'm calling it.\n\nWait, in the function, the parameters are A, B, C, D. So, in the code, when checking two segments, the order is important.\n\nWait, in the sample case, the two segments are AB and CD.\n\nBut in the function, when calling segments_intersect(A, B, C, D), it's checking if AB and CD cross.\n\nWait, but perhaps the order is not correct. Maybe the function is intended to check if AB and CD cross, but perhaps the way it's implemented is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should be called as segments_intersect(A, B, C, D) and as segments_intersect(C, D, A, B), but that seems redundant.\n\nWait, perhaps I should swap the order of the points in the function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is correct, but I'm misapplying it.\n\nWait, let's recompute the function.\n\nIn the sample case, the two segments are AB: from (0,0) to (-2,1), and CD: from (2,0) to (0,3).\n\nSo, A is (0,0), B is (-2,1), C is (2,0), D is (0,3).\n\nCompute the four ccw values:\n\nccw1 = ccw(A, C, B) → points (0,0), (2,0), (-2,1).\n\nWait, wait, no. The function is ccw(A, C, B), which is the orientation of points A, C, B.\n\nSo, (A.x, A.y) = (0,0), (C.x, C.y)=(2,0), (B.x, B.y)=(-2,1).\n\nThe vector AC is (2,0), CB is (-4,1).\n\nThe cross product is (2)(1) - (0)(-4) = 2 +0=2.\n\nWait, wait, no, the cross product is calculated as (B.x - A.x)*(C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(C.x - A.x).\n\nSo, for points A, C, B:\n\n(B.x - A.x) is (-2 -0) = -2.\n\n(C.y - A.y) is 0-0=0.\n\n(B.y - A.y) is 1-0=1.\n\n(C.x - A.x) is 2-0=2.\n\nSo, cross product is (-2)*0 - 1*2 = 0 -2 = -2.\n\nSo, ccw1 is -2.\n\nccw2 is ccw(A, D, B).\n\nPoints A, D, B: (0,0), (0,3), (-2,1).\n\nVectors AD is (0,3), DB is (-2, -2).\n\nCross product is (D.x - A.x)*(B.y - A.y) - (D.y - A.y)*(B.x - A.x).\n\nSo, (0-0)*(1-0) - (3-0)*(-2-0) → 0*1 -3*(-2) → 0+6=6.\n\nSo, ccw2 is 6.\n\nccw1 * ccw2 is (-2)*6 = -12 <0.\n\nSo, condition 1 is satisfied.\n\nNow, condition 2: ccw3 * ccw4 <0.\n\nccw3 is ccw(C, A, D).\n\nPoints C, A, D: (2,0), (0,0), (0,3).\n\nVectors CA is (-2,0), DA is (-2,3).\n\nCross product is (A.x - C.x)*(D.y - C.y) - (A.y - C.y)*(D.x - C.x).\n\n(0-2)*(3-0) - (0-0)*(0-2) → (-2)*3 - 0*(-2) = -6.\n\nccw3 is -6.\n\nccw4 is ccw(C, B, D): points C, B, D.\n\nC is (2,0), B is (-2,1), D is (0,3).\n\nVectors CB is (-4,1), DB is (-2,2).\n\nWait, no. The function is ccw(C, B, D) → (B.x - C.x)*(D.y - C.y) - (B.y - C.y)*(D.x - C.x).\n\nSo, (-2-2)*(3-0) - (1-0)*(0-2) → (-4)*3 - 1*(-2) → -12 +2 = -10.\n\nSo, ccw4 is -10.\n\nSo, ccw3 * ccw4 is (-6)*(-10) =60>0.\n\nThus, condition 2 is not met.\n\nSo, the function returns False.\n\nBut the lines do cross. So, the function is not detecting this case.\n\nHmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the function is incorrect because it doesn't account for all cases where two segments cross.\n\nAlternative approach: use the line-line intersection and check if the intersection point is within the segments.\n\nThis is more computationally expensive, but perhaps necessary.\n\nSo, the steps for the function could be:\n\nFor two segments AB and CD:\n\n1. Find the intersection point of lines AB and CD.\n\n2. Check if this point lies within both segments AB and CD.\n\nIf yes, return True.\n\nElse, return False.\n\nBut how to compute the intersection.\n\nThe parametric equations for the lines can be used.\n\nLine AB can be represented as A + t*(B - A), t ∈ [0,1].\n\nLine CD can be represented as C + s*(D - C), s ∈ [0,1].\n\nSolve for t and s.\n\nIf t and s are between 0 and 1, the lines intersect within the segments.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCompute the denominator: det = (B.x - A.x)*(D.y - C.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(D.x - C.x).\n\nIf det is zero, the lines are parallel; no intersection.\n\nElse, compute t = ((C.x - A.x)*(D.y - C.y) - (C.y - A.y)*(D.x - C.x)) / det.\n\ns = ((C.x - A.x)*(B.y - A.y) - (C.y - A.y)*(B.x - A.x)) / det.\n\nIf t is between 0 and 1, and s is between 0 and 1, then the segments intersect.\n\nBut since the problem says that no three points are colinear, det is not zero, so no division by zero.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    # Line AB: A + t*(B-A)\n    # Line CD: C + s*(D-C)\n    # Compute denominator\n    denominator = (B[0] - A[0]) * (D[1] - C[1]) - (B[1] - A[1]) * (D[0] - C[0])\n    if denominator == 0:\n        return False  # parallel lines, no intersection\n    # Compute numerator for t and s\n    numerator_t = (C[0] - A[0]) * (D[1] - C[1]) - (C[1] - A[1]) * (D[0] - C[0])\n    numerator_s = (C[0] - A[0]) * (B[1] - A[1]) - (C[1] - A[1]) * (B[0] - A[0])\n    t = numerator_t / denominator\n    s = numerator_s / denominator\n    # Check if t and s are between 0 and 1\n    if 0 <= t <= 1 and 0 <= s <=1:\n        return True\n    return False\n\nWait, perhaps that's a better approach.\n\nSo, let's test this function with the sample case.\n\nSegments AB: (0,0) to (-2,1), and CD: (2,0) to (0,3).\n\nCompute denominator:\n\n(B.x - A.x) is (-2 -0) = -2.\n\n(D.y - C.y) is (3 -0) =3.\n\n(B.y - A.y) is 1-0=1.\n\n(D.x - C.x) is (0-2)= -2.\n\nSo, denominator = (-2)*3 - 1*(-2) = -6 +2 = -4.\n\nnumerator_t = (C.x - A.x)*(D.y - C.y) - (C.y - A.y)*(D.x - C.x).\n\nC.x - A.x is 2-0=2.\n\nD.y - C.y is 3-0=3.\n\nC.y - A.y is 0-0=0.\n\nD.x - C.x is 0-2=-2.\n\nSo, numerator_t = 2*3 -0*(-2) =6.\n\nt=6 / (-4) = -1.5.\n\ns is computed as (C.x - A.x)*(B.y - A.y) - (C.y - A.y)*(B.x - A.x).\n\nC.x - A.x is 2.\n\nB.y - A.y is 1.\n\nC.y - A.y is 0.\n\nB.x - A.x",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to assign Rebel spaceships to guard B bases such that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. Additionally, the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship must not intersect.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Perfect Matching**: First, we check if the number of spaceships (R) is equal to the number of bases (B). If they are not equal, it's impossible to have a perfect matching, so we immediately return \"No\".\n\n2. **Generate Permutations**: For each possible permutation of assigning spaceships to bases, we generate all possible bijections (perfect matchings).\n\n3. **Check for Non-Crossing Paths**: For each permutation, we create a list of segments representing the paths from each spaceship to its assigned base. We then check if any two segments in this list intersect. If any pair of segments intersects, this permutation is invalid.\n\n4. **Determine Result**: If any valid permutation (non-crossing paths) is found, we return \"Yes\".
