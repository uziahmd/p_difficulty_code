She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Luba is trying to close some tabs in her browser. Hmm, let me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo, the setup is that she has n tabs open, from 1 to n. The cursor starts at position pos. She needs to keep the tabs from l to r and close all others. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right, but only within the current available tabs. Or she can close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum number of seconds needed to achieve this.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. It seems like a problem that can be approached with BFS, because we're looking for the shortest path (minimum steps) to reach a certain state. Each state could represent the current position of the cursor and which tabs are still open. But wait, the state space might get too big if we track every possible subset of open tabs. So maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to figure out the order in which to close the tabs. Because once a tab is closed, it's gone forever, so the available tabs change. So each action affects the possible next moves.\n\nBut maybe instead of tracking the entire set of open tabs, we can model the state based on the current position and the range of open tabs. For example, when some tabs are closed, the available left and right boundaries change.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the initial state: all tabs are open. So the left boundary a is 1, and right boundary b is n. The cursor is at pos.\n\nEach step can be moving left, moving right, or closing left or right.\n\nSo, the possible actions from any state (current_pos, a, b) are:\n\n1. Move left: new_pos = max(current_pos - 1, a)\n   This takes 1 second.\n\n2. Move right: new_pos = min(current_pos + 1, b)\n   Also 1 second.\n\n3. Close left: This closes all tabs to the left of current_pos. So the new a becomes current_pos. This takes 1 second. But after this, the right boundary remains b, but wait, no—because if we close left, then the remaining tabs are from a to b, which after this operation would be a=current_pos. So the new a is current_pos, and the new b is still the same as before.\n\n4. Close right: Similarly, new b is current_pos. Takes 1 second.\n\nEach action transitions the state to a new (new_pos, new_a, new_b). We want to find the minimal steps to reach a state where the current a is l and the current b is r.\n\nWait, not exactly. Because the target is that the open tabs are exactly [l, r]. So the state after all operations should have a = l and b = r.\n\nSo our goal is to reach a state where a <= pos <= b, and a >= l, b <= r? Or wait, no. Because after closing, the a and b will be such that the only open tabs are those between a and b. So for the final state, a must be l and b must be r. Because any tabs outside [l, r] must have been closed.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the target state is a = l and b = r.\n\nSo, the initial state is a=1, b=n, current_pos=pos.\n\nWe need to find the minimal steps to reach a state where a=l and b=r, regardless of the current_pos (as long as it's within [a, b], since the cursor can't go beyond that).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimal steps to reach a state (a=l, b=r) starting from (a=1, b=n, current_pos=pos).\n\nNow, let's model this as a graph where each node is a tuple (a, b, pos), and edges represent the possible actions.\n\nWe can use BFS to explore all possible states, keeping track of visited states to avoid revisiting them and to find the shortest path.\n\nBut wait, what's the maximum possible value of a and b? Since l can be as low as 1 and r as high as n, a ranges from 1 to r, and b ranges from l to n.\n\nSo the total number of possible states is (r - l + 1) * (n - l + 1). For n up to 100, this is manageable, as 100*100=10^4, which is acceptable.\n\nBut let's see: for each a and b, the pos can be any value between a and b. So for each (a, b), there are (b - a + 1) possible positions.\n\nSo for n=100, a can be up to 100, b can be up to 100, but a <= b. So",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment [l, r] while keeping the tabs within that segment open. The solution involves using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible states efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Luba can move the cursor left or right and close tabs on either side. Each action takes one second. The goal is to reach a state where only the tabs from l to r remain open.\n2. **State Representation**: Each state is represented by a tuple `(a, b, pos)` where `a` is the leftmost open tab, `b` is the rightmost open tab, and `pos` is the current position of the cursor.\n3. **Initial State**: Start with all tabs open, i.e., `a = 1` and `b = n`, with the cursor at position `pos`.\n4. **Target State**: Reach `a = l` and `b = r`.\n5. **BFS Exploration**: Use BFS to explore all possible transitions from each state, considering moves and closing actions. Track visited states to avoid cycles and ensure the shortest path is found.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Directions: left, right, close left, close right\n    directions = [lambda a, b, pos: (max(pos - 1, a), b, pos),\n                  lambda a, b, pos: (a, min(pos + 1, b), pos),\n                  lambda a, b, pos: (a, b, pos),\n                  lambda a, b, pos: (a, b, pos)]\n    \n    visited = set()\n    queue = deque()\n    initial_a = 1\n    initial_b = n\n    queue.append((initial_a, initial_b, pos))\n    visited.add((initial_a, initial_b, pos))\n    \n    target_a = l\n    target_b = r\n    target_pos = None  # Doesn't matter as long as a and b are target\n    \n    steps = 0\n    answer = -1\n    \n    while queue:\n        for _ in range(len(queue)):\n            a, b, current_pos = queue.popleft()\n            \n            # Check if current state meets the target\n            if a == target_a and b == target_b:\n                answer = steps\n                break\n            \n            # Generate all possible next states\n            for move in directions:\n                new_a, new_b, new_pos = move(a, b, current_pos)\n                if (new_a, new_b, new_pos) not in visited:\n                    visited.add((new_a, new_b, new_pos))\n                    queue.append((new_a, new_b, new_pos))\n        \n        if answer != -1:\n            break\n        \n        steps += 1\n    \n    print(answer)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **BFS Initialization**: Start BFS from the initial state where all tabs are open (`a=1`, `b=n`) and the cursor is at position `pos`.\n- **State Transitions**: For each state, consider moving the cursor left or right, or closing tabs on either side. Each transition updates the state accordingly.\n- **Visited States**: Use a set to track visited states to avoid processing the same state multiple times.\n- **Termination Check**: If the target state is reached, record the number of steps taken and terminate early.\n\nThis approach ensures that we explore the shortest path first, guaranteeing the minimum number of seconds needed to achieve the desired state.",
