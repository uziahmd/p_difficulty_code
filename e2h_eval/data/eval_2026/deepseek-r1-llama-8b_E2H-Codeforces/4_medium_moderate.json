The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this Rock-Paper-Scissors problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that Nikephoros and Polycarpus are playing n rounds of rock-paper-scissors. In each round, they choose their move from their respective sequences A and B, cycling through them. If one wins, the loser gets a red spot. We need to count how many red spots each has after n rounds.\n\nHmm, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the input gives n, then two strings A and B. Each character is 'R', 'S', or 'P'. For each of the n rounds, we determine who wins based on their current choices. Then, increment the corresponding counter.\n\nWait, but how do we get their choices for each round? Because the sequences are cycled. So for each i-th round, the choice for Nikephoros is A[i % m], and similarly for Polycarpus as B[i % k], where m and k are the lengths of A and B respectively.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each round from 0 to n-1:\n   a. Get the move for N from A: a = A[i % len(A)]\n   b. Get the move for P from B: b = B[i % len(B)]\n   c. Determine the winner between a and b.\n   d. If N wins, P gets a spot. Else if P wins, N gets a spot. Else, no one gets a spot.\n   e. Increment the respective counters.\n\nBut wait, how to determine the winner?\n\nLet me think about the rules:\n\n- Rock beats scissors.\n- Scissors beat paper.\n- Paper beats rock.\n\nSo, for any two moves a and b, we can determine who wins.\n\nI need a function that, given a and b, returns whether a beats b, which would mean that the player with a wins, and the other loses.\n\nAlternatively, for each pair, compute who is the winner.\n\nLet me consider all possible cases:\n\nCase 1: a == b → draw, no points.\n\nCase 2: a beats b → N wins, P gets a spot.\n\nCase 3: b beats a → P wins, N gets a spot.\n\nSo, in code terms, for each round:\n\nif a == b: nothing.\n\nelse:\n\ncheck if a beats b:\n\nif yes → P adds 1.\n\nelse → N adds 1.\n\nSo, how to implement the condition where a beats b.\n\nLet's create a helper function or a dictionary that maps each move to what it beats.\n\nFor example:\n\nbeats = {\n    'R': 'S',\n    'S': 'P',\n    'P': 'R'\n}\n\nSo, if a beats b, then a is the winner.\n\nWait, because:\n\nIf a is R and b is S → R beats S → N wins.\n\nIf a is S and b is P → S beats P → N wins.\n\nIf a is P and b is R → P beats R → N wins.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for each round:\n\nget a and b.\n\nif a == b → no change.\n\nelse:\n\nif beats[a] == b → N wins, P gets a spot.\n\nelse → P wins, N gets a spot.\n\nWait, wait. No, wait. Wait, if a beats b, then a is N's move, so N wins. So in that case, P gets a spot.\n\nBut if b beats a, then P's move is winning, so N gets a spot.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the logic is:\n\nfor each round i (0-based):\n\na = A[i % m]\n\nb = B[i % k]\n\nif a == b: nothing.\n\nelse:\n\nif a beats b → P's spot +=1\n\nelse → N's spot +=1.\n\nSo, now the task is to process n rounds, each time getting the current a and b, and applying this logic.\n\nNow, considering constraints:\n\nn can be up to 2e5, which is manageable since each step is O(1).\n\nm and k can be up to 1000.\n\nSo, the approach is feasible.\n\nNow, the steps to code this:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nInitialize two counters, say, nike = 0, poly = 0.\n\nLoop for i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   a = A[i % m]\n\n   b = B[i % k]\n\n   if a == b: continue.\n\n   else:\n\n       if a beats b → poly +=1\n\n       else → nike +=1\n\nAfter processing all rounds, print nike and poly.\n\nWait, wait! Wait, no. Because in each round, the winner is the one whose move beats the other. So when a beats b, then the winner is a, which is N. So P loses, thus gets a spot. Similarly, if b beats a, then P wins, and N gets a spot.\n\nWait, no! Wait, when a is N's move, and b is P's.\n\nIf a beats b → N wins, so P gets a spot.\n\nIf b beats a → P wins, so N gets a spot.\n\nSo yes, the initial logic is correct.\n\nSo, for each round, check if a beats b.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to write code that directly checks whether a beats b.\n\nSo, using the helper function:\n\ndef beats(a, b):\n    return (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R')\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif a == b:\n\n   pass\n\nelse:\n\n   if beats(a, b):\n\n       poly +=1\n\n   else:\n\n       nike +=1\n\nSo, that's the plan.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n7\n\nA: RPS\n\nB: RSPP\n\nWait, no. The sample input is given as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, but in the note, the game went like this:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → P wins (since P beats R?), wait no, wait.\n\nWait, the note says:\n\nIn the first sample, the rounds are:\n\n1: R - R → draw.\n\n2: P - S → N loses.\n\n3: S - P → P loses.\n\n4: R - P → N loses.\n\n5: P - R → P loses.\n\n6: S - S → draw.\n\n7: R - P → N loses.\n\nWait, so the output is 3 (N has 3 losses) and 2 (P has 2).\n\nSo, let's see how our code would handle this.\n\nA is \"RPS\" → indices 0,1,2, then cycles.\n\nB is \"RSPP\" → indices 0,1,2,3, then cycles.\n\nn=7, so i from 0 to 6.\n\nLet's go through each round.\n\ni=0 (first round):\n\na = A[0] = 'R'\n\nb = B[0] = 'R' → same → no change.\n\ni=1:\n\na = A[1 %3=1] = 'P'\n\nb = B[1%4=1] = 'S'\n\nCheck if 'P' beats 'S'? Yes, because S is beaten by P. Wait no, wait:\n\nWait, 'P' is paper. What does paper beat? Paper beats Rock, right.\n\nSo, 'P' beats 'R'.\n\nIn this case, a is 'P' and b is 'S'. So 'P' doesn't beat 'S'. Because 'S' is beaten by 'R' and 'P' is beaten by 'S'?\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nRock beats Scissors.\n\nScissors beats Paper.\n\nPaper beats Rock.\n\nSo, for each move:\n\nR beats S.\n\nS beats P.\n\nP beats R.\n\nSo, in this case, a is 'P' and b is 'S'.\n\nDoes 'P' beat 'S'? No, because 'S' beats 'P'.\n\nSo, in this round, 'S' beats 'P', so P's move wins, so N gets a spot.\n\nSo, in the second round, N gets a spot.\n\nBut according to the sample note, in round 2, N loses. Oh right, because in the note, it's N's move and P's move.\n\nWait, let's re-express the sample:\n\nRound 2: P (from N) vs S (from P). So N's move is P, P's move is S.\n\nWho wins? S beats P. So P's move (S) beats N's (P). So P wins, so N gets a spot.\n\nWhich matches the note: N loses.\n\nYes, so the code correctly counts this.\n\nSo, in the code, for this round, a is 'P', b is 'S'.\n\na != b.\n\nCheck if a beats b: 'P' vs 'S' → 'P' is paper, 'S' is scissors. Does paper beat scissors? No, scissors cut paper. So 'S' beats 'P'.\n\nSo, beats(a,b) is False. So, in code, else clause is taken: N's spot increases by 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle it.\n\nAnother example: Round 3.\n\ni=2.\n\na=A[2%3=2] = 'S'.\n\nb=B[2%4=2] = 'P'.\n\nSo, a is 'S', b is 'P'.\n\nDoes S beat P? Yes. So N's move is S, which beats P. So N wins, P gets a spot.\n\nWhich matches the note: P loses.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A: the second line, stripping any leading/trailing whitespace.\n\nSame for B.\n\nThen, m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nInitialize counters.\n\nLoop i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   a = A[i % m]\n\n   b = B[i % k]\n\n   if a == b: continue.\n\n   else:\n\n       if a beats b → poly +=1\n\n       else → nike +=1\n\nAt end, print nike and poly.\n\nImplementing the 'beats' function.\n\nWait, in Python, functions inside loops can be slow, but since the number of rounds is up to 2e5, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, precompute a dictionary.\n\nSo, beats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\nSo, for a given a and b, a beats b if beats[a] == b.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, code in Python:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\n\nk = len(B)\n\nbeats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\nnike = 0\n\npoly = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        continue\n\n    if beats[a] == b:\n\n        poly +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        nike +=1\n\nprint(nike, poly)\n\nWait, let's test this code with the sample.\n\nSample Input:\n\nn=7\n\nA = 'RPS'\n\nB = 'RSPP'\n\nProcessing each i from 0 to 6.\n\ni=0:\n\na=R, b=R → same → no change.\n\ni=1:\n\na=P, b=S → beats[a]=S → yes, so b is S. So, a beats b? Yes. So poly +=1.\n\ni=2:\n\na=S, b=P → beats[S] is P → yes, so a beats b → poly +=1.\n\ni=3:\n\na=R, b= R again? No, B is 'RSPP', so at i=3, 3 mod 4 is 3 → b is 'P'.\n\nSo a=R, b=P → R beats S, but here, R vs P. R is beaten by P. So, beats[a] is S, which is not equal to b (P). So, else clause: nike +=1.\n\ni=4:\n\ni mod 3 is 1 → a=P.\n\ni mod4 is 0 → b=R.\n\nP vs R → P beats R. So a beats b → poly +=1.\n\ni=5:\n\ni mod3 is 2 → a=S.\n\ni mod4 is 1 → b=S → same → no change.\n\ni=6:\n\ni mod3 is 0 → a=R.\n\ni mod4 is 2 → b=P.\n\nR vs P → R is beaten by P. So, beats[R] is S, not equal to P → else clause: nike +=1.\n\nSo, let's tally the changes:\n\ni=1: poly +1 → poly=1.\n\ni=2: poly +1 → 2.\n\ni=3: nike +1 → 1.\n\ni=4: poly +1 → 3.\n\ni=6: nike +1 → 2.\n\nSo total:\n\nnike=2, poly=3.\n\nWait, but the sample output is 3 and 2.\n\nWait, wait, something's wrong.\n\nWait, in the sample note, the final counts are N has 3, P has 2.\n\nHmm, so maybe the code is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the logic in the code.\n\nLet me re-examine the sample step by step.\n\nIn the sample, the seven rounds are:\n\n1. R vs R → draw.\n\n2. P vs S → P's move (S) beats N's (P) → P wins → N gets a spot.\n\n3. S vs P → N's S beats P → N wins → P gets a spot.\n\n4. R vs P → P beats R → P wins → N gets a spot.\n\n5. P vs R → P beats R → P wins → N gets a spot.\n\n6. S vs S → draw.\n\n7. R vs P → P beats R → P wins → N gets a spot.\n\nSo, the total for N is 3 (rounds 2,4,7: N gets spots), and P gets 2 (rounds 3,5).\n\nWait, no. Wait, in each round, if N wins, P gets a spot. If P wins, N gets a spot.\n\nSo in the sample:\n\nRound 2: N's P vs P's S → P's S beats N's P → P wins → N gets a spot.\n\nRound3: N's S vs P's P → S beats P → N wins → P gets a spot.\n\nRound4: N's R vs P's P → R is beaten by P → P wins → N gets a spot.\n\nRound5: N's P vs P's R → P beats R → P wins → N gets a spot.\n\nRound7: N's R vs P's P → P wins → N gets a spot.\n\nSo, for N, he gets a spot in rounds 2,4,5,7? Or wait, let me recount:\n\nWait, no, let me list all 7 rounds:\n\nRound 1: R-R → no spots.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → S beats P → P wins → N gets spot (1).\n\nRound 3: S vs P → S beats P → N wins → P gets spot (1).\n\nRound4: R vs P → P beats R → P wins → N gets spot (2).\n\nRound5: P vs R → P beats R → P wins → N gets spot (3).\n\nRound6: S vs S → no spots.\n\nRound7: R vs P → P beats R → P wins → N gets spot (4).\n\nWait, so N has 4 spots, and P has 2.\n\nBut the sample output is 3 and 2.\n\nHmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, the sample note says:\n\nNikephoros has 3 losses, Polycarpus only 2.\n\nWait, perhaps in the sample, N has 3 red spots, meaning he lost 3 times.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nEach time N loses, he gets a spot.\n\nIn the sample, the rounds where N loses are:\n\nRound2: P vs S → P wins → N loses.\n\nRound4: R vs P → P wins → N loses.\n\nRound5: P vs R → P wins → N loses.\n\nRound7: R vs P → P wins → N loses.\n\nSo, that's 4 times N loses. But the sample note says he has 3.\n\nHmm, that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sample analysis.\n\nWait, the note says:\n\n\"In the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.\"\n\nSo, the sequence is:\n\n1. R-R: draw.\n\n2. P-S: N loses → P gets a spot.\n\n3. S-P: P loses → N gets a spot.\n\n4. R-P: N loses → P gets a spot.\n\n5. P-R: P loses → N gets a spot.\n\n6. S-S: draw.\n\n7. R-P: N loses → P gets a spot.\n\nWait, but in round 5, it's P vs R. P's move is P, R's is R.\n\nWait, wait: in round 5, N's move is P, P's is R.\n\nSo P's move is R, N's is P.\n\nWait, P's move is R, which beats P? No. Wait, R beats S.\n\nWait, P's move is R, which is paper? No, R is Rock.\n\nWait, sorry, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the moves:\n\nRound 5: N's move is P (from his sequence, A is RPS, so third round was S, fourth is R, fifth is P.\n\nP's move is B: RSPP. So for i=4 (0-based, fifth round?), i=4: 4 mod4=0 → B[0] is R.\n\nSo, N plays P, P plays R.\n\nSo, P's R vs N's P.\n\nR beats S, S beats P, P beats R.\n\nSo, R beats P → P's R beats N's P → P wins, N loses.\n\nSo, N gets a spot.\n\nWait, but in the sample note, round5 is P-R → Polycarpus loses.\n\nHmm, so according to the note, round5 is P's move R vs N's move P → P loses.\n\nWhich would imply that in that round, N's P beats P's R.\n\nBecause P's R is beaten by P's own P? No.\n\nWait, I'm getting myself mixed up.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the code.\n\nLet me see the code's calculation for the sample.\n\nIn the code, for each i from 0 to 6.\n\ni=0:\n\na='R', b='R' → same.\n\ni=1:\n\na='P', b='S' → a beats b? 'P' beats 'S'? No, 'S' beats 'P'. So 'P' is a, 'S' is b.\n\nSo, beats[a] is 'R' (since P beats R). So a's beats is R, which is not equal to b (S). So, else clause: N's spot +=1.\n\nSo, round 2: N gets a spot.\n\ni=2:\n\na='S', b='P' → a is S, which beats P. So, beats[a] is P, which equals b. So, poly +=1.\n\ni=3:\n\na='R', b='P' → a is R, which is beaten by P. So, beats[a] is S, which is not equal to b (P). So, else clause: N's spot +=1.\n\ni=4:\n\na='P', b='R' → a is P, which beats R. So, beats[a] is R, which is equal to b. So, poly +=1.\n\ni=5:\n\na='S', b='S' → same.\n\ni=6:\n\na='R', b='P' → a is R, which is beaten by P. So, beats[a] is S != P. Else clause: N's spot +=1.\n\nSo, the code counts:\n\nnike: 3 (i=1,3,6).\n\npoly: 2 (i=2,4).\n\nSo, the code outputs 3 2, which matches the sample.\n\nWait, but according to the note, the sample should have N with 3 spots, which is what the code outputs.\n\nSo, earlier confusion was due to a misinterpretation of the sample.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nI think that's solid.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they have played a series of rock-paper-scissors games. Each player follows a specific sequence of moves, and the loser of each round gets a red spot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game is played in rounds where each player uses their respective sequences cyclically. The winner of each round (based on the standard rock-paper-scissors rules) gives the loser a red spot. We need to count these red spots for both players after all rounds are completed.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each round, we determine the moves of both players using their sequences. Using the rules of the game, we check who wins the round. The loser gets a red spot. By iterating through each round and applying the game rules, we can keep track of the red spots.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Read the input values.\n   - Initialize counters for red spots.\n   - For each round, determine the moves of both players from their sequences.\n   - Check if one move beats the other using predefined rules.\n   - Update the counters based on who loses each round.\n   - Print the final counts of red spots.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently processes each round in constant time, making it suitable for the given constraints (up to 200,000 rounds).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\nbeats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\nnike = 0\npoly = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a = A[i % m]\n    b = B[i % k]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    if beats[a] == b:\n        poly += 1\n    else:\n        nike += 1\n\nprint(nike, poly)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds and the sequences used by each player.\n- **Cycle Through Sequences**: For each round, the moves are determined by cycling through the sequences using modulo operations.\n- **Determine Winner**: Using a dictionary to map each move to what it beats, we check if one move beats the other. If so, the corresponding player gets a red spot.\n- **Count Red Spots**: Based on the winner of each round, the appropriate counter is incremented.\n- **Output Result**: After processing all rounds, the counts of red spots for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and correctly count the red spots for both players, adhering to the game rules and constraints.",
