Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a plane with n infinite line roads. Each road is given by the equation a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0. These roads divide the plane into blocks. The home and university are in some blocks, not on any road. I need to find the minimal number of steps to get from home to university. A step is moving from one block to another if they share a border of non-zero length. So, moving through an intersection point doesn't count as a step because their shared boundary is just a point, which has zero length.\n\nHmm, so how do I model this? It feels like a graph problem where each block is a node, and edges represent possible moves between blocks via shared borders (non-zero length). But wait, the number of blocks could be very large, especially with many lines. So building such a graph directly isn't feasible.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think about what determines whether two points are in adjacent blocks. Each line divides the plane into two regions. The arrangement of these lines creates a series of regions.\n\nAn alternative approach: for each line, determine on which side of the line the home and university lie. Then, the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of lines that separate the home and university, i.e., lines where the home and university are on opposite sides. Because each such line would require a step to cross.\n\nOh right! Because each such separating line forms a boundary that you must cross. Each crossing reduces the number of overlapping lines you're in, but since each step can only cross one line at a time, the minimal steps would be the count of such lines.\n\nSo, the steps needed are equal to the number of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each of the n lines, compute whether the home and university are on the same side or opposite sides.\n2. Count the number of lines where they are on opposite sides.\n3. That count is the minimal number of steps required.\n\nThis makes sense because each such line contributes to a necessary step, and the order doesn't matter; you can cross them one by one.\n\nNow, how to implement this?\n\nFor each line a*x + b*y + c = 0, we can compute the sign of the expression for both the home and university. If the signs are different, then the line separates them.\n\nSo, for each line i:\n- Compute s1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i\n- Compute s2 = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i\n- If s1 and s2 have opposite signs (s1 * s2 < 0), then it's a separating line.\n\nThe total number of such lines is the answer.\n\nWait, that's it? Oh right, because each such line represents a boundary that needs to be crossed once. And since steps can be taken one at a time, each crossing is a step.\n\nSo the steps are exactly the number of lines where home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nThat's clever. So the problem reduces to counting how many lines separate the two points.\n\nSo now, the code is straightforward.\n\nRead x1, y1, x2, y2.\n\nRead n, then for each of the next n lines, read a, b, c.\n\nFor each line, compute s1 and s2.\n\nIf s1*s2 < 0, increment the count.\n\nFinally, output the count.\n\nWait, but wait: what if s1 or s2 is zero? But the problem statement says that neither home nor university is on any road, so a_i*x1 + b_i*y1 +c_i cannot be zero, same for the other point.\n\nSo no division by zero or anything. So this method works.\n\nLet me test this against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n1 1\n-1 -1\n2\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nSo home is (1,1), university (-1,-1).\n\nLine 1: 0x +1y +0=0 → y=0.\n\ns1 = 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1 >0.\n\ns2= -1*1 +0*(-1) +0= -1 <0. So s1*s2 =-1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nLine2: 1x +0y +0=0 → x=0.\n\ns1=1*1 +0*1 +0=1>0.\n\ns2=-1*1 +0*(-1)+0= -1<0 → s1*s2=-1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nTotal is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case in the sample:\n\nSecond case, perhaps similar.\n\nYes, the output is 2.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nRead the first two lines as home and university.\n\nThen read n, then n lines.\n\nFor each line, compute s1 and s2.\n\nCount the number where s1*s2 <0.\n\nPrint the count.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nWe can read the first two lines as tuples.\n\nThen process each line.\n\nWait, but for each line, the input is a, b, c. So:\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if s1 * s2 < 0:\n        count +=1\n\nThen print(count)\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what about the data types? Since x1, y1 can be up to 1e6, and a, b, c up to 1e3 each, multiplying gives up to 1e9, which is manageable in Python.\n\nSo, no issues with integer overflows.\n\nSo, the code should be as follows.\n\nI'll structure it:\n\nRead x1, y1 from the first line.\n\nRead x2, y2 from the second.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount =0\n\nfor each of the next n lines:\n\n   a, b, c = ...\n\n   s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n   s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n   if s1 * s2 <0: count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFirst sample:\n\nLines:\n\n0 1 0 → s1=1, s2=-1 → product negative.\n\n1 0 0 → s1=1, s2=-1 → product negative.\n\nSo count is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: suppose home and university are on the same side for all lines. Then the count is 0.\n\nLike, for example, when the two points are on the same side of every line.\n\nSo the code correctly returns 0.\n\nAnother case: one line, home and uni on opposite sides. Output is 1.\n\nSo, all cases handled.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step allows moving from one block to another if they share a non-zero length border.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each road (represented by a line) can either separate the home and the university or not. If a road separates them, it means you will need to cross that road at least once. The minimal number of steps required is equal to the number of such separating roads.\n\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each road divides the plane into two regions. By checking on which side of each road the home and university lie, we can determine if a road needs to be crossed.\n2. **Algorithm**:\n   - For each road, compute the sign of the expression for both the home and university coordinates.\n   - If the signs are different, the road separates the home and university, thus incrementing the count of necessary steps.\n3. **Efficiency**: This approach efficiently checks each road exactly once, leading to a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if s1 * s2 < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n- **Checking Each Road**: For each road, we compute the value of the line equation at the home and university coordinates. If these values have opposite signs, the road separates the two points.\n- **Counting Separating Roads**: Each separating road increments the count, which represents the minimal number of steps needed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum steps required by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their regions.",
