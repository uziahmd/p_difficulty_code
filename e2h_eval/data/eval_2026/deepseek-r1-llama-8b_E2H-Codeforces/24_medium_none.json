She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Luba is trying to close some tabs in her browser. Hmm, let me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo, the setup is that she has n tabs open, from 1 to n. The cursor starts at position pos. She needs to keep the tabs from l to r and close all others. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right, but only within the current available tabs. Or she can close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum number of seconds needed to achieve this.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. It seems like a problem that can be approached with BFS, because we're looking for the shortest path (minimum steps) to reach a certain state. Each state could represent the current position of the cursor and which tabs are still open. But wait, the state space might get too big if we track every possible subset of open tabs. So maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to figure out the order in which to close the tabs. Because once a tab is closed, it's gone forever, so the available tabs change. So each action affects the possible next moves.\n\nBut maybe instead of tracking the entire set of open tabs, we can model the state based on the current position and the range of open tabs. For example, when some tabs are closed, the available left and right boundaries change.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the initial state: all tabs are open. So the left boundary a is 1, and right boundary b is n. The cursor is at pos.\n\nEach time she moves the cursor, it's within [a, b]. When she closes left, all tabs to the left of the cursor are closed, so the new a becomes max(current a, cursor_pos). Similarly, closing right would set b to min(current b, cursor_pos).\n\nWait, no. Wait, when you close the left of the cursor, all tabs less than the cursor's position are closed. So the new a is the current cursor's position. Because any tabs beyond that to the left are now closed. Similarly, closing the right sets the new b to the cursor's position.\n\nSo after each close operation, the available tabs are between a and b, which are the current boundaries.\n\nSo the state can be represented by (current_position, a, b), where a is the leftmost open tab, and b is the rightmost open tab.\n\nWait, but initially, a=1 and b=n. After closing left, a becomes the current position, since all to the left are closed. Similarly, closing right sets b to the current position.\n\nWait no, because when you close left, you close all tabs to the left of the cursor. So the new a is the current cursor's position. Because any tabs before that are closed. So the new a is max(a, current position) — no, wait, the current position is part of the open tabs before the close. So after closing, the new a is the current position. Because the tabs before are closed.\n\nWait, for example: suppose a was 3, b was 6. Cursor is at 5. If she closes left, then all tabs before 5 (i.e., 3 and 4) are closed. So the new a is 5, because those are the first remaining tabs.\n\nSimilarly, if she's at position 2 and closes left, then a becomes 2, because all tabs before 2 are closed.\n\nSo yes, the state can be represented as (current position, a, b). But considering that the initial a is 1, and initial b is n.\n\nOur target is to reach a state where a = l and b = r, and then possibly close any remaining tabs on either side.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says she needs to leave exactly the tabs from l to r. So the final state must have a = l and b = r. Any other tabs outside this range must be closed.\n\nSo the plan is to model the state transitions and find the minimal steps to reach (l, r) as the a and b boundaries, along with the current position.\n\nWait, but the position can vary as long as a <= position <= b. Because moving the cursor within the current a and b doesn't require any closing steps.\n\nSo the minimal steps would be the sum of the steps taken to move to a certain position, and then perform the necessary close operations.\n\nLet me think about the steps required:\n\n1. Move the cursor to a position where she can close the left tabs.\n2. Close the left tabs.\n3. Move to a position where she can close the right tabs.\n4. Close the right tabs.\n\nAlternatively, she might do both closes in any order, depending on which is more efficient.\n\nSo perhaps the strategy is to decide whether to close left first or right first, and then compute the steps accordingly.\n\nAnother possibility is that she can close one side, then the other, without needing to move much.\n\nSo, let's consider the different cases.\n\nCase 1: l > 1. So she needs to close all tabs to the left of l.\n\nCase 2: r < n. She needs to close all tabs to the right of r.\n\nSo, the problem can be broken down into whether we need to close left and/or right.\n\nSo, the steps will involve:\n\n- Moving to a position where she can close left or right.\n- Perform the close.\n- Then, move to another position to close the other side.\n- Finally, perform the close.\n\nBut sometimes, it's possible that after closing one side, the other side is already within the current a and b, so she can just move and close.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal steps can be found by considering all possible orders and choosing the one with the least steps.\n\nSo, let's outline the possible scenarios.\n\nScenario A: Only need to close left (if l > 1). Steps: move to l, close left.\n\nScenario B: Only need to close right (if r < n). Steps: move to r, close right.\n\nScenario C: Both need to be closed. Steps: either move to l, close left, then move to r and close right; or move to r, close right, then move to l and close left. Which is better depends on the positions and the movement steps.\n\nAdditionally, there's another scenario: perhaps after closing one side, the other side is automatically included because the a and b are adjusted, so moving might not be needed.\n\nWait, for example: Suppose initial a is 1, b is 6. She wants to close left up to l=2 and close right up to r=4.\n\nShe starts at pos=3.\n\nShe can close left first: move to 2, close left (cost: 1 step for moving, 1 step for closing. Now a=2, b=6. Then, she needs to close right, which is from 4 onwards. So she needs to move from 2 to 4, which is 2 steps. Then close right, which is 1 step. Total steps: 1+1 + 2 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nWhich matches the first example.\n\nIn the second example, the input is '6 3 1 3'. So she needs to close everything to the right of 3. So she can close right directly from position 3. So she doesn't need to move anywhere else, just close right. So steps: 0 movement, 1 close. Total 1 step.\n\nThird example: '5 2 1 5' — she doesn't need to do anything, since all tabs are already in [1,5].\n\nSo, the approach is to determine whether we need to close left, right, both, or neither.\n\nIf neither is needed, output 0.\n\nOtherwise, for each case where both are needed, compute the steps for each possible order (left first or right first) and choose the minimal.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Check if l > 1: need to close left.\n\n2. Check if r < n: need to close right.\n\n3. Compute the minimal steps for all possible combinations of closing left and right.\n\nFor each combination:\n\na) Close left first, then close right.\n\nb) Close right first, then close left.\n\nCompute the steps for both options and choose the minimal.\n\nBut also, perhaps after closing one side, the other is already within the current a and b, so moving may not be needed.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nSuppose after closing left, a is l. So if r is larger than l, then the right side needs to be closed if r <n.\n\nSo, when we have both left and right to close, the steps are:\n\nOption 1: Close left first, then close right.\n\nSteps:\n\n- Move to l (from initial pos) → cost is |pos - l| steps.\n\n- Close left → 1 step.\n\nThen, move from l to r → |r - l| steps.\n\nClose right → 1 step.\n\nTotal: |pos - l| + 1 + |r - l| + 1.\n\nOption 2: Close right first, then close left.\n\nSteps:\n\n- Move to r → |pos - r| steps.\n\n- Close right → 1 step.\n\nThen, move from r to l → |r - l| steps.\n\nClose left → 1 step.\n\nTotal: |pos - r| + 1 + |r - l| + 1.\n\nCompare these two totals and choose the smaller.\n\nBut wait, what about the movement after closing? Like, after closing left, the a becomes l, so when moving to r, which is >= l, but the initial a after closing left is l, so moving from l to r is just r - l steps.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if after closing left, the a is l, but r is within a and b? No, because if r <n, then after closing left, the new a is l, but b remains as the previous value, unless r is in that segment.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the steps as:\n\nAfter closing left, the a is updated to current position (which is l). So, the new a is l, and b remains as whatever it was before, but perhaps the b is now the same or larger.\n\nWait, no: when you close left, the a becomes the current cursor's position. So after closing left, the a is l, and the b is whatever it was before (could be original b, or if you had closed right before, it's lower).\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to model the process as follows.\n\nWhen you close left, you can only do so when you are at a position i. Then, all tabs to the left of i (i.e., less than i) are closed. So the new a becomes i.\n\nSimilarly, when you close right, the new b becomes i.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nFor option 1 (close left first):\n\n1. Start at pos.\n\n2. Move to l: steps needed is |pos - l|.\n\n3. Close left: 1 step.\n\nNow, a becomes l.\n\n4. Need to close right: so move to r, which is in [l, current b], which is [l, ... ].\n\nSteps to move: r - l.\n\n5. Close right: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: |pos - l| + 1 + (r - l) + 1.\n\nFor option 2 (close right first):\n\n1. Start at pos.\n\n2. Move to r: steps |pos - r|.\n\n3. Close right: 1 step.\n\nNow, b becomes r.\n\n4. Need to close left: move from r to l. Since l could be <= r, but after closing right, the a is still 1, but wait—no, after closing right, the a remains as it was before. Oh right! Because closing right only affects the right side. So after closing right, the a is unchanged. So the a is still 1, but the b is r.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the a is the leftmost open tab. Initially, a is 1. Closing right doesn't affect a. So after closing right, the a remains as 1, but the b is r.\n\nSo when you need to close the left side, you have to move from r to l, which could be a distance of l - r (but that's negative, so absolute is r - l). So steps needed is |r - l|.\n\nThen, close left: 1 step.\n\nSo the total steps for option 2: |pos - r| + 1 + (r - l) + 1.\n\nSo, the minimal between the two options is the answer, provided both left and right need to be closed.\n\nWait, but what if after closing one side, the other is already within the current a and b?\n\nLike, suppose after closing left, a becomes l, and r is within a and b. Then, when moving to r, it's just r - l steps.\n\nSimilarly, after closing right, the b becomes r, and l is within a (which is 1) and b.\n\nSo yes, the calculation above holds.\n\nBut wait, what about when l is 1? Then, closing left is unnecessary.\n\nSimilarly, if r is n, closing right is unnecessary.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe can compute whether we need to close left (left_needed = l > 1), and close right (right_needed = r < n).\n\nThen, the total steps would be:\n\nif neither needed: 0.\n\nelif only left: steps to move to l and close left.\n\nelif only right: steps to move to r and close right.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute both options and take the minimal.\n\nBut wait, let's think about another scenario: maybe moving to a position that allows both closes in fewer steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal path isn't just to close left first then right, or right first then left. Maybe there's a way to minimize the movement steps by choosing a different order.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's see.\n\nTake an example where pos is in between l and r.\n\nLike, n=10, pos=5, l=3, r=7.\n\nNeed to close left and right.\n\nOption 1: Close left first.\n\nMove from 5 to 3: 2 steps.\n\nClose left: 1.\n\nMove to 7: 4 steps.\n\nClose right: 1.\n\nTotal: 2+1+4+1=8.\n\nOption 2: Close right first.\n\nMove from 5 to 7: 2 steps.\n\nClose right: 1.\n\nMove to 3: 4 steps.\n\nClose left:1.\n\nTotal: 2+1+4+1=8.\n\nSame steps.\n\nAnother example: pos is closer to l.\n\nn=10, pos=4, l=2, r=9.\n\nClose left:\n\nmove from 4 to 2: 2 steps.\n\nclose left:1.\n\nmove to 9: 7 steps.\n\nclose right:1.\n\nTotal: 2+1+7+1=11.\n\nClose right first:\n\nmove to 9:5 steps.\n\nclose right:1.\n\nmove to 2:7 steps.\n\nclose left:1.\n\nTotal:5+1+7+1=14. So option 1 is better.\n\nAnother example where the order matters.\n\nSo, in code, we need to calculate both options and choose the minimal.\n\nBut wait, what about when after closing left, the right side is already covered? Or vice versa.\n\nNo, because if you close left, then the a becomes l, but the right side (r) may be larger than l, but if r is less than n, you still need to close the right side.\n\nSo, the steps to close right after closing left are necessary.\n\nSo, the formula for the two options is correct.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nCheck if left and/or right are needed.\n\nIf neither needed, return 0.\n\nIf only left needed: steps = |pos - l| + 1.\n\nIf only right needed: steps = |pos - r| + 1.\n\nElse:\n\noption1 = |pos - l| + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n\noption2 = |pos - r| + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n\nchoose the minimal between option1 and option2.\n\nWait, but wait. Is the (r-l) steps always needed? Because after closing left, the a is l, and r is >= l, so moving from l to r is r - l steps.\n\nSimilarly, after closing right, the b is r, and l is <= r, so moving from r to l is r - l steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the formula for the options is correct.\n\nWait, but wait: when you close right, the b becomes r, but l could be <= r.\n\nSo after closing right, the a is still 1 (assuming we didn't close left yet), but since we're going to close left, the a becomes l.\n\nWait, no, in the scenario where we first close right, then close left.\n\nAfter closing right, the b becomes r.\n\nSo when we go to close left, we need to move from r to l, which is (r - l) steps.\n\nBecause after closing right, the a is still 1, but we have to close the left, which requires moving to l and closing.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nmove to r (from pos), close right (1 step). Now, a is 1, b is r.\n\nThen, move from r to l (since after closing right, l is in [1, r], so it's r - l steps. Close left: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: |pos - r| + 1 + (r - l) + 1.\n\nWhich is the same as option2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nSo, in code, the steps can be calculated as follows.\n\nNow, let's see the sample input.\n\nSample 1: 6 3 2 4.\n\nLeft needed: 2>1 → yes.\n\nRight needed:4<6 → yes.\n\nSo, option1: |3-2|=1 +1 + (4-2)=2 +1 → total 5.\n\nOption2: |3-4|=1 +1 + (4-2)=2 +1 → 5.\n\nSo minimal is 5.\n\nSample2:6 3 1 3.\n\nOnly right needed:3<6 → yes.\n\nSteps: |3-3|=0 +1 → 1.\n\nSample3:5 2 1 5.\n\nNo left or right needed. So 0.\n\nSo the code correctly handles the samples.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5.\n\nNo steps needed → 0.\n\nAnother test: n=7, pos=4, l=2, r=4.\n\nNo steps: because l=2, but initial a is 1. So need to close left.\n\nWait, l is 2, which is greater than 1. So need to close left.\n\nSteps: move from 4 to 2 → 2 steps. Close left → 1 step. Total 3.\n\nWait, but according to our formula, option1 would be |4-2|=2 +1 + (4-2)=2 +1 → 6 steps. But wait, after closing left, a becomes 2. So the right side is from 2 to 4, and r=4 is within that. So no need to move to r, since we already have a=2 and b=7 (initially). Wait, no: after closing left, the a is 2, but the b is still 7 because we haven't closed the right yet.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because in the initial scenario, when you have to close both sides, the a and b are initially 1 and n.\n\nWait, perhaps my earlier reasoning is incorrect. Because after closing left, the a becomes the current position, but the b remains as it was before.\n\nSo, in the example where l=2, r=4, and pos=4.\n\nAfter closing left: a becomes 4, but wait, no. Wait, when you close left, you are at position 4. So all tabs to the left of 4 are closed. So the new a is 4. Because the left of 4 is closed.\n\nWait, no, wait: closing left when at position i, closes all tabs less than i. So the new a is i.\n\nSo, after closing left, a becomes 4, and b remains 7.\n\nBut the desired r is 4. So the right side (5-7) still needs to be closed.\n\nSo, after closing left, the a is 4, but the b is 7.\n\nSo, to close the right side, she needs to move from 4 to 4 (no steps?), then close right. So steps are:\n\nClose left: 1 step.\n\nClose right: 1 step.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because she can't close right until she's at a position where the right side is beyond her.\n\nWait, no, she can close the right of the cursor.\n\nAt position 4, the right side is 5-7. So closing right will close those.\n\nSo, in the scenario where l=2, r=4, pos=4.\n\nShe needs to close left (tabs 1 and 2) and close right (tabs 5-7).\n\nSo steps:\n\nOption 1: close left first.\n\nMove to 2: 2 steps (from 4 to 2).\n\nClose left: 1 step.\n\nNow, a is 2.\n\nBut she also needs to close right: from 5-7.\n\nSo, she needs to move from 2 to 4 (2 steps) then close right (1 step).\n\nTotal steps: 2+1+2+1=6.\n\nBut wait, perhaps she can find a more efficient way.\n\nWait, after closing left, she is at position 2. To close the right, she can just move from 2 to 4, which is 2 steps, then close right.\n\nBut wait, perhaps she can close right while being at 2. Because the right side is 5-7.\n\nWait, when she is at 2, the right side is 3-7. So she can't close right from 2 because she can't reach 4 in that state.\n\nWait, no. Wait, after closing left, a is 2, but the b is 7.\n\nSo she can move freely between 2 and 7.\n\nSo, after closing left, she can move from 2 to 4, which takes 2 steps.\n\nThen close right.\n\nSo total steps are 2 (move to 2) + 1 (close left) + 2 (move to 4) + 1 (close right) = 6.\n\nAlternatively, can she do better?\n\nWhat if she closes right first.\n\nShe is at 4. She can close right, which would close 5-7. Then, she needs to close left (tabs 1-3).\n\nShe is at 4. So she can move to 2 (2 steps), close left (1 step).\n\nTotal steps: 0 (no movement to close right) + 1 (close right) + 2 (move to 2) + 1 (close left) → 4 steps.\n\nWait, that's better.\n\nWait, why? Because after closing right, the b becomes 4.\n\nSo, to close the left, she can move from 4 to 2 (2 steps), then close left (1 step).\n\nTotal steps: 0 (moving to r=4 is already where she is) → 1 (close right) + 2 (move to 2) + 1 (close left) → total 4 steps.\n\nThat's better than 6 steps.\n\nSo, the order of closing matters in this case. So, the initial approach of calculating option1 and option2 is correct.\n\nWait, but in this case, option2 (close right first) gives a better result.\n\nSo, in code, when both options are considered, the minimal is chosen.\n\nSo, let's reevaluate the formula.\n\nIn this example, n=7, pos=4, l=2, r=4.\n\nleft_needed = True.\n\nright_needed = True.\n\noption1: move to 2 (steps 2), close left (1), move to 4 (2), close right (1). Total 6.\n\noption2: move to 4 (0 steps), close right (1), move to 2 (2), close left (1). Total 4.\n\nSo, the minimal is 4.\n\nThus, the formula for option2 is |pos - r| + 1 + (r - l) +1.\n\nWhich is 0 + 1 + (4-2) +1 → 4.\n\nSo the formula holds.\n\nSo, the code should correctly compute this.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nCompute left_needed = (l > 1).\n\nCompute right_needed = (r < n).\n\nIf neither, output 0.\n\nElse if only left needed: steps = |pos - l| + 1.\n\nElse if only right needed: steps = |pos - r| +1.\n\nElse:\n\noption1 = |pos - l| + 1 + (r - l) + 1.\n\noption2 = |pos - r| + 1 + (r - l) + 1.\n\nmin_steps = min(option1, option2).\n\nOutput min_steps.\n\nWait, but wait: what about the movement after closing? Because after closing left, the a becomes l, so moving to r may be possible.\n\nBut in the code, the movement steps are computed as |pos - l| + |r - l|.\n\nBut that's correct, because after closing left, the cursor is at l, then moving to r is r - l steps.\n\nSimilarly, after closing right, moving to l is |r - l| steps.\n\nSo the formula holds.\n\nSo, the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nTest case 1: n=1, pos=1, l=1, r=1. Output 0.\n\nTest case 2: n=2, pos=1, l=1, r=2. Output 0.\n\nTest case 3: n=2, pos=1, l=1, r=1. So need to close right. Steps: move to 1 (already there), close right → 1 step.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, pos=2, l=1, r=3. So no steps needed.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=4. Left needed (l=2>1), right needed (4<5).\n\noption1: move to 2 (1 step), close left (1), move to4 (2 steps), close right (1). Total 5.\n\noption2: move to4 (1 step), close right (1), move to2 (2 steps), close left (1). Total 5.\n\nSo, minimal is 5.\n\nAnother test case: n=4, pos=2, l=2, r=3. Right needed (3 <4). Steps: move to3 (1 step), close right (1). Total 2.\n\nBut according to the formula: steps = |2-3| +1 =1+1=2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=3, l=3, r=5. Left needed (3>1), right needed (5<5 → no). So only left.\n\nSteps: |3-3| +1=0+1=1.\n\nWait, but wait: l=3>1, so she needs to close tabs 1 and 2.\n\nSo she is at 3, so closing left will close 1-2. So steps: 0 movement, 1 close. Yes.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=1, l=3, r=5.\n\nLeft needed (3>1): yes.\n\nSteps: move from 1 to3: 2 steps. Close left:1. Total 3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=4, l=3, r=5.\n\nLeft needed: yes (3>1).\n\nSteps: move to3 (1 step), close left (1). Total 2.\n\nBut wait, after closing left, a=3, and the right is 5.\n\nShe can then close right: move to5 (2 steps), close right (1). So total steps 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, option1 is |4-3|=1 +1 + (5-3)=2 +1 → total 5.\n\nBut option2 is |4-5|=1 +1 + (5-3)=2 +1 → total 5.\n\nSo, in code, the minimal is 5.\n\nBut is there a better way?\n\nNo, because she can't close right until she's at 3 or beyond.\n\nWait, wait, after closing left, she's at 3, and she needs to close right (tabs 4-5). So she has to move from 3 to5, which is 2 steps, then close right.\n\nSo, steps are 1 (move to3) +1 (close left) +2 (move to5) +1 (close right) → 5 steps.\n\nAlternatively, can she close right first.\n\nShe is at4. Close right: tabs5 is closed. So, b=4.\n\nThen, she needs to close left: move from4 to3 (1 step), close left.\n\nTotal steps: 0 (already at4) +1 (close right) +1 (move to3) +1 (close left) → 3 steps.\n\nWait, that's better.\n\nWait, in this scenario:\n\nn=5, pos=4, l=3, r=5.\n\nShe needs to close left (1-2) and close right (none, since r=5=5? Wait, no: r=5 is equal to n=5, so she doesn't need to close right.\n\nWait, wait: right_needed is r <n → 5<5 is false. So right_needed is False.\n\nSo, she only needs to close left.\n\nSo, the steps are: move from4 to3 (1 step), close left (1 step). Total 2 steps.\n\nBut according to the code, for this case:\n\nleft_needed is true, right_needed is false.\n\nSo steps are |4-3|=1 +1=2 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nAh, right, I had a wrong understanding earlier. So, in this case, she only needs to close left.\n\nSo, the code correctly calculates it.\n\nAnother example where she needs to close both.\n\nn=10, pos=5, l=3, r=8.\n\nleft_needed: 3>1 → yes.\n\nright_needed:8<10 → yes.\n\noption1: |5-3|=2 +1 + (8-3)=5 +1 → total 9.\n\noption2: |5-8|=3 +1 +5 +1 → 10.\n\nSo minimal is 9.\n\nSo, code would compute 9 steps.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nThe code will:\n\n- Read n, pos, l, r.\n\n- Check if l>1 → left_needed = True.\n\n- Check if r <n → right_needed = True.\n\n- If not left_needed and not right_needed → print 0.\n\n- Else if only left needed → steps = |pos - l| +1.\n\n- Else if only right needed → steps = |pos - r| +1.\n\n- Else:\n\n   option1 = |pos - l| +1 + (r - l) +1.\n\n   option2 = |pos - r| +1 + (r - l) +1.\n\n   steps = min(option1, option2).\n\n   print(steps).\n\nSo, that's the code.\n\nTesting it against the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:6 3 2 4.\n\nleft_needed: True.\n\nright_needed: True.\n\noption1: 1+1+2+1=5.\n\noption2:1+1+2+1=5.\n\nmin is5.\n\nSample2:\n\n6 3 1 3.\n\nright_needed:3<6 → yes.\n\nsteps: |3-3|=0 +1 →1.\n\nSample3:\n\n5 2 1 5.\n\nboth needed → no.\n\noutput 0.\n\nSo, correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=7, pos=4, l=2, r=4.\n\nleft_needed: True.\n\nright_needed:4<7 → yes.\n\noption1: |4-2|=2 +1 +2 +1=6.\n\noption2: |4-4|=0 +1 +2 +1=4.\n\nSo minimal is4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=10, pos=5, l=3, r=8.\n\noption1: 2+1+5+1=9.\n\noption2:3+1+5+1=10. So 9 steps.\n\nThus, code works.\n\nSo, now, writing the code.\n\nRead four integers from input.\n\nCompute left_needed and right_needed.\n\nThen, handle the cases.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nleft_needed = l > 1\n\nright_needed = r < n\n\nif not left_needed and not right_needed:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n    # compute option1 and option2\n\n    option1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) +1\n\n    option2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) +1\n\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nelif left_needed:\n\n    print(abs(pos - l) +1)\n\nelse:\n\n    print(abs(pos - r) +1)\n\nWait, but wait: in the else clause, it's when only right_needed is true.\n\nBut what if both are false? That's handled earlier.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the code.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=5, pos=4, l=3, r=5.\n\nleft_needed:3>1 → yes.\n\nright_needed:5<5 → no.\n\nso code executes left_needed block.\n\nsteps: |4-3|=1 +1 →2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=7, pos=4, l=2, r=4.\n\nleft_needed: yes.\n\nright_needed:4<7 → yes.\n\noption1: 2 +1 +2 +1=6.\n\noption2:0+1+2+1=4.\n\nso minimal is4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=4, pos=2, l=2, r=3.\n\nright_needed:3<4 → yes.\n\nsteps: |2-3|=1 +1=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment in her browser. The approach involves calculating the optimal steps required to move the cursor and close the necessary tabs efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Needs**: Determine if Luba needs to close tabs to the left of `l` (left_needed) and/or to the right of `r` (right_needed).\n2. **Calculate Steps**:\n   - If neither left nor right tabs need to be closed, the result is 0.\n   - If only left tabs need to be closed, calculate the steps to move to `l` and close them.\n   - If only right tabs need to be closed, calculate the steps to move to `r` and close them.\n   - If both left and right tabs need to be closed, compute the steps for both possible orders (closing left first then right, or right first then left) and choose the minimal steps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nleft_needed = l > 1\nright_needed = r < n\n\nif not left_needed and not right_needed:\n    print(0)\nelif left_needed and right_needed:\n    option1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n    option2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n    print(min(option1, option2))\nelif left_needed:\n    print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\nelse:\n    print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Identify Needs**: We check if `l` is greater than 1 (indicating tabs to the left of `l` need closing) and if `r` is less than `n` (indicating tabs to the right of `r` need closing).\n- **Calculate Steps**:\n  - If neither tab closure is needed, output 0.\n  - If only left tabs need closing, compute the steps to move from the current position to `l` and close those tabs.\n  - If only right tabs need closing, compute the steps to move from the current position to `r` and close those tabs.\n  - If both tabs need closing, evaluate both possible orders of closing (left first or right first) and choose the order with fewer steps.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum steps required by considering all possible scenarios and selecting the optimal one.",
