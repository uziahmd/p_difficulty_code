He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine for each of the 2n-2 given strings whether it's a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. The output is a string where each character is either 'P' or 'S' based on that classification.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nThe input gives me all possible prefixes and suffixes except for the full string itself. For each possible string length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings provided—each being a prefix or a suffix. My task is to assign each of these strings to be either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S) in the output.\n\nWait, but how do I figure out which one is a prefix and which is a suffix? Because for each position in the original string, certain substrings are prefixes, others are suffixes, but they might overlap in some way.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's say the original string is s of length n. Then, all proper prefixes (length 1 to n-1) are given, as well as all proper suffixes. But wait, no—some of the given strings could be both a prefix and a suffix, but in reality, only one of them can be the actual prefix, and the other the suffix for the same length, right?\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that for each length l from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings: one is a prefix, the other is a suffix. So for each l, among the two strings of that length, one must be the prefix and the other the suffix.\n\nSo the first step is to group the given strings by their lengths. For each l, we'll have two strings. Now, for each such pair, we need to decide whether the first is the prefix and the second the suffix, or vice versa.\n\nBut how do we make that decision? Because depending on the choice, the rest of the assignment might fall into place or not.\n\nI think the key here is to find a string s that has all the assigned prefixes and suffixes according to our choices. Because the actual string must satisfy that all the chosen P's are indeed prefixes and S's are suffixes.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. For each possible grouping of the pairs (for each length l, decide which string is the prefix and which is the suffix), try to construct the string s that fits all these choices.\n2. Once a valid s is found, assign the labels accordingly.\n\nBut wait, considering that n can be up to 100, and for each length we have 2 options, the total possibilities would be 2^(n-1). For n=100, that's way too big—2^99 is impossible to handle computationally.\n\nSo that approach isn't feasible. We need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think differently. Since the string s must have certain prefixes and suffixes, perhaps the prefixes and suffixes must form a chain. For example, the prefix of length l must be the same as the prefix of length l+1 for the first l characters. Similarly for suffixes.\n\nWait, but no. Because for the string s, the prefix of length l is the first l characters, and the prefix of length l+1 starts with the prefix of l. Similarly, the suffix of l is the last l characters, and the suffix of l+1 ends with the suffix of l.\n\nSo, if I can find a way to link the prefixes and suffixes for different lengths, perhaps I can reconstruct s.\n\nAnother idea: Let's suppose that for each length l, the prefix is p_l and the suffix is s_l. Then, the actual string s must have p_1 as its first character, p_2 as the first two, etc. Similarly, the suffix s_1 is the last character, s_2 is the last two, and so on.\n\nSo, the entire string s must be consistent with all these p_l and s_l. That is, for any l, the first l characters of s must be p_l, and the last l characters must be s_l.\n\nThis suggests that for each l, p_l must be a prefix of s, and s_l must be a suffix of s. Moreover, for the next l', p_{l'} must start with p_l, and s_{l'} must end with s_l.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find the correct s by ensuring that for all l, the p_l is the first l characters of s, and s_l is the last l of s. But how?\n\nAn alternative approach: Let's consider that the prefixes form a chain. For each l, the prefix of length l is the first l characters of the prefix of length l+1. Similarly, the suffixes form a chain where each suffix of length l is the last l characters of the suffix of length l+1.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true because the suffixes are of varying lengths and may not overlap correctly.\n\nWait, no. Because the suffix of length l+1 is the last l+1 characters of s. So, the suffix of length l is the last l characters of s, which is the same as the last l characters of the suffix of l+1.\n\nSimilarly, the prefix of length l is the first l characters of s, which is the same as the first l characters of the prefix of l+1.\n\nSo, for the prefixes, p_1 is the first character, p_2 is the first two, etc. Each p_l must be the first l characters of p_{l+1}.\n\nSimilarly, for the suffixes, s_1 is the last character, s_2 is the last two, etc. Each s_l must be the last l characters of s_{l+1}.\n\nSo, the idea is that for all l, p_l must be a prefix of p_{l+1}, and s_l must be a suffix of s_{l+1}.\n\nWait, but since the given strings include for each l both p_l and s_l, perhaps we can use this to build a possible s.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: For each possible starting point (i.e., choosing which string is the prefix for each l), try to build s step by step.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the fact that for the entire string s, the prefix of length l must match the given p_l, and the suffix of length l must match the given s_l.\n\nBut s is built such that for each l, s starts with p_l and ends with s_l.\n\nMoreover, the entire s must be consistent across all l. So, for example, the first character of p_2 must be equal to p_1, the first two characters of p_3 must equal p_2, etc.\n\nSimilarly, the last character of s_2 must be equal to s_1, and so on.\n\nSo, perhaps for each l, we can check if p_l is a prefix of s and s_l is a suffix of s. But how do I find s without knowing it?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct s can be constructed by taking the maximum possible prefix and suffix. Or maybe s is the minimal string that contains all the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible l, the prefix p_l and the suffix s_l must be compatible. For instance, the last character of p_l must be equal to the first character of s_l if l+1 is considered. Hmm, maybe not directly.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find for each possible l, the p_l and s_l must satisfy that the last character of p_l is the first character of s_1, but that's only for l = n-1.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAnother idea: For each possible l, the p_l and s_l must satisfy that p_l is a prefix of s, and s_l is a suffix of s. Moreover, for l+1, p_{l+1} must be the prefix of p_l plus some character, and similarly for s.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as building s step by step.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Group all the given strings by their lengths. So, for each l (from 1 to n-1), we have two strings: one is the prefix, the other is the suffix.\n\n2. For each l, we need to decide which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\n3. Once this decision is made, the prefixes and suffixes are known. Then, the string s must be such that for each l, the prefix of length l is the first l characters of s, and the suffix of length l is the last l characters of s.\n\n4. So, the entire string s must be the concatenation of the prefix of length l and the suffix of length (n-l), but adjusted so that the suffix's first part overlaps with the prefix's latter part.\n\nWait, that makes sense. For example, for a string of length 5, if the prefix of length 3 is \"aba\" and the suffix of length 2 is \"ba\", then s would be \"ababa\". Because the prefix is \"aba\", and the suffix is \"ba\", which matches the last two letters of \"ababa\".\n\nSo, the way to find s is to take the prefix for l, and the suffix for m, ensuring that the suffix's first (m - l) characters match the prefix's last (m - l) characters. Wait, but m would be the length of the suffix, which is n - l.\n\nNo, wait. Let me think again. Suppose the prefix is p_l, which is the first l characters of s. The suffix is s_m, which is the last m characters of s. So, m must be equal to n - l, because the sum of l and m is n.\n\nYes, because the total length is n, so if the prefix is length l, then the suffix must be length n - l. So, for each l, the suffix is s_{n - l}.\n\nSo, for each possible l (from 1 to n-1), the prefix is p_l, suffix is s_{n - l}. And s is p_l + s_{n-l}.\n\nBut wait, p_l is of length l, s_{n-l} is of length n - l. So when we concatenate them, the total length is l + (n-l) = n, which is correct.\n\nBut for this to work, the suffix s_{n-l} must end with the same (n-l) characters as the last (n-l) characters of s. Which is the same as saying that the first (n-l) characters of s_{n-l} must match the last (n-l) characters of p_l.\n\nWait, no. Because s is p_l concatenated with s_{n-l}, but s_{n-l} is the last (n-l) characters of s. So, s = p_l + s_{n-l}.\n\nThus, for s to be consistent, the last (n-l) characters of p_l must match s_{n-l}.\n\nSo, for each l, the suffix s_{n-l} must be equal to the last (n-l) characters of p_l.\n\nWait, that's a crucial condition. So, for each l, the suffix of length (n-l) must be a suffix of the prefix of length l. Because s is formed by p_l followed by s_{n-l}, which is the suffix.\n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\nFor each l from 1 to n-1:\n   m = n - l\n   the suffix of length m (s_m) must be the last m characters of p_l.\n\nBut wait, since for each l, p_l is the prefix, and s_m is the suffix, but m is n - l. So, for each l, s_m must be the last m characters of p_l.\n\nSo, for each l, s_m must be equal to p_l[-m:].\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. For each l, find m = n - l.\n\n2. For each l, the suffix s_m must be the last m characters of p_l.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each l, among the two possible strings of length l, choose which one is p_l and which is s_m, such that s_m equals p_l's last m characters.\n\nBut how do I choose which one is p_l and which is s_m for each l? Because for each l, there are two strings, and for each l, the p_l must be a prefix of s, and s_m must be a suffix of s.\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, the two strings are candidates for p_l and s_l (but wait, no, because s_l is the suffix of length l, but here m is n - l, which might be different).\n\nWait, no. Because for each l, the given strings are of length l, and for each l, we have to choose one as the prefix and the other as the suffix. But the suffix is of length l, not m.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-express.\n\nEach given string is either a prefix or a suffix of s. So, for each l, the two strings of length l are the prefix and suffix. But in terms of the overall string s, the prefix of length l is a substring of s, as is the suffix of length l.\n\nBut s is built by combining the prefix of l and the suffix of (n-l), because the total length is n.\n\nSo, the condition is that for each l, the suffix of length (n - l) (which is s_{n-l}) must be equal to the last (n-l) characters of the prefix of length l (p_l). Because s is p_l followed by s_{n-l}.\n\nSo, for each l, among the two strings of length l, one is p_l and the other is s_l. But wait, no—because for l, s_l is the suffix of length l, which is separate from the suffix of length (n-l).\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as for each l, the suffix of s is of length l, which is s_l. So, for the overall string s, the suffix of length l is s_l.\n\nBut how does this relate to the suffix of length (n-l)?\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to structure the steps again.\n\nGiven that the correct string s is formed by p_l (prefix of length l) followed by s_{n-l} (suffix of length n-l), and that s_{n-l} must be a suffix of p_l (since s is p_l + s_{n-l}, so the last (n-l) characters of s are s_{n-l}).\n\nSo, for each l, the suffix s_{n-l} must be equal to the last (n-l) characters of p_l.\n\nSo, for each l, among the two strings of length l, one will be p_l, and the other will be s_{n-l}.\n\nWait, but that can't be, because the other string is of length l, but s_{n-l} is of length (n-l), which is different unless l = n-l, which would be for even n.\n\nWait, no, because for each l, the two strings are of length l, but s_{n-l} is of length (n-l). So, for example, if n is 5 and l is 3, then n-l is 2. So, the two strings of length 3 are p_3 and s_3. But s_{n-l} is s_2, which is a different length.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. So I think I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that for each l, the two strings are of length l, but one is a prefix and the other a suffix of s. So, for each l, the two strings are p_l and s_l. But p_l is the prefix of length l, and s_l is the suffix of length l.\n\nBut then, the suffix of length (n - l) is s_{n-l}, which is a different string.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think of this as a graph problem.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's imagine that the prefixes form a chain where each prefix is longer than the previous by one character. Similarly, the suffixes form a chain where each suffix is longer than the previous by one character.\n\nFor example, the prefix of length 1 is the first character, which is the same as the first character of the prefix of length 2, and so on.\n\nSimilarly, the suffix of length 1 is the last character, which is the same as the last character of the suffix of length 2, etc.\n\nSo, for the prefixes, the chain is p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n-1}, where each p_i is one character longer than p_{i-1}.\n\nSimilarly, for the suffixes, the chain is s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n-1}, each one character longer than the previous.\n\nBut how does this help?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to find a way to merge the prefixes and suffixes into a single string s.\n\nHere's another idea: Let's iterate through the possible lengths l and for each l, find the common character between the current prefix and the suffix.\n\nFor example, for l=1, the prefix is p_1, which is a single character. The suffix s_1 is also a single character. So, s must start with p_1 and end with s_1. Also, the last character of p_1 (which is p_1) must equal the first character of s_1 (which is s_1). So, p_1[0] must equal s_1[0].\n\nWait, but wait: p_1 is the first character of s, and s_1 is the last character of s. So, s's first character is p_1, and s's last character is s_1.\n\nSo, for l=1, the two strings are p_1 and s_1. The condition is that the first character of s is p_1, and the last character is s_1.\n\nAdditionally, the first character of s_1 must equal the last character of p_1.\n\nSo, p_1[0] must equal s_1[0].\n\nSo, for l=1, the two strings must have the same first character (since p_1 is the first character of s) and the same last character as s_1.\n\nWait, but p_1 is a single character, so p_1[0] is p_1 itself. Similarly, s_1 is a single character, so s_1[0] is s_1.\n\nSo, p_1 must equal s_1.\n\nBecause the first character of s is p_1, and the last is s_1. So, p_1 must be equal to s_1.\n\nSo, for l=1, the two strings must be the same. Because p_1 is the first character, s_1 is the last, and they must be the same.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first case has n=5. The output is 'SPPSPSPS'. Looking at the input, perhaps for l=1, the two strings are 'a' and 'a'—so both are the same. So, in that case, p_1 and s_1 are both 'a'.\n\nSo, that's a condition that must hold for l=1: the two strings must be the same.\n\nBut what if that's not the case? Then, it's impossible to have a string s that satisfies the conditions.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that there exists a string s that satisfies the conditions. So, for each l, the two strings must be compatible in some way.\n\nSo, perhaps the algorithm is:\n\n1. For each l from 1 to n-1, group the two strings of that length.\n\n2. For each l, decide which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\n3. Ensure that for each l, the suffix of length (n-l) is equal to the last (n-l) characters of the prefix of length l.\n\nBut how do I make this decision?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to look for the longest possible prefix chain. For example, for l=1, the two strings must be the same, as discussed.\n\nOnce that is fixed, for l=2, the prefix p_2 must start with p_1, and the suffix s_2 must end with s_1.\n\nWait, but s_2 is a suffix of s, which is the last two characters of s. Similarly, p_2 is the first two characters.\n\nSo, for l=2, the two strings are p_2 and s_2. We need to choose which is p_2 and which is s_2.\n\nBut p_2 must be the prefix, so it must start with p_1. s_2 must end with s_1.\n\nSo, for l=2, among the two strings, one must start with p_1, and the other must end with s_1.\n\nBut s_1 is already known—it's the same as p_1.\n\nSo, for l=2, the two strings are candidates for p_2 and s_2.\n\nWe can choose one of them as p_2, and the other as s_2, provided that p_2 starts with p_1, and s_2 ends with s_1 (which is p_1).\n\nOnce p_2 is chosen as the prefix, s_2 must be the suffix, and must end with p_1.\n\nSo, the process could be:\n\n- Start with l=1: choose p_1 and s_1 as the same string (since they must be equal).\n\n- For l=2: among the two strings, pick the one that starts with p_1 as p_2, and the other as s_2. Then, check if s_2 ends with p_1.\n\nIf this is possible, proceed to l=3.\n\nContinue this until all l are processed.\n\nBut how do I know which string to pick as p_l for each l?\n\nIt seems like a recursive or backtracking approach, but for n=100, that's not feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a deterministic way to choose for each l which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nLet me think about the example given.\n\nIn the first sample input, n=5.\n\nThe strings are grouped as follows:\n\nLength 1: 'a' and 'a' → p_1 is 'a', s_1 is 'a'.\n\nLength 2: 'ab' and 'ba' → which is p_2 and s_2?\n\nWe need to pick one as p_2 (the prefix of length 2) and the other as s_2 (the suffix of length 2).\n\nBut p_2 must start with p_1 ('a'), and s_2 must end with s_1 ('a').\n\nSo, looking at the two strings:\n\n'ab' starts with 'a' → possible as p_2.\n\n'ba' ends with 'a'? No, 'ba' ends with 'a'? No, 'ba' ends with 'a' only if the last character is 'a'. 'ba' ends with 'a'? Yes, wait, 'ba' ends with 'a' as the second character.\n\nWait, 'ba' is the string 'b' followed by 'a'. So, the last character is 'a', so s_2 could be 'ba' if it ends with 'a'.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the correct s is 'ababa'.\n\nSo, p_2 is 'ab', s_2 is 'ba'.\n\nCheck: 'ab' starts with 'a' → yes. 'ba' ends with 'a' → yes.\n\nSo, the choice is p_2='ab' and s_2='ba'.\n\nProceeding to l=3: the two strings are 'aba' and 'aba'.\n\nWait, in the first sample, the two strings for l=3 are 'aba' and 'aba'—so they are the same. So, p_3 and s_3 must both be 'aba'.\n\nThen, for l=4: the two strings are 'abab' and 'baba'.\n\nWhich one is p_4 and which is s_4.\n\np_4 must start with p_3, which is 'aba'. So, 'abab' starts with 'aba' → yes.\n\ns_4 must end with s_3, which is 'aba'. So, the last 3 characters of s_4 must be 'aba'.\n\nLooking at the two options for l=4: 'abab' ends with 'bab' → not 'aba'; 'baba' ends with 'aba' → yes.\n\nSo, s_4 is 'baba', and p_4 is 'abab'.\n\nWait, but s_4 is the suffix of length 4, which is 'baba' in this case.\n\nBut then, the total string s is p_4 + s_4 = 'abab' + 'baba' = 'ababababa'? But wait, that's length 8, but n is 5. Hmm, I think I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for l=4, n-l=1. So, s_4 is the suffix of length 1, which is 'a'. But in the sample, the suffix of length 4 is 'baba'? That can't be, because n=5, so the suffix of length 4 is the last 4 characters of s.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate.\n\nIn the first sample, n=5. So, for l=1: p_1 is 'a', s_1 is 'a'.\n\nFor l=2: p_2 is 'ab', s_2 is 'ba'.\n\nFor l=3: p_3 is 'aba', s_3 is 'aba'.\n\nFor l=4: the two strings are 'abab' and 'baba'.\n\nWe need to choose p_4 and s_4 such that p_4 starts with p_3 ('aba') and s_4 ends with s_3 ('aba').\n\nSo, 'abab' starts with 'aba' → yes. 'baba' starts with 'aba'? No, 'baba' starts with 'b'. So, p_4 must be 'abab' and s_4 must be 'baba'.\n\nBut wait, the suffix s_4 is the last 4 characters of s. So, s is p_4 (length 4) + s_{n-l} (n-l=1). Wait, n-l is 5-4=1. So, s_4 is the suffix of length 4, which is the last 4 characters of s.\n\nBut s is p_4 + s_1. Because n = 4 + 1 =5. So, s is 'abab' + 'a' = 'ababa', which is length 5.\n\nBut then, the suffix of length 4 is the last 4 characters of 'ababa', which is 'baba' → which matches s_4 being 'baba'.\n\nYes! So, that works.\n\nSo, for l=4, p_4 is 'abab', s_4 is 'baba'.\n\nNow, for l=5: n=5, so the suffix is the full string. But the problem only considers improper prefixes and suffixes, i.e., up to n-1.\n\nSo, the output is determined based on whether each given string is a prefix or suffix.\n\nSo, for each given string, we need to determine if it's a prefix (P) or a suffix (S).\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- For each l, the two strings are p_l and s_l.\n\n- Determine which is p_l and s_l.\n\n- Once all l's are processed, for each given string, check if it's p_l (if l is its length) → mark as P; else, if it's s_l (and l is its length) → mark as S.\n\nBut how do I map the given strings to their respective l's?\n\nWait, because the given strings are in arbitrary order, I need to group them by their lengths and then assign for each l which string is p_l and which is s_l.\n\nSo, the steps I can take are:\n\n1. Read all the 2n-2 strings.\n\n2. Group them by their lengths, from 1 to n-1.\n\n3. For each l, collect the two strings of that length.\n\n4. For each l, determine which string is p_l and which is s_l, ensuring that p_l is a prefix of s and s_l is a suffix of s.\n\nBut the problem is, how to determine p_l and s_l for each l.\n\nAn alternative idea is to find the correct s, which is built by combining the prefixes and suffixes, and then for each given string, determine if it's a prefix or suffix of s.\n\nBut how do I find s?\n\nBecause s must be the concatenation of p_l and s_{n-l}, for each l. Wait, no, because s is the same for all l.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct s can be built by taking the prefix of length l and the suffix of length (n-l) such that their concatenation forms a consistent s.\n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\n- For each l, the two strings of length l are candidates for p_l and s_l.\n\n- Try all possible combinations of assigning p_l and s_l, ensuring that the resulting s is consistent across all l.\n\nBut for n=100, that's not feasible.\n\nWait, but for l=1, p_1 must equal s_1. So, that's a starting point.\n\nOnce l=1 is fixed, for l=2, p_2 must start with p_1, and s_2 must end with s_1 (which is p_1). So, for l=2, among the two strings, one must start with p_1, and the other must end with p_1.\n\nOnce that's determined, for l=3, p_3 must start with p_2, and s_3 must end with s_2. But s_2 is the suffix of length 2, which is known once l=2 is determined.\n\nWait, perhaps this can be done step by step.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nInitialize:\n\n- For l=1, the two strings are the same (since p_1 and s_1 must be the same). So, set p_1 = s_1 = string1.\n\nFor l >=2:\n\n- For each l, among the two strings of length l, one must be a prefix (p_l) and the other a suffix (s_l).\n\n- p_l must start with p_{l-1}.\n\n- s_l must end with s_{l-1}.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings can be tried in both orders to see which assignment satisfies the above conditions.\n\nOnce an assignment is found, proceed to the next l.\n\nBut for n=100, this approach could be time-consuming. However, since n is small (up to 100), it's manageable.\n\nSo, the algorithm in code could be:\n\nRead all strings, group by length.\n\nFor l from 1 to n-1:\n\n   if l == 1:\n\n      p_l and s_l must be the same string.\n\n   else:\n\n      for the two strings in group l:\n\n         try assigning str1 as p_l and str2 as s_l.\n\n             check if p_l starts with p_prev.\n\n             check if s_l ends with s_prev.\n\n             if both conditions are met, proceed.\n\n         else:\n\n             try assigning str2 as p_l and str1 as s_l.\n\n             check same conditions.\n\n             if both met, proceed.\n\n      if neither assignment works, return error (but problem says it's always possible).\n\nOnce p_l and s_l are determined for all l, the correct s is p_{n-1} + s_1.\n\nWait, no. Because s is built as p_1 followed by s_{n-1}, which is the suffix of length n-1.\n\nWait, for example, for l=4 and n=5, s is p_4 (length 4) + s_1 (length 1), forming s of length 5.\n\nWait, but earlier steps have determined s_4 as the suffix of length 4, which is 'baba' in the sample.\n\nWait, but s is p_4 + s_{n-l} where n-l=1. So, s is p_4 + s_1.\n\nSo, the full s is the concatenation of p_l (length l) and s_{n-l} (length n-l).\n\nBut for l=4, n-l=1, so s_4 is the suffix of length 4, which is 'baba', and s_1 is 'a'. So, s is 'abab' + 'a' = 'ababa'.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut for higher l, it's more complex.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each l, determine p_l and s_l.\n\n2. Once all p_l and s_l are known, construct s as p_1 + s_{n-1}.\n\nBecause, for l=1, s is p_1 (length 1) + s_{n-1} (length n-1), which is s of length n.\n\nWait, but for l=1, s is p_1 (length 1) + s_{n-1} (length n-1). So, the full s is p_1 followed by s_{n-1}.\n\nOnce s is constructed, all p_l and s_l can be verified.\n\nOnce s is known, the next step is to assign each given string as P or S.\n\nTo do that, for each string in the input:\n\n- Find its length l.\n\n- If it's equal to p_l, then it's a prefix (mark 'P').\n\n- Else, if it's equal to s_l, then it's a suffix (mark 'S').\n\nBut wait, because for each l, the two strings are p_l and s_l. So, each string is either p_l or s_l for some l.\n\nSo, after determining p_l and s_l for all l, we can map each given string to whether it's a prefix or suffix.\n\nSo, the steps in code would be:\n\n- Read all the strings into a list.\n\n- Group them by their lengths.\n\n- For l from 1 to n-1:\n\n   if l ==1:\n\n      p_l and s_l are the same string.\n\n   else:\n\n      for each possible assignment of the two strings as (p_l, s_l):\n\n          check if p_l starts with p_{l-1}.\n\n          check if s_l ends with s_{l-1}.\n\n          if both conditions are met, proceed with this assignment.\n\nOnce all p_l and s_l are determined, build s as p_1 + s_{n-1}.\n\nOnce s is built, for each given string:\n\n   if it's equal to p_l for its length l → mark 'P'.\n\n   else → mark 'S'.\n\nSo, the crux is to correctly determine p_l and s_l for each l.\n\nNow, the question is: How to implement this in code.\n\nLet's outline the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead all the strings, stripping newlines.\n\nGroup the strings by their lengths into a dictionary, say groups, where groups[l] is a list of two strings.\n\nFor l in 1..n-1:\n\n   if len(groups[l]) != 2:\n\n       raise error, but problem says it's correct.\n\nNow, initialize:\n\nprev_p = None\n\nprev_s = None\n\nfor l in 1 to n-1:\n\n   if l ==1:\n\n       # p_1 and s_1 must be the same.\n\n       # So, the two strings in groups[1] are same.\n\n       assert len(groups[1]) ==2 and groups[1][0] == groups[1][1]\n\n       prev_p = groups[1][0]\n\n       prev_s = groups[1][0]\n\n   else:\n\n       # get the two strings.\n\n       str1, str2 = groups[l]\n\n       # try both possibilities: str1 as p_l, str2 as s_l.\n\n       # check if p_l starts with prev_p.\n\n       # and s_l ends with prev_s.\n\n       if str1.startswith(prev_p) and str2.endswith(prev_s):\n\n           prev_p = str1\n\n           prev_s = str2\n\n       else:\n\n           # try the other way.\n\n           if str2.startswith(prev_p) and str1.endswith(prev_s):\n\n               prev_p = str2\n\n               prev_s = str1\n\n           else:\n\n               # something's wrong.\n\n               # but problem says it's possible.\n\n               pass\n\nOnce all l are processed, build s as prev_p + prev_s.\n\nWait, no. Because for l=1, prev_p is p_1, and for the next l, n-l is 5-1=4, so the suffix is s_4.\n\nBut when building s, it's p_1 followed by s_{n-1}.\n\nWait, perhaps the s is built as p_1 followed by s_{n-1}.\n\nWait, in the first sample:\n\np_1 is 'a', s_{n-1} is s_4 = 'baba'. So, s is 'a' + 'baba' = 'ababa'.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for general l, the suffix s_l is of length l, but for building s, it's p_1 followed by s_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the code should compute s as p_1 + s_{n-1}.\n\nWait, but how do I know s_{n-1}? Because for l=n-1, the suffix s_{n-1} is determined.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nOnce all p_l and s_l are determined, s is p_1 + s_{n-1}.\n\nOnce s is built, for each string in the input, determine whether it's a prefix or suffix.\n\nWait, but the given strings are the same as the p_l and",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine for each of the given strings whether it is a prefix or a suffix of the original string `s` of length `n`.
