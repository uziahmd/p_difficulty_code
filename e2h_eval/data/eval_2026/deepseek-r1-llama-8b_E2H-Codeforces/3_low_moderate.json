Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Vanya is walking along a street lit by lanterns, and I have to find the minimal radius d such that all points on the street are covered. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each lantern lights a segment of the street from (ai - d) to (ai + d), but considering the boundaries. So for each lantern, the coverage starts at max(0, ai -d) and ends at min(l, ai +d). The goal is to choose d as small as possible so that the union of all these intervals covers the entire [0, l] interval.\n\nHmm, so how do I model this? Well, maybe I can think about the street as being divided into segments covered by each lantern. But since the lanterns can be placed in any order, perhaps it's better to sort them first. Because if two lanterns are close together, their combined coverage might cover more, but if they're apart, they might leave gaps.\n\nWait, maybe the optimal d is determined by the maximum distance between consecutive points after sorting. But wait, no, because each lantern contributes its own range, not just two endpoints. So perhaps the minimal d is determined by the maximum gap between the right end of one lantern's coverage and the left end of the next.\n\nSo here's an idea: sort all the lantern positions. Then, for each adjacent pair of lanterns, calculate the distance between their coverage areas. The required d must be such that the sum of their individual radii is at least the distance between them. Wait, no—because each lantern's coverage is determined by d. So the point is, between two lanterns, say at positions x and y (x < y), the maximum gap between the right end of the first and the left end of the second is y - (x + 2d). Wait, no, the first's coverage is up to x + d, and the second's starts at y - d. So the gap between them is (y - d) - (x + d) = y - x - 2d. For the entire street to be covered, this gap must be <=0. So y - x - 2d <=0 → d >= (y -x)/2. So for each pair, the minimal d is at least half the distance between them. Also, the first lantern needs to cover from 0 to some point, and the last lantern needs to cover up to l.\n\nWait, but also, the first lantern's left coverage is max(0, a1 -d) which should be <=0, but that's only if a1 is the first lantern. Oh, no, wait: no, the first lantern's coverage starts at a1 -d, but since the street starts at 0, the coverage could extend beyond 0. But for the entire street to be covered, the leftmost point is 0, so the first lantern's coverage must cover up to 0. Or wait, maybe not. Because if a lantern is at 0, then its coverage starts at 0. But if another lantern is at a higher position, then perhaps the first doesn't need to reach 0.\n\nWait, no. The entire street [0, l] must be covered. So the left end (0) must be covered by at least one lantern, and the right end (l) must be covered by at least one lantern.\n\nSo, for the left end, the earliest lantern must have a_i -d <=0, but since a_i could be less than or equal to 0, but wait the input constraints say 0 ≤ ai ≤ l. So if there's a lantern at 0, then 0 -d is ≤0, so that's fine. If no lantern is at 0, then the nearest lantern to the left of 0 is impossible because all are at ≥0. So in that case, the lantern closest to 0 must have a_i -d ≤0. So for the first lantern, which is the leftmost, we have a_0 -d ≤0 → d ≥a_0. Because a_0 is the smallest a_i.\n\nSimilarly, for the right end l, the last lantern's a_n-1 +d must be ≥l → d ≥ l - a_n-1.\n\nSo the minimal d must satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. d ≥ (max gap between consecutive lanterns) / 2. Because for each pair of adjacent lanterns, the gap between their coverage must be ≤0.\n\n2. d must be ≥ a_0 (so that the first lantern covers 0).\n\n3. d must be ≥ l - a_{n-1} (so that the last lantern covers l).\n\nWait, but condition 2 and 3 might be superseded by condition 1. For example, if a_0 is large, then the first pair (from ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns on a street of length \\( l \\) cover the entire street. Each lantern lights a segment of the street from \\( a_i - d \\) to \\( a_i + d \\), where \\( a_i \\) is the position of the \\( i \\)-th lantern.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lanterns**: First, sort the positions of the lanterns. This helps in efficiently determining the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Coverage Gaps**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, calculate the gap between their coverage areas. The minimal \\( d \\) must be at least half of the largest gap between any two consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Edge Cases**: Ensure that the first lantern covers the start of the street (0) and the last lantern covers the end of the street (l). This translates to checking if \\( d \\) is at least the position of the first lantern and the difference between \\( l \\) and the position of the last lantern.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n\n    # Read input\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    ai = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    # Sort the lantern positions\n    ai.sort()\n    \n    # Check if no lanterns are present (though constraints say n >=1)\n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n    \n    # Initial possible d is the maximum of a[0] and (l - a[-1])\n    d_min = max(ai[0], l - ai[-1])\n    \n    # Check all adjacent pairs for the maximum required d\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        current = ai[i]\n        next_ = ai[i+1]\n        gap = next_ - current\n        required_d = (gap) / 2.0\n        if required_d > d_min:\n            d_min = required_d\n    \n    # Print with sufficient precision\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d_min))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of lanterns \\( n \\) and the length of the street \\( l \\), followed by the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Initial Check**: The initial value of \\( d \\) is set to the maximum of the first lantern's position (to cover the start of the street) and the difference between the street length and the last lantern's position (to cover the end of the street).\n4. **Gap Calculation**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the gap between their coverage areas is calculated. The required \\( d \\) must be at least half of the largest gap found.\n5. **Output**: The minimum \\( d \\) is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach ensures that all parts of the street are covered with the smallest possible light radius \\( d \\).",
