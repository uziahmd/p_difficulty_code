The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where Neko found some treasure chests and keys, and needs to open as many chests as possible. The way it works is that each key can unlock a chest if the sum of their numbers is odd. Hmm, right.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step. Each chest has a number a_i, each key has b_j. For a key j to unlock chest i, a_i + b_j must be congruent to 1 mod 2. So, that means one is even and the other is odd. Because adding two odds gives even, adding two evens gives even, but an even plus odd is odd.\n\nWait, wait. Let's see: if a_i is even, then b_j must be odd for a_i + b_j to be odd. Or if a_i is odd, then b_j must be even. Oh right, because even + odd = odd, which is 1 mod 2. So the condition depends on the parity of a_i and b_j.\n\nSo the first thing I need to do is count how many a_i are even and how many are odd. Similarly for the b_j. Because the matching between keys and chests depends on their parities.\n\nLet me think: suppose I have E_a even chests, O_a odd chests. And among the keys, E_b even and O_b odd.\n\nThen, for a key to match with a chest:\n\n- An even key (E_b) can only unlock an odd chest (O_a). Because even + odd = odd.\n- An odd key (O_b) can only unlock an even chest (E_a). Because odd + even = odd.\n\nSo the maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by how we pair these.\n\nBut wait, the constraints are that each key can be used once, and each chest can be used once. So we need to find the maximum matching between the available keys and chests based on their parities.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd a_i's.\n2. Count the number of even and odd b_j's.\n3. Then, calculate how many pairs can be formed considering the possible combinations.\n\nThe possible pairs are:\n\nCase 1: Even key (E_b) matches with odd chest (O_a). So the number of such pairs is min(E_b, O_a).\n\nCase 2: Odd key (O_b) matches with even chest (E_a). The number of such pairs is min(O_b, E_a).\n\nBut wait, is that all? No, because the keys can be used in any order, but each key can only be used once, and each chest can be used once.\n\nWait, no. Because after choosing a certain number of pairs from case 1 and case 2, the remaining can't be used anymore. So the total maximum is the sum of the minimums of each case, but with the constraint that the sum doesn't exceed the minimum of n and m.\n\nHmm, no. Because the sum of the two cases could potentially be up to min(n, m), but sometimes they may not reach that.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each key is used once, each chest once. So for each key, it's either used in case 1 or case 2 or not used at all. But since the goal is to maximize the number of chests, we want to use as many keys as possible.\n\nBut perhaps the maximum number of chests is the sum of the two possible pairings, but also ensuring that we don't exceed the total number of keys or the total number of chests.\n\nWait, but each pairing uses one key and one chest. So the sum of the two pairings can't be more than the minimum of n and m.\n\nWait, no. Because each pairing uses a key and a chest, but maybe the sum of the two pairings is more than n or m. So what's the correct way?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of chests is the minimum between:\n\na) The sum of case1 and case2.\n\nb) The total number of chests (n).\n\nBecause you can't have more chests opened than exist.\n\nBut wait, the sum of case1 and case2 can't exceed both the number of keys and the number of chests. Because each case uses a key and a chest.\n\nSo the maximum possible is the minimum of (case1 + case2, min(m, n)).\n\nWait, no. Because case1 is min(E_b, O_a), case2 is min(O_b, E_a). So adding them together could give a value larger than min(m, n), but that's impossible because each pairing uses a key and a chest.\n\nWait, no. Because for each key used in case1, you have to subtract from the total keys available. Similarly for case2.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nThe maximum possible is the minimum between:\n\nsum_case = case1 + case2\n\nsum_case can't be more than m, because each case uses a key.\n\nsum_case can't be more than n, because each case uses a chest.\n\nSo the maximum chests is the minimum between sum_case and min(m, n).\n\nWait, but sum_case is already the sum of the possible pairings. So perhaps the maximum is min(sum_case, min(m, n)).\n\nWait, no. Because sum_case could be, for example, 10, but n is 15, m is 15. So the maximum is 10, but if there are enough chests.\n\nWait, no, because the sum_case is the maximum possible pairings, but the actual maximum chests opened is the minimum between sum_case and n.\n\nWait, because each pairing uses a chest, so the total chests opened can't exceed n.\n\nSo the formula would be:\n\nmax_chests = min( case1 + case2, min(m, n) )\n\nWait, but wait, case1 is min(E_b, O_a) → which is the number of keys that can be used in case1. Similarly, case2 is min(O_b, E_a). So the total used keys is case1 + case2, which can't exceed m.\n\nSimilarly, the total used chests is case1 + case2, which can't exceed n.\n\nSo the maximum is the minimum between case1 + case2 and the minimum of m and n.\n\nWait, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute E_a = number of a_i that are even.\n\n   O_a = number of a_i that are odd.\n\n   Similarly for b_j: E_b, O_b.\n\n2. case1 = min(E_b, O_a): using even keys on odd chests.\n\n3. case2 = min(O_b, E_a): using odd keys on even chests.\n\n4. total_possible = case1 + case2.\n\n5. max_chest = min(total_possible, min(n, m)).\n\nBecause you can't have more chests than the total number of keys, and you can't have more than the number of chests.\n\nWait, but let me test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=5, m=4\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11] → a_i's.\n\nLet me compute a_i's even/odd:\n\n9 → odd\n\n14 → even\n\n6 → even\n\n2 → even\n\n11 → odd.\n\nSo E_a = 3 (14,6,2), O_a = 2 (9,11).\n\nb = [8,4,7,20] → b_j's.\n\n8 is even, 4 even,7 odd, 20 even.\n\nE_b = 3 (8,4,20), O_b = 1 (7).\n\ncase1: min(E_b, O_a) = min(3,2)=2.\n\ncase2: min(O_b, E_a) = min(1,3)=1.\n\ntotal_possible = 2+1=3.\n\nmin(n,m) is 4. So 3 <=4 → max_chest is 3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nn=5, m=1.\n\na = [2,4,6,8,10] → all even. E_a=5, O_a=0.\n\nb = [5] → odd. E_b=0, O_b=1.\n\ncase1: min(0,0)=0.\n\ncase2: min(1,5)=1.\n\ntotal_possible=1.\n\nmin(n, m)=1.\n\nSo max_chest is 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\nn=1, m=4.\n\na is 10 → even.\n\nb is [20,30,40,50] → all even.\n\nSo E_a=1, O_a=0.\n\nE_b=4, O_b=0.\n\ncase1: min(4,0)=0.\n\ncase2: min(0,1)=0.\n\nTotal_possible=0.\n\nmin(n,m)=1. So 0 is the answer.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the logic seems to work.\n\nNow, the plan for the code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list a.\n\nCompute E_a and O_a.\n\nRead list b.\n\nCompute E_b and O_b.\n\nCompute case1 = min(E_b, O_a).\n\ncase2 = min(O_b, E_a).\n\ntotal_possible = case1 + case2.\n\nmax_chest = min(total_possible, min(n, m)).\n\nPrint max_chest.\n\nWait, but what about when the sum exceeds the minimum of n and m? Because the sum could be larger than the smaller of the two.\n\nFor example, say n=3, m=5.\n\nE_a=3, O_a=0.\n\nE_b=3, O_b=2.\n\ncase1: min(3,0)=0.\n\ncase2: min(2,3)=2.\n\nsum is 2.\n\nmin(n,m) is 3.\n\nso max_chest is min(2,3) → 2.\n\nWhich is correct because we can only use 2 chests.\n\nAnother example: n=5, m=5.\n\nE_a=3, O_a=2.\n\nE_b=4, O_b=1.\n\ncase1: min(4,2)=2.\n\ncase2: min(1,3)=1.\n\nsum is 3.\n\nmin(n,m)=5.\n\nso max_chest is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo yes, the logic holds.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, in Python, read n, m.\n\nThen read a list, count even and odd.\n\nSame for b.\n\nCompute case1 and case2.\n\nSum and take min with min(n, m).\n\nSo the code would look like this:\n\nRead n, m.\n\na = list of a_i.\n\nb = list of b_j.\n\ncount_even_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n\ncount_odd_a = n - count_even_a\n\ncount_even_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n\ncount_odd_b = m - count_even_b\n\ncase1 = min(count_even_b, count_odd_a)\n\ncase2 = min(count_odd_b, count_even_a)\n\ntotal = case1 + case2\n\nmax_chest = min(total, min(n, m))\n\nprint(max_chest)\n\nYes, that should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the samples:\n\nSample 1:\n\na has 3 even, 2 odd.\n\nb has 3 even, 1 odd.\n\ncase1: min(3,2) =2.\n\ncase2: min(1,3)=1.\n\ntotal=3.\n\nmin(n, m)=4.\n\nSo 3.\n\nSample2:\n\na all even, 5.\n\nb: 0 even,1 odd.\n\ncase1: min(0,0)=0.\n\ncase2: min(1,5)=1.\n\ntotal=1.\n\nmin(n,m)=1.\n\nSample3:\n\na even:1.\n\nb even:4.\n\ncase1: min(4,0)=0.\n\ncase2: min(0,1)=0.\n\ntotal=0.\n\nSo code should print 0.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys.
