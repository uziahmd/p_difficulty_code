After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the number of successful students in a group. A student is considered successful if there's at least one subject where they are the best. Being the best means that no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\nHmm, so for each subject, I need to determine which student has the maximum mark. Then, for each student, check if they are the maximum in any subject.\n\nLet me think about the steps I need to take.\n\nFirst, I'll read the input. The input starts with two integers n and m. Then there are n lines, each representing a student's grades for m subjects. Each line is a string of m characters, each being a digit from 1 to 9.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nEach of the three lines represents a student's marks in three subjects.\n\nFor each subject, I need to find the maximum mark. Then, for each student, see if any of their marks equals that maximum.\n\nWait, but more precisely, for each subject, the student who has the highest mark is the best in that subject. So for each subject, only one student can be the best. And a student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject.\n\nSo my plan is as follows:\n\n1. For each subject (from 0 to m-1), find the maximum mark among all students.\n2. For each student, check if in any of the subjects, their mark is equal to the maximum for that subject.\n3. Count how many students meet this condition.\n\nThat makes sense. Now, how to implement this.\n\nLet's break it down.\n\nFirst, reading the input correctly. The input is given as a single string, perhaps? Or as separate lines. Wait, looking at the input format:\n\nThe first line is 'n m' as two integers. Then next n lines each have m characters, each being a number from 1-9.\n\nWait, the input description says: next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. So each line is a string of length m, like \"223\" for m=3.\n\nSo for each student, their data is a string of m digits.\n\nSo, for processing, I can represent each student's marks as a list of integers or just as a string.\n\nBut since comparing characters is same as comparing their numeric values, maybe it's easier to process them as strings.\n\nWait, in Python, '9' > '8' is True, so we can compare the characters directly. That might save some conversion steps.\n\nSo, for each subject, I can iterate through all students and collect their marks for that subject. Then find the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, for each subject j (0 to m-1), loop through all students, get the j-th character of their string, and track the maximum.\n\nOnce I have the maximum for each subject, I can then for each student check if any of their j-th character is equal to the maximum for that j.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string of length m.\n\nFor each subject j in 0..m-1:\n\n   max_mark = -infinity\n   for each student in students:\n       current_mark = student[j]\n       if current_mark > max_mark:\n           max_mark = current_mark\n   store max_mark for subject j.\n\nThen, for each student, check if for any j, their j-th character is equal to the max_mark for subject j.\n\nCount the number of students where this is true.\n\nThat's the approach.\n\nNow, thinking about data structures.\n\nWe can represent the students as a list of strings. Each string is their marks for the subjects.\n\nThen, for each subject j, we can compute the maximum mark.\n\nLet's code this step by step.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    s = input().strip()\n    students.append(s)\n\nmax_marks = []  # list where max_marks[j] is the maximum for subject j\nfor j in range(m):\n    current_max = -1  # since marks are from 1 to 9\n    for s in students:\n        c = s[j]\n        if c > str(current_max):\n            current_max = c\n    max_marks.append(current_max)\n\ncount = 0\nfor s in students:\n    is_successful = False\n    for j in range(m):\n        if s[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            is_successful = True\n            break\n    if is_successful:\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but wait. What about when the max_marks are stored as strings, and the student's marks are compared as strings. So for example, for j=0, if the max is '9', then any student who has '9' in that position is considered.\n\nYes, because in the comparison, '9' > '8' etc., so the code should work.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nSo students are [\"223\", \"232\", \"112\"]\n\nFor subject 0 (first character):\n\nStudents' marks are 2,2,1.\n\nMax is 2.\n\nSubject 0's max is '2'.\n\nSubject 1 (second character):\n\nMarks are 2,3,1. Max is 3.\n\nSubject 2 (third character):\n\nMarks are 3,2,2. Max is 3.\n\nSo max_marks is ['2', '3', '3'].\n\nNow, for each student:\n\nStudent 0: '223'\n\nCheck each subject:\n\nj=0: '2' == '2' → yes. So successful.\n\nj=1: '2' vs '3' → no.\n\nj=2: '3' == '3' → yes. So overall, student 0 is successful.\n\nStudent 1: '232'\n\nj=0: '2' == '2' → yes. Successful.\n\nj=1: '3' == '3' → yes. Also successful.\n\nStudent 2: '112'\n\nj=0: '1' < '2' → no.\n\nj=1: '1' < '3' → no.\n\nj=2: '2' < '3' → no.\n\nSo only 2 students are successful. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n['3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\nWait, the input is written as ['3 5\\n...', ...], but in reality, the input would be read as two lines: first line '3 5' then next three lines.\n\nIn the sample input, the second line is '91728' which is 5 characters, right?\n\nSo the students are:\n\n\"91728\"\n\n\"11828\"\n\n\"11111\"\n\nFor each subject:\n\nSubject 0: 9,1,1 → max is 9.\n\nSubject 1: 1,1,1 → max is 1.\n\nSubject 2:7,8,1 → max is 8.\n\nSubject3:2,8,1 → max is 8.\n\nSubject4:8,8,1 → max is 8.\n\nSo max_marks are ['9','1','8','8','8'].\n\nNow, for each student:\n\nStudent 0: '91728'\n\nCheck each subject:\n\nj=0: 9 ==9 → yes. So successful.\n\nStudent1: '11828'\n\nj=0: 1 <9 → no.\n\nj=1:1 ==1 → yes. So successful.\n\nStudent2: '11111'\n\nj=0:1<9 → no.\n\nj=1:1 ==1 → yes. Successful.\n\nSo all three students are successful. Hence, output is 3.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where all students have the same marks in all subjects: e.g., n=2, m=2, both students have \"99\". Then for each subject, the max is '9'. Each student is the best in both subjects, so both are successful. So output is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=1. Only one student, so he is best in subject 0. Output is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2.\n\nStudent1: 11\n\nStudent2: 22.\n\nFor subject 0: max is 2.\n\nStudent1's 0th mark is 1 <2 → not best.\n\nSubject1: max is 2.\n\nSame.\n\nSo Student1 is not successful. Student2 is best in both, so counts. So output is 1.\n\nWait, no: student2 is best in both, so he is successful.\n\nSo code would return 1.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when a student's mark is the same as another's, but neither is the max?\n\nLike n=3, m=1.\n\nStudents: [ '2', '2', '1' ]\n\nmax is 2. So students 0 and 1 are best. So both are successful.\n\nSo code would count 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Are the students processed correctly as strings, or do we need to convert to integers? In our code, we're comparing the characters as strings, which works because '9' is larger than '8', etc. So no problem.\n\nWhat about leading zeros? But according to the problem statement, marks are from 1 to 9, so no leading zeros. So each character is between '1' and '9'.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, writing the code accordingly.\n\nI'll structure the code as follows:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead n lines, stripping any whitespace (like newlines), and store as a list called students.\n\nCompute max_marks for each subject j.\n\nThen, for each student, check if any subject j has their mark equal to max_marks[j]. If yes, increment count.\n\nFinally, print the count.\n\nSo the code would be as I wrote earlier.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first line is given as a string, like '3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112'—so perhaps the entire input is a single string? Or is it split into lines?\n\nNo, the problem statement says the first line is two integers, then n lines follow. So the code reads n, m from the first line, then reads n lines.\n\nIn the sample input, the input is shown as ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111'], which suggests that perhaps the input is a list of multiple lines. But in reality, in a programming competition, the input is read via stdin, which is read as a single stream. So the code should read the first line, then n lines.\n\nSo the code should be okay.\n\nTesting the code with the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nOutput is 2.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nOutput is 3.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, m=1.\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n9\n\nOutput: 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2.\n\nInput:\n\n2 2\n\n11\n\n22\n\nOutput: 1.\n\nBecause student 1 is best in subject 0 (2>1?), no, wait:\n\nWait, no, for subject 0, the marks are '1' and '2'. So max is 2.\n\nSo student 1 is not the best in any subject.\n\nOnly student 2 is best in both, so count is 1.\n\nThus, the code will output 1.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: First, read the number of students `n` and the number of subjects `m`. Then, read the marks for each student.\n2. **Identify Best Marks per Subject**: For each subject, determine the highest mark achieved by any student. This will help us identify which student is the best in each subject.\n3. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they are the best in any subject by comparing their marks with the highest marks identified in step 2.\n4. **Count Successful Students**: Count how many students are successful based on the results from step 3.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nmax_marks = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    current_max = '0'\n    for s in students:\n        if s[j] > current_max:\n            current_max = s[j]\n    max_marks.append(current_max)\n\ncount = 0\nfor s in students:\n    is_successful = False\n    for j in range(m):\n        if s[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            is_successful = True\n            break\n    if is_successful:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and stored where `students` is a list of strings, each representing a student's marks across subjects.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (from 0 to m-1), iterate through each student's marks to find the maximum mark. This gives us an array `max_marks` where each entry corresponds to the highest mark in that subject.\n3. **Checking Success**: For each student, check each subject to see if their mark matches the maximum mark for that subject. If they match in any subject, the student is marked as successful.\n4. **Counting Successes**: Maintain a count of how many students are successful and print this count at the end.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the number of successful students by leveraging direct comparisons and iterating through the data in a structured manner.",
