Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a regular polygon, each internal angle can be calculated. The formula for the internal angle of a regular n-gon is (n-2)*180 / n degrees. But wait, that's the internal angle. But when forming an angle with three vertices, how does that translate?\n\nWait, no, the problem is about creating an angle by selecting three points v1, v2, v3. The angle is formed at v2, between the two lines from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. So I need to find the possible angles that can be formed by any triplet of vertices in the polygon.\n\nBut since the polygon is regular, the positions of the vertices are symmetric. So maybe there's a pattern or optimal way to choose these points.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the regular polygon. Each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. The central angle between consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees. So the arc between any two adjacent vertices is 360/n.\n\nWhen you pick three vertices, say v1, v2, v3, they form a triangle. The angle at v2 depends on the arcs subtended by v1 and v3 relative to v2.\n\nWait, in a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So for the angle at v2, the angle formed is equal to half the measure of the arc that's opposite to it, which is the arc from v1 to v3 passing through the points not including v2.\n\nWait, maybe I should draw this. Suppose the polygon is a regular n-gon inscribed in a unit circle. Then the central angle between consecutive vertices is 2π/n radians. So, if I have three points A, B, C, the angle at B is determined by the arcs AB and BC, but wait, no— the angle at B would be determined by the arc AC that doesn't contain B. Because the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.\n\nSo, for example, in a square (n=4), each side corresponds to 90 degrees. If I take points 1, 2, and 3, the angle at 2 is formed by the arc from 1 to 3, which is 180 degrees, so the angle is 90 degrees. Similarly, if I take points 1, 2, 4, the arc from 1 to 4 is 270 degrees? Wait, no, because in a square, moving clockwise from 1 to 2 is 90, 2 to 3 another 90, etc. So from 1 to 4, going the other way around, it's 270 degrees, but the shorter arc is 90 degrees. Wait, but the inscribed angle uses the opposite arc. So for points 1, 2, 4: the angle at 2 is the angle between 2-1 and 2-4. The arc opposite to this angle is from 1 to 4, which is 270 degrees. So the inscribed angle is 135 degrees. Hmm, but that's different from what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The angle at vertex B is equal to half the measure of the arc that is not containing B. Or wait, maybe it's half the measure of the arc that is opposite to the angle. So if the three points are arranged such that the arc between A and C (not passing through B) is 'k' degrees, then the angle at B is k/2.\n\nWait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Suppose I have points A, B, C arranged in order on the circumference. Then the angle at B is the angle between BA and BC. The intercepted arc is the arc AC that doesn't include B. So the angle is half the measure of that arc. So yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for a regular n-gon, each edge corresponds to a central angle of 2π/n radians (or 360/n degrees). So the arc length between any two adjacent points is 360/n degrees.\n\nNow, to form an angle at a vertex v2, we can choose two other vertices v1 and v3 such that the arc from v1 to v3, not passing through v2, has a measure that, when halved, gives the desired angle.\n\nSo, the idea is to find triplets v1, v2, v3 where the arc from v1 to v3 (not passing through v2) is as close as possible to 2a degrees.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The solution leverages the properties of regular polygons and inscribed angles in circles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Polygon Structure**: A regular polygon has vertices equally spaced around a circle. The central angle between consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees.\n2. **Inscribed Angle Theorem**: The angle formed by three vertices (v1, v2, v3) at v2 is half the measure of the arc opposite to v2. This arc is the distance from v1 to v3 not passing through v2.\n3. **Target Arc Calculation**: To achieve an angle close to 'a' degrees at v2, the arc opposite to v2 should be approximately 2a degrees.\n4. **Finding Optimal Vertices**: We need to check all possible triplets of vertices to find the one where the angle at v2 is closest to 'a'. Due to symmetry, we can efficiently check a limited set of candidates around each vertex.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\n\nbest_diff = float('inf')\nbest_v2 = -1\nbest_v1 = -1\nbest_v3 = -1\n\nfor v2 in range(1, n+1):\n    for k in range(-2, 3):  # Check 2 positions before and after\n        if v2 + k < 1 or v2 + k > n:\n            continue\n        for d in range(1, n):\n            if v2 + d == v2 or v2 + d == v2 + k:\n                continue\n            arc = abs((v2 + d) - (v2 + k)) * (360 / n)\n            angle = arc / 2\n            current_diff = abs(angle - a)\n            if current_diff < best_diff or (current_diff == best_diff and (v1, v2, v3) < (best_v1, best_v2, best_v3)):\n                best_diff = current_diff\n                best_v2 = v2\n                v1 = v2 + k\n                v3 = v2 + d\n                if v1 > v3:\n                    v1, v3 = v3, v1\n\nprint(f\"{v1} {best_v2} {v3}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Iterate Over Each Vertex as v2**: For each vertex, consider it as the vertex where the angle will be formed.\n2. **Check Nearby Vertices**: For each v2, check the vertices that are 1, 2, and 3 positions away in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions to form potential triplets (v1, v2, v3).\n3. **Calculate Arc and Angle**: For each triplet, calculate the arc between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2) and determine the angle at v2 using the inscribed angle theorem.\n4. **Track Best Match**: Keep track of the triplet that results in the angle closest to 'a'. If multiple triplets have the same minimal difference, any can be chosen.\n5. **Output the Result**: Print the indices of the vertices forming the optimal angle.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore all potential triplets while leveraging the symmetry and properties of regular polygons to minimize unnecessary computations.",
