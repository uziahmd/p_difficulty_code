Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to check if the pile of letters can exactly form the two names given. Hmm, right.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again. Oh right, the input consists of three lines: guest's name, host's name, and the pile. We need to check if the pile is a rearrangement of all the letters from both names combined, without any extra letters.\n\nSo, the approach here is probably to count the frequency of each letter in the guest and host names, combine them, and then compare with the frequency counts from the pile. If they match exactly, output YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, but how do I handle case sensitivity? The problem says all lines are uppercase letters, so no issues there.\n\nFirst step: Read the three lines of input. So, in Python, I can read them using input().strip() for each line.\n\nThen, I need to concatenate the guest and host names into one string. Then, create a frequency dictionary for each character in this concatenated string.\n\nSimilarly, create a frequency dictionary for the pile string.\n\nOnce I have both frequency dictionaries, I can compare them. If they are identical, output YES; else, NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the order? Oh, no, because we're comparing the counts, not the order. So that's fine.\n\nSo, how to implement this in Python?\n\nI think the collections.Counter class can be helpful here. It creates a hash map of element counts.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Read the three lines: guest, host, pile.\n2. Concatenate guest + host to get the total required letters.\n3. Create a Counter for this total.\n4. Create a Counter for the pile.\n5. Compare the two Counters. If they are equal, print YES; else, NO.\n\nThat sounds straightforward.\n\nBut wait, what about edge cases?\n\nLike, what if the pile has the same letters but in different order? Well, the Counter would handle that since it doesn't care about the order, just the counts.\n\nWhat if the total length of guest and host is not equal to the pile's length? That's an easy early check. Because if the lengths don't match, it's impossible. So perhaps first compare len(guest + host) == len(pile). If not, immediately return NO.\n\nYes, that could save some computation time, especially for larger inputs, but since the maximum length is 100, it's negligible.\n\nAnother thing: What if the guest or host is empty? But the problem states that all lines are not empty, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nSample Input 1:\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the guest is the first line, host the second, and pile the third. So, when we concatenate guest and host, their letters are combined.\n\nIn the first sample, the pile has exactly all the letters from guest and host. So the code should output YES.\n\nIn the second sample, the pile is missing a 'P' and has an extra 'L'. So the counts don't match, output NO.\n\nThird sample: There's an extra 'L', so counts differ, output NO.\n\nSo, the code should correctly handle these cases.\n\nNow, let's think about possible errors.\n\nWhat if the pile has more letters than needed? Like, extra letters. The Counter will have higher counts for those letters, so the comparison will catch that.\n\nAnother point: The guest and host names may contain repeated letters, but as long as their combined counts match the pile's, it's correct.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nRead the three lines:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nCombine guest and host:\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nCreate Counters:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\ncounter_combined = Counter(combined)\ncounter_pile = Counter(pile)\n\nCompare:\n\nif counter_combined == counter_pile:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, that's all? It seems too simple, but yes.\n\nWait, but waitâ€”what about the possibility that the sum of the lengths of guest and host is different from the pile's length?\n\nBecause in such a case, even if the letters are a subset, the overall length won't match, so the Counters will also differ. So including the length check is redundant, but adding it might make the code slightly more efficient. Or, perhaps not necessary, but it's not harmful.\n\nFor example, if guest and host together have 10 letters, and pile has 11 letters, then the Counters can't be equal. So the initial check can quickly return NO.\n\nBut in code, it's optional.\n\nAlternatively, the Counter equality will naturally include the length, because each character's count contributes to the total length. So, if the lengths are different, the counters will not be equal, so the code will correctly output NO.\n\nThus, the code can proceed as written.\n\nTesting against the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\nAfter combining guest and host, the total letters should match the pile's letters.\n\nSample Output: YES.\n\nSecond sample: Pile has an extra 'L' and missing 'P', so counters differ.\n\nThird sample: Extra 'L', so counters differ.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nBut wait, in Python, when using input(), the newline characters at the end of each line are included? No, because the strip() function removes whitespace, including newlines.\n\nWait, no. Wait, input() reads until the newline, but the newline is not included in the string. So, for each line, the actual content is everything before the newline.\n\nSo, for example, if a line is \"AB\\ncd\", then the input() returns \"AB\" for the first line and \"cd\" for the second.\n\nWait, no. Let me test.\n\nIf the input is like:\n\nabc\ndef\n\nThen, input().strip() for the first line gives 'abc', the second gives 'def'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nThus, the final code is:\n\nRead guest, host, pile.\n\nCombine guest and host.\n\nCount the letters in both.\n\nCompare.\n\nPrint YES or NO.\n\nSo, the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the pile of letters found at the door can be rearranged to form both the guest's name and the host's name exactly. This means that the pile must contain exactly the same number of each letter as the combined names of the guest and host.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the three lines of input which include the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names:** Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Count Frequencies:** Use a frequency counter to count the occurrences of each letter in the combined names and in the pile of letters.\n4. **Compare Frequencies:** Check if the frequency counters for the combined names and the pile are identical. If they are, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the names exactly; otherwise, it cannot.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Read the three lines of input\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\n# Combine guest and host names\ncombined = guest + host\n\n# Create frequency counters for both combined names and the pile\ncounter_combined = Counter(combined)\ncounter_pile = Counter(pile)\n\n# Compare the two counters\nif counter_combined == counter_pile:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The input is read using `input().strip()` to ensure any leading or trailing whitespace (including newlines) is removed.\n- **Combining Names:** The guest's name and the host's name are concatenated to form a single string representing all the letters that should be present in the pile.\n- **Frequency Counting:** The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to create dictionaries that count the occurrences of each letter in the combined names and the pile.\n- **Comparison:** The two frequency counters are compared. If they are equal, it means every letter in the pile is used exactly once in forming the names, and there are no extra letters. If they are not equal, it indicates either a missing letter or an extra letter, hence the result is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match of letter frequencies, ensuring that the solution is both correct and optimal for the given problem constraints.",
