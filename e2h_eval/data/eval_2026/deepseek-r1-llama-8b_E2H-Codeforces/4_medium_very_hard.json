The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this Rock-Paper-Scissors problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that Nikephoros and Polycarpus are playing n rounds of rock-paper-scissors. In each round, they choose their move from their respective sequences A and B, cycling through them. If one wins, the loser gets a red spot. We need to count how many red spots each has after n rounds.\n\nHmm, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the input gives n, then two strings A and B. Each character is 'R', 'S', or 'P'. For each of the n rounds, we determine who wins based on their current choices. Then, increment the respective counters.\n\nWait, but how do we get their choices for each round? Because the sequences are cycled. So for each i-th round, the choice for Nikephoros is A[i % m], and similarly for Polycarpus as B[i % k].\n\nSo the plan is: for each round from 0 to n-1 (since it's 0-based), determine the moves, compute the winner, and tally the red spots.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2e5, which is manageable because each step is O(1) since the string lengths are up to 1000 each. So the total operations would be about 2e5 * 2 = 4e5 steps, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n.\n2. Read A and B strings.\n3. Initialize counters for both players: nike = 0, poly = 0.\n4. For each round in 0 to n-1:\n   a. Get a_move = A[round % len(A)]\n   b. Get b_move = B[round % len(B)]\n   c. Determine who wins between a_move and b_move.\n   d. If a_move beats b_move, then Poly gets a red spot. Else if b_move beats a_move, Nike gets a spot. Else, no one.\n5. After all rounds, output the counts.\n\nNow, how to determine who wins?\n\nLet me think about the rules:\n\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Scissors beat Paper\n- Paper beats Rock\n\nWe can represent this with a function that returns True if move_a beats move_b.\n\nAlternatively, create a mapping for each move indicating what it beats.\n\nFor example:\n\nbeats = {\n    'R': 'S',\n    'S': 'P',\n    'P': 'R'\n}\n\nSo if a_move is 'R' and b_move is 'S', then a wins.\n\nWait, yes. So the logic is:\n\nif a_move == b_move: no one gets a spot.\nelse:\n   check if a_move beats b_move. If yes, then Poly gets a spot.\n   else, Nike gets a spot.\n\nSo the code can be structured as follows.\n\nImplementing the beats correctly is crucial.\n\nLet me test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n7\nRPS\nRSPP\n\nSo A is 'RPS' (length 3), B is 'RSPP' (length 4).\n\nRound 0:\nA[0] = 'R', B[0] = 'R' → same. No spots.\n\nRound 1 (i=1):\nA[1%3=1] = 'P', B[1%4=1] = 'S'.\nCheck if P beats S: yes. So Poly loses, Nike gains 1.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, if a_move is 'P' and b_move is 'S', then P beats S. So the winner is a_move (Nikephoros). So Poly gets a spot.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, in the sample explanation, the first round was R-R (no action). Second round: P vs S. So P beats S. So Poly (the loser) gets a spot. But in the note, the sample says that in that round, Nikephoros lost. Wait, no, wait.\n\nWait, the sample's explanation says:\n\nIn the first sample, the game went like this:\n\nRound 1: R - R → draw. No spot.\n\nRound 2: P - S → Nikephoros shows P, Poly shows S. So P beats S. So Poly loses, thus Poly gets a spot. So Nike's count is not incremented, Poly's is.\n\nWait no, wait. The problem statement says that the winner is the one who pinches the loser. So when a player wins, the other gets a spot.\n\nSo in each round, exactly one person may get a spot.\n\nSo in each round, if a_move beats b_move → a wins, b loses → b gets a spot.\n\nIf b_move beats a_move → b wins, a loses → a gets a spot.\n\nElse, no one.\n\nSo for each round, we have to see who wins, and add to the loser's count.\n\nSo for the sample:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → no spots.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → P beats S → so Poly (b) wins. Thus, a gets a spot (Nikephoros) → his count increases by 1.\n\nWait no: wait, a is the one who plays P, b is the one who plays S. So a's move is P, which beats S. So a wins, b loses. So b (Poly) gets a spot. So in this case, Poly's count increases by 1.\n\nSo in the sample, the second round, Poly gets a spot.\n\nBut according to the sample note, in the second round, Nikephoros lost. So that's correct.\n\nSo the logic is:\n\nfor each round, determine who wins. The winner is the one whose move beats the other. The loser is the one who gets a spot.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor each i in 0..n-1:\n\na = A[i % m]\n\nb = B[i % k]\n\nif a == b: continue\n\nelse:\n\nif a beats b:\n\npoly +=1\n\nelse:\n\nnike +=1\n\nSo now, the problem is to implement the beats correctly.\n\nSo for a given a and b, how to check if a beats b.\n\nWe can define a dictionary where each key is a move, and the value is what it beats.\n\nbeats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\nso, if beats[a] == b → a beats b.\n\nSo, for example:\n\na='R' → beats['R'] is 'S' → if b is 'S', a wins.\n\nSimilarly, a='S' beats 'P'.\n\na='P' beats 'R'.\n\nSo the condition is:\n\nif beats[a] == b → a wins.\n\nElse, b wins.\n\nWait, yes.\n\nSo in code:\n\nif a == b: pass\n\nelse:\n\nif beats[a] == b:\n\n   # a wins, b loses → b gets a spot.\n\n   poly +=1\n\nelse:\n\n   # b wins, a loses → a gets a spot.\n\n   nike +=1\n\nSo that's the logic.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nWe can precompute the beats dictionary once.\n\nRead n, A, B.\n\nCompute len_A = len(A), len_B = len(B).\n\nThen for each i in 0 to n-1:\n\na = A[i % len_A]\n\nb = B[i % len_B]\n\ncheck if a == b: skip.\n\nElse, check if a beats b.\n\nSo, in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nbeats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nlen_A = len(A)\nlen_B = len(B)\n\nnike = 0\npoly = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a = A[i % len_A]\n    b = B[i % len_B]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    if beats[a] == b:\n        poly +=1\n    else:\n        nike +=1\n\nprint(nike, poly)\n\nWait, but wait: in the sample input, the output was 3 2.\n\nLet's test this code against the sample.\n\nSample input:\n\nn=7\n\nA is 'RPS' → length 3\n\nB is 'RSPP' → length 4.\n\nSo for each round from 0 to 6:\n\ni=0: a=A[0] = 'R', B[0] = 'R' → same → no.\n\ni=1: a=A[1]='P', B[1]='S'\n\nBeats['P'] is 'R'. So 'R' != 'S' → So does a beat b?\n\nNo, because beats[a] is 'R', which is not equal to b ('S').\n\nSo else clause: b beats a. So a gets a spot. So nike +=1.\n\ni=2: a=A[2] = 'S', B[2] = 'P'\n\nBeats['S'] is 'P'. So b is 'P' → yes. So a beats b → b (Poly) gets spot. poly +=1.\n\ni=3: a=A[0] again (i=3 mod 3=0): 'R', B[3] = 'P'.\n\nBeats['R'] is 'S' != 'P' → else clause: b wins. So a (Nike) gets a spot. So nike +=1.\n\ni=4: a=A[1] 'P', B[4%4=0] = 'R'.\n\nBeats['P'] is 'R' → equals b. So a wins, b gets spot → poly +=1.\n\ni=5: a=A[2] 'S', B[5%4=1] = 'S' → same → no.\n\ni=6: a=A[0] 'R', B[6%4=2] = 'P'.\n\nAgain, beats['R'] is 'S' != 'P' → else. b wins → a gets spot. So nike +=1.\n\nSo let's tally:\n\nAfter i=0: no change.\n\ni=1: nike=1.\n\ni=2: poly=1.\n\ni=3: nike=2.\n\ni=4: poly=2.\n\ni=5: no change.\n\ni=6: nike=3.\n\nSo total: nike=3, poly=2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: what if n is larger than the cycles.\n\nBut the modulo handles that.\n\nWhat if m or k is zero? But according to the input constraints, m and k are at least 1.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they have played a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors. Each round is played according to their respective sequences, which are cycled through repeatedly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Understanding**: The game is played between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who each follow a cyclic sequence of moves. In each round, the winner gives the loser a red spot. The goal is to count the total number of red spots each player ends up with after `n` rounds.\n2. **Cyclic Sequences**: Both players have their own sequences of moves which they cycle through. For each round, the move for each player is determined by their respective sequence at the current index, wrapping around as necessary.\n3. **Winning Conditions**: Using the rules of rock-paper-scissors, we determine the winner of each round. If a player wins, the other player gets a red spot.\n4. **Efficiency Considerations**: Given the constraints, we need an efficient solution. Each round can be processed in constant time, making the overall complexity linear with respect to the number of rounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read the input values\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\n# Define the winning conditions\nbeats = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}\n\n# Initialize counters for red spots\nnike = 0\npoly = 0\n\n# Iterate through each round\nfor i in range(n):\n    a_move = A[i % len(A)]\n    b_move = B[i % len(B)]\n    \n    if a_move == b_move:\n        continue  # Draw, no one gets a spot\n    \n    if beats[a_move] == b_move:\n        poly += 1  # Poly loses, so he gets a spot\n    else:\n        nike += 1  # Nike loses, so he gets a spot\n\n# Output the results\nprint(nike, poly)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by the sequences `A` and `B` for the two players.\n2. **Winning Conditions**: The dictionary `beats` defines what each move can beat. For example, 'R' (Rock) beats 'S' (Scissors).\n3. **Processing Each Round**: For each round, the moves for both players are determined using modulo operations to cycle through their sequences. If the moves are the same, it's a draw. Otherwise, the winner is determined based on the `beats` dictionary, and the corresponding loser's counter is incremented.\n4. **Output**: After processing all rounds, the counts of red spots for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that each round is processed efficiently, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
