He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where given a number of trailing zeros m, I have to find all the positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. Then, output the count of such n's and the numbers themselves in order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because there are always more multiples of 2 than 5, the number of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So, for each multiple of 5, we add one zero, but also for multiples of higher powers like 25, 125, etc.\n\nSo the formula for the number of trailing zeros Z(n) is:\nZ(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nThe task is, given m, to find all n such that Z(n) = m. And then return how many such n's exist and list them in order.\n\nWait, but how do I find these n's? Since Z(n) is a non-decreasing function, once it reaches m, it will stay at m or increase. But sometimes, it can jump over m, meaning no n satisfies Z(n) = m. Like if m is very large, perhaps.\n\nBut for our problem, the input m can be up to 100,000, which isn't too bad.\n\nI think the approach is to find the smallest n where Z(n) >= m, and then check how many consecutive n's (if any) have Z(n) = m.\n\nAlternatively, maybe binary search can help here. Because Z(n) increases as n increases, we can use binary search to find the lower and upper bounds where Z(n) equals m.\n\nWait, but how? Let's think: For a given m, the possible n's form a contiguous range because when you compute Z(n), it's possible that for several consecutive n's, Z(n) remains m before increasing again.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. For a given m, find the minimal n_min such that Z(n_min) = m.\n2. Find the maximal n_max such that Z(n_max) = m.\n3. The count k is n_max - n_min + 1, provided that n_max exists and Z(n_max) = m.\n4. If no such n exists (like when m is larger than all possible Z(n)), then output 0.\n\nSo how do I find n_min and n_max?\n\nI think using binary search would be efficient here.\n\nLet me outline the plan:\n\n- Binary search for the smallest n where Z(n) >= m.\n- Once found, check if Z(n) == m. If not, then there's no solution.\n- Otherwise, find the largest n where Z(n) == m.\n- The numbers between n_min and n_max (inclusive) are the required n's.\n\nWait, but wait. When I perform the binary search, perhaps I should adjust the search space correctly.\n\nLet me think about the binary search for n_min:\n\nWe can set low=0 and high= some upper limit. What's a good upper limit? Well, since for n=5*m, Z(n) could be around m plus some. But perhaps setting high as 5*m is sufficient.\n\nWait, for example, when m=1, n=5 gives Z(n)=1. So 5*1=5. That works.\n\nFor m=5, n=25 gives Z(25) = 6 (since 25//5=5, 25//25=1; total 6). Wait, but earlier examples show that n=5,6,7,8,9 have Z(n)=1. So for m=5, the correct n's start at 25? Or wait, what's Z(25)?\n\nWait, let me calculate Z(25):\n\n25 /5 =5, 25/25=1, 25/125=0. So total 6. So for m=5, the correct n's would be somewhere else.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think differently.\n\nLet me see for m=5. Let's compute Z(n) for various n:\n\nn=20: 20/5=4, 20/25=0 → 4 <5.\n\nn=21: same as 20.\n\nn=22: same.\n\nn=23: same.\n\nn=24: same.\n\nn=25: 25/5=5, 25/25=1 → sum 6. So Z(25)=6>5. So for m=5, the n's must be between 20 and 24, inclusive.\n\nWait, but Z(20) is 4, and Z(21)=4, Z(22)=4, Z(23)=",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of \\( n \\) values that satisfy the given condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are always more multiples of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until the division results in zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To find the smallest \\( n \\) (let's call it `n_min`) where \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\), we use binary search. Similarly, we find the largest \\( n \\) (let's call it `n_max`) where \\( Z(n) \\leq m \\). If \\( Z(n_min) \\) equals \\( m \\), then `n_min` is the starting point. We then check if `Z(n_max)` equals \\( m \\) to confirm the range.\n\n3. **Range Calculation**: If both `n_min` and `n_max` exist and satisfy \\( Z(n) = m \\), the count of such \\( n \\) is \\( n_max - n_min + 1 \\). If no such \\( n \\) exists, the result is 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeroes(m):\n    def z(n):\n        count = 0\n        power = 5\n        while power <= n:\n            count += n // power\n            power *= 5\n        return count\n\n    # Find lower bound\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    n_min = 0\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        current = z(mid)\n        if current < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            n_min = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    # Check if n_min is valid\n    if z(n_min) != m:\n        return 0, []\n\n    # Find upper bound\n    low = n_min\n    high = 5 * m  # Upper limit is arbitrary; set to a large enough value\n    n_max = n_min\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        current = z(mid)\n        if current > m:\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            n_max = mid\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    # Now collect all numbers from n_min to n_max inclusive\n    result = list(range(n_min, n_max + 1))\n    return len(result), result\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\nm = int(input_line)\n\nk, ns = count_trailing_zeroes(m)\n\nprint(k)\nif k > 0:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, ns)))\nelse:\n    print()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function `count_trailing_zeroes`**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros for a given \\( n \\) and uses binary search to find the smallest and largest \\( n \\) values that yield exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros.\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input and converted to an integer \\( m \\).\n- **Output**: The count of valid \\( n \\) values and the values themselves are printed. If no valid \\( n \\) exists, the output indicates this by printing 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, ensuring the solution is optimal even for large values of \\( m \\).",
