A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain resources: drink, lime slices, and salt. I need to calculate the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given the available resources.\n\nLet's break down the input variables:\n\n- n: number of friends\n- k: number of bottles of drink\n- l: milliliters per bottle\n- c: number of limes cut into slices\n- d: slices per lime, so total slices are c * d\n- p: grams of salt\n- nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast per friend\n- np: grams of salt needed per toast per friend\n\nEach toast for all friends requires each person to have their own set. So, for one toast, each friend needs nl ml, one slice, and np grams.\n\nSo, let's think about the total resources required for a certain number of toasts, say t toasts.\n\nTotal drink needed: n * t * nl (since each of the n friends takes nl ml per toast)\nTotal slices needed: n * t (each toast per friend needs one slice)\nSalt needed: n * t * np (each friend uses np grams per toast)\n\nNow, the available resources are:\n\n- Total drink: k * l (all the bottles' content)\n- Slices: c * d (total slices from limes)\n- Salt: p grams\n\nSo, the constraints for t are:\n\n1. n * t * nl ≤ k * l\n2. n * t ≤ c * d\n3. n * t * np ≤ p\n\nWe need to find the maximum t that satisfies all three inequalities.\n\nOur goal is to compute t such that all three conditions are met, and t is as large as possible.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate the maximum possible t based on each resource and then take the minimum of those.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nFor each resource, compute the maximum possible t that resource allows, then the overall t is the minimum of those.\n\nSo for drink:\n\nmax_toasts_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nBut wait, if (k*l) is not enough for n*nl*t, then we have to see what's the max t possible. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for limes:\n\nmax_toasts_lime = (c * d) // n\n\nBecause each toast requires n slices (one per friend). So the total slices must be >= n*t.\n\nAnd for salt:\n\nmax_toasts_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nSo, the maximum t is the minimum of these three values.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nCompute each of these three values and take the smallest one.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead the input as integers.\n\nCompute:\n\nmax_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nmax_lime = (c * d) // n\nmax_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nt = min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt)\n\nThen, print t as a string.\n\nWait, but what about cases where any of these could be zero? Like, if there's not enough for even one toast.\n\nYes, because if any of the computed max_* is less than 1, then t will be zero.\n\nWait, but division in Python using // truncates towards negative infinity. But since all inputs are positive, it's okay.\n\nWait, but let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5: drink total is 20ml.\n\nEach toast needs 3 * t * 3ml. Wait, no: each friend needs 3ml per toast, so per toast, total drink used is 3 * 3 =9ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222... So max_drink is 2.\n\nLime: c*d=10*8=80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices (3 friends). 80/3 is 26.666... so max_lime is 26.\n\nSalt: p is 100g. Each toast requires 3 * 1 =3g. 100/3 is 33.333, so max_salt is 33.\n\nSo t is min(2,26,33)=2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nInput: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10: drink total 1000ml.\n\nEach toast requires 5 *4=20ml. 1000/20=50. So max_drink=50.\n\nLime: c*d=1*19=19. Each toast needs 5 slices. 19//5=3. So max_lime=3.\n\nSalt: p=90g, each toast needs 5*3=15g. 90//15=6.\n\nSo t is min(50,3,6)=3.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nThird sample:\n\nInput: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000: drink is 1e6ml.\n\nEach toast needs 10 *50=500ml. 1e6 /500=2000.\n\nLime: c*d=25*23=575. Each toast needs 10 slices. 575//10=57.\n\nSalt: p=1 gram. Each toast needs 10 *1=10g. 1//10=0.\n\nSo t is min(2000,57,0)=0.\n\nWhich is the third sample output.\n\nSo, the logic seems solid.\n\nNow, how to code this.\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute the three max values.\n\nmax_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nmax_lime = (c * d) // n\nmax_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nt = min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt)\n\nPrint t as a string.\n\nWait, but what if any of the denominators are zero? But according to the problem statement, all inputs are positive. So no division by zero.\n\nSo code is straightforward.\n\nTesting another edge case.\n\nSuppose n=1, k=1, l=1, c=1, d=1, p=1, nl=1, np=1.\n\nmax_drink = (1*1)/(1*1)=1.\n\nmax_lime=1//1=1.\n\nmax_salt=1/(1*1)=1.\n\nt=1.\n\nAnother case where one of the resources is just enough.\n\nLike, n=2, k=1, l=5, so drink is 5ml. nl=2 per friend. So each toast needs 4ml. So 5//4=1.\n\nmax_drink is 1.\n\nLime: c=1, d=10, so slices=10. Each toast needs 2 slices. So 10//2=5.\n\nSalt: p=2, np=1. So 2//2=1.\n\nt=1.\n\nAll makes sense.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: Each toast requires:\n   - `nl` milliliters of drink per friend.\n   - 1 lime slice per friend.\n   - `np` grams of salt per friend.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**:\n   - Total drink available: `k * l`.\n   - Total lime slices available: `c * d`.\n   - Total salt available: `p`.\n\n3. **Determine Maximum Toasts per Resource**:\n   - From the drink: `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n   - From lime slices: `(c * d) // n`.\n   - From salt: `p // (n * np)`.\n\n4. **Find the Minimum**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the smallest value derived from the above calculations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nmax_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nmax_lime = (c * d) // n\nmax_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nt = min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt)\n\nprint(t)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input values are read and parsed into respective variables.\n- **Calculating Maximum Toasts**: For each resource, compute the maximum number of toasts possible using integer division.\n- **Determine the Result**: The minimum value among the computed maximums for each resource gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the limiting factor for the number of toasts, considering all resources simultaneously.",
