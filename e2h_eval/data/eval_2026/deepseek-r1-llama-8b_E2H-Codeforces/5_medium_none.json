Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Hmm, let's see. The problem says that two boots are compatible if their colors are the same or one is a question mark. Oh right, because the question mark is compatible with any color.\n\nSo, the input gives me two strings l and r, each of length n. Each character in these strings represents the color of a left or right boot. My task is to pair as many left and right boots as possible where their colors are compatible.\n\nWait, but each boot can be part of only one pair. So I need to make sure that once a left or right boot is used in a pair, it's not used again.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Let me think about the possible scenarios.\n\nFirst, for each left boot i, I can find all right boots j where l[i] and r[j] are compatible. Then, I need to choose pairs such that no two pairs share a left or right boot.\n\nThis sounds like a bipartite graph matching problem. Each left boot is a node on one side, each right boot on the other. Edges exist between i and j if they are compatible. Then, the maximum matching would give the maximum number of pairs.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 150,000. So building a bipartite graph with 3e5 nodes and potentially 2.25e10 edges is impossible. That's way too big. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nHmm, maybe I can group the left and right boots by their color (including '?') and then compute how many pairs can be formed between these groups.\n\nLet's see: For each color c, count the number of left boots with color c, say L[c], and the number of right boots with color c, R[c]. The number of pairs that can be made from these exact colors is the minimum of L[c] and R[c]. But also, any left boot that's '?' can pair with any right boot.\n\nWait, but the '?' is a special case. Because a left '?' can pair with any right, including those that are '?'. Similarly, a right '?' can pair with any left.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to calculate:\n\n1. For each specific color c (a-z), compute the min(L[c], R[c]). Sum all these.\n2. Add the number of '?' in left multiplied by the number of non-? in right plus the number of '?' in right multiplied by the number of non-? in left.\n   Wait, no. Because '?' can pair with any other, including other '?', but we have to account for overlapping counts.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it as:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is equal to the sum over all colors c of min(L[c], R[c]) plus the number of left '?' multiplied by the number of right '?' minus the sum of min for c when c is '?'. Or maybe not.\n\nWait, no. Let me think differently. The total possible pairs without considering overlaps is:\n\nTotal_pairs = sum_{c} min(L[c], R[c}) + (number of left '?') * (number of right '?')\n\nBut wait, no. Because some pairs could have been counted twice. For example, if a left '?' and a right '?' are both considered in the first term, but they might not be matched because of the way the min is calculated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute:\n\n- For each specific color c (not '?'), add min(L[c], R[c]) to the total.\n- Then, for the '?', the left count is L_? and the right is R_?. The number of pairs from these is min(L_?, R_?), but wait, no—because each left '?' can pair with any right, including those that are '?'. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to separate into four categories:\n\n1. Left is specific (not '?'), right is specific (same as left).\n2. Left is specific, right is specific (but different colors; not compatible).\n3. Left is specific, right is '?': compatible.\n4. Left is '?', right is specific: compatible.\n5. Left is '?', right is '?': compatible.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color. So any left '?' can pair with any right, including another '?'. So for the '?', the number of possible pairs is the minimum of the number of left '?' and the number of right '?'. No, wait, no: because a left '?' can pair with any right, including non-'?' ones. So the total possible pairs involving left '?' is L_? * R_any. But since each pair uses one left and one right, the maximum possible is min(L_?, R_total).\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think: Suppose there are L_? left boots and R_total right boots. How many can they pair? Each left '?' can pair with any right, but each right can only be paired once.\n\nSimilarly, for the right '?', each can pair with any left.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe the optimal way is to pair as many as possible within the specific colors, then use the remaining left and right for cross-pairs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum for each color c of min(L[c], R[c]), plus the number of left '?' multiplied by the number of right '?', minus the min(L['?'], R['?']), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's consider the following:\n\nEach left and right can be either specific or '?'. So, for all specific colors, we take the min(L[c], R[c]) and add them to the total. Then, the remaining left and right are '?', so the number of pairs is the min of the remaining left and right.\n\nWait, but perhaps that's not the case. Because after pairing specific colors, the remaining left and right may include '?', which can be paired together.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. For each specific color c (not '?'), compute the number of pairs as min(L[c], R[c]).\n2. Subtract these from L and R, so we're left with the counts for '?'. So, for the remaining left, it's L_? = L_initial - sum of min for specific c. Similarly for R_?.\n3. The number of pairs from the remaining is min(L_?, R_?). Because each left '?' can pair with each right '?', but we can't have more than the min of the two.\n\nBut wait, perhaps this is not sufficient because some specific colors may have more lefts than rights, leaving some lefts unpaired, which could pair with rights that are '?'. So perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, maybe the maximum number of pairs is the sum over all c (including '?') of min(L[c], R[c]).\n\nWait, but then if a left is '?', it can pair with any right, including those that are not '?'. So for example, suppose L has 100 '?', and R has 50 'a's. Then, the min(L['?'], R['?']) is 0, but the 100 '?' can pair with the 50 'a's, giving 50 pairs. So the sum approach would miss this.\n\nAh, right! So the sum approach only considers the specific colors and the specific pairs, but doesn't account for the possibility of pairing the left '?' with other specific colors.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach must be to find all possible compatible pairs, including those where left is '?', right is specific, or vice versa.\n\nBut how do I efficiently compute this without having to check each pair?\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal way is to:\n\n- Compute the maximum possible pairs by considering all possible options, including the cross-pairs between '?' and specific colors.\n\nBut given the constraints of n being up to 150,000, we need an O(n) solution.\n\nAlternative idea: We can process each right boot and try to match it with the best possible left boot.\n\nBut even that might be too slow.\n\nWait, let me think in terms of frequency counts.\n\nWe can count the frequency of each color in l and r.\n\nThen, for each color c in l, if c is '?', it can pair with any color in r. Similarly, any color in r that is '?', can pair with any color in l.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum number of pairs.\n\nPerhaps, the approach is as follows:\n\nCompute the number of pairs between each specific color c as min(L[c], R[c]). Then, subtract these from L and R, leaving the counts for '?'. Then, the remaining L_? and R_? can form min(L_?, R_?) pairs. Additionally, the left '?' can pair with the remaining R's (which may have specific colors), but wait, no—those specific colors were already accounted for in the min(L[c], R[c]) step.\n\nWait, no. Because in the initial step, for each specific color c, we take min(L[c], R[c]) as pairs. So after that, the remaining R[c] for each c is R[c] - min(L[c], R[c]).\n\nBut then, the remaining R[c] could be zero or positive. So any left '?' can pair with any remaining R[c], but only once per pair.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think of all possible pairs, including those involving '?'.\n\nLet me model this as:\n\n- For each left boot, its color can be c or '?'.\n\n- For each right boot, its color can be d or '?'.\n\n- A pair is compatible if c == d or c is '?' or d is '?'.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the maximum matching where each left is connected to all rights that are compatible.\n\nBut with n=1.5e5, we can't process each pair.\n\nAn alternative approach is to precompute the frequency of each color in l and r.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- l_counts: a dictionary where l_counts[c] is the number of times color c appears in l.\n- r_counts: same for r.\n\nAlso, compute the number of '?' in l and r: l_q and r_q.\n\nNow, the maximum possible pairs can be broken down into several components:\n\n1. Pairs where both are specific colors and same (c): sum over c of min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c]).\n\n2. Pairs where left is '?', right is any (specific or '?').\n\n3. Pairs where right is '?', left is any (specific or '?'). But wait, this includes the cases where both are '?', which are already covered in case 2.\n\nWait, no. Because if I pair a left '?' with a right '?', that's allowed, but it's a single pair. So, in case 2, when I pair left '?' with any right (including '?'), I can get as many as min(l_q, r_q + r_q'), but I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is:\n\nsum_over_c (min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c])) + (l_q * r_q') + (r_q * l_q') - min(l_q, r_q).\n\nWait, no. Maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nmax_pairs = sum(min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c])) for all c in specific colors) + (l_q * r_q) + (l_q * (sum of r_counts[d] for d in specific colors)) + (r_q * (sum of l_counts[d] for d in specific colors)) - (sum(min(l_counts[d], r_counts[d])) for d in specific colors)).\n\nNo, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nAfter pairing all the same specific colors, the remaining left and right boots can be paired as follows:\n\nEach left '?' can pair with any remaining right boot (could be specific or '?'), but each pair can only be used once.\n\nSimilarly, each right '?' can pair with any remaining left boot.\n\nBut since the problem allows any order, perhaps the maximum is:\n\nmax_pairs = sum(min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c])) for all c) + min(l_q, sum(r_counts[d] for d in all colors including ? )) + min(r_q, sum(l_counts[d] for d in all colors including ? )) - sum(min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c])) for c.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum of r_counts[d] for d in all colors including ? is just n, since each right boot is accounted for.\n\nBut after pairing all specific colors, the remaining left and right can be:\n\nleft_remaining = l_counts.get('?', 0) + sum( max(0, l_counts[c] - r_counts[c]) for c in specific )\n\nright_remaining = r_counts.get('?', 0) + sum( max(0, r_counts[c] - l_counts[c]) for c in specific )\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, after pairing the same specific colors, the left and right counts are adjusted.\n\nFor example, for color c:\n\nIf l_counts[c] > r_counts[c], then all r_counts[c] are paired, and l_counts[c] has l_counts[c] - r_counts[c] left.\n\nThese remaining left boots can be either '?', or some specific color.\n\nSimilarly for right boots.\n\nSo, after processing all specific colors, the remaining left and right are:\n\nleft_remaining = sum over c (l_counts[c] - r_counts[c] if l_counts[c] > r_counts[c] else 0) + l_q\n\nright_remaining = sum over c (r_counts[c] - l_counts[c] if r_counts[c] > l_counts[c] else 0) + r_q\n\nWait, no. Because for each specific color c, if l_counts[c] > r_counts[c], then (l_counts[c] - r_counts[c]) left boots remain in l, else nothing. So the total left_remaining is sum over c (max(0, l_counts[c] - r_counts[c])) ) + l_q.\n\nSimilarly for right_remaining: sum over c (max(0, r_counts[c] - l_counts[c])) + r_q.\n\nNow, the remaining left and right can be paired as follows:\n\n- Any left '?' can pair with any right (whether it's a specific color or a '?').\n- Any right '?' can pair with any left.\n\nBut wait, the remaining left could have specific colors or '?'; same for right.\n\nSo, the maximum number of additional pairs is the minimum of left_remaining and right_remaining.\n\nBecause each pair can consist of any left and any right, as long as they are compatible.\n\nWait, but are they compatible? Because the remaining left could be specific, but the right could be specific as well but different. Or a left is specific, right is '?'.\n\nWait, no. Because after processing all specific colors, the remaining left and right are:\n\nLeft_remaining = (for each c, if l_counts[c] > r_counts[c], then l_counts[c] - r_counts[c] else 0) plus l_q.\n\nSimilarly for right_remaining.\n\nWait, no. Because for each specific color c, after pairing min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c]), any remaining l_counts[c] would be l_counts[c] - r_counts[c] only if l_counts[c] was larger. Otherwise, it's zero.\n\nSo, for example, if l_counts['a'] is 5 and r_counts['a'] is 3, then after pairing 3 pairs, l has 2 'a's left. These are specific colors, not '?'.\n\nSimilarly, if l_counts['b'] is 2 and r_counts['b'] is 5, then r has 3 'b's left.\n\nSo the remaining left and right are:\n\nleft_remaining = sum (max(0, l_counts[c] - r_counts[c])) for all c != '?' + l_q\n\nright_remaining = sum (max(0, r_counts[c] - l_counts[c])) for all c != '?' + r_q\n\nNow, the question is: can these remaining left and right be paired in any way, as long as they are compatible.\n\nWait, the definition of compatible is that the left and right colors are the same OR the left is '?', OR the right is '?'.\n\nSo, any pair from the remaining left and right is compatible except when both are specific colors and different.\n\nBut in this scenario, after pairing all same specific colors, the remaining left and right could have:\n\n- Some specific colors (like 'a', 'b') that are not '?'\n- Some '?'\n\nWait, but the left_remaining includes all the remaining specific colors plus the '?', right?\n\nNo, wait. Because in left_remaining, it's the sum of (l_counts[c] - r_counts[c]) for c != '?' plus l_q.\n\nWait, no. Because for c != '?', if l_counts[c] > r_counts[c], then l_counts[c] - r_counts[c] is the remaining, which are specific 'c's. So left_remaining is the sum of (l_counts[c] - r_counts[c]) for c in specific colors, plus the number of left '?'.\n\nSimilarly for right_remaining.\n\nSo, in the remaining left and right, the specific colors can be different from each other or same, but in the case where they are same, they would have been paired in the first step.\n\nSo, in the remaining left and right, the specific colors are not necessarily the same.\n\nThus, the remaining left and right can be paired as:\n\nleft_remaining is the total number of left boots remaining (could be specific or ?)\nright_remaining is the total number of right boots remaining (could be specific or ?)\n\nEach pair must consist of a left and a right, and they must be compatible.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum possible pairs in this scenario.\n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum possible is the minimum of left_remaining and right_remaining, because each can pair with any other.\n\nWait, no. Because if the left_remaining is 5 and right_remaining is 10, the maximum pairs is 5. But not all pairs are compatible.\n\nWait, no. Because all pairs are compatible except when both are specific colors and different.\n\nBut in the remaining left and right, the specific colors may vary. So some pairs may not be compatible.\n\nWait, for example, suppose left_remaining has 2 'a's and 3 'b's, and right_remaining has 1 'a' and 4 'b's.\n\nIn this case:\n\nThe 'a's can pair with the 'a' on the right (1 pair). The 'b's can pair with the 'b's on the right (4 pairs). So total is 5.\n\nBut what if the left_remaining is 2 'a's and the right_remaining is 3 'b's. Then, no pairs are possible because 'a' and 'b' are different and neither is '?'.\n\nSo, the maximum number of pairs in this case is zero.\n\nHmm, so the initial approach of adding the min(left_remaining, right_remaining) is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that some specific colors may not be compatible.\n\nThis complicates things significantly.\n\nSo, what's the correct approach here?\n\nIdea: After pairing the same specific colors, the remaining left and right can be grouped into two types: specific colors and '?'.\n\nThe specific color remains can be thought of as a multiset, and the '?' remains can be thought of as a separate count.\n\nThen, the strategy is to pair as much as possible, starting with the '?', then with the specific colors.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet me think in terms of variables:\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- s_left: the set of specific colors in left_remaining.\n- s_right: the set of specific colors in right_remaining.\n- q_left: the number of left '?'.\n- q_right: the number of right '?'.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Pair as many as possible between left '?' and right '?'.\n\n   The number of such pairs is min(q_left, q_right).\n\n   After this, subtract this from q_left and q_right.\n\n   Update the remaining q_left and q_right.\n\n2. Now, pair left '?' with any remaining specific right colors.\n\n   The number is q_left multiplied by the sum of right_remaining specific colors.\n\n   But each right can be used at most once.\n\n   So, the maximum possible is min(q_left, sum_of_right_specific).\n\n   Wait, but each right specific can be paired with any left '?'. So the maximum is min(q_left, sum_of_right_specific).\n\n   Similarly, pair right '?' with left specific.\n\n   The maximum is min(q_right, sum_of_left_specific).\n\n3. Now, pair the specific colors between left and right.\n\n   For each specific color c in s_left, find how many are present in s_right.\n\n   The number of pairs is the minimum of the counts in s_left and s_right for each c.\n\n   Sum this for all c.\n\nBut wait, this seems manageable.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the specific pairs: sum min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c]) for all c.\n\n2. Compute the remaining left and right:\n\n   left_remaining = sum (l_counts[c] - r_counts[c] for c in specific) + l_q.\n\n   right_remaining = sum (r_counts[c] - l_counts[c] for c in specific) + r_q.\n\n3. Extract s_left (the specific colors remaining in left_remaining) and s_right (specific colors in right_remaining).\n\n   Also, extract q_left and q_right.\n\n4. Now, pair as much as possible:\n\n   a. Pair q_left and q_right: min(q_left, q_right) pairs.\n\n   b. Subtract this from q_left and q_right.\n\n   c. Now, pair q_left with s_right: the maximum is min(q_left, sum(s_right.values())).\n\n      Subtract this from q_left and sum(s_right) accordingly.\n\n   d. Similarly, pair q_right with s_left: min(q_right, sum(s_left.values())).\n\n      Subtract this.\n\n   e. Now, pair s_left and s_right: for each c in s_left, if c exists in s_right, add min(s_left[c], s_right[c]) to the total.\n\n5. The sum of all these is the maximum pairs.\n\nBut wait, how do I represent s_left and s_right? It's the counts of specific colors remaining after step 1.\n\nSo, for s_left, it's a dictionary where s_left[c] is the number of left boots of color c that are remaining after step 1.\n\nSimilarly for s_right.\n\nBut how to compute s_left and s_right.\n\nWait, after step 1, for each specific color c:\n\nIf l_counts[c] > r_counts[c], then (l_counts[c] - r_counts[c]) left boots are added to s_left.\n\nSimilarly, if r_counts[c] > l_counts[c], then (r_counts[c] - l_counts[c]) right boots are added to s_right.\n\nSo, for each c in l_counts and r_counts (excluding '?'), we compute these.\n\nOnce I have s_left, s_right, q_left, q_right, I proceed as described.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read n, l, r.\n\n2. Compute l_counts and r_counts as dictionaries, including '?'.\n\n   For l, count each character, same for r.\n\n3. Compute the specific pairs:\n\n   specific_pairs = 0\n\n   for each c in l_counts:\n\n       if c == '?': continue\n\n       specific_pairs += min(l_counts[c], r_counts.get(c, 0))\n\n4.

Now, the remaining left is s_left (sum of s_left.values()) plus q_left.\n\n   Similarly, the remaining right is s_right (sum of s_right.values()) plus q_right.\n\n6. Now, process the remaining:\n\n   a. Pair q_left and q_right: pairs = min(q_left, q_right).\n\n      Add pairs to total.\n\n      Subtract pairs from q_left and q_right.\n\n   b. Now, pair q_left with s_right:\n\n      available_in_right = sum(s_right.values())\n\n      take = min(q_left, available_in_right)\n\n      add take to total.\n\n      subtract take from q_left and from each s_right entries.\n\n      (But how? Since each s_right is a count for each color.)\n\n      Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as taking as many as possible, regardless of the color.\n\n      So, take = min(q_left, sum(s_right.values()))\n\n      So, for each color in s_right, the maximum possible is to pair all of them with q_left, but only up to the take.\n\n      So, for each color c in s_right:\n\n          possible = min(s_right[c], take)\n\n          add possible to the total.\n\n          subtract possible from s_right[c].\n\n          subtract possible from take.\n\n          if take == 0: break.\n\n      Similarly for step d.\n\n   Wait, but this might complicate the code.\n\n   Alternatively, since the order doesn't matter, perhaps the maximum is to take as much as possible.\n\n   So, for step b, the maximum possible is min(q_left, sum(s_right.values())).\n\n   Similarly, for step d, the maximum is min(q_right, sum(s_left.values())).\n\n   So, after each step, the counts are adjusted.\n\n7. Now, pair the remaining specific colors in s_left and s_right.\n\n   For each color c in s_left:\n\n       if c is in s_right:\n\n           take = min(s_left[c], s_right[c])\n\n           add take to total.\n\n           subtract take from s_left[c] and s_right[c].\n\n   So, this is similar to the initial specific pairs, but now only for the remaining specific colors.\n\n8. Sum all these steps to get the total pairs.\n\nBut how to model the adjustments in steps b and d.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps can be implemented as:\n\ntotal = specific_pairs\n\n# Step a: pair q_left and q_right\n\ntake = min(q_left, q_right)\n\ntotal += take\n\nq_left -= take\n\nq_right -= take\n\n# Step b: pair q_left with s_right\n\ntake = min(q_left, sum(s_right.values()))\n\nif take > 0:\n\n    total += take\n\n    # subtract take from s_right\n\n    for c in list(s_right.keys()):\n\n        if s_right[c] > 0:\n\n            possible = min(s_right[c], take)\n\n            s_right[c] -= possible\n\n            take -= possible\n\n            if take == 0:\n\n                break\n\n    # Also, subtract take from q_left\n\n    q_left -= take\n\n# Step c: pair q_right with s_left\n\ntake = min(q_right, sum(s_left.values()))\n\nif take > 0:\n\n    total += take\n\n    for c in list(s_left.keys()):\n\n        if s_left[c] > 0:\n\n            possible = min(s_left[c], take)\n\n            s_left[c] -= possible\n\n            take -= possible\n\n            if take == 0:\n\n                break\n\n    q_right -= take\n\n# Step d: pair s_left and s_right\n\nfor c in s_left:\n\n    if c in s_right:\n\n        take = min(s_left[c], s_right[c])\n\n        if take > 0:\n\n            total += take\n\n            s_left[c] -= take\n\n            s_right[c] -= take\n\nSo, the code would implement this logic.\n\nBut wait, this approach may not capture all possibilities, especially when the order of pairing affects the total.\n\nBut given time constraints, perhaps this is manageable.\n\nNow, the next issue is how to represent the pairs.\n\nOnce the maximum pairs are determined, we need to output the pairs themselves.\n\nBut for large n, storing all pairs is impossible. So, perhaps the problem expects us to compute the maximum number of pairs and print that, along with the pairs in any order.\n\nWait, looking back at the sample input:\n\nIn the sample, the output is printed as a list of pairs, but for n=10, the output is 5 pairs, which is less than n.\n\nSo, the problem requires to output all the selected pairs, but for large n, this is impractical.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that the code should print k followed by k lines, each with a_j and b_j.\n\nBut for n=150,000, k can be up to 150,000, which makes it impossible to store all the pairs in memory.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem expects us to compute the maximum number of pairs and not output the specific pairs.\n\nBut no, the sample shows that the output includes the pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps the intended approach is to compute the maximum number of pairs, but not necessarily track which specific pairs are chosen.\n\nBut the problem statement says, \"Print the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots ... the following k lines should contain pairs a_j, b_j ...\"\n\nSo, the code must output all the selected pairs.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, this would require a lot of memory.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects us to output the maximum number of pairs, and not the actual pairs, but the sample shows that it does require the pairs.\n\nSo, perhaps the intended solution is to model the problem as a bipartite graph and find a maximum matching using a greedy algorithm, but for n=1.5e5, that's not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: since the problem allows any order of pairs, perhaps the maximum matching is achieved by greedily pairing each left with the earliest possible right.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs can be computed by the approach I outlined earlier, but the actual pairing needs to be tracked.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute all the pairs for specific colors.\n\n   For each color c, the number of pairs is min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c]).\n\n   For each pair, assign the left and right indices.\n\n   But which left and right to choose?\n\n   It's arbitrary, but perhaps for each c, we can pair the first m lefts with the first m rights, where m is the min.\n\n2. Then, process the remaining left and right, including the '?', as described.\n\nBut for the remaining, perhaps we can pair the left '?' with the right '?' first, then with the specific right, and then pair the specific left with the specific right.\n\nBut the challenge is to track which specific left and right boots are used.\n\nThis seems very involved.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the optimal way is to proceed with the approach of calculating the maximum number of pairs, but not outputting the actual pairs, unless the problem expects it.\n\nBut the sample shows that the output requires the pairs, so the code must output them.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nImplement the steps to compute the maximum number of pairs, and also track which left and right boots are used in each step.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem as a bipartite graph and find the maximum matching.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, this is impossible with standard algorithms.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem can be transformed into a bipartite graph where each left is connected to all compatible rights, and then find a maximum matching.\n\nBut again, it's not feasible for 1.5e5 nodes.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be optimized by grouping the left and right boots into their color groups.\n\nEach group for left and right can be processed as follows:\n\n- For each color c in left and right, pair as many as possible.\n\n- For the remaining left and right, pair as many as possible between the '?', then between specific and '?'.\n\nBut then, how to track which specific left and right are used.\n\nWait, perhaps for the specific pairs, we can pair the left and right in the order they appear.\n\nFor example, for each color c:\n\nTake the first m lefts with color c and the first m rights with color c.\n\nMark them as used.\n\nFor the remaining left and right, process the '?'.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, this is manageable, as we can track the indices.\n\nSo, let me outline this approach:\n\nInitialize arrays to track used left and right boots.\n\nFor each specific color c:\n\n   m = min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c])\n\n   for i in 0 to m-1:\n\n       mark left i as used.\n\n       mark right i as used.\n\nAdd m pairs.\n\nThen, for the '?', process as follows:\n\nCollect all the lefts that are '?': indices where l[i] is '?'.\n\nCollect all the rights that are '?': indices where r[i] is '?'.\n\nThe number of pairs possible is min(len(lefts?), len(rights?)).\n\nMark them as used.\n\nThen, for the remaining lefts? and rights, process the specific ones.\n\nBut wait, after pairing the specific colors, the remaining lefts and rights may include '?', which can be paired with any specific right.\n\nSo, after pairing the specific colors, collect all the unused lefts? and unused rights.\n\nPair as much as possible between lefts? and unused rights.\n\nThen, pair as much as possible between unused lefts and unused rights.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nBut given that the problem requires the actual pairs, this approach is necessary.\n\nSo, let's proceed:\n\nImplement the steps as:\n\n1. For each specific color c, pair as many as possible.\n\n   For each c, iterate through the lefts and rights in order, and mark used.\n\n2. For the '?', pair as much as possible between left and right.\n\n   a. Pair lefts? with rights?.\n\n   b. Pair lefts? with remaining rights.\n\n   c. Pair rights? with remaining lefts.\n\n   d. Pair remaining lefts and rights.\n\nBut again, this is quite involved.\n\nBut given time constraints, perhaps this is the way to proceed.\n\nSo, let's outline the code.\n\nFirst, read n, l, r.\n\nThen, create lists of left and right indices:\n\nleft_indices = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == '?']\n\nright_indices = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == '?']\n\nBut perhaps it's better to process all the specific colors first.\n\nAnother approach:\n\nCreate a list of lefts and rights, and for each, note their color and index.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each color c in specific colors, find the positions in l and r and pair them.\n\nBut this requires knowing the order of the boots.\n\nBut perhaps, for the purpose of outputting the pairs, it's necessary to track which specific left and right are used.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n1. Create a list of used flags for left and right.\n\nused_left = [False] * n\n\nused_right = [False] * n\n\n2. For each specific color c:\n\n   count_l = number of lefts with color c.\n\n   count_r = number of rights with color c.\n\n   m = min(count_l, count_r)\n\n   for i in range(m):\n\n       left_idx = find the i-th occurrence of c in l.\n\n       right_idx = find the i-th occurrence of c in r.\n\n       mark used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n       mark used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n   add m pairs.\n\n3. Now, collect the unused lefts and rights:\n\nunused_left = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i]]\n\nunused_right = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i]]\n\n4. Now, handle the '?' cases:\n\n   a. Collect all unused lefts that are '?': q_left = [i for i in unused_left if l[i] == '?']\n\n   b. Collect all unused rights that are '?': q_right = [i for i in unused_right if r[i] == '?']\n\n   m = min(len(q_left), len(q_right))\n\n   for i in range(m):\n\n       pair (q_left[i], q_right[i])\n\n   update unused_left and unused_right accordingly.\n\n5. Now, handle the pairing of lefts? with remaining rights.\n\n   For the remaining unused_right:\n\n   collect all unused_right that are not '?': rem_right = [i for i in unused_right if r[i] != '?']\n\n   len_rem_right = len(rem_right)\n\n   m = min(len(q_left), len_rem_right)\n\n   for i in range(m):\n\n       pair (q_left[i], rem_right[i])\n\n   update unused_left and unused_right.\n\n6. Similarly, pair unused_right? with rem_left.\n\n   rem_left = [i for i in",
