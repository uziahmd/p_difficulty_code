He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

It then prints these `k` integers in increasing order.\n\nThe `count_zeros` function calculates the number of positive integers `n` for a given `m`. It uses the fact that the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is equal to the number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of `n!`.\n\nThe `find_values` function finds all values of `n` for a given `m`. It iterates over all positive integers `i` until it finds the first value of `i` for which `count_zeros(i)` is greater than `m`.\n\nThe `main` function reads the input, calls the `count_zeros` and `find_values` functions, and prints the results.\n\nYou can run this script by saving it to a file (e.g., `trivial_problem.py`) and running it using Python (e.g., `python trivial_problem.py`). Then, you can provide the input by typing it into the console when prompted.",
