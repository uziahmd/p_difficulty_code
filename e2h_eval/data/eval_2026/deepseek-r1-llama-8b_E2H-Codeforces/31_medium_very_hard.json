Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Vanya is trying to balance the sum of his found cards to zero. The problem gives me the number of found cards (n) and the maximum absolute value x on any card. Also, it's given that all the found cards have numbers within -x to x. My task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find to make the total sum zero.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. To make the total sum zero, we need the sum of the found cards plus the sum of the additional cards to be zero. So, the sum of the additional cards should be equal to -S. Let's denote the sum of the additional cards as T. So, T = -S.\n\nBut each additional card can contribute a value between -x and x. So, each card can add up to x in positive or negative. But since we're trying to reach T, which might be positive or negative, I need to find the minimal number of cards required to reach exactly T using each card's contribution being at most x.\n\nWait, but wait. Because the additional cards can be any number from -x to x, but their sum must be exactly T. So, the minimal number of cards is determined by how much T is in magnitude relative to x.\n\nLet me rephrase: T is the target sum for the additional cards. So, the minimal number of cards needed is the smallest k such that |T| <= k * x. Because each card can contribute at most x towards the sum.\n\nBut wait, no. Because each card can contribute any amount between -x and x, but when considering the sum, the maximum possible per card is x. So, the minimal k is the ceiling of |T| divided by x. Because if |T| is 5 and x is 3, then 5/3 is 1.666..., so you need 2 cards: 3 + 2.\n\nSo, the formula would be k = ceil(|T| / x). But wait, what if T is zero? Then no cards are needed.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the found cards.\n2. Compute T = -S.\n3. If T is zero, output 0.\n4. Else, compute the absolute value of T, divide by x, and take the ceiling. That's the minimal number of cards.\n\nWait, but let me test this with the examples given.\n\nIn the first example:\n\nInput is 3 2 and the cards are [-1, 1, 2]. Sum S is (-1 +1 +2) = 2. So T = -2. So |T| is 2. x is 2. 2 / 2 is 1. So minimal cards is 1, which matches the sample.\n\nSecond example: n=2, x=3. Cards are [-2, -2]. Sum S is -4. T is 4. |T|=4. x=3. 4/3 is ~1.333, so ceiling is 2. So two cards, each with 2, because 2*2=4. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: suppose T is 5, x is 3. Then 5/3 is ~1.666, so 2 cards. One card 3, another 2.\n\nWhat if T is 0? Then no cards needed.\n\nWhat if T is 3, x is 3? Then 1 card.\n\nWhat if T is 4, x is 3? 2 cards: 3+1, but each card can be up to 3. Wait, no. Wait, the additional cards can have any value between -3 and 3. So for T=4, you can have two cards: 3 and 1. Or 2 and 2. Either way, two cards.\n\nYes, so the formula holds.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Calculate S as the sum of the given cards.\n- Compute T = -S.\n- If T is zero, output 0.\n- Else, compute the absolute value of T, divide by x, and take the ceiling of that value.\n\nBut wait, what if T is not exactly divisible by x? Like, say T=7, x=3. 7/3 is ~2.333, so ceiling is 3. 3*3=9 >=7. So 3 cards.\n\nWait, but wait. What if T is negative? Since we're taking the absolute value, it doesn't matter. Because whether T is positive or negative, the minimal number of cards is the same.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of n integers.\n\nCompute S = sum of the list.\n\nCompute T = -S.\n\nIf T ==0: output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nabs_T = abs(T)\n\nk = (abs_T + x -1) // x\n\nBecause adding x-1 ensures that any remainder causes the division to round up.\n\nSo, for example, 5 and x=3: 5+3-1=7, 7//3=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, implement this.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: All found cards sum to zero. So T is zero. Output 0.\n\nEdge case 2: Found cards sum to something that requires a lot of cards.\n\nFor example, n=1000, x=1. Suppose the sum is 999. So T is 999, which is 999*1. So the minimal number is 999 cards, each with 1.\n\nWait, but wait. Because each card can contribute up to 1. So for 999, yes, 999 cards are needed.\n\nAnother edge case: T is zero. For example, sum is zero, so no cards needed.\n\nAnother case: x is zero. But according to the input constraints, x is at least 1. So no, x can't be zero.\n\nSo, now, let's proceed to write the code.\n\nThe code structure will be:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of n integers.\n\nCompute S = sum(list).\n\nCompute T = -S.\n\nIf T ==0: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nabs_T = abs(T)\n\nk = (abs_T + x -1) // x\n\nPrint k.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, in the problem statement, the output is supposed to be in the same format as the examples. Looking back, the sample inputs were given as two lines: first line '3 2' etc. But in the output, the samples show something like ['1', '2'], which seems to indicate that each test case is printed as a single line with the output. Hmm, perhaps the initial description was a bit confusing.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement again:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', '2']\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is written as two separate test cases, but in reality, the program is to read one test case.\n\nWait, no. Because in the problem statement, it says \"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input...\".\n\nSo, the input will consist of a single test case.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, it's written as two test cases, but that's probably a formatting issue. So, the actual input will be one test case, with two lines: the first line has n and x, the second line has n space-separated integers.\n\nSo, the code can read these correctly.\n\nSo, the code should:\n\n- Read the first line as n and x.\n\n- Read the second line as a list of n integers.\n\nCompute S, T, etc., then output the minimal k.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\nt = -s\nif t == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n    k = (abs_t + x -1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but wait: in the sample input, the output is a list like ['1', '2'], but in the problem statement's note, it's said that the output should be a single number. So perhaps that's just an example representation, and the actual output is a single integer per test case.\n\nWait, looking back: the problem says \"Print a single number — the answer to the problem.\"\n\nSo, the code should output the integer k, not a list.\n\nSo, the code as written is correct.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, x=2, cards are -1,1,2.\n\nsum is (-1+1+2)=2.\n\nt = -2.\n\nabs_t=2.\n\nk=(2+2-1)/2 = 3//2=1. So output 1.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, x=3, cards are -2,-2.\n\nsum is -4.\n\nt=4.\n\nabs_t=4.\n\nk=(4+3-1)//3=6//3=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, x=5, card is 3.\n\nsum is 3.\n\nt=-3.\n\nabs_t=3.\n\nk= (3+5-1)/5 = 7//5=1.\n\nSo one card with -3, but wait, the card can have maximum 5. So yes.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, x=5, card is 5.\n\nsum is 5.\n\nt=-5.\n\nabs_t=5.\n\nk=1.\n\nBecause 5 is exactly x.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, x=5, cards are [5,5]. sum is 10. t=-10.\n\nabs_t=10.\n\nk= (10+5-1)/5=14/5=2.8 → floor is 2. But wait, 10 is 5*2, so 2 cards.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when T is 11, x=5. 11/5=2.2 → ceiling is 3. So 3 cards.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nI think this should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his found cards equals zero. Each card can have a value between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Sum of Found Cards**: Compute the sum \\( S \\) of the values on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Target Sum for Additional Cards**: The target sum \\( T \\) for the additional cards is \\( -S \\). This is because the total sum of all cards (found and additional) should be zero.\n3. **Check for Zero Target Sum**: If \\( T \\) is zero, no additional cards are needed, so the result is 0.\n4. **Compute Minimum Number of Cards**: If \\( T \\) is not zero, compute the absolute value of \\( T \\) and determine the minimum number of additional cards required. This is done by dividing the absolute value of \\( T \\) by \\( x \\) and taking the ceiling of the result. This ensures that each card contributes the maximum possible value towards reaching the target sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\nt = -s\n\nif t == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n    k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of found cards \\( n \\) and the maximum absolute value \\( x \\). The second line reads the values on these \\( n \\) cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum \\( S \\) of the found cards is calculated.\n3. **Target Sum Calculation**: The target sum \\( T \\) for the additional cards is determined as \\( -S \\).\n4. **Zero Check**: If \\( T \\) is zero, output 0 as no additional cards are needed.\n5. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: For non-zero \\( T \\), compute the absolute value of \\( T \\) and use integer division to determine the minimum number of cards required. The formula `(abs_t + x - 1) // x` ensures that we round up when there's any remainder, giving the correct minimum number of cards needed.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of additional cards required to balance the sum to zero using basic arithmetic operations and checks.",
