    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Valera's array and a function f(x). The function f(x) is the sum of certain elements from the array based on the binary representation of x. My task is to find the maximum value of f(x) where x is between 0 and m inclusive.\n\nHmm, let me break it down. So, the array has n elements a_0 to a_{n-1}. The function f(x) is calculated by looking at each bit in x's binary representation. For each bit i that is set (i.e., equals 1), we add a_i to the sum. So for example, if x is 5, which is 101 in binary, then bits 0 and 2 are set. So f(5) = a_0 + a_2.\n\nThe goal is to find the maximum possible f(x) for all x in [0, m]. \n\nThe input gives me n, the array a, and the binary string representing m. So first, I need to parse m correctly into an integer. But wait, the binary string is s0s1...sn-1. Oh right, because the problem statement says that m is equal to the binary number formed by those digits. So for instance, if s is '11010', then m is 26 in decimal because 1*(16) + 1*(8) + 0*(4) + 1*(2) + 0*(1) = 26.\n\nBut wait, no: actually, the length of the binary string is n digits, right? Because n is the number of elements in the array. So for example, in the sample input, n=5, and the binary string is '11010' which is 5 digits long. So m is 16 + 8 + 2 = 26? Wait, let me see: the sample input's third line is '11010', which is 5 digits, so m is 1*(2^4) + 1*(2^3) + 0*(2^2) + 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^0) = 16+8+2=26. Yes.\n\nWait no, wait. Wait, in the sample input, the third line is '11010', and m is 20+21+23=11? No, wait that's the note. Oh wait, in the note, the second test case, m is 11. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, the note says: in the second sample, m is 20+21+23=11? Or wait, no, the note says:\n\n\"In the second sample m = 20 + 21 + 23 = 11, the maximum value of function equals f(5) = a0 + a2 = 17 + 10 = 27.\"\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Because m is 11, but the binary string is '11010' which is 26 in decimal. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn-1 — the binary representation of number m. So m is the integer whose binary is s.\n\nWait, but what's the length of s? It's n digits. So m can be up to 2^n -1.\n\nWait, but in the note, for the second sample, m is 11, which is 1011 in binary, which is 4 bits. But the binary string is '11010' which is 5 digits. That suggests that perhaps my understanding is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the note is incorrect or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the note is referring to a different part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the binary string is given as a string of length n, not necessarily representing the actual m's binary form. Wait, no, the problem says \"the binary representation of number m\".\n\nSo the sample input is:\n\n['2\\n3 8\\n10', '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010']\n\nWait, the third line is '11010' which is 5 characters, but n is 5 in this case. So m is 16+8+2=26? But the note says that m is 11. Hmm, perhaps the note is a typo. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the binary string is the binary representation of x, not m. No, the problem says it's m's binary. So perhaps the note is a mistake, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWell, regardless, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that m is the integer represented by the binary string s of length n.\n\nSo, for the problem, I need to compute f(x) for x in 0..m, and find the maximum.\n\nBut considering n can be up to 105, m can be up to 2^105, which is way too big to iterate through all x directly. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the function f(x). Each bit in x contributes a_i if the bit is set. So f(x) is the sum of a_i for all bits i that are set in x.\n\nWe need to maximize this sum, given that x ≤ m.\n\nSo the maximum f(x) will be the sum of as many a_i's as possible, but subject to x being ≤ m.\n\nWait, but how do the a_i's correspond to the bits? Each a_i is added when the i-th bit is set in x.\n\nSo, the maximum f(x) is achieved when x has as many high a_i's as possible.\n\nBut the constraint is x ≤ m. So perhaps the maximum is the sum of all a_i's where the corresponding bit is set in m, plus some other bits that don't exceed m.\n\nWait, but no. For example, suppose m is such that some higher bits can be turned off, and lower bits can be turned on to get a higher sum.\n\nWait, but the a_i's can be arbitrary. So the optimal x may not be m itself.\n\nSo, for example, suppose m is 5 (101), and a_0 is 10, a_1 is 20, a_2 is 30. Then f(5) is a_0 + a_1 = 30. But if a_2 is 1000, then f(5) is 30, but if I can set x to 7, which is 111, then f(7) is 10+20+30=60, which is larger than 30. But 7 is larger than 5, so x can't be 7. So in that case, the maximum would be 30.\n\nAnother example: suppose m is 3 (11), a_0=1, a_1=2. Then f(3)=3. But if I can find x=2 (10), f(x)=1+0=1. Not better. Or x=1 (01), f(x)=1. So maximum is 3.\n\nBut suppose m is 5 (101), and a_0=1, a_1=1, a_2=3. Then f(5) is 1+1+3=5. What if we can choose x=6 (110), which is 6>5? No, can't do that. So maximum is 5.\n\nWait, but what if m is 5, and a_2=1000, a_1=999, a_0=1. Then f(5)=1+999=1000, which is the same as just a_1. But if x=3 (11), f(x)=1 + 999=1000 as well. So in that case, the maximum is 1000, which is same as f(5) and f(3).\n\nBut perhaps the maximum is achieved at a point where x is less than m but has more high a_i's.\n\nSo the key is to find the x ≤ m that has the maximum possible sum of a_i's where the i-th bit is set.\n\nSo the problem reduces to selecting a subset of bits, such that the sum of a_i's is maximized, and the binary number formed by those bits is ≤ m.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis sounds like a bitmask problem, where each bit can be set or not, but the resulting number must be ≤ m.\n\nBut with n up to 105, trying all possible subsets is impossible because 2^105 is way too big.\n\nSo we need a dynamic programming approach.\n\nI recall that in some problems, like finding the maximum XOR less than or equal to a target, or finding the maximum subset sum under a certain condition, DP is used.\n\nYes, perhaps a DP approach where we process each bit from the highest to the lowest, and track whether the current prefix is already less than m's prefix or equal.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\nWe'll model the state as (position, tight), where 'tight' indicates whether the current bits chosen are exactly equal to m's bits up to that position. If tight is True, then the next bits cannot exceed m's corresponding bits. If tight is False, the next bits can be anything.\n\nAt each step, for each state, we decide whether to set the current bit or not, considering the constraints of 'tight'.\n\nAdditionally, for each state, we'll track the maximum sum achievable.\n\nThe transition would be:\n\nFor each state (pos, tight), and for each possible choice of setting the current bit (0 or 1):\n\n- If tight is True, then the current bit can be at most the corresponding bit in m. So if the current bit in m is b, then the chosen bit can be 0 or 1 only if it's ≤ b.\n\nWait, no. Wait, tight means that up to this bit, the selected bits are exactly matching m's bits. So for the next bits, if the current bit is set to a value less than m's bit, then tight becomes False, and the rest can be anything. If it's equal, tight remains True.\n\nSo, for each state (pos, tight), we consider all possible choices of the current bit (0 or 1), and update the next state accordingly.\n\nMoreover, for each possible state, we track the maximum sum of a_i's accumulated so far.\n\nThus, the DP state can be defined as follows:\n\ndp[pos][tight] = maximum sum achievable up to position pos, given that the bits up to pos are either exactly matching m's (tight=True) or have already been chosen to be less than m's (tight=False).\n\nWait, but the a_i's are indexed by the bit position. So for each bit i, if the bit is set in x, then we add a_i to the sum.\n\nSo, when processing each bit, the choice to set it or not affects the sum.\n\nSo, the transitions would look like this:\n\nFor each position i (from 0 to n-1, perhaps processed in reverse order, since higher bits have more weight):\n\n- Current state: pos i, tight is t.\n\n- For each possible choice of the i-th bit: 0 or 1.\n\n   - If tight is True, the chosen bit can't exceed the i-th bit of m.\n\n   - So, if the i-th bit of m is b:\n\n      - If we choose 0: then the next tight is still True only if all previous bits were exactly m's bits, and this bit is 0. But since we're at position i, after choosing 0, the tight becomes False for the next bits, because 0 < b (assuming b is 1).\n\n      - Wait, no. Let's say the current bit is 0, but m's bit is 1. Then, after this bit, the number is now definitely less than m, so tight becomes False for the next bits.\n\n      - If we choose 1: then, the next tight is True only if the chosen bit is equal to m's bit.\n\n   - So, for each choice (0 or 1), check if it's allowed given the current tight state.\n\n   - For each allowed choice, compute the new tight state.\n\n   - Add a_i to the sum if the chosen bit is 1.\n\nSo, the DP will process each bit from the highest to the lowest, keeping track of the maximum sum possible for each state.\n\nThe base case is dp[n][False] = 0, but wait, perhaps the initial state is before any bits are processed.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial state is at position 0 (the most significant bit?), with tight being True, and sum 0.\n\nWait, but the bits are ordered as per their significance. So perhaps we should process the bits starting from the most significant to the least.\n\nWait, in the binary string, the first character is the most significant bit. For example, '11010' represents 16+8+2=26. So, the first character is the 4th bit (since 2^4 is 16). Wait, but the array a has indices 0 to n-1, which correspond to bits 0 to n-1. Wait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, no: the function f(x) is the sum of a_i for each bit i that is set in x. So, the 0-th bit of x corresponds to a_0, the 1st bit to a_1, etc. So, the bits are indexed starting from 0 as the least significant bit.\n\nWait, but the binary string given is s0s1...sn-1, which is interpreted as a binary number. So, s0 is the most significant bit? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, in the sample input, the binary string is '11010'. Let's see what that is.\n\nIf s0 is the first character, then the binary number is 1*(2^4) + 1*(2^3) + 0*(2^2) + 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^0) = 16+8+2=26.\n\nBut the note says that for the second sample, m=11, which is 1011 in binary. So, how does that fit into the problem?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify.\n\nThe binary string s is s0s1...sn-1. So, the value of m is sum_{i=0 to n-1} s_i * 2^{n-1 -i}.\n\nWait, because for example, for a 5-digit string, the first digit is s0, which is multiplied by 2^4 (since 5-1=4), then s1 is multiplied by 2^3, and so on.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, for s = 'b0b1b2...b(n-1)', m is sum_{i=0 to n-1} b_i * 2^{(n-1)-i}.\n\nSo, for the binary string s, the first character is the most significant bit.\n\nTherefore, when processing the bits, the leftmost character is the highest bit.\n\nSo, in the DP, the bits are processed from the highest (leftmost) to the lowest (rightmost). So, for a binary string of length n, the first bit is the 2^{n-1} place, the next is 2^{n-2}, and so on.\n\nSo, the DP will process each bit from 0 to n-1, with 0 being the most significant bit.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should index the bits from 0 as the most significant to n-1 as the least. So, for a string of length n, the 0-th character is the most significant bit, and the (n-1)-th is the least significant.\n\nSo, during the DP, the bits are processed from 0 to n-1, with 0 being the most significant.\n\nWait, but in terms of the array a, the i-th element corresponds to the i-th bit of x. So, when processing the most significant bit (bit 0), a_0 is added if that bit is set.\n\nWait, but that depends on how the bits are mapped to the array. So, the 0-th bit of x corresponds to a_0, the 1st bit to a_1, etc. So, when processing the most significant bit (which is the 0-th in the string), we check if it's set, and add a_0 if so.\n\nSo, the processing order is from the most significant bit (s[0]) to the least (s[n-1]).\n\nNow, the DP state is (pos, tight), where pos is the current bit being processed (starting from 0, the most significant, up to n-1). The 'tight' flag indicates whether the bits processed so far are exactly equal to m's bits. If tight is True, then the current bit can't exceed m's corresponding bit.\n\nThe DP table will store the maximum sum achievable up to the current bit, given the tight state.\n\nThe transitions are as follows:\n\nAt each step, for the current position pos and tight state t, we can choose to set the current bit to 0 or 1.\n\nIf t is True, the current bit can be at most the corresponding bit of m.\n\nSo, for each possible choice of bit (0 or 1):\n\n- If current bit is less than m's bit at pos: then, in the next step, the tight state becomes False, because the number is now less than m's prefix.\n\n- If current bit is equal to m's bit: then, tight remains True.\n\n- If current bit is greater than m's bit: not allowed, since x must be <= m.\n\nSo, for each choice of current bit, we can determine whether it's allowed based on the tight state.\n\nOnce the choice is made, the new tight state is determined, and the sum is updated by adding a_i if the current bit is set.\n\nThe initial state is pos=0, tight=True, sum=0.\n\nThe final answer is the maximum sum found across all states where pos == n (all bits processed), considering both tight states (True and False).\n\nNow, implementing this requires handling each bit from 0 to n-1, and for each state, considering the possible choices.\n\nBut with n up to 105, the DP table size is manageable. The number of states is 105 (positions) × 2 (tight states) = 210, which is small.\n\nSo, the steps to implement this:\n\n1. Read the input: n, the array a, and the binary string s.\n\n2. Convert the binary string s into an array of bits, where bits[i] is the value of the i-th bit of m (0 or 1). Also, compute the value of m as an integer for verification.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to process each bit as needed without converting m to an integer because m can be up to 2^105, which is way beyond standard data types.\n\nSo, for each position pos in 0..n-1, the corresponding bit in m is s[pos], which is '0' or '1'.\n\nSo, the bits can be stored as a list, where bits[pos] is True (1) or False (0).\n\n3. Initialize the DP table. Since we can represent the DP as a dictionary or a 2D array, but for efficiency, perhaps using a dictionary where the keys are (pos, tight) and the values are the maximum sum achievable.\n\nBut for n=105, a 2D array is feasible. Let's use a 2D array where dp[tight][pos] represents the maximum sum up to pos when the tight state is t (t can be 0 or 1).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent it as a list of lists, where dp is a 2 x (n+1) array. But since we process each position in order, perhaps a 2-row DP is sufficient, updating it as we go.\n\nWait, another approach is to use two variables: current_dp and next_dp. For each position, we keep track of the maximum sums for each tight state.\n\nYes, that might be more efficient. So, for each position, we process the current state and compute the next state.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\nInitialize a DP array where dp_prev is a dictionary mapping tight states to the maximum sum. Initially, at position 0, tight is True, sum is 0.\n\nWait, no. At position 0, which is the most significant bit, the tight state is True, and the sum is 0.\n\nWait, perhaps for each position, we have a dictionary that holds the maximum sum for each possible tight state.\n\nSo, for position 0:\n\n- Tight is True, sum is 0.\n\nThen, for each position from 0 to n-1:\n\n   For each possible tight state in the current DP (0 or 1):\n\n      For each possible choice of current bit (0 or 1):\n\n         If the current tight is True, then the current bit can't exceed m's bit at this position.\n\n         So, check if the current choice is allowed.\n\n         If allowed, compute the new tight state.\n\n         Compute the new sum by adding a[pos] if the current bit is set.\n\n         Update the next DP state (new_pos = pos+1) with the new tight state and new sum, keeping the maximum sum for each (tight, new_pos) pair.\n\nSo, for each position, we process the current state and generate the next state.\n\nAt the end, after processing all positions, the maximum sum is the maximum value across all possible tight states in the final DP.\n\nWait, but how do the positions map? Let me think.\n\nThe positions start at 0 (most significant) and go up to n-1 (least significant). So, for each position, the current bit is bits[pos], which is s[pos].\n\nSo, for each position, the current bit is bits[pos].\n\nSo, during the processing, for each position, we consider the possible choices of setting the current bit.\n\nNow, for the DP, perhaps using a list of dictionaries is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, since n is small, perhaps using a 2D array for each tight state, for each position.\n\nSo, for each position i, we can have two variables: max_sum_true and max_sum_false, representing the maximum sum achievable when the tight state is True or False.\n\nInitially, before processing any bits, the tight state is True, sum is 0.\n\nSo, for position 0:\n\nmax_sum_true = 0 (if we don't set the bit)\nmax_sum_false = -infinity (not possible yet)\n\nWait, no. Because at position 0, the only possible state is tight=True, sum=0.\n\nBut when processing each position, we can consider adding 0 or 1, and compute the next state.\n\nWait, perhaps for each position i, we have two possible states: tight and not tight.\n\nFor each state, we track the maximum sum.\n\nSo, for each i, we have:\n\nprev_tight: the maximum sum when the state is tight.\n\nprev_not_tight: the maximum sum when the state is not tight.\n\nAt each step, for each possible state, we explore adding 0 or 1.\n\nLet's think through an example.\n\nSuppose at position i, for prev_tight = 5, and prev_not_tight = 10.\n\nFor the next position i+1, we can choose to set the bit to 0 or 1, depending on the current tight state.\n\nSo, for each state in prev_tight and prev_not_tight, process the possible choices.\n\nLet me try to outline the code.\n\nInitialize dp as a list of two elements: dp[0] is the sum when tight is True, dp[1] is when tight is False. Initially, dp = [-infinity, -infinity], except dp[0] at position 0 is 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial state is before processing any bits, and for position 0, the tight is True, and sum is 0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the DP as a list of two elements, representing the current state for tight and not tight.\n\nSo, initially, before processing any bits, we have:\n\ncurrent_dp = [0, -infinity]\n\nWait, but for position 0, the first bit is considered. So, for each possible choice of the first bit (0 or 1), we compute the new state.\n\nSo, let's proceed.\n\nFor each position i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   For each possible state in the previous step (tight or not):\n\n      For each possible choice of the current bit (0 or 1):\n\n         If the previous state is tight:\n\n             If the current bit is 1:\n\n                 if current_bit > m's bit at i: not allowed.\n\n                 else:\n\n                     if current_bit < m's bit at i:\n\n                         new_tight = False\n\n                         new_sum = prev_sum + a[i] (since the bit is set)\n\n                     else:\n\n                         new_tight = True\n\n                         new_sum = prev_sum + a[i]\n\n             elif current_bit is 0:\n\n                 if current_bit < m's bit at i:\n\n                     new_tight = False\n\n                     new_sum = prev_sum + 0\n\n                 else:\n\n                     new_tight = True\n\n                     new_sum = prev_sum + 0\n\n         else:\n\n             // previous state is not tight, so any choice is allowed.\n\n             new_tight = False\n\n             if current_bit is 1:\n\n                 new_sum = prev_sum + a[i]\n\n             else:\n\n                 new_sum = prev_sum\n\n         // Now, update the next_dp for new_tight and new_sum.\n\n         if new_tight is False:\n\n             next_dp[new_tight] = max(next_dp[new_tight], new_sum)\n\n         else:\n\n             next_dp[new_tight] = max(next_dp[new_tight], new_sum)\n\nSo, for each position, we process each possible state and each possible bit choice.\n\nAfter processing all positions, the maximum sum is the maximum of all possible sums in the final DP states.\n\nSo, the code would involve initializing the DP, processing each bit, and updating the DP accordingly.\n\nNow, let's think about how to represent the DP.\n\nWe can represent the DP as a list of two elements: [max_sum_tight, max_sum_not_tight].\n\nInitially, for position -1 (before processing any bits), the tight state is True with sum 0, and not tight is invalid (so perhaps represented as negative infinity).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the initial state as having tight=True and sum=0, and the other state as not reachable.\n\nSo, for each position i, we process the current DP and compute the next DP.\n\nNow, let's think about the steps in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead a as a list of integers.\n\nRead s as a string.\n\nCompute the bits of m: for each position i in 0..n-1, the bit is s[i] == '1'.\n\nThen, initialize the DP:\n\nprev_tight = 0  # sum when tight is True, starting before processing any bits\nprev_not_tight = -infinity  # sum when tight is False, which is not possible before any bits\n\nThen, for each i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   current_m_bit = bits[i]\n\n   # Initialize the next_dp variables\n   new_tight_max = -infinity\n   new_not_tight_max = -infinity\n\n   # For each possible state in the previous step\n   # First, consider the tight state\n   if prev_tight != -infinity:\n       # Try setting current bit to 0\n       if 0 <= current_m_bit:\n           # 0 is allowed\n           sum0 = prev_tight + (a[i] if 0 == 1 else 0)  # Wait, no: if the current bit is set, add a[i]\n           # Wait, no: the current bit is 0, so it's not set.

The above code isn't correct. Because for each possible state, you have to consider all possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to, for each state (tight or not), and for each possible bit choice, compute the new state and update the next state's maximum.\n\nSo, for each i, the current DP has two possible states: tight and not tight.\n\nFor each state, we can explore both 0 and 1 for the current bit.\n\nSo, for each state in the current DP:\n\n   if the state is tight:\n\n       for bit_choice in 0, 1:\n\n           if bit_choice > m's bit at i: skip\n\n           else:\n\n               new_tight = (bit_choice == m's bit at i)\n\n               new_sum = current_sum + a[i] if bit_choice is 1 else current_sum\n\n               update next_dp[new_tight] to be the maximum between its current value and new_sum\n\n   else:\n\n       for bit_choice in 0, 1:\n\n           new_tight = False\n\n           new_sum = current_sum + a[i] if bit_choice is 1 else current_sum\n\n           update next_dp[new_tight] to be the maximum between its current value and new_sum\n\nSo, in code, for each i:\n\n   for each state in [tight, not tight]:\n\n       if the state is tight:\n\n           for bit in 0, 1:\n\n               if bit > m's_bit_i: continue\n\n               new_tight_flag = (bit == m's_bit_i)\n\n               add_to_sum = a[i] if bit == 1 else 0\n\n               new_sum = current_sum + add_to_sum\n\n               if new_sum > next_dp[new_tight_flag]:\n\n                   next_dp[new_tight_flag] = new_sum\n\n       else:\n\n           for bit in 0, 1:\n\n               add_to_sum = a[i] if bit == 1 else 0\n\n               new_sum = current_sum + add_to_sum\n\n               # since the state is not tight, new state is also not tight\n\n               if new_sum > next_dp[False]:\n\n                   next_dp[False] = new_sum\n\nWait, but this isn't quite right. Because for the not tight state, the current_sum could be anything, and the new_sum is computed based on the current_sum and the current bit choice.\n\nBut in the initial state, prev_not_tight is -infinity, so for the first iteration, only the tight state is processed.\n\nSo, perhaps the code needs to handle each state separately.\n\nLet me try to structure this properly.\n\nInitialize:\n\nprev_tight = 0  # sum is 0, state is tight\n\nprev_not_tight = -infinity  # state is not tight, but initially not possible\n\nfor each i in 0 to n-1:\n\n    m_bit = (s[i] == '1')  # boolean indicating whether the bit is set in m\n\n    new_tight_max = -infinity\n\n    new_not_tight_max = -infinity\n\n    # Process the tight state\n\n    if prev_tight != -infinity:\n\n        # Try setting bit to 0\n\n        sum0 = prev_tight + (a[i] if 0 == 1 else 0)\n\n        if 0 < m_bit:\n\n            # after setting 0, the new state is not tight\n\n            if sum0 > new_not_tight_max:\n\n                new_not_tight_max = sum0\n\n        else:\n\n            # 0 == m_bit, so new state is tight\n\n            if sum0 > new_tight_max:\n\n                new_tight_max = sum0\n\n        # Try setting bit to 1\n\n        if 1 <= m_bit:\n\n            sum1 = prev_tight + a[i]\n\n            if 1 < m_bit:\n\n                # new state is not tight\n\n                if sum1 > new_not_tight_max:\n\n                    new_not_tight_max = sum1\n\n            else:\n\n                # new state is tight\n\n                if sum1 > new_tight_max:\n\n                    new_tight_max = sum1\n\n    # Process the not tight state\n\n    if prev_not_tight != -infinity:\n\n        # Any bit choice is allowed, but state remains not tight\n\n        # Try 0\n\n        sum0 = prev_not_tight + (a[i] if 0 == 1 else 0)\n\n        if sum0 > new_not_tight_max:\n\n            new_not_tight_max = sum0\n\n        # Try 1\n\n        sum1 = prev_not_tight + a[i]\n\n        if sum1 > new_not_tight_max:\n\n            new_not_tight_max = sum1\n\n    # Update prev for next iteration\n\n    prev_tight, prev_not_tight = new_tight_max, new_not_tight_max\n\nAfter processing all bits, the maximum sum is the maximum of the two possible states: prev_tight and prev_not_tight.\n\nSo, the final result is max(prev_tight, prev_not_tight).\n\nBut wait, after processing all bits, the tight state can still be True or False.\n\nSo, the maximum sum is the maximum of the two.\n\nBut what if one of them is -infinity? That means that state is not possible.\n\nIn that case, the maximum is taken over the possible states.\n\nSo, in code, after processing all bits:\n\nresult = max(prev_tight, prev_not_tight)\n\nBut what if both are -infinity? That can't happen, because x can be 0, which is always allowed.\n\nWait, no: for n=0, but the problem says n >=1.\n\nWait, n is given as >=1, so for all cases, at least some x exists.\n\nSo, the maximum sum is the maximum of the two, but considering that one might be -infinity.\n\nWait, but in the initial state, prev_tight is 0, which is valid.\n\nSo, for each position, the prev_tight and prev_not_tight are updated, and after n steps, the maximum sum is the maximum of the two.\n\nBut let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=2\n\na = [3,8]\n\ns = '10'\n\nWhich is bits[0] = '1' (so m's bit 0 is 1), bits[1] = '0' (so m's bit 1 is 0).\n\nProcessing each position:\n\ni=0 (first bit, s[0]='1'):\n\nprev_tight =0, prev_not_tight=-infty.\n\nProcess tight state:\n\nsum0: 0 + (a[0] if 0 is set, which is 3 if 0 is 1? Wait, wait: no.\n\nWait, wait, for the current bit, the value is 0 or 1.\n\nEach time, for each bit choice (0 or 1), if the bit is set, add a[i] to the sum.\n\nSo, for i=0, a[i] is 3.\n\nCase 1: tight state is True, sum is 0.\n\nTry setting bit to 0:\n\nsum0 = 0 + 0 = 0.\n\nSince m's bit is 1, 0 < 1 → new state is not tight.\n\nSo, new_not_tight_max becomes max(-infty, 0) → 0.\n\nThen, try setting bit to 1:\n\nsum1 = 0 + 3 = 3.\n\nSince 1 == m's bit, new_tight_max is max(-infty, 3) → 3.\n\nSo, after processing tight state:\n\nnew_tight_max=3, new_not_tight_max=0.\n\nThen, process not_tight state:\n\nprev_not_tight is -infty, so nothing is done.\n\nSo, after i=0:\n\nprev_tight=3, prev_not_tight=0.\n\ni=1 (second bit, s[1]='0'):\n\nm_bit is 0.\n\nProcess tight state (sum=3):\n\nTry setting bit to 0:\n\nsum0 = 3 + 0 =3.\n\nSince 0 == m_bit (0), new_tight_max becomes 3.\n\nAlso, since 0 == m_bit, the new state is tight.\n\nSet new_tight_max to 3.\n\nThen, try setting bit to 1:\n\nIs 1 <= m_bit (0)?
