Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Leha who wants to split his vacation into two parts using two vouchers. The goal is to find the minimal total cost of such two vouchers that don't overlap and their durations add up exactly to x.\n\nHmm, let's break down the problem.\n\nSo, each voucher has a start day li, end day ri, and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. We need to choose two different vouchers i and j such that:\n\n1. Their durations sum to exactly x.\n2. They don't intersect. That means either the end of one is before the start of the other, or vice versa.\n3. The total cost is as small as possible.\n\nIf no such pair exists, we output -1.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this efficiently. Since n can be up to 2*10^5, any O(n^2) approach would be way too slow. So we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the steps needed.\n\nStep 1: For each voucher, compute its duration (d_i = ri - li + 1). Then, for each voucher i, we need to find a voucher j where d_j = x - d_i. Because the sum of durations must be x.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers, storing their duration and cost.\n- For each voucher i, calculate required duration s = x - d_i.\n- Then, look for vouchers j with duration s, and check if they don't overlap with i.\n- Among all such valid pairs, find the one with minimal cost.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nSince for each i, we need to find j's with d_j = s, but also non-overlapping with i, perhaps we can group vouchers by their duration.\n\nSo, create a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of all vouchers with that duration. But wait, each voucher has a start and end time, so for a given s, we can have multiple j's. But we need to find j's that are compatible with i.\n\nWait, but for each i, we need to find j's that are either entirely before i or entirely after.\n\nSo for each voucher i, which has duration d_i, the required s is x - d_i. If s is negative, then it's impossible. So we can skip those cases.\n\nThen, for each j in the group of duration s, we need to check if j's interval doesn't overlap with i's.\n\nBut how to quickly find the minimal cost for such j's that are compatible with i?\n\nHmm, perhaps for each duration s, we can precompute some structures that allow us to quickly find the minimal cost j that is either entirely before or after a given i.\n\nLet's think about this.\n\nFor each voucher i, when looking for j's of duration s:\n\nCase 1: j ends before i starts. So j's ri < i's li.\n\nCase 2: j starts after i ends. So j's li > i's ri.\n\nWe need to find the minimal cost among all j's that satisfy either case 1 or 2.\n\nSo for each group of s, we can pre-process two arrays:\n\n- The minimal cost for vouchers ending before a certain time.\n- The minimal cost for vouchers starting after a certain time.\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, for each s, we can sort the vouchers in a way that allows us to query quickly.\n\nAnother idea: for each s, have two sorted lists:\n\n- One sorted by their end times, and another by their start times.\n\nBut I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, perhaps for each s, we can keep track of all vouchers with that duration, and for each, store their start and end times along with their cost.\n\nThen, for each voucher i, to find j's with duration s, we can do the following:\n\n1. Find all j's where j's end < i's start.\n\n   For these j's, the earliest end is less than i's start. So, for each j, j's end <= i's start - 1.\n\n   So, for all such j's, we can find the minimal cost.\n\n2. Find all j's where j's start > i's end.\n\n   For these j's, j's start >= i's end + 1.\n\n   So, for all such j's, find the minimal cost.\n\nThen, the minimal cost for this i is the minimum between the minimal costs from case 1 and case 2.\n\nSo the question is, how to efficiently query the minimal cost for j's satisfying either condition.\n\nSo for each s, we can have:\n\n- A list of j's sorted by their end time. Then, for a given i, we can perform a binary search to find all j's with end <= i.start - 1, and among those, find the one with minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for j's sorted by their start time, we can find those with start >= i.end + 1, and find the minimal cost among them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each s, we can pre-sort the j's in two ways:\n\n- Sorted by end time, and for each end time, keep track of the minimal cost up to that point.\n\n- Similarly, sorted by start time, and for each start time, keep track of the minimal cost from that point onwards.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: For each s, maintain two separate lists:\n\n- List A: all j's sorted by end time. For each j in this list, we can compute the prefix minimal cost up to each point. So, for any i, the maximum end allowed is i.start - 1. We can use binary search to find the largest j's end <= i.start - 1. Then, the minimal cost in the prefix up to that index is the candidate for case 1.\n\n- List B: all j's sorted by start time. For each j in this list, we can compute the suffix minimal cost from each point onwards. So, for any i, the minimal start allowed is i.end + 1. We can find the first j's start >= i.end + 1 using binary search, and then the minimal cost in the suffix from that index is the candidate for case 2.\n\nThis way, for each i, we can quickly get the minimal cost from case 1 and case 2, and take the overall minimal.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers, grouping them by their duration.\n\n   For each duration s in the keys of the group:\n\n   a. Sort the list of j's by end time.\n\n   b. Compute a prefix_min array, where prefix_min[k] is the minimal cost from j[0] to j[k].\n\n   c. Sort the same list by start time.\n\n   d. Compute a suffix_min array, where suffix_min[k] is the minimal cost from j[k] to the end.\n\n2. For each voucher i:\n\n   a. Compute s = x - d_i. If s is negative, skip.\n\n   b. Check if there are any vouchers with duration s.\n\n      i. If not, continue.\n\n   c. For case 1: find j's where j.end <= i.start - 1.\n\n      i. In the sorted end list, perform a binary search to find the largest j.end <= i.start - 1.\n\n      ii. If such j exists, get the minimal cost from prefix_min up to that index.\n\n   d. For case 2: find j's where j.start >= i.end + 1.\n\n      i. In the sorted start list, perform a binary search to find the first j.start >= i.end + 1.\n\n      ii. If such j exists, get the minimal cost from suffix_min starting at that index.\n\n   e. Take the minimal cost from case 1 and case 2, and compare with the current global minimum.\n\n3. After processing all i's, the minimal cost found is the answer.\n\nNow, implementing this requires careful handling of the data structures.\n\nBut what about the edge cases? For example, when i and j are completely overlapping, which is allowed as long as they are non-overlapping.\n\nWait, no. The condition is that they do not intersect. So, either j ends before i starts, or i ends before j starts.\n\nSo, for case 1, j can end on the same day as i's start minus one. For case 2, j can start on the same day as i's end plus one.\n\nSo, in code terms:\n\nj_end <= i_start - 1 --> case 1.\n\ni_end + 1 <= j_start --> case 2.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, considering the steps:\n\n- Preprocessing:\n\n   For each s, collect all j's.\n\n   For each s, sort j's by end time. Then compute prefix_min.\n\n   Also, sort j's by start time. Then compute suffix_min.\n\n- For each i:\n\n   Calculate s = x - d_i.\n\n   If s is not present in the groups, skip.\n\n   Else:\n\n      For case 1:\n\n         Use binary search on the end-sorted list to find the last j where j_end <= i_li - 1.\n\n         If any, get the minimal cost from prefix_min up to that index.\n\n      For case 2:\n\n         Use binary search on the start-sorted list to find the first j where j_li >= i_ri + 1.\n\n         If any, get the minimal cost from suffix_min from that index.\n\n      Take the minimal between the two cases (if any exist), and update the global min.\n\nSo, now, the main challenge is to implement this correctly and efficiently.\n\nNow, thinking about the data structures:\n\nEach group for s will have:\n\n- end_sorted: list of j's sorted by j_ri.\n\n- prefix_min: array where prefix_min[k] = min cost from 0 to k.\n\n- start_sorted: list of j's sorted by j_li.\n\n- suffix_min: array where suffix_min[k] = min cost from k to end.\n\nSo, during preprocessing:\n\nFor each s:\n\n   group = [all j's with duration s]\n\n   group.sort(key=lambda x: x[ri]) # sort by end time\n\n   end_sorted = group\n\n   # compute prefix_min\n   prefix_min = []\n   if end_sorted:\n       prefix_min.append(end_sorted[0].cost)\n       for i in range(1, len(end_sorted)):\n           prefix_min.append(min(prefix_min[i-1], end_sorted[i].cost))\n   else:\n       prefix_min = []\n\n   group.sort(key=lambda x: x[li]) # sort by start time\n   start_sorted = group\n\n   # compute suffix_min\n   suffix_min = [0]*len(start_sorted)\n   if start_sorted:\n       suffix_min[-1] = start_sorted[-1].cost\n       for i in range(len(start_sorted)-2, -1, -1):\n           suffix_min[i] = min(start_sorted[i].cost, suffix_min[i+1])\n   else:\n       suffix_min = []\n\n   # store in the groups dictionary\n   groups[s] = {\n       'end_sorted': end_sorted,\n       'prefix_min': prefix_min,\n       'start_sorted': start_sorted,\n       'suffix_min': suffix_min\n   }\n\nWait, but in Python, since the vouchers are objects, perhaps we should represent them as tuples or a class. But for efficiency, perhaps just store their li, ri, cost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent each voucher as a tuple (li, ri, cost). So for each group, we can have lists of tuples.\n\nSo, for each voucher, we'll have (li, ri, cost).\n\nThen, for each s:\n\ngroup = list of tuples (li, ri, cost) with duration s.\n\nOnce sorted by end time, each element is (ri, ...), but for binary searching, perhaps we can extract the ri and compare.\n\nWait, but for binary search, we need a key that can be compared. So, perhaps, for the end_sorted list, we can create a separate list of end times, and a separate list of costs.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to create separate lists for end times and costs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the end_sorted list, we can have a list of (ri, cost). Then, when performing binary search, we can extract the ri values.\n\nBut in Python, the bisect module can work with a key function, but I think it's easier to have a separate list of keys (like ri) and a corresponding list of costs.\n\nWait, perhaps for each group, we can have:\n\n- end_list: list of (ri, cost) sorted by ri.\n\n- start_list: list of (li, cost) sorted by li.\n\nAnd also, for each group, precompute the prefix and suffix minima.\n\nWait, but how to handle the binary search.\n\nHmm, perhaps for the end_list, we can have a list of tuples (ri, cost), sorted by ri. Then, for a given i_li, we can find the maximum ri in end_list that is <= i_li - 1.\n\nIn Python, we can use bisect_right to find the insertion point of (i_li -1) in the end_list's ri values.\n\nWait, but the bisect module works on a list that is already sorted. So, for each group, we can have a separate list called 'ends' which contains the ri values, and 'costs_end' which contains the costs in the same order.\n\nSimilarly, for the start_list, we can have 'starts' and 'costs_start' lists, sorted by li.\n\nSo, for each group s:\n\nend_list = sorted list of (ri, cost) by ri.\n\nends = [x[0] for x in end_list]\n\ncosts_end = [x[1] for x in end_list]\n\nSimilarly, start_list = sorted list of (li, cost) by li.\n\nstarts = [x[0] for x in start_list]\n\ncosts_start = [x[1] for x in start_list]\n\nAlso, compute prefix_min and suffix_min.\n\nSo, during preprocessing for each s:\n\n- For end_list:\n\n   Create ends and costs_end.\n\n   Compute prefix_min_end: an array where prefix_min_end[k] is the minimal cost up to the k-th element in end_list.\n\n- For start_list:\n\n   Create starts and costs_start.\n\n   Compute suffix_min_start: an array where suffix_min_start[k] is the minimal cost from k to end.\n\nThis way, for any i, when looking for case 1, we can:\n\nbinary search in ends to find the rightmost ri <= i_li -1.\n\nIf found, say at position idx, then the minimal cost is prefix_min_end[idx].\n\nSimilarly, for case 2, binary search starts to find the leftmost li >= i_ri + 1.\n\nIf found at position idx, the minimal cost is suffix_min_start[idx].\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nRead all vouchers.\n\nCompute their durations.\n\nGroup them by duration.\n\nFor each group, preprocess as described.\n\nThen, for each voucher i:\n\nCompute s = x - d_i.\n\nIf s not in groups, skip.\n\nElse:\n\n   For case 1:\n\n      target = i_li -1\n\n      Use bisect_right on ends to find idx.\n\n      If idx > 0:\n\n          min_case1 = prefix_min_end[idx-1]\n\n      else:\n\n          min_case1 = infinity\n\n   For case 2:\n\n      target = i_ri + 1\n\n      Use bisect_left on starts to find idx.\n\n      If idx < len(starts):\n\n          min_case2 = suffix_min_start[idx]\n\n      else:\n\n          min_case2 = infinity\n\n   total_min = min(min_case1, min_case2)\n\n   if total_min is less than current global min, update.\n\nAfter processing all i's, if global min is still infinity, output -1. Else, output the global min.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut wait, how to handle the initial step of grouping and preprocessing.\n\nLet me outline the code steps.\n\nRead n and x.\n\nvouchers = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    l, r, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, c) )\n\nCompute durations:\n\ndurations = [r - l + 1 for l, r, c in vouchers]\n\nCreate groups: a dictionary mapping duration to a structure containing end_list, start_list, etc.\n\ngroups = {}\n\nfor voucher in vouchers:\n\n    l, r, c = voucher\n\n    d = r - l + 1\n\n    if d not in groups:\n\n        groups[d] = {\n\n            'end_list': [],  # list of (r, c) sorted by r\n\n            'start_list': [],  # list of (l, c) sorted by l\n\n            'prefix_min': [],\n\n            'suffix_min': []\n\n        }\n\n    groups[d]['end_list'].append( (r, c) )\n\n    groups[d]['start_list'].append( (l, c) )\n\nThen, for each d in groups:\n\nend_list = sorted(groups[d]['end_list'], key=lambda x: x[0])\n\nstart_list = sorted(groups[d]['start_list'], key=lambda x: x[0])\n\nNow, create the ends, costs_end, prefix_min_end.\n\nends = [x[0] for x in end_list]\n\ncosts_end = [x[1] for x in end_list]\n\nprefix_min_end = []\n\ncurrent_min = float('inf')\n\nfor cost in costs_end:\n\n    current_min = min(current_min, cost)\n\n    prefix_min_end.append(current_min)\n\nSimilarly for the start_list:\n\nstarts = [x[0] for x in start_list]\n\ncosts_start = [x[1] for x in start_list]\n\nsuffix_min_start = [0]*len(costs_start)\n\nif len(costs_start) > 0:\n\n    suffix_min_start[-1] = costs_start[-1]\n\n    for i in range(len(costs_start)-2, -1, -1):\n\n        suffix_min_start[i] = min(costs_start[i], suffix_min_start[i+1])\n\nSo, now, for each d in groups, we have the necessary structures.\n\nNow, for each voucher i in vouchers:\n\nl_i, r_i, c_i = i\n\nd_i = r_i - l_i + 1\n\ns = x - d_i\n\nif s < 0:\n\n    continue\n\nif s not in groups:\n\n    continue\n\ngroup = groups[s]\n\n# case 1: j ends before i starts\n\ntarget_end = l_i - 1\n\n# find in group's end_list the largest r <= target_end\n\n# using bisect_right on ends\n\nimport bisect\n\nidx = bisect.bisect_right(ends, target_end)\n\nif idx > 0:\n\n    min_case1 = prefix_min_end[idx-1]\n\nelse:\n\n    min_case1 = float('inf')\n\n# case 2: j starts after i ends\n\ntarget_start = r_i + 1\n\n# find in group's start_list the first l >= target_start\n\nidx = bisect.bisect_left(starts, target_start)\n\nif idx < len(starts):\n\n    min_case2 = suffix_min_start[idx]\n\nelse:\n\n    min_case2 = float('inf')\n\ntotal_min = min(min_case1, min_case2)\n\nif total_min < global_min:\n\n    global_min = total_min\n\nWait, but initially, the global_min is set to infinity.\n\nSo, after processing all vouchers, if global_min is still infinity, output -1.\n\nElse, output global_min.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 → duration 3\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2\n\nSo, the vouchers are:\n\nVoucher 0: (1,3,4), duration 3\n\nVoucher 1: (1,2,5), duration 2\n\nVoucher 2: (5,6,1), duration 2\n\nVoucher 3: (1,2,4), duration 2\n\nSo, group 3 has one voucher, group 2 has three vouchers.\n\nFor group 3:\n\nend_list: [(3,4)]\n\nstarts: [(1,4)]\n\nFor group 2:\n\nend_list: sorted by r:\n\nvoucher1: r=2, c=5\n\nvoucher3: r=2, c=4\n\nvoucher2: r=6, c=1\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, vouchers in group 2 are vouchers 1,3,2. Or wait, group 2's start_list and end_list are built as per the original order?\n\nNo, because the start_list is built as per the original vouchers' l, then sorted by l. So for group 2, the start_list is:\n\nvoucher1: l=1, c=5\n\nvoucher3: l=1, c=4\n\nvoucher2: l=5, c=1\n\nWhen sorted by l, they become:\n\n(1,5), (1,4), (5,1).\n\nSimilarly, end_list is sorted by r.\n\nvoucher1's r=2, voucher3's r=2, voucher2's r=6.\n\nSo end_list is [(2,5), (2,4), (6,1)].\n\nSo, ends = [2,2,6]\n\ncosts_end = [5,4,1]\n\nprefix_min_end is [5, 4, 1].\n\nSimilarly, starts are [1,1,5], costs_start = [5,4,1].\n\nsuffix_min_start is [1,1,1].\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, the suffix_min_start is computed as:\n\nAt index 2 (last), it's 1.\n\nAt index 1, it's min(4, suffix_min_start[2]=1) → 1.\n\nAt index 0, min(5, suffix_min_start[1]=1) → 1.\n\nSo suffix_min_start is [1,1,1].\n\nWait, no. Wait, the suffix_min_start for group 2 is:\n\nThe list is [5,4,1].\n\nProcessing from the end:\n\ni=2: suffix_min_start[2] = 1.\n\ni=1: min(4, 1) = 1.\n\ni=0: min(5, 1) = 1.\n\nSo the suffix_min_start is [1, 1, 1].\n\nWait, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's process each voucher i.\n\nFor voucher 0 (d=3): s =5-3=2.\n\nCheck group 2.\n\nCase1: j must end <= i_li -1 = 1-1=0.\n\nLooking into group 2's end_list, ends are [2,2,6]. All are >0, so no j in case1.\n\nCase2: j must start >= i_ri +1=3+1=4.\n\nLooking into group 2's starts, which are [1,1,5]. The first j with l >=4 is at index 2 (l=5).\n\nSo, min_case2 is suffix_min_start[2] =1.\n\nSo total_min is 1.\n\nGlobal_min is updated to 1.\n\nNext voucher: i=1, (1,2,5), d=2. s=5-2=3.\n\nCheck group 3: does it have any vouchers?\n\nYes, one voucher with r=3, c=4.\n\nCase1: j must end <= 1-1=0. Again, j's r is 3>0, so no.\n\nCase2: j must start >=2+1=3.\n\nGroup 3's starts are [1]. So no j's with l>=3. So case2 no.\n\nThus, no contribution.\n\nNext voucher: i=2 (5,6,1), d=2. s=3.\n\nGroup 3 has one voucher. Its start is 1, which is <5. So case1: j's r <=5-1=4.\n\nj's r is 3<=4. So case1 is possible.\n\nmin_case1 is prefix_min_end[0] =4.\n\ncase2: j's start >=6+1=7. Group3's starts are 1<7, so no.\n\nTotal_min is min(4, inf) →4.\n\nCompare to global_min 1: no change.\n\nNext voucher: i=3 (1,2,4), d=2. s=3.\n\nSame as voucher1: case1 is j's r <=0, no.\n\ncase2: j's start >=2+1=3.\n\nGroup3's starts are 1<3, no.\n\nThus, no contribution.\n\nSo the minimal is 1? But wait, wait in the sample input, the expected output is 5.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the correct pair is voucher 0 (duration 3) and voucher2 (duration 2), sum is 5.\n\nBut according to my code logic, when processing voucher0 (d=3), s=2.\n\nGroup2 has vouchers:\n\nvoucher1: (1,2,5), (2,5)\n\nvoucher3: (1,2,4), (2,4)\n\nvoucher2: (5,6,1), (6,1).\n\nSo, for case2, j's start >=4.\n\nLooking into group2's starts, which are [1,1,5].\n\nSo, the first j with l >=4 is at index 2 (l=5).\n\nThe suffix_min_start[2] is 1, which is the cost of voucher2.\n\nSo, total_min is 4+1=5? Or wait, in the code, the case2 min is 1, but the code is adding that to i's cost? No, wait, no: the code is finding j's cost, and the sum is i's cost + j's cost.\n\nWait, no. Oh no! Oh right, the code is adding i's cost and j's cost. Because for each i, the code is considering j's cost, and then adding it to i's cost? Or wait, no. Wait, no.\n\nWait, the code for each i is looking for j's, and the j's cost is considered. Then, the minimal j's cost is added to i's cost.\n\nWait, no, that's wrong.\n\nBecause in the code above, when processing i, for case1, min_case1 is the minimal cost of j's that can be paired with i.\n\nSimilarly for case2, min_case2 is the minimal cost of j's.\n\nSo the total cost is i's cost + min_case1 (or i's cost + min_case2).\n\nWait, no, in the code, the 'c_i' is i's cost, and min_case1 is the minimal j's cost. So the total cost is c_i + min_case1.\n\nWait, no, no. Because in the code, for each i, the j's are being considered, and their cost is the minimal j's cost. So the code computes the minimal j's cost for case1 and case2, then adds i's cost to that.\n\nWait, that's incorrect. Because the code is adding i's cost and j's cost.\n\nWait, no, wait:\n\nIn the code, for each i, the j's cost is the minimal cost for j's that can pair with i. So the total cost is i's cost + j's cost.\n\nWait, no, no. Because the code is adding the j's cost, but not the i's cost.\n\nWait, no, in the code, when i is processed, the j's cost is considered. So the code is calculating the minimal j's cost for each case, and then the total is i's cost + that j's cost.\n\nWait, no, because in the code, min_case1 is the minimal j's cost, and then the code says 'if any, get the minimal cost from prefix_min_end up to that index'.\n\nSo, the code is assuming that the minimal j's cost is the one to add to i's cost.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Because the code is considering j's cost as the only cost, but the total cost is i's cost plus j's cost.\n\nSo, the code is wrong here.\n\nAh, that's a big mistake.\n\nSo, in the code, for each i, the j's cost is taken, and added to i's cost.\n\nWait, no, in the code, the j's cost is the minimal, and then the code adds it to i's cost.\n\nBut that's not correct. Because the code is considering the cost of j's, not the sum.\n\nSo, the code is incorrectly computing the total cost as min_case1 (which is j's cost) instead of i's cost plus j's cost.\n\nSo, that's a bug.\n\nSo, how to fix this?\n\nWe need to track for each j, the cost of j, and when it is compatible with i, add i's cost and j's cost.\n\nBut that would require, for each i, to consider the j's cost, and add it to i's cost, then take the minimal.\n\nWait, but that's not efficient.\n\nWait, no, because for each i, the j's cost is the cost of the voucher j. So the total cost is i.c + j.c.\n\nSo, when processing i, for case1 and case2, we need to find the minimal j.c, and then the total is i.c + j.c.\n\nWait, but the code is currently taking min_case1 as the minimal j.c, but the code is adding that to i.c, which is wrong.\n\nWait, no, the code is not doing that. The code is, for each i, considering the j's cost, and then adding it to i's cost? No, the code is not adding.\n\nWait, looking back at the code:\n\nIn the code, for each i:\n\nCompute s = x - d_i.\n\nFor case1, if any j exists, get min_case1 = minimal cost of j's that meet the condition.\n\nSimilarly for case2.\n\nThen, total_min = min(min_case1, min_case2).\n\nBut wait, no, the code is not adding anything. So the code is just comparing the j's cost, but the actual total cost is i's cost + j's cost.\n\nSo, the code is incorrect.\n\nAh, that's a major bug.\n\nSo, to fix this, for each j, when considering it as a candidate, the cost is j's cost, and the total cost is i's cost + j's cost.\n\nSo, the code needs to track, for each case, the minimal (i.cost + j.cost).\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nHmm, this complicates things because for each j, you have to add i's cost.\n\nBut that's not feasible, as for each i, you can have up to O(n) j's, leading to O(n^2) time.\n\nWait, but perhaps the way to handle this is to precompute for each group the j's cost, and for each i, when considering j's, the minimal (i.cost + j.cost) is needed.\n\nBut that's difficult because it's dependent on i's cost.\n\nAlternative approach: For each j, precompute its cost, and when looking for i's that can pair with j, but that might not be efficient.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial approach was incorrect, and a better way is needed.\n\nLet me rethink.\n\nAn alternative approach is to for each pair of vouchers i and j that have durations adding up to x and are non-overlapping, compute the sum of their costs, and find the minimal sum.\n\nBut with n up to 2e5, this is O(n^2), which is impossible.\n\nSo, we need a way to avoid checking all pairs.\n\nSo, going back to the initial approach, but correcting the bug.\n\nThe initial approach groups vouchers by their duration, and for each i, finds j's of duration s=x-d_i, non-overlapping with i, and finds the minimal j's cost. Then, the total cost is i's cost plus j's cost.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, the code is only considering j's cost, not i's cost. So the code is incorrect.\n\nSo, the code should compute the minimal (i's cost + j's cost) for the cases where j's are compatible.\n\nThus, the code for case1 and case2 should track the minimal (i's cost + j's cost), not just j's cost.\n\nSo, in the code, for each i, when considering j's:\n\nFor case1:\n\n   min_case1 = min over j's in case1 of (i.cost + j.cost)\n\nSimilarly for case2.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nSo, for each group s, in addition to the minimal cost, we need the minimal (i.cost + j.cost) for each i.\n\nBut that's not possible because i's cost varies for each i.\n\nHmm, this seems tricky.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nInstead of precomputing the minimal cost for j's, perhaps precompute for each group s, the minimal cost, and when considering i, the minimal (i.cost + minimal_j_cost).\n\nBut that's not correct because the minimal j's cost may not be compatible with i.\n\nBut perhaps, for each group s, we can track the minimal cost of j's, and then for i, the minimal possible is i.cost + minimal_j_cost, provided that j's are compatible.\n\nBut that's incorrect because the j's with minimal cost may not be compatible with i.\n\nSo, for example, the minimal j's cost in group s may have a j that overlaps with i, but another j with higher cost is compatible.\n\nSo, that approach would miss the correct j.\n\nThus, it's not possible.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the initial approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nFor each group s, for each j in group s, precompute j's (start, end, cost).\n\nThen, for each i, compute s = x - d_i, and look for j's in group s that are compatible with i.\n\nBut how to find j's quickly that are compatible.\n\nThis would require for each i, to query group s's j's that are either before i or after i.\n\nBut even this approach is O(n) per i, which is O(n^2) time, which is too slow.\n\nThus, the problem is challenging.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWhat if we precompute for each group s, the minimal cost of j's that can be paired with any i.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for each group s, we can precompute two additional variables:\n\n- The minimal cost of j's that end before a certain time.\n\n- The minimal cost of j's that start after a certain time.\n\nBut again, it's unclear how to represent this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each group s, we can pre-sort the j's by end time, and for each j in this sorted list, keep track of the minimal cost up to that point. So, for any i, when looking for j's ending before i starts, the minimal j's cost is the minimal cost in the prefix up to the largest j.end <= i.start -1.\n\nSimilarly, for j's starting after i ends, the minimal j's cost is the minimal in the suffix starting from the first j.start >= i.end +1.\n\nBut then, the total cost for i is i's cost plus the minimal j's cost.\n\nSo, for each i, the minimal total cost would be the minimal of (i's cost + min_case1) and (i's cost + min_case2).\n\nBut wait, no, because the minimal j's cost is already the minimal possible, so adding i's cost gives the minimal possible sum for that case.\n\nBut in the initial approach, the code was considering only j's cost, not adding i's cost.\n\nSo, the correction is to compute min_case1 and min_case2 as the minimal j's cost, and then the total cost is i's cost + min_case1 (or + min_case2).\n\nThus, the code needs to be modified accordingly.\n\nSo, in the code, for each i:\n\ns = x - d_i.\n\nFor case1:\n\nif idx >0:\n\n   min_case1_j_cost = prefix_min_end[idx-1]\n\n   total_cost = i's cost + j's cost.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the voucher j has costi, which is the cost of voucher j.\n\nSo, the code is trying to find the minimal sum of the two vouchers.\n\nThus, for the two vouchers i and j, the total cost is the sum of their individual costs.\n\nThus, for each pair (i,j), the cost is i's cost plus j's cost.\n\nSo, the code should find the minimal sum of cost_i + costj.\n\nThus, in the code, for each voucher i and j, the sum is costi + costj.\n\nWait, no, wait, no.\n\nWait, each voucher has a costi. So, for voucher i, the cost is costi, which is the cost of the voucher.\n\nSo, the sum of the two vouchers' costs is cost_i + cost_j.\n\nWait, no, wait, each voucher has a costi, and the total cost is the sum of the two vouchers' costi.\n\nSo, for voucher i and j, the total cost is costi + costj.\n\nThus, for the code, when selecting j's, the minimal cost is the sum of the two's costs.\n\nThus, in the code, for each voucher j, costi is the cost of voucher j.\n\nSo, when considering j, the cost is costi + costj.\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Wait, the code is looking for i and j, but i and j are the vouchers, so the cost is the sum of the two vouchers.\n\nThus, the total cost is cost_i + costj.\n\nWait, no. Because the vouchers are i and j, which are two vouchers, and the total cost is the sum of their costi.\n\nWait, the problem says that the sum of the durations is x, and the total cost is the sum of costi of vouchers i and j.\n\nSo, the minimal total cost is the sum of the two vouchers' costi.\n\nWait, no. The problem statement says that the sum of the two durations is exactly x.\n\nWait, each voucher i is characterized by li, ri, costi.\n\nSo, the duration is ri - li +1.\n\nThus, the cost of the voucher is costi.\n\nSo, for two vouchers i and j, the total cost is costi + costj.\n\nThus, in the code, when i and j are chosen, the total cost is costi + costj.\n\nThus, when",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers whose combined duration equals exactly `x` days and whose total cost is minimized. The approach involves efficiently searching for valid pairs of vouchers using preprocessing and binary search.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, group all vouchers by their duration. This allows us to quickly access all vouchers with a specific duration when needed.\n2. **Preprocess Each Group**: For each duration group, preprocess the vouchers to create sorted lists by their end times and start times. Additionally, compute prefix minimum costs for end-sorted lists and suffix minimum costs for start-sorted lists.\n3. **Efficient Search for Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, determine the required duration of the second voucher to sum up to `x`. Use binary search on the preprocessed lists to find the minimal cost of compatible vouchers that either end before the current voucher starts or start after the current voucher ends.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(data[idx])\n    x = int(data[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(data[idx])\n        r = int(data[idx+1])\n        c = int(data[idx+2])\n        vouchers.append((l, r, c))\n        idx += 3\n    \n    # Group vouchers by their duration\n    groups = {}\n    for l, r, c in vouchers:\n        d = r - l + 1\n        if d not in groups:\n            groups[d] = {\n                'end_list': [],\n                'start_list': [],\n                'prefix_min': [],\n                'suffix_min': []\n            }\n        groups[d]['end_list'].append((r, c))\n        groups[d]['start_list'].append((l, c))\n    \n    # Preprocess each group\n    for d in groups:\n        # Process end_list\n        end_list = sorted(groups[d]['end_list'], key=lambda x: x[0])\n        ends = [x[0] for x in end_list]\n        costs_end = [x[1] for x in end_list]\n        groups[d]['end_list'] = end_list\n        groups[d]['ends'] = ends\n        groups[d]['costs_end'] = costs_end\n        \n        # Compute prefix_min_end\n        prefix_min_end = []\n        if end_list:\n            current_min = float('inf')\n            for cost in costs_end:\n                current_min = min(current_min, cost)\n                prefix_min_end.append(current_min)\n        else:\n            prefix_min_end = []\n        \n        # Process start_list\n        start_list = sorted(groups[d]['start_list'], key=lambda x: x[0])\n        starts = [x[0] for x in start_list]\n        costs_start = [x[1] for x in start_list]\n        groups[d]['start_list'] = start_list\n        groups[d]['starts'] = starts\n        groups[d]['costs_start'] = costs_start\n        \n        # Compute suffix_min_start\n        suffix_min_start = []\n        if start_list:\n            current_min = float('inf')\n            for cost in reversed(costs_start):\n                current_min = min(current_min, cost)\n                suffix_min_start.insert(0, current_min)\n        else:\n            suffix_min_start = []\n    \n    # Now process each voucher to find the minimal cost\n    global_min = float('inf')\n    for l_i, r_i, c_i in vouchers:\n        d_i = r_i - l_i + 1\n        s = x - d_i\n        if s < 0:\n            continue\n        if s not in groups:\n            continue\n        \n        group = groups[s]\n        # Case 1: j ends <= l_i - 1\n        target_end = l_i - 1\n        idx_case1 = bisect.bisect_right(group['ends'], target_end)\n        if idx_case1 > 0:\n            min_j_cost = group['prefix_min'][idx_case1-1]\n            total_cost = c_i + min_j_cost\n            if total_cost < global_min:\n                global_min = total_cost\n        else:\n            pass\n        \n        # Case 2: j starts >= r_i + 1\n        target_start = r_i + 1\n        idx_case2 = bisect.bisect_left(group['starts'], target_start)\n        if idx_case2 < len(group['starts']):\n            min_j_cost = group['suffix_min'][idx_case2]\n            total_cost = c_i + min_j_cost\n            if total_cost < global_min:\n                global_min = total_cost\n        else:\n            pass\n    \n    if global_min != float('inf'):\n        print(global_min)\n    else:\n        print(-1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration to facilitate efficient searching later.\n3. **Preprocessing**: Each group of vouchers is preprocessed to sort by end and start times, and to compute prefix and suffix minimum costs.\n4. **Searching for Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, the required duration of the second voucher is computed.
