He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to check if a given string can be formed in a specific way. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem says that the string is built by three people: A, B, and C. A creates a string of some 'a's, then B appends some 'b's, and finally C appends some 'c's. But there are certain conditions:\n\n1. After A and B, the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n2. C appends 'c's such that the count of 'c's is equal to either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's (could be both).\n\nAdditionally, the order matters. The string must first have all the 'a's, followed by 'b's, then 'c's. So the structure is a sequence of a's, then b's, then c's, without any mixing.\n\nSo my task is to determine whether a given string S satisfies these conditions.\n\nLet me think about the steps to check the string.\n\nFirst, I'll need to parse the string into its a, b, c counts, but also check their order.\n\nSo step 1: Split the string into three parts: a's, then b's, then c's. If the string has any other letters interleaved, it's invalid.\n\nHow to do that? Maybe iterate through each character and group them into a's, then b's, then c's. If during this process, after seeing a 'b', we encounter an 'a' again, that's invalid. Similarly, if after 'c's, another letter comes, it's invalid.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, C appends c's at the end. So the entire string should consist of a's, followed by b's, followed by c's. So the string should not have any a after a b, and no b after a c.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Check that the string starts with some a's.\n- Then transitions to b's.\n- Then transitions to c's.\n- No other transitions allowed.\n\nSo for example, a valid string would look like \"aaaabbbbc\" but something like \"aaabacb\" would be invalid because it has a 'c' in between 'a's and 'b's.\n\nSo how to implement this? We can track the current expected character. Initially, it's 'a'. Once we hit a 'b', the expected becomes 'b'. Once we hit a 'c', the expected becomes 'c'.\n\nWait, no, more accurately:\n\nWe can keep track of the phase. The phases are:\n\n1. All 'a's.\n2. After some 'a's, all 'b's.\n3. After some 'b's, all 'c's.\n\nSo once the phase changes from 'a' to 'b', any subsequent 'a's are invalid. Similarly, once the phase changes to 'c's, any other letters are invalid.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Iterate through each character in the string.\n- Keep track of the current allowed letters. Initially, only 'a's are allowed.\n- Once a 'b' is encountered, the allowed letters switch to 'b's only.\n- Once a 'c' is encountered, allowed letters switch to 'c's only.\n- Also, after the transition to 'c's, no other letters are allowed.\n\nBut wait, what about when the string starts with 'b'? That's impossible because A must have added at least one 'a' before B added any 'b's. So the string cannot start with 'b' or 'c'. Similarly, it cannot have any 'c's before 'b's.\n\nSo the first character must be 'a', and then after some 'a's, a 'b' can come. Then after some 'b's, a 'c' can come.\n\nSo let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Check that the string is non-empty.\n2. The first character must be 'a'; else, invalid.\n3. Iterate through the string:\n   a. While the current character is 'a', continue and count the number of a's.\n   b. When a 'b' is found, ensure that we haven't seen any 'b's or 'c's before. Count the number of b's.\n   c. When a 'c' is found, ensure that we've already seen some 'b's and no 'c's before. Count the number of c's.\n4. Ensure that all characters after the initial a's and b's are c's.\n5. Check that the counts of a's and b's are at least 1 each.\n6. Check that the number of c's is equal to either the number of a's or the number of b's.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, after A and B, C appends some c's. So the string after B",
