Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to check if the pile of letters can exactly form the two names given. Hmm, right.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again. Oh right, the input consists of three lines: guest's name, host's name, and the pile. We need to check if the pile is a rearrangement of all the letters from both names combined, without any extra letters.\n\nSo, the approach here is probably to count the frequency of each letter in the guest and host names, combine them, and then compare with the frequency counts from the pile. If they match exactly, output YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, but how do I handle case sensitivity? The problem says all lines are uppercase letters, so no issues there.\n\nFirst step: Read the three lines. Let's say guest = first line, host = second, pile = third.\n\nThen, concatenate guest and host into a single string. Then, count each character's occurrence. Similarly, count the characters in the pile.\n\nIf these two counts are the same, then output YES; else, NO.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, in Python, I can use the collections.Counter class for this. But wait, what about the order? No, because Counter compares the counts regardless of order.\n\nBut wait, another thing: the sum of the lengths of guest and host should equal the length of the pile. Otherwise, it's impossible. So as a first check, I can compute len(guest + host) == len(pile). If not, immediately return NO.\n\nThat would save some computation time, especially for cases where the total letters don't match.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three lines.\n2. Concatenate guest and host.\n3. Check if the combined length equals the pile's length. If not, output NO.\n4. Else, create Counter objects for both the combined guest+host and the pile.\n5. Compare the Counters. If equal, output YES; else, NO.\n\nThat sounds solid.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nCase 1: One of the names is empty. Well, according to the problem statement, each line is not empty. So we don't need to handle that.\n\nCase 2: All letters are the same. Like guest is \"AAA\", host is \"A\", pile is \"AAAA\". Then, combining gives \"AAAA\" which has 4 As, but pile is 4 As—so yes.\n\nAnother case: guest is \"AB\", host is \"CD\", pile is \"ACBD\"—this should be yes.\n\nWhat if the pile is longer or shorter than the sum? Then the initial length check will catch it.\n\nWhat about different letters? For example, guest has 'a' and 'b', host has 'c' and 'd'; pile has all four. Should be yes.\n\nSo, the plan seems to cover these.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\nRead the three lines. So, something like:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the guest is 'SANTACLAUS', host is 'DEDMOROZ', and pile is 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER'. Wait, no—the sample input shows the three lines as the inputs. So, when reading, we need to read each line correctly.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the first line is 'SANTACLAUS', second is 'DEDMOROZ', third is 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER'? Or wait, no—looking at the sample input, it's written as a list of three strings, each representing the three lines.\n\nWait, perhaps in the actual input, the three lines are given as separate lines. So, in code, I can read them via input().strip() for each line.\n\nWait, but wait—what about newlines in the pile? Because in the sample input, the pile is given as a single string with \\n separated. Oh, no, the third line is a single string, but in reality, the third line is a single line, but when printed, the \\n may have been represented as part of it. Wait, no—the input is three lines, each possibly containing letters and newlines. Wait, no. Each of the three lines is a single line of text, but perhaps in the input, the third line includes newlines as part of the letters? No, because the problem statement says each line is not empty and contains only uppercase letters. So the third line is just a string of letters, perhaps including newlines as part of the pile. Wait, no, the third line is the pile, which is a collection of letters found at the door. So the pile is a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the pile of letters found at the door can be rearranged to form both the guest's name and the host's name exactly. This means that the pile must contain exactly the same number of each letter as the combined names of the guest and host without any extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the three lines of input which include the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names:** Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Check Lengths:** Verify if the combined length of the guest's and host's names is equal to the length of the pile. If not, print \"NO\" immediately.\n4. **Count Letters:** Use a frequency counter to count the occurrences of each letter in both the combined names and the pile.\n5. **Compare Counts:** Check if the frequency counts of the combined names match those of the pile. If they do, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Read the three lines from input\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\n# Combine the guest and host names\ncombined = guest + host\n\n# Check if the total number of characters matches\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Create frequency counters for both combined and pile\n    counter_combined = Counter(combined)\n    counter_pile = Counter(pile)\n    \n    # Compare the two counters\n    if counter_combined == counter_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The code reads three lines of input corresponding to the guest's name, host's name, and the pile of letters.\n- **Combining Names:** The guest's and host's names are concatenated to form a single string.\n- **Length Check:** Before proceeding, the code checks if the total number of characters in the combined names matches the length of the pile. This is an early exit condition to quickly handle cases where the lengths don't match.\n- **Frequency Counting:** Using `collections.Counter`, the code counts the occurrences of each character in both the combined names and the pile.\n- **Comparison:** The frequency counts are compared. If they are identical, it means the pile can be rearranged to form both names exactly, so \"YES\" is printed. Otherwise, \"NO\" is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures that the solution is both correct and optimal.",
