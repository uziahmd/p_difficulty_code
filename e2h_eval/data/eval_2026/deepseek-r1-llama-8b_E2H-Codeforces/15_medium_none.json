They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck but let's try to think through it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about a playoff tournament with 2^n teams. Each game in the tournament has certain rules based on the string s provided. The string s has n characters, each being '0' or '1'. For each phase i, if s_i is '0', then in that phase, each match is won by the lower-skilled team. If it's '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nOur task is to find all x (from 1 to 2^n) such that there exists a permutation p of skills where x is the champion.\n\nHmm, so the key here is to model how the tournament progresses and see for each x whether it's possible for x to be the winner under some permutation p.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the tournament works. It's a single-elimination bracket. Each round, the teams are paired, and each pair plays a game. The winner moves on, and this continues until one remains.\n\nThe phases: the first phase has 2^(n-1) games, the next phase has 2^(n-2), and so on, until the nth phase has one game. So for phase i (1-based?), or perhaps 0-based? Wait, the problem says s has length n, and each s_i corresponds to the ith phase. So for example, when n=3, the phases are 3, 2, 1 games respectively.\n\nWait, no: the first phase is 2^(n-1) games, which for n=3 is 4 games. The second phase is 2^(n-2) = 2 games, third phase is 1 game. So s is of length 3, and s_0 is the result of the first phase (4 games), s_1 is the second phase (2 games), s_2 is the third phase (1 game).\n\nSo for each phase i (from 0 to n-1), the number of games is 2^(n - i - 1). Wait, maybe I should index it correctly. Let me clarify:\n\nSuppose n=3. Then the tournament has 7 games:\n\nPhase 1: 4 games (teams split into pairs)\nPhase 2: 2 games\nPhase 3: 1 game\n\nAnd s has length 3, each character corresponding to each phase.\n\nSo for s[i], i ranges from 0 to 2. So s[0] is phase 1, s[1] is phase 2, s[2] is phase 3.\n\nEach phase determines how the winners move forward.\n\nNow, the challenge is to determine for each x, can x be the champion given some permutation p where the tournament results match the s string.\n\nI need to find all such x's.\n\nApproach:\n\nI think the way to model this is to represent the tournament as a series of rounds, and for each round, determine how the teams must be arranged so that the outcomes align with s. Then, for each possible x, check if it's possible for x to reach the top after all these rounds.\n\nBut since n can be up to 18, 2^18 is 262144, which is manageable with some smart approach, but trying all possibilities isn't feasible.\n\nWait, but what's the maximum possible size of the tournament? For n=18, it's 262144 teams, but processing each of them for each possible scenario might be computationally heavy. So we need an efficient way.\n\nAlternative idea: the permutation p is such that the tournament's outcome aligns with s. So, for each phase, the structure of the bracket must allow certain teams to pass through based on their relative strengths and the phase's rule.\n\nPerhaps, for each position in the tournament bracket, we can model the required constraints on the teams in that sub-bracket.\n\nAnother thought: the tournament can be represented as a binary tree. Each node represents a match, and the leaves are the initial teams. Each internal node has two children, representing the two matches that feed into it. The root is the final match.\n\nFor a team x to win the tournament, it must win all its matches in each phase. But each phase's match depends on the structure of the bracket.\n\nWait, but the bracket structure is fixed. Oh wait, noâ€”because the initial pairing is such that team 1 plays 2, 3 plays 4, etc. So the initial bracket is determined by the order of the teams.\n\nBut since p is a permutation, the initial bracket could be any arrangement as long as the teams are ordered in pairs. Or wait, no. The initial bracket is fixed as 1 vs 2, 3 vs4, etc., regardless of p. Because p is the skill levels, not the initial order.\n\nWait, the initial order of the teams is fixed as 1,2,3,...,2^n. So the initial phase is team 1 vs 2, team 3 vs4, etc. So the bracket structure is fixed based on the initial team order.\n\nSo the bracket is like a binary tree where the leaves are the initial teams ordered as 1,2,3,...,2^n. Each level of the tree represents a phase.\n\nIn each phase, the winners from the previous phase are grouped into new pairs, and each pair plays again.\n\nWait, no. The bracket is more like a single-elimination tournament where each phase reduces the number of teams by half. So each phase has 2^(n-i) games, and the next phase has 2^(n-i-1) teams.\n\nBut for the purpose of the problem, the bracket is determined by the initial pairing. So the initial pairs are (1,2), (3,4), ..., (2^{n-1}-1, 2^{n-1} ), assuming even numbers.\n\nThen, for each phase, the winners form the next set of pairs, and so on.\n\nSo for the permutation p, the actual skill values are assigned to the initial teams, but the bracket is fixed.\n\nWait, but the problem says that p is a permutation of 1 to 2^n. So the initial order is fixed as 1,2,3,...,2^n, but their skills are permuted according to p. So, for example, team 1 has skill p_1, team 2 has p_2, etc.\n\nWait no, wait: the problem states that the i-th team has skill p_i. So the initial order is fixed as team 1, team 2, etc., and their skill levels are given by p as a permutation.\n\nSo the initial bracket is team 1 vs team 2, team 3 vs team4, etc., but their skills are determined by p.\n\nSo the bracket is fixed in terms of the initial pairings, but the actual teams' skills are determined by p.\n\nSo, for each phase, the pairings are determined by the initial bracket. So the structure of the tournament is fixed, but the skills vary.\n\nThus, for a particular permutation p, the tournament's outcome is determined by who wins each match, based on the rules s.\n\nSo the problem is: for each x (from 1 to 2^n), does there exist a permutation p such that x ends up as the champion?\n\nWe need to find all such x.\n\nHmm. So, the approach is to model for each x, can it be the root of the tournament's binary tree, given the s string.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative approach: for each x, determine whether it can reach the final position (win all required matches) under the given s.\n\nBut the structure of the bracket is fixed, so for x to win, in each phase, it must win its match, which depends on the other team's skill and the s rules.\n\nWait, perhaps for x to be the champion, it must satisfy certain conditions in each of the phases it participates in.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose we have a function f(x) that returns True if x can be the champion given the current phase rules.\n\nBut how do the phase rules affect x's path?\n\nWait, for x to win the tournament, it must win each match in every phase it's involved in. Each phase corresponds to a certain level of the tournament.\n\nSo, for example, in phase 0 (the first phase with 2^{n-1} games), x is in one of the 2^{n-1} games. It must win that match, then proceed to the next phase, and so on.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this as a series of constraints that x must satisfy at each phase.\n\nEach phase i (from 0 to n-1) has a rule s[i]. So, during phase i, the way teams are paired and the winners are determined depends on this rule.\n\nWait, but the pairing in each phase is determined by the previous phase's winners. So, the structure of the bracket is fixed, but the grouping into pairs changes at each phase.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe we can model the tournament as a binary tree, where each non-leaf node represents a match, and the leaves are the initial teams.\n\nEach match has a rule (based on s[i]) that determines which of the two children will win.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, it must be the winner of the root node. To determine whether this is possible, we can traverse the tournament bracket and see if x can satisfy all the necessary match rules.\n\nWait, but how to model the bracket structure based on the initial pairings?\n\nBecause the initial bracket is fixed, the structure of the tree is determined by the initial pairings.\n\nFor example, the initial matches are (1,2), (3,4), ..., (2^{n-1}-1, 2^{n-1}).\n\nThen, the next phase's matches are between the winners of (1,2) and (3,4), and so on.\n\nSo, the bracket is a binary tree where each match is between two winners from the previous phase.\n\nThus, the root is the final match, which is between two winners from the penultimate phase.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, it must win all matches along the path from the leaf to the root.\n\nEach match along this path is determined by the s rules.\n\nBut how do we model the path from x to the root?\n\nWait, perhaps each x belongs to a specific path in the tournament bracket. For example, in the first phase, x is in a group of two teams, and their match's outcome depends on s[0].\n\nThen, the winner of that group proceeds to the next phase, where they face another group's winner, and so on.\n\nSo, the key is to determine for each x whether it can reach the top by winning all necessary matches, considering the s rules.\n\nBut how to model this for each x efficiently?\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the tournament's structure is fixed, so for each x, the path it takes through the bracket is determined by the initial position of x and the structure of the bracket.\n\nBut the bracket structure is fixed as per the initial pairings. So, for example, in the first phase, x is paired with either x+1 (if x is odd) or x-1 (if x is even), right? Because the initial pairings are 1&2, 3&4, etc.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial pairings are 1 vs 2, 3 vs4, etc. So if x is 1, it's paired with 2; if x is 3, paired with 4, etc.\n\nSo, for each x, its initial opponent is x+1 if x is odd, else x-1.\n\nWait, but this is only for the first phase. Then, in the next phase, the winners are grouped into new pairs, which depends on their initial positions.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model the tournament as a binary tree, where each node represents a match in a certain phase, and the leaves are the initial teams.\n\nThen, for x to be the champion, it must be the winner of all the matches along the path from its leaf to the root.\n\nEach match has a rule (s[i]), so for each match along the path, x must satisfy the condition that either x beats the other participant (based on s[i]).\n\nBut how do we find the path for x?\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, the path to the root is determined by the initial bracket. So, for x, the path is fixed as per the bracket structure.\n\nSo, for example, for x=5, in the first phase, it's in a pair with 6. They play, and depending on s[0], either 5 or 6 proceeds to the next phase.\n\nIn the next phase, the winners from each initial pair form new pairs. So, for example, if 5 and 6 were both winners, they would be paired with the winners from the next initial pair, say 7 and 8, and so on.\n\nBut modeling this for each x is tricky because the path depends on the outcomes of the matches in previous phases.\n\nBut since we're trying to find whether x can be the champion, we can model it by ensuring that in each match along x's path, x wins when it's supposed to.\n\nWait, but the problem is that for x to proceed to the next phase, it must win its match, but the opponent in each phase is determined by the bracket.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to model this is to represent the tournament as a binary tree, and for each x, compute the required constraints for x to win all matches on its path to the root, based on the s rules.\n\nIf for all the matches along x's path, x can satisfy the required condition, then x is a winning integer.\n\nSo, how to build this binary tree?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial bracket can be represented as a list of matches, each of which has a rule.\n\nBut building the entire tree for n=18 would be impossible because 2^18 is 262144 nodes, which is manageable but requires a lot of memory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent the tournament as a structure where each node knows which matches it must win.\n\nWait, perhaps for each x, we can determine the set of matches it must win, and for each of those matches, determine the required condition based on the s rules.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother angle: each phase of the tournament can be considered as a certain level of the binary tree. For each phase, the number of games is 2^{n - i}, where i is the phase index (starting from 0).\n\nWait, no: earlier analysis said that for phase i (0-based), the number of games is 2^{n - i - 1}. For example, for n=3, phase 0 has 4 games, phase 1 has 2, phase 2 has 1.\n\nSo, for each phase i, the number of games is 2^{n - i - 1}.\n\nEach game in phase i corresponds to a match in the tournament bracket, and the winners of that game proceed to the next phase, i+1.\n\nThus, the tournament can be viewed as a binary tree where each node represents a match, and the leaves are the initial teams. Each non-leaf node has two children, which are the matches that feed into it.\n\nSo, for x to become champion, it must win all the matches along the path from its leaf to the root.\n\nEach match has a rule (s[j], j being the phase index). So for each match along the path, x must satisfy the condition that, given the rule, it can win that match.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to checking for each x whether, along the path from its leaf to the root, all the matches can be won by x given the s rules.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the binary tree structure of the tournament, where each node is a match, and each leaf corresponds to a team (initially 1, 2, ..., 2^n).\n\n2. For each x, find the path from its leaf to the root.\n\n3. For each match in this path, check if x can win it, given the s rule of that phase.\n\n4. If for all matches in the path, x can win, then x is a winning integer.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nWait, but for n=18, 2^18=262144, which is manageable but requires careful handling.\n\nBut building the entire binary tree is impractical. Instead, perhaps we can represent each match in a way that allows us to compute the path for x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the path for x by traversing the bracket step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is similar to a binary heap's structure. For example, for a tournament bracket with 8 teams, the initial phase has 4 matches, each producing a winner. The next phase has 2 matches, each involving two winners from the previous phase, and so on.\n\nSo, for each x, to find the path, we can simulate the progression through each phase.\n\nEach phase i has 2^{n - i - 1} matches. The teams that proceed from phase i are the winners of those matches.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, it must be the winner of its initial match in phase 0, then the winner of its next match in phase 1, and so on, until phase n-1.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\nFor each x, simulate the progression through each phase, determining the required opponents and the rules for each phase.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the process for x:\n\n1. In phase 0, x is in a group of 2 teams. The group is determined by x's initial position.\n\n   For example, if x is 5, then in phase 0, it's paired with 6.\n\n   They play a match: the winner proceeds to phase 1.\n\n   The rule for phase 0 is s[0]. So, if s[0] is '0', then the lower-skilled team wins. If s[0] is '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n\n   Thus, for x to proceed, x must be able to win this match. That is, if s[0] is '1', x must be higher than its opponent. If s[0] is '0', x must be lower than its opponent.\n\n   So, for x to proceed, it must satisfy:\n\n   if s[0] == '1': x > opponent\n\n   else: x < opponent\n\n   So, the opponent is determined by the initial pairing.\n\n   So, the opponent in phase 0 is x+1 if x is odd, else x-1.\n\n   For example, x=1: opponent is 2.\n\n   x=3: opponent is4.\n\n   So, in phase 0, x's opponent is x+1 if x is odd, else x-1.\n\n   So, for phase 0, the opponent is x + 1 if x is odd, else x - 1.\n\n   So, the condition is:\n\n   if s[0] == '1', x must be larger than the opponent.\n\n   Else, x must be smaller.\n\n   So, for x to pass phase 0, it's required that x satisfies that condition.\n\n   So, let's compute the required condition for phase 0.\n\n2. Once x passes phase 0, it proceeds to phase 1.\n\n   Now, in phase 1, the number of games is 2^{n-1 - 1} = 2^{n-2}.\n\n   The number of participants is 2^{n-1}.\n\n   These participants are the winners of phase 0's matches.\n\n   So, the bracket is structured as follows: the winners of the initial 2^{n-1} matches (each from phase 0) are grouped into 2^{n-1 -1} groups of two, and each group plays a match in phase 1.\n\n   Wait, no: phase 1 has 2^{n-1} participants (since phase 0 had 2^{n-1} games, each producing one winner). These participants are then paired into 2^{n-2} matches.\n\n   So, the question is, which group does x belong to in phase 1.\n\n   How to determine x's group in phase 1.\n\n   Since the bracket is fixed, the next phase's pairings are determined by the initial positions of the winners.\n\n   For example, in phase 0, the winners are in order, and in phase 1, they are paired sequentially.\n\n   So, the winners from phase 0 are ordered as per their initial positions.\n\n   So, for phase 1, the first two winners form a match, the next two form another, and so on.\n\n   So, for x, after phase 0, it's part of a group of two winners, which are consecutive in the list of phase 0 winners.\n\n   So, the group in phase 1 is determined by the position of x in the phase 0 winners.\n\n   So, for example, in phase 0, the winners are ordered as per their initial positions.\n\n   So, the first group in phase 1 is winner 1 and 2, the next is 3 and4, etc.\n\n   Wait, no: the phase 1 matches are between the winners of phase 0, which are in order. So, the first match in phase 1 is between the winner of the first pair in phase 0 and the winner of the second pair, and so on.\n\n   So, for example, phase 0 has 4 matches:\n\n   (1 vs2) winner is A, (3 vs4) winner is B, (5 vs6) winner is C, (7 vs8) winner is D.\n\n   Phase 1 has 2 matches: A vs B, C vs D.\n\n   So, for x, say x is A (winner of 1 vs2), then in phase 1, it is paired with B (winner of 3 vs4). So, x's phase 1 match is against the next team in the phase 0 winners' order.\n\n   So, for phase 1, the group consists of two consecutive winners from phase 0.\n\n   So, the group in phase 1 is determined by the index of x in the phase 0 winners.\n\n   So, to find the group in phase 1, we need to know the index of x in the phase 0 winners.\n\n   But since x is the winner of its own phase 0 match, the phase 0 winners are ordered as per their initial positions.\n\n   So, for example, if x is 5, it's the winner of 5 vs6. So, in phase 0, the order of winners is [A1, A2, A3, A4], where A1 is the winner of 1 vs2, A2 is 3 vs4, etc.\n\n   So, the phase 1 groups are (A1, A2), (A3, A4), etc.\n\n   So, for x, after phase 0, its position in the phase 0 winners' list determines its group in phase 1.\n\n   For example, if x is A1, it's in group 0 of phase 1.\n\n   So, the phase 1 group is determined by (x's initial position - 1) / 2.\n\n   Because in phase 0, the winners are ordered as 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. So, for x, the index in phase 0 winners is (x's initial position -1)/2.\n\n   So, for x=5, initial position is 5, so (5-1)/2 = 2, so index 2 in phase 0 winners.\n\n   Then, phase 1 groups are formed as pairs of consecutive indices: 0 and 1, 2 and3, etc.\n\n   So, x's phase 1 group is floor(index / 2).\n\n   So, for x=5, index=2, group 1.\n\n   So, phase 1's group is determined by (index) // 2.\n\n   So, the group number is (index) // 2.\n\n   Thus, for phase 1, the opponent is the other team in the same group.\n\n   So, for x, in phase 1, the opponent is the other winner in the same group.\n\n   So, for phase 1, the opponent is the next or previous winner in the phase 0 winners' list.\n\n   So, to find the opponent in phase 1, we need to find the other winner in x's phase 1 group.\n\n   Thus, the process is:\n\n   - For phase 0, determine x's initial opponent.\n\n   - Check if x can win phase 0.\n\n   - Then, find x's position in phase 0's winners list.\n\n   - Determine phase 1's group.\n\n   - Find x's opponent in phase 1's group.\n\n   - Check if x can win phase 1.\n\n   And so on for each phase.\n\n   So, for each phase i, we need to:\n\n   1. Determine the group x is in for phase i.\n\n   2. Determine x's opponent in that group.\n\n   3. Check if x can win the match in phase i, given s[i].\n\n   4. If yes, proceed to phase i+1.\n\n   5. Repeat until phase n-1 is processed.\n\n   So, the question is, how to model this for each x.\n\n   The main steps for each x are:\n\n   - For each phase i from 0 to n-1:\n\n      a. Determine the current group x is in for phase i.\n\n      b. Find x's opponent in this group.\n\n      c. Based on s[i], determine if x can win the match.\n\n      d. If not, x cannot be champion.\n\n      e. Else, proceed to next phase.\n\n   Now, the challenge is to implement this for each x, but for n=18, 2^18 is 262,144, which is manageable if each x's check is O(n) time.\n\n   So, the plan is:\n\n   For each x from 1 to 2^n:\n\n      For i from 0 to n-1:\n\n         Determine if x can win phase i.\n\n         If any phase i is not possible, break and mark x as not a winner.\n\n      If x passes all phases, add to the winning integers.\n\n   Now, the key is to compute for each phase i, the opponent of x in that phase.\n\n   How to compute the opponent in each phase?\n\n   Let's think recursively.\n\n   For phase i, the opponent is determined by the grouping of the winners from phase i-1.\n\n   So, for phase 0, the opponent is known.\n\n   For phase 1, the opponent is in the same group as x in phase 0's winners.\n\n   Similarly, for phase 2, the opponent is in the same subgroup of phase 1's winners.\n\n   So, for each phase i, the group is determined by the index of x in phase i-1's winners.\n\n   So, the algorithm for phase i is:\n\n   - After phase i-1, x is in a certain group (say, group g in phase i-1).\n\n   - The group size is 2, so in phase i, x's group is g//2.\n\n   Wait, perhaps for each phase, the group is determined by the index of x in the previous phase's winners.\n\n   For phase i, the group is determined by the index in phase i-1 divided by 2.\n\n   So, for each phase, the opponent is the other member of the group.\n\n   So, for phase i, the group is the index of x in phase i-1's winners divided by 2.\n\n   Thus, the steps to find the opponent for phase i:\n\n   1. For phase 0, the opponent is x_initial_opponent.\n\n   2. For phase i>0, the opponent is the other team in the group determined by x's position in phase i-1.\n\n   So, the process for each phase i is:\n\n   a. Compute x's position in phase i-1's winners.\n\n   b. Divide by 2 to get the group index in phase i.\n\n   c. The group consists of two teams: the other team is the one in the same group.\n\n   So, the problem is to find, for each phase i, the opponent of x in that phase.\n\n   So, to model this, perhaps we can precompute for each x and phase i, what the opponent would be.\n\n   Alternatively, during the simulation for x, we can track the current group and thus find the opponent.\n\n   So, for each phase i:\n\n   1. Determine the current group of x.\n\n   2. The opponent is the other team in that group.\n\n   So, how to compute the opponent for each phase.\n\n   Let's think about the phase transitions.\n\n   Let me try to model this for phase 0 and 1.\n\n   For phase 0:\n\n   Opponent is x+1 if x is odd, else x-1.\n\n   So, for x=5 (odd), opponent is 6.\n\n   Now, for phase 1:\n\n   The group in phase 0 is determined by x's index in phase 0's winners.\n\n   For phase 0's winners, the order is 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. So, x=5 is in position 3 (if 0-based? Or 2 if 0-based? Wait, 5 is the third team in the initial 8 teams, so 0-based index 2.)\n\n   So, phase 0's winners are in order 1,3,5,7 (assuming 4 winners for n=3). So, x=5 is at index 2 in phase 0's winners.\n\n   So, phase 1's group is index 2 // 2 = 1. So, group 1 contains the winners at indices 2 and 3 of phase 0.\n\n   So, the other member is the winner at index 3, which is 7.\n\n   So, for x=5, in phase 1, the opponent is 7.\n\n   So, the process is:\n\n   For phase 1, the group is determined by x's position in phase 0's winners (index) divided by 2.\n\n   So, the other member is the winner at index 2*group + 1.\n\n   So, for group g, the other member is the winner at index 2g +1.\n\n   Wait, perhaps the other member is the winner in the same group.\n\n   So, for x, in phase i, the group is determined by the index in phase i-1 divided by 2^i.\n\n   Hmm, perhaps a better way is to model the groups as a binary tree, where each group is a node, and each node has two children.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps for each x, we can model the path it takes through the bracket, and for each phase, determine the required opponent.\n\n   So, the algorithm for x is as follows:\n\n   Initialize current_group as 0.\n\n   For each phase i from 0 to n-1:\n\n      if i ==0:\n\n          opponent = x_initial_opponent (x+1 if x is odd, else x-1)\n\n      else:\n\n          group_in_previous_phase = current_group // 2\n\n          current_group = group_in_previous_phase\n\n          opponent = the other team in the group_in_previous_phase.\n\n      Determine if x can beat opponent in phase i.\n\n      If not, x is not a winner.\n\n      Else, proceed.\n\n   Wait, perhaps not. Maybe I'm mixing up the group indices.\n\n   Alternatively, for each phase i, the group is determined by the index in the previous phase's winners divided by 2.\n\n   So, perhaps for each phase, the group is the index in phase i-1's winners divided by 2.\n\n   So, the steps for phase i:\n\n   1. Find x's index in phase i-1's winners.\n\n   2. Compute group = index // 2.\n\n   3. The opponent is the other winner in this group.\n\n   So, for x, to find the opponent in phase i, we need to find the other winner in the group.\n\n   So, for phase i, the group is group = (x's index in phase i-1) // 2.\n\n   The other member is the winner in phase i-1 at position 2*group + 1.\n\n   So, for x, to find the opponent in phase i:\n\n   - Find x's index in phase i-1's winners.\n\n   - Compute group = index // 2.\n\n   - The opponent's index in phase i-1 is 2*group + 1.\n\n   - The opponent is the team at that index.\n\n   So, the process is:\n\n   For each phase i, starting from 0:\n\n      if i ==0:\n\n          opponent = x_initial_opponent.\n\n      else:\n\n          index_prev = x's index in phase i-1's winners.\n\n          group = index_prev // 2.\n\n          opponent_prev_index = 2 * group +1.\n\n          opponent = the team at phase i-1's winners[opponent_prev_index]\n\n      Determine if x can beat opponent in phase i, based on s[i].\n\n      If not, x is not a winner.\n\n   So, the key is to compute, for each phase i, the opponent of x in phase i, which depends on the previous phase's index.\n\n   So, for each x, we can simulate this:\n\n   We can keep track of the index of x in each phase's winners.\n\n   For phase 0, x's initial index is (x-1)//2.\n\n   For phase 1, x's index is (phase0_index) // 2.\n\n   Wait, perhaps not. Let me think:\n\n   phase0 has 2^{n-1} winners, ordered as 0,1,2,...,2^{n-1}-1.\n\n   For x, phase0_index = (x-1)//2.\n\n   Then, phase1 has 2^{n-2} groups, each consisting of two consecutive phase0 winners.\n\n   So, phase1's group for x is phase0_index // 2.\n\n   So, for phase1, the group is phase0_index // 2.\n\n   The opponent in phase1 is the other member of that group, which is the phase0 winner at index 2 * group + 1.\n\n   So, for phase1, opponent_prev_index = 2 * group + 1.\n\n   So, opponent is the team at phase0_winner[opponent_prev_index].\n\n   Then, phase2's group is phase1's group // 2.\n\n   And so on.\n\n   So, the process can be modeled as:\n\n   For each x, track the current index in the previous phase.\n\n   For each phase i from 0 to n-1:\n\n      if i ==0:\n\n          opponent = x_initial_opponent.\n\n      else:\n\n          group = (current_index) // 2.\n\n          opponent_prev_index = 2*group +1.\n\n          opponent = phase[i-1][opponent_prev_index]\n\n      check if x can win against opponent in phase i.\n\n      if not, x is not a winner.\n\n      current_index = group.\n\n   So, the key is to compute for each phase i, the opponent of x.\n\n   Now, the question is, how to compute the opponent for each phase without knowing the exact permutation p.\n\n   Because p is a permutation, but for x to be the champion, p must be arranged such that all the matches along x's path are satisfied.\n\n   So, for each phase i, the opponent in phase i is determined by the structure of the bracket, but the actual team is determined by the permutation p.\n\n   Wait, but since p is a permutation, for x to be the champion, in each phase i, x must be paired with a specific team that is determined by the bracket structure, but the actual team is determined by the permutation.\n\n   So, for phase i, x's opponent is determined by the bracket structure, but the value of that opponent depends on the permutation p.\n\n   Therefore, for x to be a possible champion, there must exist a permutation p such that:\n\n   - For each phase i, x can defeat the opponent in phase i's match, according to s[i].\n\n   So, the way to model this is to find, for each phase i, the required condition on the opponent's value.\n\n   For example, in phase i, if s[i] is '1', x must be greater than the opponent.\n\n   If s[i] is '0', x must be less than the opponent.\n\n   So, for each phase i, the condition is:\n\n   if s[i] == '1':\n\n       x > opponent_i\n\n   else:\n\n       x < opponent_i\n\n   So, for x to be a champion, all these conditions must be met for some permutation p.\n\n   So, the problem reduces to finding all x such that there exists a permutation p where, for each phase i, the condition above is satisfied.\n\n   Now, the question is: how to find such x.\n\n   The key insight is that for each phase, the opponent is determined by the bracket structure, but the exact value of the opponent can be chosen as any other team that satisfies the condition.\n\n   So, for each phase i, the opponent is a team y, and y must be such that y != x, and either y < x (if s[i] is '0') or y > x (if s[i] is '1').\n\n   Moreover, in the permutation p, y must be placed in the position that makes x's path through the bracket possible.\n\n   So, the problem becomes finding x such that, for each phase i, there exists a y_i (opponent in phase i) such that y_i satisfies the condition, and the y_i's form a valid permutation.\n\n   So, the approach is to model the required constraints for each phase and see if x can satisfy all of them.\n\n   So, for each x, we can model the constraints for each phase i:\n\n   For phase i, x must be compared to some y_i, and the condition is as per s[i].\n\n   So, the process is:\n\n   For x, go through each phase i, and for each i, determine the possible y_i that x can defeat according to s[i], and then see if all y_i's can coexist in the permutation.\n\n   But how to model the y_i's.\n\n   Wait, perhaps each phase i imposes a constraint on the relative ordering of x and y_i.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which teams can win a playoff tournament given specific rules for each phase of the tournament. The tournament structure is a single-elimination bracket where each match's outcome depends on a given string `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament is structured as a binary tree where each node represents a match. The leaves are the initial teams, and each internal node represents a match between two winners from the previous round.\n2. **Phase Rules**: Each phase `i` (from 0 to n-1) has a rule specified by `s[i]`. If `s[i]` is '0', the lower-skilled team wins; if '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n3. **Path Determination**: For each team `x`, we simulate its path through the tournament bracket. For each phase, we determine if `x` can win against its opponent based on the current phase's rule.\n4. **Opponent Calculation**: In each phase, the opponent is determined by the bracket structure. For phase `i`, the opponent is the other team in the same subgroup from the previous phase.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    max_team = 1 << n\n    winning = []\n\n    for x in range(1, max_team + 1):\n        possible = True\n        current_index = (x - 1) // 2  # Phase 0 index\n        for i in range(n):\n            if i == 0:\n                if x % 2 == 1:\n                    opponent = x + 1\n                else:\n                    opponent = x - 1\n            else:\n                group = current_index // 2\n                opponent_prev_index = 2 * group + 1\n                opponent = (1 << (n - i - 1)) + opponent_prev_index\n\n            if s[i] == '1':\n                if x <= opponent:\n                    possible = False\n                    break\n            else:\n                if x >= opponent:\n                    possible = False\n                    break\n\n            current_index = group\n        if possible:\n            winning.append(x)\n\n    print('\\n'.join(map(lambda x: ' '.join(map(str, x)), winning)))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Read the input values for `n` and the string `s`.\n2. **Iterate Over Teams**: For each team `x` from 1 to `2^n`, check if it can win the tournament.\n3. **Phase Simulation**: For each phase `i`, determine the opponent based on the bracket structure and the current phase's rule.\n4. **Check Conditions**: For each phase, ensure that `x` can win against its opponent according to the rule specified by `s[i]`.\n5. **Collect Results**: If `x` can win all phases, add it to the list of winning integers.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates each team's path through the tournament bracket, ensuring that all necessary conditions are met for each phase.
