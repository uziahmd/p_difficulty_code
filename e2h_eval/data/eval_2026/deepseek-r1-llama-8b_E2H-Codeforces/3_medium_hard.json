Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street.

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Vanya is walking along a street lit by lanterns, and I have to find the minimal radius d such that all points on the street are covered. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each lantern lights a segment of the street from (ai - d) to (ai + d), but considering the boundaries. So for each lantern, the coverage starts at max(0, ai -d) and ends at min(l, ai +d). The goal is to choose d as small as possible so that the union of all these intervals covers the entire [0, l] interval.\n\nHmm, so how do I model this? Maybe it's similar to interval covering problems. But since d is the same for all lanterns, I need to find the minimal d where all the street is covered.\n\nFirst, let me think about the constraints. The street is a straight line from 0 to l. Each lantern i has a position ai. For a given d, each lantern covers [ai-d, ai+d], clamped to 0 and l. The union of all these must cover [0, l].\n\nSo the minimal d is the smallest value where this condition holds.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nAn initial thought is to binary search on d. Because as d increases, the coverage can only increase. So the function that checks if a certain d is sufficient is monotonic. That means binary search is feasible.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the plan is:\n\n1. Binary search for the minimal d.\n2. For each candidate d, check if the union of all lanterns' coverage covers [0, l].\n3. If it does, try a smaller d. Otherwise, try a larger d.\n\nBut wait, the minimal d could be determined by specific points where the coverage just touches. For example, maybe two lanterns are spaced apart in such a way that their combined coverage without any overlap requires a certain d.\n\nSo, how to implement step 2: checking whether a given d is sufficient.\n\nLet's think about the process. For each lantern, compute the left and right ends of its coverage. Then, we need to see if all the gaps between these intervals are covered.\n\nWait, perhaps the best approach is to merge all the intervals first and see if the merged coverage includes [0, l]. But merging intervals for each d might be computationally expensive if done naively, especially since n can be up to 1000 and l up to 1e9.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to sort the lanterns and then compute the maximum distance between consecutive lanterns, considering their coverage. Wait, but since d is fixed, the coverage isn't fixed; it depends on d.\n\nHmm, maybe not. So for a given d, each lantern i contributes a range [a_i -d, a_i +d], but bounded by 0 and l. We need to find if the union of all these ranges covers [0, l].\n\nTo check this, perhaps the best way is to:\n\n- Sort all the a_i.\n- For each a_i, determine the left and right coverage.\n- Then, walk through the sorted a_i and see if the coverage extends from 0 to l without any gaps.\n\nWait, but when you have multiple lanterns, their individual coverage can overlap in various ways. So perhaps the correct way is to compute the total coverage by each lantern, and then check if the union spans [0, l].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's more efficient to model the coverage as a set of intervals and then compute the union. But with n=1000, that's manageable.\n\nSo here's an idea:\n\nFor a given d, create for each lantern i the interval [max(0, a_i -d), min(l, a_i +d)]. Then, collect all these intervals, and compute their union. Check if this union includes [0, l].\n\nSo, how to compute the union? Well, you can sort all the intervals by their start points. Then, merge overlapping or adjacent intervals.\n\nOnce merged, check if the merged list starts at 0 and ends at l.\n\nSo, for each d in the binary search:\n\n1. Generate all intervals as [max(0, a_i -d), min(l, a_i +d)].\n2. Sort these intervals based on their start point.\n3. Merge overlapping or touching intervals.\n4. Check if the merged intervals cover 0 to l.\n\nIf yes, then d is feasible, and we can try to find a smaller d. Otherwise, we need to increase d.\n\nNow, the key is implementing this efficiently.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Read n and l.\n- Read the array a of size n.\n- Sort a (maybe, but not necessary for the algorithm).\n- Perform binary search on d. The lower bound can be 0, upper bound can be l (since if d is l, all points are covered).\n\nWait, but what's the maximum possible d needed? It's possible that the farthest two lanterns are at the ends, like 0 and l, so the required d would be (l)/2. But to be safe, setting the upper bound as l is acceptable.\n\nNow, the binary search steps:\n\nInitialize low = 0, high = l.\n\nFor a certain number of iterations (like 100 times), do:\n\n   mid = (low + high) / 2\n   check if mid is feasible (i.e., if all points are covered)\n   if yes, set high = mid\n   else, set low = mid\n\nAfter the loop, the minimal d is approximately found.\n\nBut wait, because of floating point precision issues, perhaps we need to run enough iterations to get a precise enough result.\n\nNow, the crux is the feasibility check.\n\nImplementing the feasibility check:\n\nGiven d, for each a_i, compute s_i = max(0, a_i -d) and e_i = min(l, a_i +d). Collect all these intervals.\n\nThen, sort them by s_i.\n\nMerge overlapping intervals:\n\nInitialize a list merged. Take the first interval as current. For each next interval, if its start <= current end, merge them into a new current (current end is max(current end, next end)). Otherwise, add current to merged and take next as current.\n\nAfter processing all intervals, check if the merged list covers 0 to l.\n\nWait, no. Because the merged list may consist of multiple intervals, but the first interval's start must be <= 0 and the last's end >= l. Wait, no, because each interval is already [max(0, ...), ...], so the first interval starts at 0 or later, and the last ends at l or before.\n\nWait, no. Because for each interval, s_i is the maximum of 0 and a_i -d, so s_i >= 0. Similarly, e_i <= l.\n\nSo the merged intervals will all be within [0, l], but their union must cover [0, l].\n\nSo after merging, the merged intervals should include 0 and l.\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose the merged intervals are [0,5] and [7, l], then l must be >=7. So the union would not cover [5,7], which is the gap. So in that case, the feasibility is false.\n\nThus, to check if the union covers [0, l], after merging, the merged intervals must form a single interval [0, l], or the union must include 0 and l with no gaps.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to track the maximum end and the minimum start.\n\nWait, here's another way to think about it:\n\nThe union of the intervals must cover the entire [0, l]. So, the earliest end of any interval must be >=0, and the latest start must be <= l. But that's not sufficient.\n\nWait, no. For example, if all intervals are [0, l], then it's fine. If some intervals are [0, x], and others are [y, l], but x < y, then the union doesn't cover. So, in that case, the union would miss [x, y].\n\nSo, how to ensure that the union covers 0 to l?\n\nWe can do the following:\n\n- Find the minimal s and maximal e across all intervals.\n\nBut that's not sufficient either. For example, all intervals could have s=0 and e= some x < l, then the union wouldn't reach l.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to track the maximum of all the starts and the minimum of all the ends, but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, no. Let me think differently.\n\nAfter generating all the intervals, the union will form a set of non-overlapping intervals. The union covers [0, l] if and only if:\n\n- The first interval's start is 0.\n- The last interval's end is l.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct because the intervals could have overlapping regions but still not cover the entire [0, l]. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nNo, wait: the intervals are [s_i, e_i], and the union of these must include every point from 0 to l.\n\nAnother approach: the union is the set of all points that are covered by at least one interval. So, to check if 0 is in the union, we need that at least one interval covers 0. Similarly, for l.\n\nBut also, for every point x in [0, l], there must be some interval that covers x.\n\nWait, but checking for all points is impossible computationally, so we need an efficient way.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- After sorting the intervals by their starting points, we can merge them into a list of non-overlapping, increasing intervals.\n\n- Then, check if the first interval starts at 0, and the last ends at l.\n\nBecause if the first interval starts at 0, and the last ends at l, then all points in between are covered.\n\nWait, that's a good point.\n\nFor example, suppose the merged intervals are [0, 5], [7, 10], and l=10. Then, the union doesn't cover 5 to 7, so the check would fail. But according to the above logic, the first interval starts at 0 and the last ends at 10, so it would incorrectly report success.\n\nAh, right. So the approach of checking if the first interval starts at 0 and the last ends at l is insufficient.\n\nSo, that suggests that the correct way is to perform interval merging and then check if the merged intervals form a single continuous interval from 0 to l.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternative approach: after merging, if the first interval's start is 0, and the last interval's end is l, then the entire street is covered.\n\nBecause the merged intervals are sorted, so if the first starts at 0, and the last ends at l, then all points in between are covered.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nFor example, if the merged list is [[0,5], [7,10]], then first starts at 0, last ends at 10, but there's a gap between 5 and7. So, the code would incorrectly think that it's covered. So, the approach of checking the first and last is wrong.\n\nWait, no. Because in that case, the merged intervals would not include the gap, so the first interval starts at 0, the last ends at 10, but the merged list is [0-5,7-10], meaning that the middle is not covered. Thus, the code would incorrectly say that the entire street is covered.\n\nSo, that approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so how to correctly check if the union covers [0, l]?\n\nIdea: after merging the intervals, the first interval's start must be 0, and the last interval's end must be l, and all the intervals must be contiguous.\n\nBut how to check that.\n\nAlternatively, after merging, we can check whether the first interval starts at 0, and the last interval ends at l, and that the merged list is a single interval.\n\nWait, no. Because the merged list may consist of multiple intervals, but their union is [0, l].\n\nWait, perhaps the correct condition is that the first interval's start is 0, and the last interval's end is l, and the total merged coverage is such that the maximum end of all intervals is >= l and the minimum start is <=0.\n\nBut again, that's not sufficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to check whether the union of all intervals includes 0 and l, and that the maximum of the left ends is >= the minimum of the right ends.\n\nNo, that's not clear.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nCompute all the intervals, sort them by start, merge them, and then check if the first interval starts at 0 and the last ends at l. Also, make sure that the merged list is a single interval, but that's not necessarily the case because the intervals could be in separate parts.\n\nWait, no. Because if the intervals are [0,5], [7,10], and l=10, then the merged list is two intervals, but the union doesn't cover [5,7], so the street isn't fully lit.\n\nSo, the condition is that the merged intervals form a single continuous interval starting at 0 and ending at l.\n\nWait, no. Because if there are multiple merged intervals, but they all together span from 0 to l with no gaps.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct condition is that the earliest end among all intervals is >=0, the latest start is <=l, and the maximum end is >=l, and the minimum start is <=0.\n\nBut that seems too vague.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nAfter generating all the intervals, the union will cover [0, l] if and only if the maximum of all the s_i (start points) is <= the minimum of all the e_i (end points). But that's not correct because s_i is the start of each interval, and e_i is the end.\n\nWait, no. For example, if all intervals have s_i <= e_i, but their union doesn't cover [0, l].\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should model the problem differently. Instead of thinking about the intervals, think about the street being covered by the lanterns.\n\nEach lantern's coverage is a circle of radius d around its position. So, the entire street is covered if every point on [0, l] is within at least one circle.\n\nSo, the minimal d is the smallest value such that the union of all circles covers [0, l].\n\nThis is equivalent to saying that the entire [0, l] is contained within the union of the circles.\n\nSo, how can I model this?\n\nOne approach is to consider the street as a line from 0 to l, and for each point x in this line, find the minimal d such that x is covered by at least one lantern's circle.\n\nBut since x varies, the minimal d that satisfies for all x is the maximum of the minimal d required for each x.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because for each x, the minimal d needed for x to be covered is the distance to the nearest lantern.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because other lanterns may cover x with a larger d.\n\nWait, no. For a given x, the minimal d needed for x to be covered is the minimal distance from x to any lantern. Because if that lantern is within d, x is covered.\n\nWait, no. For x, it's covered if there exists a lantern a_i such that |x - a_i| <=d.\n\nSo, the minimal d needed to cover x is the minimal distance from x to any a_i.\n\nWait, but the overall minimal d is the maximum of these minimal distances over all x in [0, l]. Because for all x, their required d must be <= the global d.\n\nSo, the minimal d is the maximum of the minimal required d for each x.\n\nWait, that's a crucial insight. So, for each point x on the street, compute the minimal distance to any lantern. The minimal d must be at least as large as the maximum of these minimal distances.\n\nBecause if d is less than that maximum, then there exists some x where no lantern is within d distance, hence x is not covered.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the maximum of the minimal distances from any x in [0, l] to the closest lantern.\n\nSo, the minimal d is equal to the maximum of the minimal required d for each x.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the minimal d is the maximum of the minimal distances from any point x to the nearest lantern.\n\nSo, the problem becomes: find the maximum of the minimal distances between any point on [0, l] and the set of lanterns.\n\nThis is known as the covering radius problem for a set of points on a line.\n\nSo, how to compute this?\n\nThe minimal required d is the maximum of the minimal distances from any point on the line segment [0, l] to the nearest lantern.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. For each lantern, mark the points on the street that it covers for the current d.\n2. The minimal d is the smallest value such that the entire street is covered.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nWell, since the minimal d is the maximum of the minimal distances for each point, we can model this as finding the point x where the distance to the nearest lantern is the largest.\n\nSo, the minimal d is the maximum of the minimal distances.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the maximum of the minimal distances from x to any lantern, for x in [0, l].\n\nThis maximum is the minimal d required.\n\nSo, now, the problem is transformed into finding this maximum.\n\nHow can I compute this efficiently?\n\nI remember that the maximum of the minimal distances occurs either at a point where two lanterns are equally distant, or at one of the endpoints.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum is either at a point where three lanterns meet (the median in some way), or at the ends.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum occurs at one of the critical points where the nearest lantern changes.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n- Sort the lantern positions.\n- For each possible interval between two consecutive lanterns (including 0 and l), compute the maximum minimal distance in that interval.\n- The overall maximum is the maximum of all these.\n\nSo, for example, consider the sorted lanterns a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.\n\nThe intervals are:\n\n- From 0 to a_1.\n- Between a_1 and a_2.\n- ...\n- Between a_{n-1} and a_n.\n- From a_n to l.\n\nIn each interval, the minimal distance for any point x is the distance to the nearest lantern. So, for a point x in [a_i, a_{i+1}], the nearest lantern is a_i or a_{i+1}, whichever is closer.\n\nSo, the minimal distance is the distance to the closer end.\n\nSo, the maximum in each interval is either at the midpoint (if the distance is equal on both sides) or at one of the endpoints.\n\nWait, no. For the interval [a, b], the minimal distance for any x in [a, b] is min(x - a, b -x). The maximum of this function occurs at x = (a + b)/2, and the value is (b - a)/2.\n\nWait, that's correct. Because the function min(x -a, b -x) reaches its maximum at the midpoint, with value (b -a)/2.\n\nSo, for each interval between a_i and a_{i+1}, the maximum minimal distance is (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2.\n\nAdditionally, we have to consider the endpoints of the street: 0 and l.\n\nFor x=0, the minimal distance is a_1, assuming a_1 is the first lantern. Similarly, for x=l, it's a_n.\n\nSo, the maximum minimal distance is the maximum of:\n\n- (a_1)/2 (the distance from 0 to a_1)\n- (l - a_n)/2 (distance from a_n to l)\n- the maximum of (a_{i+1} -a_i)/2 for all consecutive pairs.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because for the interval between a_i and a_{i+1}, the maximum minimal distance is (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2. So the maximum across all such intervals is the maximum of these values.\n\nAlso, the endpoints 0 and l contribute their own minimal distances, which are a_1 and (l - a_n), respectively.\n\nSo, the overall maximum d is the maximum between:\n\n- a_1 (distance from 0 to first lantern)\n- (l - a_n) (distance from last lantern to l)\n- the maximum of (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2 for all i from 1 to n-1.\n\nWait, but that's only if the lanterns are sorted. So, the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the array a.\n\n2. Compute the initial maximum as the maximum of a[0] and (l - a[-1]).\n\n3. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute (next - current)/2 and see if it's larger than the current maximum.\n\n4. The overall maximum is the largest of these.\n\nBut wait, what if there are zero or one lantern?\n\nIf n=0, but according to the input constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nWait, no. The problem statement says 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000.\n\nSo, for n=1, the lantern is at a_1. Then the minimal d is the maximum of a_1 (distance from 0 to a_1) and (l - a_1) (distance from a_1 to l). So the minimal d is the maximum of these two.\n\nWhich makes sense, because the lantern's coverage must reach both ends.\n\nSo, this approach works for all cases.\n\nWait, but let's test it against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nWait, the second sample's input is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nSo, n=2, l=5.\n\nSorted a is [2,5].\n\nCompute the initial maximum: a[0]=2, l - a[1] =0. Max is 2.\n\nThen, compute the difference between 5 and 2: 3. Half is 1.5. So maximum is max(2, 1.5) = 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output of 2.0000000000.\n\nAnother test case: the first sample.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nWait, the sorted a is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nCompute initial max: a[0] =0, l - a[-1] =15-15=0. So initial max is 0.\n\nThen, for each consecutive pair:\n\n3-0=3 → 1.5\n\n5-3=2 →1\n\n7-5=2→1\n\n9-7=2→1\n\n14-9=5 →2.5\n\n15-14=1→0.5.\n\nSo the maximum among these is 2.5.\n\nSo the overall max is max(0, 2.5) =2.5, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, a=[0], l=10.\n\nThen, initial max is 0 and 10-0=10. So overall max is 10.\n\nSo, the lantern is at 0, and to cover l=10, d must be 10.\n\nWhich is correct because the coverage is [0,10], which is exactly the street.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, a=[0,10], l=10.\n\nInitial max is a[0]=0 and l - a[1]=0. The differences are 10, so half is 5. So the maximum is 5.\n\nWhich makes sense, as the midpoint is 5 away from both lanterns, so d=5 covers everything.\n\nSo, this approach seems solid.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n- Sort the array a.\n\n- Compute the initial maximum as the maximum of a[0] and (l - a[-1]).\n\n- For each consecutive pair in the sorted a, compute (next - current)/2. Keep track of the maximum of these.\n\n- The overall d is the maximum between the initial maximum and the maximum computed in step 3.\n\nSo, the steps are clear.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the array a.\n\nSort a.\n\nCompute initial_max = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\nCompute the max_gap = 0.\n\nFor i from 0 to n-2:\n\n   diff = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n   current_gap = diff / 2\n\n   if current_gap > max_gap:\n\n       max_gap = current_gap\n\nCompute overall_max = max(initial_max, max_gap)\n\nPrint overall_max with 10 decimal places.\n\nWait, but wait! What if n=1?\n\nIn that case, a has only one element. So, the initial_max is max(a[0], l - a[0]). And since there are no consecutive pairs, the max_gap is 0. So the overall_max is the initial_max, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, a = [1,4,6], l=7.\n\nsorted a: [1,4,6]\n\ninitial_max: max(1, 7-6=1) → 1.\n\nmax_gap: between 1 and4: 3/2=1.5; between4 and6: 1. So max_gap is1.5.\n\noverall_max is max(1, 1.5) → 1.5.\n\nWhich makes sense, because the midpoint between 1 and4 is 2.5, which is 1.5 away from both.\n\nSo, the algorithm seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nRead n, l.\n\nRead the list of a.\n\nSort a.\n\nCompute initial_max.\n\nCompute max_gap.\n\nSet d as the maximum of initial_max and max_gap.\n\nPrint d with 10 decimal places.\n\nSo, the code is straightforward.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n7 15\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0 → sorted is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\ninitial_max is max(0,15-15)=0.\n\nmax_gap is max of (3-0)/2=1.5, (5-3)/2=1, etc. The maximum is (14-9)/2=2.5.\n\nSo d=2.5 → output 2.5000000000.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, l=5.\n\na=[2,5] sorted.\n\ninitial_max is max(2, 0) =2.\n\nmax_gap is (5-2)/2=1.5.\n\nso d=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=1, a=[0], l=10.\n\nd is 10.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2, a=[0,10], l=10.\n\nd is 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nWait, but the input is given as a string, like '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', etc.\n\nWait, the code needs to read the first line as n and l, and the second line as the list of a.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\na.sort()\n\ninitial_max = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\nmax_gap = 0\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    diff = a[i+1] - a[i]\n    current_gap = diff / 2\n    if current_gap > max_gap:\n        max_gap = current_gap\n\nd = max(initial_max, max_gap)\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nWait, but wait: for the initial_max, when a[0] is zero, and l - a[-1] is l - a[-1]. For example, if a[-1] is l, then l - a[-1] is zero.\n\nSo, the code correctly handles all cases.\n\nTesting with n=1: a has length 1, so a[0] is the only element.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nWhat about when a has multiple elements, including the same position.\n\nFor example, n=3, a = [0,0,0], l=5.\n\ninitial_max is 0.\n\nmax_gap is 0.\n\nd is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, a=[0,3,5], l=10.\n\nsorted a: [0,3,5]\n\ninitial_max: max(0, 10-5=5) →5.\n\nmax_gap: (3-0)/2=1.5; (5-3)/2=1 →max_gap is 1.5.\n\nd is 5.\n\nWhich makes sense because the coverage from the last lantern is up to 5+5=10, but the first lantern covers up to 0+5=5, leaving 5-10 as covered by the last lantern. Wait, but the initial_max is 5, which is larger than max_gap.\n\nSo, the minimal d is 5.\n\nWait, but if d is 5, then the last lantern covers up to 5+5=10, which is correct. The first lantern covers 0 to 5.\n\nWait, but the initial_max is 5, which is correct because the distance from 0 to the first lantern is 0, but the distance from the last lantern to l is 5.\n\nSo, the code correctly outputs 5.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, a=[1,4,6], l=7.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the code correctly computes d=1.5.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all points on a street of length \\( l \\) are lit by \\( n \\) lanterns located at given positions. Each lantern lights a segment of the street within a distance \\( d \\) from its position.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to find the maximum of the minimal distances from any point on the street to the nearest lantern. This value will be our required minimum radius \\( d \\).\n\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the calculation of distances between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Initial Maximum Distance**: Calculate the maximum distance from the start (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end (l).\n3. **Gaps Between Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the maximum gap divided by 2. This gives the radius needed to cover the midpoint between two consecutive lanterns.\n4. **Determine Minimum Radius**: The overall minimum radius \\( d \\) is the maximum value between the initial maximum distance and the largest gap calculated.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n    \n    initial_max = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n    max_gap = 0.0\n    \n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        diff = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        current_gap = diff / 2\n        if current_gap > max_gap:\n            max_gap = current_gap\n    \n    d = max(initial_max, max_gap)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of lanterns \\( n \\) and the length of the street \\( l \\), followed by the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Initial Maximum Calculation**: The maximum distance from the start to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street is computed.\n4. **Gap Calculation**: For each consecutive pair of lanterns, the gap between them is calculated and halved. The maximum of these values is tracked.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The minimum radius \\( d \\) is determined as the maximum value between the initial maximum distance and the largest gap.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum radius \\( d \\) required to cover the entire street, considering both the endpoints and the gaps between lanterns.",
