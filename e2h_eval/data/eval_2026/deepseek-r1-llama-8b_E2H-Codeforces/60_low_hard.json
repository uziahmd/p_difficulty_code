Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the number of valid Morse code substrings after each step of building a string S. Hmm, let's try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that each Morse code letter is represented by a string of 1-4 characters, consisting of 0s and 1s. But not all possible combinations are valid. There are four invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So any substring in S that corresponds exactly to one of these four shouldn't be counted as a valid English letter.\n\nWait, but the problem isn't just about counting valid letters. It's about counting all possible non-empty substrings that represent some valid letter. So for each position in S, I need to look at all possible substrings starting or ending there and check if they form a valid Morse code.\n\nBut considering that m can be up to 3000, a naive approach of checking every possible substring each time would be way too slow. So I need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Maybe I can keep track of the number of valid substrings ending at each position.\n\nYes! For each character added, I can update a DP array where dp[i] represents the number of valid substrings ending at position i.\n\nHow to compute dp[i]? Well, for each new character, I look back at the previous few positions (up to 3 steps back) because Morse codes are up to 4 digits long. For each possible length l (from 1 to 4), I check if the substring ending at i with length l is valid.\n\nWait, but how do I efficiently check whether a substring is valid? Because for each possible l, I have to consider all possible substrings of length l ending at i and check if they're in the set of invalid strings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe precompute all the invalid strings and store them in a set. Then, when a new character is added, I look at the last 1,2,3,4 characters to form possible substrings and see if any of them are invalid. But wait, no—because the count is based on the number of valid substrings, not invalid ones. So perhaps we can model this differently.\n\nWait, another approach: for each new character, the number of new valid substrings added is equal to the number of valid substrings that end at this character. So for each position i, we look back at the previous 3 positions (since the maximum length is 4). For each j from i-1 down to max(0, i-3), we check if the substring s[j..i] is valid. If yes, then add 1 to the total.\n\nBut even this could be O(m*4) which is manageable since m is 3000, so 12000 operations. That should be acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute all valid Morse code strings (all except the four invalid ones).\n- Maintain a variable 'total' that keeps track of the cumulative count of valid substrings.\n- For each new character added to S, look at the last 1, 2, 3, 4 characters (if available) and for each possible length l (from 1 to 4), check if the substring is valid.\n- For each valid substring found, add 1 to the 'total'.\n- Output 'total' modulo 1e9+7 after each step.\n\nBut wait, how to handle the substrings of varying lengths efficiently?\n\nLet me think of it this way: for each new character c added at position i, I will check all possible substrings ending at i with lengths 1, 2, 3, 4. So for each possible l in 1 to 4, I take the substring s[i-l+1 ... i], and check if it's a valid Morse code.\n\nIf it is, then the number of valid substrings increases by 1.\n\nSo, for each step i, I can loop l from 1 to 4, and for each l, if i >= l-1, check the substring s[i-l+1 ... i]. If it's valid, add 1 to the total.\n\nBut how to represent the substrings? Since S is built incrementally, I can just keep the last 3 characters, because each new character can only form a substring of up to 4 with the previous ones.\n\nWait, but for each new character, I can keep track of the last 3 characters, because any substring longer than 4 would have been considered before.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: for a new character at position i, the possible substrings ending at i are those of length 1, 2, 3, 4. So for each l in 1 to 4, I need to look at the substring formed by the last l characters, including the current one.\n\nSo for each",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of valid Morse code substrings after each modification to a string S. Each modification appends either a dot ('0') or a dash ('1') to S. A valid Morse code substring corresponds to a unique English letter, excluding four specific invalid strings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Valid Morse Codes**: Identify all valid Morse code strings (length 1 to 4) that correspond to English letters, excluding the four invalid strings.\n2. **Dynamic Programming**: Use a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the number of valid substrings ending at each position in S. For each new character added, check the last 1 to 4 characters to form possible substrings and count those that are valid.\n3. **Efficient Checking**: For each new character, check substrings of length 1 to 4 ending at that character. If a substring is valid, increment the total count of valid substrings.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n# Precompute all valid Morse codes except the four invalid ones\nvalid_codes = set()\nfor length in range(1, 5):\n    for bits in itertools.product('01', repeat=length):\n        code = ''.join(bits)\n        if code not in ['0011', '0101', '1110', '1111']:\n            valid_codes.add(code)\n\nm = int(input())\nS = []\ntotal = 0\nfor _ in range(m):\n    c = input().strip()\n    S.append(c)\n    # Check all possible substrings ending at current position with lengths 1-4\n    current_total = 0\n    for l in range(1, 5):\n        start = max(0, len(S) - l)\n        substr = ''.join(S[start: len(S)])\n        if substr in valid_codes:\n            current_total += 1\n    total += current_total\n    print(total % MOD)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precomputation**: We first generate all possible Morse code strings of lengths 1 to 4 and exclude the four invalid strings. This helps in efficiently checking the validity of substrings later.\n2. **Dynamic Programming**: For each new character added to S, we consider all possible substrings ending at this character with lengths 1 to 4. Using the precomputed valid codes, we check each substring's validity.\n3. **Efficiency**: By only checking the last 4 characters at each step, we ensure the solution runs efficiently even for the maximum input size.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count valid Morse code substrings after each modification to S, providing the required results modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).",
