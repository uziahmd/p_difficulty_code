For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine whether a given triad is major, minor, or strange. Hmm, let's break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the problem statement says that a major triad has notes X, Y, Z such that when ordered correctly, the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones and Y to Z is 3 semitones. So the total is 7 semitones. For a minor triad, it's the opposite: X to Y is 3 semitones and Y to Z is 4, making a total of 7 as well. But wait, no, because 3+4 is 7, same as major. Oh right, but the order matters for each case.\n\nSo the approach is: given three notes, check all possible orderings of them to see if any of them satisfy either the major or minor condition.\n\nBut wait, the chord is unordered. So for each permutation of the three notes, we can try to arrange them in such a way that the distances fit the major or minor pattern.\n\nWait, but how do we represent the notes? Maybe assign each note a numerical value based on their position in the scale, then compute the distances between them.\n\nLet me think about the note order. The notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait—no, wait. Wait, the user provided the list as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, that seems odd because usually after H comes C again. Wait, maybe H is another note, perhaps a typo. Or maybe it's a specific notation used here. Wait, in the problem statement, it says the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then they repeat cyclically. So the order is: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nWait, so the order is 12 notes, each next is a semitone higher. So for example, C to C# is 1 semitone, C to D is 2, etc. Wait, but the problem says between two consecutive notes is exactly one semitone, which is 0.5 tone. So each step is 0.5.\n\nSo first, I need to create a list mapping each note to its index. Then, for any two notes, the distance is computed by the number of steps between them in the circular list, considering the direction.\n\nWait, but when calculating the distance from X to Y, it's the minimal path, but according to the problem statement, the distance is taken from the lower to the higher note. So for example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones (C to C# is 1, then D (2), D# (3), E (4)). So in terms of indexes, let's say C is 0, C# 1, D 2, D# 3, E 4, F 5, F#6, G7, G#8, A9, B10, H11. So E is at 4, C is 0. The distance from C to E is 4 semitones. But the distance from E to C would be 8, since you go up through F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C.\n\nSo for any two notes, the distance is calculated as (y - x) mod 12, but only if y >=x. Otherwise, it's 12 - (x - y). Wait no, because the distance is always from lower to higher. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. Because if Y is after X, then Y - X is the correct number. If X is after Y, then mod 12 gives the correct count.\n\nWait, no. Let's see: for X and Y, the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) if Y >= X, else (Y +12 - X). But using modulo 12, (Y - X) %12 gives the correct positive distance.\n\nWait, for example: X is E (4), Y is C (0). (0-4) mod12 is -4 mod12 = 8, which is correct. So the distance from E to C is 8 semitones. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) %12.\n\nSo first, I'll create a dictionary that maps each note to its index. Let's make a list:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given triad of musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The chords are defined based on the distances between their notes in a cyclic musical scale.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Note Order**: The notes are arranged cyclically as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Each consecutive note is a semitone apart.\n2. **Calculate Distances**: For any two notes X and Y, the distance from X to Y is calculated as the number of semitones between them when moving upwards in the scale. This can be determined using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n3. **Check for Major and Minor Triads**: A major triad has distances of 4 and 3 semitones between its notes in some order. A minor triad has distances of 3 and 4 semitones. We need to check all permutations of the given notes to see if they fit either pattern.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input\nnotes = input().split()\na, b, c = notes\n\n# Create a mapping from note to index\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\n# Function to compute distance from x to y (y must be higher)\ndef distance(x, y):\n    return (note_to_index[y] - note_to_index[x]) % 12\n\n# Generate all possible orderings of the three notes\nfrom itertools import permutations\nall_orders = permutations([a, b, c])\n\n# Check each permutation for major or minor\nis_major = False\nis_minor = False\n\nfor perm in all_orders:\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = distance(x, y)\n    d2 = distance(y, z)\n    total_d = (d1 + d2) % 12  # Ensure it's 7 semitones\n    \n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        is_major = True\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        is_minor = True\n\nif is_major and is_minor:\n    print(\"strange\")\nelif is_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif is_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three notes which are split into individual variables.\n2. **Note Mapping**: Each note is mapped to its corresponding index in the cyclic order of the scale.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is computed using modulo arithmetic to ensure it correctly wraps around the cyclic scale.\n4. **Permutations Check**: All permutations of the three notes are generated to check each possible ordering for fitting the major or minor chord criteria.\n5. **Determine Chord Type**: Based on the distances found, the triad is classified as major, minor, or strange.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the triad to determine its type accurately.",
