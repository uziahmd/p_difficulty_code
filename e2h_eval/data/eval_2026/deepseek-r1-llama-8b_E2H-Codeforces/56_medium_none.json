Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about assigning Rebel spaceships to guard B bases. Each base must have exactly one spaceship, and each spaceship must be assigned to exactly one base. So it's a perfect matching problem between R ships and B bases.\n\nBut there's an additional condition: the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship shouldn't intersect in 2D space. Wait, what does that mean? Oh right, the paths are straight lines from the base to the spaceship. So if any two such paths cross each other, it's not allowed.\n\nHmm, how do I model this? Well, for each possible perfect matching between the ships and bases, I need to check whether all the corresponding lines (from ships to bases) don't intersect each other.\n\nSo first, I need to generate all possible perfect matchings between R ships and B bases. Then, for each matching, I have to check if all the connecting lines are non-intersecting.\n\nWait, but R and B can be up to 10 each. So the number of possible matchings is limited. For example, when R=B=10, the number of perfect matchings is 10! which is 3,628,800. That's manageable for a brute-force approach because even 10^6 iterations are feasible for a Python solution.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read the input: R and B, then R ship coordinates, then B base coordinates.\n2. Generate all possible perfect matchings between the ships and bases. Since B can be less than R or vice versa? Wait, no. Because the problem says \"assign R rebels to B bases\" implies R = B, right? Because otherwise, it's impossible to have a perfect matching. Because the question says it's a perfect matching, meaning each is assigned exactly once. So the first line says R and B, but the way the problem is described, perhaps R and B can be different? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: \"the assignment is a perfect matching\". So R must equal B. Because a perfect matching requires the same number of elements on both sides. So the initial condition is that R equals B. But wait, the input constraints say 1 ≤ R, B ≤10. So perhaps R and B could be different, but the code needs to handle cases where R != B as impossible?\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the following B lines\" after R. So for example, if R is 3 and B is 2, then the second part can't form a matching. So in the output, it's automatically 'No'.\n\nSo the first step is to check whether R == B. If not, output 'No' immediately.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the assignment must be a perfect matching. So R must equal B. Otherwise, it's impossible. So yes, if R != B, output 'No'.\n\nSo that's the first check.\n\nSo first, if R != B, output 'No'.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nThen, for the case when R == B, we need to find a permutation of the bases such that when each base is connected to a ship, the lines don't intersect.\n\nSo how to represent the ships and bases? As points in 2D space.\n\nNow, for a given permutation of the bases (each base is assigned to a ship), we need to check if any two lines (from ship to base) intersect.\n\nWait, but how to represent the lines and check for intersections?\n\nEach line is a straight line between two points: the base and the ship. So for each pair of lines in the matching, we need to check if they intersect, except when they are the same line (but since all points are unique, according to the problem statement, that's not possible).\n\nSo for each matching, we can create a list of lines, then for every pair of lines, check if they intersect. If any pair intersects, the matching is invalid.\n\nIf all lines in the matching are non-intersecting, then the matching is valid.\n\nSo the steps for the code are:\n\n1. Read R and B. If R != B, output 'No'.\n2. Read R ship points.\n3. Read B base points.\n4. Generate all possible permutations of the bases (since each base must be matched to exactly one ship).\n   - For each permutation, assign the i-th ship to the j-th base in the permutation.\n5. For each permutation:\n   a. Create the list of lines (ship_i to base_j).\n   b. Check all pairs of these lines for intersection.\n   c. If any pair intersects, skip to the next permutation.\n   d. If none intersect, then output 'Yes'.\n6. After checking all permutations, if none satisfy the condition, output 'No'.\n\nNow, the key part is implementing the line intersection check.\n\nHow to check if two line segments intersect?\n\nTwo line segments AB and CD intersect if:\n\n- The points A, B, C, D are in such a way that the lines cross each other within the segments.\n\nAn efficient way to compute this is to use the cross product method.\n\nThe steps for two line segments (A to B) and (C to D):\n\nCompute the orientation of various points.\n\nLet me recall the algorithm:\n\nFunction ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B.x - A.x)*(C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(C.x - A.x)\n\nIf ccw(A, B, C) * ccw(A, B, D) <=0 and\nccw(C, D, A) * ccw(C, D, B) <=0:\n    then the segments intersect.\n\nBut wait, that's for the general case. Also, we need to ensure that the intersection is within the segments.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider the four points as per their positions and see if the lines cross.\n\nWait, I think the standard method is to compute whether the segments AB and CD intersect using the following steps:\n\nCheck if the points are in a certain order that implies intersection.\n\nBut let's think of a function that returns True if two line segments AB and CD intersect.\n\nImplementing this in code.\n\nSo, for two segments (a1, a2) and (b1, b2):\n\nCompute the cross product of (a2 - a1) and (b1 - a1). If this is zero, the lines are colinear, but we need to check if the segments overlap in that case.\n\nBut in our problem, the points are all unique and no three are colinear, according to the problem statement. So the case where two segments lie on the same line would require that they are actually overlapping, which is also considered as an intersection.\n\nWait, but the problem says that no three points are on the same line. So each line has exactly two points. So for two lines, either they are the same line (which is not possible here because all points are unique) or they are parallel or intersecting at a single point.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"it is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\"\n\nSo for any two distinct points, they form a unique line, and no three are on the same line. So for any two line segments, they are either:\n\n- Disjoint and non-parallel: they intersect at exactly one point.\n- Disjoint and parallel: they do not intersect.\n- Same line: but that's not possible here because all points are unique.\n\nWait, no, because two different line segments can be part of the same line, but since no three points are colinear, each line has exactly two points. So two line segments cannot be on the same line unless they are the same segment.\n\nWait, no, that's not possible. Because each line can only have two points. So any two different line segments would either be on different lines or be on the same line but not overlapping (since that would imply three points on the same line, which is not allowed).\n\nWait, no, because each line is defined by exactly two points, and no three points are on the same line. So any two line segments will either be on different lines or overlapping only if they are the same line, but that's not possible here.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have two line segments AB and CD.\n\nIf AB and CD are on the same line, then since no three points are colinear, that would mean that {A, B} is a subset of {C, D}, but since all points are unique, AB and CD can't be the same line unless they are the same segment.\n\nBut since each line can't have more than two points, AB and CD must be on different lines or the same line but with overlapping segments, which is not possible because all points are unique.\n\nWait, no. Suppose AB is from (0,0) to (1,0), and CD is from (0,0) to (2,0). But according to the problem statement, no three points are on the same line, so CD can't exist because (0,0) is already connected to A and C is another point on the same line. So in the input, such a situation can't happen.\n\nTherefore, any two line segments in the problem will either be on different lines or the same line but with non-overlapping segments, which isn't possible because the points are all unique.\n\nSo for our purposes, two line segments either don't intersect, or they intersect at exactly one point, and their lines are not the same.\n\nSo the algorithm to check for line segment intersection can proceed as follows:\n\nCompute the orientation of four points A, B, C, D.\n\nThe segments AB and CD intersect if and only if:\n\n- The points C and D are on opposite sides of AB, and A and B are on opposite sides of CD.\n\nWhich can be determined using the cross product method.\n\nSo, the function to check if two segments AB and CD intersect is:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    # Compute orientation\n    def ccw(p, q, r):\n        return (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - p.x)\n    \n    ccw1 = ccw(a, b, c)\n    ccw2 = ccw(a, b, d)\n    ccw3 = ccw(c, d, a)\n    ccw4 = ccw(c, d, b)\n    \n    # General case\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n    \n    # Special cases (collinear points)\n    # Check if points are collinear and the segments overlap\n    if ccw1 == 0 and ccw2 == 0 and ccw3 == 0 and ccw4 == 0:\n        # All points are collinear. Now check if any segment is contained within the other.\n        # Since no three points are colinear, this can't happen because that would require three points on the same line.\n        # So this case won't occur.\n        return False\n    elif ccw1 == 0:\n        # c is on AB\n        # Check if d is also on AB, but that would require three points on the same line, which is not allowed.\n        # So in this case, the segments either coincide (same line) but since no three points are on the same line, this can't happen.\n        return False\n    elif ccw3 == 0:\n        # a is on CD\n        return False\n    elif ccw4 == 0:\n        # b is on CD\n        return False\n    \n    # Otherwise, no intersection\n    return False\n\nWait, but wait: in our problem, all points are unique, and no three are colinear. So the special cases where some points are on the same line as another segment can't happen. Because that would require three points on the same line.\n\nSo in the code, the only case to consider is the general case where the segments cross each other.\n\nTherefore, the function can be simplified.\n\nSo, the function can be written as:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    ccw1 = ccw(a, b, c)\n    ccw2 = ccw(a, b, d)\n    ccw3 = ccw(c, d, a)\n    ccw4 = ccw(c, d, b)\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n    return False\n\nYes, because in our case, the other special cases can't happen.\n\nSo now, for each permutation of the bases, we need to check all pairs of the connecting lines for intersection.\n\nSo for a given permutation, the lines are ship_0 to base_perm[0], ship_1 to base_perm[1], etc.\n\nFor each i < j, we take the line from ship_i to base_perm[i], and the line from ship_j to base_perm[j]. We check if these two lines intersect.\n\nWait, no. Because the lines are between ship and base, but the order is important. For example, if you have two lines L1 (ship A to base B) and L2 (ship C to base D), their order in the permutation doesn't matter; you just need to check if L1 and L2 intersect.\n\nSo for each permutation, we collect all the lines (ship_i, base_i for i in 0..R-1). Then, for all pairs of lines in this collection, we check if they intersect.\n\nIf any pair does, the permutation is invalid.\n\nSo for a permutation, to be valid, all pairs of lines must not intersect.\n\nWait, no. Because the lines are between ships and bases, but the permutation defines which ship is assigned to which base. So in the permutation, each line is from a ship to a base.\n\nThus, for the entire permutation, any two lines (ship_i to base_i, ship_j to base_j) must not intersect.\n\nSo for each permutation, we need to compare every pair of lines in the set of lines derived from that permutation.\n\nSo for example, if the permutation is [base1, base2, base3], then the lines are ship1-base1, ship2-base2, ship3-base3. We need to check all possible pairs among these lines.\n\nWait, no. Because each line is between a ship and a base. So, for any two lines in the permutation, they could potentially intersect. So for all i < j, lines i and j may intersect.\n\nSo, for the permutation, collect all lines, and for every pair of lines, check if they intersect.\n\nIf any pair does, the permutation is invalid.\n\nSo for each permutation, the process is:\n\nlines = [ (ship_0, base_perm[0]), (ship_1, base_perm[1]), ..., (ship_{R-1}, base_perm[R-1}) ]\n\nfor i in 0 to len(lines)-1:\n    for j in i+1 to len(lines)-1:\n        if segments_intersect( lines[i][0], lines[i][1], lines[j][0], lines[j][1] ):\n            permutation is invalid.\n\nSo, for a given permutation, how many pairs do we need to check?\n\nFor n lines, it's n*(n-1)/2 pairs.\n\nIn the worst case, for R=10, it's 45 checks per permutation.\n\nWhich is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is solid.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nFirst, read R and B.\n\nIf R != B, output No.\n\nElse, read R ship points.\n\nRead B base points.\n\nGenerate all possible permutations of the bases (since each base must be assigned to exactly one ship).\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   create a list of tuples, each tuple is (ship_i, base_j), where j is the position in the permutation.\n\n   for all i < j in this list:\n\n       get two lines: line_i (ship_i to base_j) and line_j (ship_j to base_k)\n\n       check if they intersect.\n\n       if any pair intersects, break and try the next permutation.\n\n   if none of the pairs intersect, output Yes.\n\nIf after all permutations, none found, output No.\n\nSo the code will look something like this.\n\nBut wait, in Python, generating all permutations of the bases can be done via itertools.permutations.\n\nBut the bases are in a list, and each permutation represents the assignment.\n\nWait, for example, if the bases are stored in a list called bases, then a permutation is a tuple where each element is an index into this list.\n\nWait no, because the permutation is an ordering of the bases. So for example, the permutation (1, 0, 2) would mean that the first ship is assigned to the base at index 1, the second to index 0, etc.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the permutation is a rearrangement of the base indices. So, for each permutation, each base is assigned to exactly one ship, in the order of the permutation.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the permutation as a list where the i-th element is the index of the base assigned to the i-th ship.\n\nFor example, if the bases are [base0, base1, base2], then a permutation (1,2,0) means ship0 is assigned to base1, ship1 to base2, ship2 to base0.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo in code:\n\nimport itertools\n\nships = [...]  # list of ship points\nbases = [...]    # list of base points\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(range(B)):\n    # perm is a tuple of length B, representing the assignment of bases to ships\n    # for ship i, base is perm[i]\n    lines = []\n    for i in range(R):\n        s = ships[i]\n        b = bases[perm[i]]\n        lines.append( (s, b) )\n    \n    # Now check all pairs of lines in lines\n    valid = True\n    for i in range(len(lines)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(lines)):\n            a, b = lines[i]\n            c, d = lines[j]\n            if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if not valid:\n            break\n    if valid:\n        print(\"Yes\")\n        exit()\nprint(\"No\")\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, the function segments_intersect needs to be implemented.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the 'segments_intersect' function takes four points: a, b, c, d.\n\nBut each line is represented by two points: a and b are the endpoints of the first line, c and d of the second.\n\nSo the function correctly checks if lines AB and CD intersect.\n\nNow, in Python, the points can be represented as tuples or objects with x and y attributes.\n\nSo for each ship and base, their coordinates are stored as tuples.\n\nSo, in the code, for each ship and base, their x and y are accessed as a.x, a.y, etc.\n\nBut in Python, tuples are accessed by index. So perhaps it's better to represent each point as a tuple of (x, y), and then extract x and y as a[0], a[1].\n\nSo the function 'ccw' will take four points: a, b, c, d.\n\nWait, no: in the function, 'ccw' is a helper function that takes three points, computes the cross product.\n\nSo, the function 'segments_intersect' is as follows.\n\nImplementing 'ccw':\n\ndef ccw(a, b, c):\n    return (b[0] - a[0]) * (c[1] - a[1]) - (b[1] - a[1]) * (c[0] - a[0])\n\nThen, segments_intersect:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    ccw1 = ccw(a, b, c)\n    ccw2 = ccw(a, b, d)\n    ccw3 = ccw(c, d, a)\n    ccw4 = ccw(c, d, b)\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n    return False\n\nWait, but what about the case where the line segments are colinear? Because in that case, the cross products would be zero, and the function would return False, which is correct because colinear segments do not cross each other (since all points are unique and no three are colinear, so two colinear segments can't be on the same line, so they are parallel and do not intersect).\n\nSo, the function is correct.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, test the example.\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nbases:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nThe sample says output is 'Yes'.\n\nSo, for some permutation, the lines don't intersect.\n\nAnother example:\n\nInput:\n\n2 2\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\nbases:\n\n0 0\n\n1 1\n\nOutput: 'No'\n\nBecause in any permutation, the lines would cross.\n\nWait, no. Let's see.\n\nShips are at (1,0) and (2,2).\n\nBases are at (0,0) and (1,1).\n\nPossible permutations are:\n\n[0,1]: ship0 to (0,0), ship1 to (1,1).\n\nLines are (1,0)-(0,0): horizontal line along x-axis.\n\n(2,2)-(1,1): line from (2,2) to (1,1). These two lines don't intersect except at (1,0) and (0,0) is on the first line, but the other line is from (2,2) to (1,1), which is a diagonal.\n\nWait, wait, let's plot them.\n\nLine 1: from (1,0) to (0,0). It's the line y=0.\n\nLine 2: from (2,2) to (1,1). This is the line y = x.\n\nThese two lines intersect at (0,0) but (0,0) is the endpoint of the first line. Wait, but the second line is from (2,2) to (1,1), which is the line y=x, and it passes through (0,0). So the two lines meet at (0,0), which is an endpoint of the first line and the starting point of the second line.\n\nWait, but the second line starts at (2,2), goes to (1,1). So the point (0,0) is not on the second line. Wait, no: the line from (2,2) to (1,1) is the line y = x, but that line passes through (0,0). However, the segment is from (2,2) to (1,1), which is a part of the line y=x. So the line segments are:\n\nSegment 1: (1,0) to (0,0) is the line from x=1 to x=0, y=0.\n\nSegment 2: (2,2) to (1,1) is the line from (2,2) to (1,1).\n\nDo these two segments intersect?\n\nAt (0,0), segment 1 ends. Segment 2 is from (2,2) to (1,1). So the two segments don't share any common points except possibly at (0,0), which is only an endpoint of segment 1. So they don't intersect.\n\nWait, but wait: the line for segment 2 is y=x. The point (0,0) is on that line, but it's not part of segment 2.\n\nSo the segments do not intersect.\n\nBut wait, that's conflicting with the sample input where the output is 'No'. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the sample input 2 is:\n\nInput:\n\n2 2\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\nbases:\n\n0 0\n\n1 1\n\nSo the output is 'No'.\n\nWait, why?\n\nBecause in any permutation, the lines will cross.\n\nWait, in permutation [0,1], the lines are:\n\nship0 (1,0) to base0 (0,0): line from (1,0) to (0,0).\n\nship1 (2,2) to base1 (1,1): line from (2,2) to (1,1).\n\nDo these two lines intersect?\n\nAs discussed earlier, the lines are y=0 (from (1,0) to (0,0)) and y=x (from (2,2) to (1,1)). These lines cross at (0,0). But the segment from (1,0) to (0,0) ends at (0,0), and the segment from (2,2) to (1,1) is from (2,2) to (1,1). So the point (0,0) is not on the second segment.\n\nWait, but the lines themselves cross at (0,0), which is the endpoint of the first segment. So in terms of the line segments, they only meet at (0,0), which is an endpoint of the first segment.\n\nDoes that count as an intersection? Because the definition says that the paths (lines) from a base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect. So if two paths cross at an endpoint, is that considered an intersection?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane\".\n\nSo if the path from base A to ship X ends at X, and the path from base B to ship Y starts at Y, and these two paths cross at X (or Y), is that considered an intersection?\n\nWait, in the example, the two paths are from base0 to ship0 (path is from (0,0) to (1,0)), and from base1 to ship1 (path is from (1,1) to (2,2)). These two paths are both straight lines. They cross at (1,1)? Wait, no.\n\nWait, the line from (0,0) to (1,0) is y=0 from x=0 to x=1.\n\nThe line from (1,1) to (2,2) is y=x from x=1 to x=2.\n\nThese two lines cross at (1,1), but (1,1) is the starting point of the second path. So the two paths meet at (1,1) only at the start of the second path.\n\nBut the first path is from (0,0) to (1,0), so it's the segment from (0,0) to (1,0). The second path is from (1,1) to (2,2). So the two segments are:\n\nSegment1: (0,0) → (1,0)\n\nSegment2: (1,1) → (2,2)\n\nDo these two segments intersect?\n\nWell, the line for segment1 is y=0, from x=0 to x=1.\n\nThe line for segment2 is y=x, from x=1 to x=2.\n\nThey cross at (1,1), but that's not on segment1 (since segment1 ends at (1,0)), and it's the start of segment2. So the two segments don't intersect except at (1,1), which is not a point on segment1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, segment1 is from (0,0) to (1,0). The line is y=0. Segment2 is from (1,1) to (2,2). The line is y=x. These two lines cross at (1,1), but that point is not on segment1 (which ends at (1,0)). So the two segments do not intersect.\n\nSo in the permutation [0,1], the two lines do not intersect.\n\nSo why is the sample output 'No'?\n\nAh, wait, perhaps I've misread the sample.\n\nLooking back, the sample input for the second case is:\n\nInput:\n\n2 2\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\nbases:\n\n3 1\n\n3 1\n\nWait, no, the sample input is:\n\nThe first input block is:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, the second line is:\n\nThe first line is 3 3, then 3 ship points, then 3 base points.\n\nThen comes '2 1', followed by two ship points and two base points.\n\nWait, perhaps the second sample is:\n\nR=2, B=1.\n\nWait, no, the first line is R and B.\n\nWait, perhaps the first sample is:\n\nR=3, B=3.\n\nShips:\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nBases:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSecond sample:\n\nR=2, B=1.\n\nShips:\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\nBases:\n\n3 1\n\nSo R=2, B=1. So R != B, so output 'No'.\n\nWait, but in that case, the code would output 'No' because R != B.\n\nBut the sample output is ['Yes', 'No'].\n\nWait, perhaps the initial input is structured differently. Maybe the first line is R and B, then R ship points, then B base points.\n\nSo the first sample's input is:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nThen, the second case is:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nSo R=2, B=1. R != B, so output 'No'.\n\nSo the sample outputs are 'Yes' and 'No' for the two test cases.\n\nWait, but in the code, when R != B, we output 'No' immediately. So the code will output 'No' for the second case.\n\nThus, the sample is handled correctly.\n\nNow, back to the second example.\n\nWait, perhaps the second sample's R and B are both 2, but the bases are arranged such that any permutation causes lines to intersect.\n\nWait, let's think of the second sample.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 2\n\nShip 1: (1, 0)\n\nShip 2: (2, 2)\n\nBase 1: (0, 0)\n\nBase 2: (1, 1)\n\nSo possible permutations are:\n\n[0,1] and [1,0].\n\nFor permutation [0,1]:\n\nLines are:\n\nShip0 to Base0: from (1,0) to (0,0).\n\nShip1 to Base1: from (2,2) to (1,1).\n\nDo these two lines intersect?\n\nYes, because the line from (1,0) to (0,0) is y=0, and the line from (2,2) to (1,1) is y=x.\n\nThese two lines cross at (0,0), but the second line starts at (2,2) and goes to (1,1), so (0,0) is not part of the second line.\n\nWait, but the line for the second line is y=x, which passes through (0,0), but the segment is from (2,2) to (1,1), so it's the line from x=2 to x=1. So the segments do not intersect.\n\nWait, perhaps my confusion is arising because I'm mixing lines and line segments.\n\nSo, in the permutation [0,1], the lines are:\n\nLine1: from (1,0) to (0,0) → segment (1,0)-(0,0).\n\nLine2: from (2,2) to (1,1) → segment (2,2)-(1,1).\n\nThese two segments do not intersect because they are on different lines and do not cross.\n\nBut wait, the line for Line2 is y=x, which passes through (0,0), but that's not part of Line2's segment.\n\nSo the segments do not intersect.\n\nThus, the permutation [0,1] would be valid, which would cause the code to output 'Yes'.\n\nBut according to the sample, the output is 'No'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says that any two paths from a base to its assigned spaceship must not intersect.\n\nSo, for permutation [0,1], Ship0 is assigned to Base0, and Ship1 is assigned to Base1.\n\nThe path from Base0 to Ship0 is the line segment from (0,0) to (1,0).\n\nThe path from Base1 to Ship1 is the line segment from (1,1) to (2,2).\n\nDo these two segments intersect?\n\nLet's compute.\n\nLine segment A: (0,0) → (1,0). It's a horizontal line.\n\nLine segment B: (1,1) → (2,2). It's a diagonal line.\n\nDo they intersect?\n\nWe can compute:\n\nLine A is from (0,0) to (1,0). Any point on this line is (x, 0) where x is between 0 and 1.\n\nLine B is from (1,1) to (2,2). Any point on this line is (t, t) where t is between 1 and 2.\n\nSo, the two lines intersect at (1,1), but that point is on Line B but not on Line A.\n\nWait, but (1,1) is on Line B but not on Line A. So the two line segments do not share any common points except perhaps at (1,1), which is not part of Line A.\n\nThus, the segments do not intersect.\n\nSo the permutation [0,1] would be valid, leading to 'Yes'.\n\nBut according to the sample, the output is 'No'.\n\nSo perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem considers that the two paths cross each other even if they don't share any points.\n\nNo, that can't be. The problem says that the paths should not intersect. So if the two segments cross at a point that is not part of either segment, that's acceptable.\n\nWait, no. Because the path is a straight line between the base and the ship. So if the two paths cross each other at a point that is not on either path, but their lines cross elsewhere, that's still an intersection.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the paths (as straight lines) should not intersect. So the line segments themselves must not intersect.\n\nSo, if the line segments AB and CD cross each other at a point that is not part of either segment, that's not considered an intersection. Because the segments are from A to B, and C to D, and their lines cross somewhere else.\n\nBut in the case of the permutation [0,1], the lines are:\n\nLine AB: from (1,0) to (0,0) → line y=0.\n\nLine CD: from (2,2) to (1,1) → line y=x.\n\nThese two lines cross at (0,0), but the line AB ends at (0,0), and line CD starts at (2,2) and goes to (1,1). So the segments do not cross each other.\n\nWait, no. Because line AB is from (1,0) to (0,0). Line CD is from (2,2) to (1,1). Their lines cross at (0,0), but the segments are:\n\nAB: from (1,0) to (0,0) → includes (0,0).\n\nCD: from (2,2) to (1,1) → does not include (0,0).\n\nSo the segments do not intersect.\n\nThus, the permutation [0,1] is valid.\n\nSo why does the sample output 'No'?\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the path from the base to the ship is the entire line, not just the segment.\n\nNo, that's not the case. The problem says that the assignment is a perfect matching, meaning each base is connected to exactly one ship, and each ship to exactly one base. So the paths are the line segments between the two points.\n\nSo, in the permutation [0,1], the two paths are:\n\nBase0 → Ship0: (0,0) → (1,0) → line segment AB.\n\nBase1 → Ship1: (1,1) → (2,2) → line segment CD.\n\nThese two segments do not intersect.\n\nSo why is the output 'No' for this case?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sample input.\n\nLooking back at the sample input:\n\nThe second sample's input is:\n\n['2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, perhaps R=2, B=1. So R != B, so output 'No'.\n\nAh, that's it!\n\nSo in that case, the code correctly outputs 'No' because R != B.\n\nBut in the first sample, R=3, B=3, so the code proceeds to check permutations.\n\nThus, the sample outputs are correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing another example.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nR=2, B=2.\n\nShips:\n\n(0,0), (2,0)\n\nBases:\n\n(1,1), (3,3)\n\nPermutation [0,1]:\n\nLines are:\n\nShip0 → Base0: (0,0) → (1,1).\n\nShip1 → Base1: (2,0) → (3,3).\n\nDo these lines intersect?\n\nThe line from (0,0) to (1,1) is y=x.\n\nThe line from (2,0) to (3,3) is y=x + (-2).\n\nThese two lines are parallel and do not intersect.\n\nSo the permutation is valid.\n\nThus, output 'Yes'.\n\nAnother permutation:\n\nShip0 → Base1, Ship1 → Base0.\n\nLines:\n\n(0,0) → (3,3): y=(3/3)x = y=x.\n\n(2,0) → (1,1): y = (1-0)/(1-2)(x - 2) → y= - (x-2) → y=",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to assign Rebel spaceships to guard B bases such that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. Additionally, the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship must not intersect in 2D space.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires a perfect matching between R Rebel spaceships and B bases. Each spaceship must be assigned to exactly one base and vice versa. The key constraint is that the paths (line segments) from each base to its assigned spaceship should not intersect.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: Since no two points coincide and no three points are colinear, any two line segments either do not intersect or intersect at exactly one point. We can use the concept of orientation to check for line segment intersections efficiently.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We will use permutations to generate all possible assignments of bases to ships. For each permutation, we will check if any pair of line segments (from the assignment) intersects. If we find a permutation where none of the line segments intersect, we output \"Yes\". If all permutations result in intersecting segments, we output \"No\".\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Given the constraints (R, B ≤ 10), the number of permutations is manageable (up to 10! = 3,628,800 permutations). Each permutation check involves up to 45 pairs of line segments, making the solution feasible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef ccw(a, b, c):\n    return (b[0] - a[0]) * (c[1] - a[1]) - (b[1] - a[1]) * (c[0] - a[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    ccw1 = ccw(a, b, c)\n    ccw2 = ccw(a, b, d)\n    ccw3 = ccw(c, d, a)\n    ccw4 = ccw(c, d, b)\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    R = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    B = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    \n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    \n    ships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x = int(input[ptr])\n        y = int(input[ptr+1])\n        ships.append((x, y))\n        ptr += 2\n    \n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x = int(input[ptr])\n        y = int(input[ptr+1])\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        ptr += 2\n    \n    for perm in itertools.permutations(range(B)):\n        lines = []\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            s = ships[i]\n            b = bases[perm[i]]\n            lines.append( (s, b) )\n        \n        for i in range(len(lines)):\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(lines)):\n                a, b = lines[i]\n                c, d = lines[j]\n                if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    \n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into ship and base coordinates.\n2. **Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, we generate all possible ways to assign bases to ships.\n3. **Line Segments Check**: For each permutation, we create line segments between ships and their assigned bases. We then check each pair of these line segments for intersection using the cross product method to determine orientation.\n4. **Output Result**: If any permutation results in non-intersecting line segments, we print \"Yes\". If all permutations fail, we print \"No\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible assignments and determine if a valid configuration exists.",
