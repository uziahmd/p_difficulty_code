His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The input gives me the number of participants (n), the minimum points Vasya got (x), and the points each participant earned in both tours. But the points for each tour are given in arbitrary order, meaning I don't know which is which.\n\nHmm. So the key is that for each participant, their total points are a_i + b_j for some i and j. Wait, no. Wait, each participant has exactly one a and one b. So the a's and b's are lists where each list contains all the a_i's and b_j's respectively, but not sorted in any particular way.\n\nSo, to find the sum for each participant, I need to pair each a_i with a b_j such that each a is paired once and each b is paired once. Oh right, because each participant took part in both tours. So the pairing must be a perfect matching between the a's and b's.\n\nWait, but the problem says that Vasya is present, so there exists at least one pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= x.\n\nMy goal is to compute the best and worst possible ranks Vasya can have. The rank is determined by the total points, sorted in descending order. If two participants have the same total, the jury can arrange them in any order, so for the purposes of determining the best and worst ranks, I have to consider all possibilities, including whether someone else has a higher or lower sum.\n\nSo, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I think I need to generate all possible pairings of a's and b's, compute the total for each participant, then determine Vasya's position in the sorted list.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 105, which makes generating all possible pairings computationally expensive. Because for each a, you have to pair it with a unique b, so the number of possible pairings is n! / (n-n)! )? No, wait, for n elements, the number of possible bijections (permutations) is n! because each permutation represents a unique pairing.\n\nBut 105! is way too big; that's impossible to compute directly. So I need a smarter way.\n\nHmm, perhaps instead of trying all possible pairings, I can model this as a problem where I need to assign each a_i to a b_j in such a way that each is used exactly once, and then compute the total for each participant.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is structured, the sum for each participant is a_i + b_j, but since the a and b lists are given in arbitrary order, the pairing isn't known. So the sum for each participant depends on how we match a's and b's.\n\nWait, but the problem isn't about the exact pairings, but about the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have, given that he has a certain sum s = a_p + b_q, where p and q are some indices.\n\nSo, the approach should be:\n\n1. For each possible s that Vasya could have (s >= x), find the best possible rank and the worst possible rank.\n\nBut how do I find all possible s that Vasya could have? Because for any pairing, Vasya's s is a_i + b_j, which is determined by the pairing.\n\nWait, but considering all possible pairings would result in different s values for Vasya. However, since the problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks, perhaps I can model the problem by considering all possible s that Vasya can have, and for each s, calculate what is the maximum number of participants that could have a sum greater than s, and the minimum number of participants that could have a sum less than or equal to s.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's think differently.\n\nFor the best possible rank, we want as few participants as possible to have a sum higher than Vasya's. So to maximize Vasya's rank, we should choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is as high as possible, while also having others' sums as low as possible.\n\nWait, no. To get the best possible rank, we need Vasya's sum to be as high as possible, and others' sums to be as low as possible. So the best rank is 1 if Vasya's sum is the highest possible.\n\nBut how to find the maximum possible sum Vasya can have. That's the maximum a_i + b_j, because in the best case, Vasya is the top scorer.\n\nWait, but no: because the a's and b's are given in arbitrary order. So for example, if the a's are [3,2,1] and b's are [4,5,6], then pairing a[0] with b[0] gives 7, which is the maximum possible. So in the best case, Vasya can have that maximum sum.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya's sum is at least x. So for the best possible rank, we can have Vasya's sum as high as possible, possibly the maximum possible sum in the competition.\n\nWait, but perhaps the maximum possible sum is when we pair the largest a with the largest b.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is 1 if Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, but that depends on how the a's and b's are paired.\n\nWait, no. Because the a's and b's are given in arbitrary order, but each participant has one a and one b. So the maximum sum is the maximum of a_i + b_j for all possible pairs, but each a and b can only be used once.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because each a is paired with exactly one b, so the maximum sum for any participant is the maximum of a_i + b_j for some i and j, but in a way that each a is used exactly once.\n\nSo, for example, if a is [10, 1], and b is [9, 2], then pairing 10 with 9 gives a sum of 19, and 1+2=3. So the maximum possible sum is 19, and the minimum is 3.\n\nIn this case, if Vasya's sum is 19, then he is first. If it's 3, he is last.\n\nBut in our problem, the a and b lists are given, but the pairing is unknown. So for the best possible rank, we can imagine that the a and b are paired in a way that maximizes Vasya's sum.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is achieved when Vasya's sum is as large as possible, and others' sums are as small as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the best possible rank is 1, but sometimes it can't be achieved. Or maybe not, depending on other constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to approach this is:\n\nFor the best possible rank:\n\n- Find the maximum possible sum s that Vasya can have. Then, compute how many participants can have a sum >= s. The best rank is 1 plus the number of participants who have sum > s, plus any ties where they can be placed above Vasya.\n\nWait, but in the best case, Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, so others can't have a higher sum. So the best rank is 1.\n\nWait, but that might not always be the case. For example, suppose there's another participant whose sum is equal to Vasya's maximum possible sum. Then, the jury can assign their rank higher than Vasya's, making Vasya's rank worse.\n\nAh, right. So for the best possible rank, we need to make sure that Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and that no other participant has a higher sum. But if multiple participants can have the same sum as Vasya's maximum, then the best possible rank is 1, but in the worst case, it could be 1 plus the number of participants with the same sum.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the jury can arrange the ties as they like. So for the best rank, we can assume that Vasya is placed first among those with the maximum sum. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst possible rank, we want Vasya's sum to be as small as possible, and as many participants as possible to have a higher sum than him.\n\nWait, but Vasya's sum must be at least x. So for the worst rank, we need to choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is as small as possible (but >=x) and as many others as possible have larger sums.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should look for a way to model all possible pairings, compute for each possible s (Vasya's sum), and for each s, compute the best and worst possible ranks.\n\nBut with n up to 105, that's computationally heavy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the problem by considering that for the best rank, the maximum possible s is the sum of the maximum a and maximum b. Then, the best rank is 1.\n\nWait, but what if another participant also has a sum equal to s_max? Then, in the best case, Vasya can be placed first among those with s_max, so the best rank remains 1.\n\nWait, but what about the worst case? In the worst case, for the best rank, perhaps Vasya can't be first, but for the best possible scenario, he can be.\n\nSo perhaps the best possible rank is 1, assuming that Vasya's sum is the maximum possible.\n\nBut that's not necessarily correct. Suppose that the maximum possible sum is achieved by more than one participant, but in the best case, Vasya can be first among them.\n\nWait, but in the best case, the jury can arrange the tiebreakers in a way that Vasya is first. So for the best possible rank, it's 1.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nYes, I think so. Because regardless of how many participants have the same maximum sum, the best possible rank for Vasya is 1.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, Vasya's sum is as high as possible, which is the sum of the maximum a and maximum b.\n\nWait, but wait: the a and b are given in arbitrary order, but each a is paired with a unique b. So the maximum sum is indeed a_i + b_j where a_i is the maximum a and b_j is the maximum b.\n\nBecause even if a is [5, 3], b is [4, 6], then pairing 5 with 6 gives 11, which is the maximum possible.\n\nSo yes, the maximum sum is (max_a + max_b), where max_a is the maximum element in a and max_b is the maximum in b.\n\nThus, for the best possible rank, Vasya's sum is max_a + max_b, and the best rank is 1.\n\nWait, but wait. Suppose that the a list is [5, 5], and the b list is [5,5]. Then the maximum sum is 10, and all participants have sum 10. So the best rank is 1, but the worst is also 1, but in reality, Vasya's rank could be anything between 1 and n.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the best and worst ranks are based on the possible pairings, so for the best possible, he is first, and for the worst possible, he is last.\n\nSo in that case, for the best rank, it's 1, and for the worst, it's n.\n\nWait, but let's take the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n5 2\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nAll participants have sum 2. So Vasya's best rank is 1, worst is 5.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: sample input 2:\n\nn=6, x=2.\n\na is [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n\nb is [8,6,0,4,3,4].\n\nWait, the maximum a is 6, maximum b is 8. So 6+8=14. So best rank is 1.\n\nBut wait, in the sample output, the best rank is 1, which aligns with this.\n\nSo, the conclusion is: for the best possible rank, the maximum possible sum is the sum of the maximum a and maximum b.\n\nThus, the best rank is 1.\n\nWait, but what about if the maximum a is paired with a non-maximum b? Like, maybe if the maximum a is paired with a smaller b, then someone else can have a higher sum.\n\nNo, because that's the best possible for Vasya. So for the best possible rank, we want to pair the maximum a with the maximum b.\n\nSo yes, the best possible sum is max_a + max_b.\n\nThus, the best rank is 1.\n\nNow, for the worst possible rank.\n\nWe need to find the minimal possible rank for Vasya, given that his sum is at least x.\n\nTo minimize his rank (i.e., make it as bad as possible), we need to have as many participants as possible with a sum higher than Vasya's, and as few as possible with a sum lower than Vasya's.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet's think: For the worst possible rank, we need to pair the a's and b's in a way that:\n\n- Vasya's sum is as small as possible (but >=x).\n\n- As many other participants as possible have a sum higher than Vasya's.\n\nSo, to minimize Vasya's rank, we need to maximize the number of participants with sum > s, where s is Vasya's sum.\n\nBut how?\n\nWe can model this as follows:\n\nWe need to find s >= x, such that the number of participants (including Vasya) with sum > s is as large as possible.\n\nWait, but for the worst case, Vasya's sum is s, and as many other participants as possible have sum > s.\n\nSo the worst possible rank is 1 + the number of participants with sum > s.\n\nBut how do we find the minimal possible rank, which would correspond to the maximal number of participants with sum > s.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal possible rank is 1 + the maximum number of participants that can have sum > s, where s is Vasya's sum.\n\nBut s must be >= x.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst possible rank is determined by the minimal possible s (>=x) that allows the maximum number of participants to have sum > s.\n\nWait, that sounds a bit vague. Let me try to think of a way to model this.\n\nIdea:\n\nWe need to choose a pairing of a's and b's such that:\n\n- Vasya's sum is s >= x.\n\n- The number of participants with sum > s is as large as possible.\n\nThus, the worst possible rank is 1 + (number of participants with sum > s).\n\nTo maximize the number of participants with sum > s, we need to arrange the pairing so that as many participants as possible have a high sum, while Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but >=x).\n\nBut how to find this.\n\nPerhaps, for the worst possible rank, we can try to find the minimal possible s (>=x) such that the maximum number of participants can have sum > s.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps to find s as low as possible (but >=x), but in such a way that as many participants as possible can have sum > s.\n\nSo, to maximize the number of participants with sum > s, we can try to set s as low as possible, but still allowing as many a_i + b_j pairs to be as high as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the worst possible rank is determined by the minimal possible s (>=x) that allows the maximum number of participants to have sum > s.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nAlternative approach: For all possible s >=x, compute the maximum possible number of participants that can have sum > s. Then, the worst possible rank is 1 + that maximum number.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right, because s is Vasya's sum, so it's fixed. So for a given s, the number of participants with sum > s is the count of participants in the pairing where their sum is > s.\n\nThus, for each possible s >=x, compute the maximum possible count of participants with sum > s, given that one of the participants has sum s.\n\nWait, but how do we choose s and the pairing to maximize the count.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can model this as a binary search problem.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to precompute for each possible s (from x to max_total), the maximum number of participants that can have sum > s, given that Vasya's sum is s.\n\nWait, but that sounds computationally intensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the worst case, we can find the minimal possible s (>=x) such that as many participants as possible can have sum > s.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think differently.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of participants that can have sum > s, given that s is >=x.\n\nTo maximize the number, we need to pair a's and b's in such a way that as many participants as possible have a high sum, while Vasya's sum is s.\n\nThus, perhaps the worst possible rank is determined by the minimal s (>=x) that allows the maximum number of participants to have sum > s.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal s is x, but that may not allow enough participants to have sum > s.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. Enumerate all possible s >=x.\n\n2. For each s, compute the maximum possible number of participants that can have sum > s, given that Vasya's sum is s.\n\n3. The worst possible rank is the minimum (over all possible s) of (1 + maximum number of participants with sum > s).\n\nWait, but how to compute for each s the maximum number of participants with sum > s.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given s, the maximum number of participants with sum > s is the maximum over all possible pairings, where one of the participants has sum s.\n\nBut this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each s, we can compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum > s, assuming that one of the participants (Vasya) has sum s.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nSo, for each s >=x:\n\n- We need to assign the a's and b's to participants such that one of them (Vasya) has sum s, and the rest have sum as high as possible.\n\nWait, but how to model this.\n\nPerhaps, for each s, we can model the problem as follows:\n\nWe need to pair a's and b's in such a way that one of the pairs has sum s, and the rest are paired to maximize the number of pairs with sum > s.\n\nSo, for each s, we can compute the maximum possible number of participants with sum > s, given that Vasya's sum is s.\n\nThen, the worst possible rank is 1 + this number.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think of this as a problem where, for a given s, I need to find the maximum number of participants that can have sum > s, given that Vasya's sum is s.\n\nThe steps for this could be:\n\n1. For each possible s, starting from x upwards.\n\n2. Compute the maximum number of participants (excluding Vasya) that can have sum > s, given that one participant (Vasya) has sum s.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given s, the maximum number of participants with sum > s is the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j > s, but with the constraint that exactly one pair sums to s (Vasya's pair), and the rest are as per the pairing.\n\nSo, for each s, the problem reduces to:\n\nFind the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j > s, given that exactly one pair sums to s, and each a and b is used exactly once.\n\nThis seems like a bipartite matching problem, but with the added constraint that one edge (pair) must sum to s.\n\nWait, but for each s, how can we compute this quickly.\n\nAn alternative approach: for a given s, the maximum number of participants with sum > s is equal to the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can be formed such that a_i + b_j > s, minus the number of pairs that cannot be formed without overlapping a's and b's.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAnother idea: for a given s, the maximum number of participants with sum > s is the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j > s, given that exactly one pair sums to s.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- Choose one a and one b such that a + b = s.\n\n- Then, pair the remaining a's and b's in a way that as many as possible have a sum > s.\n\nThe maximum number of such pairs is the required value.\n\nThus, for each possible a_i and b_j such that a_i + b_j = s, compute the maximum number of pairs (a', b') where a' + b' > s, and a' is from the remaining a's, b' from the remaining b's.\n\nThen, the maximum over all possible (a_i, b_j) pairs is the maximum number of participants with sum > s.\n\nOnce we have that, the worst possible rank is 1 plus that maximum.\n\nBut the problem is that for each s, we'd have to check all possible (a_i, b_j) pairs that sum to s, and for each, compute the maximum possible number of pairs > s.\n\nThis could be computationally expensive, especially since s can be up to 2*105 = 210.\n\nWait, but n is up to 105, which suggests that O(n^3) algorithms might be feasible.\n\nLet me outline the plan.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Precompute all possible s that can be achieved by any a_i + b_j. Since s must be >=x, and it's given that at least one such s exists, we can collect all possible s >=x.\n\nBut for the worst case, we need to consider all possible s >=x.\n\nBut even for s up to 210, it's manageable.\n\n2. For each s in the possible s >=x:\n\n   a. Enumerate all possible (a_i, b_j) pairs that sum to s.\n\n   b. For each such (a_i, b_j):\n\n      i. Remove a_i from a's and b_j from b's.\n\n      ii. Now, find the maximum number of pairs (a', b') from the remaining a's and b's that sum to >s.\n\n      iii. The maximum number of such pairs is the count for this (a_i, b_j).\n\n   c. Among all possible (a_i, b_j) pairs that sum to s, take the maximum count.\n\n   d. The worst possible rank for this s is 1 + count.\n\n3. After processing all s, the overall worst possible rank is the minimum of all these (1 + count) values.\n\nBut wait, why the minimum?\n\nBecause for each s, the worst rank is 1 + count, and among all possible s, we choose the s that allows the smallest possible rank.\n\nWait, no. Because for a higher s, the count may be higher, leading to a worse rank.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: for s being higher, the condition a + b > s becomes harder to satisfy, so the count decreases. So for higher s, the count is lower, leading to a better (smaller) rank.\n\nThus, for the worst possible rank, which is the minimal possible rank, we need to choose the s that gives the highest possible count.\n\nWait, no. Because for higher s, the count is smaller, leading to a worse rank. So for example, if s is as small as possible, the count can be as large as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the worst possible rank is the minimal possible rank that Vasya can have. So for the worst possible rank, we want Vasya's sum to be as small as possible (but >=x), and as many other participants as possible to have sum > s.\n\nSo, for each s >=x, the number of participants with sum > s is the count.\n\nThe worst possible rank is 1 + count, and we need to find the minimal possible rank, which corresponds to the s that allows the largest count.\n\nThus, for the worst possible rank, we need to find the s >=x that allows the maximum possible count.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\nFor each s >=x:\n\n   For each possible (a_i, b_j) that sum to s:\n\n      Compute the maximum possible count of pairs (a', b') where a' + b' > s.\n\n   Take the maximum count across all (a_i, b_j) for this s.\n\n   Record 1 + count as a possible worst rank.\n\nFinally, the worst possible rank is the minimal possible 1 + count across all s >=x.\n\nWait, no. Because for each s, we can have a different count. We need to find the minimal possible rank, which is the minimal of all 1 + count(s), but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, no. Because for the worst possible rank, we are looking for the worst case scenario, which is the maximum possible 1 + count.\n\nWait, no. The worst possible rank is the smallest possible rank, which is the worst case for Vasya.\n\nWait, no. Because in the worst case, Vasya's rank is as bad as possible, which is as high as possible (like last place). So the worst possible rank is the maximum possible 1 + count.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up between best and worst.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\n- Best possible rank: as high as possible, ideally 1.\n\n- Worst possible rank: as low as possible, which is as bad as possible, like n.\n\nSo, for the worst possible rank, we need to find the scenario where as many participants as possible have a sum higher than Vasya's, making his rank as low as possible.\n\nThus, for each s >=x, the number of participants with sum >s is count. The worst possible rank is 1 + count.\n\nThus, among all possible s >=x, we need to find the s that gives the maximum count, leading to the worst possible rank of 1 + count.\n\nWait, no. Because if s is small, the count can be large, leading to a larger count, thus a worse rank.\n\nYes. So for the worst possible rank, we want the maximum count across all s >=x.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute all possible s >=x.\n\n2. For each s:\n\n   a. Find all (a_i, b_j) pairs that sum to s.\n\n   b. For each such pair:\n\n      i. Remove a_i and b_j.\n\n      ii. Now, find the maximum number of pairs (a', b') from the remaining a's and b's that sum to > s.\n\n   c. The maximum count for s is the maximum of these counts across all (a_i, b_j) pairs.\n\n3. The worst possible rank is 1 + the maximum count across all s >=x.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nCompute for each s >=x the maximum possible count of participants with sum >s, given that Vasya's sum is s.\n\nThe worst possible rank is 1 plus this maximum count.\n\nSo, now the problem reduces to, for each s >=x, find the maximum possible count of pairs (a', b') with a' + b' > s, after choosing a (a_i, b_j) pair that sums to s.\n\nNow, how to compute this.\n\nThe key is, for a given s and a chosen (a_i, b_j) that sums to s, the remaining a's and b's can be paired in any way to maximize the number of pairs with sum >s.\n\nSo, for each (a_i, b_j) that sums to s:\n\n   - Create two lists: remaining_a = a \\ {a_i}, remaining_b = b \\ {b_j}.\n\n   - Now, pair as many as possible of the remaining_a and remaining_b into pairs where a + b > s.\n\n   - The maximum number of such pairs is what we're looking for.\n\nThe question is, how to find this maximum number.\n\nBut for each (a_i, b_j) and s, the problem is to find the maximum matching between the remaining_a and remaining_b, where a + b > s.\n\nThis is essentially a bipartite graph where edges exist between a and b if a + b > s, and we want to find the maximum matching size.\n\nBut with n up to 105, and s up to 210, and the number of possible s up to 210, this could be manageable.\n\nWait, but for each s, and for each possible (a_i, b_j) pair that sums to s, we need to compute the maximum number of pairs in the remaining a and b that sum to > s.\n\nThis could be computationally expensive, but perhaps manageable with the constraints.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nLoop over all possible s from x up to the maximum possible sum (which is 105 + 105 = 210).\n\nFor each s:\n\n   Collect all possible (a_i, b_j) pairs where a_i + b_j == s.\n\n   For each such pair (a_i, b_j):\n\n      Create remaining_a as a list excluding a_i.\n\n      Create remaining_b as a list excluding b_j.\n\n      Now, compute the maximum number of pairs (a', b') where a' is in remaining_a, b' is in remaining_b, and a' + b' > s.\n\n      Keep track of the maximum count for this s.\n\nRecord the maximum count across all s.\n\nThe worst possible rank is 1 plus this maximum count.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this efficiently.\n\nHow to compute the maximum number of pairs for a given s and remaining a and b.\n\nThis is a bipartite matching problem where we need to find the maximum number of edges where a + b > s.\n\nWe can model this as a bipartite graph where each a is connected to each b that, when summed, is > s.\n\nWe need to find the maximum matching in this graph.\n\nThe Hopcroft-Karp algorithm can be used for this, which runs in O(E√V) time. Here, E is the number of edges, which could be up to (105)^2 for each s and pair.\n\nGiven that n is up to 105, and for each s and pair, the Hopcroft-Karp runs in acceptable time.\n\nThus, the steps for the code:\n\n1. Read n, x.\n\n2. Read a and b arrays.\n\n3. Generate all possible s >=x.\n\n4. For each s in this range:\n\n   a. Generate all possible (i, j) pairs where a[i] + b[j] == s.\n\n   b. For each such (i, j):\n\n      i. Create remaining_a = a[:i] + a[i+1:].\n\n      ii. Create remaining_b = b[:j] + b[j+1:].\n\n      iii. Compute the maximum number of pairs in remaining_a and remaining_b where a + b > s.\n\n      iv. Keep track of the maximum count for this s.\n\n5. After processing all s, the worst possible rank is 1 plus the maximum count across all s.\n\n6. The best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, but earlier analysis suggested that the best possible rank is 1, which is always achievable.\n\nWait, but in the sample input 1, the best rank is 1.\n\nBut perhaps that's not always the case. Wait, suppose that the maximum a + maximum b is s, but another participant also has s. Then, the best possible rank is 1, but the worst is higher.\n\nSo yes, the best possible rank is always 1.\n\nThus, the code will output 1 for the best rank.\n\nWait, but let's verify.\n\nSuppose n=2, a = [3,3], b = [3,3].\n\nThen s can be 6.\n\nAll participants have sum 6. Thus, the best rank is 1, but the worst is 2.\n\nBut according to the code, the best rank is 1, which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this.\n\nBut the problem is that for each s, and for each (i,j) pair that sums to s, we need to compute the maximum number of pairs in the remaining a and b that sum to >s.\n\nImplementing this requires, for each such case, building the bipartite graph and computing the maximum matching.\n\nThus, the code structure in Python could be:\n\n- Read the inputs.\n\n- Precompute all possible s >=x.\n\n- For each s in sorted order (probably from x to max_sum):\n\n   - Generate all possible (i,j) pairs where a[i] + b[j] == s.\n\n   - For each (i,j):\n\n      - Create remaining_a and remaining_b.\n\n      - Create a bipartite graph where a in remaining_a can connect to b in remaining_b if a + b > s.\n\n      - Compute the maximum matching in this graph.\n\n      - Update the maximum count for this s.\n\n- After all s, compute the worst rank as 1 + maximum count.\n\nBut wait, the maximum count across all s is the maximum number of participants with sum > s, which is the count for the worst possible rank.\n\nWait, but for each s, the count is the maximum possible for that s. We need to find the s that gives the maximum count, because that would lead to the worst possible rank.\n\nThus, the code needs to track the global maximum count across all s.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nInitialize max_count = 0.\n\nFor s in all possible s >=x:\n\n   current_max = 0\n\n   for each (i,j) where a[i] + b[j] == s:\n\n       create remaining_a and remaining_b.\n\n       build bipartite graph.\n\n       compute maximum matching.\n\n       if the matching size is larger than current_max:\n\n           current_max = matching_size.\n\n   if current_max > max_count:\n\n       max_count = current_max\n\nworst_rank = 1 + max_count\n\nbest_rank = 1\n\nprint(best_rank, worst_rank)\n\nNow, the implementation of the bipartite graph and maximum matching.\n\nImplementing Hopcroft-Karp is a bit involved.\n\nAlternatively, for each a and b, we can represent the bipartition as a list of possible edges, and then use a standard maximum bipartite matching algorithm.\n\nBut for the sake of efficiency, perhaps using a standard DFS-based approach for each a in a in turn, and see if it can find a matching b.\n\nBut with n=105, the standard approach may be too slow.\n\nAn alternative is to pre-sort the a and b lists in a certain way to make the matching faster.\n\nWait, for the bipartite graph where a can be matched to b if a + b > s, perhaps we can sort the a in descending order and the b in ascending order, and greedily match a to the smallest possible b that satisfies a + b > s.\n\nThis would give the maximum possible number of pairs.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if this greedy approach is correct.\n\nWait, let's say a is sorted in descending order, and b is sorted in ascending order.\n\nFor each a in a's list, in order from largest to smallest:\n\n   find the smallest b in b's list (starting from the beginning) that hasn't been used yet and a + b > s.\n\n   if found, mark b as used and increase the count.\n\nThis is similar to interval scheduling, but perhaps it's optimal for maximizing the number of pairs.\n\nBecause for a larger a, we can pair it with the smallest possible b that allows a + b > s, leaving larger b's for smaller a's.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to sort a in ascending and b in descending order, and for each a in a's list, find the smallest b in b's list (in terms of index) that hasn't been used and a + b > s.\n\nBut I'm not certain if this approach always yields the maximum number of pairs.\n\nBut perhaps this is an efficient way to compute the maximum number of pairs, and it can be implemented quickly.\n\nThus, perhaps the code can proceed as follows for each (remaining_a, remaining_b):\n\n   sort remaining_a in ascending order.\n\n   sort remaining_b in descending order.\n\n   then, for each a in remaining_a:\n\n       find the earliest b in remaining_b that a + b > s.\n\n       if found, increment count and remove b from the list.\n\nThis way, for larger a's, we use the smallest possible b's that satisfy the condition, leaving larger b's for smaller a's, which might not satisfy the condition.\n\nWait, but this may not be optimal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach is correct:\n\nSort a in ascending order, and sort b in ascending order.\n\nFor each a in a's list, in order from largest to smallest:\n\n   find the smallest b in b's list that hasn't been used and a + b > s.\n\n   if found, use it and increment the count.\n\nThis way, larger a's are paired with the smallest possible b's, leaving larger b's for smaller a's.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum matching can be found by using a two-pointer technique.\n\nHere's how:\n\nSort a in ascending order.\n\nSort b in ascending order.\n\nInitialize i = 0, j = len(b)-1, count = 0.\n\nFor each a in a's list:\n\n   while j >= 0 and a + b[j] <= s:\n\n       j -=1\n\n   if j >=0:\n\n       count +=1\n\n       j -=1\n\nThus, for each a in a's list (sorted in ascending order), we try to find the largest possible b (since b is sorted in ascending order) such that a + b > s.\n\nWait, but this may not be",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours.
