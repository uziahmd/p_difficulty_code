Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to check if the pile of letters can exactly form the two names given. Hmm, right.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again. Oh right, the input consists of three lines: guest's name, host's name, and the pile. We need to determine if the pile is a perfect combination of both names without any extra or missing letters.\n\nSo the approach here is probably to count the frequency of each character in all three parts and see if they match.\n\nWait, wait. Wait no. Because the pile is supposed to be exactly the combined letters of the guest and host names. So the total letters in the pile should equal the sum of the letters in guest and host.\n\nSo first step: concatenate the guest and host names into one string. Then compare the frequency of each letter in this concatenated string with the frequency in the pile.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each of the three inputs, we'll process them as follows:\n\n1. Read guest, host, and pile.\n2. Combine guest and host into one string.\n3. Check if the combined string has the same length as the pile. If not, immediately return NO because it's impossible.\n4. Count the frequency of each character in the combined string.\n5. Do the same for the pile.\n6. Compare the two frequency dictionaries. If they match exactly, output YES; else, NO.\n\nBut how do I efficiently count the frequencies in Python? Oh right, the collections.Counter class can help. But I remember that when dealing with case sensitivity, but the problem says all are uppercase letters, so no issues there.\n\nWait, but what about the order of the letters? No, since we're just counting, the order doesn't matter.\n\nSo steps in code:\n\n- Read the three lines. But wait, the way the input is provided is a bit tricky. The user input will have three lines, possibly separated by newlines. So in Python, using input().strip() for each line.\n\nWait, but sometimes, after using split('\\n'), maybe some trailing spaces? No, because the problem says each line is non-empty and contains only uppercase letters. So each line is clean.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # count frequencies\n    from collections import Counter\n    count_combined = Counter(combined)\n    count_pile = Counter(pile)\n    if count_combined == count_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, that's the basic idea. But wait, in the sample input, let's test.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS\nHost: DEDMOROZ\nPile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ → which is the same as the pile. So the code would say YES.\n\nIn sample 2:\n\nGuest: PAPAINOEL\nHost: JOULUPUKKI\nPile: BABONATALE FATHERCHRISTMAS BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER (wait, but in the input, it's one line, right? So the third line is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER?)\n\nWait, perhaps in sample 2, the combined length is:\n\nlen(PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI) = let's calculate:\n\nPAPAINOEL is 8 letters, JOULUPUKKI is 10 letters. Total 18.\n\nThe pile is BABONATALE (9) + FATHERCHRISTMAS (15?) Let's see: FATHERCHRISTMAS is 15 letters. BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER: Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the actual lengths may differ.\n\nBut according to the sample note, in the second case, the pile is missing 'P' and has an extra 'L'. So the code should correctly detect that the counts don't match.\n\nSimilarly, the third sample has an extra 'L', which the code should catch.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the lengths don't match? Like, if combined is longer than the pile, then the code correctly returns NO.\n\nWhat about when the lengths are the same, but the counts are different? That's handled.\n\nSo this approach should cover all cases.\n\nNow, considering possible edge cases:\n\n- All names are empty? But the problem states each line is not empty, so no.\n\n- One of the names is empty? No, same reason.\n\nAnother test case: guest is \"A\", host is \"A\", pile is \"AA\" → should return YES.\n\nAnother case: guest is \"AB\", host is \"CD\", pile is \"ABCDCDAB\" → combined is ABCD, which is 4 letters, and the pile is 8 letters, so code returns NO.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nI think that's the solution. Now, let's write the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the pile of letters found at the door can be used to exactly reconstruct the names of the guest and the host without any extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the three lines of input which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Check Lengths**: If the combined length of the guest's and host's names does not match the length of the pile, print \"NO\" immediately as it is impossible to form the names with the given pile.\n4. **Frequency Counting**: Use a frequency counter to count the occurrences of each character in both the combined string and the pile.\n5. **Comparison**: Compare the frequency counts of the combined string and the pile. If they match exactly, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the exact match of characters by leveraging the properties of frequency counting, which is both time and space efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads three lines from standard input, each representing the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n- **Combining Names**: The guest's and host's names are concatenated into a single string to simulate the combined letters that should form the pile.\n- **Length Check**: The combined length is compared against the pile's length to quickly determine if it's impossible to form the names.\n- **Frequency Counting**: The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to create frequency dictionaries for both the combined string and the pile.\n- **Comparison**: The frequency dictionaries are compared to ensure every character's count matches exactly, ensuring no extra or missing letters.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures correctness by verifying both the length and character composition of the pile.",
