Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Vanya is walking along a street lit by lanterns, and I have to find the minimal radius d such that all points on the street are covered. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each lantern lights a segment of the street from (ai - d) to (ai + d), but considering the boundaries. So for each lantern, the coverage starts at max(0, ai -d) and ends at min(l, ai +d). The goal is to choose d as small as possible so that the union of all these intervals covers the entire [0, l] interval.\n\nHmm, so how do I model this? Maybe it's similar to interval covering problems. But since d is a variable, I need to find the minimal d that satisfies certain conditions based on the lantern positions.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal d is determined by the gaps between the coverage areas of adjacent lanterns. So I should sort the lanterns based on their positions and then look at the regions between them, including the ends of the street.\n\nLet me think step by step:\n\n1. Sort the lanterns' positions in ascending order. This will help in processing them sequentially.\n2. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, determine the gap that needs to be covered. Also, check the start and end of the street if they aren't covered by any lantern.\n3. For each gap, calculate the required d such that the coverage from the left lantern and the right lantern (plus the ends) overlaps enough to cover the gap.\n4. The maximum of these required d's across all gaps will be the minimal d needed.\n\nThat makes sense. So let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll sort the lantern positions. Then, consider the street as a line from 0 to l. The first thing to check is whether 0 is covered by any lantern. If not, the initial part up to the first lantern's coverage needs to be handled. Similarly, the end l must be covered.\n\nThen, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, say ai and aj (where ai < aj), the area between ai +d and aj -d might leave a gap. We need to ensure that (aj -d) >= (ai +d), which isn't possible unless the distance between ai and aj is covered by 2d. Wait, no, because the coverage of ai is up to ai +d, and aj's starts at aj -d. So the maximum of (aj -d) should be >= the minimum of (ai +d) + something. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.\n\nWait, for two lanterns at x and y (x < y), the combined coverage without any d would be x +d and y -d. The region from x +d to y -d must be covered. Wait, no. Because the coverage of x is from x-d to x+d, and y's is y-d to y+d. The overlapping regions may or may not cover the area between x and y.\n\nWait, actually, the combined coverage is from min(x-d, y-d) to max(x+d, y+d). So the entire street must be within this coverage. But for the middle parts, the two intervals (from x-d to x+d and y-d to y+d) must overlap enough to cover the entire stretch.\n\nWait, no, the entire street is from 0 to l. So for each point in [0, l], it must be covered by at least one lantern.\n\nSo for two consecutive lanterns, x and y, the area from x to y must be covered. So the coverage from x is up to x+d, and from y starts at y -d. So the maximum of x +d must be >= y -d, otherwise there's a gap between x +d and y -d.\n\nSo the condition is x +d >= y -d. Rearranged, 2d >= y -x. So d >= (y -x)/2. But wait, that's only for the case where the two lanterns are adjacent. Wait, no, because the street is a straight line, and the two lanterns' coverage areas must meet or overlap.\n\nSo for each pair of consecutive lanterns, the required d is (y - x) / 2. But wait, what about when the next lantern is further away? Let's see.\n\nFor example, consider three lanterns: x, y, z with x < y < z.\n\nThe coverage from x is up to x +d, from y is y -d to y +d, and from z is z -d to z +d.\n\nThe critical points are between x and y, y and z, and also the ends 0 and l.\n\nSo for the area between x and y:\n\nWe need x +d >= y -d → 2d >= y - x → d >= (y-x)/2",
