You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vitaly and a graph theory problem. We need to find the minimum number of edges to add to form a simple cycle of odd length, with more than one vertex. And also count the number of ways to do this.\n\nHmm. So the graph is undirected, no loops or parallel edges. It's not necessarily connected.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand what's required. We need to find the smallest t such that adding t edges can form an odd-length cycle (at least 3 vertices). Also, w is the number of ways to achieve this.\n\nWait, but how? Because adding edges could create multiple possible cycles. But the key is that the resulting cycle must be simple (no repeated vertices) and of odd length.\n\nSo, my approach needs to be something like:\n\n1. For each connected component in the graph, determine if it already has a cycle. If it's a tree, then adding edges to form a cycle might require certain steps.\n2. But since we're looking for an odd-length cycle, maybe the parity of the component's structure matters.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this per connected component. Because adding edges within a component can only affect that component's ability to form a cycle.\n\nSo, let's think about each connected component separately.\n\nFor each connected component, I'll consider its properties. Let's say the component has c vertices and e edges. The component could be a tree (e = c-1), or have some cycles.\n\nWhat determines whether the component can contribute to forming an odd cycle?\n\nIf the component already has an odd-length cycle, then t=0, and w is the number of such cycles. Or wait, no: because the question requires adding edges, but if the component already has a cycle, perhaps we can choose whether to use existing edges or not. Wait no, the problem says \"add edges\" to form a cycle, so perhaps the existing edges are part of the graph, but any new edges can be added to form a cycle.\n\nWait, no. The problem says, the graph is given, and we can add edges. So the original graph may already contain cycles, but perhaps those are even-length. So adding edges could help in making it possible to form an odd-length cycle.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me restate the problem:\n\nWe need to find the minimal number of edges to add such that after adding these edges, there exists a simple cycle of odd length (length >=3) where each vertex appears at most once.\n\nMoreover, the cycle can consist of multiple components, but it must be a single cycle. Oh wait, no, the cycle is a simple cycle, which is a single cycle, so it's a connected path.\n\nWait, but the cycle must be formed by the union of the original edges and the added edges. So the problem is to ensure that, in the entire graph, there exists a cycle that is simple and of odd length.\n\nBut wait, the cycle can be formed by combining multiple components. For example, if two components each have a path to a common node, then adding an edge between them could form a longer cycle.\n\nWait, no. Because the cycle is a single cycle, all nodes in it must be connected in a loop. So perhaps each connected component must contribute to the cycle in some way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be broken down into considering each connected component and seeing how they can be combined to form an odd-length cycle.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to consider that for the entire graph, the minimal t is determined based on the presence of certain structures in the connected components.\n\nLet me think about the conditions under which a connected component can be part of an odd-length cycle.\n\nCase 1: The component itself is a tree. Then, any cycle that includes this component must come from adding edges. So, for a tree component, what is the minimal way to add edges to form an odd cycle.\n\nIn a tree, adding one edge creates exactly one cycle. The length of this cycle is the distance between two nodes plus one. So, the cycle length depends on which two nodes we connect.\n\nWait, but for trees, adding an edge between u and v creates a cycle whose length is equal to the number of edges on the path between u and v plus one. So, the length could be even or odd.\n\nSo, in a tree, adding one edge creates a cycle. The length of that cycle depends on the path between the two nodes. So, if there's a pair of nodes in the tree with a path of even length, then adding an edge would create a cycle of even length +1, which is odd. Similarly, if the path is odd, adding an edge creates an even-length cycle.\n\nSo, in a tree component, is it possible to find two nodes such that their path length is even, thus allowing us to add one edge to create an",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of edges to add to a graph to form a simple cycle of odd length and count the number of ways to achieve this. The graph is undirected, has no loops or parallel edges, and may not be connected.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Analysis**: We analyze each connected component of the graph separately. For each component, we determine if it can contribute to forming an odd-length cycle.\n2. **Tree Components**: If a component is a tree (i.e., it has `n` vertices and `n-1` edges), adding one edge can create a cycle. The cycle's length depends on the path between the two vertices connected by the new edge. If there exists a pair of vertices with an even path length, adding one edge will form an odd-length cycle.\n3. **Non-Tree Components**: If a component already contains a cycle, check if it has an odd-length cycle. If it does, no additional edges are needed. If it doesn't, determine if adding edges can transform existing cycles into odd-length ones.\n4. **Cycle Length Check**: For each component, check if it can form an odd-length cycle either by itself or through connecting other components.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for _ in range(m):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n    \n    # Preprocess degrees\n    degree = [len(edges[i]) for i in range(n+1)]\n    \n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    min_t = float('inf')\n    ways = 0\n    \n    # For each connected component, process it\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            q = deque()\n            q.append(i)\n            visited[i] = True\n            component = []\n            while q:\n                u = q.popleft()\n                component.append(u)\n                for v in edges[u]:\n                    if not visited[v]:\n                        visited[v] = True\n                        q.append(v)\n            c = len(component)\n            e = sum(len(edges[u]) for u in component) - c\n            if e < c-1:\n                # This is impossible since the graph is simple\n                pass\n            else:\n                # It's not a tree\n                # Check if there's an odd cycle\n                has_odd_cycle = False\n                for u in component:\n                    if degree[u] % 2 == 1:\n                        # Maybe there's an odd cycle\n                        # But not necessarily\n                        pass\n                # If it's a tree (e == c-1)\n                if e == c-1:\n                    # We can form a cycle by adding one edge\n                    # Now, check if there exists a pair of nodes with even distance\n                    dist = {}\n                    q = deque()\n                    q.append((i, 0))\n                    found_even = False\n                    while q:\n                        u, d = q.popleft()\n                        if u in dist:\n                            continue\n                        dist[u] = d\n                        for v in edges[u]:\n                            if v not in dist:\n                                q.append((v, d+1))\n                    # Check all pairs in component\n                    possible = False\n                    for u in component:\n                        for v in component:\n                            if u != v and (dist[u] + dist[v] + 1) % 2 == 1:\n                                possible = True\n                                break\n                        if possible:\n                            break\n                    if possible:\n                        t_candidate = 1\n                        ways_candidate = 0\n                        # Now, find the number of such pairs\n                        # To count the number of pairs (u, v) where u < v and distance is even\n                        # So that adding edge u-v creates a cycle of odd length\n                        count_pairs = 0\n                        for u in component:\n                            for v in component:\n                                if u != v and (dist[u] + dist[v] + 1) % 2 == 1:\n                                    if u < v:\n                                        count_pairs += 1\n                        ways_candidate = count_pairs\n                        if t_candidate < min_t:\n                            min_t = t_candidate\n                            ways = ways_candidate\n                        elif t_candidate == min_t and ways_candidate > ways:\n                            ways = ways_candidate\n                    else:\n                        # Can't form any odd cycle from this component as a tree\n                        pass\n                else:\n                    # It's a non-tree component.
