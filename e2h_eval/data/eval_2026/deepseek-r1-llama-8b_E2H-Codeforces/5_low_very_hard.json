Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem called Colored Boots. Let me try to understand what it's asking for.\n\nWe have n left boots and n right boots. Each boot has a color represented by a lowercase letter or a question mark. Two boots can form a pair if their colors are compatible. Compatibility is defined as either they are the same specific color or one is a question mark. So for example, 'a' and 'a' are compatible, '?' and 'b' are compatible, but 'a' and 'b' are not.\n\nOur goal is to find the maximum number of pairs possible such that each boot is used at most once. Also, we need to output these pairs along with their indices.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Well, let's think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, the constraints. N can be up to 150,000, which is quite large. So any O(n^2) approach is definitely out of the question. We need something efficient, probably O(n log n) time.\n\nLet me consider the problem in terms of frequencies. For each left boot, I can categorize its color into specific letters and question marks. Similarly for the right boots. Then, for each specific letter, I can find how many lefts and rights have that letter, and see how many pairs can be formed between them. Also, the question marks can contribute to pairs with any other color, including other question marks.\n\nWait, but also, for the question marks, they can pair with any other question mark because both are indefinite. Or wait, no: a left '?' can pair with any right, including another '?', since the right could be a specific letter or a '?'. So for question marks, the left can pair with any right, regardless of what the right is.\n\nSo perhaps the strategy is:\n\n1. Count the frequency of each specific color in left and right. For example, count how many lefts are 'a', 'b', etc., and same for rights.\n\n2. For each specific color c, the number of pairs is the minimum of left_count[c] and right_count[c].\n\n3. Additionally, count the number of question marks in left and right. Let's call them L_q and R_q.\n\n4. The total pairs from specific colors is sum over c of min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]).\n\n5. Then, the question marks can form pairs with all non-paired specific boots. Wait, no. Because after pairing specific colors, some specific boots might still be unpaired, and the question marks can pair with those as well as among themselves.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the process as first matching specific colors, then using the remaining question marks to pair as much as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal way is to:\n\n- For each specific color c, take as many pairs as possible between left and right c's. That gives us the base number of pairs.\n\n- Then, for the remaining left and right question marks, plus any leftovers from specific colors, use the question marks to create as many cross pairs as possible.\n\nWait, but how do we handle the question marks optimally?\n\nAnother idea: the total number of possible pairs is the sum of:\n\n- For each c, the minimum of left_c and right_c.\n\nPlus, the number of question marks in left plus the number of question marks in right, but considering that each pair must consist of one left and one right.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because when you add L_q and R_q, you might have more than the available options.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is equal to the sum of the minimums for each specific color, plus the minimum between (L_q + sum of leftover specific lefts) and (R_q + sum of leftover specific rights), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe that's not accurate. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have some specific color c where left_count[c] > right_count[c]. Then, after taking right_count[c] pairs, there are left_count[c] - right_count[c] left boots of color c that cannot be paired unless they are matched with question marks.\n\nSimilarly, for color d, if right_count[d] > left_count[d], then there are some right boots that couldn't be paired unless they are matched with question marks.\n\nSo, after processing all specific colors, the remaining left specific boots are sum over (left_c - right_c) for all c where left_c > right_c. Similarly, the remaining right specific boots are sum over (right_c - left_c) for all c where right_c > left_c.\n\nBut wait, actually, for each c, the excess is max(0, left_c - right_c) on the left side, and max(0, right_c - left_c) on the right side.\n\nThen, the total number of excess specific boots is E_left + E_right, where E_left is the sum of (left_c",

For each color, we form as many pairs as possible by taking the minimum of the counts from left and right boots. We then handle question marks by forming pairs with any remaining specific boots and among themselves. The indices of the paired boots are collected and printed in the required format. This approach ensures that we maximize the number of compatible pairs efficiently.",
