He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to check if a given string can be formed in a specific way by three friends appending certain characters. Let's break down the problem.\n\nThe problem says that A starts with some 'a's, then B appends some 'b's, and then C appends 'c's. But C has to append a number of 'c's equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string after B's addition. Also, the order must be strictly a's followed by b's followed by c's. So, any other arrangement would make it invalid.\n\nFirst, I think I should parse the input string and count the occurrences of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's. But I also need to ensure the order is correct. So the string must start with one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, then one or more 'c's. If any part of this is violated, the answer is NO.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Check if the string is non-empty and follows the order a's -> b's -> c's.\n2. Count the number of a's, b's, and c's.\n3. Ensure that there is at least one a and one b (since B appends some 'b's after A's initial string which already had some a's).\n4. The count of c's must equal the count of a's or the count of b's. It could be equal to both, but it doesn't have to be.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that since C appends some number of 'c's, the count must be equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's. So the count of c's is either equal to a_count or b_count.\n\nSo first, let's structure the approach.\n\nStep 1: Check the order.\n\nWe can iterate through the string and make sure that all a's come first, then b's, then c's.\n\nHow? We can find the first occurrence of 'b' after the initial a's, and from there on, only 'b's until the first 'c'. Then, after that, only 'c's.\n\nAlternatively, we can split the string into segments. The first segment should consist of 'a's, the second of 'b's, and the third of 'c's. Any deviation means the string is invalid.\n\nSo for example, if the string is 'aaabccc', it's valid. Because it's a's, then b's, then c's.\n\nIf the string is 'aabbaacc', then it's invalid because after the initial a's, there are b's, then a's again, which breaks the order.\n\nSimilarly, if the string is 'aabc', that's a's, then a's again, but wait no—no, the second character is 'a' again, which is allowed? Wait, no. Because after the a's, the next characters should be b's, right?\n\nWait, the order is strict: a's come first, then b's, then c's. So any a after a b is invalid. Similarly, any b after a c is invalid.\n\nSo how can I check this?\n\nOne way is to go through the string and track the current allowed characters. Initially, we're expecting a's. Once a 'b' is encountered, we switch to expecting only b's. After a 'c' is encountered, we switch to expecting only c's. If any violation occurs, the string is invalid.\n\nSo here's an algorithm idea:\n\nInitialize state as 'a'. Iterate through each character:\n\n- If state is 'a':\n   - if char is 'a': continue\n   - if char is 'b': change state to 'b'\n   - if char is 'c': invalid, return NO\n- elif state is 'b':\n   - if char is 'b': continue\n   - if char is 'a': invalid, return NO\n   - if char is 'c': change state to 'c'\n- elif state is 'c':\n   - if char is 'c': continue\n   - else: invalid, return NO\n\nAlso, ensure that there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c' because the problem says that after B's addition, the string has at least one a and one b. Then C adds some c's, so the final string must have at least one a, one b, and one c. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that when C appends, he appends some number of 'c's, which is equal to the number of a's or b's in the string. So the string before C appends has at least one a and one b. So after C appends, the string will have at least one a, one b, and at least one c.\n\nSo, our code needs to check that the string has at least one a, one b, and one c. Otherwise, it's automatically invalid.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nFirst, check that the string is non-empty.\n\nThen, count the number of a's, b's, c's.\n\nCheck that a_count >=1, b_count >=1, c_count >=1.\n\nThen, check the order as per the state transitions above.\n\nOnce the order is correct, proceed to check the counts.\n\nNow, the count of c's must be equal to a_count or b_count.\n\nBecause C appends the same number as either a or b.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where a_count is 0 or b_count is 0? No, because earlier checks ensure that a_count and b_count are at least 1.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Check the string is not empty.\n\n2. Count the number of a's, b's, c's.\n\n3. If a_count <1 or b_count <1 or c_count <1: output NO.\n\n4. Check the order is a's followed by b's followed by c's.\n\n5. If the order is correct, then check whether c_count equals a_count or b_count.\n\n6. If all conditions are met, output YES; else, NO.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc'\n\na_count = 3, b_count=1, c_count=3.\n\nCheck order: starts with a, then b, then c. Correct.\n\nc_count is 3, which equals a_count. So YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc'\n\nThe string is 'bbacc'.\n\nSo the first two characters are b's. So when the first 'a' appears, it's after b's, which is invalid. So the order check fails, output NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc'\n\nWait, no, the sample input is ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'], but the outputs are [YES, NO, YES]. So the third example is 'aabc'.\n\nWait, no. Let's see the third example: 'aabc'.\n\nWait, no, the third input is 'aabc'? Or maybe it's 'aabc'?\n\nWait, perhaps the third input is 'aabc' — wait, no. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nWait, in the sample input section, the input is ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'], and the outputs are [YES, NO, YES].\n\nSo for the third input, 'aabc':\n\nLet's process it.\n\na_count is 2, b_count is 1, c_count is 1.\n\nOrder check:\n\nFirst character is 'a' — good. Second is 'a' — still good. Third is 'b' — now state changes to 'b'. Fourth is 'c' — state changes to 'c'. So order is correct.\n\nc_count is 1. Now, does 1 equal a_count (2) or b_count (1)? Yes, because it's equal to b_count. So condition satisfied. So output YES.\n\nSo the logic works for these samples.\n\nAnother test case: 'abba' — the order is a's, then b's, then a's — invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' — a_count=1, b_count=1, c_count=1. Order correct. c_count is 1, which equals a_count and b_count. So yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaaccc' — after a's comes b's, then a's again — invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbc' — order is a's, then b's, then c's. a_count=2, b_count=2, c_count=1.\n\nc_count is 1, which is not equal to a_count (2) nor b_count (2). So condition fails. Output NO.\n\nWait, but the c_count is 1, which is less than both a and b. So it's invalid.\n\nSo the plan seems solid.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase where a_count is 1, b_count is 1, c_count is 1 — valid.\n\nCase where a_count is 5, b_count is 3, c_count is 3 — valid because c equals b.\n\nCase where a_count is 5, b_count is 3, c_count is 5 — valid because c equals a.\n\nCase where a_count is 0 — invalid.\n\nCase where c_count is 0 — invalid.\n\nWhat about a string with just a single 'a' — but then no b or c? Then invalid.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' — a_count=1, b_count=3, c_count=1. So c_count is 1, which is not equal to a_count (1) or b_count (3). Wait, 1 equals a_count. So it's valid.\n\nYes, because c_count is 1, which equals a_count.\n\nSo the logic handles that.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nFirst, read the input string.\n\nThen, count the a's, b's, c's.\n\nCheck that a, b, c counts are at least 1.\n\nThen, check the order.\n\nTo check the order, I can iterate through each character and track the current phase.\n\nInitialize phase as 0 (a's), then phase 1 (b's), then phase 2 (c's).\n\nOnce a phase increases, you can't go back.\n\nSo:\n\nphase = 0 (expecting a)\nfor char in S:\n    if phase == 0:\n        if char == 'a':\n            continue\n        elif char == 'b':\n            phase = 1\n        else:\n            # char is 'c' — invalid\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit\n    elif phase == 1:\n        if char == 'b':\n            continue\n        elif char == 'c':\n            phase = 2\n        else:\n            # char is 'a' — invalid\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit\n    elif phase == 2:\n        if char != 'c':\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit\nSo after processing all characters, if phase is 0 or 1, that's invalid because there should be c's at the end.\n\nWait, no. Because in the problem, C appends some 'c's, so the string must end with 'c's. So phase should reach 2.\n\nThus, after processing all characters, phase must be 2.\n\nSo, during iteration, any invalid transition leads to output NO.\n\nSo, let's write code for this.\n\nIn Python:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\ncount_b = s.count('b')\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nif count_a ==0 or count_b ==0 or count_c ==0:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nphase = 0\nfor char in s:\n    if phase == 0:\n        if char == 'a':\n            continue\n        elif char == 'b':\n            phase = 1\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n    elif phase ==1:\n        if char == 'b':\n            continue\n        elif char == 'c':\n            phase = 2\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n    elif phase ==2:\n        if char != 'c':\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n\nif phase !=2:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Now check count_c is equal to count_a or count_b\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what if the string ends in phase 1? Like 'aabbb' — then phase is 1 after processing, which is invalid because C appends some 'c's. So in that case, the string must end with c's, so phase must be 2.\n\nSo after the loop, if phase is not 2, it's invalid.\n\nSo in the code, after the loop, if phase !=2, output NO.\n\nElse, proceed to check if count_c equals a or b.\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n\nLet me test this logic against some test cases.\n\nTest case 1: 'aaabccc' → a=3, b=1, c=3.\n\nPhase starts as 0. All a's until 'b' comes, phase becomes 1. Then 'c's, phase becomes 2. Loop ends. Phase is 2.\n\ncount_c is 3, which equals a's count (3). So output YES.\n\nTest case 2: 'bbacc' → first two are b's. So phase starts at 0, first char is 'b' → phase becomes 1. Next char is 'b' → continue. Next char is 'a' → phase is 1, expecting b or c. 'a' is invalid → output NO.\n\nTest case 3: 'aabc' → a_count=2, b_count=1, c_count=1.\n\nProcessing:\n\nchar 'a' → phase 0.\n\nchar 'a' → continue.\n\nchar 'b' → phase becomes 1.\n\nchar 'c' → phase becomes 2.\n\nAll processed. Phase is 2.\n\ncount_c is 1, which is equal to b_count (1). So output YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → a=1, b=1, c=1.\n\nPhase goes 0→1→2. count_c=1 equals a and b. So YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'abba' → after a's, comes 'b's, then 'a's again. So in phase 1, encounter 'a' → invalid. Output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaaccc' → after a's, then b's, then a's again. So invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbc' → a=2, b=2, c=1.\n\nPhase: 0→1 (after first 'b') → then 'b' again. Then 'c' → phase 2.\n\ncount_c is 1. Is it equal to a (2) or b (2)? No. So output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'abbbc' → a=1, b=3, c=1.\n\ncount_c is 1, which equals a. So YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabb' → no c's → count_c=0 → invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'ab' → no c's → invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'ac' → order invalid, because after a's comes c → invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'cba' → first character is 'c', which is invalid in phase 0.\n\nAnother test case: 'abccc' → a=1, b=1, c=3.\n\ncount_c=3, which equals a (1) no, but equals b (1) no? Wait, wait: count_c is 3, which is not equal to a (1) or b (1). So output NO.\n\nWait, no. Because C appends c's equal to a's or b's. So in this case, a=1, b=1, c=3. So c's count is 3, which is larger than both a and b. So it's invalid.\n\nSo the code correctly outputs NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaabbbccc' → a=3, b=3, c=3. So c can be equal to a and b. So output YES.\n\nI think this covers all the cases.\n\nSo, the code should work correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by three friends appending specific characters in a specific order. The string must start with 'a's, followed by 'b's, and end with 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must equal the number of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Presence of Each Character**: Ensure the string contains at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. If any of these are missing, the string is invalid.\n2. **Check Order of Characters**: The string must strictly follow the order 'a' -> 'b' -> 'c'. We can track the current phase of the string (expecting 'a', 'b', or 'c') and transition through these phases as we iterate through the string.\n3. **Count Validation**: After ensuring the correct order, check if the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\ncount_b = s.count('b')\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nif count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nphase = 0  # 0: expecting a, 1: expecting b, 2: expecting c\n\nfor char in s:\n    if phase == 0:\n        if char == 'a':\n            continue\n        elif char == 'b':\n            phase = 1\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n    elif phase == 1:\n        if char == 'b':\n            continue\n        elif char == 'c':\n            phase = 2\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n    elif phase == 2:\n        if char != 'c':\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n\nif phase != 2:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Character Presence Check**: The code first counts the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c'. If any of these counts are zero, it immediately prints \"NO\" and exits.\n2. **Order Check**: Using a phase system, the code ensures that the string follows the correct sequence. It transitions from expecting 'a' to 'b' and finally to 'c', checking each character against the current phase.\n3. **Final Count Check**: After validating the order, the code checks if the number of 'c's matches the number of 'a's or 'b's. If so, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures the string meets the specified criteria.",
