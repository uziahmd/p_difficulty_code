The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$. Print the number of such pairs modulo $$$mod$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lex smaller than q, and the number of inversions in p is greater than in q. And then output this count modulo a given mod value.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. The constraints are n up to 500, which isn't too bad, but I need an efficient solution. Let's start by understanding what's required.\n\nFirst, inversions: for each permutation, I can calculate the number of inversions. Then, for each pair (p, q), I check two conditions: lex order and inversion count.\n\nWait, but checking all possible pairs is O(n!^2), which is completely impossible for n=500. So I need a smarter way.\n\nSo, the brute force approach is out of the question. I need to find a mathematical model or dynamic programming approach that can compute the required count without enumerating all pairs.\n\nLet me consider the properties of permutations. For two permutations p and q, p being lex smaller means that at the first position where they differ, p has a smaller element than q.\n\nI recall that the total number of pairs where p is lex smaller than q is equal to (n! / 2) * (n! - 1) / 2, but wait no. Wait, for all possible pairs (p, q), exactly half are lex ordered if we consider p < q. Because for any two distinct permutations, one is lex smaller than the other. So the total number of such pairs is (n! * (n! - 1)) ) / 2.\n\nBut here, we have an additional condition on the inversion counts. So from all these lex-smaller pairs, I need to count those where inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to model this as a DP over the permutations, keeping track of certain parameters.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the state as the current position, and some information about the permutation built so far, along with the number of inversions and some other criteria. But even that seems challenging.\n\nAnother angle: Since both p and q are permutations, their inversion counts can vary. Maybe I can precompute for all possible permutations their inversion counts and then find a way to count the valid pairs.\n\nBut even that would require O(n!^2) operations, which is impossible for n=500. So that's not feasible.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a way to express the total count in terms of the sum over all possible pairs (p, q) where p < q lex, and inv(p) > inv(q). So I need to find the sum over all such pairs.\n\nWait, but how can I model this without enumerating all pairs?\n\nLet me think about the problem differently. For each permutation p, how many q's are there such that:\n\n1. q is a permutation.\n2. p < q lex.\n3. inv(q) < inv(p).\n\nIf I can compute, for each p, the number of such q's, then the total sum is the sum over all p of that count.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to, for each permutation p, find the number of q's that satisfy the two conditions.\n\nNow, how to compute this for each p efficiently.\n\nHmm, perhaps for each p, I can find all q's that are lex greater than p and have fewer inversions than p.\n\nBut again, for each p, enumerating all q's is not feasible. So I need a way to represent this for all p's in a way that can be computed efficiently.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's consider all possible pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). The total count is the sum over all p of the number of q's that are lex larger than p and have inv(q) < inv(p).\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, maybe we can separate the problem into two parts: the lex order and the inversion count. Let's think about the lex order first.\n\nWhen comparing two permutations p and q, p is lex smaller if at the first differing position i, p[i] < q[i]. The rest of the elements after i don't matter for the lex order.\n\nNow, the inversion count depends on all pairs of elements in the permutation.\n\nPerhaps the key is to model the problem using dynamic programming, considering the permutations in lex order and tracking certain properties.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model the problem by building the permutations step by step, keeping track of certain state variables. Let's think of building p and q character by character, ensuring that p is lex smaller than q, and keeping track of their inversion counts.\n\nBut that might get complicated because the inversion count depends on all previous choices. Hmm.\n\nWait, another thought: The inversion count of a permutation is equal to the number of inversions contributed by each element as we add them one by one. So, perhaps,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lexicographically smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than the number of inversions in q. The result should be returned modulo a given value.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be approached using dynamic programming (DP) with state tracking. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Understanding Lexicographical Order**: For two permutations p and q, p is considered lexicographically smaller than q if at the first position where they differ, p has a smaller element than q.\n\n2. **Inversion Count**: The number of inversions in a permutation is the count of pairs (i, j) such that i < j and p[i] > p[j].\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming State**: We use a DP approach where `dp[i][k][c]` represents the number of ways to build the first i elements of a permutation, with k inversions, where `c` is a bitmask representing the set of used elements.\n\n4. **Transition Between States**: For each position, we consider all possible next elements that haven't been used yet. We update the inversion count and track the lexicographical order by ensuring that the next element is chosen appropriately.\n\n5. **Combining Results**: After building all possible permutations, we combine the results from both permutations p and q to count valid pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    n, mod = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    max_inv = n * (n - 1) // 2\n    dp_p = [[0] * (max_inv + 1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    dp_q = [[0] * (max_inv + 1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    \n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for k in range(max_inv + 1):\n            dp_p[i][k] = 0\n            for bits in range(1 << (n - i + 1)):\n                if bin(bits).count('1') != n - i + 1:\n                    continue\n                s = 0\n                cnt = 0\n                used = []\n                for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):\n                    if (bits >> (n - j - 1)) & 1:\n                        used.append(j+1)\n                        cnt += sum(used[m] - m-1 for m in range(len(used)) if len(used) > m)\n                if cnt > k:\n                    continue\n                dp_p[i][cnt] += dp_p[i-1][k - cnt]\n                dp_p[i][cnt] %= mod\n    \n    total_p = 0\n    for k in range(max_inv + 1):\n        total_p = (total_p + dp_p[n][k]) % mod\n    \n    dp_p_total = total_p\n    \n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for k in range(max_inv + 1):\n            dp_q[i][k] = 0\n            for bits in range(1 << (n - i + 1)):\n                if bin(bits).count('1') != n - i + 1:\n                    continue\n                s = 0\n                cnt = 0\n                used = []\n                for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):\n                    if (bits >> (n - j - 1)) & 1:\n                        used.append(j+1)\n                        cnt += sum(used[m] - m-1 for m in range(len(used)) if len(used) > m)\n                if cnt > k:\n                    continue\n                dp_q[i][cnt] = (dp_q[i][cnt] + dp_q[i-1][k - cnt]) % mod\n    \n    total_q = 0\n    for k in range(max_inv + 1):\n        total_q = (total_q + dp_q[n][k]) % mod\n    \n    ans = 0\n    for k_p in range(max_inv + 1):\n        for k_q in range(k_p - 1, -1, -1):\n            ans = (ans + dp_p_total[k_p] * dp_q_total[k_q]) % mod\n    \n    print(ans % mod)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution involves two main parts: one for counting the number of valid permutations p and another for q, considering their inversion counts.
