    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem says that Valera has an array a of n integers. He also has a function f(x) which is calculated using the bits of x. The function f(x) is the sum of a_i for all i where the i-th bit in x is 1. For example, if x is 11 (which is 1011 in binary), then the bits set are at positions 0, 1, and 3 (assuming 0-based indexing). So f(11) would be a0 + a1 + a3.\n\nThe task is to find the maximum value of f(x) among all x such that 0 ≤ x ≤ m. But wait, how is m represented? Oh right, the third input line gives the binary representation of m as a string s0s1...sn-1. So for example, if the string is '11010', then m is 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^1 = 16 +8 +2=26.\n\nHmm, but wait, wait. Wait, the way the function f is defined, each a_i is added only if the i-th bit is set in x. So for each x, f(x) is the sum of a subset of the a's, specifically those corresponding to the set bits in x.\n\nSo the problem reduces to selecting a subset of the a's such that the sum is as large as possible, and the corresponding x (the OR of the selected a's' bits) is less than or equal to m.\n\nWait, not exactly. Because the a's may have their own bits set. For instance, if a certain a_i has bits beyond its index, then including it in the subset would set those higher bits, which might make x exceed m.\n\nSo the approach here is to model this as a bitmask problem, where we need to choose a subset of the a's, but with the constraint that when you OR all their bits together, the result is <= m.\n\nBut considering all subsets is computationally expensive, especially since n can be up to 105. That's way too big for brute force.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the problem.\n\nEach a_i contributes to f(x) if and only if the i-th bit is set in x. So the function f(x) is essentially the sum of a_i for each bit i set in x.\n\nSo for any x, f(x) is determined by which a_i's have their i-th bits set in x.\n\nNow, the goal is to find x in [0, m] such that f(x) is maximized.\n\nBut x is constrained by m. So we need to find the x with the highest possible sum of a_i's where x doesn't exceed m.\n\nAn alternative approach: the maximum f(x) will be achieved when x includes as many high a_i's as possible, without exceeding m.\n\nWait, but a_i's can have varying bits. For example, a_i could have higher bits set beyond i. So including a_i might cause x to have bits higher than i, which could exceed m.\n\nSo perhaps the way to model this is as a dynamic programming problem, where for each bit position, we decide whether to include a_i or not, based on whether including it keeps x within the allowed range.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to represent x as a bitmask and find the subset of a_i's whose combined OR is <= m, maximizing the sum of their a_i's.\n\nBut again, with n up to 105, trying all possible subsets is impossible.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, but the a_i's can be processed in a way similar to the knapsack problem. Each a_i can be thought of as an item that adds a certain value (its a_i) and requires certain bits to be set in x (as per the bits in a_i). But the constraint is that the resulting x must be <= m.\n\nSo the problem becomes similar to a knapsack where each item is a_i, and choosing to take it contributes a_i to the total, but also sets certain bits in the current state (x). The state needs to track the current x, ensuring it's <= m.\n\nBut the state space would be too large because m can be up to something like 2^105, which is way too big.\n\nSo perhaps we need a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to realize that each a_i contributes a certain value to f(x) and a certain bitmask to x. So for each a_i, including it adds a_i to the sum and sets the bits in its binary representation into x.\n\nBut the sum is additive, and the x is the OR of all the a_i's included. So the problem is to select a subset S of the a_i's such that the OR of all elements in S is <= m, and the sum of a_i for i in S is maximized.\n\nThis seems like a variation of the knapsack problem, but with the twist that the selection of items affects the constraints in a bitwise manner.\n\nSo perhaps a dynamic programming approach can be used, where the state is the current OR value, and for each a_i, we decide whether to include it or not, updating the OR accordingly.\n\nBut the issue is that the OR can be up to m, which is up to 2^105, making the DP state size impossible.\n\nWait, but wait: the maximum possible OR is m. So the state can be the current OR value, which can't exceed m. That's manageable if m is not too big, but with m being up to 2^105, it's still impossible.\n\nSo that approach won't work.\n\nAlternative idea: the maximum x is m, so any x beyond m is invalid. So perhaps the optimal x is either m itself or a number less than m, but as close to m as possible.\n\nBut even that doesn't directly help.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Since the function f(x) is the sum of a subset of a_i's, perhaps the maximum f(x) is the sum of all a_i's, provided that their combined OR is <= m.\n\nIf that's the case, then the maximum is simply the sum of all a_i's where the OR of all a_i's is <= m. Otherwise, we need to find a subset that doesn't exceed m.\n\nBut what if the OR of all a_i's is larger than m? Then we can't include all a_i's. So in that case, we need to find the subset with maximum sum whose OR is <= m.\n\nSo the first step is to compute the OR of all a_i's. If that OR is <= m, then the answer is the sum of all a_i's.\n\nOtherwise, we need to find the maximum subset sum where the OR of the subset is <= m.\n\nSo the problem breaks down into two cases:\n\n1. The OR of all a_i's is <= m → sum all a_i.\n2. Else → find the subset with maximum sum, OR <= m.\n\nSo how do we handle the second case?\n\nThis seems tricky. Because the OR of the subset can't exceed m, and we need to maximize the sum.\n\nWait, but the a_i's can have various bits. So perhaps the maximum sum is achieved by selecting a subset of a_i's that collectively set certain bits, without any higher bits than m.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: since the OR of the subset must be <= m, the subset can't have any bits set that are set in m.\n\nWait no, because m can have certain bits set. For example, if m is 5 (101), then the subset can have bits set only in positions 0 and 2 (since 5 allows those). Or wait, no: 5 in binary is 101, so the bits allowed are 0 and 2, but any subset with bits in these positions can be ORed together as long as the result is <=5.\n\nWait, but 101 OR 001 is 101, which is okay. 101 OR 010 is 111, which is 7>5, so that's not allowed.\n\nSo the subset's OR must be <=m.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution involves greedily selecting the a_i's that contribute the most to the sum, provided their inclusion doesn't cause the OR to exceed m.\n\nBut that might not always work because some a_i's have multiple bits set, which might prevent other a_i's from being included.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a binary decision for each a_i: include it or not, and track the current OR and the sum.\n\nBut with n=105, this approach is feasible if the number of possible OR values is manageable.\n\nWait, but the OR can only increase as we add more a_i's. So for each a_i, the new OR is the previous OR OR'ed with a_i's bits. So each step can only keep the same OR or increase it.\n\nSo the possible states are the possible OR values after including some subset of a_i's. And each time we process an a_i, for each existing state, we can choose to include it, leading to a new state (OR state | a_i's bits) or not include it.\n\nThe maximum sum for each OR state can be tracked.\n\nSo the initial state is 0 with sum 0.\n\nFor each a_i, for each existing state (current_or, current_sum), we can create a new state (current_or | a_i_bits, current_sum + a_i) if current_or | a_i_bits <= m.\n\nWe can represent this as a DP table, where dp[or_mask] represents the maximum sum achievable with that or_mask.\n\nBut the problem is that the number of possible OR masks can be up to 2^n, which is way too big for n=105.\n\nWait, but in practice, the OR can only go up to m. So the maximum possible OR is m, so the number of possible OR states is m's bit length plus one, which is up to 106 for m up to 2^105.\n\nWait, but 2^105 is way too big—like 40 bits, so 2^40 is about a trillion. So that's not feasible.\n\nSo this approach is not feasible for n=105.\n\nHmm, so what else can be done?\n\nAlternative idea: the maximum sum is achieved by selecting a subset of a_i's such that the OR of the subset is as large as possible without exceeding m. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is the sum of all a_i's where each a_i's bits are a subset of m's bits. Because if an a_i has a bit set that's not set in m, then including it would set that bit in x, making x larger than m. Which is invalid.\n\nSo the first thing to check is: for each a_i, does a_i & (~m) == 0? If yes, then including it is safe. Otherwise, including it would set some bit that's not in m, making x exceed m.\n\nWait, because m is a certain binary number. So any a_i that has a bit set outside the bits set in m cannot be included. Because including it would set that bit in x, making x > m.\n\nSo for each a_i, check whether a_i & ~m is zero. If not, then including it is forbidden because x would exceed m.\n\nThus, the first step is to filter out any a_i's that have bits set outside of m.\n\nBecause including them would make x exceed m.\n\nSo the modified a array consists only of a_i's where a_i | m == m, i.e., a_i & ~m == 0.\n\nWait, no: a_i | m is m if a_i's bits are a subset of m's. So for a_i to be includable, a_i must be a subset of m's bits.\n\nSo for each a_i, if (a_i & ~m) != 0 → can't include it.\n\nSo the first thing to do is to filter out any a_i that has bits not present in m.\n\nOnce we have this filtered list, then the maximum sum is simply the sum of all remaining a_i's, because their OR is a subset of m's bits, so the OR of the entire set is <= m.\n\nBecause when you OR all the a_i's that are subsets of m, the result is also a subset of m.\n\nSo in this case, the maximum f(x) is the sum of all a_i's that are subsets of m.\n\nBut wait, what if m is such that including all a_i's that are subsets of m results in an OR that is less than or equal to m?\n\nYes, because each a_i's bits are subsets of m's, so their OR is also a subset of m's. So the OR is <= m.\n\nSo this suggests that the solution is:\n\n1. Compute m from the given binary string.\n\n2. For each a_i, check if (a_i & ~m) == 0. If yes, include it. Else, exclude it.\n\n3. Sum all the included a_i's. That's the maximum possible f(x).\n\nBecause including all such a_i's ensures that x (the OR) is <= m, and the sum is maximized.\n\nIs this correct?\n\nLet me test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=2\n\na = [3,8]\n\nbinary string is '10' → which is 2.\n\nWait, wait, the third line is '10', which is 2 in decimal.\n\nWait, but in the note, it says that m=20. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe I misread the input.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the third line is '10'—so m is 2, right? But in the note, m is 20. That seems conflicting.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the sample input is written as ['2\\n3 8\\n10', '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010'].\n\nWait, no, looking back: the sample input in the user message is written as:\n\n['2\\n3 8\\n10', '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010']\n\nWait, perhaps the third line is '10', which is m=2, but in the note, the x is 5, which is 101 in binary, but m is 20+21+23=64+32+16+8+... Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the third line is the binary representation of m, but in the note, m is 20, which is 10100 in binary. So perhaps the third line is '10100' for m=20.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is as follows:\n\nFirst line: 2 → n=2.\n\nSecond line: 3 8 → a0=3, a1=8.\n\nThird line: '10100' → which is 20 in binary.\n\nIn that case, for each a_i, check if a_i & ~m ==0.\n\nm is 20 → binary 10100. So ~m is ...111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111000111.\n\nWait, but for a_i, any bits set beyond the 4th bit (since m is 20, 5 bits) will cause a_i & ~m to be non-zero.\n\nSo for a0=3 → binary 11. It's 2 bits, so it's within m's 5 bits. So a0 & ~m is 0? Let's see: m is 20 → binary 10100. So ~m (assuming 32 bits) is ...111111000111. Wait, but in reality, in Python, integers are of arbitrary length, but for checking, perhaps it's better to compute if a_i's bits are a subset of m's.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to check if (a_i | m) == m. Because if a_i's bits are all set in m, then a_i | m is m.\n\nSo for a_i=3, m=20 (10100). 3 is 11, which is 00011. OR with 10100 gives 10111, which is larger than 20. So 3 is not a subset of m's bits.\n\nWait, so in that case, according to our earlier logic, a_i=3 can't be included because including it would set the lower two bits, which are already set in m. Wait, no, that's not the problem. The problem is that a_i's bits may be outside of m's.\n\nWait, wait, no. For example, if m is 20 (10100), then a_i can have any combination of the bits set in m. So for a_i=3 (00011), the bits are set in positions 0 and 1, which are not set in m (m is 10100, which has bits set in 4 and 2). So including a_i=3 would set bits 0 and 1 in x, which are not set in m. So x would be 10100 | 00011 = 10111 (23), which is larger than m (20). So including a_i=3 is invalid.\n\nSo according to our earlier logic, a_i=3 should be excluded.\n\nBut in the sample note, in the first test case, x is 1, which is 00001. So a0=3 is included, contributing 3 to f(x). But x=1 is less than m=20, but why isn't x allowed to be 3, which would include a0=3 and a1=8, giving x=11, which is 1011, which is less than 20.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=2\n\na = [3,8]\n\nbinary string s is '10' → which is 2 in decimal. But according to the note, m=20.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. So perhaps the sample input is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the third line is the binary representation of m, but the sample input is written in a way that the third line is '10', which is 2, but m is 20. So perhaps the sample is a typo.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third line is a longer string. For example, in the sample input description, it's written as '10' but in the note, m is 20. So perhaps there's a mistake in the sample.\n\nBut regardless, perhaps the initial approach is correct: filter a_i's that are subsets of m's bits, and sum them.\n\nIn the first sample, m is 20 (10100), and a_i's are 3 (00011) and 8 (1000). \n\nCheck for a0=3: 3 in binary is 00011. m is 10100. So a0's bits are not a subset of m's bits. Because a0 has bits set in positions 0 and 1, which are not set in m.\n\nSimilarly, a1=8 is 1000, which is 8. m is 20 (10100). 8's bits are set in position 3, which is not set in m (since m is 10100 → positions 4, 2). So a1=8 also can't be included.\n\nSo according to this, the sum is 0.\n\nBut according to the note, the maximum f(x) is 3, which is achieved by x=1.\n\nBut x=1 is 00001, which is a subset of m's bits. So a0=3 can't be included because its bits are not a subset of m's. So how is it possible?\n\nAh, wait, I think I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Because a_i's bits are not necessarily a subset of m's bits. They can be any bits, but including a_i would set those bits in x. So x can be any number up to m, but including a_i's bits may cause x to exceed m.\n\nWait, but if a_i's bits are a subset of m's bits, then including a_i will not set any bits beyond those in m. So including such a_i's is safe.\n\nBut if a_i has any bits set that are not set in m, then including it would set those bits in x, making x larger than m. So including such a_i's is not allowed.\n\nSo the correct approach is to include all a_i's that are subsets of m's bits.\n\nSo in the first sample, m is 20 (10100), a_i=3 is 00011, which is not a subset. So it can't be included.\n\nBut according to the note, x=1 is allowed, which includes a0=3, but how? Because a0=3's bits are not a subset of m's.\n\nWait, that suggests that my initial approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, now I'm really stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the condition is x ≤ m, not the bits of x.\n\nSo including a_i's can set bits beyond those in m, as long as the overall x is ≤ m.\n\nSo the condition is x ≤ m, not that the bits of a_i are subsets of m's bits.\n\nSo the earlier approach was incorrect.\n\nSo the problem is not that a_i's bits must be subsets of m's bits, but rather that when you include a_i, it may set some bits beyond m's bits, but the overall x (the OR of all included a_i's) must be ≤ m.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample, including a0=3 (binary 11) and a1=8 (binary 1000) gives x= 1011 (11), which is less than m=20. So that's allowed.\n\nSo the condition is not about a_i's bits, but about the OR of the included a_i's.\n\nSo the approach must consider the OR of the selected a_i's, ensuring it's ≤ m.\n\nSo the problem is to find a subset S of a_i's such that the OR of all elements in S is ≤ m, and the sum of a_i for i in S is maximized.\n\nThis changes everything.\n\nSo the initial approach is incorrect; the a_i's can have bits beyond those in m, but as long as their inclusion doesn't cause the overall OR to exceed m.\n\nSo the problem is more complex.\n\nSo how do we model this?\n\nWe can model it with a dynamic programming approach where the state is the current OR value, and for each a_i, we can choose to include it or not, updating the OR accordingly.\n\nThe DP state will track the maximum sum achievable for each possible OR value up to m.\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n\n1. Convert the binary string s into the integer m.\n\n2. Initialize a DP dictionary where the key is the OR value, and the value is the maximum sum achievable for that OR. Initially, the DP contains {0:0}.\n\n3. For each a_i in the array:\n   a. For each existing state in DP:\n      i. Compute the new_or = current_or | a_i.\n      ii. If new_or > m, skip this state.\n      iii. Else, update the DP to keep the maximum sum for new_or.\n   \n4. After processing all a_i's, the maximum value in the DP is the answer.\n\nBut wait, with n=105 and m up to 2^105, the DP state space can be very large. However, in practice, for each a_i, the number of possible OR values increases, but for m up to 1e18 or similar, the number of OR values is manageable because OR operations can't decrease the number of set bits. So the number of distinct OR values is O(m), but for m up to 2^20, it's manageable.\n\nWait, but m can be up to 2^105, which is way too big for a DP approach.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the sample input's m is 20, but perhaps in the actual problem, m can be up to 2^20 or something manageable.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that n can be up to 105, but it doesn't specify m's upper limit. So for code submission, the approach must handle m up to 2^105, which is impossible for a DP approach.\n\nSo this suggests that the initial approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the OR operation is monotonic, once a certain OR value is reached, adding more a_i's can only keep the OR the same or increase it. So the DP can be optimized by storing only the OR values that are achievable and their maximum sums.\n\nMoreover, for each a_i, the number of new OR states is limited by the number of bits in m.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent the DP as a set of reachable OR values and their maximum sums, updating them as we process each a_i.\n\nSo let's proceed with this approach.\n\nInitialize the DP as a dictionary: dp = {0:0}.\n\nFor each a in a_list:\n    new_dp = {}\n    for or_val in dp:\n        current_sum = dp[or_val]\n        # Case 1: not include a\n        if or_val in new_dp:\n            if current_sum > new_dp[or_val]:\n                new_dp[or_val] = current_sum\n        else:\n            new_dp[or_val] = current_sum\n        # Case 2: include a\n        new_or = or_val | a\n        if new_or > m:\n            continue\n        if new_or in new_dp:\n            if current_sum + a > new_dp[new_or]:\n                new_dp[new_or] = current_sum + a\n        else:\n            new_dp[new_or] = current_sum + a\n    # Now, merge new_dp into dp, keeping the maximum sum for each or_val\n    # To do this, for each or_val in new_dp, if it's not in dp or has a higher sum, update it\n    for or_val in new_dp:\n        if or_val in dp:\n            if new_dp[or_val] > dp[or_val]:\n                dp[or_val] = new_dp[or_val]\n        else:\n            dp[or_val] = new_dp[or_val]\n\nAfter processing all a_i's, the maximum value in dp.values() is the answer.\n\nBut with n=105 and m up to 2^105, the number of OR states can be very large, potentially up to 2^105, which is impossible.\n\nWait, but in practice, the number of OR states grows polynomially with the number of bits in m. Because each OR operation can only add bits, not remove them. So the maximum number of OR states is O(2^k), where k is the number of bits in m.\n\nFor example, if m is 20 (binary 10100, 5 bits), then the maximum number of OR states is 2^5=32. So for m up to 1e18, which is about 60 bits, the number of OR states is 2^60, which is way too big.\n\nSo this approach is feasible only if m is small.\n\nBut in the problem statement, there is no restriction on m's size. So for the code submission, this approach may not be feasible for large m.\n\nSo we need a different approach.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the OR is a monotonically increasing operation, perhaps we can find a way to represent the possible OR values efficiently.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: The maximum possible f(x) is the sum of all a_i's, provided that the OR of all a_i's is <= m.\n\nIf the OR of all a_i's is <= m, then the answer is the sum of all a_i's.\n\nOtherwise, the problem is to find a subset of a_i's whose OR is <= m, with maximum sum.\n\nSo first, compute the OR of all a_i's. If this OR is <= m, then the answer is the sum of all a_i's.\n\nElse, find the maximum subset sum with OR <= m.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nif total_or <= m:\n    return sum(a)\nelse:\n    find max subset sum with OR <= m.\n\nNow, the question is: How to find the maximum subset sum where the OR is <= m.\n\nBut again, for n=105, this is challenging.\n\nWait, but the maximum subset sum is the sum of all a_i's whose inclusion doesn't cause the OR to exceed m.\n\nBut finding such a subset is similar to a knapsack problem with constraints on the OR value.\n\nAn alternative approach is to use a bitmask-based dynamic programming, but optimize it by noting that the OR can only increase, and for each a_i, the new OR can be built from the previous ORs.\n\nBut for n=105, even with m up to 2^20, it's manageable.\n\nWait, but if m is up to 2^105, which is 40 bits, it's impossible.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects us to implement this DP approach, assuming that m is manageable.\n\nSo let's proceed under the assumption that m is manageable, say up to 2^20, and implement the DP approach.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read n, a list, and m.\n\n- Compute the total_or of all a_i's. If total_or <= m, output sum(a).\n\n- Else, perform the DP approach to find the maximum subset sum with OR <= m.\n\nSo let's try to implement this.\n\nBut how to compute m from the binary string?\n\nIn Python, we can read the binary string and convert it into an integer.\n\nNow, let's outline the code steps.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the a list as integers.\n\nRead the binary string s.\n\nCompute m = int(s, 2).\n\nCompute total_or = OR of all a_i's.\n\nIf total_or <= m → print sum(a).\n\nElse:\n\nProceed with the DP approach.\n\nInitialize dp as a dictionary {0:0}.\n\nFor each a in a_list:\n\n    Create a temporary dictionary to store new states.\n\n    For each current_or in dp:\n\n        current_sum = dp[current_or]\n\n        // Option 1: don't include a → current_or remains.\n\n        if current_or not in new_dp or current_sum > new_dp[current_or]:\n            new_dp[current_or] = current_sum\n\n        // Option 2: include a → new_or = current_or | a.\n\n        new_or = current_or | a\n\n        if new_or > m:\n            continue\n\n        // Update new_dp with new_or and current_sum + a.\n\n        if new_or not in new_dp or (current_sum + a) > new_dp[new_or]:\n            new_dp[new_or] = current_sum + a\n\n    // Now, merge new_dp into dp, taking the maximum sum for each OR.\n\n    for or_val in new_dp:\n        if or_val not in dp or new_dp[or_val] > dp[or_val]:\n            dp[or_val] = new_dp[or_val]\n\nAfter processing all a's, find the maximum value in dp.values().\n\nPrint that value.\n\nBut wait, in the code, when creating new_dp, we have to consider that each a can be added to any existing state, and then merged into dp.\n\nBut the way to handle it is, for each a, for each existing state, generate new states by including a, and then merge the new states into dp, keeping the maximum sum for each OR.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this approach on the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=2\n\na = [3,8]\n\nm is 20 (binary 10100).\n\ntotal_or = 3 |8 = 11, which is <=20. So the answer is 3+8=11.\n\nBut according to the note, the maximum is 3. So something's wrong.\n\nWait, wait, that contradicts the note.\n\nIn the note, the maximum f(x) is 27, but according to the initial approach, the total_or is 11, which is <=20, so the sum is 11.\n\nWait, perhaps the note is referring to a different scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nn=5\n\na = [17,0,10,2,1]\n\nm=20+21+23=64 → binary 100000.\n\nNo, perhaps I'm getting the samples mixed up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nn=5\n\na = [17,0,10,2,1]\n\nm=11010 → which is 26.\n\nWait, 11010 is 16 +8 + 2 = 26.\n\nThen, the total_or is 17 |0 |10|2|1 = 19, which is <=26. So the sum is 17+0+10+2+1=30.\n\nBut the note says the maximum is 27.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting the samples wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nn=5\n\na = [17,0,10,2,1]\n\nm=26 (binary 11010).\n\nIn this case, the total_or is 17 |10 |2 |1 = 19 (17 is 10001, 10 is 1010, 2 is 10, 1 is 1. OR is 11111=31, which is larger than 26.\n\nSo the DP approach is needed.\n\nSo the maximum subset sum is 17+10+2+1=30? Or perhaps not.\n\nWait, no. Let's compute:\n\nIncluding 17 (10001), 10 (1010), 2 (10), 1 (1).\n\nThe OR of 17, 10 is 10001 | 01010 = 11011 (27).\n\nWhich is larger than 26, so can't include both.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal subset is 17, 10, and 2.\n\n17 |10 |2 = 10001 | 01010 = 11011 (27) | 10 → 11011 | 10 = 11111 (31>26).\n\nSo including 17 and 10 is not allowed.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal is to include 17, 2, and 1.\n\n17 |2 |1= 17 |3= 19.\n\n19 <=26. Sum is 17+2+1=20.\n\nOr perhaps include 10, 2, 1 → sum is 13, OR is 10 |2 |1= 11.\n\nBut 17+10=27, but their OR is 27>26.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum is 10+2+1=13, but that's worse.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum is 17+10=27, but their OR is 27>26. So can't include both.\n\nSo what's the best subset?\n\nWhat's the maximum sum possible with OR <=26.\n\nLooking for the best sum.\n\nPossible options:\n\n- 17 alone: sum 17.\n\n- 10, 2, 1: sum 13.\n\n- 17, 2, 1: sum 20.\n\n- 10, 2: sum 12.\n\n- 10, 2, 1: sum 13.\n\n- 17, 2: sum 19.\n\n- 17, 2, 1: sum 20.\n\n- 10, 2,1: sum 13.\n\n- 17, 10: sum 27 but OR 27>26.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum is 20.\n\nBut according to the note, the maximum is 27.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the note says that in the second sample, m is 20+21+23=11.\n\nWait, that's 64+32+16+8+1=121?\n\nNo, 20+21+23= 20+21=41+23=64.\n\nWait, 20 is 10100, 21 is 10101, 23 is 10111.\n\nOR of 20,21,23 is 10111 (23).\n\nWhich is 23 < m.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is referring to a different scenario.\n\nRegardless, perhaps the code will correctly handle the sample.\n\nSo, the code plan is:\n\n- Read n.\n\n- Read a as a list of integers.\n\n- Read s, the binary string, compute m = int(s,2).\n\n- Compute total_or = OR of all a_i.\n\n- If total_or <= m → output sum(a).\n\n- Else:\n\n   - Initialize dp = {0:0}.\n\n   - For each a_i in a:\n\n       - Create a new_dp.\n\n       - For each or_val in dp:\n\n           - current_sum = dp[or_val].\n\n           - new_or = or_val | a_i.\n\n           - if new_or > m → skip.\n\n           - else:\n\n               - if new_or is not in new_dp or current_sum + a_i is larger → add to new_dp.\n\n       - Merge new_dp into dp, keeping the maximum sum for each or_val.\n\n   - The maximum value in dp.values() is the answer.\n\nSo, the code should implement this.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nBut wait, for the case where a_i is 0, including it doesn't change the OR, but adds 0 to the sum, which is worse than not including it. So including a_i=0 is not beneficial. So perhaps during the processing, a_i=0 can be skipped.\n\nBut in the code, including a_i=0 will add 0 to the sum, which is the same as not including it. So it's better to skip processing a_i=0.\n\nSo, in the code, perhaps we can skip a_i=0.\n\nSo, in the code, before processing each a_i, if a_i is 0, continue.\n\nThat's an optimization.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nRead n.\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nm = int(s, 2)\n\ntotal_or = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n    total_or |= num\n\nif total_or <= m:\n    print(sum(a))\nelse:\n    dp = {0:0}\n    for num in a:\n        if num == 0:\n            continue\n        new_dp = {}\n        for or_val in dp:\n            current_sum = dp[or_val]\n            # option 1: not include num\n            if or_val in new_dp:\n                if current_sum > new_dp",
