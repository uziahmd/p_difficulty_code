При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a possible error in message transmission between servers. When two identical messages are sent one after another, there might be an error where they merge into one. The way they merge is by overlapping the end of the first and the beginning of the second. But for this overlap to happen, the same number of characters must be present at both ends. Also, the overlapped part has to be a positive length, which means the total length of the resulting message must be less than the sum of the two original messages' lengths minus 1. Wait, no, actually, the example says that when two messages of length n are sent, the result can have a length of n + n - k, where k is the overlap. So for k>0, the total length would be 2n -k. But the key point is that the overlapping part must be a suffix of the first message and a prefix of the second. And both parts must be exactly the same, with length at least 1.\n\nSo the task is: given a string t, determine if it could have resulted from such an error. If yes, output \"YES\" followed by the possible s (the original message). Otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\nHmm. So how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, the problem says that t could be formed by two equal messages s concatenated correctly but merged due to the error. So for t to be a result of such an error, it must be possible to split t into two parts: the first part being s, and the second part being s again, but with some overlap between them.\n\nWait, no. Because when you send two messages, say s and s, the error causes them to merge. So the resulting string is s's suffix concatenated with s's prefix. So the total length is len(s) * 2 - k, where k is the overlap.\n\nSo for a given t, to check if it's a result of such an error, we need to find a possible s and a possible k, such that:\n\nt = s + s' \n\nwhere s' is the second s but with the first k characters replaced by the last k of s.\n\nBut wait, more accurately, when two s's are sent, their concatenation would result in s concatenated with s. But due to the error, the first s's end and the second s's start overlap by k characters. So the resulting t is the first s's end (length k) plus the second s's start (length len(s) -k).\n\nWait, no. Because the first s is sent, then the second s is sent. Due to the error, the two messages are merged. So the first part is the last k characters of the first s, and the second part is the first len(s) -k characters of the second s. But since both are s, the second s is the same as the first, so the merged string becomes s[-k:] + s[ : len(s)-k].\n\nSo t must be equal to s[-k:] + s[: len(s)-k], for some k >=1 and len(t) = len(s)*2 -k.\n\nWait, because len(t) is (len(s) -k) + k = len(s). Wait no: the first s has length L. The second s also has length L. When they are merged, the total length is (L -k) + (L - (L -k)) )? No, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's think about the example given: 'abrakadabra' is sent twice. Suppose the overlap is 4 characters. Then the merged string is 'abradabra' + 'abracadabra'? Wait, no, the example says that when the overlap is 4, the result is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra', which is longer. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood.\n\nWait, the example says that sending two 'abrakadabra's could result in a message like 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' or 'abrakadabrakadabra'. Oh, okay, so the first case is when the two messages are merged by overlapping 1 character. So the result is s + s, but the first character is taken from the end of s, and the next len(s)-1 from the beginning of s again. Or wait, no.\n\nWait, when you have two s's sent, and the error causes them to merge. So the resulting string t is the first s's suffix of length k, followed by the second s's prefix of length (len(s) -k). Since both are s, the resulting t is s[-k:] + s[:-k]. So the total length is len(s) + (len(s) -k) - k? Wait, no, because s[-k:] is k characters, and s[:-k] is len(s)-k. So the total length is k + (len(s) -k) = len(s).\n\nWait, that can't be right because in the example, the result is longer than len(s). For instance, the first example, 'abrakadabra' is length 11. So when two are sent, each is 11. If the overlap is 1, then the merged string is s[-1:] + s[:-1], which is 1 +10=11. But in the example, the result is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is length 21, meaning that the two s's were not properly merged. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, looking back: the example says that when two messages 'abrakadabra' are sent, the result could be 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (overlap of 1) or 'abrakadabrakadabra' (overlap of 4). Wait, that's confusing.\n\nWait, 'abrakadabra' is 11 letters. So if the two messages are sent, and they are merged with an overlap of 1, the result would be the last 1 character of the first message, followed by the rest of the second message (excluding the first 1 character). But since both are 'abrakadabra', that would be 'a' + 'brakadabra' → 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'? Wait, no, because the second message starts with 'abrakadabra'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the process. Let's say s is the original message, sent twice. The first is s, the second is s. When the error occurs, the two messages are merged. So the resulting string t is the first s's suffix (of length k) concatenated with the second s's prefix (of length l), but only if the suffix and prefix are the same, and k + l is equal to the sum of the lengths of s and s, minus k? Or wait, perhaps the overlap is k, meaning that the first s ends with k characters, and the second s starts with k characters, so they overlap completely. So the resulting t is s + s, but with the overlapping part merged.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is: when two s's are sent, the first is s, the second is s. Due to the error, the last k characters of the first s and the first k characters of the second s are merged, so the resulting t is s's (s[0...n-1 -k]) + s's (s[n-k ... n-1]) + s's (s[0...k-1]). Wait, no. Because the first s is sent, then the second s is sent. The error causes the two to be merged by overlapping the end of the first with the start of the second. So the resulting t is the first s's suffix (k chars) plus the second s's prefix (excluding the first k chars). So t = s[-k:] + s[k:]. But since the second s is the same as the first, it's s[-k:] + s[k:], which is the same as s + s, but overlapping by k characters. So the length of t is len(s) + len(s) -k = 2*len(s) -k. But in the example, when s is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters), and k=4, then t is s[-4:] (which is 'dabra') + s[4:] (which is 'raka...'), but wait, the example says that the result is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t is formed by taking the first s and appending the second s, but with the overlapping part merged. So the total length is len(s)*2 -k, and t's length is 2*len(s) -k.\n\nSo for the example where t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 21 letters, and s is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters), 2*11=22. So 21 is 22-1, so k=1. So the merged string is s[-1:] (which is 'a') + s[1:11], which is 'brakadabra', making 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (wait, no, 1+10=11, but 21 is 11*2-1=21. So that makes sense.\n\nWait, but the other possibility in the example is 'abrakadabrakadabra', which is 20 letters. 20= 2*10 -0? Or perhaps k=10, but that would require the entire string to overlap, which is not allowed because the overlapping must be positive.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me restate the problem.\n\nGiven t, can it be written as s + s, but with an overlap of k>0, so that the first k characters of the second s are the same as the last k of the first s. So t is s[-k:] + s[:-k], but since the second s is the same as the first, the merged string is s[-k:] + s[:-k]. The total length of t is len(s) + (len(s) -k) = 2*len(s) -k.\n\nSo for a given t, we can try all possible k values (from 1 to len(t)-1) and see if it can be split into two parts that form s and s with the overlap.\n\nWait, but len(s) is unknown. Hmm. Alternatively, for a given t, the possible s's can be derived by considering all possible splits of t into two parts, with the second part being a prefix of t's suffix.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: for t to be a result of merging two s's with an overlap of k>0, t must be s + s, but with the last k characters of s and the first k characters of s overlapped.\n\nSo for any possible k, where 1 ≤ k < len(s), we can check if t can be split into s1 and s2, where s1 is s's suffix of length k, s2 is s's prefix of length (len(s) -k). But since s1 is s[-k:] and s2 is s[:len(s)-k], then s1 + s2 must equal t.\n\nWait, but len(t) is len(s) + (len(s) -k) = 2*len(s) -k. So len(t) = 2*len(s) -k. Rearranged, len(s) = (len(t)+k)/2.\n\nSince len(s) must be an integer, (len(t)+k) must be even. So k can vary from 1 up to len(t)-1, but with the condition that (len(t)+k) is even, and that len(s) = (len(t)+k)/2 ≥ k (since len(s) must be at least k, because s has a suffix of length k).\n\nSo for each possible k, where 1 ≤ k < len(t), and (len(t)+k) is even, we can compute len(s) = (len(t)+k)/2. Then, check if t can be split into s[-k:] + s[:len(s)-k], which is t.\n\nWait, but s is the original message. So for a given k, we can compute len(s) as (len(t) +k)/2. Then, we can extract s_candidate as the first (len(s)-k) characters of t, and the last k characters of t. Wait, no. Because t is s[-k:] + s[:len(s)-k]. So the first part of t is s[-k:], which is the last k characters of s, and the second part is s[:len(s)-k], which is the first part of t.\n\nSo for a given k, to get s_candidate, we can take the first (len(s)-k) characters of t as the prefix of s, and the last k characters as the suffix of s. So s_candidate must be equal to the prefix part plus the suffix part. Because s is the same as both parts.\n\nWait, for example, suppose t is 'abcdcdab', which is 8 characters. Let's pick k=2. Then len(s) is (8+2)/2=5. So s_candidate is t's first 3 characters ('abc') plus the last 2 ('ab'), making 'abcab'. So s_candidate is 'abcab'. Now, to verify, does t equal s_candidate[-2:] + s_candidate[:5-2]? s_candidate[-2:] is 'ab', and s_candidate[:3] is 'abc', so combined, 'ab'+'abc' is 'abcab', but t is 'abcdcdab'. Wait, that doesn't match. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how s_candidate is constructed. Let's think again.\n\nIf t is s[-k:] + s[:len(s)-k], then len(t) = k + (len(s) -k) = len(s). But earlier, I thought that len(t) is 2*len(s) -k, but that contradicts. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, no. Let me recalculate.\n\nEach s is of length L. The merged t is s's last k characters (length k) plus s's first (L -k) characters (length L -k). So the total length is k + (L -k) = L. But that can't be, because in the example, t is longer than L.\n\nAh, I see! I think I've been misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, it says that the two messages are sent, and the error causes them to merge. So the two messages are s and s, and during transmission, they are merged into t. So t is s followed by s, but with some overlapping.\n\nWait, perhaps the way it works is that the first message is s, the second is s, but during transmission, the two are merged by overlapping k characters. So t is s + s, but with k characters overlapping. So the resulting t is s concatenated with s, but the first k characters of the second s are the same as the last k of the first s.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So t is s + s, but with the first k characters of the second s overlapping the last k of the first s. So t's length is len(s) + len(s) -k = 2*len(s) -k.\n\nIn that case, for the example where s is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters), and k=1, t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (11 +11 -1=21 letters). So the way t is formed is by adding s and s, but the first character of the second s overlaps with the last character of the first s.\n\nSo for a given t, to check if it can be split into s + s with an overlap of k>0, the steps are:\n\n1. Iterate over possible k values, which must satisfy 1 ≤ k < len(t) and (len(t) +k) must be even. Because len(t) = 2*len(s) -k → len(s) = (len(t) +k)/2. So len(s) must be an integer.\n\n2. For each valid k, compute len(s) as (len(t)+k)/2.\n\n3. Check if len(s) is at least k. Because s must have a suffix of length k.\n\n4. Then, split t into two parts: the first part is the first (len(t) -k) characters, and the second part is the last k characters.\n\nWait, no. Because when the messages are merged, the t is s concatenated with s, but with the first k characters of the second s overlapping the last k of the first s. So the t would consist of the first s, and then the second s starting from the k-th character.\n\nSo t is s + s[k:]. So t's length is len(s) + (len(s) -k) = 2*len(s) -k.\n\nThus, for a given k, to construct s, we can take the first (len(t) -k) characters of t as s, and the last k characters of t should match the first k characters of s.\n\nWait, no. Because s is the original message. So in t, the last k characters of s are the first k of the second s.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to reconstruct s is: s must be such that s's suffix of length k equals the prefix of the second s. But since the second s is the same as the first, that suffix of s is equal to the prefix of s.\n\nSo for a given k, the candidate s is the first (len(t) -k) characters of t. Then, we need to check if the last k characters of this candidate s are equal to the first k characters of the candidate s.\n\nBecause t is s + s[k:], which is s followed by s starting from index k. So the entire t is s concatenated with s[k:].\n\nThus, for a given k, to find s_candidate, we can take the first (len(t) -k) characters of t as s_candidate. Then, check if the last k characters of s_candidate are equal to the first k characters of s_candidate.\n\nIf this condition is satisfied, then t is indeed the result of merging two s_candidate messages with an overlap of k. So s_candidate is a possible s.\n\nTherefore, the approach is:\n\nFor each possible k (from 1 to len(t)-1):\n\n   if (len(t) +k) is even:\n\n      len_s = (len(t) +k) // 2\n\n      if len_s < k: continue\n\n      s_candidate = t[0 : len_s -k]\n\n      # now, the last k characters of s_candidate should be equal to the first k characters of s_candidate.\n\n      if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n\n          return YES and s_candidate\n\nIf none of the k's work, output NO.\n\nWait, but wait: len(t) is 2*len_s -k.\n\nSo len(t) = 2*len_s -k → len_s = (len(t)+k)/2.\n\nBut for len_s to be an integer, (len(t)+k) must be even.\n\nSo for each k in 1..(len(t)-1):\n\n   if (len(t) +k) %2 !=0: skip.\n\n   len_s = (len(t)+k)//2.\n\n   if len_s <k: skip.\n\n   s_candidate = t[0 : len_s -k]\n\n   if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n\n       return YES and s_candidate.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: ['abrakadabrabrakadabra']\n\nOutput: 'YES\\nabrakadabra'\n\nLet's compute for this t.\n\nt is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → len(t) =21.\n\nWe need to find k such that (21 +k) is even. So k must be odd.\n\nPossible k: 1,3,...,19.\n\nFor each k, compute len_s=(21 +k)/2.\n\nCheck if len_s >=k.\n\nThen, s_candidate is t[0 : len_s -k].\n\nCheck if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k].\n\nLet's try k=1.\n\nlen_s=(21+1)/2=11.\n\nlen_s=11 >=1.\n\ns_candidate is t[0:11-1=10], which is 'abrakadabr'.\n\nNow, s_candidate[-1:] is 'r', and s_candidate[:1] is 'a'. Not equal. So no.\n\nNext, k=3.\n\nlen_s=(21+3)/2=12.\n\nlen_s=12 >=3.\n\ns_candidate is t[0:12-3=9] → 'abrakadab'.\n\ns_candidate[-3:] is 'dab', s_candidate[:3] is 'abr' → not equal.\n\nk=5: len_s= (21+5)/2=13. s_candidate is t[0:8] → 'abrakada'.\n\nCheck last 5 vs first 5.\n\nLast 5: 'raka' → no, wait, len(t)=21, s_candidate is 8 characters. So s_candidate[-5:] is 'raka' (assuming 8-5=3, so positions 3-7 (0-based)), but wait, 8-5=3, so indices 0-2: 'abr', and 3-7: 'akad'? Wait, perhaps I'm getting the indices wrong.\n\nWait, s_candidate is 'abrakada' (8 letters). s_candidate[-5:] is the last 5 letters: 'raka' ?\n\nWait, 'abrakada' is 8 letters. Indices 0-7.\n\ns_candidate[-5:] is [3,4,5,6,7] → 'akada'.\n\ns_candidate[:5] is [0,1,2,3,4] → 'abraq'? Wait, no.\n\nWait, 'abrakada' → letters are a b r a k a d a.\n\nSo s_candidate[:5] is 'abraq', and s_candidate[-5:] is 'akada' → not equal.\n\nSo k=5 is invalid.\n\nContinue.\n\nk=7: len_s=(21+7)/2=14.\n\ns_candidate is t[0:14-7=7] → first 7 letters: 'abrakad'.\n\nCheck last 7 letters of s_candidate: 'abrakad' → same as first 7. So yes.\n\nSo s_candidate is 'abrakad'.\n\nWait, but in the example, the correct s is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters). So why is this working?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate.\n\nWait, when k=7, len_s is (21+7)/2=14. So s_candidate is t[0:14-7=7], which is 'abrakad'.\n\nNow, check s_candidate[-7:] is 'abrakad' (since 7 letters). So s_candidate[:7] is 'abrakad' → equal. So this is a valid k=7.\n\nBut in the example, the correct s is 'abrakadabra' which is 11 letters. So why is this happening?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Because in the example, t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 21 letters. When k=1, len_s=(21+1)/2=11.\n\ns_candidate is t[0:11-1=10] → 'abrakadabr'.\n\nNow, check s_candidate[-1:] is 'r', and s_candidate[:1] is 'a'. Not equal.\n\nBut when k=7, s_candidate is 'abrakad', which is 7 letters. Its last 7 is 'abrakad', same as first 7. So t is s_candidate + s_candidate[7:].\n\nWait, s_candidate[7:] is nothing because len(s_candidate) is 7. So s_candidate[7:] is empty. So t would be 'abrakad' + '' → 'abrakad', but the actual t is longer. So this seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the way t is built. Let's re-express.\n\nWhen k=7, t is s_candidate followed by s_candidate[7:].\n\ns_candidate is 'abrakad' (7 letters). s_candidate[7:] is the substring starting at index 7, which is beyond the string, so it's empty.\n\nSo t would be 'abrakad' + '' → 'abrakad', which is 7 letters, but in our example, t is 21 letters. So this can't be.\n\nAh, I see! So this approach is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps the way t is built is s_candidate concatenated with s_candidate starting from index k, but only the part that is not overlapped.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model t as s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nSo for k=1, s_candidate is 11 letters. s_candidate[1:] is 10 letters. So t is 11+10=21 letters.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo for the example, when k=1, s_candidate is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters). Then, s_candidate[1:] is 'brakadabra' (10 letters). So t would be 'abrakadabra' + 'brakadabra' → 'abrakadabrabrakadabra', which is 21 letters.\n\nWhich matches the example.\n\nSo in this case, for k=1, len_s is 11, which is (21+1)/2=11.\n\ns_candidate is t[0:11-1=10] → 'abrakadabr' → wait, no. Because 11-1=10. So s_candidate is t[0:10], which is 'abrakadabr'.\n\nWait, that's 10 letters. Then, s_candidate[1:] is 'brakadabr'.\n\nSo t would be 'abrakadabr' + 'brakadabr' → 'abrakadabrrakadabr', which is 20 letters, not 21.\n\nHmm, that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps my approach is incorrect. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nt is formed by s concatenated with s, but the first k characters of the second s are merged with the last k of the first s.\n\nSo t is s + s[k:].\n\nSo for a given k, t must be s + s[k:].\n\nThus, s is the prefix of t, and s[k:] is the suffix of t.\n\nWait, no. Because s + s[k:] is s followed by s starting from k, so the entire t is s followed by s[k:].\n\nSo for a given k, s must be the first part of t, and s[k:] is the second part of t.\n\nThus, len(s) must be len(t) - len(s[k:]).\n\nBut len(s[k:]) is len(s) -k.\n\nSo len(t) = len(s) + (len(s) -k) = 2*len(s) -k.\n\nWhich brings us back to len(s) = (len(t) +k)/2.\n\nSo for a given k, s_candidate is t[0 : len_s], which is the first len_s characters.\n\nThen, check if the remaining part of t (after len_s) equals s_candidate[k:].\n\nBecause t = s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nSo for example, in the first case:\n\nt is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → len(t)=21.\n\nk=1.\n\nlen_s=(21+1)/2=11.\n\ns_candidate is t[0:11] → 'abrakadabr'.\n\nNow, the remaining part of t is t[11:] → 'abrabrkadabra'.\n\nWait, no. Let me count:\n\nt is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → 21 letters.\n\nt[0:11] is 'abrakadabr' (11 letters). Then, t[11:21] is 'abrabrkadabra' (10 letters).\n\nBut s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[1:] → 'brakadabr'.\n\nWhich is 10 letters. Does 'brakadabr' equal 'abrabrkadabra'?\n\nNo. So that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the indices wrong. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, s_candidate is the first len_s characters of t. Then, t must be equal to s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nSo for k=1, s_candidate is 'abrakadabr' (11 letters). s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[1:] → 'brakadabr' (10 letters). So t should be s_candidate + s_candidate[1:] → 11 +10=21 letters.\n\nBut in reality, t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → 21 letters.\n\nSo 'abrakadabr' + 'brakadabr' is 'abrakadabrabrakadabr' → 21 letters, but the actual t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra', which is different.\n\nWait, no. Let's write it out:\n\ns_candidate is 'abrakadabr' → 11 letters.\n\ns_candidate[1:] is 'brakadabr' → 10 letters.\n\nSo s_candidate + s_candidate[1:] is 'abrakadabrabrakadabr' → which is 11+10=21 letters.\n\nBut the actual t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → 'abrakadabrabra...' which is 21 letters.\n\nSo 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' is not equal to 'abrakadabrabrakadabr'.\n\nSo in this case, it's not a match.\n\nWait, but according to the example, it is a match for k=1.\n\nSo what's wrong here.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating len_s.\n\nWait, for k=1, len_s=(21+1)/2=11.\n\ns_candidate is t[0:11], which is 'abrakadabr'.\n\nThen, t is s_candidate + s_candidate[1:].\n\nWhich is 'abrakadabr' + 'brakadabr' → 'abrakadabrabrakadabr'.\n\nBut the actual t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'.\n\nThese two are different.\n\nSo why does the example consider it as a possible solution?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the letters.\n\nLet me count 'abrakadabrabrakadabra':\n\nLetters:\n\n1:a,2:b,3:r,4:a,5:k,6:a,7:d,8:a,9:b,10:r,11:a,12:b,13:r,14:a,15:c,16:a,17:b,18:r,19:a,20:b,21:r, a?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong in the count.\n\nWait, 'abrakadabra' is 11 letters.\n\nSo 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' is 11 +11 -1 =21 letters.\n\nSo the way it's formed is by overlapping 1 character.\n\nSo s_candidate is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters), and the second s is also 'abrakadabra', but overlapping 1 character.\n\nSo t is s_candidate + s_candidate[1:] → 'abrakadabra' + 'brakadabra' → 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 21 letters.\n\nSo in this case, for k=1, len_s is (21+1)/2=11.\n\ns_candidate is t[0:11] → 'abrakadabra'.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought t[0:11] is 'abrakadabr', but perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, let's count:\n\nt is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nIndices 0-10: a b r a k a d a b r a → 'abrakadabra'.\n\nIndices 11-20: b r a k a d a b r a → 'brakadabra'.\n\nSo t[0:11] is 'abrakadabra', which is correct.\n\nThen, s_candidate[1:] is 'brakadabra'.\n\nSo t is s_candidate + s_candidate[1:] → 'abrakadabra' + 'brakadabra' → 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is the correct t.\n\nSo why didn't my earlier code catch this?\n\nAh! Because in my earlier approach, for k=1, I took s_candidate as t[0:10], but that's incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Because len_s is (21 +1)/2=11, so s_candidate is t[0:11], which is correct.\n\nEarlier, I thought that s_candidate was t[0:10], which is wrong. That's a mistake in my approach.\n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\nFor a given k, len_s = (len(t)+k)/2.\n\ns_candidate is t[0: len_s].\n\nThen, check if t[len_s:] equals s_candidate[k:].\n\nBecause t = s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nSo the algorithm should be:\n\nFor each possible k:\n\n   if (len(t)+k) is even:\n\n      len_s = (len(t)+k) // 2\n\n      if len_s < k: continue.\n\n      s_candidate = t[0:len_s]\n\n      if len(t) != len(s_candidate) + len(s_candidate[k:]):\n\n          continue → but this is always true.\n\n      if t[len_s:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n          return s_candidate as possible.\n\nSo this is the correct approach.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nLoop through all possible k (from 1 to len(t)-1):\n\n   if (len(t) +k) is even:\n\n      len_s = (len(t) +k)//2\n\n      if len_s <k: continue.\n\n      s_candidate = t[0: len_s]\n\n      if len(t) != len(s_candidate) + len(s_candidate[k:]):\n\n          continue → but len(s_candidate[k:]) is len(s_candidate) -k = len_s -k.\n\n          len(t) = len(s_candidate) + (len_s -k) = 2*len_s -k → which is correct.\n\n      compare t[len_s:] to s_candidate[k:].\n\n      if equal → return YES and s_candidate.\n\nSo in the first example, for k=1:\n\nlen_s= (21+1)/2=11.\n\ns_candidate is t[0:11] → 'abrakadabra'.\n\nt[len_s:] is t[11:21] → 'brakadabra'.\n\ns_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[1:] → 'brakadabra'.\n\nSo 'brakadabra' == 'brakadabra' → yes.\n\nThus, the code would return YES with s='abrakadabra'.\n\nAnother example: input 'acacacaca' → output 'YES\\nacaca'.\n\nLet's compute for this.\n\nt = 'acacacaca' → len=9.\n\nWe need to find k such that (9 +k) is even → k must be odd.\n\nPossible k:1,3,5,7.\n\nCheck each:\n\nk=1:\n\nlen_s=(9+1)/2=5.\n\ns_candidate is t[0:5] → 'acaca'.\n\nCheck t[5:] → 'caca' → is it equal to s_candidate[1:] → 'caca' → yes.\n\nThus, 'acaca' is a valid s.\n\nSo the code would return YES and 'acaca'.\n\nAnother example: 'abcabc' → output 'NO'.\n\nBecause len(t)=6.\n\nCheck for all possible k.\n\nk must be such that (6 +k) is even → k is even.\n\nPossible k:2,4,6 (but k<6).\n\nk=2:\n\nlen_s=(6+2)/2=4.\n\ns_candidate is t[0:4] → 'abca'.\n\nt[4:] is 'bc' → s_candidate[2:] is 'ca' → 'bc' vs 'ca' → no.\n\nk=4:\n\nlen_s=(6+4)/2=5.\n\ns_candidate is t[0:5] → 'abcab'.\n\nt[5:] is 'c' → s_candidate[4:] is 'b' → no.\n\nk=6: not possible as k must be less than len(t)=6.\n\nOther k's even:\n\nk=6 is excluded.\n\nThus, no valid k, output 'NO'.\n\nAnother example: 'tatbt' → len=5.\n\nCheck k:\n\nFor k=1: (5+1)/2=3 → len_s=3.\n\ns_candidate is 'tat'.\n\nt[3:] is 'bt' → s_candidate[1:] is 'at' → 'bt' vs 'at' → no.\n\nk=3: (5+3)/2=4 → len_s=4.\n\ns_candidate is 'tatb'.\n\nt[4:] is 't' → s_candidate[3:] is 'b' → no.\n\nOther k's even: 5 is odd, but len(t) is 5.\n\nSo no possible k → output 'NO'.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nThus, the plan for the code is:\n\nRead t.\n\nIf len(t) <2 → automatically 'NO' because you can't send two messages.\n\nElse:\n\n   for k in range(1, len(t)):\n\n      if (len(t) +k) %2 !=0 → continue.\n\n      len_s = (len(t)+k)//2\n\n      if len_s <k → continue.\n\n      s_candidate = t[0: len_s]\n\n      if len(t) != len(s_candidate) + len(s_candidate[k:]):\n\n          continue → but this is always true.\n\n      if t[len_s:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n          print('YES')\n\n          print(s_candidate)\n\n          exit.\n\n   After all k's checked, print 'NO'.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nBut wait: in Python, slicing beyond the string returns as much as possible, so t[5:] is fine.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have resulted from an error in the transmission of two identical messages. The error causes the two messages to merge by overlapping the end of the first message with the beginning of the second message by some number of characters `k`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: When two identical messages are sent, they might merge due to an error. The resulting string `t` would be formed by taking the suffix of the first message and appending the prefix of the second message, which is also the same as the first message. This means `t` can be split into two parts where the second part starts at the `k`-th character of the first message.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For a given `t`, we need to check if it can be split into two parts such that the second part matches the first part starting from the `k`-th character. This involves checking all possible values of `k` to see if such a split is possible.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Iterate over all possible values of `k` from 1 to `len(t) - 1`.\n   - For each `k`, check if `(len(t) + k)` is even. If not, skip this `k`.\n   - Calculate the length of the original message `s` as `(len(t) + k) // 2`.\n   - Extract the candidate message `s_candidate` as the first part of `t` up to the length of `s`.\n   - Check if the remaining part of `t` matches the suffix of `s_candidate` starting from `k`.\n\n4. **Complexity**: The algorithm iterates over each possible `k` value, making the time complexity O(n^2), where `n` is the length of `t`. This is efficient given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\nn = len(t)\n\nif n < 2:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    found = False\n    for k in range(1, n):\n        if (n + k) % 2 != 0:\n            continue\n        len_s = (n + k) // 2\n        if len_s < k:\n            continue\n        s_candidate = t[:len_s]\n        if len(t) != len(s_candidate) + len(s_candidate[k:]):\n            continue\n        if t[len_s:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            print(s_candidate)\n            found = True\n            break\n    if not found:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe code reads the input string `t` and checks each possible `k` value to determine if `t` can be split into two parts that match the criteria of an error-induced merge. If such a split is found, it prints \"YES\" followed by the candidate message. If no valid split is found after checking all possible `k` values, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible ways `t` could have been formed by merging two identical messages, providing a solution that handles all edge cases within the problem constraints.",
