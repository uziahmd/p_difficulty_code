After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the number of successful students in a group. A student is considered successful if there's at least one subject where they are the best. Being the best means that no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\nHmm, so for each subject, I need to determine which student has the maximum mark. Then, for each student, check if they are the maximum in any subject.\n\nLet me think about the steps I need to take.\n\nFirst, I'll read the input. The input starts with two integers n and m. Then there are n lines, each representing a student's grades for m subjects. Each line is a string of m characters, each being a digit from 1 to 9.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nEach of the three lines represents a student's marks in three subjects.\n\nFor each subject, I need to find the maximum mark across all students. Then, for each student, if in any of their subject marks they are equal to the maximum for that subject, then they are considered the best in that subject. But wait, no— the problem says \"the best\" is defined as having no one higher. So if a student has the maximum mark in a subject, they are the best for that subject.\n\nWait, no. Because if another student also has the same maximum mark, then neither is better than the other. So the definition is: for a student to be the best in a subject, they must have the highest mark, and it's possible that others have the same, but no one has higher.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: \"a student is the best at a subject if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\" So if two students have the same maximum mark, then both are the best in that subject because neither has a higher mark. So each can count as being the best for that subject.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if two students have the same maximum, then for each of them, there exists no one with a higher mark. So both are best in that subject.\n\nBut for our problem, we need to count for each student whether they are the best in any subject. So even if two students have the same maximum in a subject, each counts towards being successful because they are best in that subject.\n\nWait, that's correct. For example, if two students have the maximum in a subject, say 5, then each is the best for that subject because no one has higher than 5. So both would contribute to being successful.\n\nSo the approach is: for each subject, find all students who have the maximum mark in that subject. Then, for each student, check if they are in the set of maximums for any subject. If yes, count them as successful.\n\nSo, how do I implement this?\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n2. For each of the next n lines, read the string, split into individual characters (each representing a subject mark for that student).\n3. For each subject (from 0 to m-1), track the maximum mark across all students.\n4. For each subject, collect all students who have that maximum mark.\n5. For each student, check if they are in the max list for at least one subject.\n6. Count the number of such students.\n\nAlternatively, for each subject, determine the maximum value, then for each student, compare their mark in that subject to the maximum. If it's equal, then they are a candidate for being the best in that subject.\n\nWait, perhaps a more efficient way is:\n\n- For each subject s:\n   - Find the maximum mark among all students for s.\n   - For each student, if their mark in s is equal to the maximum, add s to their list of 'best' subjects.\n\nThen, for each student, if their list is non-empty, increment the count.\n\nSo, let's think about data structures. We can represent each student's marks as a list of integers. Then, for each subject, compute the max, and for each student, check if their mark in that subject equals the max. If yes, then they are a best in that subject.\n\nYes, that seems manageable.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Read the input lines, converting each student's string into a list of integers.\n- For each subject (0 to m-1):\n   - Compute the maximum mark across all students in that subject.\n- For each student, create a flag or a counter indicating whether they are the best in any subject.\n- Iterate over each subject again, and for each student, if their mark in that subject is equal to the subject's max, mark them as successful.\n- Finally, count how many students have been marked as successful.\n\nWait, but for each subject, the max",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: First, read the number of students `n` and the number of subjects `m`. Then, read each student's grades which are provided as a string of digits.\n2. **Convert Grades**: Convert each student's grade string into a list of integers for easier manipulation.\n3. **Determine Maximum Marks**: For each subject, find the maximum mark among all students.\n4. **Identify Successful Students**: For each student, check if their mark in any subject matches the maximum mark for that subject. If they do, mark them as successful.\n5. **Count Successful Students**: Count how many students have been marked as successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    s = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in s]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nmax_marks = []\nfor i in range(m):\n    max_val = max(students[j][i] for j in range(n))\n    max_marks.append(max_val)\n\nsuccessful = [False] * n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if students[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n            successful[i] = True\n            break\n\nprint(sum(successful))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line contains `n` and `m`, followed by `n` lines each representing a student's grades. Each grade string is converted into a list of integers.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (from 0 to `m-1`), compute the maximum mark across all students. This helps in determining who the best student is for each subject.\n3. **Checking Success**: For each student, iterate through their marks in each subject. If a mark matches the maximum for that subject, mark the student as successful and move to the next student.\n4. **Counting Successes**: Finally, count the number of successful students and print the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the successful students by leveraging simple loops and conditional checks, making it both clear and efficient.",
