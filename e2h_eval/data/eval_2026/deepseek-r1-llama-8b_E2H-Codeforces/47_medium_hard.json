    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where given two integers a and b, I have to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a+k) and (b+k) is minimized. And if there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest one.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's happening when we add k to both a and b. The new numbers are a + k and b + k. But wait, since a and b could be in any order, maybe I should first compute the difference between them. Oh right, because if a is larger than b, then adding k to both doesn't change their difference. So the difference is fixed as |a - b|. Let's denote d = |a - b|.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding k such that the two numbers x = a + k and y = b + k have their LCM minimized. Since x and y differ by d, which is fixed, perhaps the optimal k can be found by considering their greatest common divisor (gcd).\n\nWait, because for two numbers x and y, LCM(x, y) = (x * y) / GCD(x, y). So to minimize the LCM, we need to maximize the GCD of x and y.\n\nSo our goal is to find x and y such that x = a + k, y = b + k, and GCD(x, y) is as large as possible. Because the higher the GCD, the lower the LCM.\n\nSo the key is to find the maximum possible g such that g divides both x and y, which implies g must divide their difference, which is d. So g must be a divisor of d.\n\nTherefore, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|.\n2. Find all possible divisors of d.\n3. For each divisor g, check if it's possible to choose k such that g divides both x and y.\n4. Among all such g's, find the one that maximizes g, because higher g leads to lower LCM.\n5. Once the maximum g is found, find the smallest k that satisfies the conditions.\n\nWait, but how do we find the maximum possible g? Because the largest possible g is d itself, but that would require x and y to be multiples of d. Let's see.\n\nIf g is a divisor of d, then x and y must be multiples of g. So x = m * g, y = n * g. Also, since y - x = d, which is divisible by g, that's consistent.\n\nSo for each divisor g of d, we can try to find k such that a + k is congruent to 0 mod g and similarly for b + k. Wait, no. Because a + k ≡ 0 mod g and b + k ≡ 0 mod g. So subtracting these gives (a +k) - (b +k) = a - b ≡ 0 mod g. Which is true because g divides d = |a - b|.\n\nSo for each g dividing d, we can attempt to find the minimal k that makes a + k ≡ 0 mod g. Then, for that k, check if it's non-negative and also ensures that b + k is divisible by g.\n\nWait, no. Because if g divides d, then (a +k) and (b +k) will be congruent modulo g. Because (a +k) - (b +k) = a - b = d, which is divisible by g. So if (a +k) is congruent to 0 mod g, then (b +k) is congruent to -d mod g, which is the same as (g - (d mod g)) mod g. Hmm, maybe that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, since a +k must be divisible by g, then k ≡ (-a) mod g. So the minimal k is (g - a mod g) if a mod g is not zero. Otherwise, k is 0.\n\nBut wait, that's only for the case when a mod g is zero. Or perhaps the minimal k is (g - (a mod g)) % g, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, for example, if a mod g is r, then to make a +k ≡ 0 mod g, k must be equal to (g - r) mod g. So the smallest non-negative k is (g - r) if r != 0, else 0.\n\nSo for each divisor g of d, the required k is (g - (a mod g)) % g. But since a mod g is always less than g, (g - (a mod g)) is the required k. However, this k may be negative if a mod g is zero, but in that case, k is zero.\n\nWait, no. If a mod g is zero, then k can be zero, which is the smallest possible. So for each g, the minimal k needed is (g - (a mod g)) if a mod g != 0, else 0. But wait, that's not correct because when a mod g is zero, then a is already divisible by g. So k can be zero.\n\nBut then, for each g, the required k is (g - (a mod g)) if a mod g is not zero, else 0. But since k must be non-negative, this is acceptable.\n\nSo for each g, we can calculate the required k as (g - (a mod g)) % g. Wait, no. Because if a mod g is zero, then (g - (a mod g)) is g, but mod g would be zero. So yes, the formula (g - (a mod g)) % g gives the correct k, which is zero when a is divisible by g.\n\nOnce we have the required k for each g, we can compute the resulting x and y, and then compute the LCM. But wait, for a given g, the maximum possible g is the one that will give the minimal LCM. So perhaps the approach is to iterate through all possible divisors of d in descending order and for each, compute the required k. If that k is non-negative, then compute the LCM for that k, and keep track of the minimal LCM and the corresponding k.\n\nWait, but why do we need to process the divisors in descending order? Because we want to find the largest possible g first. The larger the g, the smaller the LCM, assuming all other factors are the same.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute d = abs(a - b).\n   - If d is zero, then a and b are equal. So a +k and b +k are equal, so LCM is a +k. To minimize it, set k=0.\n2. Else, find all divisors of d.\n3. Sort the divisors in descending order.\n4. For each g in this order:\n   a. Compute the required k: k = (g - (a % g)) % g.\n      - Since a can be less than g, a % g is just a. So for example, if a is 6 and g is 4, a%g is 2, so k is 4-2=2.\n   b. Check if k is >=0.\n   c. Compute x = a +k, y = b +k.\n   d. Compute current_gcd = gcd(x, y).\n      - Since x and y are both multiples of g, the current_gcd must be a multiple of g. So current_gcd = g * h, where h is the gcd of (x/g) and (y/g).\n   e. The LCM is (x * y) / current_gcd. But since x and y are a +k and b +k, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n   f. Keep track of the minimal LCM and the corresponding k. If a larger g gives a smaller LCM, update the result.\n5. After checking all g's, the minimal LCM and k is found.\n\nWait, but for some g's, the computed k may be such that a +k and b +k are both positive. But since a and b are positive and k is non-negative, this is always true.\n\nBut why are we considering all divisors of d? Because any common divisor of a +k and b +k must divide d. So all possible g's are the divisors of d.\n\nSo first, I need to find all the divisors of d. Then, process them in descending order.\n\nNow, how do I find all the divisors of d?\n\nI can write a function that finds all divisors of a number efficiently. For that, I can factorize d into its prime factors, then generate all possible products of these factors.\n\nBut factorizing d could be time-consuming if d is up to 1e9, but with efficient trial division, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for each i from 1 to sqrt(d), check if d is divisible by i. If yes, add i and d/i to the list of divisors, ensuring no duplicates when d is a square.\n\nYes, that's manageable.\n\nSo, steps in code:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute d = abs(a - b).\n\nIf d == 0:\n   print 0\nElse:\n   Find all divisors of d.\n   Sort them in descending order.\n   For each g in this sorted list:\n       compute k = (g - (a % g)) % g\n       if k < 0: skip (but shouldn't happen)\n       x = a + k\n       y = b + k\n       current_gcd = gcd(x, y)\n       lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n       keep track of the minimal lcm and the corresponding k.\n   After processing all g's, output the k with the smallest lcm. If multiple k's have the same minimal lcm, choose the smallest k.\n\nWait, but in the case where a = b, as in d=0, then x and y are equal for any k. So their LCM is x (or y). To minimize, set k=0.\n\nAnother edge case: when a = 5 and b =10. So d=5.\n\nWait, the sample input includes '5 10', and the output is 0. Because 5+0=5, 10+0=10. Their LCM is 10. But is that the minimal?\n\nWait, another possible k is 5: 5+5=10, 10+5=15. LCM is 30, which is worse. So yes, k=0 is better.\n\nWait, but let's compute for other possible g's.\n\nWait, d is 5, so its divisors are 1,5.\n\nProcessing g=5 first.\n\nFor g=5, k is (5 - (5%5)) mod5 → (5 -0) mod5 =0.\n\nSo x=5+0=5, y=10+0=10. LCM is 10.\n\nThen for g=1.\n\nk is (1 - (5%1)) mod1 → (1 -0) mod1=0.\n\nx=5, y=10. LCM is 10.\n\nSo for both g=5 and g=1, the LCM is 10. But since g=5 is processed first, and it's larger, so the k is 0, which is the minimal possible.\n\nSo in that case, the output is 0.\n\nWait, but what if a and b are such that for a certain g, the k is negative? No, because k is computed as (g - (a mod g)) mod g, which is always non-negative.\n\nWait, no. Let me test with an example.\n\nSuppose a=7, b=14, d=7.\n\nDivisors are 7 and 1.\n\nFor g=7:\n\nk = (7 -7%7) mod7 → 0 mod7=0.\n\nSo x=7, y=14. LCM is 14.\n\nFor g=1:\n\nk = (1 -7%1) mod1 → (1-0) mod1=0.\n\nx=7, y=14. Same as before.\n\nSo the minimal k is 0.\n\nAnother test case: a=6, b=10, d=4.\n\nSample input's first case.\n\nd=4. Divisors are 4, 2, 1.\n\nProcessing g=4 first.\n\nk = (4 -6%4) mod4 →6 mod4 is 2, so 4-2=2 mod4=2.\n\nx=8, y=12. GCD(8,12)=4. LCM is (8*12)/4=24.\n\nNext, g=2.\n\nk = (2 -6%2) mod2 →6 mod2=0, so 2-0=2 mod2=0.\n\nx=6, y=10. GCD is 2. LCM is 30.\n\nThen g=1: k=0, x=6, y=10. LCM is 30.\n\nSo the minimal LCM is 24, achieved at k=2. So that's the answer.\n\nSo the approach seems to work.\n\nBut wait, what about when a < g? Like a=3, g=5.\n\nThen a mod g is 3, so k =5-3=2. So a +k =5, which is divisible by 5.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: a=10, b=21. So d=11.\n\nThe sample's second input is 21 31, but wait, wait, sorry, the sample input is ['6 10', '21 31', '5 10'], and the outputs are 2,9,0.\n\nWait, for the second case, a=21, b=31. d=10.\n\nWait, no, 31-21=10. So d=10.\n\nThe divisors of 10 are 10,5,2,1.\n\nProcessing g=10: k=(10 - (21%10)) mod10 →21 mod10 is 1, so 10-1=9 mod10=9.\n\nx=21+9=30, y=31+9=40. GCD(30,40)=10. LCM is 30*40/10=120.\n\ng=5: k= (5 - (21%5)) mod5 →21 mod5 is 1, so 5-1=4 mod5=4.\n\nx=25, y=35. GCD is 5. LCM is 25*35 /5 = 175.\n\ng=2: k= (2 - (21%2)) mod2 →21 mod2 is 1. 2-1=1 mod2=1.\n\nx=22, y=32. GCD is 2. LCM is 22*32/2=352.\n\ng=1: k=0. x=21, y=31. GCD is 1. LCM is 21*31=651.\n\nSo the minimal LCM is 120, achieved at k=9.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this.\n\nBut how to handle the cases where a is larger than b or vice versa?\n\nIn the code, since d is absolute value, it's handled.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\n1. Read a and b.\n\n2. Compute d = abs(a - b).\n\n3. If d is zero, output 0.\n\n4. Else, find all the divisors of d.\n\n   a. For that, iterate i from 1 to sqrt(d), and for each i that divides d, add i and d//i to the list of divisors.\n\n   b. Then, sort the list in descending order.\n\n5. Initialize variables to track the minimal LCM and the corresponding k. Start with initial values as the first possible case.\n\n6. Iterate over each g in the sorted divisors:\n\n   a. Compute k = (g - (a % g)) % g.\n\n   b. If k is negative, skip (but since mod is involved, it's not possible).\n\n   c. Compute x = a + k, y = b +k.\n\n   d. Compute the GCD of x and y.\n\n   e. Compute the LCM of x and y.\n\n   f. Compare this LCM with the current minimal. If it's smaller, update the minimal and the best_k.\n\n   g. If it's equal to the current minimal, check if k is smaller than the current best_k. If so, update.\n\n7. After processing all g's, output the best_k.\n\nWait, but in the case where a and b are swapped, like a=10, b=6. Does the code still work? Yes, because d is 4, and the code processes the divisors correctly.\n\nNow, the issue is how to compute all the divisors of d.\n\nLet me think about how to implement that.\n\nImplementing a function to get all divisors:\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) +1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(divisors, reverse=True)\n\nBut wait, for n=0, but in our case, d is at least 0, but when a ==b, d is zero. So in that case, we output 0.\n\nSo in the code, when d is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nAnother thing: when d is 1, the divisors are [1]. So that's handled.\n\nNow, the next step is to compute the GCD of x and y for each g.\n\nBut computing GCD for very large numbers could be time-consuming, but in Python, math.gcd is efficient.\n\nWait, but in Python, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since x and y are positive (since a and b are positive and k is non-negative), it's okay.\n\nSo in code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef compute_lcm(x, y):\n    return x * y // math.gcd(x, y)\n\nBut wait, for very large x and y (up to 2e9 each?), their product could be up to 4e18, which is manageable in Python.\n\nSo the code can proceed.\n\nNow, let's think about the initial state.\n\nWe can initialize min_lcm as a very large number, say infinity, and best_k as None.\n\nFor each g in the sorted list of divisors:\n\n   compute k.\n\n   compute x = a +k, y = b +k.\n\n   compute current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y).\n\n   current_lcm = (x*y)//current_gcd.\n\n   if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n\n       update min_lcm and best_k.\n\n   elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n\n       if k < best_k:\n\n           update best_k.\n\nSo after processing all g's, best_k is the desired k.\n\nBut wait, in the case where a > b, adding k to both, but the code treats a and b as is. So the code is correct.\n\nTesting another example:\n\nInput: 5 10.\n\nd=5.\n\ndivisors are 5,1.\n\nProcessing g=5:\n\nk = (5 -5%5) mod5 →0.\n\nx=5, y=10. GCD=5. LCM=10.\n\ng=1:\n\nk=0. x=5, y=10. same as above.\n\nSo best_k is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=5.\n\nd=2.\n\ndivisors: 2,1.\n\nProcessing g=2:\n\nk = (2 -3%2) mod2 →3 mod2 is 1. 2-1=1 mod2=1.\n\nx=4, y=6. GCD is 2. LCM is (4*6)/2=12.\n\ng=1:\n\nk=0. x=3, y=5. GCD=1. LCM=15.\n\nSo minimal is 12, achieved at k=1.\n\nBut wait, is there a better k?\n\nWhat about k=2?\n\nx=5, y=7. GCD=1. LCM=35.\n\nNo, worse.\n\nWhat about k=3:\n\nx=6, y=8. GCD=2. LCM=24.\n\nWhich is higher than 12. So k=1 is better.\n\nSo code correctly returns k=1.\n\nWait, but what if a=4, b=6.\n\nd=2.\n\ndivisors: 2,1.\n\ng=2:\n\nk= (2 -4%2) mod2 →4 mod2=0 →2-0=2 mod2=0.\n\nx=4, y=6. GCD=2. LCM=12.\n\ng=1:\n\nk=0. x=4, y=6. same as above.\n\nSo best_k is 0.\n\nAnother test case: a=2, b=4.\n\nd=2.\n\ng=2:\n\nk = (2 -2%2) mod2=0.\n\nx=2, y=4. LCM=4.\n\ng=1:\n\nk=0. x=2, y=4. same.\n\nSo best_k is 0.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: a=7, b=14.\n\nd=7.\n\ng=7:\n\nk=0. x=7, y=14. LCM=14.\n\ng=1:\n\nk=0. same.\n\nSo best_k is 0.\n\nAnother test case: a=8, b=12.\n\nd=4.\n\ndivisors:4,2,1.\n\ng=4:\n\nk = (4 -8%4) mod4 →8 mod4=0 →4-0=4 mod4=0.\n\nx=8, y=12. LCM=24.\n\ng=2:\n\nk = (2 -8%2) mod2 →8 mod2=0 →2-0=2 mod2=0.\n\nx=8, y=12. same as before.\n\ng=1:\n\nk=0. same.\n\nSo best_k is 0.\n\nBut wait, what if a=9 and b=15.\n\nd=6.\n\ndivisors:6,3,2,1.\n\ng=6:\n\nk = (6 -9%6) mod6 →9 mod6=3 →6-3=3 mod6=3.\n\nx=12, y=18. GCD=6. LCM=36.\n\ng=3:\n\nk = (3 -9%3) mod3 →9 mod3=0 →3-0=3 mod3=0.\n\nx=12, y=18. same as above.\n\ng=2:\n\nk= (2 -9%2) mod2 →9 mod2=1 →2-1=1 mod2=1.\n\nx=10, y=16. GCD=2. LCM= 80.\n\ng=1:\n\nk=0. x=9, y=15. GCD=3. LCM=45.\n\nSo the minimal is 36, achieved at k=3.\n\nSo the code would correctly pick that.\n\nSo, the plan is solid.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead a and b as integers.\n\nCompute d = abs(a - b).\n\nIf d == 0:\n\n   print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n   compute all divisors of d.\n\n   sort them in descending order.\n\n   initialize min_lcm to a very high value.\n\n   best_k = None.\n\n   for g in divisors:\n\n       k = (g - (a % g)) % g\n\n       x = a +k\n\n       y = b +k\n\n       current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n\n       current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n\n       if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n\n           min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n           best_k = k\n\n       elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n\n           if k < best_k:\n\n               best_k = k\n\n   print(best_k)\n\nBut wait, wait: when a > b, does that affect anything? Because in the code, a and b are used as is, but the formula for k is based on a. So, suppose a=10, b=6. d=4.\n\nProcessing g=4:\n\nk = (4 -10%4) mod4 →10 mod4=2 →4-2=2 mod4=2.\n\nx=12, y=8. GCD is 4. LCM= (12*8)/4=24.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code works regardless of whether a is larger or smaller.\n\nAnother thing to consider: when a and b are 1e9 each. Then d=0, so k=0.\n\nBut when a and b are 1e9 and 1e9 -1, then d=1. The code will process g=1.\n\nk = (1 - (a%1)) mod1 →0. So x=1e9, y=1e9-1. GCD is 1. LCM is 1e9*(1e9-1).\n\nBut for this case, the code will process it.\n\nSo, now, the code needs to handle all cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Time constraints: for d up to 1e9, the number of divisors is up to around 1000 (since 1e9 has factors like 2^something, etc.). So for each test case, the loop runs in O(1000), which is manageable.\n\n- Edge cases where a or b is zero. But according to the problem statement, a and b are at least 1. So no problem.\n\nAnother edge case: when a=1, b=2. d=1.\n\ndivisors:1.\n\ng=1:\n\nk= (1 -1%1) mod1 →0.\n\nx=1, y=2. LCM=2.\n\nIs this the minimal possible? Let's see.\n\nWhat if k=1: x=2, y=3. LCM=6.\n\nk=2: x=3, y=4. LCM=12.\n\nSo yes, k=0 is the best.\n\nAnother example: a=2, b=3. d=1.\n\ng=1: k=0. x=2, y=3. LCM=6.\n\nIs there a better k?\n\nk=1: x=3, y=4. LCM=12.\n\nk=2: x=4, y=5. LCM=20.\n\nSo no, k=0 is best.\n\nThus, code works.\n\nNow, implement the code.\n\nBut wait, for the function to get all divisors, I have to include all unique divisors. So using a set is good.\n\nAlso, after collecting the divisors, they should be sorted in descending order.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nImport math.\n\nRead a, b.\n\nd = abs(a - b)\n\nif d ==0:\n\n   print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n   compute all divisors.\n\n   divisors = set()\n\n   for i in 1 to sqrt(d):\n\n       if d%i ==0:\n\n           add i and d//i to divisors.\n\n   sorted_divisors = sorted(list(divisors), reverse=True)\n\n   min_lcm = something big.\n\n   best_k = None.\n\n   for g in sorted_divisors:\n\n       k = (g - (a %g )) %g\n\n       x = a +k\n\n       y = b +k\n\n       current_gcd = math.gcd(x,y)\n\n       current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n\n       if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n\n           min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n           best_k = k\n\n       elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n\n           if k < best_k:\n\n               best_k = k\n\n   print(best_k)\n\nSo the code is manageable.\n\nBut wait, the function to get the divisors needs to handle n=0? Well, no, since in the else clause, d is non-zero.\n\nNow, test the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n6 10 → Output 2.\n\nd=4. Divisors:4,2,1.\n\nProcessing g=4: k= (4 -6%4) mod4 →6%4=2 →4-2=2 mod4=2.\n\nx=8, y=12. GCD=4. LCM=24.\n\ng=2: k= (2-6%2) mod2 →6%2=0 →2 mod2=0.\n\nx=6, y=10. GCD=2. LCM=30.\n\ng=1: k=0. x=6, y=10. LCM=30.\n\nSo minimal is 24, achieved at k=2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n21 31 → d=10. Divisors:10,5,2,1.\n\ng=10:\n\nk=10-21%10=10-1=9 mod10=9.\n\nx=30, y=40. GCD=10. LCM=120.\n\ng=5:\n\nk=5-21%5=5-1=4 mod5=4.\n\nx=25, y=35. GCD=5. LCM=175.\n\ng=2:\n\nk=2-21%2=2-1=1 mod2=1.\n\nx=22, y=32. GCD=2. LCM= 352.\n\ng=1:\n\nk=0. x=21, y=31. GCD=1. LCM=651.\n\nSo minimal is 120, achieved at k=9. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n5 10 → d=5. Divisors:5,1.\n\ng=5: k=0. x=5, y=10. LCM=10.\n\ng=1: k=0. same.\n\nSo output 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for samples.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=5. d=2.\n\ndivisors:2,1.\n\ng=2:\n\nk=2-3%2=2-1=1 mod2=1.\n\nx=4, y=6. LCM=12.\n\ng=1: k=0. x=3, y=5. LCM=15.\n\nSo best_k is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, in Python, implement this.\n\nBut wait, in the code, when a and b are such that a <k, but in code, x =a +k could be larger than 1e18, but in Python, it's fine.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- When a and b are very large, but the code still runs quickly.\n\nBut with the number of divisors being small, it's manageable.\n\nSo, code:\n\nImport math.\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute d.\n\nIf d is zero, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nFind all divisors.\n\nProcess each.\n\nCompute k.\n\nCompute x, y.\n\nCompute current_lcm.\n\nTrack the best.\n\nFinally, output best_k.\n\nSo, the code in Python:\n\nimport math\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nd = abs(a - b)\nif d == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Find all divisors of d\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(d)) + 1):\n        if d % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(d // i)\n    sorted_divisors = sorted(divisors, reverse=True)\n    \n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = None\n    \n    for g in sorted_divisors:\n        # Compute k\n        remainder = a % g\n        k = (g - remainder) % g\n        \n        x = a + k\n        y = b + k\n        \n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n        \n        if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k\n        elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n            if k < best_k:\n                best_k = k\n                \n    print(best_k)\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \\( k \\) that yield the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key insight is that the difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), denoted as \\( d \\), remains constant when \\( k \\) is added to both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). The goal is to maximize the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) because a higher GCD leads to a lower LCM.\n\n2. **Divisors of \\( d \\)**: Since any common divisor of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) must divide \\( d \\), we consider all divisors of \\( d \\). These divisors are potential candidates for maximizing the GCD.\n\n3. **Finding Optimal \\( k \\)**: For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( d \\), we compute the smallest \\( k \\) such that both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) are divisible by \\( g \\). This \\( k \\) is derived from the congruence \\( a + k \\equiv 0 \\mod g \\).\n\n4. **Compute LCM**: For each candidate \\( k \\), compute the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\). Track the minimum LCM and the corresponding \\( k \\).\n\n5. **Edge Cases**: If \\( a \\) equals \\( b \\), the optimal \\( k \\) is zero since the LCM will be the value of \\( a \\) (or \\( b \\)).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nd = abs(a - b)\nif d == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(d)) + 1):\n        if d % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(d // i)\n    sorted_divisors = sorted(divisors, reverse=True)\n    \n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = None\n    \n    for g in sorted_divisors:\n        remainder = a % g\n        k = (g - remainder) % g\n        \n        x = a + k\n        y = b + k\n        \n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n        \n        if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k\n        elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n            if k < best_k:\n                best_k = k\n                \n    print(best_k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n2. **Compute Difference**: Calculate \\( d \\) as the absolute difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n3. **Find Divisors**: Identify all divisors of \\( d \\) and sort them in descending order.\n4. **Iterate Over Divisors**: For each divisor \\( g \\), compute the smallest \\( k \\) that makes \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) divisible by \\( g \\).\n5. **Track Minimum LCM**: For each computed \\( k \\), determine the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) and keep track of the smallest LCM and corresponding \\( k \\).\n6. **Output Result**: Print the optimal \\( k \\) that minimizes the LCM.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( k \\) by leveraging the properties of divisors and GCD, ensuring an optimal solution within reasonable computational limits.",
