    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I'm given a string, and I have to find the length of its longest substring that appears at least twice. The occurrences can overlap. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about the examples they gave. For 'abcd', the output is 0 because all substrings are unique. For 'ababa', the output is 3 because the substring 'aba' appears starting at position 0 and 2. And for 'zzz', it's 2 because 'zz' appears twice.\n\nSo the task is to find the maximum possible length L such that there exists a substring of length L that appears more than once in the string.\n\nHow do I approach this?\n\nI remember that for substring problems, sliding window techniques are often used. But since I'm looking for the maximum possible length, maybe I should start checking from the largest possible L down to 1. Once I find an L where a substring of that length appears at least twice, I can return that L.\n\nBut wait, how do I efficiently check for each L? Because for each L, I need to look through all possible substrings of that length and see if any appears more than once.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate L from the maximum possible (length of string - 1) down to 1.\n2. For each L, collect all substrings of length L in a set or a dictionary to track their occurrences.\n3. If any substring is found more than once, return L as the answer.\n4. If none are found for a particular L, continue to L-1.\n\nBut wait, what's the maximum possible L? It's the length of the string minus 1. Because for a string of length N, the maximum possible substring that can appear twice must be at most N-1. Like in 'aaa', the maximum is 2.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: 'aaaaa' has substrings of length 4 that appear multiple times. So the maximum L is len(s) - 1.\n\nWait, no, for a string of length n, the maximum possible L is n-1. Because you need two occurrences. For example, in 'abab', the maximum L is 2 because 'aba' occurs once, but 'ab' occurs twice. Wait, no, 'ab' occurs twice, so L=2.\n\nWait, for 'ababa', the maximum L is 3. Because 'aba' starts at 0 and 2.\n\nSo yes, the initial approach is correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, get the input string. Then, for each possible L from (n-1) down to 1:\n\nFor each L, generate all possible substrings of that length and see if any appear more than once.\n\nIf any do, return L. If not, move to L-1.\n\nNow, the challenge is to efficiently generate these substrings and track their occurrence.\n\nLet me think about the data structure. For each L, I can create a dictionary where the key is the substring and the value is a list of starting indices. But for this problem, I don't care about the positions, just whether the same substring appears more than once.\n\nAlternatively, for each L, I can use a set to store all the substrings. As I generate each substring, if I find that it's already in the set, then we have a duplicate. So for each L, iterate through all possible substrings, and for each, check if it's been seen before.\n\nOnce a duplicate is found, we can immediately break and return L as the answer.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nmax_len = 0\nfor L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(0, len(s) - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            # Found a duplicate\n            return L\n        else:\n            seen.add(substr)\n# After all Ls, if nothing found, return 0\nreturn 0\n\nWait, but in the first sample, 'abcd' has no substrings that repeat, so the function returns 0.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nBut wait, what about when L is len(s)? That's not possible because you can't have a substring longer than the string itself. So the loop should start from len(s)-1 down to 1.\n\nWait, let's see: the maximum possible L is len(s) - 1. Because for a string like 'aa', L=1. For a string of length 3, the maximum possible L is 2.\n\nSo the loop should run L from len(s)-1 down to 1.\n\nBut wait, for len(s) == 1, the code will go into the loop for L=0, which is not correct. So perhaps we should handle that case.\n\nWait, the problem says the string is non-empty. So for a single character string, the maximum possible L is 0, because there's only one occurrence.\n\nSo in the code, for len(s) < 2, the output is 0.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nif len(s) < 2: return 0\n\nelse:\n\nloop L from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\n   for each L, check all substrings of length L.\n\n   if any substring is found twice, return L.\n\nafter all Ls, return 0.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows.\n\nNow, let's test this logic with the examples.\n\nExample 1: 'abcd'\n\nlen is 4.\n\nCheck L=3: all substrings are 'abc', 'bcd'. No duplicates.\n\nL=2: 'ab','bc','cd'. No duplicates.\n\nL=1: 'a','b','c','d'. No duplicates. So return 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nExample 2: 'ababa' len=5.\n\nCheck L=4: possible substrings 'abab', 'baba'. No duplicates.\n\nL=3: substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. So when i=0, substr 'aba' added. When i=2, substr 'aba' is found again. So return 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThird example: 'zzz' len=3.\n\nCheck L=2: 'zz' at i=0, then 'zz' at i=1. So on the second occurrence, it's found, so return 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa' len=5.\n\nCheck L=4: substrings are 'aaaa', 'aaaa' (from i=0 and i=1). So when i=1, substr is 'aaaa' which is already in the set. So return 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcabc' len=6.\n\nCheck L=5: substrings 'abcab' and 'bcabc'—no duplicates.\n\nL=4: check all possible substrings of length 4. Are any duplicates? 'abca', 'bcab', 'cabc' — no.\n\nL=3: 'abc' occurs at i=0, then 'bca' at i=1, 'cab' at i=2, 'abc' at i=3. So when i=3, substr is 'abc' which was added at i=0. So return 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWhat about a string like 'ababab'? The maximum L is 4.\n\nSubstrings of length 4 are 'abab', 'baba', 'abab'. So when i=0 and i=2, substr 'abab' is found again. So return 4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the algorithm seems to work.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nIn Python, the code would read the string, then for each L from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\n   for each starting index i from 0 to len(s)-L:\n\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substr is in the seen set:\n\n           print(L)\n\n           exit\n\n       else:\n\n           add to seen.\n\nIf after all Ls, no duplicates, print 0.\n\nThis should work.\n\nBut wait, what about the time complexity? For each L, the number of substrings is (n-L+1). For each substring, checking if it's in a set is O(1), so overall for each L, it's O(n) operations. Since L ranges from n-1 down to 1, the total time is O(n^2). For n=100, that's manageable.\n\nSo for n=100, 100 * 100 = 10,000 operations. Which is acceptable.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nWe need to read the input. Wait, the input is given as a list in the example, but in reality, the input is a single line, which is the string.\n\nSo in the code, we can read the string using input().strip().\n\nThen, compute len_s = len(s).\n\nIf len_s < 2, print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nfor L in range(len_s-1, 0, -1):\n\n   seen = set()\n\n   for i in range(0, len_s - L + 1):\n\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substr in seen:\n\n           print(L)\n\n           exit()\n\n       seen.add(substr)\n\nSo after trying all Ls and finding none, print 0.\n\nWait, but in the code, after the loop, we have to print 0.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nThe code could look like this:\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nif n < 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    max_possible = n - 1\n    for L in range(max_possible, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                exit()\n            seen.add(substr)\n    print(0)\n\nWait, but in the first sample input, the output is a list, but in the problem statement, the output is a single number. Oh wait, the sample shows the outputs as a list, but perhaps that's a typo.\n\nWait, no. The problem says \"Output one number — length of the longest substring...\".\n\nSo in the code, after processing, we print the integer value.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, for 'ababa', the output is 3, which is an integer.\n\nSo the code should print the integer, not a list.\n\nBut in the sample input, it's written as ['0', '3', '2'], but that's probably a mistake. Because in programming competitions, the output is a single integer per test case.\n\nSo our code should output an integer.\n\nSo the code is correct as written.\n\nTesting the code with the samples:\n\nSample 1: 'abcd' → output 0.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa' → 3.\n\nSample 3: 'zzz' → 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'a' → 0.\n\nAnother test case: 'aa' → 1.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaa' → 2.\n\nAll correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to find the maximum length of a substring that appears more than once. If no such substring exists, the result should be 0.\n2. **Intuition**: We can use a sliding window technique to check for each possible substring length starting from the maximum possible down to 1. For each length, we check if any substring of that length appears more than once.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We iterate over each possible substring length from the maximum possible (length of string - 1) down to 1. For each length, we use a set to track substrings and check for duplicates. If a duplicate is found, we immediately return the current length as the result.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The time complexity is O(n^2) where n is the length of the string. This is efficient enough for strings up to length 100.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nif n < 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    max_possible = n - 1\n    for L in range(max_possible, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                exit()\n            seen.add(substr)\n    print(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and its length is determined.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the string length is less than 2, the result is immediately 0 because no substring of length greater than 0 can appear twice.\n3. **Iterating Over Possible Lengths**: We start from the longest possible substring length and decrement down to 1. For each length `L`, we generate all possible substrings of that length.\n4. **Tracking Substrings**: Using a set, we track each substring we encounter. If a substring is found again, it means it has appeared at least twice, so we print the current length and exit.\n5. **Output Result**: If no duplicate substring is found after checking all possible lengths, we print 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the longest repeating substring by leveraging a sliding window technique and set operations for quick lookups.",
