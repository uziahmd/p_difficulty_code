Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Vasily has some candles and can make new ones from the stubs. The goal is to calculate the maximum number of hours he can keep the room lit. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nHmm, the problem says that each candle burns for one hour and then goes out. But when it goes out, Vasily can collect the stubs. For every b stubs, he can make a new candle. So, the process is like: burn as many as possible, then use the stubs to make more, and repeat until he can't make any more.\n\nLet me think about an example. Like the first sample input: 4 candles. He burns all 4, getting 4 stubs. With b=2, 4/2=2 new candles. So he burns those, adding 2 stubs (total 6). Then 6/2=3 new candles. Burn them, add 3 stubs (total 9). 9/2 is 4 with remainder 1. So he makes 4 new candles, burns them, adds 4 stubs (13 in total), which gives 6 more (since 13//2=6). Now he has 6 stubs, but after burning 6, he gets 6 stubs again. Wait, no. Because after burning the 4, he had 4+3=7 stubs? Or maybe I'm mixing up the steps.\n\nWait, let's recalculate. Starting with 4:\n\n- Burn 4 → 4 hours, 4 stubs.\n- 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. Burn them → 2 hours, now have 4 + 2 = 6 stubs.\n- 6 / 2 = 3 new candles. Burn → 3 hours, stubs: 6 + 3 = 9.\n- 9 / 2 =4, with 1 leftover. Burn 4 → 4 hours, stubs: 9 +4=13.\n- 13 /2 is 6, with 1 leftover. Burn 6 → 6 hours, stubs:13 +6=19.\n- 19/2=9, rem 1. Burn 9 → 9 hours, stubs:19+9=28.\n- 28/2=14. Burn → 14 hours, stubs 28 +14=42.\nWait, but that seems too high. Wait the sample output is 7 for input 4 2. Hmm, what's wrong here.\n\nOh wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the process. Let's re-examine the note. Oh right! The initial 4 are burned, giving 4 stubs. Then, those 4 make 2 new candles, which burn for 2 hours, adding 2 stubs. So total so far is 4+2=6. Then, he uses the 2+4=6 stubs to make 3 new candles. Burn those 3 → 3 hours, total 6+3=9. Now he has 3 stubs plus the 6 used? No, wait: after making 3, he burns them, so he gains 3 stubs. So the total stubs would be 4 (initial) → after making 2, he uses 4, but the stubs are 4 -4 +2 (from the new candles) → 2? Or perhaps the way to model it is:\n\nEach time you have a certain number of stubs, you can exchange as many as possible into new candles. So the process is:\n\n1. Start with 'a' candles.\n2. Burn them all, adding 'a' stubs to the pile.\n3. While the number of stubs is >= b:\n   a. Make as many new candles as possible (stubs // b).\n   b. Add these to the total hours burned.\n   c. The new stubs are the remainder (stubs % b) plus the new candles burned (because each new candle contributes one stub when burned).\n   \nWait, no. Because when you make new candles from stubs, you burn them, which adds their count to the stubs.\n\nSo the correct way is:\n\nInitialize total_hours = a\ncurrent_stubs = a\n\nThen, while current_stubs >= b:\n    new_candles = current_stubs // b\n    total_hours += new_candles\n    current_stubs = (current_stubs % b) + new_candles\n\nRepeat until current_stubs < b.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo for the first example:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ntotal_hours =4\ncurrent_stubs=4.\n\nLoop:\n\n4 >=2: new=2, total becomes 6. current_stubs=0 +2 =2.\n\nAgain, 2>=2: new=1, total=7. current_stubs=0 +1=1. Now loop ends.\n\nSo total is 7, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: 6 3.\n\nInitial total=6, stubs=6.\n\n6 >=3 → new=2, total=8. stubs=0+2=2. Loop ends.\n\nSo output is 8.\n\nThat aligns with the sample.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read a and b.\n- Initialize total = a, stubs = a.\n- While stubs >=b:\n   new = stubs // b\n   total +=new\n   stubs = (stubs % b) + new\n- Return total.\n\nThis seems straightforward.\n\nNow, thinking about edge cases:\n\nCase 1: a=1, b=2.\n\nHe can't make any new candles. So total is 1.\n\nCase 2: a=5, b=5.\n\nBurn 5 → 5 stubs. Make 1 new. Burn it → 1 hour, stubs=1. Now 1<5. So total 6.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=3.\n\nLet's compute step by step:\n\nStubs=10.\n\n10//3=3, rem 1. So new=3, total=10+3=13. Stubs=1 +3=4.\n\n4 >=3: 4//3=1, rem1. New=1, total=14. Stubs=1+1=2. Now 2<3. So total is 14.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the algorithm seems solid.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nThe code needs to read two integers a and b from input.\n\nWait, the input is given as a single line with two integers, like \"4 2\" or \"6 3\".\n\nSo in Python, we can read the input line, split into a list of strings, then convert each to int.\n\nThen, perform the steps.\n\nSo code outline:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nstubs = a\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new = stubs // b\n    total += new\n    stubs = stubs % b + new\nprint(total)\n\nYes, that should do it.\n\nTesting with sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: 4 2 → 7.\n\nSample 2:6 3 →8.\n\nEdge case a=1, b=2: output 1.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5 →6.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when b=1? Well, according to the constraints, b is at least 2. So no need to handle b=1.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using candles. Each candle burns for one hour and then becomes a stub. Vasily can convert these stubs into new candles, which can then be burned again.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles `a`. Burn all these candles immediately, which gives us `a` hours of light and `a` stubs.\n2. **Conversion Process**: Convert the stubs into new candles as long as the number of stubs is at least `b`. Each conversion yields a certain number of new candles, which are then burned, contributing to the total hours of light and adding more stubs.\n3. **Iterative Conversion**: Continue converting stubs into new candles and burning them until there are not enough stubs left to make another candle (i.e., fewer than `b` stubs remain).\n\nThe algorithm works as follows:\n1. Read the input values `a` and `b`.\n2. Initialize the total hours with the initial number of candles `a`.\n3. Use a loop to repeatedly convert stubs into new candles and update the total hours and stub count until there are not enough stubs to make another candle.\n4. Output the total hours.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nstubs = a\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new = stubs // b\n    total += new\n    stubs = stubs % b + new\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `a` and `b`, which are read and converted into integers.\n- **Initial Setup**: The initial number of candles `a` is burned, giving `a` hours and `a` stubs.\n- **Loop for Conversion**: While the number of stubs is at least `b`, convert the stubs into new candles. Each conversion adds new candles to the total hours and updates the stub count.\n- **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when the number of stubs is less than `b`, meaning no more new candles can be made.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the maximum hours by iteratively converting stubs into new candles and keeping track of the total hours of light.",
