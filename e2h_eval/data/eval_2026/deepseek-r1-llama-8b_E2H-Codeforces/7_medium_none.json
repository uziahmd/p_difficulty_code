The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices.

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine for a given number n whether it's possible to construct a snowflake graph as defined. The snowflake is built in a certain way, and I have to figure out for each test case if such a snowflake exists with exactly n vertices.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nThe snowflake is constructed as follows:\n\n- Start with one vertex.\n- Then, connect this initial vertex to k new vertices (k > 1).\n- Each vertex that has only one edge (so degree 1) must then be connected to k new vertices. And this step must be done at least once.\n\nSo the process is: create a root, connect it to k children. Then, for each of those children, they must each have their own k children. But wait, after the first expansion, any node with degree 1 (like the initial k nodes) must undergo this expansion again.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the second step says that each vertex that has only one edge is connected to k new vertices. So the initial step is step 0: root has degree 0. Then step 1: root connects to k children, now root has degree k, each child has degree 1. Then, step 2: each of those k children must connect to k new nodes, increasing their degree to k+1? Or wait, no. Wait, when you add edges from a vertex to k new nodes, the degree of that vertex increases by k. So in step 1, root has degree k, each child has degree 1. Then in step 2, each of the k children must connect to k new nodes. So each of them adds k edges, thus their degrees become 1 + k = k+1. But wait, each of these new nodes has degree 1, because they're only connected to their parent. So, after step 2, each of the original k children has k new children. So the total number of nodes after step 1 is 1 + k = k+1. After step 2, the total is 1 + k + k*k.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that this step (step 2) should be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake is when step 2 is done once. So for the minimal case, the structure is a root with k children, each of whom has k children. So the total nodes would be 1 + k + k^2.\n\nWait, but maybe step 2 is done multiple times. Like, after step 2, each of those nodes now has degree 1 (because they only connected to their parent), so step 2 can be done again. So perhaps the snowflake can have varying depths, but each time a node has degree 1, it must branch into k children. So the structure is a tree where every non-leaf node has exactly k children, except the root which has k children in the first step, and then each node in the next level has k children, etc., but each node must have at least two layers beyond the root. Because the initial expansion is step 1, and then step 2 is done at least once.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to model the number of nodes in the snowflake as a function of k and the number of steps beyond the initial step.\n\nWait, the snowflake is a rooted tree where each internal node has exactly k children. The root has degree k, and all other internal nodes have degree k as well. The leaves are the nodes that have been added in the last step.\n\nWait, but the process starts with the root having k children. Then each of those children must themselves have k children, and this must be done at least once. So the minimal depth is 2, meaning the root is at level 0, its children are level 1, their children are level 2.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 (root) + k (level 1) + k^2 (level 2) + ... up to some depth m, where m >= 2.\n\nWait, no. Because after step 1, the root has k children. Then step 2 is applied to each of those k children, adding k^2 nodes. But then, since each of those new nodes is a leaf (degree 1), step 2 is applied again. So perhaps step 2 is applied multiple times.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe process is:\n\n- Start with 1 node.\n\n- Add k new nodes connected to the root. Now, the root has k children.\n\n- Then, each vertex that has only one edge (i.e., the k new nodes) must be connected to k new nodes. This step is done at least once.\n\nWait, so after step 1, the k nodes have degree 1. So step 2 must be done at least once. So each of these k nodes must add k children. So after step 2, each has k children, making them have degree k+1 (since they were connected to the root). Then, those new nodes (the ones added in step 2) are now leaves, but the existing k nodes are internal nodes with degree k+1. Do we have to do step 2 again on those nodes?\n\nWait, according to the problem statement, step 2 is done at least once. So step 2 is applied to all current leaves, which are the ones added in step 2. So after step 2, each of those leaves has degree 1, so step 2 must be done again.\n\nSo step 2 is applied recursively until all leaves have been processed, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process is that step 2 is applied exactly once to each node that was created in step 1. Because after step 1, the root has k children, each of which is a leaf. Then step 2 is applied to each of those, adding k children to each. Now, each of those k children has degree 1, but step 2 is not applied again unless specified. Wait, no. The problem says that step 2 should be done at least once. So step 2 is applied once, but then the resulting nodes are leaves, but step 2 is applied again if necessary.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nEach vertex that is connected by only one edge is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nInitially, the root is connected to k nodes.\n\nThen, for every node that has degree 1, they must be connected to k new nodes. And this step is done at least once.\n\nSo the initial step creates the root and the first layer. Then, step 2 is done at least once, so each node in the first layer (which are leaves) must generate k new nodes. Then, after that, any new leaves (from step 2) may also have to undergo step 2 if it's done more than once.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the step is done at least once. So the step is applied once, but can it be applied again for any new leaves?\n\nFor example, after the initial step 2, each of the first layer's nodes has k children. Those children are leaves (degree 1). Are they required to undergo step 2 again? Because the problem says that the step should be done at least once, but nothing about doing it more than once. So perhaps step 2 is done once, and then the process stops.\n\nWait, the problem says that the step should be done at least once. So step 2 can be done more than once, but must be done at least once. So the minimal case is step 2 being done once.\n\nSo the snowflake is built as follows:\n\n- Root: 1 node.\n\n- Step 1: root connects to k nodes. Now, total nodes: 1 + k.\n\n- Step 2: each of the k nodes (each has degree 1) must connect to k new nodes. So each adds k nodes, so total becomes 1 + k + k^2.\n\nNow, after step 2, each of these new nodes has degree 1. But the problem doesn't require further steps beyond step 2, because the step is done at least once. So the minimal snowflake is 1 + k + k².\n\nBut what if step 2 is done more than once? For instance, after step 2, the k² nodes are leaves. So step 2 could be done again, each of them adding k new nodes, leading to 1 + k + k² + k³, etc. So the total number of nodes is a sum of a geometric series: 1 + k*(1 + k + k² + ... + k^{m}), where m is the number of times step 2 is applied beyond the first.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nAfter step 2, each node in the first layer has k children. So the structure is a perfect k-ary tree of depth m, starting from the root.\n\nWait, the root is depth 0, its children are depth 1, their children are depth 2, and so on. But the process requires that the tree has at least two levels beyond the root, because step 2 is done at least once. So the minimal depth is 2.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is the sum from i=0 to m of k^i, but with m >= 2. Wait, no. Because the initial step is step 1, which adds k nodes (depth 1), and then step 2 adds k² nodes (depth 2). So the total is 1 + k + k². If step 2 is done again, each of the k² nodes adds k children, adding k^3 nodes, making the total 1 + k + k² + k³, and so on.\n\nWait, but in that case, the structure is a full k-ary tree of height m, where m >= 2.\n\nWait, a full k-ary tree of height h has 1 + k + k² + ... + k^h nodes. So for our problem, the total n must be equal to 1 + k*(sum_{i=0}^{m-1} k^i), where m is the number of steps after the initial step 1. Because step 2 is applied m times, each time expanding each leaf.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nIn the initial step, the root (depth 0) has k children (depth 1). Then, step 2 is applied, which adds k children to each of the depth 1 nodes, creating depth 2 nodes. That's one application of step 2.\n\nIf step 2 is applied again, each depth 2 node adds k children, creating depth 3 nodes. So each application of step 2 increases the depth by 1.\n\nThe problem requires that step 2 is done at least once, so the minimal depth is 2.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is the sum of the series for a full k-ary tree up to depth m, where m is at least 2.\n\nWait, no. Because in our case, the initial step is the root (1 node), then step 1 adds k nodes (depth 1). Then step 2 is applied, which adds k² nodes (depth 2). So the total is 1 + k + k².\n\nIf step 2 is applied again, each of the k² nodes adds k children, adding k³ nodes, making the total 1 + k + k² + k³.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 + k*(1 + k + k² + ... +k^{m}), where m is the number of times step 2 is applied beyond the initial step.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial step 2 adds k² nodes, which is k^2. Then step 2 applied again adds k^3, and so on.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k² + k³ + ... + k^d, where d is the depth, which is at least 2.\n\nWait, yes. Because the initial root is 1 node, then step 1 adds k, step 2 adds k², step 3 adds k³, etc. So the total is the sum of a geometric series where each term is k^i, starting from i=0 to i=d, where d >= 2.\n\nBecause for d=0, it's just 1 node, which isn't allowed. For d=1, it's 1 + k nodes, but step 2 hasn't been done yet, so it's invalid. So the minimal d is 2.\n\nSo the condition is that n must be equal to (k^(d+1) - 1)/(k-1), where d >= 2, and k>1.\n\nSo our task is, given n, check whether there exists integers k>1 and d>=2 such that n = (k^(d+1) -1)/(k-1).\n\nWait, but wait: the sum 1 + k + k² + ... +k^d = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo for each n, we need to determine if it can be written in the form S = (k^{m} -1)/(k-1), where m >=3 (since d >=2 implies m = d+1 >=3), and k>1.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: given n, does there exist k>1 and m>=3 such that n = (k^m -1)/(k-1).\n\nWe need to check for all possible k and m, but since n can be up to 1e18, we need an efficient way.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, note that for a given m, the equation n = S, where S is the sum of a geometric series of m terms, each term being k^i for i from 0 to m-1.\n\nBut wait, the sum S for m terms (from i=0 to m-1) is (k^m -1)/(k-1). So for each possible m >=3, we can try to find a k>1 such that n equals S.\n\nThe idea is to iterate over possible values of m (starting from 3 up to log_2(n)+1) and see if for any m, there exists a k>1 that satisfies the equation.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, the maximum possible m is up to log_2(1e18) which is around 60. So for each test case, we can try m from 3 up to 60 and see.\n\nFor each m, we can compute possible k.\n\nHow?\n\nWe can treat the equation n = (k^m -1)/(k-1) as a function of k, and for each m, perform a binary search on k to see if any integer k>1 satisfies the equation.\n\nAlternatively, since for fixed m, the function S(k) increases as k increases, we can binary search k in [2, n] for each m.\n\nBut for each m, the maximum possible k is such that S(k) <=n.\n\nWait, but for each m, the minimal k is 2. Let's see:\n\nFor m=3, S(k) = 1 +k +k². We can set this equal to n and solve for k.\n\nSimilarly for higher m.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n   if n < 3: output NO (since minimal is 1+2+4=7, but wait no: wait, for m=2, S(k) = 1+k +k². For k=2, m=2 gives S=1+2+4=7. So for n=7, it's YES.)\n\nWait, no: for the snowflake, the minimal is when step 2 is done once, which gives m=2. So for n=7, which is 1+2+4=7, it's a valid snowflake.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought about the minimal case, I thought that the minimal is when step 2 is done once, which gives 1 +k +k² nodes.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me get back.\n\nEarlier, I thought that the snowflake requires the tree to have depth at least 2. So for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nBut in the problem statement, the minimal snowflake for k=4 is shown as a figure. Let me see, the sample input shows n=6 as 'NO' and n=13 as 'YES'.\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nInput:\n9\n1\n2\n3\n6\n13\n15\n255\n10101\n1000000000000000000\n\nOutput:\nNO\nNO\nNO\nNO\nYES\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\n\nSo for n=6, output is NO. Let's see: 6 can be written as 1 + 2 + 3? No. Wait, 1+2+3=6, but k must be same for all terms. So 1 +k +k² =6 → k² +k +1=6 → k² +k -5=0. Discriminant is 1+20=21, which is not a square. So no integer solution. So n=6 is NO.\n\nFor n=13: 13=1+3+9 → k=2, m=2. So 13 is YES.\n\nWait, 1+3+9=13 → yes.\n\nSo for n=13, m=2, k=3: (3^3-1)/(3-1) = (27-1)/2=26/2=13.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the sum for m=2 is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo for each test case, n can be written as (k^{m} -1)/(k-1), where m >=2, and k>1.\n\nWait, no. Because for m=2, it's 1 +k +k².\n\nWait, no: m is the exponent in the formula. So the sum is 1 +k +k² +...+k^{m-1} = (k^m -1)/(k-1). So for m=2, the sum is 1 +k. For m=3, it's 1 +k +k², etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nThe sum S(m, k) is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m-1} = (k^m -1)/(k-1).\n\nSo for a snowflake, the sum must be S(m, k), where m >=2, because the minimal m is 2.\n\nWait, no: in the problem statement, the step 2 is done at least once, which corresponds to adding the second layer of nodes. So the minimal structure is m=2.\n\nThus, for the problem, we need to find if n is equal to S(m, k) for some m >=2 and k>1.\n\nSo the task is: for each n, check if there exists m >=2 and k>1 such that n = S(m, k).\n\nNow, for each n, we can iterate m from 2 up to log_2(n) +1, and for each m, see if n can be expressed as S(m, k) for some integer k>1.\n\nGiven that n can be up to 1e18, the maximum possible m is up to 60 (since 2^60 is about 1e18). So for each test case, we can loop m from 2 to 60, and for each m, perform a binary search for k in [2, n^(1/(m-1)))].\n\nWait, because for a given m, the equation is n = (k^m -1)/(k-1). We can rearrange this to find an approximate upper bound for k.\n\nAlternatively, for each m, we can compute the maximum possible k such that S(m, k) <=n.\n\nBut for each m, the minimal k is 2, and the maximal possible k can be found as follows: for m >=2, S(m, k) increases as k increases.\n\nSo for each m, the maximum possible k is such that S(m, k) <=n.\n\nWe can compute this maximum k using binary search.\n\nOnce we have that, for each m, we can check if any k in [2, max_k] satisfies S(m, k)=n.\n\nBut calculating S(m, k) for large k and m can lead to very large numbers, so we have to handle potential overflows.\n\nBut since n is up to 1e18, and m is up to 60, for each m, the maximum possible k is up to n^(1/(m)).\n\nWait, for example, for m=2, the maximum possible k is sqrt(n). Because S(2, k) = k+1 = n → k ~ n.\n\nBut for larger m, k will be smaller.\n\nSo for each m, the binary search for k can be done efficiently.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n   if n < 3: output NO (since the minimal is 7 for m=2, k=2 → 1+2+4=7)\n\n   else:\n\n      for m in 2 to 60:\n\n          compute the maximum possible k such that S(m, k) <=n.\n\n          perform a binary search for k in [2, ... , upper_bound].\n\n          for each candidate k, compute S(m, k). If any S(m, k) equals n, return YES.\n\n      if none found, output NO.\n\nBut how to compute S(m, k)?\n\nWe can compute S(m, k) iteratively, but for large m and k, this can cause overflows. So we need to compute it in a way that avoids overflow.\n\nAn alternative is to compute S(m, k) while checking for overflow. If at any point the intermediate sum exceeds n, we can break early and consider that k is too large.\n\nSo here's the plan for each m and k:\n\nCompute S(m, k) as 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m-1}.\n\nWe can compute this incrementally, adding each term and checking for overflow.\n\nLet's implement a helper function that, given m and k, computes S(m, k) and returns whether it equals n, or returns None if it's less than or greater than n.\n\nWait, but for each m, we can compute the maximum possible k such that S(m, k) <=n.\n\nBut to find if any k exists where S(m, k) =n, we can proceed as follows:\n\nLoop m from 2 to 60:\n\n   low = 2\n\n   high = some upper limit (like 1e9, but probably much lower)\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n       mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n       compute s = S(m, mid)\n\n       if s ==n: return YES\n\n       elif s <n: low = mid +1\n\n       else: high = mid -1\n\n   end while\n\nend loop\n\nIf after all m, no match, return NO.\n\nBut computing S(m, mid) can be done as follows:\n\ndef compute_S(m, k):\n\n    s = 0\n\n    current_term = 1\n\n    for i in range(m):\n\n        s += current_term\n\n        if s > n:  # since n is known, and for each test case, n is fixed\n\n            return s\n\n        current_term *= k\n\n    return s\n\nBut wait, for m=2, this is 1 +k.\n\nBut for larger m, like m=3, it's 1 +k +k².\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nBut for large m, say m=60, and k=2, S(m, 2) is 2^60 -1, which is around 1e18, which is within the constraints.\n\nBut for k=2 and m=60, 2^60 is about 1e18, which is manageable.\n\nSo the helper function can compute S(m, k) step by step, and if during the computation, s exceeds n, it can return early.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for each test case, n is given. So for each test case, during the computation of S(m, k), we can compare with n.\n\nSo the code outline is:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each test case:\n\n   n = ... \n\n   if n < 3: print NO.\n\n   else:\n\n       flag = False\n\n       for m in 2 to 60:\n\n           low = 2\n\n           high = 1e18^(1/(m-1)). Maybe 1e9 is enough for m=2.\n\n           while low <= high:\n\n               mid = (low + high) //2\n\n               s = 0\n\n               current = 1\n\n               for i in range(m):\n\n                   s += current\n\n                   if s > n:\n\n                       break\n\n                   current *= mid\n\n               if s >n:\n\n                   high = mid -1\n\n               elif s <n:\n\n                   low = mid +1\n\n               else:\n\n                   flag = True\n\n                   break\n\n           if flag:\n\n               break\n\n       print(\"YES\" if flag else \"NO\")\n\nBut wait, for m=2, S(m, k)=1 +k.\n\nSo for m=2, the equation is 1 +k =n → k =n-1.\n\nWhich is only valid if n-1 >=2, so n >=3.\n\nSo for n=3, 1+2=3 → YES.\n\nBut according to the sample input, for n=3, the output is NO.\n\nWait, sample input includes 3 as 'NO'. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's see: sample input's third case is 3.\n\nSample output is 'NO'.\n\nWait, why? Because for m=2, S(2,2)=1+2=3, which equals n=3. So why is the output 'NO'?\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says that the snowflake is constructed as follows:\n\nInitially, the graph has one vertex.\n\nThen, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected to k>1 new vertices.\n\nThen, each vertex connected by only one edge is connected to k new vertices. This step is done at least once.\n\nWait, so the initial step is step 1: root connects to k nodes.\n\nStep 2: each of those k nodes connects to k new nodes. So the minimal snowflake is 1 +k +k².\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier.\n\nSo perhaps the snowflake is a tree where the root has k children, each of those has k children, and so on, for at least two levels beyond the root.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^d, where d >=2.\n\nSo for the snowflake, the sum is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^d, with d >=2.\n\nSo for m=2, it's 1 +k +k².\n\nWait, no. Wait, for d=2, it's 1 +k +k².\n\nFor d=3, it's 1 +k +k² +k^3.\n\nSo the sum is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^d.\n\nThus, the equation is n = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1), where d >=1.\n\nWait, no: wait, the sum from i=0 to d is (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nSo for d=1, sum is 1 +k.\n\nFor d=2, sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo the minimal d is 2, so the minimal sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo for the snowflake, the sum must be at least 1 +k +k², where k>1.\n\nSo for n=3, which is 1+2, it's not sufficient because d must be at least 2, so the minimal sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo for n=3, the minimal sum would be 1+2+4=7. So n=3 is less than that, so it's impossible. Hence the sample output is 'NO'.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, n=6 is also 'NO'.\n\nWait, n=6: can it be written as 1 +k +k²?\n\n1 +k +k² =6 → k² +k -5=0 → roots are (-1 ± sqrt(21))/2 → about 1.79, which is not integer. So no solution.\n\nSo n=6 is 'NO'.\n\nSo the minimal sum is 1 +k +k², which for k=2 is 7. So for n=7, it's YES.\n\nIn the sample input, n=13 is 1+3+9=13 → YES.\n\nn=15: 1+2+4+8=15 → m=3, k=2. So 15 is YES.\n\nn=255: 255 is 2^8-1 = (2^8 -1)/(2-1) → m=8, k=2. So yes.\n\nn=10101: let's see if it can be expressed as (k^m -1)/(k-1) for some m>=3 and k>1.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to code.\n\nSo the correction to my earlier approach is that the minimal sum is 1 +k +k², which is the case when d=2.\n\nSo the equation is n = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1), where d >=1, but wait, no.\n\nWait, for d=2, the sum is 1 +k +k² = (k^3-1)/(k-1).\n\nSo for the snowflake, the sum must be at least (k^3-1)/(k-1), which is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo the sum is S = (k^{m} -1)/(k-1), where m >=3.\n\nBecause d+1 =m.\n\nSo for the snowflake, m must be >=3.\n\nSo the previous approach was incorrect; I thought m could be 2, but actually m must be >=3.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point.\n\nSo the sum is S = (k^m -1)/(k-1), where m >=3.\n\nThus, for each test case n, we need to check if there exists m >=3 and k>1 such that n = S.\n\nSo for n=7, m=3, k=2: S=1+2+4=7 → yes.\n\nSo the correct approach is to loop m from 3 to 60, and for each m, perform a binary search for k in [2, ... ] to see if S(m, k) equals n.\n\nSo the revised plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n   if n <7: output NO.\n\n   else:\n\n       for m in 3 to 60:\n\n           perform binary search for k in [2, ... , upper_bound]\n\n           for each candidate k, compute S(m, k). If any equals n, output YES.\n\n       if no such m and k, output NO.\n\nSo the sample input:\n\nn=9: is 9 equal to any S(m, k) for m>=3.\n\nCheck m=3: S=1 +k +k²=9 → k² +k -8=0 →k=( -1 + sqrt(33))/2 ≈2.74 → no integer.\n\nm=4: 1 +k +k² +k³=9.\n\nTry k=2: 1+2+4+8=15>9.\n\nk=1: not allowed.\n\nNo solution.\n\nm=3: no solution.\n\nm=4: no solution.\n\nm=5: 1 +k +k² +k³ +k^4=9.\n\nk=2: 31>9.\n\nNo.\n\nSo n=9 is 'NO'.\n\nAnother sample input: n=255.\n\nFor m=8, k=2: 1+2+4+...+128 =255.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code needs to correctly handle this.\n\nSo now, the code outline is:\n\nRead t.\n\nFor each test case:\n\n   Read n.\n\n   if n <7: print NO.\n\n   else:\n\n       flag = False\n\n       for m in 3 to 60:\n\n           low =2\n\n           high = ?\n\n           Compute the maximum possible k for this m.\n\n           How?\n\n           Since S(m, k) increases with k, for a given m, the maximum possible k is when S(m, k) =n.\n\n           But for m, the minimal k is 2, and the maximum k is such that S(m, 2) <=n.\n\n           Wait, but S(m, 2) is 2^m -1.\n\n           So for each m, if 2^m -1 >n, then even for k=2, S(m, 2) >n, so no solution for this m.\n\n           So for a given m, the maximum possible k is min( something ), but perhaps it's better to set high as the minimal between (n) and 1e9 or something.\n\n           Alternatively, for each m, the maximum possible k is such that S(m, k) <=n.\n\n           But to avoid overcomplicating, in the binary search, high can be set as 1e9 initially.\n\n           But for efficiency, perhaps calculate the maximum possible k for each m.\n\n           Let me think: for a given m, what's the maximum possible k.\n\n           The sum S(m, k) =1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m-1}.\n\n           For k=2, S(m, 2) = 2^m -1.\n\n           So for a given m, if 2^m -1 >n, then no solution for this m.\n\n           Else, proceed to binary search.\n\n           So for each m in 3 to 60:\n\n               compute max_k_m = floor((n)^(1/(m-1))) )\n\n               but perhaps that's not necessary. Let's proceed with binary search.\n\n           So for each m:\n\n               low =2\n\n               high = 2e9 (or a higher number, but in practice, for small m, high can be much larger)\n\n               while low <=high:\n\n                   mid = (low + high)//2\n\n                   compute s = S(m, mid)\n\n                   if s ==n:\n\n                       flag=True → break everything.\n\n                   elif s <n:\n\n                       low =mid +1\n\n                   else:\n\n                       high =mid -1\n\n               end loop\n\n           end for m.\n\n       if flag: print YES else NO.\n\nSo the helper function to compute S(m, k) is essential.\n\nImplementing this function correctly is key.\n\nSo, in Python, for each m and k, compute the sum step by step, adding each term and checking for overflow against n.\n\nNow, let's think about the helper function.\n\nFunction compute_S(m, k, n):\n\n   sum_so_far =0\n\n   current_term =1\n\n   for i in range(m):\n\n       sum_so_far += current_term\n\n       if sum_so_far >n:\n\n           return sum_so_far\n\n       current_term *=k\n\n   return sum_so_far\n\nSo for each m and k, this function returns the sum. If during the computation, the sum exceeds n, it returns early.\n\nThis should work.\n\nNow, let's see for n=7:\n\nm=3, k=2.\n\nsum is 1+2+4=7 → equals n → return YES.\n\nSo the code would find this.\n\nFor n=6: trying m=3, k=2: sum is 1+2+4=7>6 → no.\n\nSo no solution.\n\nSo the code should correctly handle the sample inputs.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nTest case 1: n=7 → YES.\n\nTest case 2: n=8.\n\nCheck for m=3:\n\nS=1+2+4=7 <8.\n\nk=3: 1+3+9=13>8.\n\nNo solution.\n\nm=4:\n\nS=1+2+4+8=15>8.\n\nk=2.\n\nNo solution.\n\nm=3, k=2: sum is 7<8.\n\nWhat about m=3, k=2: sum is 7, which is less than 8.\n\nIs there a k>2 for m=3 that gives sum=8?\n\n1 +k +k²=8 →k² +k -7=0 →k≈2.645 → not integer.\n\nNo.\n\nSo n=8 is NO.\n\nAnother case: n=15.\n\nCheck for m=3, k=2: sum is 7 <15.\n\nk=3: 1+3+9=13 <15.\n\nk=4: 1+4+16=21>15.\n\nNo.\n\nm=4: 1+2+4+8=15 → yes.\n\nSo n=15 is YES.\n\nAnother case: n=1.\n\nIt's less than 7, so output NO.\n\nAnother case: n=1e18.\n\nCheck if it can be expressed as S(m, k).\n\nFor m=60, k=2: sum is 2^60 -1/(2-1) → 2^60-1= 1,152,921,504,606,846,975 → which is about 1e18.\n\nSo n=1e18 is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000.\n\nWhich is less than 2^60-1.\n\nSo for m=59:\n\nWhat's the sum S(59, 2): 2^59 -1.\n\nWhich is 576460752303423487.\n\nWhich is about 5.76e17, less than 1e18.\n\nSo for m=59, k=2: sum is 5.76e17.\n\nWhich is less than 1e18.\n\nFor m=60, k=",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by the problem. The snowflake graph is constructed in a specific way where each vertex with only one edge must connect to \\( k \\) new vertices, and this process is done at least once after the initial setup.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The snowflake graph is a rooted tree where each internal node has exactly \\( k \\) children. The minimal structure has three levels: the root, its immediate children, and their children. This means the total number of nodes \\( n \\) must be expressible as a sum of a geometric series of the form \\( 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{m-1} \\) for some integers \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( m \\geq 3 \\).\n\n2. **Geometric Series Sum**: For each possible depth \\( m \\) starting from 3 up to 60 (since \\( 2^{60} \\) is slightly more than \\( 10^{18} \\)), we check if there exists an integer \\( k > 1 \\) such that the sum of the series equals \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Binary Search for \\( k \\)**: For each depth \\( m \\), we perform a binary search to find a suitable \\( k \\) such that the sum of the geometric series equals \\( n \\). This involves calculating the sum incrementally and checking for overflow against \\( n \\).\n\n4. **Efficiency Considerations**: Given the constraints, iterating over possible depths \\( m \\) from 3 to 60 and performing a binary search for \\( k \\) ensures the solution is efficient even for large values of \\( n \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_S(m, k, n):\n    sum_so_far = 0\n    current_term = 1\n    for i in range(m):\n        sum_so_far += current_term\n        if sum_so_far > n:\n            return sum_so_far\n        current_term *= k\n        if current_term > n and i < m -1:\n            return n + 1\n    return sum_so_far\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n < 7:\n        return False\n    for m in range(3, 61):\n        low = 2\n        high = 10**18\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            s = compute_S(m, mid, n)\n            if s == n:\n                return True\n            elif s < n:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    for i in range(1, t+1):\n        n = int(input[i])\n        if is_snowflake(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the potentially large number of test cases.\n- **Compute Snowflake Check**: The function `is_snowflake` iterates over possible depths \\( m \\) and uses binary search to find a suitable \\( k \\) for each depth.\n- **Helper Function**: `compute_S` calculates the sum of the geometric series incrementally to avoid overflow and efficiently check if the sum matches \\( n \\).\n- **Output Results**: For each test case, the result is determined and printed as \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check each possible configuration of the snowflake graph without unnecessary computations, making it suitable for very large values of \\( n \\).",
