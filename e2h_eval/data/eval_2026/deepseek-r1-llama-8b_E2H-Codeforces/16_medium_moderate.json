Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a plane with n infinite line roads. Each road is given by an equation aix + biy + ci = 0. These roads divide the plane into blocks, and moving from one block to another requires crossing a border of non-zero length. The task is to find the minimum number of steps needed to get from the home block to the university block.\n\nHmm. So each step is moving across a single road's boundary. But wait, how do we model this? It seems like each road can act as a kind of barrier that you have to cross when moving between certain blocks.\n\nWait, but how are the blocks structured? Since all lines are straight, the arrangement could create regions where each region is separated by some combination of these lines. But thinking in terms of planar graphs might help, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about what determines whether two points are in the same block or different. Each road is a line, and the home and university are not on any road. So for each road, we can determine on which side of the road the home and university lie.\n\nBut how does this affect their connectivity through the roads? Because each time you cross a road, you switch sides. So if two points are on the same side of every road, they are in the same block. Otherwise, the number of roads that separate them will determine the minimal steps needed.\n\nWait a minute! Oh right, because each step is crossing exactly one road. So the minimal number of steps required is equal to the number of roads that separate the home and the university. Because for each such road, you have to cross it once.\n\nSo the key insight here is that each separating road contributes one step. So the answer is simply the count of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides of the road.\n\nThat's a really clever observation. So the problem reduces to counting how many roads have the home and university on different sides.\n\nSo the steps to solve the problem would be:\n\n1. For each road, compute the value of a*x + b*y + c for the home and university.\n2. If the signs of these two values are different, then the home and university are on opposite sides of the road, so this road separates them. Increment the count.\n3. The minimal number of steps is this count.\n\nBecause each such road must be crossed once. Because each step allows crossing one road, and the order doesn't matter—it's just the count.\n\nSo the approach is straightforward. Now, the challenge is implementing this correctly, considering possible edge cases.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the home and university are already on the same side for all roads? Then the answer is zero, meaning they are already in the same block.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n- Read home coordinates (x1, y1).\n- Read university coordinates (x2, y2).\n- Read n, the number of roads.\n- For each road, read a, b, c.\n- Compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c.\n- Compute s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n- If s1 and s2 have opposite signs (i.e., s1 * s2 < 0), then increment the count.\n- After processing all roads, output the count.\n\nThat's it!\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\nHome: 1 1\nUniversity: -1 -1\nn=2\nRoad 1: 0 1 0 → equation y=0. Home is at (1,1) which is above, university is (-1,-1) which is below. So s1 = 0*1+1*1+0=1 >0, s2=0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0=-1 <0 → opposite signs. So count +=1.\n\nRoad 2: 1 0 0 → equation x=0. Home is at (1,1) to the right, university (-1,-1) to the left. So s1=1*1 +0*1 +0=1>0, s2=1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0= -1 <0 → opposite signs. So count +=1.\n\nTotal count is 2, so output is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: suppose home and university are on the same side of all roads. Then count is zero.\n\nWhat about a road where both are on the same side? They don't contribute to the count.\n\nWhat about roads where the home and university are on the same side, but other roads have them on opposite sides?\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code should correctly compute the sign for each road and count how many times they differ.\n\nNow, in Python, handling large numbers isn't an issue since the constraints are manageable.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Overflow? But in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem.\n\n- What about when a, b, c are very large, leading to s1 and s2 being extremely big? Well, as long as we're using floating points, but since the sign is what matters, perhaps using integer arithmetic is sufficient. However, in practice, using floating points could lead to precision issues. Wait, but a, b, c are integers, and x and y are also integers. So a*x + b*y + c is always an integer. So using integers is better.\n\nWait, but for each road, s1 and s2 are computed as integers. So s1*s2 will be negative only if one is positive and the other is negative.\n\nSo, the condition is s1 * s2 < 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in code:\n\ncount = 0\nfor each road in roads:\n    a, b, c = road\n    s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if s1 * s2 < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but wait: what if s1 or s2 is zero? But the problem statement says that neither home nor university lie on any road. So s1 and s2 cannot be zero. So that's okay.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, in Python, how to read the input? The first two lines are home and university. The third line is n. Then n lines follow, each with three integers.\n\nSo the code structure is:\n\nRead x1, y1 from input.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each as a, b, c.\n\nCompute for each a, b, c, s1 and s2, check if s1*s2 <0.\n\nCount those.\n\nOutput the count.\n\nSo in code:\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if s1 * s2 < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but wait—what about the possibility that s1 and s2 are both zero? The problem statement says that home and university are not on any road, so s1 and s2 can't be zero. So the condition s1*s2 <0 is safe.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n1 1\n-1 -1\n2\n0 1 0 → s1=1, s2=-1 → product is negative → count=1\n1 0 0 → s1=1, s2=-1 → product negative → count=2\n\nOutput is 2.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSuppose home is (2,2), university is (3,3). Roads are x+y=5. So for this road, s1=2+2-5= -1, s2=3+3-5=1. Product is negative. So count is 1.\n\nSo the output is 1.\n\nAnother case: home and university are on the same side of all roads. So count is zero.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nI think this should handle all cases. So the code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step allows moving across a single road boundary.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each road can be considered as a line dividing the plane into two regions. If you and the university are on opposite sides of a road, it means you must cross that road exactly once. Thus, the minimum number of steps required is equal to the number of such roads.\n\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads.\n2. **Road Evaluation**: For each road, compute the value of the line equation at the home and university coordinates. This helps determine on which side of the road each point lies.\n3. **Count Separating Roads**: For each road, if the home and university lie on opposite sides (i.e., their computed values have opposite signs), increment the count of separating roads.\n4. **Output Result**: The count of such roads gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if s1 * s2 < 0:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Inputs**: The home and university coordinates are read first, followed by the number of roads.\n2. **Evaluating Each Road**: For each road, defined by the equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\), we compute the values \\(s1\\) and \\(s2\\) for the home and university respectively. These values indicate which side of the road each point is on.\n3. **Determining Opposite Sides**: If \\(s1\\) and \\(s2\\) have opposite signs, it means the home and university are on different sides of the road, and thus this road needs to be crossed.\n4. **Counting Crossings**: Each such road crossing is counted, and the total count is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their signs, ensuring an optimal solution.",
