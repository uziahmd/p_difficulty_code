Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to check if the pile of letters can exactly form the two names given. Hmm, right.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again. Oh right, the input consists of three lines: guest's name, host's name, and the pile. We need to check if the pile is a rearrangement of all the letters from both names combined, without any extra letters.\n\nSo, the approach here is probably to count the frequency of each letter in the guest and host names, combine them, and then compare with the pile's letter counts.\n\nWait, yes. So steps:\n\n1. Read the three input lines.\n2. Concatenate the first two strings (guest + host) into one string.\n3. Also, create a concatenated string of the pile.\n4. For each string (the combined guest+host and the pile), count the frequency of each character.\n5. Compare these two frequency dictionaries. If they are identical, output YES; else, NO.\n\nBut wait, what about case sensitivity? The problem says all letters are uppercase, so we don't have to worry about lowercase. Great.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nI think using the collections.Counter class would be helpful here. Because it can count the occurrences of each character efficiently.\n\nSo, plan:\n\n- Read the three lines. Let's call them guest, host, pile.\n- Combine guest and host into combined = guest + host.\n- Then, create a Counter for combined.\n- Create another Counter for pile.\n- Compare the two Counters. If they are equal, output YES; else, NO.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nBut wait, what about when the lengths don't match? Because if the total number of letters in combined is different from the pile, then the Counters will automatically differ. So, the code will handle that.\n\nSo, let's see some examples.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS\nHost: DEDMOROZ\nPile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\n\nThe length of guest is 10 letters, host is 8 letters, so combined is 18 letters.\n\nPile is 20 letters? Wait, no, wait. Let me check the sample input description. Wait, the third line is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'—let me count the letters.\n\nWait, perhaps I should not get stuck on that. Let's just proceed.\n\nAnother example: second sample.\n\nGuest is PAPAINOEL, which is 8 letters, host is JOULUPUKKI (10 letters). Combined is 18 letters.\n\nPile is BABONATALE (9 letters?), FATHERCHRISTMAS (15?), BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER—wait, but the problem says the output is NO because there's a missing P and extra L. So the combined has 18 letters, pile is 25 letters. So the counters won't match.\n\nSo, the code should correctly handle all these cases.\n\nPotential issues to consider:\n\n- What if the guest or host names have zero letters? But the problem states that all lines are not empty, so no problem.\n- All letters are uppercase, so no case issues.\n- Time constraints: Since the maximum length is 100 per line, combined can be up to 200 letters. Creating Counters for each is O(n), which is acceptable.\n\nSo, now, coding.\n\nRead the three lines:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, combined = guest + host.\n\nCreate counters:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ncounter_combined = Counter(combined)\ncounter_pile = Counter(pile)\n\nIf counter_combined == counter_pile, print YES, else NO.\n\nThat's simple enough.\n\nWait, but wait: what about the possibility that the guest or host names have more letters than the pile? Well, the Counter will capture that because their counts would differ.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS → let's see, S A N T A C L A U S → 10 letters?\nWait, let me count: S(1), A(3), N(2), T(1), C(1), L(1), U(1). Wait, wait SANTACLAUS is spelled as S A N T A C L A U S → that's 10 letters? Or maybe I'm wrong, but perhaps it's better to rely on the code.\n\nSimilarly for other parts.\n\nBut the code should correctly process that.\n\nAnother edge case: all letters are same. Like guest is \"AAAA\", host is \"AAAA\", pile is \"AAAAAAAAA\". Then, combined has 8 A's, pile has 9 → output NO.\n\nAnother case: guest and host together have exactly the same letters as pile, but",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the pile of letters found at the door can be rearranged to form both the guest's name and the host's name exactly. This means that the pile must contain exactly the same number of each letter as the combined names of the guest and host without any extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** We read three lines from the input: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names:** Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Count Letters:** Use a counter to count the frequency of each letter in the combined string of the guest and host names.\n4. **Compare with Pile:** Similarly, count the frequency of each letter in the pile string.\n5. **Check Equality:** Compare the two counters. If they are equal, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the exact match of letter frequencies, which is crucial for determining if the pile can be rearranged to form the names.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Read the three input lines\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\n# Combine the guest and host names\ncombined = guest + host\n\n# Count the letters in the combined string and the pile\ncounter_combined = Counter(combined)\ncounter_pile = Counter(pile)\n\n# Check if the counters are equal\nif counter_combined == counter_pile:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The input consists of three strings, each representing the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters respectively.\n- **Combining Names:** By concatenating the guest's and host's names, we get a single string that represents all the letters that should be present in the pile.\n- **Counting Letters:** Using `collections.Counter`, we create a frequency count of each letter in both the combined names and the pile. This helps in efficiently comparing the two sets of letters.\n- **Comparison:** If the two counters (from the combined names and the pile) are identical, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the names exactly, hence printing \"YES\". Otherwise, we print \"NO\".\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem constraints and ensures correctness by leveraging the properties of frequency counters.",
