His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about an Olympiad where participants' results from two tours are given. But the problem is that the teacher only has the points for each tour, not which participant got which. The teacher knows that Vasya's total (sum of his two scores) is at least x. We need to find the best and worst possible places Vasya could have gotten.\n\nHmm. So, the key here is to figure out all possible ways to pair the a_i and b_j such that their sum is at least x, and then determine the best and worst possible rankings he could have.\n\nWait, but how? Because the participants are in a sorted list based on their total points. And if multiple people have the same total, the jury can arrange them in any order, which affects their ranking.\n\nSo the approach is to compute all possible pairs of a and b for Vasya, ensuring that the sum is >=x. Then, for each possible pair (a_i + b_j), we need to see how many participants have a higher sum, and how many have the same sum but could potentially be ranked above or below him.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 105, which isn't too bad computationally. So maybe we can precompute all possible sums for each participant.\n\nWait, but each participant has exactly one a and one b. So the initial a and b arrays are for all participants, but the order is arbitrary because the first and second tour results are given without names.\n\nSo, the first step is to find all possible (a_i, b_j) pairs where i and j are distinct? Or wait, no: each participant took both tours, so each a_i is paired with a unique b_j, but the order is unknown. So, the pairing is a permutation of the b array to the a array.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. So, the a array and the b array are permutations of each other, because each participant's first tour score is in a, and second is in b, but we don't know the correspondence between them.\n\nSo, the actual total for each participant is a_i + b_{p(i)}, where p is a permutation of 0..n-1.\n\nWe need to find all possible permutations p where, for some i, a_i + b_p(i) >=x (since Vasya is one of the participants). But since the problem states that it's guaranteed that there exists such i and j, we don't have to worry about the input being impossible.\n\nBut considering all possible permutations is computationally infeasible for n=105, as the number of permutations is way too big.\n\nSo, we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative approach: For each participant, the maximum possible sum they can have is when their a_i is matched with the maximum possible b_j, and the minimum possible sum when a_i is matched with the minimum possible b_j.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the total sum for a participant is a_i + b_p(i), where p is a permutation. So for each a_i, the possible sum is a_i plus any b_j, but each b_j must be used exactly once.\n\nSo, for each a_i, the maximum possible sum for that a_i is a_i + max(b). Similarly, the minimum possible sum is a_i + min(b).\n\nBut since all the b's are used, perhaps the way to model the best case is to assign the largest a_i to the largest b, etc., but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the best possible rank for Vasya would be achieved when his sum is as high as possible, and as many others as possible have lower sums. Conversely, the worst rank is when his sum is as low as possible, and as many others as possible have higher or equal sums.\n\nSo, to compute the best possible rank:\n\nWe need to maximize Vasya's sum. So, find the maximum possible a_i + b_j where a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nWait, but since each a is paired with a unique b, perhaps the maximum possible sum for Vasya is when he takes the maximum a_i plus the maximum b_j, but that's only possible if a_i is not already assigned to another participant.\n\nWait, maybe the way to get the maximum possible sum for Vasya is to choose the pair (a_max, b_max), but that might not be allowed if all other participants have to have their a and b assigned.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum of (a_i + b_j) for all i, j such that (i,j) is a possible assignment, but each a and b can be used only once.\n\nWait, but that's tricky. So, perhaps the maximum possible sum for Vasya is when he gets the maximum possible a and maximum possible b. But then, others can have their own maximums as",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his scores from two tours. The key is to consider all possible valid pairings of participants' scores from the two tours.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each participant has scores from two tours, given in two arrays. The total score for each participant is the sum of their scores from both tours. The goal is to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve, considering all valid permutations of these scores.\n\n2. **Best Possible Rank**: To maximize Vasya's rank, we need to maximize his total score. This is achieved by pairing the highest possible scores from both tours. We compute the maximum possible sum for each participant and determine how many participants can have a higher sum than Vasya.\n\n3. **Worst Possible Rank**: To minimize Vasya's rank, we need to minimize his total score while ensuring it meets or exceeds the minimum required (x). We compute the minimum possible sum for each participant and determine how many participants can have a higher sum than Vasya.\n\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: By sorting the scores from both tours and considering all possible sums, we can efficiently determine the best and worst ranks without explicitly checking all permutations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    # Compute all possible sums for each participant\n    max_b = max(b)\n    min_b = min(b)\n    max_a = max(a)\n    min_a = min(a)\n    \n    # Best case: assign the largest possible a and b to Vasya\n    vasya_max_sum = max_a + max_b\n    \n    # Count how many can have higher sum than vasya_max_sum\n    others_higher = 0\n    for ai in a:\n        for bj in b:\n            if ai == max_a and bj == max_b:\n                continue\n            s = ai + bj\n            if s > vasya_max_sum:\n                others_higher += 1\n            elif s == vasya_max_sum:\n                others_higher += 1\n                # But since they can be arranged after him, it doesn't affect his best rank\n    \n    # For best rank, the number of people with sum > vasya_max_sum is the ones before him\n    # So best rank is others_higher + 1, but wait, no: because in best case, he is first\n    # Wait, no: in best case, others cannot have higher sums.
