Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Vanya is trying to balance the sum of his found cards to zero. The problem gives me the number of found cards and their values, and I have to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find (from an infinite supply) to make the total sum zero. All the new cards must have numbers with absolute value not exceeding x.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. \n\nFirst, let's understand the input. We get n and x, then a list of n integers which are the current card values. The sum of these is S. We need to add some number of cards (let's say k) such that the new total sum is zero. So, the sum of the existing cards plus the sum of the new ones equals zero. That means the sum of the new cards is -S.\n\nBut each new card can be any integer between -x and x, inclusive. So, what's the minimum number of cards needed to reach a sum of -S?\n\nLet's think about the sum required: target = -S.\n\nWe need to express target as the sum of some number of terms, each of which is at most x in absolute value. And we want the minimal k.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the smallest k such that |target| ≤ k * x. Because each term can contribute up to x towards reducing the target (in absolute terms). So the minimal k is the ceiling of |target| divided by x.\n\nWait, no. Wait, because if target is positive, each step can subtract at most x, but since you can choose the signs, it's possible to reach the target in k steps where k is the ceiling of |target|/x.\n\nFor example, if target is 5 and x is 2, then 5/2 is 2.5, so we need 3 steps: 2+2+1=5. Or 2+3? No, wait, each new card can't exceed x in absolute value. So each step can contribute up to x towards the target's absolute value.\n\nWait, no. Let's see: for target T, the minimal number of cards is the minimal k where k is the smallest integer such that k * x >= |T|. Because each card can contribute up to x towards the target's absolute value. So for example, if T is 5 and x is 2, 5/2 is 2.5, so k is 3 because 2*2=4 <5, so we need 3.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the formula is k = ceil(|target| / x).\n\nBut wait, what if target is zero? Then no cards are needed, right? Because the sum is already zero.\n\nSo, the steps I need to do are:\n\n1. Calculate the sum S of the given cards.\n2. Compute target = -S.\n3. If target is zero, output 0.\n4. Else, compute k = ceil(abs(target) / x).\n5. Output k.\n\nLet me test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example:\nInput: 3 2\nCards: -1, 1, 2\nSum S = (-1 +1 +2) = 2.\nTarget is -2.\nabs(target) is 2. x is 2.\n2 / 2 = 1, so k=1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond example:\nInput: 2 3\nCards: -2, -2. Sum is -4. Target is 4.\nabs(target) is 4. x is 3. 4/3 is approx 1.333, so ceil to 2. So two cards: 3 +1 or 2+2, etc. So yes, the sample expects 2.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: target is zero. Then no need for any cards.\n\nCase 2: target is exactly divisible by x. Like target=6, x=3. Then 6/3=2, so k=2.\n\nCase 3: target is negative. But since we take absolute value, it doesn't matter.\n\nAnother example: n=1, x=5, card is 3. Sum S=3. target is -3. abs is 3. x is 5. 3/5 is 0.6, so k=1.\n\nWhat if the sum is zero? Like all cards sum to zero. Then target is zero, so output 0.\n\nAnother case: sum is 5, x=5. target is 5. 5/5=1. So one card of 5 is enough.\n\nAnother case: sum is 7, x=5. 7/5 is 1.4 → ceil to 2. So two cards: 5 and 2, but wait, 2 is within x's limit. So 5+2=7.\n\nWait, but each card can be any integer between -x and x, including both. So for the sum, we can choose any combination, as long as each term is within x.\n\nSo, the approach is correct.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Read n and x.\n- Read the list of n integers.\n- Compute S = sum of the list.\n- target = -S.\n- if target is zero, print 0.\n- else, compute the minimal k as ceil( |target| / x ).\n- print k.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nWait, but wait: What if target is zero but after adding some cards, but initial sum is zero? Then we don't need to add any cards.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\nRead the first line as n and x.\n\nThen read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute S = sum of the list.\n\nCompute target = -S.\n\nIf target is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, compute |target|.\n\nCompute k = (|target| + x -1 ) // x. Because that's equivalent to ceiling division.\n\nWait, yes. For example, 5 / 2 is 2.5, (5+2-1)=6, 6//2=3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in code:\n\nimport math\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\ntarget = -s\nif target == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    absolute_target = abs(target)\n    k = (absolute_target + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but let me test some examples.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput: 3 2\nCards: -1 1 2 → sum is 2. target is -2 → absolute is 2. (2 +2-1)=3, 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nTest case 2:\n\nInput: 2 3\nCards: -2 -2 → sum is -4. target is 4. 4+3-1=6, 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=1, x=5. Card is 3. Sum is 3. Target is -3 → absolute 3. (3+5-1)=7 → 7//5=1. Correct.\n\nn=1, x=5. Card is 0. Sum is 0 → target is 0. Output 0.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nsum is 5, x=5 → 5//5=1.\n\nsum is 6, x=5 → 6/5=1.2 → ceil to 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what if target is zero but the sum is zero? It outputs 0 correctly.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about when x is zero? Wait, no. Looking back at the problem statement, x is given as ≥1. Because in the input constraints, x is 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000. So x can't be zero. So we don't have to worry about division by zero.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his found cards equals zero. Each card can have a value between -x and x (inclusive).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Sum of Found Cards**: First, compute the sum of the values on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Target Sum**: The target sum needed is the negative of the computed sum to make the total sum zero.\n3. **Check for Zero Target**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Compute Minimum Number of Cards**: If the target sum is non-zero, calculate the minimum number of additional cards required. This is done by dividing the absolute value of the target sum by x and rounding up to the nearest integer. This ensures each card contributes as much as possible towards reaching the target sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\ntarget = -s\n\nif target == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    absolute_target = abs(target)\n    k = (absolute_target + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of found cards `n` and the maximum absolute value `x`. The second line reads the values of these `n` cards.\n- **Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the found cards.\n- **Target Calculation**: Determine the target sum needed to balance the total to zero.\n- **Zero Check**: If the target sum is zero, print 0 since no additional cards are needed.\n- **Card Calculation**: For non-zero targets, compute the minimum number of additional cards required using ceiling division to ensure the sum can be reached efficiently.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures the solution is optimal and correct.",
