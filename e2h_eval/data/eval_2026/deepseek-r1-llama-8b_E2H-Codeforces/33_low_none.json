You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to maximize the value of a given integer 'a' by replacing some of its digits with digits from a sequence 's'. Each digit in 's' can be used at most once for replacement. Hmm.\n\nLet me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. So, I'm given two strings: a and s. The string a is the number we have, and s is a sequence of digits. For each digit in s, I can choose any position in a and replace the digit there with that s digit, but each s digit can only be used once. My goal is to perform such replacements that the resulting number is as large as possible.\n\nWait, right. So the key is to replace the smaller digits in a with larger ones from s, starting from the leftmost possible position where a replacement will give the maximum gain.\n\nBut how do I approach this? Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should process each digit of 'a' from left to right. For each position, I want to replace the current digit with the largest possible digit available in 's' that is larger than the current digit. But once I use a digit from 's', I can't use it again.\n\nSo maybe the algorithm goes like this:\n\n1. Convert both 'a' and 's' into lists of characters (digits) for easier manipulation.\n2. Sort the 's' list in descending order. That way, the largest available digits are considered first.\n3. Iterate through each digit in 'a':\n   a. For the current digit, check if there are any digits remaining in 's' that are larger than it.\n   b. If yes, find the largest such digit in 's' and replace the current digit with it. Remove that digit from 's'.\n   c. If no, move to the next digit.\n4. After processing all digits, join the modified 'a' to form the result.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where replacing a less significant digit with a larger one might yield a higher overall number? Like, suppose a is 1234, and s has 9. Replacing the last digit gives 1239, which is better than replacing the third digit to get 1249, which is even better. Wait no, because 1249 is definitely larger than 1239. Oh right, because the change is made earlier, affecting more significant digits.\n\nSo the strategy of replacing the earliest possible digit with the largest possible digit from 's' seems correct.\n\nLet me take the sample input to test this idea.\n\nSample Input:\na = '1024'\ns = ['0', '1', '2'] → Wait, wait, no. Wait, the input is '010' and '987\\n1234567'? Or wait, looking back, the input is given as:\n\nWait, the problem says the second line is the sequence s. Oh, right, the input is two lines: the first line is 'a', the second is 's'.\n\nWait, in the sample input provided, it's written as:\n\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\nWhich probably means that the first line is '1024' followed by '\\n' and then '010' is another part? Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting. No, wait, the problem says that the second line is the sequence of digits s, so in the sample input, the second line is '010' and '987\\n1234567'? Or perhaps the user input is a bit unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nThe first line is '1024' and the second line is '010' and '987\\n1234567' — no, that can't be. Wait, maybe the sample input is:\n\nThe first line is '1024' followed by a newline, and the second line is '010', but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the sample input is a= '1024' and s is '010' concatenated with '9871234567'? No, that would make s longer.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is a being '1024' and s being '0109871234567'? Because the second line in the sample input is written as '987\\n1234567' — maybe that's a typo, or perhaps it's just the way the user presented it.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual sample input is:\n\na is '1024' and s is '0109871234567'?\n\nIn the sample output, the result is '1124' and '987'.\n\nHmm, let's see. How does that happen.\n\nFor a = '1024', s is '0109871234567' — wait, but perhaps the second line is '987' and then '1234567' — so s is '9871234567' ?\n\nWait, the problem says that the second line is a sequence of digits s, which",

Each digit in 's' can be used at most once for replacement. The goal is to perform such replacements that the resulting number is as large as possible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Strings to Lists**: Convert both 'a' and 's' into lists of characters (digits) for easier manipulation.\n2. **Sort Sequence 's'**: Sort the list of digits from 's' in descending order. This allows us to always use the largest available digit when making a replacement.\n3. **Iterate Through Each Digit of 'a'**: For each digit in 'a', check if there are any remaining digits in 's' that are larger than the current digit.\n4. **Replace Digits Optimally**: Replace the current digit with the largest available digit from 's' if it results in a larger number. Remove the used digit from 's' to ensure it is not reused.\n5. **Construct Result**: After processing all digits, join the modified list of 'a' to form the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the value of 'a' by greedily replacing the earliest possible digit with the largest available digit from 's'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na = input().strip()\ns = sorted(input().strip(), reverse=True)\n\na_list = list(a)\ns_ptr = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(a_list)):\n    if s_ptr < len(s):\n        if s[s_ptr] > a_list[i]:\n            a_list[i] = s[s_ptr]\n            s_ptr += 1\n    else:\n        break\n\nprint(''.join(a_list))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Conversion to Lists**: The integer 'a' and the sequence 's' are converted into lists of characters to allow easy modification of individual digits.\n- **Sorting 's'**: Sorting 's' in descending order allows us to efficiently find the largest possible digit to replace each digit of 'a'.\n- **Greedy Replacement**: By iterating through each digit of 'a' from left to right, we replace each digit with the largest possible digit from 's' that is larger than the current digit, ensuring the maximum possible increase in value.\n- **Efficiency**: This method efficiently processes each digit exactly once, making it optimal with a time complexity of O(n log m), where n is the length of 'a' and m is the length of 's'.\n\nThis approach ensures that we achieve the highest possible value for 'a' using the given sequence 's'.",
