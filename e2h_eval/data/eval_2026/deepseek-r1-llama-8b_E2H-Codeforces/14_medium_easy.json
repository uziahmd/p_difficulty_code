He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output all those n's in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n, because there are always more 2s than 5s. So for each multiple of 5, we add one zero, but also for multiples of 25, 125, etc., since they contribute more than one 5.\n\nSo the formula for the number of trailing zeros is sum of n divided by 5, plus n divided by 25, plus n divided by 125, and so on until the division result is zero.\n\nBut how do I find all n's that give exactly m zeros? I think binary search can be useful here. Because the function that calculates the number of trailing zeros is monotonic increasing. As n increases, the number of trailing zeros can only stay the same or increase.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Use binary search to find the smallest n where the number of trailing zeros equals m.\n2. Then, find the largest n where it's still equal to m.\n3. The count k will be the difference between these two n's plus one.\n4. If there's no such n (like when m is larger than any possible count), then output 0.\n\nWait, but wait. How do I know if an m is possible? For example, if m is 100000, maybe there's no n with exactly that many zeros. Or wait, actually, for any m, there exists some n, right? Because as n increases, the number of zeros keeps increasing. So for m=0, n can be 0, but according to the problem statement, n must be positive. Wait, the problem says positive integers. So for m=0, the answer is zero because n! for n>=1 has at least one zero.\n\nWait, no. Let's see: 1! is 1, which has zero zeros. But the problem requires m >=1, so the input m is at least 1. So for m=0, the input isn't given.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Find the lower bound (first occurrence) and upper bound (last occurrence) of m in the trailing zero count.\n\nSo first, implement a function count_trailing_zeros(n) that returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThen, perform a binary search to find the smallest n where count_trailing_zeros(n) == m. Let's call this left.\n\nSimilarly, find the largest n where count_trailing_zeros(n) == m. Call this right.\n\nThe number of such n's is right - left + 1.\n\nIf no such n exists, output 0.\n\nBut wait, how can that happen? Because for any m, there is an n where count equals m. For example, take m=1. We saw that 5! is 120, which has 1 zero. So left would be 5, right would be 9, giving 5 numbers:5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut what about m=6? Let me see:\n\nCompute for various n:\nn=24: 24/5=4, 24/25=0 → total 4 zeros. Not 6.\nn=25: 25/5=5, 25/25=1 → 6 zeros. So left is 25.\n\nIs there an n where the count is 6, beyond 25? Let's try 26: 26/5=5, 26/25=1 → 6 zeros. Same as 25. So right would be 26, 27, etc., until when?\n\nLet's compute count for 29: same as 25, since 29//5=5, 29//25=1 → 6.\n\nWhat about 30: 30//5=6, 30//25=1 → 7 zeros. So right is 29.\n\nSo the range is 25 to 29 inclusive, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nImplement count_trailing_zeros(n):\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nThen, find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) == m.\n\nWe can do this via binary search. The lower bound is 5 (since 5 is the first n with a trailing zero), and the upper bound can be something like m *5, but perhaps a better way is to find an initial high value.\n\nWait, but for very large m, say 1e5, the corresponding n could be up to 5*m, but perhaps even higher? Or is that sufficient?\n\nWait, the count of zeros for n is roughly n/5 + n/25 + ... which is less than n/4. So for a given m, n is at most around 5*m.\n\nSo setting low=0, high=5*m is a good starting point.\n\nBut wait, for m=1, 5*1=5, which is correct. For m=6, 5*6=30, but the right is 29.\n\nSo the binary search for the lower bound:\n\nFind the smallest n where count_zeros(n) >=m.\n\nWait, no, because we need count_zeros(n) == m.\n\nSo perhaps we can find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) ==m, and the maximal n where count_zeros(n) ==m.\n\nAlternatively, find the first occurrence and last occurrence.\n\nSo let's first find the left boundary:\n\nInitialize left=0.\n\nWhile count_zeros(left) < m, set left *=2.\n\nOnce count_zeros(left) >=m, perform binary search between left and 2*left.\n\nWait, but for example, for m=1, left starts at 0, then becomes 0*2=0, still 0, but count is 0.\n\nWait, perhaps better to start with left=0 and keep doubling until count_zeros(left) < m.\n\nWait, no. Because for m=1, when left is 0, count is 0 <1. So we double left to 1, then check count_zeros(1)=0 <1, again. Double to 2, count is 0. Continue until left becomes 5. Then, since count_zeros(5)=1==m, we can proceed to find the minimal n.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nStart with low=0, high=5*m.\n\nCheck if count_zeros(high) >=m.\n\nIf not, it's impossible, but I don't think that can happen.\n\nWait, because for n=5*m, the count is at least m/5 + m/25 + ... which for m=1e5 is 2e4+... So it's definitely larger.\n\nSo, binary search between low=5 and high=5*m.\n\nWait, but for m=0, but the problem says m>=1.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nlow = 5\n\nhigh = 5*m\n\nBut wait, maybe even higher. Because for m=6, 5*6=30, but the actual maximum n is 29.\n\nHmm, but 30 has 7 zeros. So the high can be 5*m, but sometimes, the binary search may go beyond, but that's okay.\n\nSo, for finding the left boundary (the first n where count is m):\n\nWe can do a binary search where for mid, if count(mid) <m, we move low up, else move high down.\n\nWait, no, because we're looking for the first occurrence where count is m.\n\nWait, let's think: for m=1, the first n is 5.\n\nFor m=6, the first n is 25.\n\nSo during binary search, when we have a mid, and count(mid) >=m, we can try to find a smaller n.\n\nElse, we need to go higher.\n\nSo, the binary search for the first occurrence:\n\nleft = 0\n\nright = 5*m\n\nresult = None\n\nwhile left <= right:\n\n    mid = (left + right) // 2\n\n    z = count_zeros(mid)\n\n    if z < m:\n\n        left = mid + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        right = mid -1\n\n        result = mid\n\nAt the end, result is the smallest n where count is m.\n\nSimilarly, find the largest n where count is m.\n\nThis can be done by another binary search.\n\nWait, but once you have the first occurrence, the last occurrence is the largest n where count is m.\n\nSo for that, perhaps the binary search can be done similarly but looking for the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, find the first occurrence, then find the next occurrence after that.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to just run another binary search for the maximum.\n\nSo for the maximum n:\n\nWe can set low = result (the first occurrence) and high = some value, perhaps 5*(m+1).\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to find the maximum n where count is m.\n\nSo for binary search, set low= result and high= result.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach: start with low=0, high=5*m.\n\nWe want to find the largest n where count_zeros(n) ==m.\n\nIn binary search:\n\nlow = 0\n\nhigh = 5*m\n\nmax_n = -1\n\nwhile low <= high:\n\n    mid = (low + high) //2\n\n    z = count_zeros(mid)\n\n    if z == m:\n\n        max_n = mid\n\n        # try to find a larger n\n\n        low = mid +1\n\n    elif z < m:\n\n        low = mid +1\n\n    else:\n\n        high = mid -1\n\nSo, this will find the largest n where count is m.\n\nYes, because if z is equal to m, we set max_n to mid and try higher.\n\nIf z is less than m, we need to go higher.\n\nIf z is greater, we go lower.\n\nSo, with this, we can find both the first and last occurrence.\n\nOnce we have the first and last, the count is last - first +1.\n\nIf no such n exists, output 0.\n\nBut wait, when can that happen?\n\nLike, suppose m is 0. But according to the problem statement, m is at least 1.\n\nSo, for the given constraints, the answer is always at least 1.\n\nWait, no. Suppose m is 10^18, but that's impossible, but the problem constraints say m is up to 1e5, so it's manageable.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute first and last using binary search.\n\nIf first is not found (but in our case, it's always found), output 0.\n\nElse, output the count and the list of n's.\n\nSo, now, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the sample input is a bit tricky. Let me see:\n\nSample Input: '1', '5'\n\nWhich means m=1.\n\nThe first occurrence is 5, last is 9.\n\nSo the output is 5 numbers:5 6 7 8 9.\n\nSample Output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nWait, but in the code, after computing first=5 and last=9, the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo, the code should collect all n from first to last, inclusive.\n\nSo, the output is k followed by the numbers.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif first > last:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    k = last - first +1\n\n    print(k)\n\n    print(' '.join(str(x) for x in range(first, last+1)))\n\nBut wait, in the sample, m=1, first is 5, last is 9.\n\nSo the range is 5,6,7,8,9 → 5 numbers.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nFirst is 25, last is 29. So 5 numbers.\n\nAnother test case: m=5.\n\nWait, wait what is the count for 25? It's 25/5=5, 25/25=1 → 6.\n\nSo for m=5, the count is 5.\n\nWait, let's compute for n=20: 20/5=4, 20/25=0 →4 zeros.\n\nn=21: same as 20.\n\nn=22: same.\n\nn=23: same.\n\nn=24: same.\n\nn=25: 5+1=6.\n\nSo for m=5, the numbers are 20,21,22,23,24.\n\nBecause their counts are 4,4,4,4,4. No, wait, wait.\n\nWait, n=20: 20//5=4, 20//25=0 → 4 zeros.\n\nn=24: same as 20.\n\nn=25: 5 +1=6.\n\nSo for m=5, the numbers where count is 5 are n=20 to 24.\n\nSo first is 20, last is 24. So 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code needs to correctly find that.\n\nSo, the binary search for the first occurrence:\n\nLooking for the smallest n where count(n) is 5.\n\nWhat's count(19):19//5=3, 19//25=0 →3.\n\ncount(20)=4.\n\ncount(21)=4.\n\ncount(22)=4.\n\ncount(23)=4.\n\ncount(24)=4.\n\ncount(25)=6.\n\nSo, the first n where count(n)=5 is 20.\n\nWait, no, wait. Oh, wait, 20's count is 4, 21 is 4, 22 is4, etc. So where is the count equal to 5?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's compute count(20):20 /5=4, 20/25=0 →4.\n\ncount(21): same.\n\ncount(22): same.\n\ncount(23): same.\n\ncount(24): same.\n\ncount(25):6.\n\nSo, for m=5, there is no n where count(n)=5. Because the count jumps from 4 to 6.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So in this case, the code will return no solution, but according to the problem statement, the function count_zeros(n) is non-decreasing. So for m=5, the code would not find any n where count(n) is 5.\n\nBut wait, the sample input in the problem says m=5, but the code returns 0?\n\nNo, wait, in the problem statement's sample input, it's m=1, and the output is 5 numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I was wrong in thinking that for m=5, there's no n with that count.\n\nWait, let's re-calculate:\n\nWhat is the count for n=20:4.\n\nn=24:4.\n\nn=25:6.\n\nSo, between 20 and 24, count is 4, and at 25, it's 6.\n\nSo, for m=5, there's no n that satisfies count(n)=5. So the code would return 0.\n\nBut according to the problem statement's note, the sample shows that 5! has 1 zero, 6! has 1, etc.\n\nWait, but in the code, for m=5, the code would return 0, which is correct.\n\nSo the code correctly handles cases where m is not achievable.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, is there a case where m is not achievable? Like, for any m>=1, there's at least one n where count(n) is m.\n\nWait, for m=5, the count for n=20 is 4, 24 is 4, 25 is 6. So 5 is skipped. So yes, m=5 is not achievable.\n\nSo in that case, the code correctly returns 0.\n\nSo, the code needs to handle such cases.\n\nSo, the code proceeds as follows:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute first and last.\n\nIf first is not found, which can only happen if m=0, but the problem states m>=1, so it's safe.\n\nElse, if first is None, output 0.\n\nElse, compute the numbers.\n\nSo, in the code, after finding first and last, if first exceeds last, output 0.\n\nWait, but how can first exceed last?\n\nBecause first is the smallest n where count is m, and last is the largest. So first must be <= last.\n\nOnly if no such n exists, which can only happen if the count skips m.\n\nSo, the code needs to check whether first and last are found.\n\nBut in our binary search implementation, for m=5:\n\nWhen searching for the first occurrence, the binary search for first would find that there's no n where count is 5.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, in the first binary search for the first occurrence:\n\nWe start with low=0, high=5*m.\n\nFor m=5, high is 25.\n\ncount(25)=6.\n\nSo, during the binary search, the code would look for the smallest n where count is 5.\n\nBut since count(25)=6>5, the code would look for a smaller n.\n\nBut count(24)=4<5.\n\nSo, the binary search would leave the result as None.\n\nWait, no. Let me see.\n\nWait, during the binary search for the first occurrence:\n\nInitially, low=0, high=25.\n\nmid=(0+25)//2=12.\n\ncount(12)=12//5=2, 12//25=0 →2 <5.\n\nSo, low becomes 13.\n\nmid=(13+25)//2=19.\n\ncount(19)=3 <5.\n\nlow becomes 20.\n\nmid=(20+25)//2=22.\n\ncount(22)=4 <5.\n\nlow becomes 23.\n\nmid=24.\n\ncount(24)=4 <5.\n\nlow becomes 25.\n\nmid=25.\n\ncount(25)=6>5.\n\nSo, high becomes 24.\n\nLoop ends.\n\nresult remains None, because the code sets result=mid only when count >=m.\n\nWait, no. Let me look back at the code for the first occurrence.\n\nIn the first binary search:\n\ndef find_first(m):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high =5*m\n\n    res = None\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n\n        if z < m:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n            res = mid\n\n    if res is None:\n\n        return None\n\n    # Now, check if count_zeros(res) ==m\n\n    if count_zeros(res) !=m:\n\n        return None\n\n    # Also, ensure that res is indeed the first occurrence.\n\n    # Maybe the binary search found a higher n where count is m.\n\n    # So, need to find the minimal n where count is m.\n\n    # So, perhaps after the binary search, we need to adjust.\n\n    # Alternatively, after the binary search, we can do a linear search from 0 to res to find the first occurrence.\n\n    # But that could be time-consuming.\n\n    # Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to use the binary search as written, but then verify that the result is correct.\n\n    # Because the binary search may have found a mid where count is m, but perhaps a lower mid exists.\n\n    # So, after the binary search, if res is not None, we need to check if count_zeros(res) is indeed m.\n\n    # Also, to find the minimal n.\n\n    # So, perhaps after the binary search, we can loop from 0 to res to find the first occurrence.\n\n    # Or, perhaps it's better to do a binary search for the first occurrence as follows:\n\n    # Find the first n where count is >=m, then step down to find the minimal n.\n\n    # So, perhaps the code for find_first is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the way the first occurrence is found is not correct.\n\nAlternative approach for find_first:\n\nWe can find the first occurrence by finding the minimal n where count(n) >=m, then check if it's exactly m.\n\nBut no, because there might be no n where count is exactly m.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nAfter performing the binary search for the first occurrence, the res may be a value where count(res) >=m. So, we need to check if any n less than res has count >=m, but that's not necessary.\n\nWait, perhaps the binary search as written may not capture the first occurrence correctly.\n\nLet me think of m=5.\n\nIn this case, the count(n) for n=20 is 4, which is less than 5.\n\nn=25:6>5.\n\nSo, the binary search for the first occurrence would find that res is 25, but count(25) is 6>5.\n\nSo, the code would return res=25, but count is 6≠5.\n\nThus, the function would return None.\n\nSo, in code, the function would detect that and return None, indicating no such n exists.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe need to, after finding res, check if count_zeros(res) is equal to m.\n\nIf not, return None.\n\nSo, the code for find_first:\n\ndef find_first(m):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high =5*m\n\n    res = None\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n\n        if z <m:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n            res = mid\n\n    if res is None:\n\n        return None\n\n    if count_zeros(res) !=m:\n\n        return None\n\n    # Now, check if there is a smaller n.\n\n    # Because during the binary search, res could be higher than the actual first occurrence.\n\n    # So, we need to find the minimal n.\n\n    # So, perform a linear search from 0 to res.\n\n    # Or, perhaps another binary search.\n\n    # Alternative approach: binary search for the first occurrence.\n\n    # Here's an alternative idea.\n\n    # Find the minimal n where count(n) >=m.\n\n    # Then, if count(n) ==m, it's the first occurrence.\n\n    # Else, no solution.\n\n    # So, perhaps the binary search can be modified to find the minimal n where count(n)>=m.\n\n    # Then, check if count(n) is m.\n\n    # Let's implement that.\n\n    low =0\n\n    high =5*m\n\n    first_candidate = None\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n\n        if z <m:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n            first_candidate = mid\n\n    if first_candidate is None:\n\n        return None\n\n    if count_zeros(first_candidate) !=m:\n\n        return None\n\n    # Now, find the minimal n.\n\n    # So, first_candidate could be higher than the minimal n.\n\n    # So, we need to find the smallest n where count(n)==m.\n\n    # So, perhaps a binary search between 0 and first_candidate.\n\n    # Let's try that.\n\n    low =0\n\n    high = first_candidate\n\n    min_n = None\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n\n        if z <m:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n            min_n = mid\n\n    if min_n is None:\n\n        return None\n\n    return min_n\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the binary search for the first occurrence can be done as follows:\n\nWe want to find the minimal n where count(n) >=m, and then check if count(n) is exactly m.\n\nIf not, return None.\n\nOtherwise, return n.\n\nSo, for m=5, the minimal n where count(n)>=5 is 20, but count(20)=4 <5. So, continue.\n\nWait, no. Because 20's count is 4 <5. So the binary search for the minimal n where count >=5 is 25.\n\nCount(25)=6>5. So, the first_candidate is 25. Then, since count(25)!=5, we return None.\n\nSo, the code correctly returns None.\n\nThus, in the code, after the binary search for the first candidate, we have to check if its count is m.\n\nSo, the code for find_first is:\n\ndef find_first(m):\n\n    low =0\n\n    high=5*m\n\n    first_candidate = None\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n\n        if z <m:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n            first_candidate = mid\n\n    if first_candidate is None:\n\n        return None\n\n    if count_zeros(first_candidate) !=m:\n\n        return None\n\n    # Now, find the minimal n where count(n) ==m.\n\n    low =0\n\n    high = first_candidate\n\n    min_n = None\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n\n        if z <m:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n            min_n = mid\n\n    if min_n is None:\n\n        return None\n\n    return min_n\n\nWait, but this seems redundant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to modify the binary search to directly find the first occurrence.\n\nBut perhaps the initial approach is sufficient.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nAfter finding first_candidate, check if its count is m.\n\nIf not, return None.\n\nElse, return the minimal n where count(n) ==m.\n\nSo, the code for find_first is:\n\ndef find_first(m):\n\n    low =0\n\n    high=5*m\n\n    first_candidate = None\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n\n        if z <m:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n            first_candidate = mid\n\n    if first_candidate is None:\n\n        return None\n\n    if count_zeros(first_candidate) !=m:\n\n        return None\n\n    # Now, find the minimal n where count(n) ==m.\n\n    # Binary search between 0 and first_candidate.\n\n    low =0\n\n    high = first_candidate\n\n    min_n = None\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n\n        if z <m:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n            min_n = mid\n\n    return min_n\n\nSimilarly, for the last occurrence, the binary search is as follows:\n\ndef find_last(m):\n\n    low =0\n\n    high=5*m\n\n    max_n = None\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n\n        if z ==m:\n\n            max_n = mid\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        elif z <m:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n    if max_n is None:\n\n        return None\n\n    return max_n\n\nWait, let's test this for m=5.\n\nIn the binary search for the last occurrence:\n\nlow=0, high=25.\n\nmid=12, z=2<5 → low=13.\n\nmid= (13+25)/2=19, z=3<5 → low=20.\n\nmid= (20+25)/2=22, z=4<5 → low=23.\n\nmid=24, z=4<5 → low=25.\n\nmid=25, z=6>5 → high=24.\n\nLoop ends.\n\nmax_n is None.\n\nSo, the function returns None, which is correct.\n\nSo, for m=5, find_first returns None, and thus the code outputs 0.\n\nThus, the code should correctly handle this case.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute first = find_first(m)\n\nCompute last = find_last(m)\n\nIf first is None or last is None:\n\n    print(0)\n\nElse:\n\n    k = last - first +1\n\n    print(k)\n\n    print the numbers from first to last.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input m=1, first is 5, last is 9.\n\nSo, the code correctly outputs 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nFirst is 25, last is 29.\n\nSo, the code outputs 5 numbers.\n\nAnother test case: m=0. But according to the problem statement, m is at least 1, so it's not considered.\n\nAnother test case: m=2.\n\nWhat is the first n where count is 2?\n\nn=10: 10//5=2, 10//25=0 →2.\n\nn=10 is the first.\n\nWhat about the last?\n\nn=14: same.\n\nn=15: 3, so count is 3.\n\nSo, for m=2, the numbers are 10,11,12,13,14.\n\nSo, first is 10, last is 14 →5 numbers.\n\nThus, code should return 5 numbers.\n\nSo, the code should correctly handle these cases.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nImplement helper function count_zeros.\n\nImplement find_first and find_last as described.\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCall find_first and find_last.\n\nIf either is None, output 0.\n\nElse, compute the numbers, output them.\n\nBut wait, for the code, how to read the input?\n\nThe input is a single line, which is a string. For example, in the sample input, it's ['1', '5'], which probably represents m=1 and m=5? Or perhaps it's a typo.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput is the only line contains integer m.\n\nSo, in the sample input, perhaps it's '1' and '5' as separate lines, but in reality, it's a single line.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo, the input is a single integer.\n\nSo, in the sample, perhaps the input is '1' and '5' as two separate test cases, but in reality, it's a single line.\n\nWait, the sample shows the input as ['1', '5'], but that's probably a representation for the user to input two test cases, but in reality, the code should read a single integer.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nm = int(input().strip())\n\nThen proceed.\n\nThus, the code will read m as an integer.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nImplement the functions.\n\nWait, but in Python, functions can't be defined inside the main code unless it's nested, but for the purposes of code submission, it's better to have all in the main.\n\nSo, the code structure:\n\nRead m.\n\nDefine count_zeros.\n\nImplement find_first and find_last.\n\nCompute first and last.\n\nIf first is None or last is None, print 0.\n\nElse, compute the numbers and output.\n\nThus, the code:\n\nm = int(input().strip())\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count =0\n\n    while n>0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\ndef find_first(m):\n\n    low =0\n\n    high=5*m\n\n    first_candidate = None\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n\n        if z < m:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n            first_candidate = mid\n\n    if first_candidate is None:\n\n        return None\n\n    if count_zeros(first_candidate) !=m:\n\n        return None\n\n    # Now find the minimal n\n\n    low =0\n\n    high = first_candidate\n\n    min_n = None\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n\n        if z <m:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n            min_n = mid\n\n    return min_n\n\ndef find_last(m):\n\n    low =0\n\n    high=5*m\n\n    max_n = None\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n\n        if z == m:\n\n            max_n = mid\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        elif z <m:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n    return max_n\n\nfirst = find_first(m)\n\nlast = find_last(m)\n\nif first is None or last is None:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    k = last - first +1\n\n    print(k)\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(first, last+1))))\n\nWait, but let's test this code for m=5.\n\nfind_first returns None, so code prints 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nfind_first returns 25, find_last returns 29.\n\nSo, code outputs 5 numbers.\n\nAnother test case: m=1.\n\nCode outputs 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=2.\n\nfind_first returns 10, find_last returns 14.\n\nCode outputs 5 numbers.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: m=3.\n\nLet's compute:\n\nn=15:15/5=3, 15/25=0 →3.\n\nn=16: same.\n\nn=19:3.\n\nn=20:4.\n\nSo, the first occurrence is 15, last is 19.\n\nThus, 5 numbers:15,16,17,18,19.\n\nSo, code should return that.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nBut what about when m is 0?\n\nAs per the problem statement, m is at least 1, so no need to handle that.\n\nThus, the code should pass all test cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. We then output these integers in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This count is given by summing \\( n \\) divided by 5, \\( n \\) divided by 25, \\( n \\) divided by 125, and so on until the division result is zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for First Occurrence**: Use binary search to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) where the number of trailing zeros equals \\( m \\). This involves searching within a range from 0 to \\( 5 \\times m \\).\n\n3. **Binary Search for Last Occurrence**: Similarly, use binary search to find the largest integer \\( n \\) where the number of trailing zeros equals \\( m \\).\n\n4. **Counting Valid Integers**: Once the first and last occurrences are found, the count of valid integers is the difference between these two values plus one. If no such integers exist, output 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nm = int(input().strip())\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_first(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    first_candidate = None\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n        if z < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n            first_candidate = mid\n    if first_candidate is None:\n        return None\n    if count_zeros(first_candidate) != m:\n        return None\n    # Now find the minimal n\n    low = 0\n    high = first_candidate\n    min_n = None\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n        if z < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n            min_n = mid\n    return min_n\n\ndef find_last(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    max_n = None\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n        if z == m:\n            max_n = mid\n            low = mid + 1\n        elif z < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    return max_n\n\nfirst = find_first(m)\nlast = find_last(m)\n\nif first is None or last is None:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    k = last - first + 1\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(first, last + 1))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) by repeatedly dividing \\( n \\) by 5 and summing the results.\n- **find_first Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( n! \\) has exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros.\n- **find_last Function**: This function uses binary search to find the largest \\( n \\) such that \\( n! \\) has exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros.\n- **Main Logic**: After determining the first and last valid integers, the code checks if they exist and prints the count and the integers accordingly.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, ensuring the solution is both optimal and handles all edge cases.",
