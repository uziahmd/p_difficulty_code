    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I calculate the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. Let's see what the problem says.\n\nThe plate is w rows by h columns. We have k rings to gild. Each ring is a border around the plate, and each subsequent ring is two cells inward. So, the first ring is the outermost edge, the second is two cells away from that, and so on until we've added k rings.\n\nHmm, how do I model each ring? For each i-th ring (starting from 1), the dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, because each ring reduces both width and height by 2 on each side. So for each ring, the perimeter is calculated based on these reduced dimensions.\n\nWait, no, maybe not exactly. Let me think: each ring is a border that is one cell thick. So for a rectangle of size w x h, the perimeter in cells would be 2*(w + h - 2). Because when you outline the rectangle, each row contributes (h) cells, but the corners are counted twice if you just multiply 2*w and 2*h. So subtracting 4 for the four corners.\n\nSo for each ring, the number of cells is 2*(current_w + current_h - 2), where current_w and current_h are the width and height for that particular ring.\n\nBut wait, for the first ring, current_w is w and current_h is h. For the second ring, it's w-2 and h-2, right? Because each ring is two cells inward on all sides. So for each ring i, the width is w - 2*(i-1)*2, same for height. Or wait, maybe it's better to model it as for each step i from 1 to k:\n\nwidth_i = w - 2*(i-1)\nheight_i = h - 2*(i-1)\n\nBecause each ring reduces each dimension by 2 per step. So for i=1, no reduction. For i=2, subtract 2 each, and so on.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Like the sample input where w=7, h=9, k=2.\n\nFirst ring: 7*9. The perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28.\n\nSecond ring: 7-2=5, 9-2=7. Perimeter is 2*(5+7-2)=2*10=20. Total is 28+20=48. But the sample output for 7 9 2 is 40. Oh wait, wait, something's wrong here.\n\nWait wait, the third sample input is '7 9 2' and the output is 40. So according to my calculation, 28 + 12 =40? No, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the ring structure. Maybe each ring is two cells away, but perhaps the formula for the perimeter changes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial ring is at the very edge, then the next ring is two cells inside, which would require that the inner rectangle is (w-4) by (h-4) for the next ring. Because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side, so 2*2=4 subtracted from each dimension.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So for the i-th ring, the current_w is w - 4*(i-1), current_h is h - 4*(i-1).\n\nLet me test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 3: 7 9 2.\n\nFor i=1: current_w=7, current_h=9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28.\n\nFor i=2: current_w=7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5-2)=2*6=12. So total is 28+12=40, which matches the sample output.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the correct way is for each ring i, compute the perimeter as 2*(current_w + current_h - 2), where current_w = w - 4*(i-1), current_h = h -4*(i-1).\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each ring from 1 to k:\n   a. Compute the current width and height.\n   b. Compute the perimeter as 2*(w + h - 2).\n   c. Sum all these perimeters.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Initialize total = 0\n- For i in 1 to k:\n   w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n   h_i = h -4*(i-1)\n  ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is a border around the plate, and each subsequent ring is two cells inward from the previous one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring is a border that is one cell thick. The first ring is the outermost edge, the second ring is two cells away from the edge, and so on. For the i-th ring, the dimensions of the rectangle are reduced by 4*(i-1) on both width and height because each ring reduces each dimension by 2 cells on each side.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the number of gilded cells can be calculated using the perimeter formula for a rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle with width `w` and height `h` is given by `2 * (w + h - 2)`, which accounts for the four corners being counted twice if we simply add the width and height.\n3. **Summing Up**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter and sum them up to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers representing the width, height, and number of rings.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, calculate the current width and height by subtracting 4*(i-1) from the original width and height.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each ring, compute the perimeter using the formula `2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)` and add it to the total count of gilded cells.\n4. **Output the Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells after processing all rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring that each step is straightforward and easy to understand.",
