Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Andrew and Eugene are playing a game. The problem is about substituting digits in a string based on multiple queries and then finding the result modulo 1e9+7.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nThe initial string s consists of digits. Then, there are n queries, each of which is a substitution: replace all occurrences of digit di with the string ti. After processing all queries, we need to compute the numeric value of the resulting string modulo 1e9+7.\n\nHmm, but wait—what's the order of processing the queries? Oh right, the queries are applied in the order given. So each query affects the string, and subsequent queries will act on the modified string.\n\nThe challenge is to process these substitutions efficiently, especially since the string can be up to 105 characters long, and the number of substitutions can be up to 105 as well.\n\nWait, but if each substitution is processed by replacing every occurrence of di in the current string with ti, doing this naively for each query could be computationally expensive if done step by step, especially for large strings or many substitutions.\n\nBut given the constraints, maybe it's manageable. Let's think about how to model this.\n\nAn alternative approach is to represent the substitution rules in a way that can be applied all at once. Because the substitution order matters. For example, if one substitution is di → ti, and another is dj → tj, and di is a substring in ti, then the second substitution must be applied after the first.\n\nSo perhaps, instead of processing each substitution step by step, we can build a substitution map that captures the latest substitution for each digit. Wait, but that might not work because a substitution could affect parts of the string that were generated by previous substitutions.\n\nWait, no. Because each substitution is applied to the entire current string, replacing all instances of di. So the order is important. For example, if we have a substitution like '2→3' followed by '3→5', then all 2s become 3s, and then all 3s (originally from 2s) become 5s. So the final effect is 2→5.\n\nBut if the order was reversed, 3→5 first, then 2→3 would change 2s into 3s, which would then turn into 5s. So the order definitely matters.\n\nThus, to model this correctly, each substitution must be applied in the given order, replacing all instances of the digit in the current string.\n\nSo the straightforward approach is to process each query in sequence, updating the string each time.\n\nBut for a string of length up to 105, and n up to 105, this should be manageable. Each substitution could take O(L) time, where L is the current length of the string. Since 105*105 is 11,025, that's acceptable.\n\nWait, but even better, perhaps we can model the substitution using a dictionary that maps each digit to its replacement string. But since substitutions can be overwritten by later substitutions, the last occurrence of a digit determines its replacement.\n\nWait, that's an interesting point. Suppose we have multiple substitutions for the same digit. Only the last substitution matters because each query replaces all occurrences of di in the current string with ti. So any earlier substitution for di is irrelevant unless it's applied before.\n\nWait no, because each substitution is applied in order. So if we have two substitutions:\n\nFirst: di → ti\n\nSecond: di → ti'\n\nThen, the second substitution will replace all remaining di's in the string (including those that came from the first substitution). So the overall effect is di is replaced by ti'.\n\nBut if a substitution is di → t, and then dj → something that includes di as a substring, that substitution needs to be applied after.\n\nSo the order of substitutions is crucial. So, to model this correctly, each substitution has to be applied in the given order, modifying the string step by step.\n\nSo perhaps the straightforward approach is to process each substitution, and for each character in the current string, if it's di, replace it with ti, else leave it as is.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read the initial string s.\n\n2. For each query, process it in the order given:\n\n   a. The query is a string \"di->ti\".\n\n   b. Split it into di (a single character) and ti (the replacement string).\n\n   c. Replace every occurrence of di in the current string with ti.\n\n3. After processing all queries, compute the numeric value of the resulting string, ignoring leading zeros, except when the string is empty (which equals zero).\n\n4. Return the result modulo 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but what about the modulo part? Since the resulting string can be very long, computing its value directly may cause integer overflows or be computationally expensive. So we need an efficient way to compute",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a series of digit substitution queries on an initial string and then compute the result modulo 1e9+7. Each query replaces all occurrences of a specific digit with a given substring, and these substitutions must be applied in the order they are given.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the initial string and the list of substitution queries.\n2. **Process Queries**: For each query, replace every occurrence of the specified digit in the current string with the given substring.\n3. **Compute Result**: After processing all queries, compute the numeric value of the resulting string, ignoring leading zeros, and return the result modulo 1e9+7.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    query = input().split('->')\n    di = query[0]\n    ti = query[1] if len(query) > 1 else ''\n    s = s.replace(di, ti)\n\n# Handle the case where s is empty\nif not s:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Compute the numeric value modulo MOD\n    result = 0\n    for c in s:\n        result = (result * 10 + int(c)) % MOD\n    print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from standard input.\n2. **Processing Queries**: Each query is split into the digit to replace (`di`) and its corresponding replacement string (`ti`). The current string `s` is updated by replacing all occurrences of `di` with `ti`.\n3. **Computing Result**: After all queries are processed, the resulting string is converted into a numeric value. We iterate over each character in the string, building the result step-by-step while applying modulo 1e9+7 at each step to prevent overflow and ensure efficient computation.\n\nThis approach ensures that each substitution is handled correctly and efficiently, even for the maximum constraints.",
