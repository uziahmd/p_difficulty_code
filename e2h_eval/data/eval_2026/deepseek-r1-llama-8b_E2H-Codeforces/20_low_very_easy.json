For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of ways to choose integers c_s for all binary strings s of lengths from 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. The answer needs to be modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm, let me understand what a beautiful multiset is. A multiset is beautiful if for every string s (from length 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as their prefix doesn't exceed c_s. So for each s, we have a constraint that the count of its prefixes in the multiset is ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased, we're choosing c_s for each s, and then the beautiful multiset is determined based on these c_s's. But the problem isn't about building the multiset; it's about counting the number of possible c assignments where the maximum possible size of such a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nSo, the task is: find the number of assignments of c_s's such that when you construct the maximum possible beautiful multiset based on these c_s's, its size is exactly f.\n\nI think I need to model this as some kind of combinatorial problem where each c_s contributes to the constraints on the counts of certain strings in the multiset.\n\nLet me think about the structure here. For each string s, the number of strings in the multiset that are extensions of s (i.e., s is their prefix) must be ≤ c_s. But since the multiset includes all possible strings, how does this constrain the possible counts?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to model this with inclusion-exclusion or some kind of dynamic programming approach.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this using Möbius transforms or inclusion-exclusion principles because the constraints are hierarchical. Since the strings form a prefix tree (a trie), the constraints for longer strings depend on their prefixes.\n\nWait, each c_s imposes that the number of strings in the multiset that are s followed by any bits is at most c_s. Wait, no—wait, for each s, any string t that has s as a prefix will contribute to the count for s. So for s, the number of t in the multiset where s is a prefix of t is ≤ c_s.\n\nSo, for example, if s is \"0\", then any string starting with \"0\" (like \"00\", \"01\", etc.) in the multiset will count towards c_0.\n\nBut the problem is that the same t may be a prefix of multiple s's. For instance, the string \"0\" is a prefix of \"00\", which is a prefix of \"000\", etc.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps there's a way to model the constraints as a system where each node in the trie (each string s) has a capacity c_s, and the sum of the capacities along the edges from s to its children determines something.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum possible size is the product over all nodes s of (c_s + 1). Because for each node s, the number of strings that start with s (including s itself) is 2^{n - len(s)}. So if for each s, the number of times s appears as a prefix is at most c_s, then the total number of strings in the multiset is the sum for each s of min(c_s, 2^{n - len(s)}). But wait, that might not capture the dependencies correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum size is the sum for each s of the minimum between c_s and the number of strings that have s as a prefix. But that also might not directly translate because the c_s's are interdependent.\n\nWait, no. The maximum size is the sum for each s of the number of times s is a prefix of a string in the multiset. Each such occurrence must be ≤ c_s. So the total size is the sum of all these counts. To maximize the multiset size, for each s, we take as many as possible without exceeding c_s. So the maximum size is the sum for each s of min(c_s, the number of strings that can have s as a prefix).\n\nWait, the number of strings that have s as a prefix is 2^{n - len(s)}, since after s, each position can be 0 or 1. So, the maximum number of times s can appear as a prefix is min(c_s, 2^{n - len(s)}).\n\nSo the total maximum size is the sum over all s of min(c_s, 2^{n - len(s)}).\n\nAh, okay! So the problem reduces to finding the number of assignments of c_s's such that the sum of min(c_s, 2^{n - m}) for all s of length m is exactly f.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the sum is for all",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to assign integers \\( c_s \\) for each binary string \\( s \\) of lengths from 1 to \\( n \\) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly \\( f \\). The result should be computed modulo \\( 998244353 \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: A beautiful multiset is defined such that for every string \\( s \\), the number of strings in the multiset that have \\( s \\) as their prefix does not exceed \\( c_s \\). The goal is to count the number of valid assignments of \\( c_s \\) values that result in the maximum multiset size being exactly \\( f \\).\n\n2. **Constraints and Structure**: Each string \\( s \\) contributes to the constraints based on its length. For each string \\( s \\) of length \\( m \\), the number of strings that can extend \\( s \\) (i.e., have \\( s \\) as a prefix) is \\( 2^{n - m} \\). Thus, the maximum number of times \\( s \\) can appear as a prefix is \\( \\min(c_s, 2^{n - m}) \\).\n\n3. **Summing Contributions**: The total size of the beautiful multiset is the sum of contributions from all strings \\( s \\). Each contribution is \\( \\min(c_s, 2^{n - m}) \\), where \\( m \\) is the length of \\( s \\).\n\n4. **Dynamic Programming and Möbius Transform**: We use dynamic programming to compute the number of valid assignments efficiently. The solution involves transforming the problem using the Fast Möbius Transform to handle the hierarchical nature of the constraints imposed by the prefix relationships.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    k = int(input[1])\n    f = int(input[2])\n    \n    if f == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Compute the maximum possible sum when all c_s are set to infinity.\n    max_sum = 0\n    for m in range(1, n+1):\n        cnt = pow(2, n - m)\n        max_sum += cnt\n        max_sum %= MOD\n    \n    if max_sum < f:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Now, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to assign c_s such that sum(min(c_s, t_m)) = f,\n    # where t_m is 2^{n - m} for each m.\n    # Let's precompute t_m for all m from 1 to n.\n    t = []\n    for m in range(1, n+1):\n        tm = pow(2, n - m)\n        t.append(tm)\n    \n    # We need to find the number of c assignments where sum(min(c_s, t_m)) = f.\n    # Since t_m can be up to 2^14 = 16384, but f can be up to 2e5, which is manageable.\n    \n    # Let's represent the problem in terms of variables x_1, x_2, ..., x_n, where x_m = min(c_m, t_m).\n    # Then, the sum of x_m must be exactly f.\n    # However, since x_m <= c_m, and c_m can be up to k, we have x_m <= min(k, t_m).\n    \n    # So, for each m, x_m can be any integer from 0 to min(t_m, k).\n    # The problem is to count the number of tuples (x_1, ..., x_n) with sum x_m = f, and 0 <= x_m <= min(t_m, k).\n    \n    # To compute this, we can model it as a combinatorial problem where each x_m has a certain number of choices.\n    # Let's compute for each m, the maximum possible x_m: a_m = min(t_m, k).\n    a = [min(tm, k) for tm in t]\n    \n    # The problem is to find the number of solutions to sum x_i = f, where 0 <= x_i <= a_i.\n    # This can be solved using inclusion-exclusion or generating functions, but for small n, we can use DP.\n    \n    # The standard approach is to compute dp[i][s] = number of ways to choose x_1 to x_i with sum s.\n    # Initialize dp[0][0] = 1.\n    # For each i, for each possible s, update dp[i][s + x] += dp[i-1][s], for x from 0 to a_{i}.\n    # Since n is up to 15, and f is up to 2e5, we need to manage the DP state efficiently.\n    \n    # But even better, note that the sum of a_i is sum(min(t_m, k)).
