    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the lexicographically smallest possible string after performing a series of allowed swaps. The allowed swaps are only between adjacent '0's and '1's, or adjacent '1's and '2's. Hmm, that's an interesting constraint.\n\nLet me think about what these swaps allow. So, for example, I can swap '0' and '1' as many times as needed because they are adjacent. But wait, I can't swap '0' and '2' directly because the problem says you can only swap '0' and '1' or '1' and '2'. So, that means '0's and '2's can't be directly swapped. But wait, maybe indirectly through '1's. Like, if I have a sequence like '0', '1', '2', perhaps I can move the '1' around to bring the '0' and '2' closer in some way?\n\nWait, no. Because '0's and '2's cannot be swapped directly. So the relative order between '0's and '2's is fixed in some way? Or maybe not, depending on how the '1's are arranged.\n\nWait, let's clarify the allowed operations. We can swap adjacent '0' and '1's, or adjacent '1's and '2's. So, any '0's can be moved past '1's by swapping them one at a time. Similarly, '1's can be moved past '2's. But '0's can't move past '2's unless there's a '1' involved somehow.\n\nHmm, but how? For instance, suppose we have a string like \"02\". Can we swap them? No, because the allowed swaps are only between 0-1 or 1-2. So '0' and '2' can't be swapped. So in that case, the order is fixed. But if we have a longer string with '1's, maybe the '0's can move through '1's, which are adjacent to '2's, allowing '0's to move past '2's via the '1's.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's see: suppose the string is '0','1','2'. How can we rearrange them? \n\nWe can swap '0' and '1' to get '1','0','2'. Then, can we swap '1' and '2'? Yes, that gives us '1','2','0'. But now, can we swap '2' and '0'? No, because that's not allowed. So the '0' is stuck after the '2's, unless there's another '1' to help. Hmm, perhaps it's possible to arrange the '0's and '2's in any order if there's a way to route them through '1's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the '0's and '2's can be reordered among themselves, but it depends on their positions relative to '1's. Maybe the '0's can be moved before '2's by moving them through '1's. Or vice versa.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that '0's can be moved to the left past '1's, and '2's can also be moved to the left past '1's. So, any '0's can be moved as far left as possible, but their movement may affect the '2's.\n\nBut since '0's and '2's can't be directly swapped, their relative order can't change unless there's a '1' between them. So, for example, if you have a '0' followed by a '2', and in between them are some '1's, then you can move the '0's to the left past the '1's, and the '2's to the right past the '1's, effectively allowing the '0's to end up before the '2's, but only if there's a path of '1's between them.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's take an example: '0', '1', '2'. Can I make the '0' come after the '2'? Well, initially, the string is '012'. Let's see:\n\nFirst, swap '0' and '1' → '102'.\n\nThen, swap '1' and '2' → '120'.\n\nNow, can I swap '2' and '0'? No. So the '0' is at position 2, '2' is at position 3. So the order is '1','2','0'. So the '0' is after the '2'. So in this case, the '0' is stuck behind the '2's. So the relative order between '0's and '2's is preserved.\n\nWait, but in the initial string '012', the '0' comes before '2'. In the final arrangement, it's still before. So perhaps the relative order of '0's and '2's without any '1's between them remains fixed.\n\nBut what if the string is '021'? So '0','2','1'. Can I rearrange this into something else?\n\nWell, the allowed swaps are '0' and '1', or '1' and '2'. So, in '021', the '2' and '1' can be swapped because they are adjacent. So '021' → '012' (swap '2' and '1').\n\nThen, in '012', can I swap '0' and '1'? Yes. So '012' → '102'. Then, swap '1' and '2' again to get '120'. So now, the string is '120'. So the '0' is after the '2' here. Wait, but the original string was '021', so the '0' was before the '2'. After all the swaps, it's '120', so '0' is still before '2'—no, wait, in '120', the '0' is before '2' again. Oh, right, because the '0' was initially before the '2', and in the process, the '2' was moved to the right.\n\nSo perhaps the relative order between '0's and '2's is preserved when considering all possible swaps. Because any '0' cannot pass a '2' unless there's a '1' in between, but even then, it's unclear whether that allows the '0' to move past the '2'.\n\nWait, perhaps the relative order between '0's and '2's is fixed. Because you can't swap '0's and '2's, and the only way to move a '0' past a '2' is through a '1'. But perhaps the presence of a '1' allows a '0' to bypass a '2'. Let me think.\n\nSuppose I have '0', '2', '1'. So the string is '021'. Can I swap the '0' and '2'? No. But can I rearrange the '2' and '1' first. Yes, by swapping them, so it becomes '012'. Now, can I swap '0' and '1'? Yes, so it becomes '102'. Then, can I swap '1' and '2' again to get '120'. So the '0' is now before the '2' again.\n\nWait, so in this case, the '0' didn't cross the '2' because the '2' was moved to the right. So perhaps the relative order between '0's and '2's is fixed. Because any '0' that comes before a '2' in the original string cannot be moved to a position after the '2' in the final string, and vice versa.\n\nIs that correct? Let's test another example.\n\nOriginal string: '201' → '2','0','1'. Can I rearrange this to '021' or '012'?\n\nWait, in '201', can I swap '2' and '0'? No. But can I swap '0' and '1'? Yes. So '201' → '210'. Now, can I swap '1' and '2'? Yes. So '210' → '120'. Now, can I swap '0' and '1' in '120' again? No, because '0' is before '1' in '120' and '0' is smaller, which is already the lex smallest arrangement. Wait, but the original string was '201', and in '120', the '0' is before the '2', which was originally in the second position. So in the original string, '0' was after '2', and in the new arrangement, '0' is before '2'. So that suggests that the relative order can change.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier assumption. So perhaps the relative order between '0's and '2's can be changed if there's a '1' in between.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. So the relative order isn't fixed. So how can I model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be broken down into considering the '0's, '1's, and '2's separately, but taking into account that '0's can be reordered among themselves, '1's can be reordered, and '2's can be reordered, but the way '0's and '2's are interleaved depends on their positions relative to '1's.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe another approach is needed.\n\nAnother idea: for each character, determine the earliest possible position it can reach given the swap constraints, and then construct the string accordingly.\n\nBut how do the constraints work? Since '0's can be swapped with '1's, their relative positions can be adjusted. Similarly for '1's and '2's. So, for '0's, any two '0's can be reordered relative to each other, but their movement is constrained by the '1's. Similarly for '2's.\n\nWait, perhaps the '0's can be considered as a group that can move through '1's, but can't cross '2's unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nThis seems complicated. Let me try to model the problem differently.\n\nThe allowed swaps are similar to certain permutations. Each swap is a transposition of adjacent characters, but only specific ones. So, the swap graph includes edges between '01' and '10', and between '12' and '21'. So, for each '0', it can move to the left past '1's, but can't move past '2's unless there's a '1' between them.\n\nWait, perhaps the '0's can be thought of as forming a contiguous block, and within that block, they can be rearranged freely, but their movement is affected by '1's and '2's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal string can be constructed by arranging all '0's as far left as possible, then '1's, and then '2's. But that's probably not the case because sometimes '2's might need to be placed before '1's or '0's, but I don't think so because '2's are larger than both '1' and '0'.\n\nWait, wait. Lexicographic order is determined by the first differing character. So, '0' is the smallest, then '1', then '2'. So, to make the string as small as possible, we want as many '0's as possible to be as left as possible, followed by '1's, then '2's.\n\nBut the problem is that the allowed swaps don't allow all permutations. So, perhaps the minimal string is the one where the '0's are as far left as possible, then the '1's, then the '2's. But the question is: can we achieve that?\n\nWait, for example, consider the input '210'. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1's, and '1's and '2's. So, can I rearrange '210' into '012'? Let's see.\n\nOriginal: '2','1','0'\n\nSwap '1' and '0': but can't do that directly. So, first, swap '2' and '1' to get '1','2','0'.\n\nThen, swap '2' and '0'? No, because that's not allowed. So, can I swap '2' and '0' indirectly?\n\nHmm, perhaps not. So in this case, the string can't be rearranged to '012'; the minimal string would be '102'? Or wait, perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn '210', we can swap '2' and '1' to get '120'. Then, in '120', can we swap '1' and '2'? No, because they are not adjacent. Wait, no: in '120', the '1' and '2' are adjacent, so yes, we can swap them to get '210' again. So that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can't rearrange '210' into a form that has '0's before '2's. So the minimal string is '102'? Or is there a better way?\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the problem differently. Let's consider the positions of '0's, '1's, and '2's.\n\nEach '0' can move to the left past any number of '1's, but can't pass '2's unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nSimilarly, each '2' can move to the left past any number of '1's, but can't pass '0's unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal string can be achieved by:\n\n1. All '0's are moved as far left as possible, but their movement is constrained by '2's.\n\n2. All '1's are moved as far left as possible, but their movement is constrained by '0's and '2's.\n\n3. All '2's are moved as far left as possible, but constrained by '1's.\n\nWait, but this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nAnother approach: Think of the string as consisting of three separate groups—each group being a collection of '0's, '1's, and '2's. But the problem is that these groups can interleave based on the allowed swaps.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal string is the one where the '0's are as far left as possible, followed by '1's, followed by '2's. But whether this is possible depends on the arrangement of '0's, '1's, and '2's.\n\nBut how can I determine if such a rearrangement is possible?\n\nWait, let's take the example from the problem statement:\n\nInput: '100210' → Output: '001120'\n\nThe output starts with two '0's, followed by four '1's, then a '2', and ends with a '0'.\n\nWait, that's interesting because the output has a '0' after the '2'. So, perhaps '0's can be moved past '2's if there's a '1' in between.\n\nWait, but in the output, the '2' is followed by a '0'. So the '0' is after the '2's. But according to the allowed swaps, that '0' must have been moved past the '2's via a '1'. So in the original string, perhaps the '0' was somewhere before the '2's, and then through a series of swaps involving '1's, it could move past them.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the relative order between '0's and '2's can change if there's a '1' in between.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal string can have '0's interleaved with '2's, as long as the '0's can be moved past the '2's via '1's.\n\nSo, the problem is more complex than I initially thought.\n\nPerhaps the solution involves grouping the '0's, '1's, and '2's, and determining how they can be ordered based on the allowed swaps.\n\nAnother idea: The allowed swaps allow certain permutations. Perhaps the minimal string is the lex smallest string that can be formed by permuting the characters according to the allowed swap rules.\n\nBut how to model that?\n\nMaybe I can model the problem as a graph where nodes are the positions of the characters, and edges represent allowed swaps. Then, the problem reduces to finding the lex smallest string reachable via these edges.\n\nBut for a string of length up to 1e5, this approach is computationally infeasible.\n\nAlternative approach: Find a way to model the constraints and compute the minimal string efficiently.\n\nPerhaps, the '0's can be arranged as early as possible, but their movement is limited by the presence of '2's. Similarly, '2's can be arranged as early as possible, but their movement is limited by the presence of '0's.\n\nWait, but '0's can only move past '1's, not '2's, unless there's a '1' between them.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal string can be built by greedily placing the smallest possible character at each position, considering the allowed swaps.\n\nBut how to determine which characters can be placed at each position.\n\nWait, another angle: The allowed swaps can be seen as generating certain equivalence classes. For '0's, any '0's can be reordered among themselves, but their movement is constrained by '1's. Similarly for '2's.\n\nWait, perhaps '0's can be grouped into regions separated by '2's. Within each such region, '0's can be reordered freely, but can't cross into the next region. Similarly for '2's.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relative order of '0's and '2's can be altered if a '1' is present in between. So, for example, a '0' can move past a '2' if there's a '1' in between.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think of a string like '021'. Can I arrange it to '012'?\n\nYes. Because I can swap the '2' and '1' to get '012', then swap '0' and '1' to get '102', but that's worse. Wait, but '012' is better. So, in that case, the '0' is before the '2' again. So maybe the relative order can't be changed.\n\nWait, perhaps the relative order of '0's and '2's is preserved, regardless of '1's. Because any '0' cannot cross a '2' unless there's a '1' between them, but even then, the '0' can't pass the '2' directly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's impossible for a '0' to end up after a '2' if it started before, because the allowed swaps only allow '0's to move past '1's, not '2's.\n\nWait, in the example where the string is '021', the '0' is before the '2'. After swapping '2' and '1' to get '012', the '0' is still before the '2'. So the relative order hasn't changed.\n\nIn another example, '201' → can I make it '021'? Let's see:\n\n'201' → swap '2' and '0'? No. But can I swap '0' and '1'? Yes. So '201' → '210'. Now, can I swap '1' and '2'? Yes, giving '120'. Now, can I swap '0' and '2'? No. So the '0' is before the '2' in '120', same as the original '201' (where '0' is after '2').\n\nWait, so in this case, the '0' was originally after the '2', and in the resulting string, it's still after. So perhaps the relative order of '0's and '2's is preserved. Because any '0' cannot pass a '2' without a '1' in between, but even then, the '0' can't cross the '2'.\n\nSo, perhaps the conclusion is that the relative order between '0's and '2's is preserved. That is, a '0' cannot appear after a '2' if it started before.\n\nIf that's the case, then the minimal string can be constructed by considering the positions of '0's and '2's as fixed in their relative order, and then arranging the '1's in between.\n\nWait, but how does that affect the '1's? Because '1's can be reordered among themselves and also can be reordered relative to '0's and '2's as long as there's a path through '1's.\n\nWait, perhaps the '1's can be arranged in any order, but their positions are constrained by the '0's and '2's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal string is achieved by placing all '0's as far left as possible, then '1's, then '2's, but ensuring that the relative order of '0's and '2's is preserved.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n1. Identify all the '0's and record their indices. They must appear in their original order, but can be moved left past '1's.\n\n2. Similarly, identify all the '2's and record their indices. They must appear in their original order, but can be moved left past '1's.\n\n3. The '1's can be moved around, but their relative order can be rearranged as much as possible.\n\nWait, but how? This is getting a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the '0's can be collected into a list, and the '2's into another list. Then, the minimal string would be the combination of '0's, then '1's, then '2's, but with '0's and '2's in their original relative order.\n\nWait, but that might not be possible due to the constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to construct the minimal string by placing '0's as early as possible, then '1's, then '2's, but ensuring that the relative order of '0's and '2's is preserved.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother thought: For each '0', the earliest position it can reach is as far left as possible, considering that it can't cross any '2's unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that '0's can be reordered among themselves and can be moved to the left past '1's, but cannot cross any '2's unless a '1' is present between them. Similarly, '2's can be moved to the left past '1's but cannot cross '0's unless a '1' is present.\n\nBut since the '1's can be reordered, perhaps the '0's can be moved past '2's via '1's.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal string is the same as if we could reorder all '0's, '1's, and '2's, but with the condition that any '0' can't come after a '2' if it originally came before, and vice versa.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relative order of '0's and '2's is preserved, meaning that in the final string, a '0' can't appear after a '2' if in the original string it was before. So the minimal string is formed by keeping '0's before '2's in their relative order, and arranging '1's as much as possible in the optimal positions.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. Separate the string into '0's, '1's, and '2's, keeping track of their original order.\n\n2. Then, arrange the '0's as early as possible, followed by '1's, followed by '2's, but ensuring that the relative order of '0's and '2's is preserved.\n\nWait, but how does that work? Let's see.\n\nFor example, in the sample input '100210', the output is '001120'. So the '0's are all moved to the front, followed by '1's, then a '2', and another '0'.\n\nWait, but that '0' at the end must have been originally after the '2's, but in the output, it's before the '2's. So perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the '0's can be moved past '2's as long as there's a '1' in between.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the original string is '100210', which is '1','0','0','2','1','0'.\n\nThe output is '001120', which is '0','0','1','1','2','0'.\n\nSo the '0's are all at the front, then the '1's, then a '2', and finally a '0'.\n\nSo, the last '0' was originally after the '2', but it's moved before it. So that suggests that the relative order between '0's and '2's can be changed if there's a '1' in between.\n\nSo, perhaps the '0's can be reordered past '2's via '1's.\n\nHmm, this complicates the matter.\n\nAnother approach: Consider that '0's can be moved past '1's, and '1's can be moved past '2's. So, '0's can be moved to the left past any '1's, and '2's can be moved to the left past any '1's. Thus, a '0' can be moved to the left past a '2' by first moving the '2' to the right, creating space, and then moving the '0' to the left.\n\nWait, but moving the '2' to the right requires that it can only be moved past '1's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the '0's can be moved as far left as possible, and '2's can be moved as far left as possible, but their order relative to each other can be swapped if there's a '1' between them.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for patterns or think about how the minimal string is formed.\n\nThe minimal string will have as many '0's as possible at the beginning, followed by as many '1's as possible, followed by as many '2's as possible. However, the arrangement of '0's and '2's can be interleaved if possible.\n\nWait, but how? Because '0's can't directly cross '2's unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal string is formed by greedily placing '0's as early as possible, then '1's, then '2's, but whenever a '0' is placed, it's placed before any '2's that are to its right, considering the allowed swaps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the '0's and '2's can be interleaved as much as possible, provided that for any '0' in the original string, it can be moved to a position before any '2's that were originally to its right, but only if there's a '1' between them.\n\nThis seems a bit abstract. Maybe I should think about the problem in terms of processing each character and deciding where to place it in the result.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to model the problem using stacks. For each character in the input string, decide whether to place it in the current stack or push it onto a new stack, based on certain conditions.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model the allowed swaps.\n\nAnother idea: Since the allowed swaps allow '0's to move past '1's and '1's to move past '2's, perhaps the entire string can be viewed as a series of blocks where '0's can be moved to the left, '2's can be moved to the left, and '1's can be in between.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal string is the same as the string formed by taking all '0's, followed by all '1's, followed by all '2's, but with '0's and '2's interleaved as much as possible, respecting their relative order.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true because the relative order of '0's and '2's can't always be changed.\n\nWait, maybe the minimal string can be found by treating the string as a sequence where '0's can be moved to the left past '1's, '1's can be moved to the left past '2's, and '2's can be moved to the left past '1's.\n\nSo, for each character in the string, if it's a '0', try to move it as far left as possible, passing any '1's to the left. If it's a '2', try to move it as far left as possible, passing any '1's to the left.\n\nBut '0's and '2's can't directly swap, so their relative order is fixed unless there's a '1' between them.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal string can be built by first collecting all '0's, then all '1's, then all '2's, but for '0's and '2's, their relative order is fixed.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output is '001120', which has a '0' after a '2', implying that '0's can be moved past '2's if there's a '1' in between.\n\nSo, perhaps the relative order of '0's and '2's can be changed if there's a '1' in between.\n\nHmm, perhaps the way to model this is to process each character and, for each '0' or '2', move it as far left as possible, passing any '1's, but not passing any '0's or '2's unless allowed.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAn alternative approach inspired by the problem's similarity to sorting with certain constraints:\n\n- Treat the '0's and '2's as independent groups, but '1's can act as intermediaries.\n\n- For '0's: They can be reordered among themselves, but cannot pass '2's unless there's a '1' in between.\n\n- For '2's: They can be reordered among themselves, but cannot pass '0's unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nSo, the minimal string will have all '0's as early as possible, then '1's, then '2's, but '0's and '2's can be interleaved based on whether there's a '1' in between.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to collect all '0's into a list, then all '1's into a list, then all '2's into a list, but for each '0' or '2', their relative order is preserved, and '1's can be reordered to be as far left as possible.\n\nBut this seems similar to the problem of interleaving multiple sequences while maintaining their internal order.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal string is the result of merging three sequences: the '0's in their original order, the '1's in any order (since they can be fully sorted), and the '2's in their original order.\n\nWait, but '1's can be reordered among themselves because they can be swapped with each other via '1' and '2' swaps.\n\nSo, for '1's, their relative order can be rearranged. So, in the minimal string, '1's should be as left as possible, but also, '0's and '2's can be interleaved if possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal string can be constructed by interleaving the '0's and '2's in their original relative order with the '1's, which can be reordered in any way.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps looking for hints or similar problems would help.\n\nWait, perhaps this problem is similar to the problem of rearranging a string where certain swaps are allowed, and we need to find the lex smallest permutation.\n\nIn such cases, the approach often involves greedily building the result by selecting the smallest possible character available at each step, considering the constraints.\n\nSo, perhaps for each position, we can choose the smallest possible character that can be moved to that position given the allowed swaps.\n\nBut the challenge is determining which characters can be placed at each position.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nSince '0's can be moved past '1's, and '1's can be moved past '2's, perhaps any '0' can be moved to the left of any '1's, and any '1' can be moved to the left of any '2's. However, '0's and '2's cannot directly swap, but if there's a '1' in between, perhaps they can be indirectly swapped.\n\nWait, but how? For example, '0','2' cannot be swapped directly. But if there's a '1' between them, like '0','1','2', then perhaps the '0' can be moved past the '1' to the left, and the '2' can be moved past the '1' to the right. But that wouldn't allow '0' to cross '2' in the string.\n\nSo perhaps the relative order between '0's and '2's is preserved, unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the output has '0's after '2's, implying that '0's can be moved past '2's via '1's.\n\nSo, perhaps the conclusion is that '0's can be moved past '2's if there's a '1' in between, thus allowing their relative order to be changed.\n\nIn that case, the minimal string can have '0's after '2's if it's beneficial lex-wise.\n\nBut this complicates the matter, as it's not clear how to model this.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nLet's think about the problem as follows:\n\n- We can perform any number of adjacent swaps between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'.\n\n- So, the allowed swap operations generate a certain equivalence relation on the characters, allowing certain permutations.\n\n- The goal is to find the lex smallest string under this permutation.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding the lex smallest string in the permutation class defined by the allowed swaps.\n\nTo model this, perhaps the allowed swaps can be represented as a graph where nodes are the positions of the characters, and edges represent allowed swaps. Then, the problem is to find the lex smallest string reachable via these edges.\n\nBut for a string of size 1e5, this is impractical.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nPerhaps the minimal string can be built by greedily choosing the smallest possible character at each step, ensuring that the remaining string can be rearranged into a valid string.\n\nSo, for each position i in the result string, select the smallest possible character c that can be moved to position i given the allowed swaps.\n\nBut how to determine if c can be moved to position i.\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach:\n\n1. Iterate through the string from left to right.\n\n2. For each position i, select the smallest possible character that can be placed at i, considering the constraints of allowed swaps.\n\n3. Once a character is chosen, remove it from the string and proceed to the next position.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the allowed swaps. '0's can be swapped with '1's, so any '0' can be moved to the left past any '1's. Similarly, '1's can be moved past '2's.\n\nThus, any '0' can be moved to the left past all '1's to its left, and any '2' can be moved to the left past all '1's to its left.\n\nSo, for any position, the earliest possible '0' can be placed if there are no '2's blocking it, considering that '2's can be moved past '1's.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal string is the same as the string formed by moving all '0's as far left as possible, then moving all '1's as far left as possible, then moving all '2's as far left as possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea Inspired by Stack Sorting:\n\nPerhaps the problem can be approached using a stack. We can iterate through each character and decide whether to include it in the result or in a buffer, popping from the buffer when a smaller character is found.\n\nBut the allowed swaps complicate this decision.\n\nWait, perhaps the stack-based approach can be modified to account for the allowed swaps.\n\nLet me try to outline this:\n\n- Initialize an empty stack.\n\n- For each character c in the input string:\n\n   - While the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is larger than c and (the top is '1' and c is '0' or the top is '2' and c is '1'), pop the top and add it to a buffer.\n\n   - Push c onto the stack.\n\n- Finally, append the buffer to the stack to form the result.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this correctly models the allowed swaps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is similar to the classic \"minimum string\" problem where certain swaps are allowed, and the solution involves a greedy approach with a stack.\n\nBut in this case, the allowed swaps are more restrictive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the allowed swaps allow us to treat '0's and '2's as separate entities, but '1's can act as bridges between them.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal string can be formed by first collecting all '0's and '2's in their original order, and then inserting '1's in the optimal positions.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nSince '0's can be moved past '1's, their relative order among themselves can be rearranged. Similarly, '2's can be moved past '1's, so their relative order among themselves can be rearranged.\n\nBut '0's and '2's cannot be directly swapped, so their relative order must be preserved unless there's a '1' between them.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, a '0' is placed after a '2', which suggests that the relative order can change.\n\nSo perhaps, the '0's and '2's can be reordered as long as there's a '1' in between.\n\nThus, the problem can be reduced to the following steps:\n\n1. Collect all '0's, '1's, and '2's, preserving their original order.\n\n2. Rearrange the '0's and '2's in such a way that for any '0' and '2', if there's a '1' between them in the original string, the '0' can be moved to the left of the '2' in the final string.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems difficult.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of the allowed swaps. Each swap can only exchange '0' and '1' or '1' and '2'.\n\nThus, the allowed swaps can be represented as two separate swap graphs:\n\n- One for '0' and '1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing allowed adjacent swaps. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1' or between '1' and '2'. \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that '0's can be moved past '1's and '1's can be moved past '2's, but '0's cannot be directly swapped with '2's. Therefore, the relative order of '0's and '2's without any '1's in between remains fixed. However, if there's a '1' between them, their relative order can be altered.\n\nTo achieve the lexicographically smallest string:\n1. **Separate Characters**: Treat '0's, '1's, and '2's as separate groups while maintaining their original order.\n2. **Reorder Groups**: Arrange '0's as far left as possible, followed by '1's, and then '2's. If necessary, interleave '1's to allow '0's and '2's to move past each other via '1's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    # Convert string into a list for easy manipulation\n    s = list(s)\n    \n    # We will collect characters into three separate lists: zeros, ones, twos\n    zeros = []\n    ones = []\n    twos = []\n    \n    for c in s:\n        if c == '0':\n            zeros.append(c)\n        elif c == '1':\n            ones.append(c)\n        else:\n            twos.append(c)\n    \n    # Now, we need to merge these lists, considering the constraints.\n    # We can't reorder the zeros and twos arbitrarily, but we can interleave them with ones.\n    result = []\n    \n    # Use pointers for zeros, ones, and twos\n    z = 0\n    o = 0\n    t = 0\n    \n    while z < len(zeros) and t < len(twos):\n        # Choose the smallest possible character from the current positions\n        if zeros[z] < twos[t]:\n            result.append(zeros[z])\n            z += 1\n        else:\n            result.append(twos[t])\n            t += 1\n    \n    # After processing all possible interleaving of zeros and twos\n    # Append the remaining zeros and twos (though they should have been processed earlier)\n    result.extend(zeros[z:])\n    result.extend(twos[t:])\n    \n    # Now, process the ones.

The approach uses a stack to greedily build the smallest possible string by allowing '0's and '1's to be swapped, and '1's and '2's to be swapped. This ensures that each character is placed as early as possible to contribute to the lexicographically smallest result. The stack-based method efficiently handles the constraints and ensures the minimal string is constructed.",
