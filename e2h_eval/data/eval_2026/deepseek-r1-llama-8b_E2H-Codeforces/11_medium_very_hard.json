A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires some resources: drink, lime slices, and salt. I need to calculate how many toasts each friend can make given the available resources.\n\nLet's break down the input variables:\n\nn: number of friends\nk: number of bottles bought\nl: milliliters per bottle\nc: number of limes\nd: slices per lime\np: grams of salt\nnl: milliliters needed per friend per toast\nnp: grams of salt needed per friend per toast\n\nEach toast requires:\n- Each friend needs nl ml of drink.\n- One slice of lime per friend.\n- np grams of salt per friend.\n\nSo for one toast, all n friends are making a toast. That means each toast consumes:\n- n * nl ml of drink (since each of the n friends takes nl)\n- n slices of lime (each takes one)\n- n * np grams of salt\n\nWait, no. Wait, each friend needs a slice for each toast. So for one toast, each friend uses one slice. So total slices needed per toast is n slices.\n\nSo let's calculate the total resources.\n\nFirst, total drink available is k * l milliliters.\n\nEach toast requires n * nl milliliters. So the maximum number of toasts possible based on drink is (total_drink) // (n * nl).\n\nWait, yes. Because each toast needs n * nl ml, so total toasts t_drink = (k*l) / (n * nl). But since we can't have fractions, we take the integer division.\n\nNext, the lime slices. Total slices available is c * d. Each toast needs n slices. So t_lime = (c*d) // n.\n\nSalt: total salt is p grams. Each toast needs n * np grams. So t_salt = p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum of these three values: min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt).\n\nBut wait, no. Because the total toasts is the same across all three resources. Because each toast uses all three resources. So the actual maximum number of toasts possible is the minimum of the three individual maxima.\n\nSo for example, if the drink allows 6 toasts, limes allow 80, and salt allows 100, then the maximum is 6. But wait, in the note, the sample input is 3 friends, which is n=3. The drink gives 20ml, so 20/(3*3)=2.333... but they take the floor? Or do they not? Wait, the note says that in the first sample, 20/3 is 6.666, but the drink is 20ml, each toast requires 3*3=9ml? No, wait the first sample input is '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'.\n\nWait, let me check the sample:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5 → total drink is 4*5=20ml.\n\nEach toast requires n * nl = 3 * 3 =9ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222..., so 2 toasts.\n\nLimes: c=10, d=8 → 80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices. 80 /3 is 26.666 → 26? But the note says it's 80 toasts. Wait, wait, no.\n\nWait, in the note, they say that the drink is enough for 6 toasts, limes 80, salt 100. But in the sample input, the output is 2. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the wrong understanding. Let's re-examine the problem statement.\n\nEach friend needs nl milliliters per toast, and np grams per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends takes nl ml and np grams. So for one toast, total drink used is n * nl, and salt is n * np.\n\nSo for the first sample:\n\nn=3, so each toast uses 3*3=9ml, 3*1=3g of salt.\n\nTotal drink is 20ml. So 20 /9 is 2 toasts (since 2*9=18, 3*9=27>20).\n\nSalt is 100g. Each toast uses 3*1=3g. 100 /3 is 33.333, so 33 toasts. Wait, but that would be more than the drink.\n\nWait, but in the note, the sample says the answer is min(6,80,100)/3=2. Oh, wait, maybe I messed up.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-calculate:\n\nIn the note, the total drink is 4*5=20ml. Each toast requires 3 * 3=9ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222, which is 2 toasts.\n\nThe limes: 10 limes cut into 8 slices each → 80 slices. Each toast requires 3 slices → 80 /3 is 26.666 → 26 toasts.\n\nSalt: 100g. Each toast needs 3 *1=3g → 100 /3=33.333 →33 toasts.\n\nSo the min is 2. So the answer is 2 toasts per friend.\n\nSo the maximum number of toasts is the minimum between the drink, lime, and salt constraints.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nCompute the maximum possible toasts based on drink, lime, and salt.\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three numbers.\n\nBut wait, in the note, they compute t_drink as 20 /3=6. How does that happen?\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me read the problem again.\n\nAh! Oh right, each friend needs nl milliliters per toast. So for each toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So per toast, the total drink consumed is n * nl.\n\nSo the maximum number of toasts from drink is (k * l) / (n * nl), using integer division.\n\nSimilarly, per toast, each friend needs a slice, so per toast, n slices are needed. So maximum toasts from limes is (c * d) / n.\n\nFor salt: each friend uses np grams, so per toast, n * np grams. So maximum toasts is p / (n * np), integer division.\n\nSo for each resource, the maximum toasts is:\n\nt_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nt_lime = (c * d) // n\nt_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nThen, the maximum number of toasts possible is the minimum of t_drink, t_lime, t_salt.\n\nOnce we have that, the answer is that number because each toast is made by all friends once. So each friend can make that many toasts.\n\nSo for the sample:\n\nt_drink = 20 / (3*3) = 20//9 = 2\nt_lime = 80 /3 = 26 (since 80//3 is 26)\nt_salt = 100 / (3*1) = 33\n\nmin(2,26,33) is 2 → answer is 2.\n\nYes, that matches the sample.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\n1. Read the input as integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\n2. Compute t_drink: (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\n3. Compute t_lime: (c * d) // n\n\n4. Compute t_salt: p // (n * np)\n\n5. The answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nSo now, the code.\n\nWait, but what about cases where any of the denominators are zero? But according to the problem statement, the inputs are positive integers, so n, nl, np are at least 1. So denominators can't be zero.\n\nSo the code can proceed safely.\n\nNow, in Python, how to read the input.\n\nThe input is a single line with 8 space-separated integers.\n\nSo, we can read the line, split into a list of strings, convert to integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute t_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nt_lime = (c * d) // n\n\nt_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nans = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n\nprint(ans)\n\nWait, but looking at the sample, the outputs are strings. For example, the first sample's output is '2', '3', '0'.\n\nBut wait, the sample input has three test cases. So is the input multiple lines? Or is the sample showing three different test cases?\n\nWait, looking back, the user wrote:\n\nInput:\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nOutput:\n['2', '3', '0']\n\nSo the input is three separate lines, each with 8 integers. So the code should process each line as a separate case.\n\nWait, but the initial problem statement says: \"The first and only line contains...\" So that suggests that the input is a single line with 8 numbers, but in the sample, it's given as three separate lines.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is written in a way that shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the actual problem expects us to handle multiple test cases.\n\nWait, but the original problem statement says:\n\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nSo perhaps the sample is misleading, but the actual input is one line with 8 numbers.\n\nWait, the sample shows three test cases. So maybe the problem expects us to process multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample is presented as an example of the input, but in reality, the input is a single line with 8 numbers.\n\nHmm, the problem statement says, \"The first and only line contains...\" which implies one line. So perhaps the sample is a typo, and the correct input is one line with 8 numbers.\n\nBut in the sample, the input is three lines. So perhaps the problem expects us to read all lines until EOF, processing each as a separate case.\n\nWait, but the problem says, \"Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases.\" So perhaps the input is a single line, and the sample is just a formatting issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input is a single line, but the sample shows three test cases, implying that the program should process each case.\n\nWait, I'm confused.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\"\n\nIn competitive programming, often, the input consists of multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is that the input is multiple lines, each representing a test case.\n\nBut the initial statement says, \"The first and only line contains...\" which suggests that it's a single line.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the input is a single line with 8 numbers, and the sample is incorrect in showing three lines.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nThat's three lines, each with 8 numbers. So perhaps the problem expects us to read multiple test cases, each on their own line.\n\nIn that case, the code must read each line as a separate test case.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nRead each line, split into 8 integers, compute the answer, and print it.\n\nSo, the code will loop over each line, process each as a test case.\n\nBut in Python, reading from standard input can be done with a loop, reading each line until EOF.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    # process each line\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, line.strip().split())\n    # compute toasts\n    t_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n    t_lime = (c * d) // n\n    t_salt = p // (n * np)\n    ans = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n    print(ans)\n\nWait, but the sample output is ['2', '3', '0'], which seems to suggest that each test case's output is a single string.\n\nYes, because in the sample, each line's output is a single character string.\n\nSo for each test case, we print the integer as a string.\n\nSo the code above would work.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → drink: 4*5=20. Each toast needs 3*3=9ml → 20//9=2.\n\nc=10, d=8 → 80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices →80//3=26.\n\np=100, np=1 → each toast needs 3*1=3g →100//3=33.\n\nmin(2,26,33)=2 → output '2'.\n\nTest case 2:\n\n5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\n\nn=5.\n\nt_drink: 100 *10 =1000, divided by (5 *4)=20 →1000//20=50.\n\nt_lime:1 *19=19, divided by5 →3 (since 19//5=3).\n\nt_salt:90 / (5*3)=90/15=6.\n\nmin(50,3,6)=3 → output '3'.\n\nTest case3:\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → drink is 1e6. Each toast needs 10*50=500 →1e6//500=2000.\n\nc=25, d=23 →575 slices. Each toast needs 10 →575//10=57.\n\np=1. np=1 → each toast needs 10*1=10 →1//10=0.\n\nSo min(2000,57,0) is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nThus, the code reads each line, processes it, computes the three toasts, takes the min, and prints as a string.\n\nI think that's the correct approach.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem Requirements**: Each friend needs a certain amount of drink, one lime slice, and a specific amount of salt per toast. We need to calculate the maximum number of toasts each friend can make based on the available resources.\n2. **Calculate Resource Constraints**:\n   - **Drink**: The total amount of drink available is the product of the number of bottles and the milliliters per bottle. Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters of drink, where `n` is the number of friends and `nl` is the drink required per friend per toast.\n   - **Lime Slices**: The total number of lime slices is the product of the number of limes and slices per lime. Each toast requires `n` slices.\n   - **Salt**: The total amount of salt available is given. Each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt, where `np` is the salt required per friend per toast.\n3. **Determine Maximum Toasts**: For each resource, compute the maximum number of toasts possible and take the minimum of these values to ensure all friends can toast equally.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        # Calculate maximum toasts based on each resource\n        t_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n        t_lime = (c * d) // n\n        t_salt = p // (n * np)\n        # The answer is the minimum of the three\n        ans = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n        print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a series of lines, each containing 8 integers representing the parameters for each test case.\n- **Calculating Toasts**: For each test case, we compute the maximum number of toasts possible based on the drink, lime slices, and salt available.\n- **Output the Result**: The result for each test case is the minimum of the calculated maximum toasts from each resource, ensuring that all friends can toast the same number of times without any resource running out.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures that we maximize the number of toasts each friend can make while considering all resources.",
