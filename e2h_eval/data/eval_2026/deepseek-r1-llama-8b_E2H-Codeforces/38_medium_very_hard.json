    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about directed graphs and something called p-reachable. Hmm. Let's try to understand the definitions.\n\nA directed graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and they are reachable from each other. So these are pairs of nodes where each can reach the other, and u is less than v. Wait, but in a directed graph, reachability is different. Oh wait, no—wait, no, in an undirected graph, two nodes being reachable implies an edge exists. But in a directed graph, for u to be reachable from v, there must be a path from u to v. But here, the definition says that u and v are reachable from each other. So that means both u can reach v and v can reach u, right?\n\nWait, but the pair (u, v) is considered only when u < v. So for each such pair, we count it once if they are mutually reachable.\n\nSo p is the number of such ordered pairs.\n\nOur goal is to find the minimal number of nodes required to form such a p-reachable directed graph. And then, among all such graphs with that minimal number of nodes, find the maximum possible number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nUnidirectional pairs are defined as ordered pairs (u, v) where u ≠ v, there's a path from u to v, but not from v to u. So these are the pairs that contribute to the asymmetry in reachability.\n\nSo first, let's think about how to model the graph.\n\nI think the key is to model the graph in such a way that the number of mutual reachable pairs (u, v) with u < v is equal to p. And we need to minimize the number of nodes.\n\nLet me think about what structure would give me the maximum number of such pairs with minimal nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) isn't going to work because in a DAG, there are no cycles except self-loops, which we probably don't consider here since u ≠ v.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering a graph that has a certain structure where nodes form strongly connected components (SCCs). Because within an SCC, every node can reach every other node.\n\nBut wait, for each SCC, any pair of nodes (u, v) within it with u < v will contribute 1 to p. So the number of such pairs is C(k,2) for each component of size k, where k is the size of the component.\n\nWait, no: for a component of size k, the number of unordered pairs {u, v} where u < v is (k choose 2). But since our p counts ordered pairs (u, v), that's exactly k*(k-1)/2, which is the same as C(k, 2).\n\nWait, but each unordered pair {u, v} with u < v contributes exactly one ordered pair (u, v). So the total p is the sum over all components of size k of C(k, 2).\n\nSo if the graph is made up of several strongly connected components, each component being a single node (so each node is its own component), then p is zero because for each component, the size is 1, so C(1,2)=0. So the entire graph would have zero such pairs.\n\nWait, but that's not the case. For example, if the graph is a cycle, say three nodes A→B→C→A. Then each pair (A,B), (B,C), (C,A) is mutual. So each contributes 1 to p. So p would be 3, right? But wait, the ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v. So in this case, if A < B < C, then the ordered pairs are (A,B), (B,C), (A,C). But in the cycle, A can reach B and C, and C can reach A. So for (A,C), since A < C, this is counted as 1. Similarly, for (B,A), but since B > A, it's not counted. Wait, no—the condition is u < v. So in this case, for the cycle, the number of such pairs is 3: (A,B), (B,C), (A,C). Because A can reach C directly, so their pair is counted once. So p is 3.\n\nWait, but in the cycle, each node is part of a single component of size 3. So C(3,2) is 3, which matches. So yes, the number of such pairs is the sum over all components of size k of C(k,2).\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the minimal n (number of nodes) such that the sum of C(k_i, 2) for each component i equals p. Because each component contributes C(k_i, 2) to p.\n\nSo the minimal n is achieved when the components are as large as possible. Because C(k,2) increases with k, so for a given sum, using larger components requires fewer nodes.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for example, if p=3, the sum is 3. The largest possible component is 3, which gives 3. So n=3. That's better than having two components, like 2 and 1, which would sum to 1 + 0 =1, which is less than 3. So no, that approach doesn't fit.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me clarify: the sum of C(k_i, 2) across all components should be exactly p. So to find the minimal n, we need to find the set of integers {k_1, k_2, ..., k_m} such that sum (k_i (k_i -1)/2 ) = p, and sum k_i is minimized.\n\nYes. Because each component contributes C(k_i, 2), and the sum of those is p. So the problem is to partition p into a sum of triangular numbers T(k) = k(k-1)/2, such that the sum of k's is as small as possible.\n\nHmm, interesting.\n\nSo for minimal n, we want to maximize the individual k's as much as possible, because larger k's contribute more to p with fewer nodes. Wait, no, because for a given p, perhaps a combination of larger and smaller components may yield a lower total n.\n\nWait, perhaps it's similar to the coin change problem. We want to express p as a sum of T(k) terms, with each term being a triangular number, and find the minimal number of terms (but wait, no, because each term is T(k), and the sum of T(k) is p. We need to find a set of integers k_i such that sum (k_i (k_i -1)/2 ) = p, and sum k_i is minimized.\n\nWait, but the minimal sum occurs when the k_i are as large as possible. Because for a given T(k) = p, the sum of k is k. But if you have multiple terms, each contributing T(k_i), adding up to p, perhaps the sum of k_i is minimal when the k_i are as large as possible.\n\nFor example, let's take p=3. The largest possible T(k) is 3 (when k=3), so n=3. Which is optimal.\n\nAnother example: p=4. The largest T(k) is 3, then remaining is 1, which can't be formed by T(k) (since T(1)=0, T(2)=1, T(3)=3, etc). So 4 can be written as 3+1. But 1 is T(2) minus 1? No, wait T(2) is 1. So 4=3+1, but 1 is T(2) (since T(2)=1). So the sum is 3+2=5 nodes. Alternatively, can we write 4 as 1+3? Or 4 as 4 (if T(4)=6, which is too big). No. So 3+1 is 5 nodes, which is the minimal.\n\nWait, but is there another way? Like 2+2. T(2) is 1, so 2*1=2, which is less than 4. So that's not enough.\n\nWait, perhaps 4 can be written as T(4) minus something? No, because T(4)=6. So no.\n\nWait, perhaps p=4 cannot be expressed as a sum of T(k_i), but wait, 4 can be written as T(3) + T(1) = 3 + 0 = 3. But that's less than 4. So that's not correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's see: for each component, the contribution is C(k,2). So for p=4, perhaps the components are 3 (contributing 3) and 1 (contributing 0), but 3+0=3 <4. So that's not sufficient. So perhaps another way.\n\nWait, perhaps 4 can be written as 2+2. Each T(2)=1, so 1+1=2 <4. Not enough. So maybe 4 can't be expressed as a sum of T(k_i), but that can't be right. Because for example, for p=4, perhaps the graph is two components of size 3 and 1. But that would give 3 + 0 =3, which is less than 4.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the way to get p=4 is to have a single component of size 4. Then C(4,2)=6, which is larger than 4. So that's not acceptable.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the problem says the graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) where u < v and they are reachable from each other.\n\nWait, but in a component where all nodes are mutually reachable, any pair (u, v) with u < v contributes 1 to p. So the total is C(k,2) for that component.\n\nSo the sum of C(k_i, 2) across all components equals p.\n\nSo for p=4, we need sum C(k_i, 2) =4.\n\nPossible options:\n\n- One component of size 4: C(4,2)=6>4. No.\n- Two components: one of size 3 (C(3,2)=3) and one of size 2 (C(2,2)=1). Sum is 4. So total nodes is 3+2=5.\nAlternatively, three components: 2,1,1. C(2,2)+C(1,2)+C(1,2) =1+0+0=1<4. No good.\nOr 3,1: 3+0=3<4. No.\nAnother option: 2+2. Sum is 1+1=2<4. So no.\n\nSo the only way is 3+1. But that sum is 3+0=3, which is less than 4. So that's not sufficient.\n\nWait, that suggests that p=4 cannot be achieved with any combination of components. But that can't be right because the sample input includes p=4.\n\nWait, looking back at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n['3', '4', '0']\n\nSample Output:\n['3 0', '5 6', '0 0']\n\nAh, so for p=4, the minimal number of nodes is 5. So that's the case when the sum is 4.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier analysis, 3+1 gives 3, which is less than 4. How do we get 4?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's think again.\n\nWait, 3+1=4? No, because C(3,2)=3, C(1,2)=0. So 3+0=3, which is less than 4. So that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: 2+2. C(2,2)=1 each, so 1+1=2. Still less than 4.\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach. What if we have a component of size 4, but subtract some edges? No, because the presence of edges defines reachability.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Maybe the problem allows for some components to be not strongly connected, but that's not possible because in a directed graph, each component is a maximal strongly connected component.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think about the minimal number of nodes for a given p.\n\nLooking at the sample:\n\np=3: minimal nodes is 3. Because one component of 3 nodes contributes 3, which is p.\n\np=4: minimal nodes is 5. How? Because 3+1=4 in terms of sum. Wait, but 3 is C(3,2)=3, and 1 is C(2,2)=1. Wait, 3+1=4. So that would require two components: one of size 3 and another of size 2.\n\nWait, C(3,2) + C(2,2) = 3 +1=4. Yes! So the sum is 4, which is p. So the total nodes is 3+2=5.\n\nAh, that makes sense. So for p=4, the minimal n is 5.\n\nSo now, the approach is to find a set of integers k_i such that sum (k_i (k_i-1)/2) = p, and sum k_i is as small as possible.\n\nSo the problem is to partition p into a sum of triangular numbers, each T(k_i) = k_i*(k_i-1)/2, such that the sum of k_i is minimized.\n\nNow, the question is how to find the minimal sum of k_i given that sum T(k_i) = p.\n\nWe need to find the minimal sum of k_i such that sum_{i} [k_i (k_i-1)/2] = p.\n\nSo the approach is to find the largest possible k_i's to minimize the sum of k_i.\n\nLet me think about the process.\n\nEach T(k) is k*(k-1)/2, which is roughly k²/2.\n\nSo to make the sum of T(k_i) equal to p, we can start by taking the largest possible k such that T(k) <= p, then subtract T(k) from p and repeat.\n\nBut wait, that might not yield the minimal sum of k_i. Because sometimes, using a slightly smaller k_i could allow more of them, leading to a smaller sum of k_i.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal approach is to use as few components as possible, each as large as possible, because each component contributes more to p with fewer nodes.\n\nWait, for example, if p=6:\n\nOption 1: One component of size 4: T(4)=6. So sum of k_i is 4.\n\nOption 2: Two components: 3 and 3. T(3)=3 each, sum is 6. So sum of k_i is 6. So option 1 is better.\n\nThus, using the largest possible k_i each time gives a minimal sum.\n\nSimilarly, for p=5:\n\nLargest possible T(k) is T(3)=3. Remaining p=5-3=2. Now, for p=2, the largest possible T(k) is 1 (k=2). So components are 3 and 2. Sum of k_i is 3+2=5. Is there a better way?\n\nAnother approach: T(4)=6 is larger than 5, so no. What about T(3)=3 and T(2)=1: sum is 3+1=4. So total k_i is 3+2=5. So same as before.\n\nAlternatively, could we have two T(3) and subtract one? But 3+3=6>5. So no.\n\nSo the initial approach seems valid: take the largest possible k_i each time.\n\nWait, but what about p=4: as discussed, it's 3 and 2.\n\nYes, which gives sum of 5 nodes.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n1. Find all possible k_i starting from the largest possible down to 2.\n\n2. For each k_i, compute T(k_i) and subtract from p until p becomes zero.\n\n3. The sum of k_i is the minimal number of nodes.\n\nWait, but what if after choosing the largest k, the remaining p is not representable as a sum of T's? Then we need to adjust.\n\nBut according to the sample, for p=4, the sum is 3+2=5.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- Start with the largest possible k where T(k) ≤ current p.\n\n- Subtract T(k) from p.\n\n- Add k to the sum.\n\n- Repeat until p is zero.\n\nSo for p=4:\n\nLargest k where T(k) ≤4 is 3 (T(3)=3). Subtract 3 from 4, p becomes 1.\n\nNow, find the largest k where T(k) ≤1. That's k=2 (T(2)=1). Subtract 1, p is zero.\n\nSum is 3+2=5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: p=5.\n\nLargest k is 3, T(3)=3. Subtract 3, p=2.\n\nLargest k for 2 is 2 (T(2)=1). Subtract 1, p=1.\n\nBut wait, T(1)=0. So now, p=1 remains.\n\nWait, no, because after subtracting 3, p=5-3=2.\n\nThen, for 2, the largest T(k) is 2: T(2)=1. Subtract 1, p=1.\n\nBut now p is 1, which can't be represented as T(k). Because T(1)=0, T(2)=1, etc. So wait, 1 is T(2) - 1? No, no. Wait, no. Because for k=2, T(k) is 1. So after subtracting 1, p becomes 1, but we can't subtract anything else. So perhaps we need to adjust.\n\nWait, this suggests that the initial approach may not always work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when p can't be completely broken down into T(k_i), we need to adjust by breaking some components into smaller ones.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet's think: in the case of p=5.\n\nAfter taking 3 (T=3), p=2. Take 2 (T=1), p=1.\n\nBut now, p=1 is left, which is not representable as T(k).\n\nSo we have to find a way to represent p=1. But T(k) can't be 1 except when k=2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, T(2)=1. So if p=1, we can take k=2, which contributes 1, and the sum is 2.\n\nSo for p=5:\n\n3+2=5, which gives T=3+1=4, but we have p=5, so that's not enough.\n\nWait, this suggests that my initial approach is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the process.\n\nLet me recalculate for p=5.\n\nWe need sum of T(k_i) =5.\n\nWhat's the minimal sum of k_i?\n\nOption 1:\n\nTake k=3 (T=3), then p=5-3=2.\n\nTake k=2 (T=1), p=1.\n\nBut now p=1, which can't be represented as T(k). So this approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternative approach: break down 5 into different components.\n\nWhat's another way to get sum T(k_i)=5.\n\nPerhaps 2+3: T(2)=1, T(3)=3. Sum is 4, which is less than 5. No good.\n\nAlternatively, 2+2+1: T(2)+T(2)+T(1)=1+1+0=2<5.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, perhaps 5 can be written as 4+1.\n\nBut T(4)=6>5, so no.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe 5 can be written as 3+2.\n\nBut T(3)+T(2)=3+1=4 <5.\n\nSo that's not sufficient.\n\nWait, perhaps there's no way to write 5 as a sum of T(k_i), but that can't be the case because the sample shows p=4 can be done.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for a component of size 4, but then subtract some edges to reduce the contribution.\n\nWait, but no, because T(k) is determined by the component's structure. So the component can't be modified without changing its contribution.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the components can be arranged in a way that the sum of their C(k_i,2) is exactly p.\n\nWait, for p=5, perhaps the components are 4 and 1. So T(4)=6, which is more than 5. So that's not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, 3 and 2: T(3)=3, T(2)=1. Sum is 4. So p=4, but we need p=5.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of nodes is n such that (n choose 2) >= p, but that's not necessarily correct.\n\nWait, no. Because in the case of p=3, the minimal n is 3, which is 3 choose 2.\n\nBut for p=4, the minimal n is 5. 5 choose 2 is 10, which is larger than 4.\n\nSo that approach doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is the minimal number such that the sum of C(k_i, 2) across components equals p, and the sum of k_i is minimal.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the minimal sum of k_i where sum C(k_i, 2) = p.\n\nSo, for p=5, the minimal sum would be 5 (for 3+2=5 nodes, which gives 3+1=4, which is less than 5. So that's not enough.)\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: for each possible n, compute the maximum possible sum of C(k_i, 2) that can be achieved with n nodes.\n\nBut that seems computationally intensive, especially since p can be up to 2e5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's possible to model this as a mathematical problem.\n\nLet me think about the sum S = sum (k_i (k_i -1)/2) = p.\n\nWe need to find the minimal sum K = sum k_i.\n\nWe can rewrite S as sum (k_i^2 -k_i)/2 = p.\n\nWhich simplifies to (sum k_i^2 - sum k_i) / 2 = p.\n\nSo sum k_i^2 - K = 2p.\n\nBut K is the sum of k_i, which we are trying to minimize.\n\nWe also know that sum k_i^2 >= (K^2)/m, where m is the number of components (by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality), but perhaps that's not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, for a given K, the maximum sum of squares is achieved when all k_i are as equal as possible. So to minimize sum k_i^2, perhaps we should have the k_i as small as possible, but that's conflicting with our goal.\n\nWait, but wait, for fixed K, the maximum sum of squares is when all variables are as unequal as possible. So to maximize sum of squares, make one k_i as large as possible and others as small as possible.\n\nBut in our case, for a given K, the maximum sum of squares is achieved when one component is as large as possible, others as small as possible.\n\nWait, but perhaps for our problem, the sum of squares needs to be as large as possible to satisfy sum k_i^2 - K = 2p.\n\nBecause sum k_i^2 = 2p + K.\n\nSo for a given K, the maximum sum of squares is (assuming one component is as large as possible):\n\nsum k_i^2 = (K - (m-1))² + (m-1)*1², where m is the number of components.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal K is achieved when the components are as large as possible.\n\nLet me think about the initial approach again.\n\nTo construct the minimal K, we can greedily take the largest possible k_i each time.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize K=0, p_remaining=p.\n\nWhile p_remaining >0:\n\n   k = largest integer where k*(k-1)/2 <= p_remaining.\n\n   K +=k\n\n   p_remaining -= k*(k-1)/2\n\nSo for p=5:\n\nFirst iteration: largest k where k(k-1)/2 <=5 is k=3, since 3*2/2=3<=5. p_remaining=5-3=2.\n\nSecond iteration: largest k where k(k-1)/2 <=2 is k=2 (2*1/2=1<=2). p_remaining=2-1=1.\n\nThird iteration: p_remaining=1. Now, the largest k where k(k-1)/2 <=1 is k=2, since 2*1/2=1 <=1. So p_remaining becomes 0.\n\nSo K=3+2+2=7.\n\nBut wait, does this sum correctly? Because 3+2+2=7 nodes.\n\nBut sum C(k_i,2) is 3+1+1=5, which matches p=5.\n\nBut earlier, the sample for p=4 is 5 nodes, which is correct.\n\nWait, but why does this work? Because for p=5, the algorithm returns K=7, but is that the minimal possible?\n\nIs there a way to achieve sum C(k_i,2)=5 with K=5 or less?\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, let's see: Can we have components with sizes 3 and 2? Sum C(3,2)+C(2,2)=3+1=4 <5.\n\nNo. So we need another component.\n\nIf we take 3, 2, and 2, sum C is 3+1+1=5. So K=3+2+2=7.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's another way. What if we take components 4 and 1?\n\nT(4)=6>5, so that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, 3 and 2: sum is 4, but p=5. So we need another component.\n\nSo the initial approach seems to be correct, but the K=7 seems high.\n\nBut wait, is 7 the minimal K? Or is there a way to arrange the components to have a sum of 5 with K less than 7?\n\nFor example, what if the components are 3, 2, and 1? Then sum C is 3+1+0=4 <5. No.\n\nOr 3, 3: sum C is 3+3=6>5. No.\n\nAlternatively, 4 and 1: sum is 6>5.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the minimal K is 7 for p=5.\n\nBut wait, that seems counterintuitive. How can p=5 require 7 nodes when 5 nodes can form a complete graph with 10 edges, but we need only 5 pairs.\n\nWait, no, because in the complete graph, all pairs are mutual reachable, so p would be 10, which is higher than 5. So we need a graph where exactly 5 such pairs exist.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal K is indeed 7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to arrange the components.\n\nWait, maybe if the graph is not a collection of strongly connected components, but has some structure that allows more efficient packing.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the graph is p-reachable, which is defined based on the strongly connected components. So each component is an SCC, and the number of pairs is the sum over C(k_i, 2).\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nSo, the algorithm is to find the minimal K by greedily taking the largest possible k_i each time.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this algorithm efficiently for p up to 2e5.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the input p.\n\n2. If p=0, output 0 0.\n\n3. Else, compute the minimal K.\n\n4. Compute the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nSo, the first part is to compute K.\n\nImplementing the algorithm:\n\nWe can loop through k from the largest possible downwards, subtract T(k) from p until p is zero.\n\nBut to find the largest k each time, we can compute it as the floor of (sqrt(8p +1) +1)/2.\n\nWait, because T(k) = k*(k-1)/2.\n\nWe can solve for k in T(k) = p:\n\nk^2 -k - 2p =0.\n\nSolution: k = [1 + sqrt(1+8p)] / 2.\n\nSo the largest k is floor((1+sqrt(8p +1))/2).\n\nBut wait, let's test this.\n\nFor p=3:\n\nsqrt(25)=5. (1+5)/2=3. So k=3. Correct.\n\nFor p=4:\n\nsqrt(33)=5.744..., (1+5.744)/2=3.37, floor is 3.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nFor p=5:\n\nsqrt(41)=6.4, (1+6.4)/2=3.7, floor is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for each step, we can compute the largest possible k.\n\nOnce k is determined, subtract T(k) from p, add k to K, and repeat.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nWe can initialize K=0, and while p>0:\n\nCompute k as the largest integer where k(k-1)/2 <= p.\n\nCompute T =k*(k-1)//2.\n\nSubtract T from p.\n\nAdd k to K.\n\nRepeat.\n\nSo code-wise, this is manageable.\n\nNow, the second part: finding the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nIn a p-reachable graph, which is a collection of components, each component is a strongly connected component (SCC) of size k_i.\n\nThe unidirectional pairs are the pairs (u, v) where u can reach v but v cannot reach u.\n\nThese pairs are found within the components and between components.\n\nWait, no. Because if u and v are in different components, then u can't reach v unless there's a path through other components, but in a directed graph, components are SCCs, so if u is in component A and v in component B, and A and B are not connected, then u can't reach v and v can't reach u.\n\nWait, but in our case, the graph is composed of components where all internal edges are present, but no edges between components. Because otherwise, if there's an edge from A to B, then B would be part of A's component, which contradicts the definition of components.\n\nWait, no. Because in a directed graph, if A has an edge to B, then B is in A's component, but that's only possible if B can reach A, which would mean they're in the same component. So the components are such that there are no edges between them.\n\nThus, in the graph, the only edges are within components.\n\nSo, unidirectional pairs can only exist within a single component.\n\nBecause between components, there are no edges.\n\nSo, within a component, some pairs (u, v) are mutual (thus not unidirectional), and others are unidirectional.\n\nBut wait, in a component, all nodes are mutually reachable, so for any u and v in the component, u can reach v and v can reach u. Thus, there are no unidirectional pairs within a component.\n\nWait, that's a contradiction with the note in the problem statement.\n\nWait, the note says that in the first test case, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is zero.\n\nSo perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the problem defines unidirectional pairs as (u, v) where u≠v, there's a path from u to v, and no path from v to u.\n\nIn the context of the p-reachable graph, which is composed of components, each of which is a strongly connected component.\n\nSo, within a component, any pair (u, v) has mutual reachability. Thus, there are no unidirectional pairs within a component.\n\nThus, all unidirectional pairs must come from between components.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the graph is directed, and the components are strongly connected. So between components, there are no edges because if there was an edge from A to B, then B would belong to A's component, which is a contradiction.\n\nThus, between components, there are no edges, so no unidirectional pairs can be formed between components.\n\nThis suggests that in a p-reachable graph, there are no unidirectional pairs. But the sample input for p=3 shows that the maximum unidirectional pairs is zero.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the sample input for p=4, the output is 5 6.\n\nWait, let me look at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n['3', '4', '0']\n\nSample Output:\n['3 0', '5 6', '0 0']\n\nSo for p=3, the output is 3 nodes, 0 unidirectional pairs.\n\nFor p=4, the output is 5 nodes and 6 unidirectional pairs.\n\nWait, that's confusing.\n\nSo for p=4, the graph has 5 nodes and 6 unidirectional pairs.\n\nBut according to earlier reasoning, the graph is composed of components with no edges between them, so unidirectional pairs can't exist between components.\n\nSo how can there be unidirectional pairs?\n\nAh, I must have made a mistake in understanding the structure of the graph.\n\nWait, perhaps the graph is not necessarily a collection of strongly connected components.\n\nWait, perhaps the graph can have a structure where some nodes are in a component, and others are in a chain leading into or out of the component.\n\nWait, but that would imply that those nodes are part of the same component, which contradicts the earlier assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the graph is a DAG, but that would allow for unidirectional pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps the graph is a DAG where each node points to the next, forming a linear chain.\n\nIn this case, the graph is a single component? No, because in a DAG, each node can't reach all others.\n\nWait, perhaps the graph is a DAG consisting of a single component where each node has edges pointing to a subset of the nodes, but not all.\n\nIn such a case, within the component, some pairs are unidirectional.\n\nWait, but then the component wouldn't be strongly connected, which contradicts the earlier notion.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the graph is not a collection of strongly connected components, but rather a DAG where each component is a single node, and edges point from one component to another.\n\nIn this case, the graph is a DAG, and each component is a single node, so there are no cycles.\n\nThus, within each component (a single node), there are no unidirectional pairs.\n\nBetween components, for any pair (u, v) where u is in component A and v is in component B, if there's a path from u to v, then u can reach v, but v cannot reach u unless there's a path back, which would require v to be in the same component as u.\n\nThus, in a DAG, between components, if there's an edge from A to B, then any pair (u in A, v in B) has u can reach v, but v cannot reach u.\n\nThus, in such a case, the number of unidirectional pairs is the number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u is in a component that has a path to v's component, but v is in a component that doesn't have a path back to u's component.\n\nWait, but this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the graph is a collection of chains, where each chain is a directed path, and there are no cycles.\n\nIn such a case, each chain is a DAG, and the component structure is such that each node is in its own component.\n\nThus, any pair (u, v) where u is in an earlier component than v in the chain would have a path from u to v, but not from v to u.\n\nThus, each such pair contributes to unidirectional pairs.\n\nBut this requires arranging the components in a way that allows for the maximum number of such pairs.\n\nBut how does this relate to the p value, which is the number of mutual reachable pairs (u, v) with u < v.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIn a DAG, the number of unidirectional pairs is the number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u can reach v, but v cannot reach u.\n\nThis can be computed as the sum over all possible u and v where u can reach v, but not vice versa.\n\nBut in the case of the graph being a collection of chains, each chain is a DAG where each node has edges to the next, forming a path.\n\nIn such a case, any two nodes u and v where u is earlier in the chain than v will have u can reach v, but v cannot reach u.\n\nThus, for each such pair, we have a unidirectional pair.\n\nSo the number of unidirectional pairs in such a graph is the sum for each chain of the number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u can reach v.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, the p value would be the number of mutual reachable pairs, which in a chain would be zero, because each chain is a DAG.\n\nThus, in such a graph, p=0,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs among such graphs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding p-reachable Graphs**: A directed graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) such that u < v and both u and v are mutually reachable. This means the graph can be decomposed into strongly connected components (SCCs), where each SCC contributes C(k, 2) pairs, with k being the size of the component.\n\n2. **Minimizing the Number of Nodes**: To find the minimum number of nodes, we need to partition p into a sum of triangular numbers T(k) = k*(k-1)/2. The goal is to use the largest possible components first to minimize the total number of nodes.\n\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: After determining the minimum number of nodes, we need to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs.
