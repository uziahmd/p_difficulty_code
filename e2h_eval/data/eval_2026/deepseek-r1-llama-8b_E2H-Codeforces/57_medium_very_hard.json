His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about an Olympiad where participants' results from two tours are given. But the problem is that the teacher only has the points for each tour, not which participant got which. The teacher knows that Vasya's total (sum of his two scores) is at least x. We need to find the best and worst possible places Vasya could have gotten.\n\nHmm. So, the key here is to figure out all possible ways to pair the a_i and b_j such that their sum is at least x, and then determine the best and worst possible rankings he could have.\n\nWait, but how? Because the participants are in a sorted list based on their total points. And if multiple people have the same total, the jury can arrange them in any order, which affects their ranking.\n\nSo the approach is to compute all possible pairs of a and b for Vasya, ensuring that the sum is >=x. Then, for each possible pair (a_i + b_j), we need to see how many participants could have a higher sum, or equal, to determine his rank.\n\nBut wait, since the a and b arrays are given in arbitrary order, perhaps the way to model this is:\n\n1. For each participant, their total is a_i + b_j, but the pairing isn't fixed. So the problem becomes finding all possible pairings where one participant is Vasya with a certain a and b, and others have their own a and b.\n\nBut that seems complicated because n can be up to 105, which makes checking all possible pairings computationally expensive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this by considering that for each possible vasya's score s (where s >=x), we need to compute the maximum number of people who have a sum greater than s, and the minimum number of people who have a sum greater than or equal to s. But that might not capture the exact scenario.\n\nWait, but the best possible rank for Vasya would be when as few people as possible have a sum higher than his, and the worst when as many as possible do.\n\nBut how do we find the possible s for Vasya? Because s must be a sum of a_i and b_j, and for each possible s >=x, we can compute the best and worst possible ranks.\n\nWait, but for each possible s that is achievable by some a_i + b_j >=x, what's the best and worst possible rank?\n\nBut even that might be tricky because s can vary, and the other participants' sums depend on how we pair a and b.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model it is: for each possible vasya's score s (s >=x), find the minimal possible number of participants who have a sum > s, which would give the best possible rank (since rank is 1 + number of people with sum > s). Similarly, find the maximal possible number of participants with sum > s, which gives the worst possible rank.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Generate all possible s values that are possible sums of a_i + b_j, where s >=x.\n\n2. For each such s, calculate the minimal and maximal possible number of participants who could have a sum > s.\n\n3. Then, for each s, the best rank is 1 + min_participants_with_sum_greater_than_s.\n\n4. The worst rank is 1 + max_participants_with_sum_greater_than_s.\n\n5. Among all possible s, we take the minimal best rank and the maximal worst rank.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for each s, the best possible rank for Vasya is when the number of participants with sum > s is as small as possible. So the minimal possible number of such participants across all possible pairings that allow s.\n\nSimilarly, the worst possible rank is when the number of participants with sum > s is as large as possible.\n\nBut how do we compute, for each s, the minimal and maximal possible number of participants with sum > s, given that Vasya's sum is s?\n\nHmm. That's the crux of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for a given s, the minimal number of participants with sum > s is when as few as possible others have sum > s. How can that be achieved? By assigning the a and b in a way that maximizes the sum s for as many others as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps for each s, the minimal number of participants with sum > s is the number of a_i + b_j > s, but that's not necessarily correct because the a and b can be paired in a way that may maximize or minimize this count.\n\nWait, perhaps to find the minimal possible count, for a given s, we can try to pair the a and b in a way that as few as possible of the other participants have a sum > s.\n\nHow?\n\nFor example, to minimize the number of participants with sum > s, we want to pair each a_i with the smallest possible b_j such that a_i + b_j <= s. Because then, other participants might have higher a's left, which when paired with higher b's, could result in more sums >s.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to sort the a and b arrays in a particular way to achieve this.\n\nLet me think: to minimize the number of participants with sum >s, we should pair the largest a's with the smallest b's, so that when we sum them, they are just at or below s, thus leaving larger b's to be paired with smaller a's, possibly staying below s.\n\nWait, perhaps I should sort a in ascending order and b in descending order, then pair them accordingly.\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the optimal way to minimize the count is to pair the a's and b's in such a way that as many as possible have a_i + b_j <= s.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given s, the minimal possible number of participants with sum >s is determined by the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j <= s, plus the rest of the a's and b's.\n\nWait, no, because each participant must have exactly one a and one b. So it's a matter of pairing a and b such that as many as possible are <=s.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum <=s, given two arrays a and b. But in our case, each element is used exactly once.\n\nWait, yes! So the minimal possible number of participants with sum >s is n minus the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can have a_i + b_j <=s.\n\nBecause the maximum number of pairs <=s is the maximum number of participants that can have sum <=s, so the minimal number of participants with sum>s is n minus that maximum.\n\nSimilarly, for the maximal possible number of participants with sum>s, we need to find the minimal number of pairs that can be <=s. Because that would leave as many participants as possible with sum>s.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of pairs <=s is zero, meaning all participants have sum>s. But that's not possible if s is high enough.\n\nWait, no. For example, if s is very high, like higher than all possible a_i +b_j, then all participants have sum <=s. So the number of participants with sum>s is zero.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nLet me rephrase:\n\nFor a given s, the minimal possible number of participants with sum >s is n - maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j <=s.\n\nBecause that maximum is the maximum number of participants whose sum is <=s, thus leaving the rest with sum>s.\n\nSimilarly, the maximal possible number of participants with sum>s is the total number minus the minimal number of pairs <=s.\n\nWait, no. Because the maximum number of participants with sum>s would be when as few as possible have sum <=s. So the minimal number of pairs that sum <=s.\n\nSo, for each s, compute the maximum number of pairs that can sum to <=s. Then, the minimal possible number of participants with sum >s is n - max_pairs.\n\nAnd the maximum possible number of participants with sum >s is n - min_pairs, where min_pairs is the minimal possible number of pairs that can sum to <=s.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about it as follows:\n\nTo find the minimal number of participants with sum >s, we need to maximize the number of participants whose sum is <=s. So the maximum possible number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that sum to <=s. Then, the minimal number of participants with sum >s is n - max_pairs.\n\nSimilarly, to find the maximal number of participants with sum >s, we need to minimize the number of pairs that sum to <=s. So the minimal possible number of pairs is the minimal number of participants that can have sum <=s. Then, the maximal number of participants with sum >s is n - min_pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps this is the right approach.\n\nSo for each s, compute:\n\nmax_pairs = maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j <=s.\n\nmin_pairs = minimum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j <=s.\n\nThen:\n\nbest_rank = 1 + (n - max_pairs).\n\nworst_rank = 1 + (n - min_pairs).\n\nWe need to consider all s >=x, which are achievable by some a_i +b_j.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute all possible s values that are a_i +b_j and >=x.\n\n2. For each s in this set:\n\n   a. Compute max_pairs: the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that sum to <=s.\n\n   b. Compute min_pairs: the minimal number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that sum to <=s.\n\n   c. Compute best_rank_candidate = 1 + (n - max_pairs).\n\n   d. Compute worst_rank_candidate = 1 + (n - min_pairs).\n\n3. Collect all best_rank_candidate and find the minimal among them (the best possible rank).\n\n4. Collect all worst_rank_candidate and find the maximal among them (the worst possible rank).\n\nBut wait, what about when multiple s values are considered? For example, if a higher s allows for a lower best_rank, then we need to take that into account.\n\nYes. So for each possible s (>=x), we compute the best and worst possible ranks, and then select the overall best (smallest) best_rank and the overall worst (largest) worst_rank.\n\nNow, the next step is to figure out how to compute max_pairs and min_pairs for a given s.\n\nComputing max_pairs is similar to the classic two-sum problem. It's the maximum number of pairs we can form where each a_i is paired with a b_j such that a_i + b_j <=s.\n\nThis is a standard problem. One approach is to sort both a and b, and then use a two-pointer technique.\n\nSimilarly, for min_pairs, perhaps the minimal number of pairs that sum to <=s is when as few pairs as possible meet the condition. But how?\n\nWait, to find the minimal number of pairs that sum to <=s, perhaps we need to pair as many as possible that are <=s, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no—wait, to find the minimal number of pairs that sum <=s, we need to pair the a's and b's in a way that as few as possible pairs are <=s. So, for example, if we can find a way to pair all except one pair as >s, that would give the minimal possible number of pairs <=s.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal number of pairs that sum <=s is equal to the total number of participants minus the maximum possible number of pairs that can sum >s.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nEach participant is a pair (a_i, b_j). All pairs must be used.\n\nWe need to find the minimal number of pairs that sum <=s. To minimize this, we want as many pairs as possible to sum >s.\n\nSo the minimal number of pairs <=s is n minus the maximum number of pairs that can sum >s.\n\nWait, but how do we find the maximum number of pairs that can sum >s?\n\nThat's similar to the max_pairs problem, but for sum >s.\n\nSo, to compute min_pairs:\n\nmin_pairs = n - max_pairs_above_s, where max_pairs_above_s is the maximum number of pairs that sum >s.\n\nSo, to compute max_pairs_above_s, which is the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >s.\n\nAgain, this can be done using sorting and two pointers.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor a given s:\n\n- Compute max_pairs_leq_s: maximum number of pairs with sum <=s.\n\n- Compute max_pairs_gt_s: maximum number of pairs with sum >s.\n\nThen:\n\nmax_pairs_leq_s is the maximum possible for a given s.\n\nThus, min_pairs = n - max_pairs_gt_s.\n\nSo, for each s:\n\nmax_pairs_leq_s = compute_max_pairs_leq(s)\n\nmax_pairs_gt_s = compute_max_pairs_gt(s)\n\nmax_pairs_gt_s can also be computed as n - max_pairs_leq_s if the sum is s.\n\nWait, no. Because for some pairs, the sum could be equal to s.\n\nWait, the sum is either <=s or >s. So the max_pairs_gt_s is the maximum number of pairs where a_i + b_j >s.\n\nWhich can be found by computing the maximum number of pairs where a_i + b_j >s.\n\nHow to compute that?\n\nPerhaps, sort a in ascending order, and b in descending order.\n\nThen, for each a_i, try to find the largest b_j such that a_i + b_j >s.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach for max_pairs_gt_s is similar to the two-sum problem.\n\nLet me think: to maximize the number of pairs with sum >s, perhaps we can sort a in ascending order and b in descending order. Then, for each a_i, pair it with the largest possible b_j that hasn't been paired yet, such that a_i + b_j >s.\n\nIf a_i is small, pairing it with a large b_j will satisfy a_i + b_j >s.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, for each a_i, find the first b_j in the sorted list (descending) where a_i + b_j >s, and pair them.\n\nThis can be done with binary search.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nSort array a in ascending order.\n\nSort array b in descending order.\n\nInitialize two pointers i=0 (for a) and j=0 (for b).\n\nFor each a_i, starting from the smallest, check if a_i + b_j >s.\n\nIf yes, increment both counts and move to the next a and next b.\n\nIf no, move to the next a (since a is sorted, the next a is larger, which may satisfy the condition with the current b_j).\n\nWait, but this may not work correctly. Let's think of an example.\n\nSuppose a is [1,2,3], b is [10,9,8], s=15.\n\nSo, for a=1, pairing with b=10 gives 11>15? No, 11<=15. So that's not good.\n\nWait, wait, no. 1+10=11 which is <=15. So, it's not part of the max_pairs_gt_s.\n\nSo, we need to find a_i and b_j such that their sum is >s.\n\nIn this example, s=15.\n\nLooking for pairs where a_i + b_j>15.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n3+8=11>15? No.\n\n3+9=12>15? No.\n\n3+10=13>15? No.\n\nWait, none of the pairs in this example are >15. So max_pairs_gt_s is zero.\n\nSo, the minimal number of pairs <=s is n - max_pairs_gt_s = 3-0=3, meaning all three pairs are <=s.\n\nBut perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe the approach is:\n\nFor max_pairs_gt_s, we can use the following approach:\n\nSort a in ascending order.\n\nSort b in descending order.\n\nInitialize i=0, j=0, count=0.\n\nLoop while i <n and j <n:\n\nif a[i] + b[j] >s:\n\n   count +=1\n\n   i +=1\n\n   j +=1\n\nelse:\n\n   i +=1\n\nWait, but this may not work correctly.\n\nWait, let's test with the previous example.\n\na = [1,2,3], sorted.\n\nb = [10,9,8], sorted descending.\n\ns=15.\n\nCheck a[0]+b[0]=11>15? No.\n\nSo, i increments to 1.\n\na[1]+b[0]=2+10=12>15? No. i increments to 2.\n\na[2]+b[0]=3+10=13>15? No. i increments to 3, loop ends.\n\ncount remains 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\na = [5,6,7]\n\nb = [4,3,0]\n\ns=8.\n\nAfter sorting a: [5,6,7], b: [4,3,0].\n\ni=0, j=0: 5+4=9>8 → count=1, i=1, j=1.\n\na[1]=6 +3=9>8 → count=2, i=2, j=2.\n\na[2]=7 +0=7>8? No. So i increments to 3, loop ends. Total count 2.\n\nWhich is correct because:\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n5+4=9>8.\n\n6+3=9>8.\n\n7+0=7<=8.\n\nOnly two pairs meet the condition.\n\nSo, the algorithm seems to work.\n\nSo, the code for max_pairs_gt_s is:\n\ndef compute_max_pairs_gt(a, b, s):\n    a.sort()\n    b.sort(reverse=True)\n    i = j = count = 0\n    n = len(a)\n    while i < n and j < n:\n        if a[i] + b[j] > s:\n            count +=1\n            i +=1\n            j +=1\n        else:\n            i +=1\n    return count\n\nSimilarly, for max_pairs_leq_s, we can compute it as the maximum number of pairs where a_i + b_j <=s.\n\nThis can be done by sorting a in ascending order and b in ascending order, then trying to pair as many as possible.\n\nThe algorithm is:\n\nSort a and b in ascending order.\n\nInitialize i =n-1, j=0, count=0.\n\nFor each a_i in a (starting from the end), try to find the smallest b_j such that a_i +b_j <=s. If found, count +=1, move to next a_i and next b_j.\n\nElse, move to next a_i.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nExample:\n\na = [1,2,3], sorted.\n\nb = [4,5,6], sorted.\n\ns=7.\n\ni starts at 2 (a[2]=3), j starts at 0 (b[0]=4).\n\n3+4=7 <=7 → count=1. i=1, j=1.\n\n2+5=7 <=7 → count=2. i=0, j=2.\n\n1+6=7 <=7 → count=3. i=3, loop ends.\n\nSo, all 3 pairs are counted.\n\nAnother example:\n\na=[1,2,3], b=[10,9,8], s=15.\n\nSort a ascending, b ascending.\n\nWait, a is [1,2,3], b is [8,9,10].\n\nWait, no. Wait, for a_i in a (ascending), and b in ascending.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\ni starts at 2 (a=3), j starts at 0 (b=8). 3+8=11 <=15 → count=1. i=1, j=1.\n\na=2 +9=11 <=15 → count=2. i=0, j=2.\n\na=1 +10=11 <=15 → count=3. i=3, j=3. Loop ends.\n\nSo, all 3 pairs are <=s.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the algorithm for max_pairs_leq_s is:\n\ndef compute_max_pairs_leq(a, b, s):\n    a.sort()\n    b.sort()\n    i = n - 1\n    j = 0\n    count = 0\n    while i >=0 and j <n:\n        if a[i] + b[j] <=s:\n            count +=1\n            i -=1\n            j +=1\n        else:\n            i -=1\n    return count\n\nWait, let me test this.\n\nAnother example: a = [5,6,7], b = [4,3,0], s=8.\n\na sorted: [5,6,7]\n\nb sorted: [0,3,4]\n\ni starts at 2 (7), j starts at 0 (0). 7+0=7 <=8 → count=1, i=1, j=1.\n\na=6 +3=9>8 → can't count. So i=1 is decremented to 0.\n\na=5 +3=8<=8 → count=2, i=-1, j=2. Loop ends.\n\nSo count is 2.\n\nWhich is correct because:\n\n5+3=8, 6+4=10>8, 7+0=7.\n\nSo only two pairs meet the condition.\n\nSo the algorithm works.\n\nNow, the steps are:\n\nFor each possible s (which is a_i +b_j and >=x):\n\n- compute max_pairs_leq = compute_max_pairs_leq(a, b, s)\n\n- max_pairs_gt = compute_max_pairs_gt(a, b, s)\n\n   which is n - max_pairs_leq if s is such that all pairs are <=s.\n\nWait, no. Because compute_max_pairs_gt returns the maximum number of pairs where a_i +b_j >s.\n\nBut in any case, compute_max_pairs_gt can be done as per the function above.\n\nOnce we have max_pairs_leq and max_pairs_gt, then:\n\nmax_pairs_leq is the maximum possible number of pairs with sum <=s.\n\nSo, the minimal number of participants with sum >s is n - max_pairs_leq.\n\nThe worst possible rank is 1 + (n - max_pairs_leq).\n\nWait, no. Because for the worst case, the number of participants with sum >s is as large as possible, which would be when as few as possible pairs are <=s.\n\nSo, for the worst case, the number of participants with sum>s is (n - min_pairs), where min_pairs is the minimal number of pairs <=s.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.\n\nWait, the minimal number of pairs <=s is min_pairs = n - max_pairs_gt.\n\nBecause max_pairs_gt is the maximum number of pairs >s, so the minimal number of pairs <=s is n - max_pairs_gt.\n\nThus, the number of participants with sum>s is max_pairs_gt.\n\nThus, the best possible rank is 1 + (n - max_pairs_leq).\n\nThe worst possible rank is 1 + max_pairs_gt.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, the best possible rank is when Vasya is in the highest possible position, i.e., as few people as possible have a higher sum.\n\nSo, the best rank is 1 + the number of participants with sum >s.\n\nWhich is 1 + (n - max_pairs_leq).\n\nBecause max_pairs_leq is the maximum number of pairs that can be <=s. So the remaining n - max_pairs_leq have sum >s.\n\nThus, the best_rank_candidate is 1 + (n - max_pairs_leq).\n\nSimilarly, the worst possible rank is when as many participants as possible have sum >s. So, the number of participants with sum>s is as large as possible.\n\nWhich is when min_pairs is as small as possible.\n\nBut min_pairs is n - max_pairs_gt.\n\nWait, no. Wait, min_pairs is the minimal number of pairs that can be <=s. Which is equal to the total pairs minus the maximum number of pairs that can be >s.\n\nBecause, for a given s, the maximum number of pairs that can be >s is max_pairs_gt. Thus, the minimal number of pairs <=s is n - max_pairs_gt.\n\nThus, the number of participants with sum>s is max_pairs_gt.\n\nThus, the worst possible rank is 1 + max_pairs_gt.\n\nSo, for each s, the best_rank_candidate is 1 + (n - max_pairs_leq), and the worst_rank_candidate is 1 + max_pairs_gt.\n\nWait, no. Because the best rank is when the number of people with sum>s is as small as possible.\n\nWhich is n - max_pairs_leq.\n\nSo the best possible rank is 1 + (n - max_pairs_leq).\n\nSimilarly, the worst possible rank is 1 + max_pairs_gt.\n\nSo, for each s, we compute these two candidates and track the minimal best_rank and maximal worst_rank.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read input: n, x, a array, b array.\n\n2. Generate all possible s values that are a_i +b_j and >=x.\n\n3. For each s in this set:\n\n   a.

After processing all s, output the minimal best_rank and maximal worst_rank.\n\nBut how to generate all possible s values?\n\nBecause for each possible pair (a_i, b_j), compute a_i +b_j, and collect all unique s >=x.\n\nBut for n=105, this gives 105*105=11025 possible s values, which is manageable.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that it's guaranteed that there exists at least one pair (i,j) with a_i +b_j >=x, so the s list is non-empty.\n\nSo, step 2 is to collect all possible s = a_i +b_j, filter those >=x, and make a set of unique s.\n\nOnce we have this set, proceed.\n\nNow, the question is: in the code, how to compute this.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nRead n, x.\n\nRead a as list of integers.\n\nRead b as list of integers.\n\nCompute all possible s:\n\ns_list = set()\n\nfor ai in a:\n\n    for bj in b:\n\n        s = ai + bj\n\n        if s >=x:\n\n            s_list.add(s)\n\ns_list = sorted(list(s_list))\n\nNow, for each s in s_list:\n\ncompute max_pairs_leq and max_pairs_gt.\n\nCompute the best and worst candidates.\n\nKeep track of the minimal best and maximal worst.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle the compute_max_pairs_leq and compute_max_pairs_gt functions.\n\nImplementing the functions as described earlier.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where s is the same for multiple pairs? Since s_list is a set, duplicates are handled.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n5 2\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nSo, all a_i =1, b_i=1. So s=2 for all.\n\ns_list is {2}.\n\nCompute for s=2:\n\nmax_pairs_leq = compute_max_pairs_leq(a, b, 2).\n\na is [1,1,1,1,1], b is [1,1,1,1,1].\n\nSo, when pairing, all 5 pairs sum to 2.\n\nmax_pairs_leq is 5.\n\nmax_pairs_gt is 0.\n\nSo, best_rank_candidate = 1 + (5-5)=1.\n\nworst_rank_candidate =1 +0=1.\n\nThus, both best and worst are 1, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nInput:\n\n6 7\n\n4 3 5 6 4 4\n\n8 6 0 4 3 4\n\nWait, the second line is a: [4,3,5,6,4,4], third line b: [8,6,0,4,3,4].\n\nWait, but the sample input shows the second line as '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4'.\n\nWait, perhaps the a array is [4,3,5,6,4,4], and b is [8,6,0,4,3,4].\n\nSo, n=6.\n\nWe need to compute all possible s = a_i +b_j >=7.\n\nCompute s_list.\n\nPossible a_i and b_j:\n\nFor a_i=4:\n\nb_j can be 8 →12, 6→10, 0→4, 4→8,3→7,4→8.\n\nSo s values are 12,10,4,8,7,8.\n\nBut 4 is less than 7, so excluded.\n\nSo s=12,10,8,7,8.\n\nSimilarly for other a_i.\n\nBut to avoid duplicates, collect all possible s >=7.\n\nBut this is time-consuming. Let's proceed.\n\nOnce s_list is built, for each s >=7, compute best and worst.\n\nBut according to the note, in the best case, Vasya can have 12 points, which is 4+8.\n\nIn that case, how many participants have sum>12?\n\nOnly Vasya.\n\nSo best_rank is 1.\n\nIn the worst case, Vasya has 4+3=7.\n\nThen, how many participants have sum>7.\n\nLooking at the a and b:\n\nOther participants:\n\nLooking for pairs:\n\n4+8=12>7 → yes.\n\n3+6=9>7.\n\n5+0=5<=7.\n\n6+4=10>7.\n\n4+4=8>7.\n\n4+3=7.\n\n4+4=8>7.\n\nSo, the pairs:\n\nVasya:4+3=7.\n\nOther participants:\n\n4+8=12.\n\n3+6=9.\n\n6+4=10.\n\n4+4=8.\n\n4+4=8.\n\n5+0=5.\n\nSo, participants with sum>7 are 4+8, 3+6, 6+4, 4+4,4+4 → total of 5 participants.\n\nSo, the number of participants with sum>7 is 5.\n\nThus, worst_rank is 1+5=6.\n\nBut according to the sample output, the worst is 5.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, in the worst case scenario, Vasya's sum is 7. How many participants have sum>7?\n\nLet's see.\n\nParticipants:\n\n1. 4+8=12>7 → yes.\n\n2. 3+6=9>7 → yes.\n\n3.5+0=5<=7 → no.\n\n4.6+4=10>7 → yes.\n\n5.4+4=8>7 → yes.\n\n6.4+3=7 → no.\n\nSo, participants 1,2,4,5 have sum>7. So 4 participants.\n\nThus, number of participants with sum>7 is 4. So, worst_rank is 1+4=5.\n\nAh, I see. So my earlier analysis was incorrect.\n\nThus, in code, for each s, the number of participants with sum>s is the number of participants whose sum is greater than s.\n\nWhich depends on how the a and b are paired.\n\nThus, the code correctly computes for each s:\n\nbest_rank = 1 + (n - max_pairs_leq).\n\nworst_rank = 1 + max_pairs_gt.\n\nWhich for s=7, max_pairs_leq is the maximum number of pairs that sum <=7.\n\nWhat's the maximum number of pairs that can be <=7?\n\nLooking at the a and b arrays:\n\na = [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n\nb = [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n\nWe need to pair as many as possible with sum <=7.\n\nLet's try:\n\nPair 5 with 0 →5+0=5<=7.\n\nPair 3 with 4 →7.\n\nPair 4 with 3 →7.\n\nPair 4 with4 →8>7 → cannot.\n\nPair 6 with 4 →10>7 → no.\n\nPair 4 with4 →8>7 → no.\n\nWait, perhaps another way.\n\nAlternative pairing:\n\nPair 3 with 4 →7.\n\nPair 4 with 3 →7.\n\nPair 5 with 0 →5.\n\nPair 4 with4 →8>7 → can't include.\n\nPair 6 with 0 →6+0=6<=7.\n\nPair 4 with 0 →4+0=4<=7.\n\nWait, but each a and b must be used exactly once.\n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum number of pairs <=7 is 4.\n\nBecause:\n\nPair 5+0=5.\n\n3+4=7.\n\n4+3=7.\n\n6+0=6.\n\n4+4=8>7 → no.\n\nSo, four pairs.\n\nThus, max_pairs_leq=4.\n\nSo, n=6.\n\nbest_rank_candidate=1 + (6-4)=3.\n\nworst_rank_candidate=1 + max_pairs_gt.\n\nWhat's max_pairs_gt?\n\nWhich is the maximum number of pairs >7.\n\nWhich is 6-4=2.\n\nSo, worst_rank_candidate=1+2=3.\n\nBut according to the sample, the worst is 5.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, the sample says in the worst case, Vasya is 5th.\n\nWhich means, 4 participants have sum>7.\n\nThus, for s=7, the number of participants with sum>7 is 4.\n\nWhich implies that max_pairs_gt is 4.\n\nBut according to the code, for s=7:\n\nmax_pairs_leq is the maximum number of pairs <=7.\n\nWhich is 4.\n\nThus, max_pairs_gt =6-4=2.\n\nThus, worst_rank_candidate is 3.\n\nBut sample says worst is 5.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is wrong. Because for the worst possible rank, the number of participants with sum >s is as large as possible, which is not necessarily n - max_pairs_leq.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think differently.\n\nWait, in the worst case scenario for Vasya, the teacher wants to arrange the participants in a way that as many as possible have sum >s. So, the worst possible rank is 1 plus the maximum possible number of participants with sum >s.\n\nThus, the problem is to find, for a given s, the maximum possible number of participants with sum >s.\n\nHow to compute that?\n\nThis is the key.\n\nBecause in the worst case, the teacher will arrange the participants such that as many as possible have sum >s.\n\nWhich is equivalent to finding the maximum number of participants that can have sum >s, given that Vasya's sum is s.\n\nThus, for a given s, the maximum number of participants with sum >s is the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can sum >s.\n\nWhich is exactly the max_pairs_gt.\n\nThus, the worst_rank is 1 + max_pairs_gt.\n\nIn the sample case where s=7:\n\nmax_pairs_gt is 2, so worst_rank is 3.\n\nBut the sample says that in the worst case, Vasya is 5th.\n\nWhich suggests that there are 4 participants with sum>7.\n\nSo, why is this discrepancy?\n\nBecause perhaps the approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to compute max_pairs_gt is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not considering all possible pairings.\n\nIn the sample:\n\nn=6, s=7.\n\nCompute max_pairs_gt.\n\nWe need to find the maximum number of pairs where a_i + b_j >7.\n\nSo, let's see.\n\nThe a array is [4,3,5,6,4,4], and the b array is [8,6,0,4,3,4].\n\nWe need to pair as many as possible a_i and b_j such that a_i +b_j >7.\n\nWhat's the maximum possible?\n\nLet's see:\n\nPair 6 with 4:6+4=10>7.\n\nPair 4 with6:4+6=10>7.\n\nPair 5 with6:5+6=11>7.\n\nPair 4 with8:4+8=12>7.\n\nPair 3 with8:3+8=11>7.\n\nPair 4 with4:4+4=8>7.\n\nWait, but each a and b can be used once.\n\nLet me try to find the maximum number.\n\nOption 1:\n\nPair 6 with4 →10>7.\n\nPair 5 with6 →5+6=11>7.\n\nPair 4 with8 →12>7.\n\nPair 3 with6 →3+6=9>7.\n\nPair 4 with4 →4+4=8>7.\n\nPair 4 with3 →4+3=7>7? No, 7 is not >7.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not possible.\n\nWait, but how to pair:\n\nWe need to choose as many as possible pairs where sum>7.\n\nLet's try:\n\n- Pair 6 with8 →14>7. But 8 is in b.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the a is [4,3,5,6,4,4], b is [8,6,0,4,3,4].\n\nWait, perhaps I can pair 6 (a) with 8 (b) →14>7.\n\n5 (a) with6 (b) →11>7.\n\n4 (a) with4 (b) →8>7.\n\n4 (a) with4 (b) →8>7.\n\n3 (a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours.
