There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck but let's try to think through it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on a street with certain spots. Each spot can have a house of height between 0 and h. Each house contributes a squared value to the profit. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in a certain range [l_i, r_i], the tallest house must be at most x_i. My goal is to maximize the total profit by choosing the heights optimally.\n\nHmm. So, how do I model this? It feels like an optimization problem with constraints. The variables are the heights of each spot, and the constraints are the m restrictions.\n\nWait, but with n up to 50, maybe a dynamic programming approach is feasible. Because for each spot, the choice of height depends on the previous choices, especially because some ranges might overlap.\n\nBut considering all possibilities might be too slow. Let me think about the possible approaches.\n\nAlternative idea: For each spot, determine the maximum possible height it can take, subject to all the restrictions that apply to it. Because each spot is covered by some restrictions, and the height at each spot must satisfy all applicable restrictions.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the restrictions are on ranges. So, if a spot is part of multiple restrictions, each of those restrictions may impose a maximum height on that spot. So the actual maximum height allowed for a spot is the minimum of all the x_i's for the restrictions that include it, as well as h.\n\nSo for each spot i, the maximum possible height is min( h, min{ x_j for all j where l_j <= i <= r_j } ). So perhaps first, I can compute for each spot the maximum possible height based on the restrictions, and then choose the heights within these bounds to maximize the sum of squares.\n\nAh, right! Because if a spot is covered by multiple restrictions, the tightest (smallest) x_i among those restrictions will determine its maximum possible height. So first, we can compute for each spot i, the maximum allowed height, which is the minimum of h and the minimal x of all restrictions that include i.\n\nOnce we have the maximum allowed height for each spot, the problem reduces to selecting for each spot a height between 0 and that maximum, such that the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nBut wait, is that sufficient? Because each restriction is on a range. So for each restriction [l_i, r_i], the maximum height in that range must be <= x_i. So even if each spot has a maximum height, when we pick the heights, the maximum in any of the restriction ranges must not exceed their x_i.\n\nBut that's exactly what the initial step ensures. Because for each spot, the maximum possible height is the minimum of all applicable x's and h. So when we select the heights, each spot is chosen within that maximum, and thus any restriction's x_i is at least the maximum height in its range.\n\nWait no. Because the maximum in the range could be higher than the individual spot's max. Oh, wait, no. Because each spot's max is already the minimum of all applicable x's. So for any restriction [l..r], the maximum height in that range is the maximum of the selected heights in l..r. But each spot's height is at most its computed maximum. So the maximum in the range is the maximum of these, which is <= the minimal x in that range. Which satisfies the restriction.\n\nWait, no. Suppose a restriction is [2..3], x=5. Then for spots 2 and 3, their computed maximums could be 4 and 6 respectively. Wait, that would be a problem because spot 3's maximum is 6, but the restriction says that the maximum in [2..3] must be <=5. So our initial approach is incorrect.\n\nOh right! So the initial approach of setting each spot's maximum to the min of all applicable x's is not sufficient because other restrictions on overlapping ranges may require that the overall maximum in the range is lower than some x's.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. So the problem is that the same spot may be part of multiple restrictions. Each restriction imposes that the maximum in their range is <= x_i. So, for example, if a spot is part of two restrictions, each with x values 3 and 5, then the spot's maximum is 3. But if another restriction covers the same spot with x=2, then the spot's maximum is 2. But the problem arises when a restriction's x is higher than the individual spot's maximum, but the sum of the spots' maximums in that range could have a maximum higher than the restriction's x.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because each spot's maximum is the minimum of all x's from all restrictions that include it. So, for a given restriction [l, r], x, the maximum height",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to given zoning restrictions. Each house contributes to the profit based on its height squared, and each restriction limits the maximum height within a specific range.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Restrictions**: Each restriction specifies a range of spots and a maximum height allowed within that range. The challenge is to ensure that for each restriction, the tallest house in its range does not exceed the specified height.\n\n2. **Compute Maximum Allowed Heights**: For each spot, determine the maximum possible height it can have. This is determined by the minimum of all applicable restriction heights and the global maximum height `h`.\n\n3. **Maximize Profit with Dynamic Programming**: Use dynamic programming to find the optimal height for each spot, ensuring that the sum of squares of heights is maximized while respecting the computed maximum heights.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read input\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(data[idx])\n    h = int(data[idx+1])\n    m = int(data[idx+2])\n    idx += 3\n    \n    restrictions = []\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l = int(data[idx])-1  # convert to 0-based\n        r = int(data[idx+1])-1\n        x = int(data[idx+2])\n        restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n        idx +=3\n    \n    # Compute for each spot the maximum possible height based on all applicable restrictions\n    max_heights = [h] * n\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n        min_x = min(x, h)\n        for i in range(l, r+1):\n            if min_x < max_heights[i]:\n                max_heights[i] = min_x\n    \n    # Now, each spot's max height is the minimum of all restrictions' x that include it, and h\n    # Now, the problem reduces to selecting heights for each spot within their max, but ensuring that any restriction's x is not exceeded\n    \n    # So, for each restriction, the maximum in [l..r] must be <= x_i\n    # But since each spot's max is the min of all x's including itself, the maximum in any [l..r] will be <= the min x in that range\n    # Wait, no. Because a restriction could be overlapping with others, and the min x could be higher than some individual spot's max, but lower than others.\n    \n    # Hmm, perhaps the initial approach is not sufficient because the max in a range could be higher than the restriction's x.\n    \n    # So, perhaps the problem is more complex than just considering each spot's max, and we need to model the constraints more carefully.\n    \n    # Alternative approach: model the problem as constraints on the ranges, ensuring that for each restriction, the maximum in the range is <= x_i.\n    \n    # But how to model that?
