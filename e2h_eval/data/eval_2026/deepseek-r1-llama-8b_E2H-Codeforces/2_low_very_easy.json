Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter 'X'. Hmm, let's think about what the problem says.\n\nThe conditions for it being an X are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter all along.\n2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must be the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nWait, right. So first, I need to check the two main diagonals. For each cell in both diagonals, they should all be the same character. Let's call that the 'X' character.\n\nThen, all the other cells (non-diagonal) should have the same character, which can't be the same as the diagonal one. So, I'll need to check two things: whether the diagonals are uniform and whether the non-diagonal cells are uniform and different.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the input. The first line is n, then n lines each with n characters.\n2. For each row in the grid, process each character.\n3. Check the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left). All characters in these diagonals should be the same.\n4. Then, collect all the other characters (non-diagonal) and see if they're all the same and not equal to the diagonal character.\n\nWait, but wait—what about when n is 1? Oh, no, because n is at least 3 and odd. So n starts at 3.\n\nSo, how do I get the diagonals?\n\nFor a grid, the main diagonal elements are those where row index equals column index. The anti-diagonal is where row + column equals n-1 (assuming 0-based indexing).\n\nSo, for each grid, I can loop through each cell and check if it's on either diagonal. If it is, add its character to a list for the diagonals. If any diagonal has a different character than others, it's invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach: first, check if all the main diagonal is the same character. Let's say that character is c. Then, check if all the anti-diagonal is also c. If both are same, proceed.\n\nThen, collect all the other cells (not on either diagonal) and check if they are all the same and not equal to c.\n\nBut wait, what if n is 3? The main diagonal is (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). Anti-diagonal is (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So the center cell is part of both diagonals. But for the condition, both diagonals must consist of the same character. So, for example, in a 3x3 grid, the center is part of both, so both diagonals must have the same character.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the diagonals should have the same letters. So, the main and anti-diagonal may share some cells. So for each diagonal, all their cells must be the same. And if any cell is different, it's invalid.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\nFirst, for each cell, determine if it's on the main or anti-diagonal.\n\nWait, no. We can iterate through each cell and for each cell, check if it's on either diagonal. Then, for each diagonal (main and anti), collect all their characters and see if they are all the same. Also, check if both diagonals have the same character.\n\nWait, no. Because the main diagonal and anti-diagonal can't be different. Because both must consist of the same letter. So, for example, if the main diagonal is 'x', then the anti-diagonal must also be all 'x's.\n\nWait, that's correct. So first, check that all cells in the main diagonal are the same, say c. Then, check that all cells in the anti-diagonal are c as well. Only then proceed.\n\nOnce that's done, collect all the other cells (non-diagonal) and check if they are all the same and not equal to c.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read the grid as a 2D array, perhaps. Or maybe just as a list of strings.\n\n2. Extract the main diagonal: for each i from 0 to n-1, take grid[i][i].\n\n3. Check if all these are the same. Let's call this c.\n\n   - If not, return NO.\n\n4. Extract the anti-diagonal: for each i from 0 to n-1, take grid[i][n-1 - i].\n\n5. Check if all these are equal to c.\n\n   - If not, return NO.\n\n6. Now, collect all the cells not on either diagonal.\n\n7. For each such cell, check that they are all the same, say d, and d !=",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter 'X'. The grid must satisfy specific conditions regarding its diagonals and non-diagonal cells.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the size of the grid and the grid itself.\n2. **Check Diagonals**: \n   - Extract the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and check if all elements are the same.\n   - Extract the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) and check if all elements are the same and equal to the main diagonal's character.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**: Collect all cells that are not on either diagonal and ensure they are all the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Check main diagonal\nmain_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    main_diag.append(grid[i][i])\nc = main_diag[0]\nfor ch in main_diag:\n    if ch != c:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n\n# Check anti-diagonal\nanti_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    anti_diag.append(grid[i][n-1 - i])\nd = anti_diag[0]\nfor ch in anti_diag:\n    if ch != d:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\nif c != d:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Now check the other cells\nother_chars = set()\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            continue\n        other_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(other_chars) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if other_chars.pop() == c:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The grid size `n` and the grid itself are read from standard input.\n2. **Main Diagonal Check**: We iterate through each cell on the main diagonal and ensure all characters are the same.\n3. **Anti-Diagonal Check**: Similarly, we check the anti-diagonal for uniformity and compare it with the main diagonal's character.\n4. **Non-Diagonal Cells Check**: We collect all non-diagonal cells and ensure they form a single unique character different from the diagonal characters. If any check fails, we print \"NO\"; otherwise, we print \"YES\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all necessary conditions for the grid to form the letter 'X' as described.",
