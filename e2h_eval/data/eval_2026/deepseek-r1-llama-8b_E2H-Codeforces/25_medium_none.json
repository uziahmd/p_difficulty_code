При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a message being passed through a network that sometimes has an error. When two identical messages are sent consecutively, they might merge into one because of the error. The merging happens at the end of the first and the start of the second, but only if the same characters are there. Also, the length of the merged part must be positive and less than the total length of the message.\n\nMy task is, given a string t, determine if it could be the result of such an error. If yes, output YES and the possible s (the original message before the error). Otherwise, output NO.\n\nHmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, what's the condition for t to be formed by merging two identical messages?\n\nLet me formalize this. Suppose s is the original message. Then t is formed as follows: s concatenated with s, but possibly some overlapping part where the end of the first s and the start of the second s are merged.\n\nWait, more precisely: when two s are sent, they are merged. So t is s + s, but with a possible overlap. The overlap can be from 0 up to len(s)-1. But wait, no. Because the problem says that the two messages are identical, and the error causes them to be merged. So t would be the concatenation of s and s, but with some suffix of the first s and prefix of the second s overlapping and being merged.\n\nSo for example, if s is 'abcd', then t could be 'abcab' if the first character of the second s is 'a' and overlaps with the last character of the first s. Or wait, no: in the example given, when two 'abrakadabra's are sent, the result can be 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (overlapping by one 'a'), or 'abrakadabrakadabra' (overlapping by four letters).\n\nWait, so the way it works is that the two messages s and s are concatenated, but the overlapping occurs between the end of the first and the start of the second. So t is s concatenated with s, but possibly with an overlapping part.\n\nWait, but the way the error works is that when two identical messages are sent, the two messages are merged. So the resulting message t is formed by the first message's end and the second message's beginning overlapping and merging.\n\nSo for s, the resulting t is s + s, but with some overlap. So the maximum possible overlap is the maximum k such that the last k characters of s equal the first k characters of s. And k must be at least 1 and less than the length of s.\n\nWait, no. Because if two messages are merged, t is formed by taking s and s, and then overlapping their end and start. So the total length of t is len(s) + len(s) - k, where k is the length of the overlapping part. Since the overlapping part must be at least 1, the total length of t is 2*len(s) - k, which must be less than 2*len(s) (so k is positive).\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says that the length of the merged part must be a positive number smaller than the total length of the message. Wait, no: the problem says the length of the merged part (the overlapping part) must be a positive number, and less than the length of the message.\n\nWait, looking back: \"Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения.\" So the length of the overlapping part k must be >=1 and < len(t). Hmm, but len(t) is 2*len(s) -k. Wait, no. Because the merged message t is the result of merging two s messages. So len(t) = len(s) + len(s) - k = 2*len(s) -k. But the condition is that k must be positive and less than len(t). So substituting len(t) gives k < 2*len(s) -k → 2k < 2*len(s) → k < len(s). Which makes sense since k can't be equal to len(s), because that would mean the entire s is overlapped, leading to a single s.\n\nSo for any possible k where 1 <=k < len(s), we need to check if the last k characters of s match the first k of s. If so, then t could be s concatenated with s, minus the overlapping k part.\n\nWait, but the way t is formed is by merging the two s messages. So the merged message is the first s, but with the next s's first k characters appended, but the last k of the first s are replaced by the first k of the second s. So t's last k characters are the first k of s.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: For each possible k from 1 to len(s)-1, check if the last k characters of s are equal to the first k characters of s. If such a k exists, then t can be formed by s followed by s, but with the first k of the second s replacing the last k of the first s. So t would be s[0 : len(s)-k] + s[k:] (since the overlapping is k characters). So t is s + s, but the first k of s are not duplicated—instead, they are taken from s again.\n\nSo for example, if s is 'ababa', and k is 2, then s + s is 'ababaababa'. But the merged version is 'ababa' + 'baababa' → wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no. Let me think differently. Suppose s is 'ababa'. Then two copies are 'ababaaababa'. But when merged with k=2, the result is 'ababa' (the first s) ends with 'ba', and the second s starts with 'ba'. So the merged t would be 'ababa' + 'ba' → but wait, no. No, the merged t is formed by taking the first s, but after the last k characters, appending the remaining of the second s.\n\nSo, for s='ababa', k=2: the first s is 'ababa', and the second s is 'ababa'. We take the first s, and then append s's substring starting from index k. So s is 'ababa' → s[:len(s)-k] is 'abab', and s[k:] is 'a'. So t becomes 'abab' + 'a' → 'ababa'? That doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-express this. The correct way is that t is formed by s followed by s, but with the overlapping part merged. So t is the first s, and then the part of the second s that comes after the overlapping. So t = s + s[k:]. So for s='ababa', k=2: s is 'ababa'; s[k:] is 'ba'. So t would be 'ababa' + 'ba' = 'abababaa'? No, that can't be right.\n\nWait, no. Maybe I should model it as t is s + s, but with the first k characters of the second s replacing the last k of the first s.\n\nSo for example, s = 'abc', k=1: s + s is 'abcabc'. The merged version is 'abccbc'? No, that doesn't seem right. Or wait, perhaps the merged version is s without the last k, plus the second s without the first k. So t = s[:len(s)-k] + s[k:]. So for s='abc', k=1: 'ab' + 'c' → 'abc' again. Which suggests that for k=1, the merged t is same as s. Hmm, but in the example given in the problem statement, the first example is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is longer than s='abrakadabra' by 1 character, indicating that k=1.\n\nWait, in that case, s is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). When two such messages are sent, they are merged, resulting in t of length 11 + 11 -1 =21. So t is s concatenated with s, but the last 1 character of the first s is replaced by the first 1 character of the second s. So t is s[:-1] + s[1:].\n\nAh! So that makes sense. So for a given s, t must be equal to s[:-k] + s[k:] for some k between 1 and len(s)-1, inclusive. So the approach is:\n\n1. For the given t, check all possible k values (from 1 to len(t)-1) to see if t can be split into two parts where the first part is s[:-k], the second is s[k:], but s must be such that s[:-k] + s[k:] equals t.\n\nWait, no. Wait, t is the merged message. So t is s[:-k] + s[k:]. So for t to be the result of merging two s messages, t must be equal to s + s, but with the first k characters of s added again. Or wait, no. Because the merged message is s followed by s, but the overlapping k characters are merged, meaning that in t, the last k of s are replaced by the first k of s.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is that t is s + s, but with the first k characters of s added again. Or maybe it's s without the last k, plus s again.\n\nNo, I think the correct way is that t is formed by taking s and then adding s, but the overlapping part is merged. So the total length is len(s)*2 -k. So for t to be formed by such a merge, t must be equal to s + s, but with the first k characters of s (from the second occurrence) replacing the last k of s (from the first occurrence). So t is s[:len(s)-k] + s[k:].\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for t to be a possible result of the error, there must exist a k (1<=k< len(s)) such that t is equal to s[:len(s)-k] + s[k:]. So our goal is to find any possible s such that this equation holds.\n\nBut how do we find s? Because t is given, and s is unknown.\n\nSo, for each possible k, we can try to split t into two parts: the first part is s without the last k characters, the second part is s starting from position k. So for a given k, the length of s must be such that len(t) = len(s[:len(s)-k]) + len(s[k:]) = len(s) -k + (len(s) -k) ) = 2*(len(s) -k). So len(t) must be even? No, because 2*(len(s) -k) = len(t). So len(t) must be equal to 2*(len(s) -k). So len(t) must be even, but depends on k.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor a given k, len(t) = len(s[:len(s)-k]) + len(s[k:]) = (len(s) -k) + (len(s) -k) ) = 2*(len(s) -k).\n\nSo len(t) must be equal to 2*(len(s) -k). So len(t) must be even, but for each possible k, len(t) must be divisible by 2, and len(s) = (len(t)/2) +k.\n\nWait, yes. Because len(s) = (len(t)/2) +k. Because len(t) = 2*(len(s)-k) → len(s)-k = len(t)/2 → len(s) = len(t)/2 +k.\n\nSo for each possible k, len(t) must be even, and len(s) is determined as len(t)/2 +k.\n\nWait, but len(t) can vary depending on s. So perhaps for a given t, we can iterate over possible k values, compute len(s) as (len(t)/2) +k, and then check whether the first part of t (of length len(s)-k) equals s[k:].\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again.\n\nGiven t, which is s[:m] + s[k:], where m = len(s) -k.\n\nWait, no. Because t is s[:m] + s[k:], and m is len(s) -k.\n\nSo len(t) = m + (len(s) -k) = (len(s) -k) + (len(s) -k) ) = 2*(len(s) -k).\n\nSo len(t) must be even, and len(s) = (len(t)/2) +k.\n\nSo for a given t, to find possible s, we can iterate possible k values (from 1 to len(s)-1) but since len(s) is (len(t)/2) +k, which depends on k, perhaps we can iterate over possible k's based on len(t).\n\nWait, but k must be at least 1, and len(s) must be at least k+1, because len(s) = (len(t)/2) +k, and len(t) is fixed.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps are as follows:\n\n1. Iterate possible k values from 1 to len(t) // 2 -1. Because for each k, len(s) = (len(t)/2) +k, and since len(s) must be at least k+1 (because the first part is s[:len(s)-k], which must be non-empty, as k is at least 1), len(s)-k >=1 → len(s) >=k+1.\n\nBut len(s) = (len(t)/2) +k. So (len(t)/2) +k >=k+1 → len(t)/2 >=1 → len(t)>=2.\n\nWhich is fine because len(t) can be as small as 2.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, t can't be empty. So for len(t) = 2, the only possible k is 1. Let's see:\n\nlen(t) = 2 → len(s) = 1 +k. For k=1, len(s) = 2. So t must be s[:1] + s[1:] → which is s[0] + s[1]. So s is a string of length 2. So t must be equal to s[0] + s[1], which is just s. So t must be a two-character string, and s would be t itself. But wait, in that case, when two s messages are sent, they would be merged, so t would be s followed by s, but the first k=1 character is merged. So t would be s[0:1] (which is the first character) plus s[1:] (which is the second character). So t is s[0] + s[1], which is the same as s. So for len(t)=2, the possible s is any two-character string. So for example, t='ab' would have s='ab', but when two 'ab's are sent, they would be merged into 'ab', which is the same as t. So that's allowed.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, in such cases, we should output 'YES' and the possible s.\n\nSo, for each possible k from 1 to (len(t)//2) -1 (but wait, let's see):\n\nWait, len(t) must be equal to 2*(len(s) -k). So len(s) = (len(t)/2) +k.\n\nSo for each possible k, we can compute len(s), and then check if the first (len(s) -k) characters of t are equal to s[k:], which is the part of s after the first k characters.\n\nBut since s is unknown, but t is known, perhaps for a given k, we can construct s as follows:\n\ns must be such that the first (len(s) -k) characters of t form the first part of s (without the last k), and the last k characters of s must be equal to the first k characters of s.\n\nWait, no. Because s[k:] must be equal to the second part of t.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nt is formed as s[:len(s)-k] + s[k:]. So the first part is s without the last k characters, the second part is s starting from k.\n\nSo for a given k, len(t) = 2*(len(s) -k).\n\nThus, len(s) = (len(t)/2) +k.\n\nSo for each possible k, we can compute len(s) as len(t)//2 +k.\n\nThen, we need to check if the first part of t (of length len(s) -k) is equal to the second part (also len(s) -k in length). Because the second part is s[k:], which is the latter part of s.\n\nWait, but s is made up of two parts: the first (len(s) -k) characters and the last k. So the second part of t (after the first (len(s) -k) characters) must be equal to the last k characters of s.\n\nWait, no. Because t is s[:len(s)-k] + s[k:]. So the second part of t is s[k:], which is the last k characters of s. So the second part of t must be equal to the last k characters of s.\n\nBut s's first (len(s) -k) characters are s[:len(s)-k], which is the first part of t.\n\nSo for a given k, we can extract the first part of t as s_candidate = t[: (len(t)//2 +k) -k ] = t[: len(t)//2 ].\n\nWait, len(s) is len(t)//2 +k. So s[:len(s)-k] is t[: len(t)//2 +k -k ] → t[: len(t)//2 ].\n\nAnd s[k:] is t[len(t)//2 : ].\n\nSo for a given k, the condition is that t[: len(t)//2 ] must be equal to s_candidate[k:] → which is s_candidate[k:] = t[len(t)//2 : ].\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's write it down.\n\nFor a given k:\n\n- len(s) = len(t)//2 +k → because len(t) = 2*(len(s)-k).\n\n- The first part of t is t[: len(s)-k ] = t[: (len(t)//2 +k) -k ] = t[: len(t)//2 ].\n\n- The second part of t is t[ len(t)//2 : ] → which should be equal to s[k:].\n\nBut s is constructed as s = first_part + last_part, where first_part is t[: len(t)//2 ] and last_part is the second part of t.\n\nWait, no. Because s is the candidate string. So s must be equal to t[: len(t)//2 ] concatenated with t[ len(t)//2 : ].\n\nBecause s is first_part + last_part.\n\nSo for a given k, the candidate s is s_candidate = t[: len(t)//2 ] + t[ len(t)//2 : ].\n\nThen, we need to check two conditions:\n\n1. The first (len(s_candidate) -k) characters of s_candidate must be equal to t[: len(s_candidate) -k ] → which is always true because s_candidate[: len(s_candidate) -k ] is exactly t[: len(t)//2 ].\n\nWait, because len(s_candidate) is len(t)//2 +k. So len(s_candidate) -k = len(t)//2.\n\nSo s_candidate[: len(t)//2 ] is t[: len(t)//2 ] which is the same as t's first part.\n\nSo the first condition is automatically satisfied.\n\nBut the second condition is that the last k characters of s_candidate must be equal to the first k characters of s_candidate.\n\nWait, no. Because in the merged message, the last k of the first s and the first k of the second s are merged. So the resulting t has the last k of the first s, but in the second s, the first k may be different. Wait, no. Because in the error scenario, the two s messages are sent, and their end and beginning are merged. So the resulting t's last k characters must be the same as the first k of s.\n\nWait, no. Because in the merged message, the last k of the first s and the first k of the second s are merged into t's last k characters. So those k characters are the same as the first k of s.\n\nBecause both are s's, so s ends with x, and starts with x.\n\nSo for the error to occur, the last k of s must be equal to the first k of s.\n\nSo for the candidate s_candidate, its last k characters must be equal to its first k characters.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each possible k (from 1 to len(t)//2 -1):\n\n   len_s = len(t)//2 +k\n\n   s_candidate = t[: len(t)//2 ] + t[ len(t)//2 : ]\n\n   if len(s_candidate) != len_s → skip (though len(t) is fixed, so len_s is fixed)\n\n   check if the last k characters of s_candidate are equal to the first k.\n\n   if yes, then s_candidate is a possible s.\n\nSo for each k, we compute s_candidate, and check if its last k equals first k.\n\nIf any such k exists, then output 'YES' and the s_candidate (the first such found).\n\nElse, output 'NO'.\n\nWait, but why len(t)//2 -1? Because k can be up to len(s) -1. But len(s) is len(t)//2 +k. So len(s) -1 = len(t)//2 +k -1. But k can't be larger than len(t)//2, because len(s) -k = len(t)//2, and if k is larger than len(t)//2, then len(s) -k could be zero or negative, which is invalid.\n\nSo k can be from 1 to (len(t)//2).\n\nWait, len(t) can be anything, but for each k, len(s) is len(t)//2 +k, and len(s)-k = len(t)//2 must be >=1, since the first part is s[: len(s)-k ] which must be non-empty.\n\nSo len(s)-k = len(t)//2 >=1 → len(t) >=2.\n\nSo for k to be valid, len(t)//2 must be >=1 → len(t) >=2.\n\nSo for len(t) <2, it's impossible.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead t.\n\nIf len(t) <2 → output 'NO'.\n\nElse:\n\nfor k in 1 to (len(t)//2):\n\n   len_s = (len(t)//2) +k\n\n   s_candidate = t[: len(t)//2 ] + t[ len(t)//2 : ]\n\n   if len(s_candidate) != len_s → continue (shouldn't happen as len_s is computed as len(t)//2 +k)\n\n   if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n\n       return 'YES' and s_candidate.\n\nAfter checking all k, if none found → output 'NO'.\n\nWait, but why is len(t)//2 the upper limit for k? Because for k up to len(t)//2.\n\nBecause len(s) is (len(t)//2)+k.\n\nlen(s) -k = len(t)//2.\n\nWhich is the length of the first part of s_candidate.\n\nSo for any k, as long as s_candidate's last k equals first k.\n\nSo for example, let's look at the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\nLet's take the first case: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → len(t) is 21.\n\nWe need to find k such that s_candidate's last k equals first k.\n\nFor k=1:\n\nlen_s = 21//2 +1 =10 +1=11.\n\ns_candidate is t[:10] + t[10: ] → t[:10] is 'abrakadabr', t[10:] is 'akadabra' → combined is 'abrakadabrakadabra' → wait, no, wait. Wait, len(t) is 21. len(t)//2 is 10. So t[:10] is first 10 chars, t[10:] is 11 chars.\n\nWait, 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → len is 21.\n\nSo t[:10] is 'abrakadabr', t[10:] is 'akadabra'.\n\nSo s_candidate is 'abrakadabrakadabra' → len is 21.\n\nWait, but len_s is 10+1=11. So len(s_candidate) is 21, which is not equal to 11. So this can't be.\n\nWait, wait, this suggests that my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the formula.\n\nWait, len(t) = 2*(len(s) -k).\n\nIn this case, len(t) is 21.\n\nSo len(s) -k = 21/2 → 10.5 → which is not integer.\n\nSo 21 is odd. So len(t) must be even for this approach to work.\n\nSo len(t) must be even, else no solution.\n\nAh! So the first thing to check is whether len(t) is even. Because len(t) = 2*(len(s) -k) → len(t) must be even.\n\nSo in the first sample, len(t) is 21, which is odd. So no solution.\n\nWait, but in the sample output, the first case is 'YES' with s being 'abrakadabra' → len(s)=11.\n\nWait, len(t)=21. So len(t) must be equal to 2*(len(s)-k) → 21= 2*(11 -k) → 11 -k=10.5 → which is not possible. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm, so perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the merging process.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again.\n\nWhen two identical messages are sent, the result is a merged message where the end of the first message is concatenated with the beginning of the second message. The number of characters that are merged (overlap) must be at least 1 and less than the length of the message.\n\nSo the merged message is formed by taking the first message, and then appending the second message's starting part, but the overlapping part is merged.\n\nSo for example, s is 'abcde', and the second s is 'abcde'. They are merged into 'abcdeabcde', but if the last 3 characters of the first s match the first 3 of the second, then the merged message would be 'abcdeabcde' → wait, no, that's not the case. Wait, no. If the last 3 of the first s are 'cde' and the first 3 of the second are 'abc', then they don't match. So the merged message would be 'abcdeabcde'.\n\nBut if the last 2 of s are 'de' and the first 2 of s are 'ab', then when merged, the last 2 of first and first 2 of second are merged. So the merged message is s without the last 2, plus s without the first 2. So 'abcde' → 'abcd' + 'cde' → 'abcde'? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is that the merged message is formed by taking the entire first message, then appending the part of the second message that comes after the overlapping part.\n\nSo, for example, s is 'abcde', and the second s is 'abcde'. The overlapping is k=2. So the first message ends with 'de', the second starts with 'ab'. Since they don't match, the merged message is 'abcdeabcde'.\n\nWait, but that's the same as concatenating the two s messages.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the example shows that when two 'abrakadabra's are sent, the result can be 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (overlapping by one character) or 'abrakadabrakadabra' (overlapping by four). So in the first case, the merged message is s + s[1:], because the last character of s is 'a', and the first character of s is 'a', so they merge. So the merged message is s[:-1] + s[1:].\n\nWait, so for s='abrakadabra', which is 11 characters, the merged message is s + s[1:] → len is 11 +11 -1 =21.\n\nSo in this case, t is s + s[1:].\n\nSo t is s followed by s, but with the first character of s added again.\n\nWait, but that's not the same as the earlier approach. So perhaps the correct way is that t is s + s, but with the first k characters of s added again.\n\nWait, no. Because in this case, t is s + s[1:], which is s + s without the first character.\n\nAlternatively, t is s followed by s, but the first k characters of s are not duplicated.\n\nSo for s='abrakadabra', k=1, t is s + s[1:] → 'abrakadabra' + 'brakadabra' → 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (length 21).\n\nWait, but that's not the same as s + s, which would be 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (22 characters). So the merged message is s + s minus the first k characters of the second s.\n\nSo t = s + s[k:].\n\nIn this case, len(t) = 2*len(s) -k.\n\nSo len(t) = 2*11 -1 =21.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the general formula is:\n\nt = s + s[k:].\n\nSo for each possible k (1<=k< len(s)), t is s followed by s starting at position k.\n\nThus, for a given t, to find s and k, such that t is equal to s + s[k:].\n\nIn this case, len(t) = len(s) + (len(s) -k) = 2*len(s) -k.\n\nSo len(t) = 2*len(s) -k.\n\nWhich can be rearranged to len(s) = (len(t) +k)/2.\n\nBut since len(s) must be integer, (len(t) +k) must be even.\n\nSo for each possible k, we can compute len(s) = (len(t)+k)/2.\n\nThen, s must be equal to t[: len(s)].\n\nAdditionally, we must have k < len(s) → since k is the amount we're skipping in s.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each possible k from 1 to len(s)-1:\n\n   len_s = (len(t) +k)/2.\n\n   Check if (len(t) +k) is even → if not, skip.\n\n   Check if len_s is integer.\n\n   Then, check if t[: len_s ] equals s, where s is the candidate.\n\n   Also, ensure that k < len_s.\n\nWait, but len_s is (len(t)+k)/2. So k < len_s → k < (len(t)+k)/2 → multiply both sides by 2: 2k < len(t)+k → k < len(t).\n\nWhich is always true because k is up to len(t) -1.\n\nBut also, len_s must be >=k+1 because s has to have at least k+1 characters (since s[k:] is non-empty).\n\nWait, no. Because s has to have at least k characters, because s[k:] is the part after k.\n\nSo len(s) >=k+1? No, s can be of length k. Because s[k:] would be empty.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the merged message's overlapping part must be a positive number, so k is at least 1. So for s[k:] to be non-empty, len(s) must be at least k+1.\n\nWait, no. Because s[k:] is the part after position k. So if len(s) is k, then s[k:] is empty. But the problem states that the merged message has a positive length overlap. So in that case, the second s's first part must contribute to the merged message.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the length of the overlapping part must be positive. So k must be at least 1.\n\nBut when len(s) is k, then s[k:] is empty. So the second s contributes nothing. So the merged message would be s + empty string, which is s. But then the merged message would be s, which is the same as the original. So perhaps that's allowed.\n\nWait, but in that case, the two s messages are merged into one s, which is allowed only if the overlapping part is positive. So len(s) =k → s[k:] is empty. So the merged message is s, which is the same as the original. So the problem statement says that this situation is allowed.\n\nWait, the note says that if the entire message is a simple concatenation of two messages without error, like 'abcd' is considered correct. So perhaps the case where s is k in len, but s[k:] is empty, is allowed as an error.\n\nBut in any case, the approach is to consider all possible k where len(t) = 2*len(s) -k, and len(s) = (len(t)+k)/2.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each k from 1 to len(t)-1:\n\n   if (len(t) +k) is even → len_s = (len(t)+k)/2.\n\n   else → skip.\n\n   if len_s <k → skip (since s must have at least k+1 characters to have s[k:] non-empty? Or no? Because if len_s ==k, s[k:] is empty.)\n\nWait, no. For len_s =k, s[k:] is empty. So t = s + s[k:] → t is s.\n\nSo in that case, when len_s=k, t is s, which is len_s =k.\n\nBut len(t) =2*len_s -k → 2k -k =k → len(t)=k.\n\nSo for example, len(t)=3, k=3. But len_s is (3+3)/2=3 → len_s=3.\n\nSo t is s + s[3:] → s + '' =s.\n\nSo len(t)=3, and len_s=3.\n\nBut then k can't be 3, because len_s must be >=k+1? Or no.\n\nWait, the problem says that the overlapping part must be positive. So k must be at least 1, but len_s can be >=k.\n\nSo for len_s =k, s[k:] is empty. So the merged message is s.\n\nWhich is allowed.\n\nSo in code:\n\nFor each possible k from 1 to len(t)-1:\n\n   if (len(t) +k) is even → proceed.\n\n   len_s = (len(t)+k)/2.\n\n   if len_s <k → skip.\n\n   else:\n\n       s_candidate = t[: len_s]\n\n       if t == s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] → then yes.\n\nSo for each k, compute s_candidate as the first len_s characters of t.\n\nThen, check if t is equal to s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nIf yes, then s_candidate is a possible s.\n\nSo in the first sample case, t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → len(t)=21.\n\nLooking for k:\n\nWe need len(t) +k to be even.\n\nlen(t) is 21, which is odd.\n\nSo for k to be even or odd:\n\nlen(t) +k must be even → 21 +k must be even → k must be odd.\n\nSo k can be 1,3,5,..., up to len(t)-1=20.\n\nWait, but len_s must be (21 +k)/2.\n\nFor k=1 → len_s=(21+1)/2=11.\n\nCheck if s_candidate is t[:11] → 'abrakadabra'.\n\nThen, t must be s_candidate + s_candidate[1:] → 'abrakadabra' + 'brakadabra' → 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → which is indeed t.\n\nSo yes, k=1 is valid.\n\nSo the sample's first case is valid, and s is 'abrakadabra'.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nAnother sample case: 'acacacaca' → len(t)=9.\n\nWe need len(t)+k even → 9 +k must be even → k must be odd.\n\nPossible k's: 1,3,5,7.\n\nCheck for each:\n\nk=1 → len_s=(9+1)/2=5.\n\ns_candidate is t[:5] → 'acaca'.\n\nThen, t must be s_candidate + s_candidate[1:] → 'acaca' + 'caca' → 'acacacaca' → which is len 5+4=9 → correct.\n\nSo t is 'acacacaca', which matches.\n\nSo s_candidate is 'acaca'.\n\nThus, the sample's second case returns 'YES' with s='acaca'.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nAnother sample case: 'abcabc' → len(t)=6.\n\nPossible k's: 1,3,5.\n\nFor k=2 → len(t)+2=8 → even. len_s=4.\n\ns_candidate is t[:4] → 'abca'.\n\nCheck if t equals s_candidate + s_candidate[2:] → 'abca' + 'ca'",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could be the result of an error in a network where two identical messages were merged. If such an error is possible, we also need to find the original message `s` that could have caused this error.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves checking if a string `t` can be formed by merging two identical strings `s` consecutively. The merging process occurs when the end of the first string overlaps with the start of the second string by at least one character but less than the length of `s`.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each possible overlap length `k` (from 1 to the length of `t` - 1), we check if `t` can be split into two parts where the first part is `s` without its last `k` characters, and the second part is `s` starting from the `k`-th character.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Iterate over all possible values of `k` from 1 to `len(t) - 1`.\n   - For each `k`, compute the potential length of `s` as `(len(t) + k) / 2`. This ensures that the total length of `t` is consistent with the merging process.\n   - Check if the candidate string `s` (formed by taking the first `len(s)` characters of `t`) can be split such that `t` matches `s + s[k:]`.\n\n4. **Efficiency Considerations**: The algorithm efficiently checks each possible overlap length and constructs the candidate string `s` to verify against `t`. This approach ensures that we handle all edge cases and constraints effectively.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\n\nif len(t) < 2:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    n = len(t)\n    found = False\n    for k in range(1, n):\n        if (n + k) % 2 != 0:\n            continue\n        len_s = (n + k) // 2\n        if len_s < k:\n            continue\n        s_candidate = t[:len_s]\n        if len(s_candidate) != len_s:\n            continue\n        if s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] == t:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            print(s_candidate)\n            found = True\n            break\n    if not found:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input string `t` is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n- **Immediate Check for Short Strings**: If `t` is shorter than 2 characters, it cannot be the result of a merge, so we immediately output \"NO\".\n- **Iterating Over Possible Overlaps**: For each possible overlap length `k`, we check if the total length of `t` adjusted by `k` is even, ensuring that the candidate string `s` has an integer length.\n- **Constructing Candidate String**: We construct the candidate string `s` from the first part of `t` and check if appending the relevant part of `s` (starting from `k`) reconstructs `t`.\n- **Output Result**: If a valid overlap is found, we print \"YES\" and the candidate string `s`. If no valid overlap is found after all checks, we print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and correctly determine if `t` is a result of the described error and find the corresponding original message if possible.",
