Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Andrew and Eugene are playing a game with string substitutions. The goal is to process a series of substitution queries on a string and then compute the number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again carefully to understand all the details.\n\nThe problem says that each query is of the form \"di->ti\". For each such query, every occurrence of digit di in the string s is replaced by ti. The order of the queries matters because each one is applied in sequence.\n\nFor example, if the string is '123123' and the first query is \"2→00\", it becomes \"10031003\". Then another query \"3→\" replaces all 3s with empty strings, resulting in \"1212\".\n\nAfter processing all queries, we need to compute the numeric value of the resulting string, ignoring leading zeros unless it's the only digit (like zero), and then find its remainder when divided by 1e9+7.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, let's think about how to represent the transformations efficiently. Since the string can be modified multiple times with overlapping substitutions, it's not straightforward to apply each substitution step by step as strings, especially for large n and s. Processing each substitution naively could be inefficient, but given the constraints (s up to 105 characters, n up to 105), even a straightforward approach might work.\n\nWait, but each substitution could potentially change multiple digits at once. So for each query, I need to replace all instances of di in the current s with ti.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read the initial string s.\n2. For each query, replace all occurrences of di in s with ti.\n3. After all queries, convert the resulting string into a number, modulo 1e9+7, handling leading zeros appropriately.\n\nBut wait, applying each substitution step by step might be computationally manageable since the maximum length is 105, and each substitution could increase or decrease the length, but the total steps are 105, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the key steps are processing each query, replacing the digits, and then computing the result.\n\nBut how to handle the substitutions? Because for each query, it's possible that a digit di is present in the current s, and we have to replace each occurrence of di with ti.\n\nAn important point is that each substitution is global for the current state of the string. So for example, after substitution, new digits may be introduced that could be subject to future substitutions.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Start with the initial string.\n- For each query in order:\n   - For each character in the current string, if it's equal to di, replace it with ti.\n   - Update the string accordingly.\n   \nWait, no. Wait, no: each substitution is done on the entire string. So for each query, we scan the entire string and replace every occurrence of di with ti.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for example, the initial string is '123123'.\n\nFirst query: \"2→00\". So in the string, any '2' is replaced by '00'. So '123123' becomes '1' + '00' + '3' + '00' + '3' → '1003003'? Wait, wait, no. Let me see: the original string is 1 2 3 1 2 3.\n\nReplacing 2 with 00: each 2 becomes two 0s. So the string becomes 1 00 3 1 00 3 → concatenated as 10031003.\n\nThen the next query is \"3→\", so replace 3 with empty string. So in the string, each 3 is removed. So 1 00 3 becomes 1 00. But in our case, the string is 10031003. Replacing 3s: positions 3 and 6 (assuming 1-based indexing) are 3s. So replacing them with empty strings gives 1 00 1 00 → 100100? Wait, no, wait: the string is 1 00 3 1 00 3. Replacing 3s: the third character (3) and sixth (3) are removed. So the string becomes 1 00 1 00 → which when concatenated is 100100? Or wait, perhaps the string is '10031003', which is 8 characters. When we replace 3 with empty, the third character is 3, so it's removed. Then the fourth is 1, fifth is 0, sixth is 0, seventh is 3. So removing the third and seventh characters, the string becomes 1 followed by 00, then 1, then 00. So the string is 100100? Or wait, maybe it's 1 00 1 00 → which is 100100, yes.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a series of substitution queries on an initial string of digits and then compute the resulting number modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). Each query replaces all occurrences of a specific digit with a given substring, and these replacements are applied in sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the initial string and the list of substitution queries.\n2. **Process Queries**: For each query, replace every occurrence of the specified digit in the current string with the given substring.\n3. **Handle Substitutions**: Each substitution is applied globally to the current state of the string, which means substitutions can introduce new digits that might be subject to future queries.\n4. **Compute Result**: After processing all queries, convert the resulting string into a number, ignoring leading zeros unless the result is zero. Compute this number modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\nqueries = []\ncurrent_s = s\nfor _ in range(n):\n    parts = input().split('->')\n    di = parts[0]\n    ti = parts[1]\n    # Replace di with ti in current_s\n    temp = []\n    for c in current_s:\n        if c == di:\n            temp.append(ti)\n        else:\n            temp.append(c)\n    current_s = ''.join(temp)\n\n# Now compute the numeric value mod MOD\nif not current_s:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Convert to number, handling leading zeros\n    num_str = current_s.lstrip('0')\n    if num_str == '':\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        num = int(num_str) % MOD\n        print(num)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read. Each query is processed by splitting it into the digit to replace (`di`) and the replacement string (`ti`).\n2. **Processing Queries**: For each query, iterate through each character in the current string. If the character matches `di`, it is replaced with `ti`. This ensures that each substitution is applied globally to the current string.\n3. **Handling Leading Zeros**: After processing all queries, the resulting string is converted into a number. Leading zeros are stripped to form the correct numeric value, ensuring that the result is accurate even if the string starts with zeros.\n4. **Modulo Operation**: The final numeric value is computed modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that each substitution is applied correctly and efficiently, even when dealing with multiple overlapping substitutions.",
