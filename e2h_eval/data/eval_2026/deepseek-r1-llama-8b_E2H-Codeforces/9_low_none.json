Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where Petya wants to sell souvenirs. The goal is to maximize the total cost without exceeding the weight limit m. Each souvenir has a weight of 1, 2, or 3, and a cost. Hmm, I need to find the best subset that fits within m weight and has the highest possible cost.\n\nLet me think about the approach here. Since the weights are small (only 1, 2, 3), maybe we can group them by their weight. Like, keep track of how many of each weight we take, but that's not enough because the order in which we pick items affects the total cost.\n\nWait, perhaps using dynamic programming is the way to go. Because for each item, we decide whether to include it or not, and track the maximum cost up to certain weights.\n\nBut with n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5, a standard 0-1 knapsack approach would be too slow. So we need a smarter way.\n\nWait, another thought: since each item's weight is either 1, 2, or 3, maybe we can precompute for each weight class the most valuable items, sorted in descending order of value per unit weight. Then, for each possible count of 3s, 2s, and 1s, we can compute the maximum cost without exceeding the weight limit.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n1. Separate the items into three groups based on their weight: group1 (weight 1), group2 (weight 2), group3 (weight 3).\n2. Sort each group in descending order of their cost, so that the higher value items come first.\n3. Precompute prefix sums for each group. This will allow us to quickly calculate the total cost for taking the top k items from each group.\n4. Now, for all possible combinations of a, b, c (where a is the number of 3s taken, b is the number of 2s, c is the number of 1s), we check if 3a + 2b + c <= m. For each valid combination, we compute the total cost as sum3[a] + sum2[b] + sum1[c], and keep track of the maximum.\n\nBut wait, considering all possible a, b, c isn't feasible because a can be up to min(k3, m//3), same for b and c. That's potentially O(m^2) time, which is way too much for m up to 3e5.\n\nHmm, maybe we can find a way to iterate through possible a and b, and compute the maximum possible c, then calculate the total cost.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight is 3a + 2b + c <= m, and c can be at most m - 3a - 2b. But c also has to be <= the size of group1. So for each a, we can determine the maximum possible b, and then the remaining weight is allocated to c.\n\nWait, perhaps we can iterate a from 0 to max_possible_a, then for each a, iterate b from 0 to max possible given a, and then calculate the maximum c as min( (m - 3a - 2b), len(sum1)-1 ). Then, the total cost is sum3[a] + sum2[b] + sum1[c]. We can keep track of the maximum.\n\nBut even this might be O((m/3)*(m/2)) = around (1e5)^2, which is 1e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nThat's not going to work. So we need a better approach.\n\nAnother idea: since the weight steps are 1, 2, 3, maybe we can model the problem with a DP that only keeps track of the maximum cost for each weight up to m.\n\nWait, the standard knapsack DP approach is O(n*m), which is 1e5 * 3e5 = 3e10 operations—way beyond what can be handled in acceptable time.\n\nSo that's not feasible.\n\nAlternative plan: since the weights are small, perhaps we can exploit that and find a way to compute the DP more efficiently.\n\nWait, let's think about the state of the DP. Let dp[i] be the maximum cost achievable with a total weight of i.\n\nInitially, dp[0] = 0.\n\nFor each item, we have wi and ci. For each possible j from current_max_weight down to wi, we can update dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - wi] + ci).\n\nBut with n=1e5, and m=3e5, this would be 3e5 * 1e5 = 3e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo this approach won't work.\n\nWe need a smarter way. Maybe grouping similar items.\n\nWait, since all items",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry without exceeding a given weight limit. Each souvenir has a weight of 1, 2, or 3, and a corresponding cost. The goal is to find the optimal subset of souvenirs that maximizes the total cost while respecting the weight constraint.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Categorize Souvenirs**: Separate the souvenirs into three groups based on their weights: group1 for weight 1, group2 for weight 2, and group3 for weight 3.\n\n2. **Sort and Compute Prefix Sums**: Sort each group in descending order of their costs. Compute prefix sums for each sorted group to quickly calculate the total cost for taking the top k items from each group.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Combinations**: For each possible number of items taken from group3 (weight 3), compute the remaining weight capacity and determine the maximum number of items that can be taken from group2 (weight 2). For each valid combination of items from group3 and group2, compute the maximum number of items that can be taken from group1 (weight 1) within the remaining weight capacity. Calculate the total cost for each valid combination and keep track of the maximum cost.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    m = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    \n    group1 = []\n    group2 = []\n    group3 = []\n    \n    for _ in range(n):\n        w = int(input[idx])\n        c = int(input[idx+1])\n        idx += 2\n        if w == 1:\n            group1.append(c)\n        elif w == 2:\n            group2.append(c)\n        else:\n            group3.append(c)\n    \n    # Sort each group in descending order and compute prefix sums\n    group1.sort(reverse=True)\n    group2.sort(reverse=True)\n    group3.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    sum1 = [0]\n    for c in group1:\n        sum1.append(sum1[-1] + c)\n    \n    sum2 = [0]\n    for c in group2:\n        sum2.append(sum2[-1] + c)\n    \n    sum3 = [0]\n    for c in group3:\n        sum3.append(sum3[-1] + c)\n    \n    max_cost = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over possible a (number of 3s)\n    max_a = min(len(group3), m // 3)\n    for a in range(max_a + 1):\n        remaining_weight = m - 3 * a\n        if remaining_weight < 0:\n            continue\n        \n        # Now iterate over possible b (number of 2s)\n        max_b = min(len(group2), remaining_weight // 2)\n        for b in range(max_b + 1):\n            current_weight = 3 * a + 2 * b\n            if current_weight > m:\n                continue\n            remaining_weight_after_abc = m - current_weight\n            c = min(remaining_weight_after_abc, len(group1))\n            total = sum3[a] + sum2[b] + sum1[c]\n            if total > max_cost:\n                max_cost = total\n                \n    print(max_cost)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Categorization**: Souvenirs are divided into three groups based on their weights to facilitate efficient processing.\n2. **Sorting and Prefix Sums**: Each group is sorted by cost in descending order, and prefix sums are computed to quickly evaluate the total cost of the top k items from each group.\n3. **Combination Iteration**: By iterating over possible numbers of items from the heaviest group (weight 3), then the next heaviest (weight 2), and finally adjusting for the lightest group (weight 1), we ensure that all valid combinations are considered without exceeding the weight limit.
