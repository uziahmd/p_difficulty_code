On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a sequence of numbers representing performers holding rods high or low. Tommy wants to choose an interval [l, r] and reverse the subarray from l to r. Then, he wants to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after this reversal.\n\nHmm, the input is a sequence where each element is either 1 or 2. The output is the maximum LNDS possible after reversing any possible subarray.\n\nWait, but what's the goal here? We need to consider all possible intervals [l, r], reverse them, compute the LNDS for each case, and find the maximum among all possibilities.\n\nBut n can be up to 2000, which is manageable but not trivial. Reversing every possible subarray would be O(n^2) operations. For each reversed array, computing the LNDS could take O(n^2) time as well if done naively. So for n=2000, n^4 would be 16e12 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the sequence. Since each element is either 1 or 2, the LNDS is determined by the arrangement of 1s and 2s.\n\nWait, in a normal non-decreasing sequence, the maximum length would be determined by the number of 1s followed by 2s. Because 1s are less than 2s, so you can take all 1s first, then all 2s.\n\nBut when we reverse a subarray, how does that affect the overall structure?\n\nI think that the optimal reversal will try to group as many 1s as possible before 2s. So perhaps the best strategy is to find a point where, by reversing a certain subarray, the number of 1s before that point plus the number of 2s after that point (or something similar) is maximized.\n\nWait, maybe another angle: the LNDS is the count of 1s up to some position plus the count of 2s after that position, but only if the sequence is arranged in such a way that all 1s come first, then 2s.\n\nBut when you reverse a subarray, you might bring more 1s to the left or 2s to the right.\n\nAlternatively, for any possible split point k (between 0 and n), the maximum LNDS is the maximum number of 1s in the prefix up to k plus the number of 2s in the suffix from k. But wait, because the order matters; if the reversed subarray brings more 1s before k, that's better.\n\nHmm, perhaps for each possible split point i (0 <= i <= n), we can calculate the maximum possible 1s in the first i elements and 2s in the last (n-i) elements, considering that within those ranges, the 1s and 2s can be arranged optimally by reversing some subarray.\n\nWait, but how to model that. Maybe for each split i, the maximum number of 1s in the first part and 2s in the second part. Because if you can arrange the first i elements to have as many 1s as possible and the next n-i elements to have as many 2s as possible, that would give the maximum LNDS.\n\nSo, for each possible split i, we want the maximum number of 1s in the first part and 2s in the second part. The sum of these two would be a candidate for the maximum.\n\nBut how do we compute this for all possible splits?\n\nWait, let's think: the maximum LNDS is equal to the maximum over all possible split points i, where i is the point where the first part is 1s and the second is 2s, possibly after reversing a subarray.\n\nSo for each i, the maximum possible 1s in the first i elements is the number of 1s in the original array up to i plus the number of 1s that can be moved into the first i elements by reversing a subarray that includes some 2s in the first i.\n\nSimilarly, the maximum 2s in the remaining n-i elements is the number of 2s in the original array beyond i plus the 2s that can be moved into that region.\n\nWait, maybe for each i, the maximum number of 1s in the first i positions is the minimum between the total 1s in the array and i. But that's not necessarily the case because reversing a subarray could bring more 1s into the first part.\n\nNo, wait, for example, suppose the original array is 2,1. If you reverse the entire array, you get 1,2. The LNDS is 2, which is the sum of 1s",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray of a given sequence. Each element in the sequence is either 1 or 2, and our goal is to find the optimal subarray to reverse such that the LNDS is maximized.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to consider each possible split point in the sequence and calculate the maximum number of 1s in the prefix up to that point and the maximum number of 2s in the suffix starting from that point. The sum of these two values gives the potential LNDS for that split point. We then iterate over all possible split points to find the maximum possible LNDS.\n\n1. **Precompute Prefix and Suffix Counts**: For each position `i` in the sequence, compute the number of 1s in the prefix up to `i` and the number of 2s in the suffix starting from `i`.\n2. **Calculate Maximum LNDS**: For each possible split point `i`, compute the sum of the maximum number of 1s in the prefix and the maximum number of 2s in the suffix. Track the maximum value of these sums across all split points.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the optimal subarray reversal by leveraging precomputed prefix and suffix counts, resulting in an efficient solution.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\nsuffix_twos = [0] * (n + 1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix_ones[i+1] = prefix_ones[i] + (a[i] == 1)\n\nfor i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n    suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i+1] + (a[i] == 2)\n\nmax_length = 0\nfor i in range(n+1):\n    current = min(prefix_ones[i], i) + (n - i) - suffix_twos[i]\n    if current > max_length:\n        max_length = current\n\nprint(max_length)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: We compute two arrays, `prefix_ones` and `suffix_twos`. `prefix_ones[i]` stores the number of 1s in the first `i` elements, while `suffix_twos[i]` stores the number of 2s from position `i` to the end of the sequence.\n2. **Iterate Over Split Points**: For each possible split point `i`, we calculate the maximum number of 1s in the prefix (up to `i`) and the maximum number of 2s in the suffix (from `i`). The sum of these values gives the potential LNDS for that split.\n3. **Track Maximum LNDS**: We keep track of the maximum LNDS encountered during the iteration over all split points.\n\nThis method efficiently computes the optimal reversal by considering all possible splits and leveraging precomputed counts, ensuring an optimal solution in O(n) time complexity.",
