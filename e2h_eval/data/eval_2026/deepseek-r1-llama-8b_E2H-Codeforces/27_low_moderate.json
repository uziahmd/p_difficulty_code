On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a sequence of performers, each represented by 1 or 2. Tommy wants to choose an interval [l, r] and reverse the subsequence from l to r in the original array. Then, we need to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in this new array.\n\nHmm. The goal is to find, after some reversal, the maximum possible LNDS length.\n\nWait, the LNDS for a given array can be found using a standard algorithm, like the patience sorting method which runs in O(n log n) time. But since n is up to 2000, that's manageable. But here, we have to consider all possible intervals to reverse and see which gives the best result.\n\nBut wait, considering all possible intervals is O(n^2), which for n=2000 is 4 million. For each such interval, computing the LNDS would take O(n log n) time, making the total complexity O(4e6 * 2e3 log 2e3). Wait, 4e6 times 2e3 is 8e9 operations, which is way too much. That won't work.\n\nSo, I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think: what affects the LNDS when we reverse an interval? Well, the order of elements within that interval is reversed. So, for any interval [l, r], the subarray a[l..r] becomes reversed.\n\nThe LNDS of the entire array depends on how this reversal affects the sequences.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a way to precompute for all possible l and r, what is the best possible LNDS when that specific subarray is reversed.\n\nBut even that might be computationally heavy. Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as finding, for each possible l and r, the optimal way to reverse a subarray to maximize the LNDS.\n\nAnother approach: for each possible interval [l, r], compute the LNDS of the modified array and keep track of the maximum.\n\nBut with n=2000, n^2 is 4 million, and for each of these, computing LNDS in O(n log n) is 4e6 * 2e3 log 2e3 = around 4e9 operations, which is way beyond acceptable limits for Python, as each operation is roughly a microsecond, 4e9 would be 4000 seconds—way too slow.\n\nSo this approach isn't feasible. We need a smarter way.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to model the effect of reversing a subarray on the overall LNDS without checking every possible interval.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem.\n\nThe original array consists of 1s and 2s. So the LNDS is determined by runs of 1s and 2s. Because the array is made up of only two values, maybe the problem can be simplified.\n\nIn the original array, the LNDS is the count of transitions from 1 to 2, plus one for each group of 2s. Or wait, more accurately, the LNDS is the number of 1s before each 2, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, for example, in the first sample input:\n\nOriginal array: 1 2 1 2\n\nWithout any reversal, the LNDS is 3: 1,2,2.\n\nAfter reversing positions 2-3, it becomes 1,1,2,2, which has a LNDS of 4.\n\nSo the idea is that by reversing certain parts, we can merge adjacent 1s or 2s, leading to a longer non-decreasing sequence.\n\nSo perhaps the problem reduces to finding a way to connect as many 1s and 2s as possible into a single non-decreasing sequence.\n\nBut how does reversing a subarray help?\n\nLet me think about the impact of reversing a subarray [l, r]. The elements from l to r are reversed.\n\nSuppose in the original array, the elements before l are A, then a[l..r], then B. After reversal, it's A followed by the reversed a[l..r], then B.\n\nWe want to find the arrangement where the entire array's LNDS is maximized.\n\nWait, but since the array is made up of 1s and 2s, perhaps the LNDS is determined by how many 1s are followed by 2s, without any 2s followed by 1s in the optimal case.\n\nWait, no. Because a non-decreasing subsequence can include any elements as long as they are non-decreasing. So, for example, in the array 2,2,1, the LNDS is 2 (the two 2s).\n\nSo, the key is to arrange the array such that as many 1s as possible come before 2s",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray of a given sequence of 1s and 2s.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that reversing a subarray can potentially merge adjacent 1s or 2s, leading to a longer non-decreasing subsequence. We need to efficiently explore all possible subarrays to find the optimal reversal that maximizes the LNDS.\n\n1. **Precompute LNDS for All Subarrays**: For each possible subarray, compute the effect of reversing it on the overall LNDS. This involves checking how the reversed subarray affects the sequence before and after it.\n2. **Dynamic Programming for LNDS**: Use dynamic programming to efficiently compute the LNDS for the modified arrays. This approach helps in reducing the complexity compared to a brute-force method.\n3. **Iterate Over All Possible Subarrays**: For each possible subarray, reverse it and compute the LNDS using the precomputed values. Track the maximum LNDS found.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    # Precompute for each possible l and r, what is the best possible LNDS when the subarray [l..r] is reversed\n    max_lnds = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    \n    # DP[i][j]: the maximum LNDS of the first i elements where the j-th element is the last in the LNDS\n    dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    \n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(i, 0, -1):\n            if a[j-1] >= a[j]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])\n    \n    # Precompute the standard LNDS\n    standard = dp[n][n]\n    \n    # Now, for each possible subarray [l, r], compute the maximum possible LNDS when it's reversed\n    for l in range(1, n+1):\n        for r in range(l, n+1):\n            # Compute the LNDS for the array with [l..r] reversed\n            current = [0]*(n+1)\n            current_lnds = 0\n            # Before l: same as original\n            current[0] = 0\n            for i in range(1, l):\n                current[i] = dp[i][i]\n            # The reversed part\n            reversed_sub = a[l-1:r]\n            reversed_sub.reverse()\n            for i in range(l, r):\n                val = reversed_sub[i - l]\n                if i == l:\n                    current_lnds = 1\n                else:\n                    if val >= a[i-1]:\n                        current_lnds += 1\n                    else:\n                        current_lnds = max(current_lnds, current[i-1] + 1)\n                current[i] = current_lnds\n            # After r: same as original\n            for i in range(r+1, n):\n                current[i] = dp[i][i]\n            # Check the entire array\n            if current[-1] > max_lnds[l][r]:\n                max_lnds[l][r] = current[-1]\n    \n    print(max_lnds[1][n])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precomputation**: We use dynamic programming to precompute the LNDS for all possible subarrays.
