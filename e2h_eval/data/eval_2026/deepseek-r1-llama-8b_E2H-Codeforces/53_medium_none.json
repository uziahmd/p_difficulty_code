    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem correctly. The task is to find the maximum possible length of a substring that occurs two or more times in the input string. The substrings can overlap. For example, in the sample input 'ababa', the substring 'aba' appears starting at position 0 and position 2, which are overlapping.\n\nSo, how do I approach finding all possible substrings and checking their occurrences? Well, one way is to generate all possible substrings and track their starting positions. Then, for each substring, check if it appears more than once.\n\nBut wait, generating all possible substrings might be computationally intensive, but since the maximum string length is 100, it's manageable. So for a string of length n, the number of possible substrings is O(n^2). For each possible length from n down to 1, I can check all possible substrings of that length to see if any occur more than once.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (n-1) down to 1.\n2. For each length l, iterate through all possible starting indices i, extract the substring s[i:i+l].\n3. Keep track of the substrings we've seen using a set or a dictionary. For each new substring, if it's already in the set, then this l is a candidate for the answer.\n4. As soon as we find the largest possible l where such a substring exists, return it.\n\nWait, but for each l, I need to check all possible substrings of that length. So for each l, I can create a dictionary where the key is the substring and the value is a list of starting indices. Then, for each substring in this dictionary, if the list has more than one index, then we have found a valid substring of length l.\n\nSo, the algorithm could look like this:\n\n- For l in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n   - Create a dictionary to map substrings to their list of start indices.\n   - For each i from 0 to len(s)-l:\n       - substring = s[i:i+l]\n       - if substring is in the dictionary:\n           - return l as the answer\n       - else:\n           - add substring to the dictionary with i as the first occurrence\n   - If after checking all substrings of length l none satisfy the condition, proceed to l-1.\n\nThis makes sense because once we find the largest l for which there's a duplicate substring, we can immediately return it without checking smaller l's.\n\nLet me test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abcd'\n\nThe substrings of length 3 would be 'abc', 'bcd'. Both are unique, so no duplicates. Length 2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'—all unique. Length 1: all unique. So the output is 0. Wait, but the output in the sample is 0 for the first case. Oh right, because no substring of length >=1 occurs more than once. So the function returns 0.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says to find the length of the substring that occurs at least twice. So for the first case, since no such substring exists, the output is 0.\n\nWait, but what about the second sample: 'ababa'.\n\nLooking for the longest possible substrings:\n\nLength 4: 'abab' and 'baba'—do they appear more than once? Let's see: only once each. So no.\n\nLength 3: 'aba' starts at 0, and also at 2. So yes. So the output is 3.\n\nThird sample: 'zzz'. Substrings of length 2 are 'zz' (starting at 0 and 1), so the output is 2.\n\nSo the algorithm seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, edge cases: what if the string is empty? But according to the problem statement, it's non-empty, so no need to handle that. What about when the entire string is the same character, like 'aaaa'? Then the longest substring is 3, because substrings of length 3 are 'aaa' starting at 0 and 1. So the function would find that and return 3.\n\nAnother case: 'ababab'. The longest substring is 4? Wait, let's see: 'abab' occurs at 0 and 2. So yes, length 4. So the function would find that.\n\nSo the plan is to implement this approach.\n\nIn Python, I can loop l from len(s)-1 down to 1. For each l, iterate i from 0 to len(s)-l inclusive. For each i, get the substring s[i:i+l], and keep track of the substrings in a set. If any substring is already in the set, return l as the answer.\n\nWait, but using a set might not be sufficient because a longer substring may have been processed earlier. So perhaps for each l, we process all substrings of that length, and for each, check if it's been seen before. So for each i in 0 to len(s)-l:\n\nsubstring = s[i:i+l]\n\nif substring is in the current set, then return l.\n\nElse, add it to the set.\n\nWait, no. Because adding to the set will mark it as seen, but another occurrence later could cause a match. So for a particular l, we have to check every substring. So maybe for each l, create a set, and for each i, check if the substring is in the set. If yes, then return l. Otherwise, add it to the set.\n\nYes, because for a given l, if any substring appears more than once, then l is our answer.\n\nSo, the code structure would be something like:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nmax_len = 0\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(l)\n\n            exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nSo, wait, but in the loop, for each i, we're extracting substr of length l. For each substr, if it's already in seen, then it's a duplicate, so l is the answer. Else, add to seen.\n\nOnce any such substr is found, return l.\n\nIf after all l's down to 1, nothing is found, return 0.\n\nWait, but wait: the outer loop is for l in range(n-1, 0, -1). Because for l= n-1, the maximum possible substring length is n-1. For example, for 'ababa' (length 5), l starts at 4, then 3, etc. So the code as written would process l=4, then 3, etc.\n\nWait, but the code loops from l = n-1 down to 1. So for n=5, l starts at 4, then 3, 2, 1.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample input 'ababa':\n\nWhen l=3:\n\ni=0: substr 'aba' added to seen.\n\ni=1: substr 'bab' added.\n\ni=2: substr 'aba' is in seen → so return 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaa' (n=4).\n\nl=3:\n\ni=0: 'aaa' added.\n\ni=1: 'aaa' is in seen → return 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: 'abcdeabcde' → the entire string is 'abcdeabcde'. So substr 'abcdeabcde' appears once. But substr 'abcde' appears at 0 and 5. So the function would find l=5.\n\nWait, in code:\n\nFor l=5:\n\ni=0: substr 'abcde' added.\n\ni=1: 'bcdea' added.\n\n...\n\ni=5: substr 'abcde' is already in seen → return 5.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when the same substring occurs multiple times, but not the first time?\n\nLike 'abcabcab'. Let's see:\n\nSubstrings of length 4: 'abca', 'bcab', 'cabc', 'abc a'?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not thinking correctly. The code would process each substring in order, and if any duplicate is found, it returns l.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nNow, what about the initial case when the string has length 1? Like 'a'. Then, the code will loop l from 0 down to 1. Wait, no. Because the loop is for l in range(n-1, 0, -1). For n=1, n-1=0, so the loop doesn't run. Thus, the max_len remains 0, which is correct because the substring must appear at least twice.\n\nAnother test case: 'abacab'. Let's see:\n\nWe need to find the longest substring that occurs at least twice.\n\nLooking for l=5:\n\nsubstrings are 'abaca', 'bacab'. Are any duplicates? No.\n\nl=4: 'abac', 'bac a', 'cabi', 'abca' → none.\n\nl=3: 'aba' (i=0), 'bac' (i=1), 'aca' (i=2), 'cab' (i=3), 'bca' (i=4). No duplicates.\n\nWait, but in the string 'abacab', the substring 'aba' occurs at 0 and 4 (positions 0-2 and 4-6?), wait, let me check the indexes.\n\nWait, 'abacab' is 6 letters long.\n\ni=0: 'aba' (indices 0-2)\ni=1: 'bac' (1-3)\ni=2: 'aca' (2-4)\ni=3: 'cab' (3-5)\ni=4: 'b' followed by ... no, wait, for l=3, i can be up to 3 because 6-3=3. So i=0,1,2,3.\n\nNo duplicates in l=3.\n\nl=2: Check all substrings of length 2.\n\ni=0: 'ab' → add to seen.\ni=1: 'ba' → add.\ni=2: 'ac' → add.\ni=3: 'ca' → add.\ni=4: 'ab' → already in seen → so l=2 is the answer.\n\nYes, so the code would find 'ab' at i=0 and i=4, thus returning 2.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nWait, but in the code I wrote earlier, for each l, I loop i from 0 to n-l inclusive. So for l=3, n=5: i runs from 0,1,2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, now, writing the code:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nn = len(s)\n\nif n == 0: # but according to problem, it's non-empty, so skip.\n\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(l)\n\n            exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\n# If no duplicates found, output 0.\n\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but for l in range(n-1, 0, -1): in Python, the end is exclusive. So for n=5, n-1=4, so the range is 4,3,2,1.\n\nWait, but the for loop in Python is for l in range(start, stop, step). So for n=5, the maximum possible l is 4, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: 'abcd' → n=4.\n\nLoop l from 3 downto 1.\n\nFor l=3:\n\nsubstrings are 'abc' (i=0), 'bcd' (i=1). No duplicates.\n\nl=2:\n\nsubstrings 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' → no duplicates.\n\nl=1: all single characters are unique. So code prints 0.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa' → n=5.\n\nl=4:\n\nsubstrings 'abab' (i=0), 'baba' (i=1) → no duplicates.\n\nl=3:\n\ni=0: 'aba' → add.\n\ni=1: 'bab' → add.\n\ni=2: 'aba' is in seen → return 3.\n\nSample 3: 'zzz' → n=3.\n\nl=2:\n\nsubstrings 'zz' (i=0) and 'zz' (i=1) → duplicate. Return 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'abacab' → n=6.\n\nAs discussed, for l=2, 'ab' is found at i=0 and i=4 → returns 2.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nI think this approach is correct and efficient enough for the constraints given. Since the maximum string length is 100, the worst case is 100 * 100 / 2 = 5000 iterations, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the final code is as above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. These substrings can overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Iterate Over Possible Substring Lengths**: We start by checking the longest possible substrings first. This means we begin with substrings of length `n-1` (where `n` is the length of the string) and decrease down to 1.\n2. **Check Each Substring**: For each length `l`, we generate all possible substrings of that length and check if any of them have appeared before.\n3. **Track Seen Substrings**: Use a set to keep track of substrings we have seen so far. If a substring is encountered again, it means we have found a duplicate, and we can immediately return the current length `l` as the result.\n4. **Edge Cases**: If no duplicates are found for any substring length, we return 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(l)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input string is read and its length is determined.\n- **Loop Through Lengths**: We loop from the maximum possible substring length down to 1.\n- **Generate Substrings**: For each length, generate all possible substrings and check if they have been seen before using a set.\n- **Check for Duplicates**: If a substring is found in the set, print the length and exit. If no duplicates are found after checking all lengths, print 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest duplicate substring by leveraging the properties of sets for quick look-up, making the solution both effective and efficient for the given constraints.",
