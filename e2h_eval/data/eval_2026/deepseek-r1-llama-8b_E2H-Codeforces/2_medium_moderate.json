Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. Hmm, let me think about the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, what defines an 'X' in this context? Oh right, the diagonals must all be the same character, and all other squares (not on the diagonals) must be the same different character. Also, n is odd, which means the grid has a clear center.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Read the input correctly. The first line is n, followed by n lines each containing n characters.\n2. Check the diagonals: for both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left), all characters must be the same.\n3. Then, check that all the non-diagonal characters are the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me clarify: the two diagonals must be the same character, and the rest must be another same character but not equal to the diagonal's.\n\nSo, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll extract the two diagonals and see if they're consistent.\n\nFor the main diagonal (let's call it diag1), it consists of grid[i][i] for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nFor the anti-diagonal (diag2), it's grid[i][n-1 -i] for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nI need to check if all elements in diag1 are the same. Similarly for diag2. But also, diag1 and diag2 must be the same character. Because, in an 'X', both diagonals are the same.\n\nOnce I confirm that both diagonals are the same character, I need to look at all other cells (non-diagonal) and ensure they are the same and different from the diagonal.\n\nSo, how to approach this?\n\nLet me outline the plan:\n\n- Read n.\n- Read the grid as a list of strings.\n- For each string, make it a list or just process each row as needed.\n- Extract diag1 and diag2.\n- Check if all elements in diag1 are the same. Let's say the common character is c.\n- Check if all elements in diag2 are also c.\n- If diag1 and diag2 are not both c, return NO.\n- Then, check all other cells (those not on either diagonal) and ensure they are all the same and not equal to c.\n- If all these conditions are met, output YES; else, NO.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, read n. Then read n lines, stripping any newlines or whitespace. So, for example, in Python, using input().strip() for each line.\n\nThen, for each of the diagonals:\n\nFor diag1, collect all grid[i][i]. Similarly, for diag2, collect grid[i][n-1 -i].\n\nWait, wait. Wait, in a grid, each row is a string. So grid[0] is the first row, grid[0][0] is the first cell of the first row.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for i in range(n):\n    diag1_char = grid[i][i]\nSimilarly, diag2_char is grid[i][n-1 -i].\n\nThen, check that all elements in diag1 are equal to diag1_char, and same for diag2.\n\nBut wait, diag1 must consist entirely of the same character. So, if diag1 has any different character, it's invalid.\n\nSo, for diag1, check all elements: for each i, grid[i][i] == c, where c is the first character of diag1.\n\nSame for diag2: all elements must be equal to c.\n\nIf either diag doesn't meet this, return NO.\n\nOnce both are okay, then check the other cells.\n\nNow, what's considered a \"other cell\"? It's any cell that's not on either diagonal.\n\nHow to find them?\n\nFor each cell (i,j), if i != j and j != (n-1 -i), then it's an other cell.\n\nSo, loop through all i and j:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or j == (n-1 -i):\n            continue\n        else:\n            check if all such cells are same as d, where d is not equal to c.\n\nWait, but what if all the other cells are the same as each other, but maybe not the same as c. So, their value must be a single unique character, different from c.\n\nSo, first, collect all the other characters into a set. If the set has more than one element, it's invalid. Also, the set should contain exactly one value, which is not c.\n\nWait, no. The other cells can only have one unique value, and that must be different from c.\n\nSo, for all non-diagonal cells, their characters must be the same, and that character must be different from c.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nd = None\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or j == (n-1 -i):\n            continue\n        current_char = grid[i][j]\n        if d is None:\n            d = current_char\n        else:\n            if current_char != d:\n                # mismatch, return NO\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit()\n\nAlso, after collecting all, check if d is not equal to c.\n\nSo, after processing all non-diagonal cells, if any cell doesn't match d, it's invalid.\n\nAnd also, d must not be equal to c.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead grid.\n\nCheck diag1 and diag2 are same and all same as c.\n\nThen, check all other cells are same as d, and d != c.\n\nIf all these are true, output YES else NO.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=3, grid is:\n\nxox\noxo\nxoo\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the sample input, one of the test cases is:\n\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nWhich is a correct 'X'? Because diag1 is 'w','s','w' — wait no, wait, for 3x3 grid, diag1 is [0][0], [1][1], [2][2], which for the first row is 'w', second is 's', third is 'w' — so diag1 is 'w', 's', 'w' — not all same. So that test case would fail.\n\nWait, but the sample input has:\n\nSecond test case:\n\n3\nxpx\np xp?\nWait, the sample input given was:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nSample output is ['NO', 'YES', 'NO'].\n\nSo, the second test case, n=3, lines:\n\nx p x\np x p\nx p x\n\nSo, diag1 is x, x, x — same. Diag2 is x, x, x — same. So, c is 'x'.\n\nOther cells: all 'p's. So, yes.\n\nWait, but what about the third test case in the sample input:\n\n3\nx p x\np x p\nx p e\n\nSo, diag1 is x, x, x — same. Diag2 is x, x, e — which is not same as x. So diag2 is invalid. So, output is NO.\n\nSo, the approach seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5.\n\nSuppose all the diagonals are 'x's. The other cells are 'o's. So, output is YES.\n\nBut if any of the other cells is different, or the diagonals differ, it's NO.\n\nWhat about when n=1? Well, the problem states n is at least 3.\n\nWait, the input constraints say n is ≥3 and odd.\n\nSo, no need to handle n=1.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in code.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nc = None\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if grid[i][i] != grid[i][i]:\n        # Wait, no, that can't happen. Maybe not necessary.\n\nWait, better to collect diag1 and diag2.\n\ndiag1 = []\ndiag2 = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    diag1.append(grid[i][i])\n    diag2.append(grid[i][n-1 -i])\n\nThen, check if all elements in diag1 are the same.\n\nif not all(c == diag1[0] for c in diag1):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nSimilarly for diag2:\n\nif not all(c == diag2[0] for c in diag2):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nThen, check if diag1[0] == diag2[0]. Because, for it to be 'X', both diagonals must be same.\n\nif diag1[0] != diag2[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nElse, c = diag1[0]\n\nNow, check all the other cells.\n\nother_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or j == (n-1 -i):\n            continue\n        other_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(other_chars) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nd = other_chars.pop()\n\nif d == c:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nSo, if all checks pass, print \"YES\".\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nWait, but wait: in the code, after reading the grid, we have to process each cell.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the way to check the other cells is to collect all non-diagonal cells into a set. If the set's length is 1, then they are all same. Otherwise, it's invalid.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nWait, but what if n is 5, and the other cells are all 'o's except one which is 'p'? Then the set will have size 2, so condition fails.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, that's the plan.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nBut wait, let's think about the efficiency. Since n can be up to 299, and for each cell, it's O(n^2), which is manageable.\n\nNow, testing for the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3\nxpx\npxp\nxpe\n\nAfter reading, grid is:\n\n['xpx', 'pxp', 'xpe']\n\ndiag1: grid[0][0] = 'x', grid[1][1] = 'x', grid[2][2] = 'e'. So diag1 is ['x','x','e'] — not all same. So condition fails, output NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, with all X's on diagonals, and others 'o's.\n\nSo, code should output YES.\n\nWhat about a case where the diagonals are same, but other cells are not same? Like:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\naaa\naba\naaa\n\nDiag1 is 'a','b','a' — not same. So code returns NO.\n\nAnother case:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\naaa\naaa\naaa\n\nThen diag1 is aaa, diag2 is aaa. Then other cells are all a's, same as diag. So code returns NO.\n\nBecause the other cells are same as the diagonals.\n\nSo, the code correctly handles that.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, grid where all diagonals are 'x's, and other cells are 'y's. So code returns YES.\n\nAnother case: n=3, grid:\n\nxoo\noxo\noox\n\nWait, diag1 is x, o, x → same as 'x'.\n\ndiag2 is o, o, x → not same as 'x' → code returns NO.\n\nSo, the logic seems solid.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nWait, in the code, after checking the diagonals, we have to check that all non-diagonal cells are same and not equal to c.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid.\n\nCheck diag1 and diag2 are all same as c and same as each other.\n\nThen collect other chars.\n\nIf other chars are not all same, or same as c, return NO.\n\nElse, YES.\n\nSo, code in Python:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Check main diagonal\ndiag1 = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    diag1.append(grid[i][i])\nmain_char = diag1[0]\nif not all(c == main_char for c in diag1):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check anti-diagonal\nanti_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    j = n - 1 - i\n    anti_diag.append(grid[i][j])\nmain_char_anti = anti_diag[0]\nif not all(c == main_char_anti for c in anti_diag):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check if both diagonals are same\nif main_char != main_char_anti:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Now, check other cells\nother_chars = set()\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or j == (n-1 -i):\n            continue\n        other_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(other_chars) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nother_char = other_chars.pop()\nif other_char == main_char:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but in the code above, after checking the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal, what about if the anti-diagonal's first element is different from main_char? Because, for example, in the first test case, the anti-diagonal may not have the same character as the main.\n\nWait, no. Because in the code, after checking that diag1 is all main_char and diag2 is all main_char_anti, and then ensuring that main_char == main_char_anti.\n\nSo, the code correctly requires that both diagonals are same.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\nxooox\noxoxo\nsoxoo\noxoxo\nxooox\n\ndiag1: x, o, s, o, x → wait, no. Wait, for i=0, grid[0][0] is x. i=1, grid[1][1] is o. i=2, grid[2][2] is x. i=3, grid[3][3] is o. i=4, grid[4][4] is x.\n\nSo diag1 is x, o, x, o, x → not all same. So code returns NO.\n\nWhich matches sample output.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\ndiag1: w, s, w → all same as w.\n\nanti-diag: w, s, w → same as w.\n\nother cells: s, s, s → same as s, which is different from w.\n\nSo code returns YES.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n3\nxpx\npxp\nxpe\n\ndiag1: x, x, e → not all same. So code returns NO.\n\nThus, the sample outputs are correctly handled.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all cells are 'x's.\n\ndiag1 is x, x, x → same.\n\ndiag2 is x, x, x → same.\n\nother cells: none, so condition is satisfied. So output is YES.\n\nWait, no. Because other cells are none, so other_chars is empty. So len(other_chars) is zero, which is not 1. So code returns NO.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the other cells must be same and different from diagonals. So, if there are no other cells, do they satisfy the condition?\n\nIn the case of n=1, but n is at least 3, so for n=3, the grid has 9 cells. The four corners are on the diagonals (each corner is on both diagonals). Wait no, for n=3, the diagonals include all four corners plus the center. So the number of non-diagonal cells is 9 - 5 =4.\n\nWait, wait. Let me count for n=3.\n\nEach diagonal has 3 cells. But the center cell is in both diagonals. So, the total number of unique cells on diagonals is 3 + 3 -1 =5.\n\nSo, for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are 9-5=4.\n\nSo, in a 3x3 grid, if all cells are same, like 'x's, then the non-diagonal cells are all 'x's. So, in code, other_chars will collect all 'x's, len is 1, but same as c, which is 'x'. So code returns NO.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the other cells must be a different character.\n\nSo, in the case where the entire grid is same, it's not an 'X' because the other cells are same as the diagonals.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code correctly handles that.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid is:\n\nxox\noxo\nxoo\n\ndiag1: x, o, x → same.\n\ndiag2: x, o, o → same as o? No, wait, diag2 is grid[0][2], grid[1][1], grid[2][0].\n\nWait, for i=0, j=2 → 'x'.\n\ni=1, j=1 → 'o'.\n\ni=2, j=0 → 'x'.\n\nSo diag2 is x, o, x → same as x.\n\nSo, diag1 and diag2 are same.\n\nNow, other cells: grid[0][1] is 'o', grid[1][0] is 'o', grid[1][2] is 'o', grid[2][1] is 'o'.\n\nSo, all other cells are 'o's.\n\nThus, code returns YES.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, I think this should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules.
