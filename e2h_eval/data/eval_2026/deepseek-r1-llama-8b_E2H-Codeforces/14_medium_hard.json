He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output all those n's in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n, because there are always more 2s than 5s. So for each multiple of 5, we add one zero, but also for multiples of 25, 125, etc., since they contribute more than one 5.\n\nSo the formula for the number of trailing zeros Z(n) is the sum of n divided by 5, plus n divided by 25, plus n divided by 125, and so on until the division result is zero.\n\nThe task is, given m, find all n where Z(n) = m. Then count how many such n exist and list them.\n\nWait, but how do I find the possible n values? Because for a given m, there might be a range of n's that all give exactly m trailing zeros. For example, in the sample input, m=5, the n's are 5,6,7,8,9. So for each increment of n beyond a multiple of 5, the trailing zeros increase by 1, but sometimes when n crosses into a higher power of 5, like 25, it adds more.\n\nSo the approach is probably to find the lower and upper bounds of n that yield exactly m trailing zeros. But how?\n\nI think the key is to find the smallest n such that Z(n) = m, and then see how far you can go before Z(n) exceeds m.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's think differently. For each n, Z(n) increases as n increases. But sometimes it jumps by more than one. Like when n reaches a multiple of 25, Z(n) increases by 2: one from the 25, and another if it's a multiple of 5 again. Wait no, 25 contributes two 5s, so Z(n) increases by 2 when n goes from 24 to 25.\n\nBut for our problem, we need to find all n where Z(n) equals m. So perhaps for some m, there's a single n, or a range of n's.\n\nLet me think about how Z(n) behaves. It's a non-decreasing function. Once Z(n) reaches m, the next n's will have Z(n) equal to m until the next multiple of 5, which may cause it to jump.\n\nSo for example, between 5 and 9, Z(n) is 3 (for 5,6,7,8,9). Wait no, let me calculate:\n\nWait 5! is 120 → 1 zero.\n6! is 720 → 2.\n7! is 5040 → 2.\nWait, wait no: Wait 5! has one zero, 6! has one, no, wait 6 is 6*5, so 6! has 1+1=2 zeros? Or wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no. Let's compute Z(n) for small n:\n\nn | Z(n)\n1 | 0\n2 | 0\n3 | 0\n4 | 0\n5 | 1 (5/5=1)\n6 | 1 (6/5=1, 6/25=0, total 1)\n7 | 1\n8 | 1\n9 | 1\n10 | 2 (10/5=2)\n11 | 2\n12 | 2\n13 | 2\n14 | 2\n15 | 3 (15/5=3, 15/25=0)\n16 | 3\n... and so on.\n\nSo for m=1, n can be 5,6,7,8,9. That's 5 numbers.\n\nFor m=2, n starts at 10 and ends at 14, giving 5 numbers again.\n\nSo the idea is that for each m, there's a starting point and an ending point, and the count is the difference plus one.\n\nSo the plan is to find the minimal n where Z(n) >= m, but then check whether Z(n) is exactly m, and see how far the same m continues.\n\nBut how to find these n's efficiently.\n\nHmm, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Find the smallest n_low where Z(n_low) = m.\n\n2. Then find the largest n_high where Z(n_high) = m.\n\n3. The count is n_high - n_low + 1.\n\nSo the main challenge is to find n_low and n_high correctly.\n\nTo find n_low, we can perform a binary search for the minimal n where Z(n) >= m, but also ensure that Z(n_low) is exactly m.\n\nWait, but wait: because sometimes, when you reach a multiple of 5, the Z(n) can jump by more than 1. So for example, when n increases from 24 to 25, Z(n) increases by 2 (from 4 to 6). So for m=5, the n_low is 25, but wait no—because Z(24) is 4, Z(25) is 6. So for m=5, there's no n where Z(n)=5. So the output would be 0.\n\nWait, no, wait the first sample input was m=5, and the output was 5 6 7 8 9. How?\n\nBecause Z(5) is 1, Z(6)=1, Z(7)=1, Z(8)=1, Z(9)=1. Then Z(10)=2. So wait, why does m=5 not have any n's? Because m=5 is larger than the maximum Z(n) for n=9, which is 1. So for m=5, the output is 0.\n\nWait no, in the sample input, the user provided ['1', '5'] as input, but in the output, the second part is 0. So for m=5, there are no n's with Z(n)=5. So the output is 0.\n\nSo the first step is to find the minimal n where Z(n) >= m, but then verify whether Z(n) is exactly m. If it's more, then no solution exists.\n\nWait, no. Because for some m, there could be a range of n's where Z(n) remains m.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Use binary search to find the lower bound of n where Z(n) == m.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative approach: Since Z(n) is a non-decreasing function, for a given m, the possible n's form a contiguous range. So once we find the smallest n where Z(n) = m, and then find the largest n where Z(n) = m, the count is the difference plus one.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Find the smallest n_low where Z(n_low) = m.\n\n2. Find the largest n_high where Z(n_high) = m.\n\n3. The count is n_high - n_low + 1.\n\n4. If no such n exists (i.e., the minimal n where Z(n) >= m has Z(n) > m), then output 0.\n\nSo the key is to implement a way to compute Z(n) quickly.\n\nSo, I'll write a helper function to compute the number of trailing zeros for a given n.\n\nOnce that's done, I can perform binary search to find the lower and upper bounds.\n\nSo, first, implement the helper function:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, for finding n_low and n_high.\n\nWe can use binary search for n_low.\n\nThe initial lower bound is 0, upper bound is some high value. What's a suitable high value? Well, for m up to 1e5, what's the maximum possible n? Well, the maximum n for a given m can be found by solving Z(n) = m. For m=1e5, n is roughly around 5 * 1e5, but perhaps higher.\n\nAlternatively, for binary search, the upper bound can be set to 5*(m+1), which should be sufficient because each 5 contributes at least one zero.\n\nWait, let's think: for m=1e5, the minimal n is about 5e5, but perhaps 5*(m) is enough.\n\nSo for binary search, I can set low=0, high=5*m.\n\nWait, but for m=0, but in this problem m is at least 1, so that's fine.\n\nSo, for the lower bound, we can perform binary search to find the minimal n where Z(n) >= m. But then we need to check if Z(n) is exactly m.\n\nWait, no. Because for a given m, there might be no n where Z(n) = m. So after finding the minimal n where Z(n) >= m, we need to check whether Z(n) is m. If it's not, then there's no solution.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to find the minimal n where Z(n) == m, but that's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, here's the approach:\n\nUse binary search to find the first n where Z(n) >= m. Let's call this candidate_n.\n\nIf Z(candidate_n) != m, then no solution exists, output 0.\n\nOtherwise, we need to find the maximal n where Z(n) = m.\n\nHow to find that?\n\nWell, perhaps we can find the next n where Z(n) > m, and then subtract one.\n\nSo, let's find the minimal n where Z(n) > m. Then the maximal n where Z(n) = m is (n-1).\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Find the minimal n_low where Z(n_low) == m.\n\n2. Find the minimal n_high where Z(n_high) > m.\n\n3. Then, n_high - 1 is the maximal n where Z(n) = m.\n\nSo the count is n_high - n_low.\n\nWait, but how to find n_high?\n\nWe can perform another binary search for the minimal n where Z(n) > m.\n\nSo, for the first binary search, find the minimal n where Z(n) >= m. Let's call it low_candidate.\n\nIf Z(low_candidate) != m, return 0.\n\nElse, find the minimal n where Z(n) > m. Let's call it high_candidate.\n\nThen, n_high is high_candidate -1.\n\nThus, the count is high_candidate - low_candidate.\n\nWait, no. Because between low_candidate and high_candidate -1, all Z(n) is m.\n\nSo the numbers are [low_candidate, high_candidate-1], inclusive.\n\nThe count is (high_candidate -1) - low_candidate + 1 = high_candidate - low_candidate.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Binary search for the smallest n where Z(n) >= m. Let's call it candidate.\n\n- Check if Z(candidate) == m. If not, return 0.\n\n- Else, binary search for the smallest n where Z(n) > m. Let's call it high_candidate.\n\n- Then, the range is from candidate to high_candidate -1. So the count is (high_candidate -1) - candidate + 1 = high_candidate - candidate.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nImplement a binary search function that returns the minimal n where Z(n) >= target.\n\nSo, for the first step:\n\nlow = 0\n\nhigh = 5 * m (since for m=1, 5 is the candidate, and 5*m is 5 for m=1)\n\ncandidate = find_min_n_with_z_ge_m(m)\n\nif count_zeros(candidate) != m → output 0.\n\nelse:\n\nfind the next candidate where z > m.\n\nhigh_candidate = find_min_n_with_z_gt(m)\n\nthen the range is [candidate, high_candidate -1]\n\nso the count is high_candidate - candidate.\n\nSo, now, how to implement find_min_n_with_z_ge_m(m):\n\ndef find_min_n_ge(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target  # initial guess, but may need to be higher\n    res = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n        if z >= target:\n            res = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return res\n\nSimilarly, for find_min_n_gt(m):\n\ndef find_min_n_gt(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * (target + 1)\n    res = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n        if z > target:\n            res = mid\n            high = mid -1\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return res\n\nWait, but for the find_min_n_gt function, what if the target is m, and we're trying to find the first n where Z(n) > m. So, for example, if m=5, the function will look for the first n where Z(n) >5.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, m=5, the function will find that the minimal n where Z(n) >5 is 25. Because Z(25) is 6. So high_candidate is 25. So the range is 25-1=24. But wait, earlier I thought that for m=5, there are no n's because Z(n) never equals 5. So the first step would find candidate as 25, but Z(25) is 6, which is greater than 5. So the code would detect that and output 0.\n\nSo the steps are correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute candidate = find_min_n_ge(m)\n\nif candidate is -1 or count_zeros(candidate) != m → output 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute high_candidate = find_min_n_gt(m)\n\nthen the numbers are from candidate to high_candidate -1.\n\nSo the count is high_candidate - candidate.\n\nIf the count is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, output the list.\n\nBut wait, for the case where candidate is the only n that gives m trailing zeros. For example, if m=6, and candidate is 25, but high_candidate is 30 (Z(30) is 10?), but wait, let's compute.\n\nWait, Z(25) is 6 (25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6).\n\nZ(26) is 6, ..., Z(29) is 6.\n\nZ(30) is 30/5=6, 30/25=1, 30/125=0. So total 7.\n\nSo for m=6, high_candidate is 30. So the range is 25 to 29, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=1.\n\ncandidate is 5. Z(5) is 1.\n\nhigh_candidate is 10 (since Z(10) is 2, which is >1).\n\nSo the range is 5 to 9. 5 numbers.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: m=3.\n\nWhat's the Z(n) for various n:\n\nn=15: 15/5=3, 15/25=0 → Z=3.\n\nn=16: same.\n\n...\n\nn=19: same.\n\nn=20: 20/5=4, 20/25=0 → Z=4.\n\nSo for m=3, the high_candidate is 20.\n\nSo the range is 15 to 19, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code would output 5 numbers.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nIn Python, read m as integer.\n\nThen, perform the binary search.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list ['1', '5'], which suggests that the program must handle multiple test cases. Or perhaps it's a typo, and the actual input is a single line with m.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is a single line containing m. So in the sample, the input is '1' and '5' as separate lines? Or perhaps the sample is a misrepresentation.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the input is a single integer.\n\nBut in the sample, the input is given as ['1', '5'], implying two test cases. That's probably a mistake in the problem statement. So in reality, the input is a single m.\n\nWait, no, in the sample input, the output is two lines, but perhaps the input is one line with '1' and '5' as separate inputs. Or perhaps the problem expects to process multiple m's.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a single line.\n\nSo I think the sample input is a mistake, and in reality, the input is a single m.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects that for each line, we process one m.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo, in code, the input is read as a single integer.\n\nSo, the code can read m from stdin, possibly via input().strip()\n\nSo, moving on.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute candidate.\n\nCheck if Z(candidate) is m.\n\nIf not, output 0.\n\nElse, compute high_candidate.\n\nThen, the list is from candidate to high_candidate-1.\n\nIf the count is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, output the count and the list.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n_ge(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    res = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n        if z >= target:\n            res = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return res\n\ndef find_min_n_gt(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * (target + 1)\n    res = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n        if z > target:\n            res = mid\n            high = mid -1\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return res\n\nm = int(input())\n\ncandidate = find_min_n_ge(m)\n\nif candidate == -1 or count_zeros(candidate) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    high_candidate = find_min_n_gt(m)\n    # Now, the range is [candidate, high_candidate -1]\n    # The count is high_candidate - candidate\n    # So, the list is from candidate to high_candidate -1, inclusive\n    k = high_candidate - candidate\n    print(k)\n    if k >0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(candidate, high_candidate))))\n\nWait, but in Python, range is exclusive of the end, so range(a, b) includes a, a+1, ..., b-1.\n\nYes, so for a=candidate, b=high_candidate, the range is a to b-1.\n\nSo, the code above is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input: m=5.\n\nfind_min_n_ge(5):\n\nWe're looking for the smallest n where Z(n)>=5.\n\nLet's compute Z(20): 20/5=4, 20/25=0 → Z=4.\n\nZ(21): 4.\n\n...\n\nZ(24):4.\n\nZ(25):5/5=5, 25/25=1 → 6.\n\nWait, so Z(25) is 6, which is >=5.\n\nBut in the sample, m=5, but Z(25) is 6>5.\n\nSo candidate is 25.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6 !=5 → so output is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: m=1.\n\ncandidate is 5.\n\ncount_zeros(5)=1.\n\nThen, find_min_n_gt(1) is 10.\n\nSo the range is 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers.\n\nOutput is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\ncandidate is 25 (Z(25)=6).\n\nhigh_candidate is 30 (since Z(30) is 7).\n\nSo the range is 25-29: 5 numbers.\n\nSo the output is 5 followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: m=0.\n\nBut according to the problem, m is at least 1, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat if m=0?\n\nBut the constraints say m ≥1.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nWhat if m is very large, like 1e5.\n\nWe need to make sure the code can handle it.\n\nBut the binary search approach should be efficient enough.\n\nTime complexity of the binary search is O(log(5e5)) per search, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the code is as written above.\n\nNow, testing for m=2:\n\nfind_min_n_ge(2):\n\nLooking for the smallest n where Z(n)>=2.\n\nZ(5) is 1 <2.\n\nZ(6) is 1<2.\n\n...\n\nZ(10) is 2.\n\nSo candidate is 10.\n\ncount_zeros(10) is 2 == m.\n\nThen, find_min_n_gt(2):\n\nLooking for the smallest n where Z(n)>2.\n\nZ(10)=2.\n\nZ(11)=2.\n\n...\n\nZ(14)=2.\n\nZ(15)=3>2.\n\nSo high_candidate is 15.\n\nSo the range is 10 to 14: 5 numbers.\n\nSo output is 5 10 11 12 13 14.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Additionally, we need to list all such integers in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence from 1 to \\( n \\). Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   where the summation continues until \\( n \\) divided by \\( 5^k \\) is zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To efficiently find the range of \\( n \\) values that produce exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros:\n   - Use binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) (let's call it `candidate`) where \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\).\n   - Check if \\( Z(candidate) \\) is exactly \\( m \\).

If no valid \\( n \\) exists, output 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n_ge(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    res = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n        if z >= target:\n            res = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return res\n\ndef find_min_n_gt(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * (target + 1)\n    res = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n        if z > target:\n            res = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return res\n\nm = int(input())\n\ncandidate = find_min_n_ge(m)\n\nif candidate == -1 or count_zeros(candidate) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    high_candidate = find_min_n_gt(m)\n    k = high_candidate - candidate\n    print(k)\n    if k > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(candidate, high_candidate))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **count_zeros Function**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) using the formula described.\n- **Binary Search Functions**: `find_min_n_ge` finds the smallest \\( n \\) where the number of trailing zeros is at least \\( m \\). `find_min_n_gt` finds the smallest \\( n \\) where the number of trailing zeros exceeds \\( m \\).\n- **Main Logic**: Read the input \\( m \\), use binary searches to determine the valid range of \\( n \\) values, and print the results accordingly.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, ensuring that the solution is both optimal and handles all edge cases correctly.",
