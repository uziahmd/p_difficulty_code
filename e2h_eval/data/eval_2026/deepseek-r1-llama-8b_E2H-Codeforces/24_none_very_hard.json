She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

It then calls the `solve` function for each line and prints the result to standard output.\n\nThe `solve` function takes four parameters: `n`, the total number of tabs; `pos`, the current position of the cursor; `l`, the left boundary of the segment to keep open; and `r`, the right boundary of the segment to keep open. It returns the minimum number of seconds required to close all tabs outside the segment `[l, r]`.\n\nThe function first checks if the segment `[l, r]` intersects with the current position of the cursor. If it does not, it simply returns the number of tabs outside the segment.\n\nIf the segment intersects with the cursor, it checks if the left or right boundary of the segment is closer to the cursor. If the left boundary is closer, it returns the minimum of the distance between the cursor and the left boundary, and the distance between the cursor and the right boundary, plus one (to account for the operation of closing all tabs to the left of the cursor). Otherwise, it returns one (to account for the operation of closing all tabs to the right of the cursor).\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(1), making it efficient for large inputs.",
