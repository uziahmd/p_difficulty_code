In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles, and she needs to draw the minimum number of extra tiles to form at least one mentsu. A mentsu can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). \n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly is required. The input gives me three tiles, each represented as a string like '1m', '9s', etc. I need to find for each possible starting state the minimal number of tiles she needs to add so that among all her tiles (original plus added), there's at least one mentsu.\n\nSo, my plan is to consider all possible ways she can form a mentsu by adding 0, 1, 2, or maybe more tiles. But since she starts with three, adding four would make seven, which seems unlikely, but perhaps in some cases necessary. However, I think the maximum needed would be two additions because after that, any further draws would only make it easier, but perhaps not. Wait, no. Let's see: if she already has a triplet, then she can stop. So, the minimal number is likely 0, 1, or 2.\n\nWait, let's think about the example given. In the third case, she had 3p, 9m, 2p. She needs to add one tile to form a sequence. So adding 1 was sufficient.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each possible mentsu (all possible triplets and sequences), check if after adding some tiles, she can have that mentsu. Then, find the minimal number of tiles needed across all possibilities.\n\nBut considering all possibilities might be computationally expensive. So I need an efficient way to model this.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. For the given initial three tiles, generate all possible subsets that could form a mentsu when combined with additional tiles.\n\n2. For each possible mentsu type (triplet or sequence), check how many tiles are missing from the initial set, and compute the required number of additions.\n\n3. Keep track of the minimal number required across all possible mentsus.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the better approach is to consider all possible possible mentsus that can be formed by adding up to two tiles, and see which is the earliest possible.\n\nWait, but how? Because the mentsu must consist of exactly three tiles, but when you add tiles, you can have more than three. But the mentsu just requires at least three tiles forming a valid triplet or sequence.\n\nWait, no. The problem says she must have at least one mentsu in her hand. So her total tiles, after adding, must include a subset of three that form a mentsu.\n\nSo, for example, if she has four tiles, including three that form a triplet, that's fine.\n\nSo the key is to find the minimal number of tiles to add such that within the current tiles plus the added ones, there exists a triplet or a sequence.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps the approach is:\n\nFor the given initial tiles, check all possible ways to form a triplet or a sequence by adding 0, 1, 2, ... tiles, and find the minimal number required.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the process.\n\nFirst, group the initial tiles by suit. For each suit, count the occurrences of each number.\n\nFor example, for each suit m, p, s, we have a frequency dictionary.\n\nNow, for each possible triplet or sequence, calculate how many tiles are needed beyond the current ones.\n\nFor a triplet (koutsu):\n\nIt requires three identical tiles. So for a specific number and suit, if the current count is less than 3, the number of tiles needed is 3 - current count.\n\nFor a sequence (shuntsu):\n\nIt requires three consecutive numbers in the same suit. For each possible starting number in each suit, check if the current tiles have the required numbers. The number of missing tiles will determine how many to add.\n\nAdditionally, since she can add any tiles, including duplicates, perhaps she can complete the sequence by adding the missing tiles.\n\nSo, for each possible triplet and sequence, compute the minimal number of tiles to add to get that mentsu, then pick the minimal across all possibilities.\n\nBut the problem is that some triplets or sequences may require adding multiple tiles, but the overall minimal is the smallest across all possibilities.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- For each possible mentsu (triplet or sequence), compute how many tiles she needs to add to have at least that mentsu.\n\nThen, the minimal such number across all possible mentsus is the answer.\n\nNow, how to represent the initial tiles.\n\nI'll parse the input into a dictionary, where the key is the suit (m, p, s), and the value is another dictionary mapping numbers to their counts.\n\nLike:\n\ntiles = {\n    'm': { '1': 1, '2': 2 },\n    'p': { '3': 1 },\n    's': { '5': 1 }\n}\n\nWait, perhaps using a dictionary of dictionaries.\n\nOnce that's done, for each possible triplet and sequence, calculate the required tiles.\n\nLet me think about how to generate all possible triplets and sequences.\n\nTriplets are straightforward: for each suit, and for each number (1-9), the triplet is (number, number, number).\n\nSo for each number in 1-9, for each suit, a triplet is possible.\n\nThen, for a given triplet, the required tiles are 3 minus the count in the initial tiles.\n\nFor example, if the initial tiles have two copies of 2m, then adding one more 2m would complete the triplet, requiring 1 addition.\n\nFor a sequence, it's a bit more complex. For each suit, for each possible starting number (1-7, since a sequence can start at 1 and go up to 7, making 1,2,3; 2,3,4; up to 7,8,9), we have a sequence.\n\nFor each such sequence, we need to see how many of the three numbers are present in the initial tiles.\n\nEach number in the sequence contributes to the count. For example, if the initial tiles have 2m, 3m, then the sequence 1,2,3m requires adding 1m. The number of tiles needed is max(3 - count, 0) for each number, but wait, no: for the sequence [a, a+1, a+2], we need at least one of each. So for each number in the sequence, if the current count is zero, then one tile is needed. If it's one, nothing else is needed except the other two. Or wait, no: for each number in the sequence, if the initial count is >=1, then that's sufficient for that part. Otherwise, we need to add it.\n\nSo for a sequence, the number of tiles needed is the sum over each number in the sequence of max(1 - count, 0). Because for each number in the sequence, if the initial count is zero, you need to add one. Else, you don't need to add anything for that number.\n\nWait, no. Because even if the initial count is more than one, you still have at least one in your hand. So for the sequence, you need at least one of each number. So the required number of tiles to add is the number of numbers in the sequence that are not present in the initial tiles.\n\nSo for example, if the initial tiles have 2m, 3m, then the sequence 1,2,3m requires adding 1m (so 1 tile). The sequence 2,3,4m requires adding 4m (1 tile). The sequence 3,4,5m requires adding 3,4,5? Wait no: no, because for the sequence 3,4,5m, the initial has 3m, so you need to add 4m and 5m. That would require 2 tiles. So the number of tiles needed is the count of numbers in the sequence not present in the initial tiles.\n\nWait, no: for the sequence 3,4,5m, initial has 3m. So 4m and 5m are missing. So two tiles are needed.\n\nSo for a sequence, the required tiles are the count of numbers in the sequence that are not present in the initial tiles.\n\nThus, for each sequence, compute this count.\n\nSo, for each possible triplet and sequence, compute the required number of tiles to add, and then select the minimal one.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read the initial three tiles.\n\n2. For each suit, create a frequency dictionary.\n\n3. Enumerate all possible triplets and sequences.\n\n4. For each triplet, compute the required tiles to add.\n\n5. For each sequence, compute the required tiles to add.\n\n6. Find the minimal required across all triplets and sequences.\n\n7. Output the minimal required.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where adding more than one tile allows for multiple mentsus? For example, adding two tiles could allow for both a triplet and a sequence, but the minimal is 1.\n\nBut since we're looking for the minimal, it's sufficient to find the smallest required across all possibilities.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, read the input.\n\nThe input is a single line with three strings. So, for example, the input could be something like \"1m 2m 3m\" or \"9m 9m 9m\".\n\nWe can split the input into a list of three strings.\n\nThen, for each of the three, extract the suit and the number. Then, build a dictionary per suit, counting the occurrences.\n\nSo, for each tile in the input:\n\nsuit = tile[1]\n\nnumber = tile[0]\n\nWe can represent this as a dictionary like:\n\ntiles = {'m': defaultdict(int), 'p': defaultdict(int), 's': defaultdict(int)}\n\nThen, for each tile in the input, increment the count for that suit and number.\n\nOnce this structure is built, for each possible triplet and sequence, compute the required tiles.\n\nNow, let's think about how to generate all possible triplets and sequences.\n\nFor triplets:\n\nLoop through each suit (m, p, s).\n\nFor each suit, loop through each number from 1 to 9.\n\nSo for each (suit, num), the triplet is (num, num, num).\n\nFor this triplet, the required tiles to add is 3 - count_in_initial.\n\nBut, if the count is already 3, then required is 0.\n\nFor sequences:\n\nLoop through each suit (m, p, s).\n\nFor each suit, loop through each possible starting number from 1 to 7 (since 7 is the last possible starting number to form a sequence of three numbers).\n\nSo for each starting number a, the sequence is [a, a+1, a+2].\n\nFor this sequence, for each number in [a, a+1, a+2], check if it's present in the initial tiles for this suit.\n\nThe required tiles are the count of numbers in the sequence that are not present.\n\nSo for each sequence, the required is the number of missing numbers.\n\nNow, after generating all possible triplets and sequences, compute the required tiles for each, and keep the minimal value.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where a triplet is part of a sequence? Like, suppose a triplet is 3m,3m,3m. Then, the sequence 2m,3m,4m is also present. So adding tiles could complete both, but the minimal required is based on the triplet alone.\n\nBut since we're considering all possibilities, the triplet's required tiles would be considered, and if that's lower, it's taken.\n\nSo the code can proceed by considering all possible triplets and sequences, compute their required, and take the minimal.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nSo, the initial tiles are:\n\n1s, 2s, 3s → this forms a shuntsu, so no tiles needed. So the first case requires 0.\n\nThe second case is 9m x3 → a triplet, so 0 needed.\n\nThe third case is 3p,9m,2p → looking for minimal adds.\n\nPossible options:\n\nLooking for triplet: for example, 2p x3 → currently 1, so need 2 more → 2 adds.\n\nOr for 3p,9m,2p: can't form a triplet.\n\nFor sequences:\n\nIn suit p, what sequences can be formed.\n\nLooking for 2p,3p,4p: current has 2p and 3p, so need 4p → 1 add.\n\nOr 3p,4p,5p: current has 3p, need 4p and 5p → 2 adds.\n\nSo the minimal is 1.\n\nThus, the output is ['0','0','1'].\n\nSo the code should correctly find these.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, the code structure:\n\nRead the input line, split into three strings.\n\nFor each string, extract the suit and number.\n\nBuild a dictionary for each suit, mapping numbers to their counts.\n\nNow, for each possible triplet:\n\nFor each suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n   for num in 1..9:\n\n       count = tiles[suit].get(num, 0)\n\n       required = max(3 - count, 0)\n\n       add this required to the list of candidates.\n\nThen, for each possible sequence:\n\nFor each suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n   for a in 1..7:\n\n       numbers = [a, a+1, a+2]\n\n       required = 0\n\n       for n in numbers:\n\n           if tiles[suit].get(n, 0) == 0:\n\n               required += 1\n\n       add required to the list of candidates.\n\nAfter collecting all candidates, the minimal is the answer.\n\nWait, but what about sequences that wrap around, like 9,1,2? No, because the definition says that a sequence is three sequential numbers in the same suit. So 9,1,2 is not a sequence because 9 is followed by 1, which is not +1. So the sequences are strictly increasing.\n\nThus, our approach is correct.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nWe can represent the initial tiles as a dictionary:\n\ntiles = {'m': defaultdict(int), 'p': defaultdict(int), 's': defaultdict(int)}\n\nThen, for each of the three input strings:\n\ntile_str = input().split()[i]\n\nsuit = tile_str[1]\n\nnum = tile_str[0]\n\ntiles[suit][num] += 1\n\nOnce this is built, proceed to generate all possible triplets and sequences.\n\nCompute the required for each triplet and sequence.\n\nThen, collect all required values, and find the minimal.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python:\n\nRead the input:\n\ntiles_input = input().split()\n\ntiles = {'m': defaultdict(int), 'p': defaultdict(int), 's': defaultdict(int)}\n\nfor t in tiles_input:\n    suit = t[1]\n    num = t[0]\n    tiles[suit][num] += 1\n\nThen, collect all possible required.\n\ncandidates = []\n\n# Check all triplets\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for num in range(1, 10):\n        count = tiles[suit].get(str(num), 0)\n        required = max(3 - count, 0)\n        candidates.append(required)\n\n# Check all sequences\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n    for a in range(1, 8):  # a can be 1 to 7 inclusive\n        # The sequence is a, a+1, a+2\n        required = 0\n        for n in [str(a), str(a+1), str(a+2)]:\n            if tiles[suit].get(n, 0) == 0:\n                required += 1\n        candidates.append(required)\n\n# Now find the minimal candidate\nmin_required = min(candidates)\n\nprint(min_required)\n\nWait, but wait: the output is supposed to be three integers, each corresponding to the minimal required for each of the three input groups.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Oh no! I think I misunderstood the problem.\n\nThe problem statement says that the input is three strings, each representing a tile. Each of them is a suited tile. So the initial hand is three tiles.\n\nThe output is three integers, each being the minimal required draws for each of the three input tiles' groups.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nAh! No, the output is a single integer. Wait, looking back:\n\nProblem statement says:\n\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\nWait, no. The sample input shows that the output is a list of three integers. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nOutput:\n\n['0', '0', '1']\n\nSo, the output is a list of three integers, each being the minimal required for each of the three input groups.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with what I thought earlier. So, I think I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, no, wait. Looking at the problem statement again:\n\nThe input is three tiles, and the output is three numbers.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense. Because the problem is to find the minimal number of tiles she needs to draw regardless of which mentsu she forms. So why is the output three numbers?\n\nWait, the sample output is ['0', '0', '1'], which suggests that for each of the three input tiles, the minimal required is 0, 0, and 1 respectively.\n\nWait, that's probably not the case. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that for each of the three tiles, we need to find the minimal number of draws required to form a mentsu that includes that tile.\n\nNo, that makes more sense. So, for each tile in the input, compute the minimal number of tiles to add so that this particular tile is part of a mentsu.\n\nBut that's a different problem.\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe output is three integers. The note says:\n\n\"In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\"\n\nSo, the output is three numbers, each for each of the three input tiles.\n\nWait, but that seems odd because the minimal required for the entire hand is the same as the minimal for any individual tile.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nNo, the problem is that the three input tiles are separate, and for each of them, compute the minimal number of tiles needed to be drawn so that that specific tile is part of a mentsu.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says: she must have at least one mentsu in her hand. So, it's about the entire hand, not individual tiles.\n\nSo the sample output is three numbers, each being the minimal required for each of the three input groups.\n\nWait, but that doesn't fit with the sample explanation. Because in the third case, she draws one tile, and that tile is either 1p or 4p, which are part of a shuntsu that includes 2p and 3p.\n\nSo, for the third input tile (3p 9m 2p), the minimal is 1. For the others, 0.\n\nSo the output is three numbers: for each of the three input tiles, compute the minimal number of tiles to add so that that specific tile is part of a mentsu.\n\nWait, but that's a different problem.\n\nSo, the problem is to find, for each of the three input tiles, the minimal number of tiles she needs to add so that this tile is part of a mentsu.\n\nSo, for each tile T in the input, compute the minimal number of tiles to add such that T is part of a mentsu in the entire collection (after adding those tiles).\n\nSo, the output is three numbers, one for each input tile.\n\nThis changes the approach.\n\nHmm, now I need to think differently.\n\nSo, for each of the three input tiles, I need to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that that tile is part of at least one mentsu.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nFor each tile T in the input:\n\n- Determine all possible mentsus that include T.\n\n- For each such mentsu, compute how many tiles are needed to complete it beyond the current tiles.\n\n- Take the minimal such number.\n\nSo, for each tile, it's part of several possible mentsus. We need to find the minimal required to complete any of those mentsus.\n\nThus, for each tile T, the minimal required is the minimal over all possible mentsus that include T.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each tile T in the input:\n\n1. Generate all possible mentsus that include T.\n\n2. For each such mentsu, compute the number of tiles needed to add to have at least that mentsu.\n\n3. Among all these, find the minimal required.\n\nThus, the output is three numbers, each for each input tile.\n\nSo, the sample input:\n\nTile 1: 1s.\n\nIt is part of the shuntsu 1s, 2s, 3s. Since this already exists, the minimal required is 0.\n\nTile 2: 9m.\n\nIt is part of the koutsu 9m x3. This already exists, so minimal is 0.\n\nTile 3: 3p.\n\nIt can be part of the shuntsu 2p,3p,4p. Currently, 3p is present, 2p is present. So adding 4p is needed. So minimal is 1.\n\nThus, the output is [0,0,1].\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each tile T in the input:\n\n- Enumerate all possible mentsus that include T.\n\n- For each such mentsu, compute how many tiles are needed to add, so that the mentsu is completed.\n\n- Take the minimal required.\n\nThus, the code must process each of the three tiles, for each, find the minimal required.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, for each tile T, which is a string like '1s':\n\nWe need to find all possible mentsus that include T.\n\nA mentsu is either a triplet (three same tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive in the same suit).\n\nSo, for a given T, it can be part of multiple mentsus.\n\nFor example, T is '2m'.\n\nIt can be part of the triplet 2m,2m,2m.\n\nIt can be part of sequences like 1m,2m,3m; 2m,3m,4m.\n\nIt can also be part of a triplet in the same suit, same number.\n\nSo, for each tile T, we need to generate all possible mentsus that include T, then for each, compute the required tiles.\n\nBut considering all possible mentsus is computationally intensive, but manageable since the numbers are small.\n\nSo, for each tile T:\n\n- Extract its suit and number.\n\nSuit S = T[1]\n\nNumber N = T[0]\n\nNow, consider all possible mentsus that include T.\n\nCase 1: Triplet.\n\nThe triplet is (N, S, 3 times).\n\nSo, for this triplet, T is part of it.\n\nThe required tiles to add are 3 - count of N in S.\n\nBut, count is the initial count plus any tiles added for this triplet.\n\nWait, no: for the triplet, the current count is the initial count for N in S.\n\nSo, required is 3 - (initial count of N in S).\n\nCase 2: Sequences.\n\nFor sequences, T can be part of multiple sequences.\n\nEach sequence is a triplet of consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\nSo, for each possible sequence that includes N, check how many of the three numbers in the sequence are already present.\n\nThe required is the number of missing numbers.\n\nBut since T is part of the sequence, at least one is present.\n\nSo, for each possible sequence that includes T:\n\nCompute the required as the number of other numbers in the sequence that are not present.\n\nWait, but the sequence is three numbers, and T is one of them. So, for each such sequence, the required is the count of numbers in the sequence (excluding T) that are not present in the initial tiles.\n\nBecause adding those would complete the sequence.\n\nSo, for each sequence that includes T, the required is the count of the other two numbers not present.\n\nWait, no. Because for the sequence a, a+1, a+2, if T is a, then the sequence requires a+1 and a+2.\n\nSo, for each such sequence, the required is the count of the other two numbers not present.\n\nSo, for a given T, which is a part of a sequence, the required is the number of other two numbers in the sequence that are missing.\n\nSo, to find all possible sequences that include T:\n\nLoop through each possible starting point a where a <= N <= a+2.\n\nSo, a can be N-2, N-1, N.\n\nBut wait, the sequence is three consecutive numbers. So for a given N, the possible sequences that include it are:\n\nIf N >=1 and N <=7:\n\nthe sequences starting at N-2: a = N-2 → covers N-2, N-1, N.\n\nWait, no: a can be from 1 to 7, so for each a, the sequence is a, a+1, a+2.\n\nSo, for a given N, the sequences that include N are those where a <= N <= a+2.\n\nWhich implies a can be from N-2 to N, but ensuring that a >=1 and a+2 <=9.\n\nWait, let me think:\n\nFor a given N, the possible a's are:\n\na can be N-2, N-1, or N, provided that a >=1 and a+2 <=9.\n\nSo:\n\nif N >= 3 → a can be N-2.\n\nif N >=2 → a can be N-1.\n\na can always be N, provided that a+2 <=9.\n\nSo, for N=1:\n\na can be 1 → sequence 1,2,3.\n\nFor N=2:\n\na can be 0 (invalid), 1, 2.\n\nOnly a=1 and a=2 are valid.\n\nWait, a cannot be 0 because a starts from 1.\n\nSo for N=2:\n\na can be 1 (covers 1,2,3) and 2 (covers 2,3,4).\n\nSimilarly, for N=3:\n\na can be 1 (covers 1,2,3), 2 (covers 2,3,4), 3 (covers 3,4,5).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, for each N, the possible a's are:\n\nstart_a = max(1, N-2)\n\nend_a = min(7, N)\n\nSo, for each a in start_a to end_a:\n\nif a <=7:\n\n   the sequence is a, a+1, a+2.\n\nSo, for each such a, we can generate the sequence.\n\nThus, for each T, the possible sequences are the sequences where a is in [max(1, N-2), min(7, N)].\n\nSo, for each T, the steps are:\n\n1. Consider the triplet: the required is 3 - current count for N in S.\n\n2. For each possible sequence that includes T, compute the required as the count of the other two numbers in the sequence not present in the initial tiles.\n\n3. Take the minimal required between the triplet and all sequences.\n\nSo, for each T, the minimal required is the minimum between the triplet's required and the minimal required from any sequence.\n\nThus, the code needs to process each T in the input, and for each T, compute the minimal required.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nRead the three input tiles.\n\nFor each tile T in the input:\n\n   suit S = T[1]\n\n   num N = T[0]\n\n   count_N = initial count of N in S.\n\n   required_triplet = max(3 - count_N, 0)\n\n   min_required = required_triplet\n\n   # Now, check sequences\n\n   start_a = max(1, int(N)-2)\n\n   end_a = min(7, int(N))\n\n   for a in range(start_a, end_a + 1):\n\n       seq = [a, a+1, a+2]\n\n       required_seq = 0\n\n       for n in seq:\n\n           if n != int(N):  # since T is part of the sequence\n\n               if tiles[S].get(str(n), 0) == 0:\n\n                   required_seq += 1\n\n       if required_seq < min_required:\n\n           min_required = required_seq\n\n   print(min_required)\n\nWait, but wait: in the triplet case, the required is 3 - count_N. For example, if count_N is 2, then adding 1 more tile completes the triplet.\n\nIn the sequence case, the required is the number of other two numbers in the sequence not present.\n\nSo, for each sequence that includes T, we compute the required.\n\nBut wait, when N is part of a sequence, for each other number in the sequence, if it's not present, it's a required tile.\n\nSo, for the sequence a, a+1, a+2, if N is a, then the other numbers are a+1 and a+2.\n\nIf either is not present, they need to be added.\n\nThus, for each sequence that includes T, the required is the count of a+1 and a+2 (if applicable) that are missing.\n\nWait, but for a sequence like a, a+1, a+2, the required is the count of numbers in the sequence (other than T) that are missing.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for each sequence a, a+1, a+2:\n\n   required = 0\n\n   for n in [a+1, a+2] if n != N:\n\n       if tiles[S].get(str(n), 0) == 0:\n\n           required +=1\n\n   compare with current min_required.\n\nThus, the code for each tile T is:\n\nCompute the triplet required.\n\nCompute all possible sequences that include T, and for each, compute required.\n\nTake the minimal.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nFor each T:\n\n1. T is '1s'\n\nS = 's', N = 1.\n\ncount_N = 1 (since initial has 1s, 2s, 3s).\n\nrequired_triplet: 3-1=2.\n\nBut wait, the triplet for 1s is 1s x3. Initial has 1s once. So to make triplet, need 2 more.\n\nBut in the sample, the triplet isn't the best option. Because the sequence is already present.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the minimal is 0, as the sequence is already present.\n\nSo, for T='1s':\n\nCheck sequences.\n\na can be max(1, 1-2)=1, min(7,1) =1.\n\nSo, a=1.\n\nSequence is 1,2,3.\n\nOther numbers in sequence: 2 and 3.\n\nCheck if 2 and 3 are present.\n\nIn S, 2s and 3s are present.\n\nThus, required_seq is 0.\n\nThus, min_required is min(2, 0) = 0.\n\n2. T is '9m'.\n\nS='m', N=9.\n\ncount_N=3 (since input has 9m,9m,9m).\n\nrequired_triplet is 0.\n\nCheck sequences:\n\na can be max(1,9-2)=7, min(7,9)=7.\n\nSo a=7.\n\nSequence is 7,8,9.\n\nOther numbers: 8 and 9.\n\nCheck if 8m is present. It's not. So required_seq is 1.\n\nThus, min_required is 0.\n\n3. T is '3p'.\n\nS='p', N=3.\n\ncount_N=1 (initial has 3p,9m,2p).\n\nrequired_triplet: 3-1=2.\n\nCheck sequences.\n\na can be max(1,3-2)=1, min(7,3)=3.\n\nSo a can be 1, 2, 3.\n\nFor each a:\n\na=1: sequence 1,2,3.\n\nOther numbers: 2p and 3p.\n\nCheck:\n\n2p is present (initial has 2p?), yes.\n\nSo required_seq is 0.\n\nWait, initial for 'p' has 3p and 2p.\n\nSo for a=1, the sequence is 1,2,3.\n\nOther numbers are 2 and 3.\n\nBoth are present. So required_seq is 0.\n\nThus, min_required is 0.\n\nWait, but sample output is 1 for the third tile.\n\nWait, this suggests a problem in my approach.\n\nWait, in the third tile's case, the initial tiles are 3p,9m,2p.\n\nSo, for T=3p, what is the minimal required.\n\nThe triplet requires 2 adds.\n\nThe sequences:\n\nFor a=1: sequence 1p,2p,3p. Other numbers: 2p and 3p. Both are present, so required 0.\n\nThus, the minimal required is 0.\n\nBut the sample output for this tile is 1.\n\nWait, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, the sample output is ['0','0','1'].\n\nSo, in the third case, the minimal required is 1.\n\nBut according to my approach, it's 0.\n\nWhat's wrong here.\n\nAh! Because the sequence requires that all three numbers are present.\n\nWait, the sequence for a=1 is 1p,2p,3p.\n\nIn the initial tiles, 3p and 2p are present. But 1p is not.\n\nSo, to form this sequence, the required is 1 (add 1p).\n\nBut earlier I thought that the required is the count of the other two numbers besides T.\n\nWait, T is 3p, which is part of the sequence.\n\nSo, for a=1, the other numbers are 2p and 1p.\n\nIn the initial, 2p is present, 1p is not.\n\nThus, required is 1.\n\nAh! So my code is wrong in this aspect.\n\nSo, the mistake is in how I'm calculating the required for the sequences.\n\nEarlier, I thought that for a sequence a, a+1, a+2, the required is the count of the other two numbers (besides T) that are missing.\n\nBut T is part of the sequence, so for a sequence [a,a+1,a+2], if T is a, then the other two are a+1 and a+2.\n\nSo, for each sequence, required is the number of other two numbers (excluding T) that are missing.\n\nThus, for a=1, T=3p is not part of this sequence.\n\nWait, no. T=3p is part of the sequence a=1's sequence.\n\nWait, no: a=1's sequence is 1p, 2p, 3p.\n\nT is 3p, which is part of this sequence.\n\nThus, the other numbers are 1p and 2p.\n\nIn the initial, 2p is present, 1p is not.\n\nThus, required is 1.\n\nSo, for a=1, required is 1.\n\nThus, in the third tile's case, the minimal required is the minimum between the triplet (2) and the sequences.\n\nFor a=1: required 1.\n\nFor a=2: sequence is 2p,3p,4p.\n\nOther numbers: 3p and 4p.\n\n3p is present, 4p is not. So required is 1.\n\nFor a=3: sequence is 3p,4p,5p.\n\nOther numbers: 4p and 5p.\n\nNeither is present. So required is 2.\n\nThus, among the sequences, the minimal required is 1.\n\nThus, the minimal for T=3p is min(2, 1) =1.\n\nThus, the code must correctly compute the required for each sequence as the number of other two numbers (excluding T) that are missing.\n\nThus, the code for each sequence should be:\n\nFor a sequence a, a+1, a+2:\n\n   if T's number is N, then:\n\n      other_numbers = [a, a+1, a+2] without N.\n\n      count the number of other_numbers not present.\n\nThus, for a=1, N=3p:\n\n   other_numbers = 1p and 2p.\n\n   1p is not present, 2p is present.\n\n   So required is 1.\n\nThus, the code must correctly compute this.\n\nSo, the code for each sequence is:\n\nfor a in ...:\n\n   seq = [a, a+1, a+2]\n\n   other_numbers = [n for n in seq if n != N]\n\n   required = sum(1 for n in other_numbers if tiles[suit].get(str(n), 0) == 0)\n\nThus, in code:\n\nfor a in range(start_a, end_a +1):\n\n   seq = [a, a+1, a+2]\n\n   other_numbers = [str(x) for x in seq if str(x) != str(N)]\n\n   required_seq = 0\n\n   for n in other_numbers:\n\n       if tiles[suit].get(n, 0) == 0:\n\n           required_seq +=1\n\n   if required_seq < min_required:\n\n       min_required = required_seq\n\nThus, the code needs to",
