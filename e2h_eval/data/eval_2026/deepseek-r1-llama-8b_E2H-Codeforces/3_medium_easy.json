Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Vanya is walking along a street lit by lanterns, and I have to find the minimal radius d such that all points on the street are covered. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each lantern lights a segment of the street from (ai - d) to (ai + d), but considering the boundaries. So for each lantern, the coverage starts at max(0, ai -d) and ends at min(l, ai +d). The goal is to choose d as small as possible so that the union of all these segments covers the entire [0, l] interval.\n\nHmm, so how do I model this? Well, maybe I can think about the street as being divided into intervals covered by the lanterns, and find the gaps between them. The minimal d will be determined by the largest gap between consecutive lantern coverages.\n\nWait, but the lanterns might not be sorted. Oh right! So first, I should sort the positions of the lanterns. Because if they are in order, it's easier to process their coverage sequentially.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Read the input: n and l, then the list of ai's.\n2. Sort the ai's in increasing order.\n3. Compute the coverage for each lantern with some initial guess of d, then find the maximum gap between the end of one coverage and the start of the next.\n4. The minimal d is the smallest value such that when you compute all the coverage, there are no gaps.\n\nBut wait, how do I find d? It's not straightforward because the coverage depends on d. Maybe I can perform a binary search on d. Since d can vary, and the function (whether the street is fully covered) is monotonic in d, binary search would work.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the plan is:\n\n- Use binary search over possible d values. For each candidate d, check if all points on the street are covered by at least one lantern's coverage.\n- If yes, try a smaller d; if no, increase d.\n\nBut how do I efficiently compute whether a given d is sufficient?\n\nLet me outline the steps more concretely.\n\nFirst, sort the lanterns' positions. Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, determine the area between them that's not covered. The maximum such area across all pairs will dictate part of the required d. Also, we need to consider the ends: the first lantern's left coverage and the last lantern's right coverage.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: compute the coverage intervals for each lantern, merge overlapping ones, and see if the entire [0, l] is covered. But since d is variable, this isn't directly applicable. So perhaps during the binary search, for a given d, compute the union of all [max(0, ai-d), min(l, ai+d)] intervals and check if the union covers [0, l].\n\nYes, that's manageable.\n\nSo, the algorithm steps:\n\n1. Read the input, extract n, l, and the list of a_i.\n2. Sort the a_i in non-decreasing order.\n3. Perform binary search on d:\n   a. For each mid d in binary search, compute the coverage intervals.\n   b. Check if the union of these intervals covers [0, l].\n   c. Adjust the binary search bounds based on whether the coverage is complete.\n4. After finding the minimal d, output it with 10 decimal places.\n\nNow, let's think about the binary search range. The minimal possible d is zero, but that's only if all lanterns are at the same point. The maximal possible d is (l / 2), because with that, a single lantern in the middle can cover the entire street. So the binary search can run from low=0 to high=l/2.\n\nWait, but even that may not be necessary. For example, if the street is of length l, the farthest any lantern can be is either at 0 or l. So for two lanterns at 0 and l, the required d is max(l/2, ...). Hmm, maybe setting high to l is enough, but perhaps starting with a better initial range is better.\n\nAlternatively, during binary search, the initial low can be 0, and high can be the maximum of (a_i - 0) for all i, but wait, that's not correct. Wait, no. Think of the worst case: the first lantern is at 0, the next at l. Then the required d is l/2 to cover the entire street. So high can be set to l/2 initially. Or perhaps higher, but l is up to 1e9, which is manageable since binary search is logarithmic.\n\nBut for practicality, setting high to l is acceptable because binary search will handle it quickly.\n\nSo, the binary search steps:\n\nInitialize low = 0, high = l.\n\nWhile the difference between high and low is greater than a small epsilon (like 1e-11), do the following:\n\n- mid = (low + high) / 2\n- Compute the coverage for each lantern with this mid d.\n- Check if the union of these intervals covers [0, l].\n- If yes, set high = mid.\n- Else, set low = mid.\n\nOnce the loop ends, the minimal d is approximately high (or low, depending on convergence).\n\nNow, the key part is the function that checks if a given d is sufficient.\n\nHow to implement this function:\n\nFor a given d, each lantern i contributes an interval [start_i, end_i], where start_i = max(0, a_i - d), end_i = min(l, a_i + d).\n\nWe need to find if the union of all these intervals covers [0, l].\n\nOne way is to compute the merged intervals and check if the merged coverage includes 0 and l.\n\nWait, but that could be done by tracking the current coverage and seeing if it extends beyond each step.\n\nAlternatively, after sorting the a_i, we can process them in order, keeping track of the current end of coverage. For each lantern, we calculate its start and end. The start must be <= previous end + 1 (since we can have a gap), and the end must be >= previous end.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is:\n\nSort the a_i.\n\nInitialize prev_end = 0.\n\nFor each a in sorted_a:\n\n   current_start = max(0, a - d)\n   current_end = min(l, a + d)\n\n   if current_start > prev_end:\n       there is a gap between prev_end and current_start. So the entire coverage is not complete.\n\n   else:\n       update prev_end to max(prev_end, current_end)\n\nAfter processing all a's, check if prev_end >= l.\n\nIf any gap was found during processing, return False.\n\nElse, return True.\n\nYes, that seems efficient.\n\nBecause after sorting, we can process each lantern in O(n) time, which is acceptable for n up to 1000.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nImplement a binary search where each step evaluates the coverage.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: All lanterns are at the same point. Then d can be zero.\n\nWait, but the lantern's radius must be positive, or can it be zero? Looking back at the problem statement: \"d is some positive number.\" So d must be >0.\n\nWait, wait, the problem says \"d is some positive number, common for all lanterns.\" So d has to be strictly positive.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, for the second test case, both lanterns are at position 2 and 5. Then d=2 is the answer. So in that case, the first lantern covers [0,4], the second [3,5]. So the entire [0,5] is covered.\n\nWait, but what if all lanterns are at the same point x, and x is somewhere in the middle. Then the coverage would be [x-d, x+d]. To cover the entire street, we need x-d <=0 and x+d >= l. So d must be at least max(x, l-x). So for example, if x is 5 and l is 10, d needs to be 5.\n\nSo the minimal d is max(x, l - x).\n\nWait, but in the case where multiple lanterns are at the same point, perhaps they can combine to cover the entire street with a smaller d. Wait, no, because all lanterns are at the same point. So their combined coverage is the same as a single lantern at that point. So the minimal d is as before.\n\nAnother edge case: a single lantern at position x. Then the minimal d is max(x, l - x).\n\nWait, no. Because the coverage would be [x-d, x+d], and to cover the entire street, x-d must be <=0 and x+d >= l. So d >= x and d >= l - x. So minimal d is max(x, l - x).\n\nSo, that's another edge case.\n\nSo, now, considering the code.\n\nIn Python, I'll read the input, process the a_i, sort them, perform binary search, and compute the required d.\n\nBut wait, the input format is a bit tricky. The first line is two integers, n and l. The second line is a string with n numbers, separated by spaces.\n\nSo, for the sample input, the first line is '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', which means n=7, l=15, and the lantern positions are [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. So we need to parse this correctly.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead the first line as n, l = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen read the next line, split into a list of integers, and convert to a list.\n\nBut in the sample input, it's written as a string like '2 5\\n2 5', which is two lines: first line is n=2, l=5; second line is the lanterns at 2 and 5.\n\nSo in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nWait, no. Because the input is a string, but when using input(), it reads until the newline, which for the second line is '2 5\\n2 5'—wait no, wait, the second line is '2 5\\n2 5'? Or wait, looking back at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWait, perhaps it's presented as two lines in the input. So in code, the first line is n and l, and the second line is the list of a_i.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nline1 = input().strip()\nn, l = map(int, line1.split())\n\nline2 = input().strip()\na = list(map(int, line2.split()))\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the code will read n and l, then the list of a_i.\n\nOnce the a_i are sorted, proceed with the binary search.\n\nNow, implementing the check function.\n\nImplement a helper function is_covered(d) that returns True if with this d, the entire street is covered.\n\ndef is_covered(d):\n    # Sort the a_i\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    prev_end = 0\n    for ai in a_sorted:\n        start = max(0, ai - d)\n        end = min(l, ai + d)\n        if start > prev_end:\n            return False\n        prev_end = max(prev_end, end)\n    return prev_end >= l\n\nWait, but after processing all a_i, we have to make sure that prev_end is >= l.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, with that, the binary search can proceed.\n\nNow, the binary search's initial low is 0, but since d must be positive, perhaps set low to 1e-12 or something.\n\nWait, but the problem allows d=0.0? No, because the problem says d is a positive number. So, d must be greater than zero.\n\nSo, the initial low can be 0, but in practice, it's better to set it to a very small epsilon, like 1e-12.\n\nWait, but in the binary search, if low is 0, but d must be positive, perhaps we should start with low = 1e-12.\n\nBut perhaps the binary search can handle it.\n\nWait, for example, in the case where all lanterns are at 0, then d needs to be at least l. So, during the binary search, if d is 0, the coverage is [0,0], which doesn't cover the entire street. So the function would return false, and the binary search would adjust.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial low can be 0, and high can be l, and proceed normally.\n\nBut perhaps to avoid issues with d being zero, we can set low to a very small value, like 1e-12, and high to l.\n\nNow, the binary search proceeds.\n\nOnce the binary search converges, we need to print the result with 10 decimal places.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=7, l=15\n\na = [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]\n\nWhen sorted, a becomes [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nFor the first sample, what's the required d?\n\nEach lantern's coverage:\n\n Lantern 0: [0 - d, 0 +d] → [0, d]\n Lantern 3: [3-d, 3+d]\n Lantern 5: [5-d, 5+d]\n etc.\n\nThe idea is that the maximum gap between the end of one and the start of the next determines the required d.\n\nWait, but perhaps the minimal d is determined by the largest distance between consecutive coverage regions.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal d is the minimal value that ensures that the coverage of each lantern overlaps sufficiently with the next.\n\nBut in the binary search approach, the function is correct.\n\nSo, in code, the binary search will find the minimal d.\n\nNow, the sample output is 2.5000000000.\n\nSo, in the first sample, the minimal d is 2.5.\n\nLet me see why.\n\nThe sorted a_i are 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nCompute for d=2.5:\n\nLantern 0: 0-2.5= -2.5 → 0; 0+2.5=2.5 → 2.5. Coverage [0, 2.5].\n\nLantern3: 3-2.5=0.5; 3+2.5=5.5. So coverage [0.5,5.5].\n\nLantern5: 5-2.5=2.5; 5+2.5=7.5. So coverage [2.5,7.5].\n\nLantern7: 7-2.5=4.5; 7+2.5=9.5. So [4.5,9.5].\n\nLantern9: 9-2.5=6.5; 9+2.5=11.5. [6.5, 11.5].\n\nLantern14: 14-2.5=11.5; 14+2.5=16.5, but l=15. So [11.5,15].\n\nLantern15: 15-2.5=12.5; 15+2.5=17.5 → [12.5,15].\n\nNow, merging all these:\n\nStart with 0-2.5.\n\nNext, 0.5-5.5: so merged becomes 0-7.5.\n\nNext, 2.5-7.5: already included.\n\nNext, 4.5-9.5: merged to 0-9.5.\n\nNext,6.5-11.5: merged to 0-11.5.\n\nNext,11.5-15: merged to 0-15.\n\nSo the entire street is covered.\n\nBut wait, what's the maximum gap between the coverage areas?\n\nLooking at the initial sorted a_i, the coverage for each lantern:\n\n0-2.5, then 0.5-5.5. So the first gap is from 2.5 to 0.5? No, wait, no. The coverage starts at 0.5, which is within the previous coverage (0-2.5). So no gap.\n\nWait, perhaps the gaps are between the end of one lantern's coverage and the start of the next.\n\nSo let's process the sorted a_i and compute the coverage:\n\nprev_end = 0\n\nProcess 0: coverage is 0-2.5. prev_end becomes 2.5.\n\nProcess 3: coverage is 0.5-5.5. So since 0.5 < 2.5, the prev_end is updated to 5.5.\n\nProcess 5: coverage is 2.5-7.5. 2.5 < 5.5, so prev_end is 7.5.\n\nProcess7: coverage is4.5-9.5. 4.5 <7.5, so prev_end becomes9.5.\n\nProcess9: coverage is6.5-11.5. 6.5 <9.5 → prev_end is11.5.\n\nProcess14: coverage is11.5-15. 11.5 <11.5? No. So prev_end is 15.\n\nProcess15: coverage is12.5-15. 12.5 <15 → prev_end remains 15.\n\nSo the entire street is covered.\n\nThus, d=2.5 is sufficient.\n\nIs there a smaller d?\n\nWhat if d=2.4?\n\nCompute for each lantern:\n\n0: 0-2.4 → 0-2.4.\n\n3: 3-2.4=0.6; 3+2.4=5.4 → 0.6-5.4.\n\n5:5-2.4=2.6;5+2.4=7.4 → 2.6-7.4.\n\n7:7-2.4=4.6;7+2.4=9.4 →4.6-9.4.\n\n9:9-2.4=6.6;9+2.4=11.4 →6.6-11.4.\n\n14:14-2.4=11.6;14+2.4=16.4 →11.6-15.\n\n15:15-2.4=12.6;15+2.4=17.4 →12.6-15.\n\nNow, process in order:\n\nprev_end=0.\n\n0: coverage 0-2.4 → prev_end=2.4.\n\n3: 0.6-5.4. Since 0.6 <2.4, prev_end becomes5.4.\n\n5:2.6-7.4. 2.6 <5.4 → prev_end=7.4.\n\n7:4.6-9.4. 4.6 <7.4 → prev_end=9.4.\n\n9:6.6-11.4. 6.6 <9.4 → prev_end=11.4.\n\n14:11.6-15. 11.6 <11.4? No, 11.6>11.4. So there's a gap between 11.4 and 11.6. Thus, the function returns False. So d=2.4 is insufficient.\n\nHence, the minimal d is 2.5.\n\nSo the sample output is 2.5.\n\nSimilarly, the second sample has n=2, l=5, a=[2,5]. When sorted, a is [2,5].\n\nFor d=2:\n\nLantern2: 0 to4.\n\nLantern5:3 to5.\n\nCoverage is [0,4] and [3,5]. So the union is [0,5], covering the entire street.\n\nIf d is 2, it works.\n\nWhat about d=1.9?\n\nLantern2:0.1 to3.9.\n\nLantern5:3.1 to6.9, but l=5 →3.1 to5.\n\nSo the coverage is [0.1,3.9] and [3.1,5]. The union is [0.1,5]. So 0 is covered, but 0.1 is okay. However, what about 0? Yes, 0.1 is close to 0. So it's covered.\n\nWait, wait: the lantern2's coverage is 2-1.9=0.1, 2+1.9=3.9. So from 0.1 to3.9.\n\nLantern5's coverage is5-1.9=3.1, 5+1.9=6.9, but capped at 5. So 3.1 to5.\n\nSo the union is from 0.1 to5. So 0 is not covered. So the function returns false, meaning d=1.9 is insufficient.\n\nThus, the minimal d is indeed 2.\n\nSo, the code should handle this correctly.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. So the minimal d is max(5, 10-5)=5. So the coverage is 0 to10.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, l=10, a=[1,6,9]. What's the minimal d?\n\nSorted a:1,6,9.\n\nFor d=3:\n\n1: -2 →0; 4.\n\n6:3 →9.\n\n9:6→12→10.\n\nSo the coverage is 0-4, 3-9, 6-10.\n\nUnion is 0-10.\n\nIs there a smaller d?\n\nTry d=2.5.\n\n1: -0.5→0; 3.5.\n\n6:3.5→8.5.\n\n9:6.5→11.5→10.\n\nSo coverage:\n\n0-3.5, 3.5-8.5, 6.5-10.\n\nSo the union is 0-10.\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nAfter 0-3.5, then 3.5-8.5: so 0-8.5.\n\nThen 6.5-10: so 0-10.\n\nYes.\n\nSo d=2.5 is sufficient.\n\nBut is it possible to have a smaller d?\n\nWhat about d=2.4.\n\n1: 1-2.4= -1.4 →0; 1+2.4=3.4.\n\n6:6-2.4=3.6;6+2.4=8.4.\n\n9:9-2.4=6.6;9+2.4=11.4 →6.6-10.\n\nCoverage:\n\n0-3.4, 3.6-8.4, 6.6-10.\n\nCheck if the union covers 0-10.\n\nBetween 0-3.4 and 3.6-8.4: there's a small gap at 3.4 to3.6. So the function would return false.\n\nThus, d=2.4 is insufficient.\n\nSo the minimal d is 2.5.\n\nHmm, so the binary search approach correctly finds this.\n\nNow, thinking about the code again.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling floating points correctly, especially for very large l (up to 1e9). But since the binary search runs in log2(1e9) ~30 steps, it's manageable.\n\n- Precision: the binary search needs to continue until the difference is below 1e-10 or similar, to get 10 decimal places accurate.\n\nSo, in the binary search loop, perhaps we can run until high - low < 1e-11.\n\nSo, the code structure:\n\nn, l = ...\na = list of positions\na.sort()\n\nlow = 1e-12\nhigh = l\nepsilon = 1e-11\n\nfor _ in range(100):  # enough iterations\n    mid = (low + high) / 2\n    if is_covered(mid):\n        high = mid\n    else:\n        low = mid\n\nprint high with 10 decimal digits.\n\nWait, but in Python, doing 100 iterations is more than enough, as each iteration reduces the error by half.\n\nAlternatively, use a while loop that continues until high - low is less than 1e-12.\n\nBut for practical purposes, 100 iterations are sufficient.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nImplementing the is_covered function as a helper.\n\nTesting the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nSample Output: 2.5000000000.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted [2,5].\n\nSample Output: 2.0000000000.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Output is 5.0000000000.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, a=[1,6,9], l=10. Output is 2.5.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, a=[0, 5, 10], l=10.\n\nCompute required d.\n\nEach lantern's coverage:\n\nd must ensure that 0's coverage extends to 5's, and 5's extends to 10.\n\nSo for d=5: 0 covers 0-5; 5 covers 0-10; 10 covers 5-15→10. So the entire street is covered.\n\nBut what's the minimal d?\n\nWait, perhaps the required d is 5, because 0's coverage needs to reach 5, which requires d >=5. Because 0's coverage is 0-5. The next lantern is at5, which covers 0-10 with d=5. So the entire street is covered.\n\nWait, but if d is 5, then 0's coverage is 0-5, 5's coverage is 0-10, and 10's coverage is 5-15, which is 5-10.\n\nSo the entire street is covered.\n\nBut can d be smaller?\n\nSuppose d=4.9:\n\n0's coverage is 0-4.9.\n\n5's coverage is 0.1-9.9.\n\n10's coverage is 5.1-14.9 →10.\n\nSo the union is 0-9.9 and 5.1-10. So the entire street is covered except for 9.9 to 10. But 10 is covered by 5's coverage (up to9.9), but 10 itself is only covered by the 10 lantern's coverage, which starts at5.1.\n\nWait, 10 is the end of the street. So 10's coverage is 5.1-14.9→10 is included.\n\nWait, no: 10's coverage is 10-4.9=5.1, 10+4.9=14.9. So 10 is covered.\n\nWait, but the 5's coverage is 0.1 to9.9. So 9.9 is just below 10.\n\nSo 10 is covered by the 10's coverage (5.1-14.9).\n\nSo the entire street is covered.\n\nWait, so with d=4.9, it's sufficient.\n\nHmm, but perhaps my earlier reasoning was incorrect.\n\nWait, the 0's coverage is 0-4.9. 5's coverage is 0.1-9.9. 10's coverage is5.1-14.9.\n\nSo from 0-4.9, 0.1-9.9, and 5.1-14.9.\n\nSo the entire street is covered from 0 to14.9, but l is 10. So it's covered.\n\nSo perhaps the minimal d is less than5.\n\nBut wait, what about d=4.5.\n\n0's coverage: 0-4.5.\n\n5's coverage: 0.5-9.5.\n\n10's coverage:5.5-14.5.\n\nSo the entire street is covered.\n\nSo the minimal d is when the first lantern's coverage reaches up to the next lantern's coverage.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal d is determined by the maximum of the required d for each consecutive pair.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal d is the maximum of (a_i - a_{i-1})/2, for all i, plus the required to cover the ends.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the maximum of (distance between consecutive lanterns) / 2, because each pair must be within 2d apart to overlap.\n\nNo, that's not correct. Because for two lanterns, the required d is (distance)/2.\n\nFor example, two lanterns at 0 and l. Required d is l/2.\n\nBut if three lanterns are at 0, l/2, l, then the required d is l/4.\n\nBecause the first covers 0 to d, the second covers (l/2 -d) to (l/2 +d). To cover the entire street, the second's coverage must extend into the first's, which may not require a specific d for each pair, but overall.\n\nSo the binary search approach is more accurate.\n\nSo, the code should correctly compute the required d.\n\nThus, the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns on a street light the entire street from point 0 to point \\( l \\). Each lantern lights a segment of the street from \\( (ai - d) \\) to \\( (ai + d) \\), where \\( ai \\) is the position of the lantern.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to find the smallest \\( d \\) such that the union of all segments covered by the lanterns covers the entire street from 0 to \\( l \\). This can be efficiently solved using binary search.\n2. **Binary Search**: We perform a binary search on \\( d \\) because the function checking if a given \\( d \\) covers the entire street is monotonic. If a certain \\( d \\) covers the street, any larger \\( d \\) will also cover it.\n3. **Check Function**: For each candidate \\( d \\) during the binary search, we check if the union of all segments covered by the lanterns covers the entire street. This is done by iterating through each lantern's coverage and ensuring there are no gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n4. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where all lanterns are at the same point or at the ends of the street.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_covered(d, a, l):\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    prev_end = 0\n    for ai in a_sorted:\n        start = max(0, ai - d)\n        end = min(l, ai + d)\n        if start > prev_end:\n            return False\n        prev_end = max(prev_end, end)\n    return prev_end >= l\n\ndef find_min_d(n, l, a):\n    a = list(map(int, a))\n    a.sort()\n    low = 1e-12\n    high = l\n    epsilon = 1e-11\n    for _ in range(100):\n        mid = (low + high) / 2\n        if is_covered(mid, a, l):\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid\n    return high\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\n\nline1 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nn, l = map(int, line1.split())\nline2 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\na = list(map(int, line2.split()))\n\nmin_d = find_min_d(n, l, a)\n\n# Print with 10 decimal places\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(min_d))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of lanterns \\( n \\), the length of the street \\( l \\), and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting Lanterns**: The positions of the lanterns are sorted to facilitate the coverage check.\n3. **Binary Search**: The binary search is performed over the possible values of \\( d \\) starting from a very small value up to \\( l \\). For each midpoint \\( d \\), we check if it covers the entire street.\n4. **Coverage Check**: For each \\( d \\), we check if the union of all segments covered by the lanterns covers the entire street. If it does, we adjust the binary search bounds to find a smaller \\( d \\); otherwise, we increase \\( d \\).\n5. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum \\( d \\) using binary search, making the solution both optimal and efficient.",
