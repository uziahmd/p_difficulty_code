The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Xenia is trying to complete her tasks by moving along a ringroad. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem statement says that Xenia lives in a city with n houses arranged in a ring. The traffic is one-way and clockwise. She starts at house 1 and has m tasks. For each task i, she must be at house ai, and she needs to have completed all tasks with numbers less than i before. So the order of the tasks matters because each subsequent task must be handled after the previous ones.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks. Each move from one house to an adjacent one takes one unit of time.\n\nHmm. So, what's the strategy here? I think we need to model her movements efficiently, considering the constraints of the tasks.\n\nLet me think about how she moves. She starts at house 1. The first task is to go to a1, but wait, no: actually, for each task i, she must be at ai after completing all tasks j < i. So the order in which she does the tasks is important. But the given list of ai's may not be in any particular order. So perhaps the first thing is to sort them in the order they are processed.\n\nWait, wait. Oh right! Because for each task i, it has to be done before i+1-th task. So the sequence is 1, then a1, then a2, etc., but that's not necessarily the case because a1 could be a2 or something else. Wait, no. Let's see: the first task is a1, which must be done first. Then the second task is a2, which must be done after a1. So the order of processing the tasks is determined by the sorted order of their positions. Because to get to a higher-numbered task, you might have to go through higher-numbered houses.\n\nWait, but the ring is circular, so maybe the minimal path would involve going around the ring as needed.\n\nSo perhaps the key is to process the tasks in the order of increasing a_i. That way, each task is visited only once, and we can compute the minimal distance by moving from one to the next in the sorted order, considering the starting point.\n\nWait, let's think about the example given. In the first sample input:\n\n4 3\n3 2 3\n\nSo the sorted order of the tasks is 2, 3, 3. So she starts at 1. She needs to go to 2, then to 3, then to 3 again. Wait, but the output is 6. How does that add up?\n\nWait, the sample explanation shows the sequence as 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's count the steps: 1 to 2 is 1, 2→3 is another, 3→4 is 3 steps so far. Then 4→1 is 4, 1→2 is 5, 2→3 is 6. So total 6 steps.\n\nBut if she goes directly from 1 to 2, then to 3, then back to 3 (since the third task is also 3), that's 1 (1->2) + 1 (2->3) + 0 (stays at 3) = 2 steps. But that's way less than 6. So why isn't that the case?\n\nOh wait, no, because the problem says that each task must be done in order. So the first task is 3, the second is 2, the third is 3. So she must do the first task (3) first, then the second (2), then the third (3). So the order of processing is 3, 2, 3.\n\nWait, no, wait! The problem says that for the i-th task, she needs to be at ai and have completed all j < i. So the order is the original order of the tasks as given. So in the first sample, the tasks are 3, 2, 3. So she has to go to 3 first, then to 2, then to 3 again.\n\nAh, okay, that changes everything. So the order is based on the indices, not the values. So in the first sample, she first does task 1 (a1=3), then task 2 (a2=2), then task 3 (a3=3).\n\nSo the processing order is the original order of the a_i's. So the initial idea of sorting them is incorrect. Hmm. That complicates things.\n\nWait, but how do we model the movement when the order of the tasks is arbitrary?\n\nSo, for each task i, she must visit ai, but after having done all tasks before i. So the minimal path",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks when moving along a ring-shaped road in a city. Each task must be completed in the given order, and each move from one house to an adjacent one takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Xenia starts at house 1 and has to complete tasks in the given order. Each task requires her to be at a specific house after completing all previous tasks.\n2. **Movement Constraints**: The ringroad is one-way and clockwise, meaning she can only move in the direction of increasing house numbers.\n3. **Optimal Path Calculation**: To minimize the time, we need to consider the shortest path between consecutive tasks while ensuring that each task is completed in the given order.\n\nThe approach involves simulating Xenia's movement step by step:\n- Start at house 1.\n- For each task, calculate the shortest path from her current position to the required house for that task.\n- Sum up these distances to get the total time required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor ai in tasks:\n    # Calculate distance from current to ai\n    if ai > current:\n        total_time += (ai - current)\n    else:\n        # If ai is smaller, go around the ring\n        total_time += (n - current) + ai\n    current = ai\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with total time set to 0.\n- **Iterate through Tasks**: For each task, determine the shortest path from the current house to the required house.\n  - If the next house number is higher than the current, move directly there.\n  - If the next house number is lower, wrap around the ring to reach it, which involves moving from the current house to the end of the ring and then to the next house.\n- **Update Position**: After each task, update the current position to the house where the task was completed.\n- **Output Total Time**: Print the accumulated total time after all tasks are completed.\n\nThis approach ensures that Xenia completes each task in the given order with the minimum possible time, considering the constraints of the ring-shaped road.",
