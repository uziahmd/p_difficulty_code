При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a possible error in message transmission between servers. When two identical messages are sent one after another, there might be an error where they merge into one. The way they merge is by overlapping as much as possible. So, the end of the first message is connected with the start of the second. But this can only happen if the overlapping part has the same characters. Also, the length of the overlap must be at least 1 and less than the length of the message.\n\nMy task is, given a string t, determine whether it could have resulted from such an error. If yes, output \"YES\" followed by a possible original message s. Otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\nHmm. So, for example, if t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra', maybe it was formed by two 'abrakadabra's overlapping by 4 letters. Or maybe by some other number.\n\nBut wait, how do I approach this?\n\nLet's think about the structure of the string t. It should consist of two copies of some string s, but with an overlap in the middle. So, t can be split into s + s', where s' is the second part which overlaps with the first. But wait, no—because when two messages are sent, the first is s, then the second is s. Due to the error, they merge into s concatenated with the suffix of the second s that doesn't overlap.\n\nWait, no. Wait: when two messages s are sent, the first is s, the second is s. Because of the error, their concatenation is s concatenated with the non-overlapping part of the second s. The maximum possible overlap is determined by the largest k where the last k characters of s equal the first k of s.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's said that the two messages are s and s. So, when they are sent, they might merge into s + s, but with the maximum possible overlap. So, the resulting string t is s concatenated with s, but with the maximum possible overlapping.\n\nSo, for example, if s is 'abc', then sending two 'abc's would result in 'abcc' if they overlap by 1 character (the 'c'), or 'abcbc' if they don't overlap (but that's not allowed because the overlap must be positive but less than the entire string). Wait, wait, no—wait, the maximum possible k is such that 0 < k < len(s). So, for s of length n, the maximum possible k is n-1. So, when we have two s's, the merged string is s concatenated with s[k:], where k is the maximum possible where s ends with the same substring as it starts.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the two messages are s and s. When merged due to the error, the result is a string where the end of the first s is overlapped with the beginning of the second s as much as possible. So, the result is s concatenated with the suffix of the second s that doesn't overlap. So, the total length of t is len(s) + (len(s) - k), where k is the overlap. So, len(t) = 2*len(s) -k.\n\nSo, given t, I need to find s such that t can be written as s concatenated with s', where s' is a suffix of s. Or wait, more precisely, t must be equal to s concatenated with a suffix of s, where the suffix starts at position k in s. So, t = s + s', and s' is s[k:] for some k >=1 and k < len(s).\n\nWait, no. Because when two messages are sent, the first is s, the second is s. They are merged into a string that starts with s, but continues with the part of the second s that wasn't overlapped. So, the merged string is s concatenated with s[k:], where k is the maximum possible overlap.\n\nSo, for example, if s is 'abcd', and the maximum possible k is 3 (since the last three characters of s are 'bcd' and the start of s is 'bcd'?), then the merged string would be 'abcd' + 'd' → 'abcdd'? Wait, no. Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, suppose s is 'abcd'. Then the two messages are 'abcd' and 'abcd'. When they merge, the maximum possible k is 3, because 'bcd' is the last 3 of s and the first 3 of the next s. So the merged string is 'abcd' + 'd' → 'abcdd'.\n\nSo, for t to be a possible result, it must be equal to s + s[k:], where k is the maximum possible overlap.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says that the two messages are sent, and the error causes them to merge. So, the maximum possible overlap is taken. So, for any possible s, when you send two copies, the resulting t is s concatenated with s[k:], where k is the maximum possible such that s ends with the prefix of s of length k.\n\nSo, the approach is: for a given t, we need to check if it can be split into s followed by a substring which is a suffix of s, and the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the maximum possible isn't fixed. Maybe the error could have happened at any possible k, not necessarily the maximum. Wait, no—the problem statement says that the error leads to the maximum possible overlap. So, in the example where two 'abrakadabra's are sent, the merged string is formed by the maximum possible overlap, which may vary depending on the s.\n\nSo, the key is to find any possible s such that t is equal to s concatenated with a suffix of s, where the suffix starts at position k in s, for some k between 1 and len(s)-1.\n\nWait, but since the error causes the maximum possible overlap, perhaps t must have exactly this structure. So, for t to be a possible result, there exists some k (1 <=k < len(s)) such that t can be split into s and s[k:].\n\nWait, but how to find s?\n\nAnother approach: For each possible split point in t, check if the first part is s, and the second part is a suffix of s, and the split is at a position that allows s to be a possible original message.\n\nBut the issue is that the split point depends on the length of s. So, for example, if t is 'ababab', then possible splits are:\n\nSuppose s is 'aba', then t is 'aba'+'bab' (but 'bab' is not a suffix of 'aba'). So that wouldn't work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps s is 'ababab', but that would require the second part to be empty, which isn't allowed because k must be positive.\n\nWait, no. Wait, s must be such that when you concatenate s and s[k:], you get t.\n\nSo, for a given t, possible s's are of varying lengths. We need to find any s where t can be written as s + s[k:], for some k in [1, len(s)-1].\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate over all possible possible split positions in t. For each possible split position, check if the first part is s, and the second part is a suffix of s.\n\n2. For each possible split, find s, then check if the second part is indeed a suffix of s.\n\n3. Also, ensure that the split position is such that the second part is a suffix of the first part.\n\nBut how to iterate through possible s's?\n\nWait, the length of s can vary. Let me think: the length of t is len(t) = len(s) + (len(s) - k) → len(t) = 2*len(s) -k.\n\nSince k is between 1 and len(s)-1, len(t) must be equal to 2*len(s) -k, which implies that len(t) >= len(s)+1 (since k can be up to len(s)-1, making 2*len(s) - (len(s)-1) = len(s)+1).\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to consider that for a possible s, len(s) must be such that len(t) is between len(s)+1 and 2*len(s)-1.\n\nWait, for example, if s has length m, then the merged t will have length m + (m -k), which is 2m -k. Since k can be as small as 1 and as large as m-1.\n\nSo, 2m -k can range from 2m - (m-1) = m+1 to 2m -1.\n\nSo, for a given t of length L, the possible m (length of s) must satisfy m+1 <= L <= 2m-1.\n\nWhich rearranges to m >= (L+1)/2 and m <= (L+1)/2 (since 2m-1 >= L → m >= (L+1)/2, and 2m-1 <= L → m <= (L+1)/2). Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me re-express:\n\nWe have m+1 ≤ L ≤ 2m-1.\n\nSo, for L to be >= m+1 and <= 2m-1.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as m ≤ L-1 and m ≥ (L+1)/2.\n\nWait, for example, if L=5:\n\nThen m must satisfy m+1 ≤5 → m ≤4, and 5 ≤2m-1 → 2m ≥6 → m≥3.\n\nSo m can be 3,4.\n\nBecause for m=3: 3+1=4 ≤5 and 5≤2*3-1=5 → yes.\n\nFor m=4: 4+1=5 ≤5 and 5 ≤7 → yes.\n\nSo possible m's for L=5 are 3 and 4.\n\nSo, for each possible m, we can try to see if t can be written as s + s[k:], where s is of length m.\n\nSo, the steps I'll take are:\n\n1. For the input string t, compute its length L.\n\n2. For each possible m in the valid range (as per above), check if t can be split into s of length m and a suffix of s.\n\n   For each m:\n\n   a. Check if m is such that m+1 <= L <= 2m-1.\n\n   b. For each possible k in 1 to m-1:\n\n      i. Check if the first m characters of t form a string s.\n\n      ii. Check if the remaining part of t (from m onwards) is equal to s[k:].\n\n      iii. If yes, then s is a possible original message.\n\n3. Once such an s is found, output \"YES\" and s.\n\n4. If no such s exists for any m, output \"NO\".\n\nBut wait, considering that for each m, the remaining part after m must be s[k:]. So, for a given m, the length of the remaining part is L - m.\n\nBut s[k:] has length m -k. So, L - m must be equal to m -k → k = m - (L - m) → k = 2m - L.\n\nBut k must be >=1 and <= m-1.\n\nSo, substituting k = 2m - L, we have:\n\n1 ≤ 2m - L ≤ m-1.\n\nSo, adding L to all sides:\n\nL +1 ≤ 2m ≤ L + m-1.\n\nRearranged:\n\nL +1 ≤ 2m → m >= (L+1)/2.\n\nAnd 2m ≤ L + m -1 → m <= L-1.\n\nSo, combining the earlier condition, m must be in the range (L+1)/2 ≤ m ≤ L-1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the m must satisfy m+1 ≤ L ≤ 2m-1. Which is equivalent to (L+1)/2 ≤ m ≤ (L-1)/2? No, wait, let me see:\n\nWait, for m+1 ≤ L → m ≤ L-1.\n\nAnd L ≤ 2m-1 → m ≥ (L+1)/2.\n\nSo, m must be in [(L+1)/2, L-1], but since m must be integer, perhaps we can loop m from ceil((L+1)/2) to L-1.\n\nWait, but for example, L=5:\n\n(L+1)/2 = 3, and L-1=4.\n\nSo m can be 3,4.\n\nWhich aligns with the earlier example.\n\nSo, for each m in that range, compute k = 2m - L.\n\nIf k is in [1, m-1], then check whether the suffix of s (which is t[:m]) equals the remaining part of t (t[m:]).\n\nWait, but also, the remaining part must be exactly s[k:].\n\nSo, for each m in the valid range:\n\nCompute k = 2m - L.\n\nIf k is >=1 and <= m-1:\n\nThen check if t[m:] == s[k:].\n\nIf yes, then return s.\n\nSo, the algorithm becomes:\n\nFor each m from ceil( (L+1)/2 ) to L-1:\n\n   s_candidate = t[:m]\n\n   k = 2*m - L\n\n   if k <1 or k >m-1:\n\n       continue\n\n   if t[m:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n       return YES and s_candidate\n\nIf none found, return NO.\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'\n\nLength L=20.\n\nCompute m must be between (20+1)/2=10.5, so m starts at 11, up to 19.\n\nFor each m in 11..19:\n\nCompute k=2m -20.\n\nCheck if k is in [1, m-1].\n\nFor example:\n\nm=10: no, because (20+1)/2 is 10.5, so m starts at 11.\n\nWait, m must be >= ceil( (L+1)/2 ), which for L=20 is 10.5 → 11.\n\nSo for m=11:\n\nk=22-20=2.\n\nCheck if 2 is within 1<=2<=10 → yes.\n\nCheck if t[11:] is equal to s_candidate[2:].\n\ns_candidate is t[:11] → 'abrakadabr'.\n\nt[11:] is 'akadabrabrakadabra' ?\n\nWait, no, t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → length is 20.\n\nt[:11] is first 11 chars: 'abrakadabr'.\n\nt[11:] is the remaining 9 chars: 'akadabrabr'.\n\nWait, but k=2, so s_candidate[2:] is 'rakadabr'.\n\nCompare with t[11:] which is 'akadabrabr' → not equal. So no.\n\nNext m=12:\n\nk=24-20=4.\n\nCheck if 4 is between 1 and 11.\n\nYes.\n\ns_candidate = t[:12] → 'abrakadabr a' (assuming 12 letters).\n\nt[12:] is 'brakadabrabr a' → not sure, but check if it equals s_candidate[4:].\n\ns_candidate[4:] is 'kadabr a' (assuming 8 letters left in t).\n\nBut t[12:] is 'brakadabrabr a' → maybe not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to take specific examples.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the correct answer is 'YES' and s is 'abrakadabra' which has length 11. Because when you send two 11-length messages, the maximum possible overlap is 4, so the merged string is 11 + (11-4) =16? Wait, no. Wait, 11 +7=18. But the sample input has a longer string.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's look at the sample.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\nSo for the first case, t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is length 20.\n\nThe correct s is 'abrakadabra' of length 11.\n\nWhen two s's are sent, the maximum possible overlap is 4, so the merged string is s + s[7:] → 'abrakadabra' + 'brakadabra'[7:] → 'abrakadabra' + 'bra' → 'abrakadabrabra'? No, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the process.\n\nWait, when two s's are sent, the merged string is formed by the maximum possible overlap. So, the first s is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters), the second is 'abrakadabra'. The maximum overlap is the maximum k where the end of the first s matches the start of the second s.\n\nLooking for the maximum k where s ends with the first k letters of s.\n\nSo, for 'abrakadabra':\n\nCheck for the maximum k where s[-k:] == s[:k].\n\nWe can compute this for k from min(len(s)-1, len(s)) down to 1.\n\nWait, for k=11: not possible, since it's the entire string.\n\nk=10: s[-10:] == s[:10]?\n\nCheck 'rakadabra' vs 'abrakadab' → not equal.\n\nk=9: 'akadabra' vs 'abrakadab' → no.\n\nk=8: 'kadabra' vs 'abrakada' → no.\n\nk=4: 'abra' vs 'ab...' → wait, what is s[:4]? 'ab r a' → 'ab r a' is 'ab r a'?\n\nWait, 'abrakadabra' is spelled as 'a b r a k a d a b r a' → indices 0-10.\n\ns[:4] is 'ab r a' → 'ab' 'r a'? Wait, no, s[:4] is the first four letters: 'ab r a' → 'ab r a' is 'abr a'?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let's think differently.\n\nOnce s is determined, the merged string is s concatenated with s[k:], where k is the maximum possible overlap.\n\nSo, for the first sample, t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 20 letters.\n\nIf s is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters), then the maximum k is 4.\n\nSo, the merged string is s + s[7:] → 'abrakadabra' + 'brakadabra'[7:] → 'abrakadabra' + 'bra' → 'abrakadabrabra' → 11 +3=14 letters. But the sample t is longer.\n\nWait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is that when two s's are sent, the merged string is s concatenated with s[k:], where k is the maximum possible.\n\nSo, the length of t is 2*len(s) -k.\n\nIn the first sample, len(t)=20. So 2m -k=20, where m is len(s).\n\nWe need to find m and k such that m = (20 +k)/2.\n\nBut k must be <=m-1.\n\nSo for m=11: 2*11 -k=20 → k=2.\n\nSo, the merged string is s + s[2:].\n\nSo, s is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters), s[2:] is 'rakadabra' (9 letters). So the merged string is 'abrakadabra' + 'rakadabra' → total 20 letters.\n\nWhich matches the sample t.\n\nSo, in our algorithm, for m=11, k=2, we check if t[11:] == s[2:].\n\nYes, because t[11:] is 'rakadabra'.\n\nSo, the algorithm would find this.\n\nThus, the algorithm works.\n\nAnother example:\n\nSecond sample input is 'acacacaca' → output is 'YES\\nacaca'.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nt is 'acacacaca' → length 9.\n\nPossible m's are (9+1)/2=5, so m starts at 5, up to 8.\n\nFor m=5:\n\nk=2*5-9=1.\n\nCheck if t[5:] equals s[1:].\n\ns is 'acaca'.\n\ns[1:] is 'caca'.\n\nt[5:] is 'caca'.\n\nSo, yes. So the algorithm finds this.\n\nThird example:\n\nInput 'abcabc' → output 'NO'.\n\nBecause, for m=3: t is 'abc' + 'abc' → 'abcabc' → but according to the problem statement, if two messages are sent and the error happens, the result is a merged string. But in this case, the two messages are the same, but the error didn't happen because the messages were not sent back to back. Or perhaps the problem says that a simple concatenation without error is not considered an error.\n\nWait, the note in the problem says:\n\nNote that the situation where the two messages are completely overlapped is not considered an error. For example, 'abcd' is not considered an error.\n\nSo, in this case, 'abcabc' is the concatenation of 'abc' and 'abc' without any error. So the algorithm correctly returns 'NO' because the string is just two copies, but without any overlap. So the algorithm won't find any m where t[m:] is a suffix of s.\n\nBecause for m=3:\n\nk=2*3 -6=0 → invalid.\n\nSo, for m=3, k=0, which is invalid.\n\nFor m=4:\n\nk=8-6=2. So s is t[:4]='abca'. s[2:] is 'ca'. t[4:] is 'bc' → not equal.\n\nSimilarly, for m=5:\n\nk=10-6=4. s is 'abcab', s[4:] is 'b'. t[5:] is 'c' → not equal.\n\nThus, no solution.\n\nSo, the algorithm correctly returns 'NO'.\n\nAnother example: 'abababab' → output 'YES\\nababab'.\n\nLength is 8.\n\nPossible m's: (8+1)/2=4.5 → m starts at 5, up to 7.\n\nFor m=5:\n\nk=10-8=2.\n\ns is t[:5] → 'ababa'.\n\nt[5:] is 'babab'.\n\ns[2:] is 'ba babab' ? Wait, s is 'ababa', s[2:] is 'ba ba' → 'ba ba' is 'ba ba' → 'ba ba' is 'bab a'? Wait, no, 'ababa' is 5 letters: a b a b a.\n\ns[2:] is 'aba'.\n\nt[5:] is 'babab' → length 3, but 'aba' is length 3. So 'babab' is 5 letters, but 'aba' is 3 letters → can't match.\n\nSo, no.\n\nFor m=6:\n\nk=12-8=4.\n\ns is 'ababab'.\n\ns[4:] is 'ab'.\n\nt[6:] is 'abab' → 'abab' vs 'ab' → no.\n\nWait, but wait, s is 'ababab' (6 letters). s[4:] is the substring starting at index 4: 'ab'.\n\nt[6:] is 'abab' (4 letters) → 'abab' vs 'ab' → no.\n\nSo, no.\n\nFor m=4:\n\nWait, m must be >= (8+1)/2=4.5 → m=5 and up.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the correct m is 6.\n\nWait, no: the sample output is 'YES\\nababab', which is length 6. So for m=6, k=2*6-8=4.\n\ns is 'ababab'.\n\nt is 'abababab' → len 8.\n\nt[6:] is 'ab'.\n\ns[4:] is 'ab' → yes.\n\nSo, the algorithm finds this.\n\nSo, the code needs to process m=6, check if k=4 is valid, and then compare.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the algorithm works.\n\nNow, the plan is:\n\nImplement the following steps:\n\n1. Read t.\n\n2. Compute L = len(t).\n\n3. For m in range from ceil( (L+1)/2 ) to L-1:\n\n   a. Compute k = 2*m - L.\n\n   b. If k is not in [1, m-1], skip.\n\n   c. Check if t[m:] == s_candidate[k:].\n\n   d. If yes, output 'YES' and s_candidate.\n\n4. If no such m found, output 'NO'.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, how to handle cases where m is larger than L? Well, since m ranges up to L-1, and in the loop m goes from (L+1)//2 to L-1.\n\nBut in code, for L=0, but the problem says t is non-empty.\n\nWait, the input is a non-empty string.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead t from stdin.\n\nCompute L = len(t).\n\nIf L ==0: print 'NO' (but problem says input is non-empty).\n\nElse:\n\nLoop m from (L+1)//2 to L-1 inclusive.\n\nFor each m:\n\n   s_candidate = t[:m]\n\n   k = 2*m - L\n\n   if k <1 or k >= m:  # since k must be <= m-1\n\n       continue\n\n   if len(t[m:]) != len(s_candidate) -k:\n\n       continue  # since the suffix must match\n\n   suffix_part = t[m:]\n\n   if suffix_part == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n       print(\"YES\")\n\n       print(s_candidate)\n\n       exit.\n\nAfter all m's checked, print 'NO'.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nNow, test edge cases.\n\nTest case 1: t='ab'.\n\nPossible m is (2+1)/2=1.5 → ceil is 2. m ranges from 2 to 1 → no m's. So output 'NO'.\n\nWait, but for m=1: 1+1=2 <=2 <= 2*1-1=1 → 2>1, so m=1 is not in the range.\n\nSo, 'ab' cannot be formed by merging two single-character messages, because the merged string would have len 1+1 -k, but k must be 1 (since len(s)=1), but 1 >=1 is not allowed.\n\nSo, 'ab' is not a possible result.\n\nAnother test case: t='aaaaa'.\n\nPossible m's: (5+1)/2=3, up to 4.\n\nm=3:\n\nk=6-5=1.\n\ns_candidate is 'aaa'.\n\nt[3:] is 'aa'.\n\ns_candidate[1:] is 'aa' → matches.\n\nSo, output 'YES' and 'aaa'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: t='aaaa'.\n\nPossible m's: (4+1)/2=2.5 → m=3,4.\n\nm=3:\n\nk=6-4=2.\n\ns_candidate='aaa' → t[3:] is 'a'.\n\ns_candidate[2:] is 'aa' → 'a' vs 'aa' → no.\n\nm=4:\n\nk=8-4=4 → which is >=m (since m=4 → k must be <=3). So invalid.\n\nThus, no solution. So output 'NO'.\n\nWait, but wait: when m=3, k=2, s_candidate is 'aaa'.\n\nt[3:] is 'a' → len 1.\n\ns_candidate[2:] is 'aa' → len 2. So, 1 != 2 → no.\n\nThus, no.\n\nThus, the code correctly returns 'NO'.\n\nAnother test case: t='aabbaabb'.\n\nWait, len=8.\n\nPossible m's: 5,6,7.\n\nFor m=5:\n\nk=10-8=2.\n\ns_candidate='aabba'.\n\nt[5:] is 'aabb'.\n\ns_candidate[2:] is 'bba' → 'aabb' vs 'bba' → no.\n\nm=6:\n\nk=12-8=4.\n\ns_candidate='aabbaa'.\n\nt[6:] is 'bb'.\n\ns_candidate[4:] is 'aa' → 'bb' vs 'aa' → no.\n\nm=7:\n\nk=14-8=6.\n\ns_candidate='aabbaab'.\n\nt[7:] is 'b'.\n\ns_candidate[6:] is 'b' → yes.\n\nSo, output 'YES' and 'aabbaab'.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, time to write the code.\n\nBut wait, in the code, how to handle the loop for m?\n\nIn Python, the range is from (L+1)//2 to L-1, inclusive.\n\nBut for example, when L=8:\n\n(L+1)//2 = (9)//2=4.\n\nBut m must be >=5.\n\nSo, in code, for m in range( (L+1)//2, L ).\n\nBecause in Python, the upper bound is exclusive.\n\nWait, wait:\n\nWait, for L=8, m must be from 5 to7 (inclusive).\n\nrange(5, 8) → 5,6,7.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for L=5:\n\nrange(3,5) → 3,4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor m in range( (L+1)//2, L ):\n\n   ...\n\nThus, the code is:\n\nRead t.\n\nL = len(t)\n\nif L <2: \n\n    # since even if m=1, k=2*1-L = 2 - L. For L=1, k=1, which is m-1=0 → invalid.\n\n    # So, for L=1, no solution.\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    for m in range( (L+1)//2, L ):\n\n        k = 2 * m - L\n\n        if k <1 or k >=m:\n\n            continue\n\n        s_candidate = t[:m]\n\n        suffix = t[m:]\n\n        if len(suffix) != len(s_candidate) - k:\n\n            continue\n\n        if suffix == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n            print(s_candidate)\n\n            exit()\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but wait: for m= (L+1)//2, when L is even.\n\nE.g., L=6 → (6+1)/2=3.5 → floor is 3, but in code (L+1)//2 is 3.\n\nWait, no, in Python, (6+1)//2 is 3 (since 7//2=3).\n\nBut for L=6, m must be >=4 (since (6+1)/2=3.5 → ceil is 4).\n\nSo, in code, the range is from 3 to 6 → 3,4,5.\n\nWait, that's incorrect.\n\nWait, for L=6, the valid m's are 4 and 5.\n\nBecause (6+1)/2 is 3.5 → m starts at 4.\n\nSo, the range in code is from (L+1)//2=3 to L=6, which includes 3,4,5,6.\n\nBut for m=3:\n\nm=3.\n\nk=6-6=0 → invalid.\n\nSo, in code, it's skipped.\n\nThus, the code correctly processes m=4 and 5.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nWait, but for L=6, the m runs from 3 to 6 (exclusive of 6), so 3,4,5.\n\nBut for m=3, k=6-6=0 → invalid.\n\nSo, the code skips.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: L=2.\n\nt = 'aa'.\n\nm runs from (2+1)//2=1 to 2.\n\nSo m=1,2.\n\nm=1:\n\nk=2*1 -2=0 → invalid.\n\nm=2:\n\nk=4-2=2 → but m=2 → k must be <2 → 2>=2 → invalid.\n\nThus, no solution → output 'NO'.\n\nWhich is correct, because two 'a's merged would give 'aa' with k=1, but according to the code, no solution.\n\nWait, but wait: in reality, two 'a's sent would merge into 'aa' with k=1, which is allowed.\n\nBut according to the code, m=1, k=0 is invalid.\n\nWait, this suggests a bug.\n\nWait, for m=1, k=2*1 -2=0 → invalid.\n\nSo, the code would not process m=1.\n\nBut when m=1, s_candidate is 'a', and t[m:] is 'a'.\n\ns_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[0:] → 'a'.\n\nThus, t[m:] is 'a' → equal.\n\nSo, why does the code not find this?\n\nAh, because for m=1, k=0, which is invalid.\n\nBut in reality, the error can happen when the two messages are 'a' and 'a', which merge into 'a'+'' → 'a'? Or wait, no, the error causes them to merge into s concatenated with s[k:], where k is the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but for s of length 1, the maximum possible k is 0, which is not allowed. So, in this case, the error is not possible, because the maximum k can't be zero.\n\nWait, no: for s of length m=1, the maximum possible k is m-1=0. So, it's not allowed.\n\nThus, the code correctly returns 'NO' for t='aa' because the two 'a's would have to merge with k=0, which is invalid.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have resulted from an error in the transmission of two identical messages. The error causes the two messages to merge by overlapping as much as possible. Our task is to identify if such a scenario is possible and, if so, find one possible original message that could have caused this error.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: When two identical messages are sent consecutively, they might merge due to an error. The result is a string where the end of the first message overlaps with the start of the second message by the maximum possible length. This overlap must be at least 1 character and less than the length of the message.\n\n2. **Check Possible Splits**: For each possible length `m` of the original message `s`, check if `t` can be split into `s` followed by a suffix of `s`. The valid range for `m` is determined by the length of `t` (denoted as `L`), specifically from `(L + 1) // 2` to `L - 1`.\n\n3. **Determine Overlap**: For each valid `m`, calculate the potential overlap length `k` as `2 * m - L`. Ensure `k` is within the valid range [1, m-1]. If valid, check if the suffix of `s` matches the corresponding part of `t`.\n\n4. **Output Result**: If a valid split is found, output \"YES\" and the original message. If no valid split is found after checking all possibilities, output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\nL = len(t)\nif L < 2:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    found = False\n    for m in range((L + 1) // 2, L):\n        k = 2 * m - L\n        if k < 1 or k >= m:\n            continue\n        s_candidate = t[:m]\n        suffix = t[m:]\n        if len(suffix) != len(s_candidate) - k:\n            continue\n        if suffix == s_candidate[k:]:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            print(s_candidate)\n            found = True\n            break\n    if not found:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string `t` is read and its length `L` is determined.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If `t` is too short (length less than 2), it immediately outputs \"NO\".\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: For each possible length `m` of the original message, starting from `(L + 1) // 2` to `L - 1`.\n4. **Calculate Overlap**: For each `m`, compute the overlap length `k` and check if it is valid.\n5. **Check Suffix Match**: Verify if the suffix of the candidate message matches the corresponding part of `t`.\n6. **Output Result**: Print \"YES\" and the candidate message if a valid split is found. Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible scenarios where the string `t` could have resulted from an error in message transmission, ensuring correctness and handling all edge cases.",
