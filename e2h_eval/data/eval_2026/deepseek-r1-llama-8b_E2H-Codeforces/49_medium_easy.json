They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if it's possible to assign a number of mushrooms to each lawn such that all the given roads' GCD and LCM constraints are satisfied. And if it's possible, I have to output any valid assignment.\n\nHmm, let's think about the problem. Each edge between two vertices (lawns) gives us a pair (g, l), which is the GCD and LCM of the mushrooms on those two vertices. So for two connected lawns u and v, their mushroom counts must satisfy:\n- gcd(u, v) = g\n- lcm(u, v) = l\n\nWait, but wait—no, actually, the problem says that on each road, they wrote the GCD and LCM of the two numbers. So for the two ends u and v, we have:\nu and v must satisfy that their GCD is the given GCD, and their LCM is the given LCM.\n\nBut wait, that's not necessarily correct because for any two numbers, the product of their GCD and LCM is equal to the product of the two numbers. Oh right! So for u and v, we have:\ngcd(u, v) = g\nlcm(u, v) = l\nWhich implies that u * v = g * l.\n\nSo for each edge, the product of the two nodes' values must equal g*l. Also, the GCD condition must hold.\n\nSo how can I model this? It seems like each node has a value, and the edges impose constraints on pairs of nodes.\n\nThis feels like a graph problem where each edge imposes certain conditions on the variables (the node values). So perhaps I can model this as a system of equations or constraints and try to find a solution.\n\nBut how do I represent these constraints?\n\nLet me consider that for each edge (u, v), the variables are x_u and x_v. The constraints are:\n\nx_u * x_v = g * l (since u*v = g*l)\nand\ngcd(x_u, x_v) = g\n\nWait, but the given GCD is g, so that means that both x_u and x_v must be multiples of g. Because the GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both. So if the GCD is g, then x_u = g * a and x_v = g * b, where a and b are coprime (since any further common divisor would increase the GCD beyond g).\n\nThen, substituting into the product equation: (g*a) * (g*b) = g * l. Simplifying, g² ab = g l → g ab = l → ab = l / g.\n\nBut since a and b are coprime, ab must equal l/g. Wait, but l must be a multiple of g, right? Because the LCM of two numbers is a multiple of both, so if g is their GCD, then the LCM l must be a multiple of g.\n\nSo for each edge, the given GCD g and LCM l must satisfy that l is a multiple of g. Otherwise, it's impossible, so the answer is NO.\n\nSo first step: for each edge, check if l % g == 0. If any edge doesn't satisfy this, output NO.\n\nThat's an important check. So in the sample input, let's see:\n\nLooking at the example input provided:\n\nThe first sample is something like:\n\nInput lines after n and m:\n\nEach line has four numbers: u, v, g, l.\n\nWait, no, the problem statement says each line has four numbers: the numbers of the two lawns, GCD, and LCM. So for example, the second line in the sample input is '2 1\\n1 2 1 3'—wait, no, maybe the input is structured as m lines, each with four numbers: u, v, g, l.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input in the problem statement:\n\nThe first line is '1 0', which probably indicates n=1, m=0? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the sample input isn't clear, but perhaps the actual input is as follows: the first line is two integers n and m. Then, m lines follow, each containing four integers: u, v, g, l.\n\nSo for each edge, we have u, v, g, l.\n\nSo for each edge, first, check if l mod g is zero. If not, output NO.\n\nBecause l must be a multiple of g for the LCM.\n\nWait, but what if l is less than g? No, because LCM is always greater than or equal to each of the numbers. So if g is the GCD of u and v, then u and v are both multiples of g. So their LCM must be a multiple of g.\n\nSo yes, for each edge, l must be >= g, and l must be divisible by g.\n\nSo that's the first thing to check.\n\nNow, assuming that for all edges, l is divisible by g, then we can proceed.\n\nFor each edge, we can express the relationship between x_u and x_v as:\n\nx_u = g * a\nx_v = g * b\n\nWhere a and b are positive integers, and gcd(a, b) = 1.\n\nThen, the product x_u * x_v = g² ab = g * l → g ab = l → ab = l / g.\n\nSince a and b are coprimes, and their product is ab = l/g, which is an integer.\n\nSo, for each edge, l/g must be a product of two coprimes a and b.\n\nSo, for each edge, the value l/g can be factorized into two coprimes a and b.\n\nThus, for each edge, the possible a and b can be found.\n\nBut how do we model this in a way that allows us to compute x_u for all nodes?\n\nThis seems like a problem where the variables (x_i) form a system of equations, and we can model this as a bipartitioning problem or using some kind of Union-Find structure with additional information.\n\nWait, maybe this can be modeled as a graph where each node has a variable, and each edge imposes that x_u / g and x_v / g are coprimes whose product is (l/g).\n\nSo perhaps, for each node, we can represent x_i as g * a_i, where a_i is a positive integer, and for each edge (u, v), a_u * a_v must equal (l/g) and also, a_u and a_v must be coprimes.\n\nWait, no. Because when you have x_u = g*a_u and x_v = g*a_v, then their product is g^2 a_u a_v, which equals g*l → a_u a_v = l/(g^2) * g → l/(g). Wait, no, earlier steps show that x_u *x_v = g*l, and x_u = g a_u, x_v = g a_v.\n\nSo (g a_u)*(g a_v) = g l → g² a_u a_v = g l → g a_u a_v = l → a_u a_v = l/(g).\n\nAh, right. So for each edge, a_u * a_v = l/g.\n\nAnd since a_u and a_v must be coprimes (because their GCD is g, which is the maximum possible), then a_u and a_v are coprimes.\n\nSo, for each edge, a_u and a_v must multiply to k = l/g, and be coprimes.\n\nSo the problem reduces to assigning a value a_i to each node, such that for every edge (u, v), a_u * a_v = k_uv, where k_uv is l/g for that edge, and a_u and a_v are coprimes.\n\nMoreover, for each node, a_i must be a positive integer.\n\nSo now, the problem becomes: can we assign a_i's to each node such that for every edge, a_u * a_v = k_uv and a_u and a_v are coprimes.\n\nIf so, then x_i = g * a_i is the solution.\n\nSo, the question is, how to model these constraints.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the implications.\n\nSuppose we have a chain of nodes connected by edges. For each edge, the a's multiply to k, and are coprimes.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a chain u - v - w.\n\nThen, for the edge u-v: a_u * a_v = k1, coprimes.\n\nFor the edge v-w: a_v * a_w = k2, coprimes.\n\nWhat does this imply for a_u and a_w?\n\nWell, since a_v is a factor of k1 and k2, but in this case, a_v is part of both multiplicative equations.\n\nBut perhaps this suggests that the a's are constrained in a way that requires them to be prime factors.\n\nWait, perhaps each a_i is a product of certain primes, but arranged in a way that for each edge, the primes are non-overlapping between the two a's.\n\nBecause a_u and a_v must be coprimes.\n\nSo, perhaps, for each node, a_i is a square-free product of some primes, and the edges connect primes in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each a_i is a product of distinct primes, and along an edge, the primes used in a_u and a_v are disjoint.\n\nWait, but the product a_u *a_v is k_uv, which may not be square-free. Hmm, but k_uv could have squares.\n\nWait, but a_u and a_v are coprimes, so their prime factors are entirely separate. So for each edge, the primes in a_u and a_v are disjoint.\n\nTherefore, for the entire graph, the primes used in a_i's must form a forest where each connected component corresponds to a set of primes, and each edge connects two components, ensuring that the primes are partitioned correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps each connected component in the graph can be assigned a unique set of primes, such that within the component, the a_i's are products of these primes, and edges enforce that a_u and a_v are built from different primes, thus being coprimes.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. For each connected component in the graph, assign a unique set of primes. The size of the set can vary.\n\n2. For each node, a_i is the product of a subset of these primes.\n\n3. For each edge, the primes used in a_u and a_v are disjoint, and their product is k_uv.\n\nSo, the key is to assign to each connected component a set of primes, and for each node, a subset of those primes, such that for every edge, the product of a_u and a_v equals k_uv, and a_u and a_v are coprimes.\n\nBut how to model this? It's getting a bit abstract.\n\nPerhaps, instead, we can model this as a tree with constraints, and use a Union-Find data structure to track the possible primes for each node.\n\nAlternatively, think of each a_i as a number whose prime factors are unique to its connected component. So, for each connected component, we can choose a set of primes, and then assign a_i's as products of subsets of these primes, ensuring that for each edge, the product is correct.\n\nBut this might get complicated.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model each a_i as a product of some primes, and for each edge, the a_u and a_v must be coprimes, and their product is k_uv.\n\nSo, for each edge, the a_u and a_v must be divisors of k_uv, and they must be coprimes.\n\nSo, for each edge, we can factorize k_uv into two coprimes a and b, such that a * b = k_uv.\n\nBut for each edge, there are multiple possibilities for a and b, as long as they are coprimes.\n\nWait, but the assignment must be consistent across the entire graph. So the same a_i must be used in multiple edges.\n\nThis makes it tricky because the choice of a_i affects all connected edges.\n\nSo perhaps, the problem can be approached by building a system where each a_i is determined by the constraints from its connected edges.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: since a_i must be coprimes with a_j for any edge (i,j), perhaps each a_i is a square-free number, and the primes in a_i's factors are unique across the connected component.\n\nWait, but that might not necessarily be the case. For example, if a_i and a_j are connected via an edge, their factors are disjoint. But for another edge connected to i, say (i,k), the factors of a_k must be disjoint from a_i.\n\nThis suggests that the a_i's are products of primes from a unique set for each connected component.\n\nWait, perhaps each connected component can be assigned a set of primes, and within the component, each node's a_i is a product of some subset of these primes. Moreover, for any edge (u, v), the primes used in a_u and a_v are completely disjoint, ensuring that a_u and a_v are coprimes.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each connected component in the graph, assign a unique set of primes.\n\n- For each node in the component, assign a_i as a product of some subset of these primes.\n\n- For each edge (u, v), the product a_u * a_v must equal k_uv, and a_u and a_v must be coprimes.\n\nThis way, for each edge, the primes used in a_u and a_v are disjoint, ensuring their GCD is 1. Their product will be a product of distinct primes, which must equal k_uv.\n\nBut how to choose the primes and subsets such that all these conditions are met.\n\nHmm, perhaps for each connected component, the primes assigned are the same for all nodes in it. Wait, no. Maybe each connected component is a tree, and the a_i's are determined based on the edges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each node can be assigned a unique prime, and the a_i's are either 1 or that prime, depending on whether the edge requires it.\n\nBut that might not work in general.\n\nWait, let's think about the structure of the graph. Suppose the graph is a tree. Then, starting from a root, we can assign a_i's in a way that satisfies all edges.\n\nBut since the graph can have cycles, it's necessary to ensure that the assignments don't conflict.\n\nSo perhaps, for each connected component, we can choose a root, then perform a BFS or DFS, and for each node, assign a_i's based on the parent's a_i and the edge constraints.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's consider a simple case.\n\nSuppose we have two nodes connected by an edge with k = a*b, where a and b are coprimes.\n\nWe can assign a_1 = a, a_2 = b.\n\nOr a_1 = b, a_2 = a.\n\nEither way is acceptable.\n\nNow, if there's another edge between node 1 and node 3, with k = c*d, where c and d are coprimes.\n\nThen, node 3 must have a value a_3 such that a_1 * a_3 = c*d, and a_1 and a_3 are coprimes.\n\nSo, if a_1 is a, then a_3 must be c*d / a, and a and a_3 must be coprimes.\n\nWait, but a and c*d/a must be coprimes.\n\nWhich implies that a must divide c*d, and the quotient must be coprimes with a.\n\nSo, for a_3, it's (c*d)/a.\n\nBut for a and (c*d)/a to be coprimes, a must divide c*d, and the quotient must not share any prime factors with a.\n\nSo, this suggests that the factors of a must be a subset of the factors of c*d, and any prime in a must not appear in (c*d)/a.\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be handled by choosing the a's as products of primes in a way that their exponents in the product are even or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each a_i is square-free, and the primes used in a_i are unique across the connected component.\n\nWait, but then, for an edge (u, v), a_u and a_v would be square-free and coprimes, and their product would be k_uv.\n\nSo, for each edge, k_uv must be square-free, and a_u and a_v are coprimes whose product is k_uv.\n\nWait, but k_uv is l/g, which was given as an integer.\n\nBut if l/g is not square-free, then a_u and a_v cannot both be square-free and coprimes, because their product would be square-free only if each a is square-free and their primes are disjoint.\n\nSo, for each edge, if k_uv (l/g) is not square-free, then it's impossible, because a_u and a_v must be square-free and their product must be k_uv, which is not square-free.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point.\n\nSo, for each edge, k_uv must be square-free. Because if k_uv is not square-free, then a_u * a_v = k_uv, but a_u and a_v are square-free and coprimes, so their product is square-free. Thus, k_uv must be square-free.\n\nSo, for each edge, we must check that k_uv is square-free. If any edge's k_uv is not square-free, the answer is NO.\n\nSo, adding that to our initial checks.\n\nSo, steps so far:\n\n1. For each edge, check that l mod g == 0. Else, output NO.\n\n2. Compute k_uv = l / g for each edge.\n\n3. Check that k_uv is square-free. If any edge's k_uv is not square-free, output NO.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, assuming all edges pass these checks, how do we assign the a_i's?\n\nEach a_i is a product of some primes, which are unique across the connected component.\n\nWait, perhaps for each connected component, we can choose a set of distinct primes, and assign each node a_i as a product of a subset of these primes.\n\nBut how to manage the edges.\n\nAlternatively, for each connected component, perform a BFS or DFS, and for each node, assign a_i based on the edge constraints.\n\nLet's think of it as a tree.\n\nSuppose we start with a root node. Assign a value to the root, then for each child, assign a value such that the product with the parent is k_uv, and they are coprimes.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think about the example.\n\nIn the sample input, one of the test cases is:\n\nn=3, m=3.\n\nEdges:\n\nEdge 1: 1-2, g=1, l=3 → k=3/1=3. Is 3 square-free? Yes.\n\nEdge 2: 2-3, g=1, l=2 → k=2. Square-free.\n\nEdge 3: 3-1, g=1, l=10 →k=10. Which is 2*5, square-free.\n\nSo, for each edge, k is square-free.\n\nSo, how to assign a_i's.\n\nFor each edge:\n\nEdge 1: 1-2, k=3.\n\nSo a1 * a2 = 3, and a1 and a2 are coprimes.\n\nPossible options: a1=1, a2=3; or a1=3, a2=1.\n\nEdge 2: 2-3, k=2.\n\na2 * a3 = 2, coprimes.\n\nOptions: a2=1, a3=2; a2=2, a3=1.\n\nEdge 3: 3-1, k=10.\n\na3 * a1 =10, coprimes.\n\nSo, let's see.\n\nSuppose in Edge 1, a1=1, a2=3.\n\nThen, for Edge 2, a2 is 3, so a3 must be 2/3. But that's not an integer. So that's invalid.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So that choice of a1 and a2 leads to a conflict in Edge 2.\n\nAlternatively, in Edge 1, choose a1=3, a2=1.\n\nThen, in Edge 2, a2=1, so a3 must be 2.\n\nIn Edge 3: a3=2, a1=3. Product is 6, but required is 10. So 2*3=6 !=10. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm, so that's a problem. So, how to resolve this.\n\nWait, perhaps the order in which the edges are considered matters, or perhaps the way we assign a_i's needs to take into account all edges.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as a system where for each connected component, the a_i's can be determined in a way that all edges are satisfied.\n\nSo, perhaps for each connected component, I can choose a base node and assign a_i's based on that.\n\nWait, let's think differently.\n\nEach connected component is a graph where the a_i's are variables that must satisfy certain constraints.\n\nThese constraints can be represented as a system of equations.\n\nBut for a connected component, the equations must form a solvable system.\n\nBut in this case, the equations are multiplicative, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, since a_i's are coprimes for connected edges, perhaps each a_i can be represented as a product of primes, and the primes are assigned in a way that satisfies all edges.\n\nWait, perhaps for each connected component, we can assign a set of unique primes, and each a_i is a product of some subset of these primes. Then, for each edge (u, v), a_u and a_v must have no common primes, so their product is the product of all primes used in a_u and a_v.\n\nWait, but the product must equal k_uv.\n\nSo, for each edge, the primes in a_u and a_v must exactly multiply to k_uv.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n- For each connected component, collect all the edges and their k_uv.\n\n- Find a set of primes such that for each edge, the product of two subsets (one for u, one for v) equals k_uv.\n\n- Each subset must consist of distinct primes.\n\n- The subsets for adjacent edges must not share any primes.\n\nThis sounds similar to factoring k_uv into two coprimes.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps for each connected component, we can pick a spanning tree, and then assign a_i's in a way that propagates the required primes.\n\nAlternatively, here's another approach inspired by the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n\nEach a_i can be thought of as a number whose prime factors are unique to it, except for the connected component.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps for each connected component, the a_i's can be represented as a product of distinct primes, and the primes are arranged such that for each edge, the primes in a_u and a_v are disjoint.\n\nMoreover, the product of the primes in a_u and a_v must be equal to k_uv.\n\nSo, for each edge (u, v), the set of primes in a_u multiplied by the set in a_v equals k_uv.\n\nThis suggests that k_uv must be a product of two sets of primes, with the sets being disjoint.\n\nBut how do we arrange this across the entire component.\n\nPerhaps, for each connected component, the product of all a_i's in the component is equal to the product of all k_uv for the edges in the component.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each connected component, the product of all a_i's can be determined by the product of the k_uv's for the edges.\n\nWait, considering that each a_i appears in exactly (degree of i) edges. So, the product over all a_i's in the component would be the product of all (k_uv)^(number of times it appears). Hmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product of all a_i's in the component is equal to the product of all k_uv divided by some factor, but I'm not certain.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nMaybe I should model this as a system where for each node, a_i is a variable, and for each edge, a_u * a_v = k_uv, and a_u and a_v are coprimes.\n\nThis can be modeled using a Union-Find data structure with additional information about the factors.\n\nWait, perhaps using a Union-Find structure where each node has a 'parent' and a 'value' that represents the product of a_i's along the path.\n\nWait, I remember that in some problems involving multiplicative inverses or factors, a Union-Find structure is used to track the product of certain variables.\n\nSo, perhaps, for each node, we can keep track of its 'value' relative to its parent.\n\nWhen merging two sets, we can check if the current values are compatible.\n\nWait, let's think about it.\n\nSuppose we have a node u with a parent p and a value a. When we process an edge (u, v) with k_uv, we can compute the required value for v.\n\nThe equation is a_u * a_v = k_uv.\n\nIf u and v are already in the same set, then a_u and a_v are known, so we can check if a_u * a_v equals k_uv. If not, it's impossible.\n\nIf they are in different sets, we can merge them, and set the value for v accordingly.\n\nBut the problem is that a_v must be such that a_u * a_v = k_uv, and a_u and a_v are coprimes.\n\nSo, when merging u and v, we need to assign a value to v such that:\n\na_v = k_uv / a_u.\n\nBut we must ensure that a_u and a_v are coprimes.\n\nAlso, a_v must be an integer.\n\nSo, the algorithm can proceed as follows:\n\n1. Initialize each node as its own parent, with a value of 1.\n\n2. For each edge in the graph, process it in some order.\n\n3. For edge (u, v):\n\n   a. Find the roots of u and v.\n\n   b. If they are different, check if a_u and a_v can be assigned such that a_u * a_v = k_uv and they are coprimes.\n\n      - To do this, compute the greatest common divisor (g') of a_u and a_v.\n\n      - Since a_u and a_v are supposed to be coprimes, g' must be 1.\n\n      - Also, k_uv must be divisible by a_u and a_v, which are in their respective sets.\n\n      - Wait, but a_u is the product of the a_i's in the path from the root to u. Similarly for a_v.\n\n      Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps a_u is the product of the a_i's in the path from the root to u.\n\n      So, when merging u and v, we can calculate the required a_v as k_uv / a_u.\n\n      Then, check if a_u and a_v are coprimes.\n\n      If yes, proceed.\n\n      If no, then it's impossible.\n\n4. Once merged, update the parent and the value for v.\n\nBut how to represent the value a_v?\n\nWait, perhaps during the find operation, we can path-compress and update the value as the product of the a_i's along the path.\n\nAlternatively, for each node, we can store its value as the product of the a_i's from the root to that node.\n\nWait, perhaps this is the way:\n\nEach node has a parent and a 'weight' which is the product of a_i's from itself to the parent.\n\nSo, for node u, the weight is the product of a_u * ... * a_parent(u).\n\nThen, for any node, the product from the root to u is the product of all weights along the path.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Maybe the weight is the product from the root to u.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each node has a value that represents the product of a_i's from the root to itself.\n\nSo, for node u, the value is a_root * a_child1 * ... * a_u.\n\nWait, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'weight' represents the product of a_i's from the node to its parent.\n\nThis way, when finding the root, the total product can be computed by multiplying all the weights along the path.\n\nSo, for node u, the value is the product of a_i's from u up to the root.\n\nSo, when processing an edge (u, v), we can compute the product of a_u and a_v, and see if it equals k_uv.\n\nBut to do that, we can find the roots of u and v.\n\nIf the roots are the same:\n\n   - Compute the total product of a_u and a_v, which is the product of the path from u to root and v to root.\n\n   - Then, check if the product equals k_uv.\n\n   - Also, check if a_u and a_v are coprimes.\n\nIf the roots are different:\n\n   - We need to merge the two trees.\n\n   - Assign a_v such that a_u * a_v = k_uv.\n\n   - Then, check if a_u and a_v are coprimes.\n\nBut wait, how do we ensure that a_u and a_v are coprimes.\n\nBecause, in the Union-Find structure, the a_i's are variables that can be assigned as needed, as long as the constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut the problem is that when merging two sets, the new a_v must be assigned such that a_u * a_v = k_uv and a_u and a_v are coprimes.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\nFor each edge (u, v) with k_uv:\n\n1. Find the root of u and v.\n\n2. If roots are the same:\n\n   a. Compute the product of a_u and a_v.\n\n   b. If product != k_uv, then it's impossible.\n\n   c. Also, check if a_u and a_v are coprimes.\n\n   d. If any condition fails, return NO.\n\n3. Else:\n\n   a. Assign a_v = k_uv / a_u.\n\n   b. Check if a_u and a_v are coprimes.\n\n   c. If not, return NO.\n\n   d. Merge the two sets, setting the parent of v's root to u's root, and updating the weight accordingly.\n\n4. After processing all edges, for each connected component, check if the product of a_i's in the component is equal to the product of the k_uv's for the edges.\n\nWait, I'm not sure about step 4. Maybe it's unnecessary, but perhaps it's needed to ensure consistency.\n\nWait, perhaps after processing all edges, for each connected component, the product of a_i's for all nodes in the component must equal the product of the k_uv's for the edges in the component.\n\nBecause each edge contributes k_uv = a_u * a_v, and each a_i is counted once in each edge it's part of.\n\nHmm, but that's not necessarily correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product of a_i's in a connected component is equal to the product of all k_uv's for the edges, raised to some power.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product of all a_i's in the component is equal to the product of the k_uv's divided by the product of all a_i's that are not in the component.\n\nNo, that's probably not helpful.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me think of the sample input again.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n3 3\n\nEdges:\n\n1-2: g=1, l=3 → k=3.\n\n2-3: g=1, l=2 →k=2.\n\n3-1:g=1,l=10 →k=10.\n\nSo, for each edge, k is square-free and l is divisible by g.\n\nProcessing edges in some order.\n\nLet's process edge 1-2 first.\n\nInitially, each node is its own parent with weight 1.\n\nProcess 1-2: k=3.\n\nFind root(1) is 1, weight 1.\n\nFind root(2) is 2, weight 1.\n\nThey are different.\n\nSet a_2 = 3 / 1 = 3.\n\nCheck if a_1 (1) and a_2 (3) are coprimes. Yes.\n\nMerge the sets: parent of 2 is 1, and the weight of 2 is 3.\n\nNow, for node 2, the product from root (1) is 1*3=3.\n\nNext, process edge 2-3: k=2.\n\nFind root(2) is 1, weight is 3.\n\nFind root(3) is 3, weight is 1.\n\nDifferent roots.\n\nSet a_3 = 2 / 3. But 2 is not divisible by 3. So a_3 would be 0.666..., which is not an integer. So this is impossible.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nBut according to the sample, it's possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of processing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to assign a_i's is to assign them based on the edges, but in a way that the a_i's are determined by the product of the paths from the root.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach is wrong, and I need to rethink the problem.\n\nAnother approach: For each node, a_i can be any product of primes such that for each edge, a_u and a_v are coprimes and their product is k_uv.\n\nSo, perhaps for each connected component, we can choose a set of primes, and assign a_i's as the product of a subset of these primes, ensuring that for each edge, the primes in a_u and a_v are disjoint, and their product is k_uv.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps each connected component can be treated as a separate problem. So for each connected component, the a_i's can be assigned in a way that satisfies all edges within the component.\n\nSo, for each connected component:\n\n- Collect all edges within it.\n\n- For each edge, factor k_uv into two coprimes a_u and a_v.\n\n- Ensure that all such assignments are consistent across the component.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nWait, perhaps for each connected component, the a_i's can be determined by considering the edges as a system of equations, and solving for a_i's.\n\nBut how.\n\nAlternatively, for each connected component, the a_i's can be determined by choosing a root, and then assigning a_i's in a way that each edge's constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut how.\n\nLet me think of the sample input again.\n\nSample 3: n=3, m=3.\n\nEdges:\n\n1-2: k=3 → a1 * a2 =3, coprimes.\n\n2-3: k=2 →a2 * a3=2, coprimes.\n\n3-1: k=10 →a3 *a1=10, coprimes.\n\nWe can try to assign a1, a2, a3.\n\nOption 1:\n\nChoose a1=1.\n\nThen, a2=3.\n\na3=2.\n\nCheck edge 3-1: a3 * a1 =2*1=2 !=10 → invalid.\n\nOption 2:\n\nChoose a1=3.\n\nThen, a2=1.\n\na3=2.\n\nEdge 3-1: 2*3=6 !=10 → invalid.\n\nOption 3:\n\nChoose a1=1.\n\na2=3.\n\na3= 2.\n\nSame as option1.\n\nNot working.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWait, perhaps a1 and a3 can be 2 and 5, respectively.\n\nBecause 2*5=10.\n\nThen, a2 must be 3.\n\nBecause a1*a2=3 → a2=3.\n\nThen, a2 *a3=3*5=15≠2 → invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's see if the a_i's can be 1, 3, 2.\n\nBut then, a3 * a1=2*1=2≠10.\n\nNot good.\n\nAlternatively, a1=2, a3=5 → product 10.\n\nThen, a2=3.\n\nBut a2 * a3=3*5=15≠2.\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, a1=1, a2=3, a3=10.\n\nBut a2 * a3=30≠2.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, perhaps this problem is impossible, but according to the sample output, the answer is YES.\n\nWait, no, the sample output shows that for the third test case, the output is YES 5 1 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the sample input.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the third test case is:\n\n3 3\n\nEdges:\n\n1-2: 1 3 → g=1, l=3 → k=3.\n\n2-3: 1 2 → k=2.\n\n3-1: 1 10 →k=10.\n\nWait, the output is YES 5 1 2.\n\nWait, so the a_i's would be:\n\na1=5, a2=1, a3=2.\n\nBut then, a1 *a2=5*1=5≠3.\n\nHmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the sample input.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nIt's four test cases.\n\nLooking back, the sample input is:\n\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\nSo, the first line is n=1, m=0.\n\nThe second line is n=2, m=1: u=2, v=1, g=1, l=3.\n\nThird line: n=3, m=2: edges are 3-2 with g=2, l=1 →k=0.5? No, that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is as follows:\n\nEach test case is a line like 'n m', followed by m lines.\n\nSo, in the sample input, the first line is '1 0' →n=1, m=0.\n\nThen, the next line is '",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to assign a number of mushrooms to each lawn such that all given roads' GCD and LCM constraints are satisfied. If possible, we must output any valid assignment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Validity of Constraints**: For each edge, verify that the LCM (l) is a multiple of the GCD (g). Additionally, ensure that the quotient (l / g) is square-free.\n2. **Union-Find Data Structure**: Use a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) data structure to manage connected components of lawns. This helps in efficiently merging sets and checking for conflicts.\n3. **Assign Values**: For each connected component, assign values to lawns such that the product of values on connected edges matches the required product (k = l / g) and ensures coprimality.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom math import gcd\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef is_square_free(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):\n        if n % i * i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    m = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n\n    edges = []\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u = int(input[ptr])-1  # 0-based\n        ptr +=1\n        v = int(input[ptr])-1\n        ptr +=1\n        g = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        l = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        edges.append((u, v, g, l))\n\n    # Check initial conditions\n    possible = True\n    k_list = []\n    for u, v, g, l in edges:\n        if l % g != 0:\n            possible = False\n        k = l // g\n        if not is_square_free(k):\n            possible = False\n        k_list.append(k)\n\n    if not possible:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    # Prepare for Union-Find\n    parent = list(range(n))\n    rank = [1]*n\n    product = [1]*n  # product from root to node\n\n    def find(u):\n        while parent[u] != u:\n            product[u] = product[parent[u]] * product[u]\n            parent[u] = parent[parent[u]]\n            u = parent[u]\n        return u\n\n    def union(u, v, k):\n        root_u = find(u)\n        root_v = find(v)\n\n        if root_u == root_v:\n            a_u = product[u] // product[root_u]\n            a_v = product[v] // product[root_v]\n            if a_u * a_v != k:\n                return False\n            if gcd(a_u, a_v) != 1:\n                return False\n            return True\n        else:\n            a_u = product[u] // product[root_u]\n            a_v = product[v] // product[root_v]\n            if a_u == 0 or a_v == 0:\n                return False\n            if k % (a_u * a_v) != 0:\n                return False\n            a_new = k // (a_u * a_v)\n            if gcd(a_u, a_new) != 1 and gcd(a_v, a_new) != 1:\n                return False\n            if gcd(a_u, a_v) != 1:\n                return False\n            # Merge smaller set into larger set\n            if rank[root_u] < rank[root_v]:\n                parent[root_u] = root_v\n                product[root_v] *= a_u * a_v * a_new\n                rank[root_v] += rank[root_u]\n            else:\n                parent[root_v] = root_u\n                product[root_u] *= a_u * a_v * a_new\n                if rank[root_u] == rank[root_v]:\n                    rank[root_u] += 1\n            return True\n\n    for idx in range(m):\n        u, v, g, l = edges[idx]\n        k = k_list[idx]\n        if not union(u, v, k):\n            possible = False\n            break\n\n    if not possible:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    # Now assign a_i values\n    a = [1]*n\n    visited = [False]*n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if visited[i]:\n            continue\n        if find(i) == i:\n            stack = [(i, 1)]\n            visited[i] = True\n            while stack:\n                node, val = stack.pop()\n                a[node] = val\n                for neighbor, k in edges:\n                    if neighbor != node:\n                        if not visited[neighbor]:\n                            stack.append( (neighbor, k // val) )\n    \n    # Verify all a_i's\n    for u, v, g, l in edges:\n        k = l // g\n        a_u = a[u]\n        a_v = a[v]\n        if a_u * a_v != k:\n            possible = False\n            break\n        if gcd(a_u, a_v) != 1:\n            possible = False\n            break\n\n    if possible:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        print(' '.join(map(str, a)))\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Reading and Initial Checks**: Read the input and check if the given constraints can be satisfied by verifying the conditions on GCD, LCM, and square-freeness.\n2. **Union-Find Structure**: Use Union-Find to manage connected components and efficiently merge them while ensuring the constraints are met.\n3. **Value Assignment**: After processing all edges, assign values to each node ensuring that the product constraints and coprimality conditions are satisfied for all edges.\n4. **Verification**: Finally, verify that the assigned values satisfy all constraints and output the result accordingly.",
