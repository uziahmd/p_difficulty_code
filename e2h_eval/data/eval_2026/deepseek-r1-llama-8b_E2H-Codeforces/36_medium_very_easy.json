The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about radio towers in towns. There are n+2 towns, numbered from 0 to n+1. We build a tower in each town 1 to n with probability 1/2 each, independently. Then, we assign each built tower a signal power between 1 and n. The goal is to set these powers such that:\n\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal.\n2. Each of the towns 1 to n gets exactly one signal.\n\nWe need to compute the probability of being able to do this, modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm. So the probability is the number of valid configurations divided by the total possible configurations, which is (2^n). Because each tower is built or not with probability 1/2, so 2^n possibilities.\n\nBut how to count the valid configurations?\n\nLet me think about what makes a configuration valid.\n\nEach town from 1 to n must be covered exactly once. Also, the signal can't reach 0 or n+1.\n\nSo for each built tower, its signal can only cover some range, but not touching 0 or n+1.\n\nWait, but the signal's range is |c - i| < p, meaning c is in [i-p+1, i+p-1]. But p can't be larger than n, but since the town is at i (which is up to n), the maximum possible coverage is from 1 to n.\n\nWait, for a tower at i, p can be any integer from 1 to n. The signal covers from i-p+1 to i+p-1, but since the towns are 0,1,...n+1, perhaps the actual covered towns are the intersection of this interval with the 1..n towns.\n\nBut in the problem, we need to make sure that the entire 1..n is covered exactly once.\n\nSo, the setup is similar to tiling the line segment [1, n] with intervals, each assigned to a single tower, and none of these intervals can include 0 or n+1.\n\nMoreover, each tower is either present (so contributes an interval) or not present (so doesn't contribute anything).\n\nWait, but if a tower is present, it must be assigned a p such that the interval doesn't reach 0 or n+1. So for a tower at position i, the p must satisfy that i - p + 1 >= 1 and i + p -1 <= n.\n\nWait, because if the signal reaches 0, then town 0 would get a signal, which is invalid. Similarly, if it reaches n+1, that's also invalid.\n\nSo for each tower i, the possible p's are those where:\n\ni - p + 1 >= 1 => p <= i\n\nand\n\ni + p - 1 <= n => p <= n - i + 1.\n\nSo p can be from 1 to min(i, n-i+1).\n\nWait, wait. Let me see: For a tower at i, the signal can't reach 0. So the left end is max(1, i - p + 1). But wait, no— because the condition is that |c - i| < p. So c can be as low as i - p + 1. So for the left end to be >=1, we must have i - p + 1 >=1 → p <= i.\n\nSimilarly, the right end is i + p -1 <= n → p <= n - i +1.\n\nSo p has to be at most the minimum of i and (n -i +1).\n\nSo for each i, the maximum possible p is m_i = min(i, n -i +1).\n\nIf a tower is built at i, it can contribute a certain interval of length 2p-1 (since the interval is from i-p+1 to i+p-1, inclusive, which is 2p-1 towns). But wait, wait— that's not correct. Wait, the interval is |c -i| < p, so c ranges from i-p+1 to i+p-1, inclusive. The number of towns covered is (i+p-1) - (i-p+1) + 1 = 2p-1.\n\nBut each town must be covered exactly once.\n\nSo the problem reduces to selecting a subset S of {1,2,...,n} (the built towers), and assigning to each s in S a p(s) such that:\n\n- The union of all intervals [s - p(s)+1, s + p(s)-1] for s in S is exactly {1,2,...,n}.\n- For each s in S, p(s) ≤ min(s, n -s +1).\n- The intervals do not include 0 or n+1.\n\nBut this seems complicated. How can we model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into tiling the line with certain blocks, each block corresponding to a tower's coverage.\n\nWait, each tower's coverage is an odd-length interval centered at s. So the coverage is 2p-1 towns long, starting at s - p +1 and ending at s + p -1.\n\nBut for the entire line 1..n to be covered exactly once, the sum of these intervals must form a partition of 1..n, and each interval is an odd-length interval centered at some s, and the intervals don't overlap.\n\nSo the problem is equivalent to counting the number of subsets S and assignments of p(s) such that the intervals form a partition of 1..n into non-overlapping, adjacent intervals, each of which is centered at some s in S, and each interval is of length 2p(s)-1.\n\nWait, that's an interesting perspective. Because each interval is a contiguous block, and they must not overlap. So the entire line is covered without gaps or overlaps.\n\nMoreover, each such interval must be of odd length.\n\nWait, no. Because for p(s) being any integer ≥1, the length is 2p(s)-1, which is always odd. So yes.\n\nSo the problem is to find the number of ways to partition the line 1..n into some number of non-overlapping, adjacent, intervals, each of which is centered at a point s and has length 2p-1 (for some p). Also, each such interval corresponds to a tower built at s.\n\nWait, but for each such interval, the tower must be present. Because if a tower is not present, it cannot contribute any interval.\n\nSo the subset S is exactly the set of centers of these intervals.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of ways to tile the line 1..n with intervals of odd lengths, each centered at s, and each such s must be in S. Additionally, the intervals must not extend beyond 0 or n+1.\n\nWait, but since the intervals can't reach 0 or n+1, the first interval starts at 1, and the last ends at n.\n\nWait, no— because for example, the first interval could start at 1, but if another interval starts before that, it would go beyond. Wait, no. Because the intervals are non-overlapping and must cover 1..n exactly.\n\nSo the entire tiling is a collection of intervals that together make up 1..n, with each interval of odd length, and each interval's center is s, and the interval's endpoints are s-p and s+p-1.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model this as a dynamic programming problem.\n\nLet me think: let dp[i] be the number of valid tilings for the first i towns.\n\nThen, for each position i, to compute dp[i], we can consider adding an interval that ends at i. So for each possible j where j is the start of the interval, and the interval's length is l (odd), such that j + l -1 = i.\n\nBut the interval must be centered at some s, so l must be 2p-1 for some p. So for each l, which is an odd integer ≥1, and such that j = i - l +1.\n\nWait, perhaps the transitions can be thought of as adding an interval of length l (l is odd) that ends at position i. Then, the starting position is i - l +1, which must be ≥1.\n\nSo for each i, dp[i] = sum over all possible l (odd, 1<= l <=i) of dp[i - l].\n\nBut wait, that's not considering the constraints on the centers. Because the interval of length l must be centered at s, which is the midpoint of the interval. So s = (j + i)/2, since the interval starts at j and ends at i.\n\nWait, the interval starts at j = s - p +1, and ends at i = s + p -1. So the length l = i - j +1 = 2p-1. So s is the center, and must be an integer because j and i are integers. So s must be equal to (j + i)/2, which implies that j + i is even, so i - j must be odd. Which aligns with l being odd.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So for each interval that ends at i, the length l must be odd, and the starting position j = i - l +1 must be ≥1. Additionally, s = (j + i)/2 must be an integer, which it will be since l is odd.\n\nThus, the transitions can be considered as choosing an odd l, and adding dp[i-l] to dp[i].\n\nBut wait, no. Because each such l corresponds to a particular s. So for each possible l (odd), the interval starts at j = i - l +1, and the center is s = (j + i)/2. But s must be in the set of built towers, which complicates things.\n\nWait, no. Because the subset S is exactly the centers of the intervals. So each interval must correspond to a tower being built at s. So when adding an interval ending at i, the center s must be present in S.\n\nSo the transition depends on whether s is present. Oh, but wait, the problem is that when building the DP, we are trying to count the number of valid subsets S and their p(s) assignments, but the presence of s in S is determined by whether the interval is added.\n\nHmm, perhaps the DP approach isn't directly applicable because the presence of s in S depends on whether an interval is placed there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a tiling problem where each tile is an odd-length interval, and each tile's center must be a point where a tower is built.\n\nWait, but each tile corresponds to a tower being present. So the tiling must consist of a collection of tiles (intervals) whose centers are exactly the points where towers are built, and the sum of the tile lengths is n, and they don't overlap.\n\nBut how to model this in a way that allows us to count the number of such tilings, given that each tile's center is a point that may or may not be present in the original subset S.\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe we can model the problem using generating functions or combinatorics.\n\nAnother angle: think of the problem as a graph where each node represents a town, and edges represent possible jumps of an odd length. Then, the number of valid configurations is the number of ways to jump from 0 to n, making steps of odd lengths, with each step's end being the center of a tower that is present.\n\nWait, but the towers are present with probability 1/2. So the configuration is valid if the tiling can be achieved by choosing certain centers (towers present) such that their intervals tile the entire 1..n without overlapping.\n\nBut this feels like it's going in circles.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern or recurrence relation.\n\nLooking at small examples might help.\n\nExample 1: n=1.\n\nTowns 0,1,2.\n\nWe must build a tower in town 1. Assign p=1. Then the interval is [1,1], which covers town 1, and doesn't touch 0 or 2.\n\nSo the only valid configuration is when tower 1 is built. The probability is 1/2.\n\nSo output is 1/2 mod MOD.\n\nAnother example: n=2.\n\nAs per the note, the answer is 1/4.\n\nBecause two possibilities:\n\nEither both towers 1 and 2 are built. Then assign p=1 to each, covering 1 and 2, respectively. So the intervals are [1,1] and [2,2], which is valid.\n\nOr, perhaps another possibility? Wait, no— what other options are there?\n\nWait, another possibility is that only tower 2 is built. Then assign p=2. Its interval is [2-2+1, 2+2-1] → [1,3]. But town 3 is n+1=3, so that's invalid. So p can't be 2 in that case. So for tower 2, the maximum p is min(2, n -2 +1) = min(2, 1)=1. So p can only be 1. So in this case, the interval is [2,2], leaving town 1 uncovered. So that's invalid.\n\nSo the only valid scenario is when both 1 and 2 are built, each with p=1.\n\nThus, the probability is (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4.\n\nSo the output is 748683265, which is the modular inverse of 4 mod 998244353.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother example: n=3.\n\nThe answer is 1/4.\n\nIn this case, the valid configurations are either:\n\n- All three towers built, each with p=1. Their intervals are [1,1], [2,2], [3,3]. This is valid.\n\n- Or, only tower 2 is built, with p=2. Its interval is [1,3], which covers all towns except 0 and 4 (but n=3, so 3 is included, and 4 is beyond). So the interval is [1,3], which is exactly all towns. So this is also valid.\n\nSo in this case, there are two valid configurations:\n\nCase 1: all three towers built. Probability is (1/2)^3 = 1/8.\n\nCase 2: only tower 2 built. Probability is (1/2).\n\nSo total probability is 1/8 + 1/2 = 5/8? Wait, no. Wait, no— the note says the real answer is 1/4.\n\nWait, the note says for n=3, the answer is 1/4. So my reasoning is wrong. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem statement.\n\nWait, the note says that for n=3, the answer is 1/4. It says that with probability 1/8, the towers are built in 1,2,3, and you can set p=1 for all. With probability 1/8, only tower 2 is built, and p=2. So total probability is 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4.\n\nAh, right. So in the second case, the assignment is possible because the interval [1,3] is allowed, and since it covers all the towns, that's a valid configuration.\n\nSo the total is 2 cases: when all three are built, and when only 2 is built.\n\nEach of these has a probability of (1/2)^3 = 1/8 and (1/2) = 1/2? Wait no, wait:\n\nWait, for case 1: all three towers are built. The probability is (1/2)^3 = 1/8.\n\nFor case 2: only tower 2 is built. The probability is 1/2.\n\nSo the total is 1/8 + 1/2 = 5/8. But the note says the answer is 1/4.\n\nWait, something's wrong here. What's the correct reasoning?\n\nWait, the note says for n=3, the answer is 1/4. So perhaps my initial analysis was incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the assignment of p is required to have the intervals not overlapping, and each interval must be exactly the coverage of a single tower.\n\nWait, in the case where only tower 2 is built, and p=2. The interval is [1,3], which covers towns 1,2,3. So that's a single interval. So that's valid.\n\nBut in this case, the subset S is just {2}, and the assignment is p=2.\n\nSo the number of valid configurations is 2: S={1,2,3} with p=1 for all, and S={2} with p=2.\n\nSo the total number of valid subsets is 2.\n\nThe total possible subsets is 2^3 =8.\n\nSo probability is 2/8 = 1/4. That's why the answer is 1/4.\n\nAh, I see. So the number of valid configurations is the number of tilings as per the problem's constraints, not the probability of the subsets.\n\nSo, for each valid tiling, we need to count whether the subset S is built and whether the assignment of p is possible.\n\nBut the key point is that for a tiling to be valid, each interval must correspond to a tower built at s, and the assignment of p is such that p is within the allowed range for s.\n\nWait, but the assignment of p is determined by the interval. Because for each interval of length l=2p-1, p must be chosen such that l is the correct length.\n\nWait, no. Because for a given interval of length l, p can be any value such that l=2p-1. So p is uniquely determined as (l+1)/2.\n\nSo, for each interval, l must be odd, and p is fixed as (l+1)/2.\n\nBut for s to be present in S, because the interval is centered at s.\n\nSo for each interval, the center s must have been built.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to counting the number of tilings of 1..n into non-overlapping, adjacent intervals of odd lengths, such that for each interval, the center s is present in the subset S.\n\nWait, but S is the set of centers of the intervals. So the presence of s is exactly whether the interval is present.\n\nWait, no. Because S is the set of built towers, which is the same as the centers of the intervals.\n\nSo, for each interval in the tiling, the center s must be present in S.\n\nBut in the tiling, each interval is centered at some s, and s must be a built tower.\n\nSo, the number of valid tilings is exactly the number of ways to tile 1..n with intervals of odd lengths, each centered at a tower that is built.\n\nWait, but each such tiling corresponds to exactly one subset S and one assignment of p.\n\nSo the number of valid configurations is equal to the number of such tilings.\n\nBut the problem is to find the number of such tilings, and then divide by 2^n to get the probability.\n\nSo the question is now: how many ways can we tile 1..n into non-overlapping intervals of odd lengths, each centered at a unique position.\n\nWait, but each interval's length is 2p-1, which is determined by p. So each interval's length is fixed once p is chosen. But in our problem, the p is chosen after building the towers, but in the tiling approach, the p is determined by the interval length.\n\nWait, perhaps the tiling approach is correct, but the way to model it is to think that each interval is of odd length, and the centers are in S.\n\nSo the number of valid tilings is the same as the number of ways to select a subset S and assign intervals to each s in S such that the intervals tile 1..n, and for each s in S, the interval around s is of length 2p(s)-1, which is determined by p(s).\n\nWait, but p(s) can vary, but for a given interval, p(s) must be chosen such that the interval doesn't reach 0 or n+1.\n\nWait, but in the tiling approach, each interval is of length l=2p(s)-1, and the p(s) is determined by the interval.\n\nSo the problem is equivalent to tiling 1..n with intervals of odd lengths, where the start and end of each interval are such that the center s is within 1..n, and the interval doesn't reach 0 or n+1.\n\nWait, but perhaps this is getting too abstract. Let's think of the tiling as a binary string, where each interval is represented as a '1' and the rest as '0's, but that might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of valid tilings is equal to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nWait, for n=1: 1 tiling.\n\nn=2: Only one tiling ([1,1], [2,2]).\n\nn=3: Two tilings ([1,1], [2,2], [3,3]) and ([1,3]).\n\nWait, no. Wait, [1,3] is a single interval of length 3, which is 2*2-1=3. So p=2.\n\nYes, so for n=3, there are two tilings.\n\nHmm, the counts seem to follow the Fibonacci sequence. Let me see:\n\nn=1: 1.\n\nn=2: 1.\n\nn=3: 2.\n\nn=4: ?\n\nLet's compute for n=4.\n\nPossible tilings:\n\n1. Four single intervals: [1,1], [2,2], [3,3], [4,4].\n\n2. One interval of length 3: [2,4], centered at 3. Then [1,1].\n\n3. Another option: [1,3], then [4,4].\n\n4. Or, [1,3], [4,4].\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the count follows the Fibonacci numbers shifted by one.\n\nWait, for n=1: 1.\n\nn=2: 1.\n\nn=3: 2.\n\nn=4: 3.\n\nn=5: 5.\n\nSo the counts are the Fibonacci numbers, starting from Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, etc.\n\nSo the number of tilings f(n) is equal to Fib(n), where Fib is the standard Fibonacci sequence.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nIf so, then the number of valid configurations is Fib(n), and the probability is Fib(n) / 2^n.\n\nWait, but for n=3, Fib(3) is 2. So 2/8=1/4, which matches the note.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, Fib(2)=1, 1/4=0.25.\n\nYes, that seems to fit.\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing Fib(n) / 2^n mod 998244353.\n\nBut wait, what about n=4?\n\nIf f(4) is 3, then 3/(2^4) = 3/16.\n\nBut I'm not sure if f(4) is indeed 3. Let's think:\n\nFor n=4, the possible tilings are:\n\n1. [1,1], [2,2], [3,3], [4,4]. → 1 way.\n\n2. [1,3], [4,4]. → 1 way.\n\n3. [1,1], [2,2], [3,3], [4,4] is another way, but perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some.\n\nWait, another tiling could be [1,3], [4,4]. Or [2,4], [1,1]. Or [2,4], [1,1], but that's the same as the previous.\n\nWait, no. Wait, [2,4] is an interval of length 3, centered at 3. Then [1,1]. So that's another tiling.\n\nSo for n=4, we have:\n\n1. Four single intervals.\n\n2. [1,3] and [4,4].\n\n3. [2,4] and [1,1].\n\n4. [1,1], [2,2], [3,3], [4,4] → same as 1.\n\nWait, no— that's the same as 1. So for n=4, the count is 3? Or perhaps more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct count for n=4 is 3.\n\nThen, f(n) = Fib(n).\n\nFib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5.\n\nSo yes, it's matching.\n\nThus, the number of valid tilings is Fib(n).\n\nSo the probability is Fib(n) / 2^n.\n\nThus, the solution is to compute Fib(n) multiplied by the modular inverse of 2^n modulo 998244353.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the Fibonacci numbers up to n=2e5.\n\n2. Compute 2^n mod MOD.\n\n3. Compute inv_2n = pow(2, n, MOD)'s inverse mod MOD.\n\n4.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that we can set the signal powers of radio towers such that each town from 1 to n is covered exactly once, while towns 0 and n+1 are not covered. This probability should be computed modulo 998244353.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be approached by recognizing that the number of valid configurations follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, the number of valid ways to tile the towns from 1 to n using intervals of odd lengths corresponds to the nth Fibonacci number.\n\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The number of valid configurations for a given n is given by the nth Fibonacci number. This is because each valid configuration can be seen as a tiling problem where each interval is of odd length.\n2. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result must be taken modulo 998244353, we use modular arithmetic to compute large numbers efficiently.\n3. **Probability Calculation**: The probability is the ratio of the number of valid configurations (Fibonacci number) to the total number of possible configurations (2^n). Using Fermat's Little Theorem, we compute the modular inverse of 2^n to find this ratio efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Compute Fibonacci(n)\n    fib = [0] * (n + 2)\n    fib[1] = 1\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        fib[i] = (fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]) % MOD\n    \n    pow_2n = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    \n    # Compute inverse of pow_2n modulo MOD using Fermat's little theorem\n    inv_pow_2n = pow(pow_2n, MOD - 2, MOD)\n    \n    ans = (fib[n] * inv_pow_2n) % MOD\n    print(ans)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fibonacci Calculation**: We precompute the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term using dynamic programming. This allows us to efficiently determine the number of valid configurations.\n2. **Modular Exponentiation**: We compute 2^n modulo 998244353 to handle large powers efficiently.\n3. **Modular Inverse**: Using Fermat's Little Theorem, we compute the modular inverse of 2^n to convert the fraction into its modular form.\n4. **Final Result**: Multiply the Fibonacci number by the modular inverse of 2^n and take the result modulo 998244353 to get the final answer.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle the constraints and compute the result within the required time limits.",
