    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I calculate the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. Let's see what the problem says.\n\nThe plate is w rows by h columns. We have k rings to gild. Each ring is a border around an inner rectangle that's getting smaller each time. The first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away from the edge, and so on. Each ring is one cell wide.\n\nHmm, I remember that for a rectangle, the perimeter is 2*(width + height) - 4. Because when you add the four corners, you'd be double-counting them, so subtracting 4. So for each ring, I can compute the perimeter and add it to the total.\n\nWait, but how does each ring's size change? For the i-th ring, the width becomes w - 4*(i-1), right? And similarly for height. But wait, no. Wait, the i-th ring is the i-th border inside. So for i=1, it's the outermost border. For i=2, it's the next ring, which is two cells in from the edge. So each subsequent ring reduces both the width and height by 2*(i-1). Or wait, maybe by 2 per side, so 4*(i-1) in total. Because each side (left, right, top, bottom) is reduced by 2*(i-1).\n\nWait, let me think about the first example. Input is 3 3 1. So a 3x3 grid. The perimeter is 8, which matches the sample output.\n\nFor the second example, 7 9 1. The perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 32-4=28. Which matches the sample output of 28.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. So the first ring is 7x9, perimeter is 2*(7+9)-4=32-4=28. Then the second ring is (7-4)*(9-4) = 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5)-4=16-4=12. So total is 28+12=40, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is: for each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of that ring's rectangle, and sum them all.\n\nBut wait, how do I compute each ring's rectangle?\n\nFor ring i:\n\nThe initial width is w, height is h. For each ring, we subtract 2*(i-1) from each dimension, but only if the resulting dimensions are at least 3, because otherwise, there wouldn't be a ring. Or wait, the problem statement says that k is chosen such that each ring can fit. So for each i from 1 to k, the width and height are adjusted accordingly.\n\nWait, but how do the dimensions change with each ring? Let's see.\n\nRing 1: the rectangle is w x h. Its perimeter is 2*(w + h) -4.\n\nRing 2: the rectangle is (w-2*1) x (h-2*1) → because each side is reduced by 2. So perimeter is 2*((w-2)+(h-2)) -4.\n\nRing 3: (w-4) x (h-4). So each ring reduces both dimensions by 2*(i-1) for the i-th ring.\n\nSo for each i, current_w = w - 2*(i-1), current_h = h - 2*(i-1). Then, the perimeter is 2*(current_w + current_h) -4. But wait, if current_w or current_h is less than 2, then that ring can't exist. But the problem says that k is given such that it's valid, so we don't have to worry about that.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nFor each i from 1 to k:\n\n   current_w = w - 2*(i-1)\n\n   current_h = h - 2*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\n   total += perimeter\n\nReturn total.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps are straightforward.\n\nNow, thinking about the code.\n\nWe need to read the input as three integers: w, h, k.\n\nCompute the sum as described.\n\nIn Python, the code would be something like:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    cw = w - 2*(i-1)\n\n    ch = h - 2*(i-1)\n\n    perim = 2*(cw + ch) -4\n\n    total += perim\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, let's test this against the samples.\n\nFirst sample: 3 3 1.\n\ni=1: cw=3, ch=3. perim= 2*(6) -4= 12-4=8. total=8. Correct.\n\nSecond sample: 7 9 1.\n\nperim=2*(16) -4=32-4=28. Correct.\n\nThird sample: 7 9 2.\n\ni=1: 7*9 → 28.\n\ni=2: 7-2=5, 9-2=7. Wait wait wait, no.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait, for i=2, 2*(i-1) is 2*1=2. So cw =7-2=5, ch=9-2=7.\n\nPerimeter is 2*(5+7) -4 = 24-4=20? Wait wait, but in the sample, the sum is 28+12=40. Hmm, wait, my calculation must be wrong.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, for the third example, when i=2, the rectangle is 5x7.\n\nPerimeter is 2*(5+7) -4 = 24-4=20? No, 5+7 is 12, times 2 is 24, minus 4 gives 20. But according to the sample, the sum is 28+12=40. So why is the second ring 12?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, wait. Let me re-calculate the third example.\n\nSample input: 7 9 2.\n\ni=1: the outer ring.\n\ncurrent_w =7, current_h=9 → perim is 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16-4=32-4=28.\n\ni=2: current_w=7-2=5, current_h=9-2=7. So perim is 2*(5+7) -4 → 2*12=24-4=20. So total is 28+20=48. But sample output is 40.\n\nWait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, the sample output is 40. So I must have a bug in my logic.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I misunderstood the way the rings are formed.\n\nLet me look back at the problem statement.\n\nAh! Oh right, the problem says that the i-th ring consists of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w -4(i-1)) × (h -4(i-1)). Wait, wait, that's different from what I thought.\n\nWait, so for i=1, the rectangle is w-0= w, h-0= h.\n\nBut for i=2, it's w-4×1= w-4, h-4×1= h-4.\n\nOh! Oh right! I think I messed up the formula for current_w and current_h.\n\nSo for each ring i, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h -4*(i-1)). So the dimensions decrease by 4 per ring, not 2.\n\nThat changes everything.\n\nSo for the third sample:\n\ni=1: 7x9 → perim= 2*(7+9) -4= 32-4=28.\n\ni=2: 7-4=3, 9-4=5. So 3x5.\n\nPerim: 2*(3+5) -4= 16-4=12.\n\nTotal 28+12=40 → which matches the sample.\n\nOh, I see. So the mistake was in the initial approach. The problem statement says the i-th ring is based on a rectangle of size (w-4(i-1)) × (h-4(i-1)). So for each ring, the width and height are reduced by 4*(i-1), not 2*(i-1).\n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\nFor each i from 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w -4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\nperim = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\nsum to total.\n\nSo the code needs to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nSo now, let's re-calculate the third sample.\n\ni=1: 7-0=7, 9-0=9 → perim= 2*(16) -4=32-4=28.\n\ni=2:7-4=3, 9-4=5 → 3+5=8 → 2*8=16-4=12.\n\nTotal is 40.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: let's say w=7, h=9, k=3.\n\ni=1: 7x9 → 28.\n\ni=2: 3x5 → 12.\n\ni=3: 3-4= -1? Wait, that can't be. But since k is constrained by the problem, it will not allow that. So for each i, current_w and current_h are at least >=3? Or perhaps the constraints ensure that.\n\nSo the code should correctly handle the problem.\n\nSo the correct code is:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\nsum =0\n\nfor i in 1..k:\n\n    cw = w -4*(i-1)\n\n    ch = h -4*(i-1)\n\n    perim = 2*(cw + ch) -4\n\n    sum += perim\n\nprint sum.\n\nYes.\n\nSo now, the code should be written as follows.\n\nTesting the third example again, it works.\n\nAnother test case: let's take a 5x5 grid with k=1.\n\nPerimeter is 2*(5+5) -4=20-4=16.\n\nWhat's the actual count? The outer ring has 5*4 -4 =16 cells (since each row contributes 5 except the last which contributes 5, but the first and last columns contribute 5-2=3, but wait no, perhaps I should just think in terms of the perimeter formula.\n\nYes, 16 is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n    current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n    perim = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n    total += perim\nprint(total)\n\nYes, that's the correct code.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is a border around an inner rectangle that gets smaller with each subsequent ring.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Understanding**: Each ring is a border around an inner rectangle. The first ring is along the edge of the plate, the second ring is two cells inside the first ring, and so on. Each subsequent ring reduces both the width and height of the rectangle by 4 cells (2 cells from each side).\n\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the perimeter of the current rectangle can be calculated using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is \\(2 \\times (\\text{width} + \\text{height}) - 4\\). This accounts for the four corners being counted twice if we simply add the width and height.\n\n3. **Iterative Summation**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the current rectangle and accumulate the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perim = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n    total += perim\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: `w` (width), `h` (height), and `k` (number of rings).\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the current width and height of the rectangle after considering the reduction for the current ring.\n3. **Compute Perimeter**: For each ring, calculate the perimeter using the formula \\(2 \\times (\\text{width} + \\text{height}) - 4\\) and add it to the total count of gilded cells.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and summing up their perimeters, ensuring that each step is computed in constant time.",
