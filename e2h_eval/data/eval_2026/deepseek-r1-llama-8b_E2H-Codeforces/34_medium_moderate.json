And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. Hmm, let's see what the problem says.\n\nThe input is n and k, where n is the number of days and k is the number of consecutive days considered a week. Then there's a list of n integers representing each day's sleep time. My task is to compute the average over all possible weeks. Oh right, because each week is a window of k days, and there are (n - k + 1) such windows.\n\nWait, how do I approach this efficiently? Let's think about the steps involved.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the sum for each window of k days. Then, sum all those window sums and divide by the number of windows. That gives the average.\n\nBut wait, if n is up to 2e5, then doing this naively with O(n*k) time would be too slow. So I need a more efficient way.\n\nOh right, the sliding window technique! Because each window after the first is just the previous window minus the element leaving and adding the new element entering.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So I can calculate the initial sum of the first window, then for each subsequent window, subtract the outgoing element and add the incoming one. Then keep a running total of all the window sums.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read n, k and the list a.\n2. Compute the sum of the first window (first k elements).\n3. Add this sum to the total.\n4. For each next window (from i = k to i = n-1):\n   a. Subtract a[i - k] from the current sum.\n   b. Add a[i].\n   c. Add this new sum to the total.\n5. After processing all windows, divide the total by (n - k + 1) to get the average.\n6. Output the average with sufficient precision.\n\nBut wait, what about the data types? Since n can be up to 2e5 and each a_i up to 1e5, the maximum sum could be around 2e10 per window, multiplied by 2e5 windows, giving 4e15 for the total sum. That fits within a Python int, so no issues there.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nWhat if k equals n? Then there's only one window, the sum is the total of all elements, average is same as that.\n\nIf k is 1, then each element is its own window, and the average is the sum divided by n.\n\nAnother case: when n is equal to k, output is sum / 1.\n\nWhat about when the list has zeros or other small numbers? Doesn't matter, the code should handle it.\n\nAlso, the output needs to have at least six decimal digits, but possibly more. So in Python, we can format it as a float with enough precision.\n\nWait, but how precise do we need to be? The problem states that the answer is correct if the absolute or relative error is within 1e-6. So we should output enough digits to ensure that.\n\nIn Python, using the format string like \"%.10f\" might not be sufficient because sometimes the division could result in more than 10 digits after decimal, but perhaps we can just output as many as needed, but to avoid truncating, maybe using something like 12 digits and letting the code handle it.\n\nAlternatively, since in the sample outputs, sometimes 10 digits are given, perhaps we can print 10 or more digits. Wait, looking at the examples:\n\nIn the third example, the output is 28964.2857142857, which is 10 digits after the decimal. So perhaps printing 10 digits is enough.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Compute the total sum of all windows.\n- Divide by the number of windows, which is (n -k +1).\n- Print the result with at least 10 decimal digits.\n\nNow, let's outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read n and k from input. Then read the list a.\n\nCompute the initial window sum: sum(a[0:k]).\n\nThen, for i in range(k, n):\n\n   current_sum -= a[i -k]\n   current_sum += a[i]\n   total += current_sum\n\nThen, average = total / (n -k +1)\n\nPrint average with 10 decimal digits.\n\nWait, but in Python, integer division is a problem. So when we divide, it's better to cast to float, or use floating point division.\n\nYes, in Python 3, dividing two integers with / gives a float.\n\nSo code:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nif k > n:\n    # But according to constraints, k <= n, so this won't happen.\n    pass\n\ntotal = 0\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\ntotal += current_sum\n\nfor i in range(k, n):\n    current_sum -= a[i -k]\n    current_sum += a[i]\n    total += current_sum\n\naverage = total / (n - k +1)\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but in the sample inputs, for the third example:\n\nInput is 8 2, and a is [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n\nSo n=8, k=2, so 7 windows.\n\nEach window is:\n\n1+2=3\n\n2+4=6\n\n4+100000=100004\n\n100000+123=100123\n\n123+456=579\n\n456+789=1245\n\n789+1=790\n\nSum these:\n\n3 +6=9; +100004=100013; +100123=200136; +579=200715; +1245=201,960? Wait, wait, maybe better to compute as per the code.\n\nBut in any case, the code will correctly compute the sum.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input:\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nThe code's calculation:\n\nInitial current_sum = 1+2=3.\n\nAdd to total (now 3).\n\ni=2 (third element, index 2), which is 4:\n\ncurrent_sum -= a[0] (1) → 3-1=2, add a[2]=4 → 6. Add to total (3+6=9).\n\ni=3: a[3]=100000. current_sum =6 - a[1]=2 →4, add a[3]=100000 →100004. Add to total →9+100004=100013.\n\ni=4: a[4]=123. current_sum =100004 - a[2]=4 →99900. Add 123 →100023. Add to total: 100013+100023=200036.\n\ni=5: a[5]=456. current_sum =100023 - a[3]=100000 →23, add 456 →479. Total becomes 200036+479=200515.\n\ni=6: a[6]=789. current_sum =479 - a[4]=123 →356, add 789 →1145. Total now 200515+1145=201660.\n\ni=7: a[7]=1. current_sum =1145 - a[5]=456 →689, add 1 →690. Total 201660+690=202350.\n\nSo the total is 202350. Number of windows is 7. Average is 202350 /7 = 28964.2857142857... So the output is 28964.2857142857, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: the second sample input is 1 1. So n=1, k=1. Only one window, sum is 10, average 10.\n\nThird sample in the input is the first one: n=3, k=2.\n\nWindows are [3,4], [4,7]. Sum is 7 +11 =18. Divided by 2 gives 9. So output is 9.0000000000.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nWhat about when k is 0? Oh, no, constraints say 1<=k<=n.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, considering the problem statement, it's important to output the number with at least 6 decimal digits, but the sample shows 10. So perhaps in the code, we can format it to 10 or more digits, ensuring that any required precision is met.\n\nSo in the code, use .10f, but sometimes the actual value may require more digits. However, in Python, when you print with .10f, it rounds to 10 digits. So perhaps it's better to use more, like .12f, but the problem allows any representation as long as the error is within 1e-6.\n\nWait, the problem says that the answer is correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 1e-6. So perhaps using 10 digits is sufficient.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps we should output 10 or more digits.\n\nIn the sample, the third case was printed with 10 digits. So the code uses .10f, which is correct.\n\nSo in conclusion, the code should work.\n\nLet me write the code accordingly.\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the list a.\n\nIf k is larger than n, but according to the constraints, it's not possible, but the code can proceed as is.\n\nCompute the initial sum.\n\nThen loop from k to n-1, updating the current sum and adding to the total.\n\nCompute the average, and print with 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks based on given records of sleep times for consecutive days. Each week is defined as a sequence of k consecutive days.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves computing the average sleep time over all possible windows of k consecutive days from a list of sleep times. Each window represents a week, and there are (n - k + 1) such windows.\n2. **Efficient Calculation**: Using a sliding window technique allows us to efficiently compute the sum of each window in O(n) time complexity. This avoids the inefficiency of recalculating the sum for each window from scratch.\n3. **Sliding Window Technique**:\n   - Compute the sum of the first window of k days.\n   - For each subsequent window, adjust the sum by subtracting the element that is leaving the window and adding the new element that is entering the window.\n   - Keep a running total of these window sums.\n4. **Compute Average**: After processing all windows, compute the average by dividing the total sum by the number of windows.\n5. **Precision Handling**: Ensure the result is printed with sufficient precision to meet the problem's requirements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ntotal = 0\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\ntotal += current_sum\n\nfor i in range(k, n):\n    current_sum -= a[i - k]\n    current_sum += a[i]\n    total += current_sum\n\naverage = total / (n - k + 1)\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of days `n`, the number of days per week `k`, and the list of sleep times for each day.\n2. **Initial Window Sum**: The sum of the first k elements is computed to initialize the sliding window sum.\n3. **Sliding Window Update**: For each subsequent window, the current sum is updated by removing the outgoing element and adding the incoming element. This sum is added to the total.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The total sum of all windows is divided by the number of windows to get the average sleep time.\n5. **Output Precision**: The result is formatted to 10 decimal places to ensure the required precision.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles all edge cases within the problem constraints.",
