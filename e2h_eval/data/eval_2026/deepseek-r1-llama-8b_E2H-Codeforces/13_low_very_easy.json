For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine whether a given triad is major, minor, or strange. Hmm, let's break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the input is three notes, like 'C E G' or 'C# B F'. The output depends on whether these notes form a major, minor, or neither chord.\n\nWait, the problem says that a triad is major if when ordered X, Y, Z, the distances between X-Y is 4 semitones and Y-Z is 3. For minor, it's the opposite: X-Y is 3, Y-Z is 4. So my plan is to take all possible permutations of the three notes, calculate their distances in a circular way, and see if any permutation satisfies either the major or minor condition.\n\nBut wait, how do I represent the notes numerically? Oh right, each note can be assigned a number based on its position in the list. Let me think: the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, no, wait—wait, the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So let me count them:\n\nC is 0,\nC# is 1,\nD is 2,\nD# is 3,\nE is 4,\nF is 5,\nF# is 6,\nG is 7,\nG# is 8,\nA is 9,\nB is 10,\nH is 11.\n\nSo each note has a unique index from 0 to 11.\n\nNow, for any two notes, the distance from lower to higher is (y - x) mod 12. But wait, since the scale is cyclic, after H comes C again. So for example, the distance from H (11) to C (0) is 1 semitone, but according to the problem statement, the distance is measured from the lower tone to the upper. So the distance between C and E is 4 semitones because E is the fourth note after C.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone.\" So each step is 1 semitone. So for any two notes, the distance is (y - x) mod 12, but since the distance is always from lower to higher, perhaps the minimal way is to compute (y -x) % 12. Wait, no—because if x is higher than y, then (y - x) would be negative, but mod 12 would give the correct positive distance.\n\nWait, let's see: for example, the distance between H and C is 1 semitone. So H is 11, C is 0. (0 - 11) = -11. Mod 12 is 1. So yes, the distance between x and y is (y -x) % 12. Because if x < y, then it's y -x, which is correct. If x > y, then it's (y -x + 12) mod 12, which gives the correct distance as well.\n\nSo the function to compute the distance is (y - x) % 12.\n\nNow, for the given three notes, say a, b, c. I need to consider all possible orderings (permutations) of these three notes, and for each permutation (x, y, z), compute d1 = (y -x) % 12, d2 = (z - y) % 12. If d1 is 4 and d2 is 3, then it's a major triad. If d1 is 3 and d2 is 4, then minor.\n\nBut wait, the triad is unordered. So the order in which we arrange the notes matters for checking the conditions, but since it's unordered, any permutation that satisfies the condition makes the triad of that type.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Convert each note to its numerical value (0-11).\n2. Generate all possible permutations of these three notes.\n3. For each permutation, check if the first two notes' distance is 4, and the next two's is 3. Or, check if the first two is 3 and the next two is 4.\n4. If any permutation satisfies major condition, the triad is major.\n5. Similarly for minor.\n6. If neither condition is met, output 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where multiple permutations satisfy the condition? Like, maybe a triad could be both major and minor in some ordering. But the problem statement says that Vasya promises that the answer is unambiguous, so no such cases exist. So we can stop checking once we find a major or minor condition.\n\nSo now, the steps in code:\n\nRead the input line,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. A major triad is defined by specific distances between its notes, as is a minor triad. Our task is to check all possible orderings of the notes and classify the triad accordingly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Notes to Numerical Values**: Each note is assigned a unique index based on its position in the musical scale. This helps in calculating the distance between notes.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: Since the triad is unordered, we consider all permutations of the three notes to check each possible ordering.\n3. **Calculate Distances**: For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n4. **Check Conditions**: Determine if the permutation satisfies the conditions for a major or minor triad. If either condition is met, classify the triad accordingly. If neither is satisfied, classify it as strange.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Assign each note a numerical value\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_values = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\ndef get_distance(a, b):\n    return (b - a) % 12\n\ndef classify_triad(triad):\n    # Convert notes to their numerical values\n    a, b, c = [note_values[note] for note in triad]\n    # Check all possible permutations\n    for perm in permutations([a, b, c]):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        d1 = get_distance(x, y)\n        d2 = get_distance(y, z)\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            return 'major'\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            return 'minor'\n    return 'strange'\n\n# Read input\ninput_notes = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()\nprint(classify_triad(input_notes))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Conversion**: Each note is converted to a numerical value based on its position in the musical scale. This allows us to use modular arithmetic to compute distances.\n2. **Permutations**: By generating all permutations of the three notes, we ensure that every possible ordering is considered.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated as the difference modulo 12, which correctly handles the cyclic nature of the scale.\n4. **Classification**: For each permutation, we check if it meets the criteria for a major or minor triad. The first matching condition determines the classification, ensuring an efficient check.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures the correct classification of the triad.",
