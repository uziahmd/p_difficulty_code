Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter 'X'. Hmm, let's think about what the problem says.\n\nThe conditions for it being an X are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter all along.\n2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must be the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nWait, right. So first, I need to check the two main diagonals. For each cell in both diagonals, they should all be the same character. Let's call that the 'X' character.\n\nThen, all the cells that are not on either of these diagonals should be the same and different from the 'X' character.\n\nSo, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is n, followed by n lines each with n characters. So I'll read n, then read each line as a list or string, maybe as a 2D list.\n\nNext, I need to find out what the 'X' character is. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the diagonals must be the same. So first, I'll check the top-left to bottom-right diagonal and the top-right to bottom-left diagonal. If they are all the same, that's the X character. Otherwise, it's not an X.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the diagonals should be all the same. So if any cell in either diagonal doesn't match, the answer is NO.\n\nOnce I confirm that both diagonals are the same, then I need to check the non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Read n.\n2. Read the grid into a 2D array.\n3. Check the two diagonals:\n   a. For each cell in diagonal 1 (i == j), collect their values.\n   b. For each cell in diagonal 2 (i + j == n-1), collect their values.\n   c. If all in diagonal 1 are same, and all in diagonal 2 are same, and they are equal, proceed.\n   d. Else, output NO.\n4. Now, check the other cells: those not on either diagonal.\n5. All these cells must be the same and different from the X character.\n6. If all conditions are met, output YES; else, NO.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, for the diagonals:\n\nFor each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n- For the main diagonal, j = i. So for each cell (i,j) where j == i, check if all are same.\n- For the other diagonal, j = n-1 - i. So for each cell (i, j) where j != i, but j = n-1 -i, check if all are same.\n\nWait, but the condition is that both diagonals must consist of the same character. So the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal must be the same across all their cells.\n\nSo perhaps, first, we can check all the cells in both diagonals to see if they are the same across both.\n\nWait, no. The main diagonal must be all same, and the anti-diagonal must also be all same. But those two diagonals might have different characters. So the condition is that the main diagonal has the same character as the anti-diagonal.\n\nWait, the problem says: on both diagonals, all letters are the same. So both diagonals must consist of the same letters, and all letters in each diagonal are same.\n\nSo, for example, if the main diagonal has 'x's and the anti has 'x's, that's good. But if the main has 'x's and the anti has 'y's, then it's invalid.\n\nSo step 3a and 3b: collect the main diagonal and anti-diagonal, check each is same, and that both are same.\n\nSo code-wise:\n\nmain_diag = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\nanti_diag = [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n\nif len(main_diag) != len(set(main_diag)) or len(anti_diag) != len(set(anti_diag)):\n    # some variation in main or anti, so NO\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif main_diag[0] != anti_diag[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nSo now, the X character is main_diag[0].\n\nThen, for the other cells (non-diagonal), check if they are all the same and not equal to X.\n\nSo for each cell (i,j) where i != j and i + j != n-1:\n\ncollect the value, check if all are same and different from X.\n\nSo, collect all the non-diagonal cells into a list, say others.\n\nIf others is empty, which happens when n=1, but n >=3 here, since n is odd and 3<=n<300.\n\nWait, n can be 3, but for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are the four corners? No, wait for n=3, the grid is 3x3.\n\nWait, for i and j where i !=j and i+j != 2 (since n-1 is 2). So for 3x3 grid:\n\ncells are:\n\n(0,0) -> diagonal\n(0,1): non\n(0,2): anti\n(1,0): non\n(1,1): diagonal\n(1,2): non\n(2,0): non\n(2,1): non\n(2,2): diagonal\n\nSo non-diagonal cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1).\n\nSo for n=3, there are 5 non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nothers = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i != j and i + j != n-1:\n            others.append(grid[i][j])\n\nIf others is empty, then there are no non-diagonal cells, which only happens when n=1, but n>=3.\n\nElse, check that all elements in others are same and different from X.\n\nSo:\n\nif len(others) == 0:\n    # impossible, since n >=3, but just in case\nelse:\n    x_char = main_diag[0]\n    if len(set(others)) != 1 or others[0] == x_char:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\")\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n5\nxooox\noxoxo\nsoxoo\noxoxo\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is 5x5.\n\nCheck the main diagonal: positions (0,0)=x, (1,1)=o, (2,2)=x, (3,3)=o, (4,4)=x.\n\nSo main_diag is ['x', 'o', 'x', 'o', 'x'] → not all same. So condition fails, output NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample input:\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0)=w, (1,1)=s, (2,2)=w → not same. So condition fails. Wait wait, but according to sample output, the second case outputs YES.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, in the second sample input, it's:\n\n['3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw']\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the input format. Oh wait, the input is given as a list of strings, each representing a row.\n\nWait, the input is a list of strings, each string is a line. So for the second sample, it's:\n\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nSo main diagonal is (0,0)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,2)=w → all 'w's.\n\nAnti-diagonal is (0,2)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,0)=w → all 'w's.\n\nSo both diagonals are same, and 'w's. Then the non-diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,1)=s, (1,0)=s, (1,2)=s, (2,1)=s.\n\nSo others are all 's's, which is different from 'w's.\n\nThus, output is YES.\n\nSo in code, this would be correctly handled.\n\nAnother test case: third sample input.\n\n3\nxpx\npxp\nxpe\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0)=x, (1,1)=p, (2,2)=e → not all same. So output is NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase when n=3, and the diagonals are same, but non-diagonals are mixed.\n\nE.g.,\n\nx x x\n\nx x x\n\nx x x\n\nDiagonals are x's. Others are x's. So condition is that others must be different. So this would output NO.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are same, others are same but same as diagonals.\n\nE.g.:\n\nx o x\n\no o o\n\nx o x\n\nDiagonals are x's, others are o's. So others are same as each other, but same as diagonals. So condition fails.\n\nAnother case: n=3, non-diagonals are a mix. Like:\n\nw w w\n\nw w w\n\nw w w\n\nDiagonals are w's. Others are w's → same as diagonals. So output NO.\n\nWhat about when n=1? Well, n is at least 3, so no.\n\nWhat about when n=5 and all non-diagonal cells are same, but same as diagonals.\n\nLike:\n\nx x x x x\n\nx o o o x\n\nx o o o x\n\nx o o o x\n\nx x x x x\n\nDiagonals are x's. Others are o's, which is different. So output YES.\n\nAnother scenario: diagonals are same, others are same, but same as diagonals. Then output is NO.\n\nSo the code correctly handles that.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string. So grid is a list of lists, grid[i][j] is the j-th character of the i-th line.\n\nCheck main and anti diagonals.\n\nIf main diag is all same, anti diag is all same, and main diag's char equals anti's, proceed.\n\nElse, NO.\n\nCollect all non-diagonal cells.\n\nIf they are all same and not equal to X, then YES else NO.\n\nImplementing this.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling the grid correctly, ensuring that each line is properly read, stripping any newlines or spaces.\n\nIn Python, when reading lines via input(), each line includes the trailing newline. So for each line, we can strip() it to remove the newline, then process each character.\n\nWait, no. Because for a line like 'abc', input().strip() gives 'abc', which is correct. But if the line is empty, which is not possible here because n is at least 3.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    grid.append(list(line))\n\nThen proceed.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother thing: in the case when n is 1, but the constraints say n is odd and >=3, so no problem.\n\nTesting for len(others) == 0: won't happen, but in code, perhaps better to include a condition.\n\nBut in our problem, n is at least 3, so others cannot be empty.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid.\n\nCompute main_diag and anti_diag.\n\nCheck if main_diag has same chars, anti_diag has same, and main_diag[0] == anti_diag[0].\n\nIf not, output NO.\n\nElse, collect others.\n\nCheck if others are all same and not equal to X.\n\nIf yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    grid.append(list(line))\n\nmain_diag = []\nanti_diag = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    main_diag.append(grid[i][i])\n    anti_diag.append(grid[i][n-1 - i])\n\n# Check main diag same\nif len(set(main_diag)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check anti diag same\nif len(set(anti_diag)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check if main and anti are same\nif main_diag[0] != anti_diag[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Now, collect others\nothers = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i != j and (i + j) != (n-1):\n            others.append(grid[i][j])\n\n# Check others\nif len(others) == 0:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    x_char = main_diag[0]\n    if len(set(others)) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    elif others[0] == x_char:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but what if others is empty? For n=3, it's not possible. So in code, it's redundant, but safe.\n\nTesting sample 2:\n\nAfter processing, others is [s, s, s, s]. So len(set) is 1, others[0] is 's' which is different from 'w'. So output YES.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=5, grid as follows:\n\nx o o o x\n\no x x x o\n\no o x o o\n\no x x x o\n\nx o o o x\n\nmain diag: x, x, x, x, x → same.\n\nanti diag: x, x, x, x, x → same.\n\nothers: all 'o's, which is different.\n\nSo output YES.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3:\n\nx x x\n\nx x x\n\nx x x\n\nmain and anti are x's.\n\nothers are x's → same as x. So output NO.\n\nAnother case:\n\nn=3:\n\nx o x\n\no o o\n\nx o x\n\nmain diag: x, o, x → not all same. So output NO.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n",
