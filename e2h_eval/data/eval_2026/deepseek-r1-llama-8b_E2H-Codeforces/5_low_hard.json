Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Hmm, let's see. The problem says that two boots are compatible if their colors are the same or if one is a question mark. Oh right, because '?' is compatible with any color.\n\nSo the input gives me two strings, l and r, each of length n. Each character in l represents a left boot, and similarly for r. My goal is to pair as many left and right boots as possible, ensuring that each pair is compatible.\n\nWait, but each boot can be part of only one pair. So I need to select a subset of left and right boots such that each is used once, and every pair is compatible.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Let's think about the constraints. Since n can be up to 150,000, any O(n^2) approach is out of the question. So I need an efficient way.\n\nLet me think about the possible strategies. Maybe I can count for each possible color (including '?') how many lefts and rights I have. Then, for each color, pair as many as possible between left and right.\n\nBut wait, that might not account for the fact that some lefts can't pair with others due to being specific colors. For example, if a left is 'a' and the right is 'b', they can't pair. But if either is '?', then it can.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal way is to process all possible compatible pairs and match them in a way that maximizes the total. But again, with n being large, I need an efficient method.\n\nWait, maybe the solution involves creating a frequency map for each color in left and right, including the '?'. Then, for each color c, we can take the minimum of left_count[c] and right_count[c], and sum these minima. But also, the '?' can contribute by pairing with any other color.\n\nWait, no. Because when you have a '?', it can pair with any color, but each '?' can only pair once. So perhaps I should consider the '?' separately.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1. Compute for each color c, the count of left boots and right boots.\n   - For example, left_counts[c] = number of times c appears in l.\n   - Similarly for right_counts.\n\n2. Also, compute the number of '?' in l as left_q, and in r as right_q.\n\nNow, the '?' can pair with any color, including each other.\n\nSo the maximum number of pairs can be calculated as follows:\n\n- For each color c (a-z), the number of pairs is the minimum of left_counts[c] and right_counts[c].\n- Additionally, the number of '?' in l multiplied by the number of non-'?' in r plus the number of '?' in r multiplied by the number of non-'?' in l, but wait, that might not be correct because some '?'s are already accounted for in the color counts.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of the problem in terms of bipartite matching. Each left boot can be connected to right boots it can pair with. We need a maximum matching in this bipartite graph.\n\nBut with n up to 150,000, a standard maximum flow approach is impossible. So we need a smarter way.\n\nAnother idea: The maximum possible pairs is the sum over all colors of the minimum of left_counts[c] and right_counts[c], plus the remaining '?'s after considering their own pairings.\n\nWait, no. Because when you have a color c, the number of pairs from c is the minimum of left_counts[c] and right_counts[c]. However, the '?' can also form pairs with any other color, including themselves.\n\nBut wait, that's not accurate because a '?' can pair with any color, but each '?' can only be used once. So perhaps the optimal approach is to first pair as much as possible within the specific colors, then use the '?'s to cover the remaining.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the '?'s can be treated as a separate group that can pair with any other group.\n\nWait, here's a thought: Let's calculate for each color c, the number of pairs that can be formed without involving '?'. That's min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]). Then, the remaining left and right boots (after subtracting these pairs) can be considered as leftovers.\n\nAdditionally, the '?' can pair with any leftover, including each other.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nMaybe another approach is to model this as a graph where each left node is connected to all right nodes it can pair with. Then, the maximum matching would be the solution. But with n up to 150k, that's not feasible.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to:\n\n1. For each color c, compute how many pairs can be formed between left and right for that color. Sum these up.\n\n2. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (those not used in",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots such that each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot with compatible colors. The colors can be specific or indefinite (denoted by '?'), where a specific color is compatible only with itself, and an indefinite color is compatible with any other color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Frequencies**: First, we count the frequency of each color in both the left and right boot strings. This helps us determine how many pairs can be formed for each specific color without involving '?'.\n2. **Pair Specific Colors**: For each specific color, the number of pairs that can be formed is the minimum of the counts from the left and right boots.\n3. **Handle Indefinite Colors ('?')**: After pairing as many specific colors as possible, we use the remaining left and right boots (including those that couldn't be paired due to mismatched specific colors) to form pairs using '?'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    l = input[1]\n    r = input[2]\n\n    # Count frequencies for each color and '?'\n    left_counts = defaultdict(int)\n    for c in l:\n        if c == '?':\n            left_q += 1\n        else:\n            left_counts[c] += 1\n    right_counts = defaultdict(int)\n    for c in r:\n        if c == '?':\n            right_q += 1\n        else:\n            right_counts[c] += 1\n\n    # Calculate pairs from specific colors\n    total_pairs = 0\n    used_left = defaultdict(int)\n    used_right = defaultdict(int)\n\n    for c in set(left_counts.keys()).union(right_counts.keys()):\n        min_count = min(left_counts.get(c, 0), right_counts.get(c, 0))\n        total_pairs += min_count\n        used_left[c] += min_count\n        used_right[c] += min_count\n\n    # Now handle the remaining '?'\n    # Total available left: sum(left_counts.values()) -
