    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output all those n's in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n, because there are always more 2s than 5s. So for each multiple of 5, we add one zero, but multiples of higher powers like 25 contribute more.\n\nWait, right, the formula for the number of trailing zeros is the sum of n divided by 5, plus n divided by 25, plus n divided by 125, and so on until it's zero.\n\nSo, given m, I need to find all n where count_trailing_zeros(n) = m.\n\nBut how do I find the range of n's that give exactly m zeros?\n\nI think the approach is to find the minimal n such that the trailing zeros are at least m, and then check the next few numbers to see if they also give m zeros.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think about the behavior of the function count_trailing_zeros as n increases. It's a non-decreasing function because as n increases, the number of factors of 5 can't decrease. So for some m, there might be a range of n's that give exactly m zeros.\n\nFor example, in the sample input where m=5, the output is 5,6,7,8,9. So these are consecutive numbers starting from the first n that gives exactly 5 zeros.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find the smallest n where count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m.\n2. Then, check the next numbers (n, n+1, ...) until the count increases beyond m. All the ns in this range are valid.\n3. Collect all these ns and output them.\n\nBut how to efficiently find the starting point and the ending point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps binary search can help here. Because the count function is monotonic, we can use binary search to find the lower and upper bounds where the count equals m.\n\nWait, let's formalize this. Let’s denote f(n) as the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nWe need to find all n such that f(n) = m.\n\nBut since f(n) is non-decreasing, once f(n) exceeds m, we can stop searching.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n- Use binary search to find the smallest n_low where f(n_low) >= m.\n- Check if f(n_low) is exactly m. If not, then no solutions exist.\n- Otherwise, find the largest n_high where f(n_high) = m. This would be the maximum n that satisfies f(n) = m.\n\nOnce we have n_low and n_high, the numbers from n_low to n_high inclusive are the solutions.\n\nWait, but how do we handle the case when there are no such n? For example, if m is 0, but in the problem statement m starts from 1, so maybe m=0 isn't considered. But according to the problem statement, m is at least 1.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute f(n) for a given n.\n\nImplementing f(n) is straightforward. Let's code a helper function for that.\n\ndef count_zeroes(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, the binary search part.\n\nWe need to find the smallest n where f(n) >= m.\n\nBut wait, what's the possible range for n?\n\nWell, the maximum possible n for m up to 1e5 is manageable. For m=1e5, the corresponding n is around 5*1e5 = 5e5, but probably a bit higher. Wait, no. Because each 5 contributes one, each 25 contributes two, etc.\n\nWait, for example, for m=1e5, how big is n?\n\nThe sum 5^1 * k1 +5^2*k2 + ... = m.\n\nBut to get an upper bound, perhaps using the approximation where n is roughly 5*m, but considering higher exponents.\n\nBut for binary search, the lower bound can be 0 and the upper bound can be something like 5*(m) or even higher, say 5*(m+1). Because for m=1e5, 5*1e5 is 5e5, but the actual n may be a bit less.\n\nWait, for m=5, n starts at 5. So 5*5 is 25, which is way higher than needed. So perhaps setting the upper bound as 5*m is sufficient.\n\nWait, but for m=5, 5*5=25, but n is 5. So maybe 5*m is an over-estimate. Alternatively, perhaps set the upper bound as 5*(m) + something.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute an initial estimate of n.\n\nAnother approach: for a given m, the minimal n where f(n) >= m can be found via binary search between low=0 and high=5*m.\n\nBecause for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nSo, let's proceed with the binary search.\n\nSo, implement a function to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m.\n\nOnce we find that minimal n, say it's n_min.\n\nThen, we need to check if f(n_min) == m. If not, then no solution exists.\n\nOtherwise, find the maximal n where f(n) <= m. Wait, no. Because after n_min, the function may increase.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to find the lower and upper bounds for n where f(n) = m.\n\nSo, for n_low, it's the smallest n where f(n) = m.\n\nAnd for n_high, it's the largest n where f(n) = m.\n\nSo, the process would be:\n\n- Binary search to find the first n where f(n) >= m. Let's call this candidate.\n\n- Then, check if f(candidate) is m. If not, then there are no solutions.\n\n- If it is, then find the next numbers until f(n) > m. The last n where f(n)=m is the maximum.\n\nWait, but how to find the maximum n where f(n)=m.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps find the lower and upper bounds.\n\nWait, perhaps binary search again for the upper bound.\n\nWait, another approach: once n_min is found (the smallest n where f(n) = m), then the numbers after n_min may also have f(n)=m until f(n) increases.\n\nSo, we can start from n_min and incrementally check f(n) until it exceeds m, collecting all the ns that have f(n) = m.\n\nBut for m up to 1e5, this process should be efficient.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. Find n_min such that f(n_min) is the first n where f(n) >= m.\n\n2. Check if f(n_min) != m: if so, output 0.\n\n3. Else, find the maximum n_max where f(n) = m.\n\n   To find n_max, perhaps we can find the next n where f(n) > m, then n_max is that n minus 1.\n\n4. Once n_min and n_max are known, collect all n from n_min to n_max, inclusive.\n\n5. Output the count and the list.\n\nSo, how to implement step 3: find n_max.\n\nOne way is to start from n_min and keep checking n+1, n+2, etc., until f(n) exceeds m. Then, n_max is the previous n.\n\nBut for large m, this could be time-consuming. So, perhaps a binary search approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, since the function f(n) increases with n, once n_min is found, the next possible point where f(n) increases is somewhere after n_min.\n\nSo, perhaps, the maximum n_max can be found by looking for the first n where f(n) > m, and then n_max is n-1.\n\nSo, to find that, we can perform a binary search from n_min upwards.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think: after n_min, f(n) is m. We need to find the smallest n where f(n) > m. Then, the maximum is that n-1.\n\nSo, the binary search can be performed in the range [n_min, ... , upper_bound], looking for the first n where f(n) > m.\n\nWhat's the upper bound for this binary search? Well, perhaps 5*(m + 1), but that might vary.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For the upper part, find the smallest n where f(n) > m.\n\nThis can be done via binary search, starting from n_min.\n\nWait, but binary search requires knowing an upper limit. So, perhaps the upper limit can be 5*(m+1) or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, since for each step, the function f(n) increases by at least 1 (but possibly more, like when n crosses a multiple of 25, 125, etc.), the upper bound can be set as 5*(m+1).\n\nWait, perhaps 5*(m+1) is a safe upper limit because each 5 contributes at least one zero, so for m zeros, n can't be more than 5*m.\n\nWait, not exactly. Because 25 contributes two, 125 three, etc. So for m=5, the n_max is 9, which is 5*1.8, which is less than 5*5.\n\nSo perhaps 5*(m) is a good upper bound, but maybe even 5*(m+1) is enough.\n\nSo, the steps for finding n_max:\n\n- Initialize low = n_min.\n\n- Initialize high = 5*m (or 5*(m+1)).\n\n- While low < high:\n\n   - mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n   - if f(mid) > m:\n\n      - high = mid\n\n   - else:\n\n      - low = mid + 1\n\n- After the loop, the high is the smallest n where f(n) > m. So, n_max is high -1.\n\nWait, yes.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, let's outline the code structure.\n\nFirst, read the input m.\n\nThen, compute n_min using binary search.\n\nCheck if f(n_min) != m: output 0.\n\nElse, find n_max via binary search as described.\n\nCollect all n from n_min to n_max, inclusive.\n\nOutput the count and the list.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where n_min is larger than n_max? No, because if f(n_min) = m, then n_max is at least n_min.\n\nSo, let's code the helper function first.\n\ndef count_zeroes(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nThen, implement the binary search for n_min.\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m  # initial upper bound\n    n_min = None\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_zeroes(mid)\n        if z >= m:\n            high = mid -1\n            if z == m:\n                n_min = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    # After the loop, low is the first n where f(n)>=m\n    # So, n_min should be low?\n    # Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the binary search condition.\n\nWait, perhaps I should adjust the binary search to correctly find the first occurrence where f(n) >= m.\n\nAlternative approach for binary search to find the first n where f(n) >= m.\n\nInitialize low = 0, high = 5*m.\n\nresult = -1\n\nwhile low <= high:\n\n    mid = (low + high)//2\n\n    z = count_zeroes(mid)\n\n    if z >= m:\n\n        result = mid\n\n        high = mid -1\n\n    else:\n\n        low = mid +1\n\nif result == -1:\n\n    # No n found, which shouldn't happen as per problem constraints.\n\nelse:\n\n    return result\n\nWait, but in the sample input, for m=1:\n\nThe first n where f(n)>=1 is 5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the function returns 5, and then we check if f(5) is 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the find_min_n function would return 5.\n\nThen, we find n_max.\n\nBut wait, let's test.\n\nIn the sample input, m=5.\n\nfind_min_n(5) would return 5, since f(5)=1, which is less than 5. So that can't be.\n\nWait, wait no: for m=5, the first n where f(n)>=5 is 5? No, because 5//5=1, 5//25=0, so f(5)=1 <5.\n\nWait, so the initial approach for find_min_n is wrong.\n\nAh, right, my mistake. So, I need to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m.\n\nWait, in the sample input, m=5, the minimal n is 25?\n\nWait, no: 25//5=5, 25//25=1, total 6.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's calculate f(n) for various n.\n\nn=5: 5/5=1 → 1 zero.\n\nn=10: 10/5=2, 10/25=0 → 2 zeros.\n\nn=15: 3 zeros.\n\nn=20: 4.\n\nn=21:4.\n\nn=24:4.\n\nn=25:25//5=5, 25//25=1 → 5+1=6.\n\nSo, for m=5, the minimal n is 25? Because f(25)=6>5.\n\nWait, no. Because wait, the minimal n where f(n) >=5 is 20, because f(20)=4 <5, and f(21)=4, etc., until n=25, which is 6.\n\nSo, the function find_min_n(5) would return 25, but that's incorrect because the minimal n where f(n)>=5 is 25.\n\nBut in the sample, the correct n's are 5-9, which have f(n)=5.\n\nWait, that suggests that my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the sample input was '1' and '5', but the output was '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' for the second case. So, for m=5, the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier calculation, f(5) is 1, not 5.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the sample.\n\nWait, the sample input is ['1', '5'], but the output shows for the first case, the output is '5\\n5', meaning that only n=5 has exactly 1 trailing zero. That makes sense because 5! is 120, which ends with 1 zero.\n\nWait, but then the second case is m=5.\n\nLooking at 5! is 120 (1 zero), 6! is 720 (1), 7! is 5040 (1), 8! is 40320 (1), 9! is 362880 (2? Or is that 1? Wait, 8! is 40320 → 1 zero? Wait, 40320 ends with one zero.\n\nWait, 9! is 362880 → that's one zero as well.\n\nWait, 10! is 3628800 → two zeros.\n\nWait, so for m=5, how can any n have 5 trailing zeros?\n\nHmm, perhaps I've misunderstood the sample. Or perhaps the sample is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. The sample says m=5, and the output is 5,6,7,8,9. So for each of these, the number of trailing zeros is 5?\n\nWait, that's impossible because 5! is 120, which has 1 zero. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating the number of trailing zeros.\n\nWait, let's recalculate:\n\nn | n! | trailing zeros\n--- | --- | ---\n5 | 120 → 1\n6 | 720 → 1\n7 | 5040 → 1\n8 | 40320 → 1\n9 | 362880 → 1\n10 → 3628800 → 2\n\nSo, for m=5, there's no n where f(n)=5. So the sample must have been m=5 in the first case, but that's conflicting with the sample output.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is incorrect in the problem description. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the sample input. Oh, wait, the sample input is written as ['1','5'], but the output is for the first m=1, and the second m=5.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the first output line is '5\\n5', which indicates that for m=1, the only n is 5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThe second part of the sample is for m=5. The output is '0', meaning that there are zero n's that have exactly 5 trailing zeros.\n\nWait, that aligns with our earlier calculation.\n\nSo why does the sample output show '5 6 7 8 9' for m=5?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nSample output:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWait, that seems to indicate that for the first input, 1, the output is 5, and for the second input, 5, the output is 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nBut that can't be right because 5! has 1 zero.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement has the input as a single integer, but the sample is presented as a list of two inputs. Maybe the sample is not properly formatted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement's sample is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is for m=5, and the output is 0, but the problem statement shows a different output.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is a typo.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should proceed regardless.\n\nSo, back to the problem.\n\nThe approach is to find all n where f(n) = m.\n\nWe can model this as a binary search to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m.\n\nIf f(n_min) != m, then output 0.\n\nElse, find the maximal n where f(n) = m.\n\nOnce we have n_min and n_max, the numbers from n_min to n_max are the solutions.\n\nSo, for the sample input m=5, the function find_min_n(5) will return 25, because f(25) is 6 >=5.\n\nBut f(25) is 6, which is greater than 5. So, n_min is 25, but f(n_min) is 6 !=5. So, output 0.\n\nThus, the sample output for m=5 is 0, which is correct.\n\nBut then why does the sample output show 5 6 7 8 9?\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is a typo, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the number of trailing zeros in n! being exactly m.\n\nSo, in the sample, the first case is m=1, which is satisfied by n=5. So the output is 5.\n\nThe second case is m=5, which is not satisfied by any n, so the output is 0.\n\nSo, the sample output seems to have two parts, but perhaps it's a formatting issue.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem statement's sample is a bit confusing, but the code needs to correctly handle cases where m is achievable.\n\nSo, moving on.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute n_min via binary search, which is the first n where f(n) >=m.\n\nCheck if f(n_min) != m: output 0.\n\nElse, find n_max as the largest n where f(n) =m.\n\nTo find n_max, perform another binary search between n_min and some high value.\n\nOnce n_min and n_max are found, collect all n from n_min to n_max, inclusive.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- m=1: n_min=5, n_max=5.\n\n- m=2: n_min=10 (f(10)=2), n_max=14 (f(14)=2).\n\nWait, let's compute f(14):\n\n14//5=2, 14//25=0 → 2.\n\nf(15): 15//5=3, 15//25=0 →3.\n\nSo for m=2, the numbers are 10,11,12,13,14 →5 numbers.\n\nAnother example: m=6.\n\nf(25) is 6. What's the next n where f(n) increases?\n\n26: same as 25, 26//5=5, 26//25=1 →5+1=6.\n\n27: same →6.\n\nSimilarly, 29:6.\n\n30:30//5=6, 30//25=1 →7.\n\nSo, n_max for m=6 is 29.\n\nSo, the numbers are 25,26,27,28,29 →5 numbers.\n\nWait, wait: 25 is the first n where f(n) =6, and the last n is 29.\n\nSo, the count is 29-25+1=5.\n\nSo, the code should correctly capture this.\n\nNow, implementing the binary search for n_max.\n\nImplement a function find_max_n(m, n_min) that finds the largest n where f(n)=m.\n\ndef find_max_n(m, n_min):\n\n    low = n_min\n\n    high = 5 * m  # or a higher number\n\n    # We want to find the largest n where f(n) == m.\n\n    # So, find the smallest n where f(n) > m.\n\n    # Then, n_max is that n-1.\n\n    # So, perform binary search on [n_min, ... , high].\n\n    # Set high to a sufficiently large value.\n\n    # Let's set high to 5*(m+1) to cover higher exponents.\n\n    high = 5*(m+1)\n\n    res = n_min\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        z = count_zeroes(mid)\n\n        if z > m:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n        else:\n\n            res = mid\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return res\n\nWait, but this function is supposed to return the maximum n where f(n) =m.\n\nSo, during the binary search, if mid has f(mid) <=m, we can set res=mid, and look for higher.\n\nElse, we need to go lower.\n\nAt the end, res is the maximum n where f(n) <=m.\n\nWait, but we need f(n) =m, so perhaps the function should check whether f(res) is m.\n\nBut in our case, since n_min is the first n where f(n)>=m, and f(n_min)=m, then for all n >=n_min, f(n) >=m.\n\nWait, no. Because f(n) can jump over m.\n\nWait, for example, if m=5, and n_min is 25, which has f(n_min)=6>m. So, in that case, there are no solutions.\n\nWait, but in the code, after finding n_min, we check if f(n_min) ==m. If not, output 0.\n\nSo, in the function find_max_n, the initial low is n_min, which is the first n where f(n)>=m.\n\nBut in that case, if f(n_min) >m, then the function returns nothing.\n\nSo, in the code, after finding n_min, if f(n_min)!=m, output 0.\n\nElse, proceed to find the maximum n where f(n)=m.\n\nThus, in find_max_n, the low is n_min, which is the first n where f(n)=m.\n\nSo, in the binary search, we can find the highest n where f(n) <=m.\n\nBut since we know that f(n_min)=m, and f(n) is non-decreasing, the maximum n where f(n)=m is the largest n where f(n)=m.\n\nSo, the function can proceed to find the maximum n.\n\nNow, testing the code.\n\nTest case 1: m=1.\n\nn_min is 5.\n\nf(5) is 1.\n\nfind_max_n(1,5):\n\nWe need to find the largest n where f(n)=1.\n\nSo, the binary search:\n\nlow=5, high=5*(1+1)=10.\n\nLoop:\n\nmid= (5+10)/2=7.\n\nf(7)=1.\n\nSet res=7, low=8.\n\nNext iteration: mid=(8+10)/2=9.\n\nf(9)=1.\n\nres=9, low=10.\n\nNext: mid=10.\n\nf(10)=2>1.\n\nSo, high=9.\n\nLoop ends.\n\nres=9.\n\nThus, n_max=9.\n\nBut wait, f(9)=1, yes.\n\nSo, the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9: 5 numbers.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation said 5! has 1 zero, 6! has 1, etc., up to 9!, which also has 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code would collect 5-9.\n\nSo, for m=1, the output is 5 numbers.\n\nAnother test case: m=5.\n\nn_min is 25, since f(25)=6 >=5.\n\nBut f(25)=6 !=5. So, output is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nn_min is 25, since f(25)=6.\n\nfind_max_n(6,25):\n\nWe look for the largest n where f(n)=6.\n\nLet's see:\n\nn=25:6.\n\nn=26: same.\n\n...\n\nn=29: same.\n\nn=30:7.\n\nSo, the maximum is 29.\n\nThus, the numbers are 25-29: 5 numbers.\n\nSo, the code would output 5 followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nAnother test case: m=0.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, m is at least 1, so no need to handle.\n\nAnother test case: m=2.\n\nn_min is 10, f(10)=2.\n\nfind_max_n(2,10):\n\nhigh=5*(2+1)=15.\n\nLoop:\n\nmid= (10+15)/2=12.\n\nf(12)=2.\n\nset res=12, low=13.\n\nmid= (13+15)/2=14.\n\nf(14)=2.\n\nset res=14, low=15.\n\nmid=15.\n\nf(15)=3>2.\n\nso high=14.\n\nloop ends.\n\nres=14.\n\nThus, the numbers are 10-14: 5 numbers.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should correctly handle these cases.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nImplementing the functions:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute n_min using find_min_n(m).\n\nIf f(n_min) !=m: print 0.\n\nElse, compute n_max using find_max_n(m, n_min).\n\nCollect the list from n_min to n_max, inclusive.\n\nPrint the count and the list.\n\nSo, now, write the code.\n\nBut wait, in Python, for handling very large m (like 1e5), the binary search is efficient.\n\nSo, the code is as follows.\n\nImplement helper function count_zeroes.\n\nImplement find_min_n.\n\nImplement find_max_n.\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute n_min.\n\nIf count_zeroes(n_min) !=m: print 0.\n\nElse, compute n_max.\n\nCollect the list.\n\nPrint len(list), then the list.\n\nNow, implement.\n\nBut wait, in the code, when reading input, the input is a single integer m.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nm = int(input().strip())\n\nNow, write the functions.\n\nBut in Python, functions are not necessary, but it's easier to code with helper functions.\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\ndef count_zeroes(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    n_min = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_zeroes(mid)\n        if z >= m:\n            high = mid -1\n            if z == m:\n                n_min = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    # After loop, low is the first n where f(n)>=m\n    if count_zeroes(low) != m:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return low\n\ndef find_max_n(m, n_min):\n    low = n_min\n    high = 5 * (m + 1)\n    res = n_min\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_zeroes(mid)\n        if z > m:\n            high = mid -1\n        else:\n            res = mid\n            low = mid +1\n    return res\n\nm = int(input())\nn_min = find_min_n(m)\nif n_min == -1:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    if count_zeroes(n_min) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        n_max = find_max_n(m, n_min)\n        if n_max < n_min:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            nums = list(range(n_min, n_max +1))\n            print(len(nums))\n            print(' '.join(map(str, nums)))\n\nWait, but wait in find_min_n, the function may return -1 if no n is found where f(n)>=m, but according to the problem statement, m is >=1, and for m=1, n=5 is found. So perhaps the function should always return a value.\n\nWait, no. For example, if m=100000, which is allowed, but perhaps the function returns a value.\n\nBut perhaps the find_min_n function should not return -1, but instead raise an error or something else, but according to the problem statement, m can be as high as 1e5, and the code is expected to handle that.\n\nWait, in the find_min_n function, after the binary search, the code checks if count_zeroes(low) ==m. But in some cases, low could be beyond 5*m, but the function will find that.\n\nWait, perhaps the find_min_n function can be rewritten to directly return low, because after the binary search, low is the first n where f(n)>=m.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can be adjusted as follows.\n\nRewriting find_min_n:\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_zeroes(mid)\n        if z >= m:\n            high = mid -1\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    # Now, low is the minimal n where f(n)>=m.\n    # Check if f(low) is m.\n    if count_zeroes(low) != m:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return low\n\nSo, if the returned n_min is -1, then no solution.\n\nWait, but in reality, for m=1, the function returns 5, which is correct.\n\nSo, the code can be adjusted to:\n\nm = int(input())\nn_min = find_min_n(m)\nif n_min == -1 or count_zeroes(n_min) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_max = find_max_n(m, n_min)\n    if n_max < n_min:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        print(len(range(n_min, n_max+1)))\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_min, n_max+1))))\n\nWait, but in the sample input where m=1, the code would print 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWait, no, in that case, for m=1, n_min is 5, and n_max is 9.\n\nThus, the code would print 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut wait, 5! has 1 zero, 6! has 1, etc., up to 9! which has 1 zero.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nTesting for m=5:\n\nn_min is 25, f(25)=6 !=5 → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nn_min is 25, f(25)=6.\n\nn_max is 29.\n\nSo, output 5 numbers:25-29.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: m=2.\n\nn_min is 10.\n\nn_max is 14.\n\nSo, output 5 numbers:10-14.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: m=3.\n\nn_min is 15.\n\nf(15)=3.\n\nn_max is 19.\n\nf(19)=3.\n\nSo, numbers 15-19:5 numbers.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, let's test the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input: '1' and '5'.\n\nWait, no, the input is a single integer m.\n\nWait, the sample input is given as ['1', '5'], but perhaps that's a formatting issue. For the purpose of the code, the input is a single integer.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the input is a single integer m.\n\nSo, the code reads m as int(input()).\n\nSo, in the sample input, perhaps it's a typo, and the input is actually a single integer.\n\nBut in the sample output, the first case is m=1, and the second is m=5, but perhaps the sample is for two separate runs.\n\nBut the code should handle each run separately.\n\nSo, for m=1, the code outputs 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nFor m=5, the code outputs 0.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The binary search in find_max_n may take too long for very large m.\n\nBut for m up to 1e5, 5*(m+1) is 5e5+5, and the binary search will take about 20 steps, which is acceptable.\n\nThus, the code should handle all test cases within the constraints.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. Additionally, we need to output all such integers in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence. Since 10 = 2 * 5 and there are always more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the count of factors of 5. This count can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{count} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until the division result is zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Minimum \\( n \\)**: To find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the number of trailing zeros is at least \\( m \\), we use binary search. This helps efficiently narrow down the range where the count of trailing zeros meets or exceeds \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Binary Search for Maximum \\( n \\)**: Once the minimum \\( n \\) is found, we then find the largest \\( n \\) such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly \\( m \\). This is done by another binary search starting from the minimum \\( n \\) and checking higher values until the count exceeds \\( m \\).\n\n4. **Collecting Results**: After determining the range of valid \\( n \\) values, we collect all integers in this range and output them.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeroes(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_zeroes(mid)\n        if z >= m:\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    if count_zeroes(low) != m:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return low\n\ndef find_max_n(m, n_min):\n    low = n_min\n    high = 5 * (m + 1)\n    res = n_min\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_zeroes(mid)\n        if z > m:\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            res = mid\n            low = mid + 1\n    return res\n\nm = int(input())\nn_min = find_min_n(m)\nif n_min == -1 or count_zeroes(n_min) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_max = find_max_n(m, n_min)\n    if n_max < n_min:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        nums = list(range(n_min, n_max + 1))\n        print(len(nums))\n        print(' '.join(map(str, nums)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input integer \\( m \\) is read.\n2. **Finding Minimum \\( n \\)**: Using binary search, the smallest \\( n \\) where the number of trailing zeros is at least \\( m \\) is found.\n3. **Checking Validity**: If the count of trailing zeros at this minimum \\( n \\) is not exactly \\( m \\), output 0.\n4. **Finding Maximum \\( n \\)**: Using another binary search, the largest \\( n \\) where the count of trailing zeros is exactly \\( m \\) is found.\n5. **Output Results**: The valid integers \\( n \\) are collected and printed in the required format.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, ensuring the solution is both optimal and handles the constraints effectively.",
