    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on the sides. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem states that Yuri has favorite numbers A, B, C, D where A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. We need to find the number of triangles with integer sides x, y, z such that:\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B\nB ≤ y ≤ C\nC ≤ z ≤ D\n\nAnd also, these sides must satisfy the triangle inequality for a non-degenerate triangle. That means, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since we're dealing with x ≤ y ≤ z (because x is up to B, y is from B onwards, and z is at least C which is ≥ y), the main condition we need to check is x + y > z. Because if x + y > z holds, then automatically the other inequalities will hold since x ≤ y ≤ z.\n\nSo our goal is to count all triplets (x, y, z) where x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], z is in [C, D], and x ≤ y ≤ z, and x + y > z.\n\nHmm, how can I efficiently compute this without iterating through all possible x, y, z? Because if I do that, it would be way too slow for large values of A, B, C, D (up to 5e5). So I need a mathematical approach.\n\nLet me think about the constraints:\n\nx can range from A to B.\nFor each x, y ranges from max(B, x) to C. Since B >= x (since A <= B and x <= B), y starts at B.\nz ranges from C to D, but must be less than x + y.\n\nWait, no. Wait, because y can be as small as B, and z starts at C. So for each x and y, I need to find the number of z's that are >= C, <= D, and < x + y.\n\nBut wait, z must also be >= y, because the order is x ≤ y ≤ z. So the lower bound for z is max(y, C). But since y is between B and C, and C >= B, then for each y, z starts at C (since C >= y).\n\nSo for a fixed x and y, z can be from C to min(D, x + y - 1). Because z has to be less than x + y.\n\nSo the number of z's for a particular x and y is the maximum of 0 and (min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1). Because z starts at C and goes up to that min value.\n\nSo the total number of valid triangles is the sum over all x in [A, B], and y in [B, C], of max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1), provided that x + y > C (since otherwise min would be less than C, giving 0).\n\nWait, but even when x + y > C, z has to be >= C and < x + y. So the condition is x + y > C. Otherwise, there are no z's satisfying both z >= C and z < x + y.\n\nSo for each x and y, we need to check if x + y > C. If yes, then the number of z's is the number of integers from C to min(D, x+y-1), inclusive. Which is max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1).\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nLoop over x from A to B.\nFor each x, loop over y from B to C.\nIf x + y > C:\n   calculate the lower and upper bounds for z:\n      lower = C\n      upper = min(D, x + y - 1)\n   if upper >= lower: add (upper - lower + 1) to the count\nElse:\n   add 0.\n\nBut looping through each x and y could be O((B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1)), which might be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 operations. That's way too slow for Python.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about how to precompute or find a mathematical formula that allows us to compute the sum without iterating every possible x and y.\n\nFirst, let's note that for a fixed x, y can vary from B to C. So for each x, the y's are in [B, C].\n\nWe can model the problem for each x as:\n\nsum_{y = B}^{C} [if x + y > C, then (min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1), else 0]\n\nBut again, doing this for each x and y is too slow.\n\nAlternative idea: For a fixed x, find the range of y where x + y > C, and compute the sum over those y's.\n\nSo for x fixed:\n\ny must be >= (C - x + 1), because x + y > C => y > C -x. Since y is an integer, y >= C - x + 1.\n\nBut y also has to be >= B, so the lower bound for y is max(B, C - x + 1).\n\nAdditionally, y cannot exceed C, since y's maximum is C.\n\nSo for a given x, the y's start at y_low = max(B, C - x + 1), and go up to y_high = C.\n\nIf y_low > y_high, then there are no valid y's for this x.\n\nOtherwise, for each y in [y_low, y_high], the number of z's is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1).\n\nWait, but for each y in [y_low, y_high], the z's are from C to min(D, x + y -1). So the count is max(0, (min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1)).\n\nWe can split this into two cases based on whether x + y -1 >= D or not.\n\nSo, let's consider for a given x, the y ranges, and then for each y, the contribution to the total count is either (D - C + 1) if x + y - 1 >= D, or (x + y -1 - C + 1) otherwise.\n\nBut again, this seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps we can find the y's for which x + y -1 >= D. Let's find the y >= (D - x + 1). Because x + y -1 >= D => y >= D - x + 1.\n\nSo for y >= y0, where y0 = max(y_low, D - x + 1), the z count is (D - C + 1).\n\nFor y < y0, the count is (x + y -1 - C + 1) = x + y - C.\n\nSo for a fixed x, the total contribution is:\n\nnumber_of_y_in [y_low, y_high] where y >= y0: each contributes (D - C + 1)\n\nplus\n\nnumber_of_y_in [y_low, y0-1] (but only if y0-1 >= y_low): each contributes (x + y - C)\n\nSo, let me formalize this:\n\nFor a fixed x:\n\ny_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\ny_high = C\n\nif y_low > y_high: continue\n\nWithin this y range, find the point y0 where y >= y0 contributes (D - C + 1) to the count.\n\ny0 is max(y_low, D - x + 1)\n\nSo:\n\ncase 1: y0 > y_high: then all y in [y_low, y_high] contribute (x + y - C). So the sum is sum_{y=y_low}^{y_high} (x + y - C).\n\ncase 2: y0 <= y_high: then the sum is:\n\nsum_{y=y_low}^{y0-1} (x + y - C) + (y_high - y0 + 1) * (D - C + 1)\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to calculating these sums efficiently.\n\nNow, let's compute the sum in case 1:\n\nsum_{y=a}^b (x + y - C) = sum_{k = (x + a - C)}^{(x + b - C)} k \n\nBecause when y increases by 1, x + y - C increases by 1.\n\nSo this sum is the sum of consecutive integers from (x + a - C) to (x + b - C).\n\nWhich is equal to:\n\nnumber_of_terms * (first + last) / 2\n\nwhere number_of_terms = b - a + 1\n\nSimilarly, for case 2, the first part is sum from a to d (d = y0-1) of (x + y - C), which is similar.\n\nSo, for each x, we can compute the contributions as follows:\n\nCompute y_low and y_high.\n\nIf y_low > y_high: nothing to add.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute y0 = max(y_low, D - x + 1)\n\nif y0 > y_high:\n\n   sum_part1 = sum from y_low to y_high of (x + y - C) → which is sum of x + y - C as y varies.\n\n   sum_part1 = (x + y_low - C + x + y_high - C) * (y_high - y_low + 1) // 2\n\nelse:\n\n   sum_part1 = sum from y_low to y0-1 of (x + y - C)\n\n   sum_part2 = (y_high - y0 + 1) * (D - C + 1)\n\n   sum_total = sum_part1 + sum_part2\n\nThen, add sum_total to the overall count.\n\nNow, the question is, can we compute this quickly?\n\nYes, because for each x, it's O(1) operations after determining y_low, y_high, and y0.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop x from A to B:\n\n   Compute y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\n   y_high = C\n\n   if y_low > y_high: continue\n\n   y0 = max(y_low, D - x + 1)\n\n   if y0 > y_high:\n\n       a = y_low\n\n       b = y_high\n\n       first = x + a - C\n\n       last = x + b - C\n\n       terms = b - a + 1\n\n       sum_part = (first + last) * terms // 2\n\n   else:\n\n       a = y_low\n\n       b = y0 - 1\n\n       first = x + a - C\n\n       last = x + b - C\n\n       terms = b - a + 1\n\n       sum_part = (first + last) * terms // 2\n\n       remaining = y_high - y0 + 1\n\n       sum_part += remaining * (D - C + 1)\n\n   total += sum_part\n\nThis way, for each x, we compute the contribution in O(1) time.\n\nNow, let's see if this works for some examples.\n\nTake the first example: input 1 2 3 4.\n\nSo A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3 - 1 + 1) = max(2, 3) = 3. But y_high is 3. So y can be 3.\n\ny0 = max(3, 4 -1 +1 )= max(3,4) =4. But y_high is 3. So y0 > y_high.\n\nSo sum_part is sum from y=3 to 3: (1+3 -3) =1. So contribution is 1.\n\nWait, but according to the example, x=1 can't form a triangle because z must be >=3, and x + y =1+3=4>3. So z can be 3 or 4.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait for x=1, y=3, then z can be from 3 to min(4, 1+3-1=3). So z can be 3. So the count is 1.\n\nSo in the code above, for x=1, y_low is 3, y_high is 3.\n\ny0 = max(3, 4 - 1 +1) → 4.\n\nSo y0 is 4, which is larger than y_high=3. So case 1 applies.\n\nSum is from a=3 to b=3: x + y - C =1+3-3=1. So sum_part is 1*1 =1.\n\nSo contribution is 1.\n\nNext, x=2.\n\ny_low = max(2, 3-2+1)=max(2,2)=2.\n\ny_high=3.\n\ny0 = max(2, 4-2+1=3).\n\nSo y0=3.\n\nSo case 2: sum from 2 to 2 (y0-1 is 2).\n\nsum_part1: x + 2 -3 = 2-3=-1? No, wait x=2, y=2, C=3.\n\nWait x + y - C is 2+2-3=1.\n\nSo sum_part1 is 1.\n\nsum_part2: y_high - y0 +1 =3-3+1=1. So 1*(4-3+1)=2.\n\nSo total for x=2 is 1+2=3.\n\nSo overall, x=1 contributes 1, x=2 contributes 3, total 4. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the code seems to handle this correctly.\n\nAnother example: Input '1 2 2 5' gives output 3.\n\nSo A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 2 -1 +1)=max(2, 2)=2.\n\ny_high=2.\n\ny0= max(2, 5-1 +1=5). So y0=5>2. Case 1 applies.\n\nsum from y=2 to 2: x+y-C=1+2-2=1. So contribution is 1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low = max(2, 2-2+1=1) → 2.\n\ny_high=2.\n\ny0 = max(2,5-2+1=4). So y0=4>2.\n\nsum from y=2 to 2: x+y-C=2+2-2=2. So contribution is 2.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the output is 3.\n\nWait, what's going on? Because for x=1, y=2, z can be from 2 to min(5,1+2-1=2). So z=2 only. So one triangle.\n\nFor x=2, y=2: z can be from 2 to min(5, 2+2-1=3). So z can be 2,3. So 2 triangles.\n\nSo total 3. Which matches the sample.\n\nBut according to our code, for x=2, y_low=2, y_high=2, y0=4>2.\n\nSo sum_part is (2+2-2) * 1 = (2) *1=2. So x=2 contributes 2.\n\nx=1 contributes 1, total 3. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for this example.\n\nThird example: A=500000, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000.\n\nSo x can only be 500000.\n\ny can be from 500000 to 500000.\n\nSo y=500000.\n\nx + y = 1000000.\n\nSo z must be >=500000, <= D=500000.\n\nAlso, z must be < x + y → z < 1e6.\n\nBut z can only be 5e5.\n\nSo for z=5e5, 5e5 < 1e6 is true.\n\nSo the count is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, considering that A, B, C, D can be up to 5e5, the loop for x can run up to 5e5 times. Each iteration is O(1), so 5e5 iterations are manageable in Python.\n\nSo let's proceed.\n\nImplementing the steps:\n\nRead A, B, C, D from input.\n\nInitialize total =0.\n\nLoop x from A to B:\n\n   y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\n   y_high = C\n\n   if y_low > y_high: continue\n\n   y0 = max(y_low, D - x + 1)\n\n   if y0 > y_high:\n\n       a = y_low\n\n       b = y_high\n\n       first = x + a - C\n\n       last = x + b - C\n\n       terms = b - a + 1\n\n       sum_part = (first + last) * terms // 2\n\n   else:\n\n       a = y_low\n\n       b = y0 -1\n\n       first = x + a - C\n\n       last = x + b - C\n\n       terms = b - a + 1\n\n       sum_part = (first + last) * terms // 2\n\n       remaining = y_high - y0 + 1\n\n       sum_part += remaining * (D - C + 1)\n\n   total += sum_part\n\nFinally, print total.\n\nWait, but in the code, what if C > D? Because the constraints say A<=B<=C<=D. So C can be equal to D.\n\nIn that case, D - C +1 is 1.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nWhat about when D < C? It's impossible because the constraints say C <= D.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nAnother edge case: when x + y -1 < C.\n\nFor example, x=1, y=1, C=3. Then x + y -1 =1, which is less than C=3. So no z's.\n\nSo in this case, y_low = max(B, C -x +1) → if C-x+1 is larger than B, then y starts at that.\n\nBut in this case, x=1, C=3, so C-x+1=3. So y_low is 3, which is higher than y_high=C=3. So no contribution.\n\nThus, the code correctly adds 0.\n\nAnother test case: A=1, B=1, C=1, D=1.\n\nx=1, y can be from 1 to 1.\n\ny_low = max(1, 1-1+1=1) → 1.\n\ny_high=1.\n\ny0 = max(1, 1 -1 +1=1) → 1.\n\nSince y0 <= y_high, case 2 applies.\n\na=1, b=0 → wait, no. Because y0 is 1, so b = y0 -1 =0. But a is 1, which is greater than b=0.\n\nSo in this case, sum_part1 is 0.\n\nsum_part2 is (1-1 +1) * (1-1 +1) =1 *1=1.\n\nSo total is 1.\n\nWhich is correct, since x=1, y=1, z=1 is a valid triangle.\n\nWait, but 1+1>1 is true, so it's a valid triangle.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: x=3, y=3, C=3, D=5.\n\nx + y =6.\n\nSo z can be from 3 to min(5, 5) → 3,4,5.\n\nSo 3 options.\n\nIn code:\n\ny_low = max(B, C -x +1). Suppose B=3, so y_low=3.\n\ny_high=3.\n\ny0 = max(3,5-3+1=3) →3.\n\nCase 2: a=3, b=2 → no terms.\n\nsum_part1 is 0.\n\nsum_part2 is (3-3+1) * (5-3+1) → 1*3=3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: x=2, y=3, C=3, D=4.\n\nx + y =5>3.\n\nz can be from 3 to min(4,5-1=4). So 3,4 → 2 options.\n\nIn code:\n\ny_low = max(B, 3-2+1=2). B is 2, so y_low=2.\n\ny_high=3.\n\ny0 = max(2, 4-2+1=3). So y0=3.\n\nCase 2: a=2, b=2.\n\nsum_part1 = (2+2 -3) =1 → sum is 1*1=1.\n\nsum_part2: 3-3+1=1 → 1*(4-3+1)=2.\n\nTotal 3. But wait, the actual number is 2. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, wait, in this case:\n\nx=2, y=3.\n\nWait no, wait the y ranges are from B to C, which in this case is 2 to 3.\n\nWait, for x=2, y can be 2 or 3.\n\nWait for each y:\n\nWhen y=2: x + y =4>3 → z can be from 3 to min(4,4-1=3). So z can be 3. Count 1.\n\nWhen y=3: x + y=5>3 → z can be 3 and 4. Count 2.\n\nSo total for x=2 is 3.\n\nBut according to the code, for x=2:\n\ny_low =2, y_high=3.\n\ny0 = max(2,4-2+1=3) →3.\n\nCase 2: a=2, b=2.\n\nsum_part1 = (2+2 -3) =1 → sum_part1 is 1.\n\nsum_part2: y_high - y0 +1 =3-3+1=1.\n\nSo sum_part2 is 1*(4-3+1) = 2.\n\nTotal sum_part =3.\n\nSo code correctly counts 3, but according to earlier analysis, it's 3. So why did I think it was 2 earlier? Oh wait, no. Because when y=3, x+y-1=4, which is less than D=4? Or is D included?\n\nWait, z can be up to min(D, x+y-1). So when D=4, x+y-1=4.\n\nSo z can be 3 and 4 → 2 options.\n\nSo the code correctly counts 1 (for y=2) + 2 (for y=3) → 3.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nSo now, time to write the Python code.\n\nRead the four integers A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute the sum as per the algorithm.\n\nHandle cases where A > B, etc., but the problem says A <= B <= C <= D.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nA, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal =0\n\nfor x in range(A, B+1):\n\n    # compute y_low and y_high\n    y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n    y_high = C\n\n    if y_low > y_high:\n        continue\n\n    y0 = max(y_low, D - x + 1)\n\n    if y0 > y_high:\n        a = y_low\n        b = y_high\n        first = x + a - C\n        last = x + b - C\n        terms = b - a + 1\n        sum_part = (first + last) * terms // 2\n    else:\n        a = y_low\n        b = y0 -1\n        if a > b:\n            sum_part = 0\n        else:\n            first = x + a - C\n            last = x + b - C\n            terms = b - a + 1\n            sum_part = (first + last) * terms // 2\n            remaining = y_high - y0 + 1\n            sum_part += remaining * (D - C + 1)\n    total += sum_part\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but in the case where a > b, like when y0 is 1 and y_low is 2, then a =2, b=0, which is invalid. So in that case, sum_part1 is zero.\n\nSo in code, we need to handle that.\n\nSo in the else block, when a > b, set sum_part1 to zero.\n\nSo in code:\n\nif a <= b:\n\n    compute first, last, etc.\n\nelse:\n\n    sum_part1 =0\n\nSo adding that condition.\n\nLet me adjust the code accordingly.\n\nSo, in the else clause:\n\na = y_low\n\nb = y0 -1\n\nif a > b:\n\n    sum_part1 =0\n\nelse:\n\n    compute as before.\n\nSo the code becomes:\n\nif y0 <= y_high:\n\n    a = y_low\n\n    b = y0 -1\n\n    if a > b:\n\n        sum_part1 = 0\n\n    else:\n\n        first = x + a - C\n\n        last = x + b - C\n\n        terms = b - a + 1\n\n        sum_part1 = (first + last) * terms // 2\n\n    remaining = y_high - y0 + 1\n\n    sum_part2 = remaining * (D - C + 1)\n\n    sum_part = sum_part1 + sum_part2\n\nelse:\n\n    ... \n\nWait, but in code, that's handled inside the else.\n\nSo the code is now:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\ntotal =0\n\nfor x in range(A, B+1):\n\n    y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\n    y_high = C\n\n    if y_low > y_high:\n\n        continue\n\n    y0 = max(y_low, D - x + 1)\n\n    if y0 > y_high:\n\n        a = y_low\n\n        b = y_high\n\n        first = x + a - C\n\n        last = x + b - C\n\n        terms = b - a + 1\n\n        sum_part = (first + last) * terms // 2\n\n    else:\n\n        a = y_low\n\n        b = y0 -1\n\n        if a > b:\n\n            sum_part1 = 0\n\n        else:\n\n            first = x + a - C\n\n            last = x + b - C\n\n            terms = b - a + 1\n\n            sum_part1 = (first + last) * terms // 2\n\n        remaining = y_high - y0 + 1\n\n        sum_part2 = remaining * (D - C + 1)\n\n        sum_part = sum_part1 + sum_part2\n\n    total += sum_part\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes, this should handle all cases.\n\nTesting another example: A=2, B=3, C=4, D=5.\n\nPossible x: 2,3.\n\nFor x=2:\n\ny_low = max(3,4-2+1=3) →3.\n\ny_high=4.\n\ny0 = max(3,5-2+1=4).\n\nSo y0=4.\n\nCase 2: a=3, b=3.\n\nsum_part1: x+a - C =2+3-4=1 → terms=1 → sum_part1=1.\n\nsum_part2: y_high - y0 +1=4-4+1=1 → 1*(5-4+1)=2.\n\nTotal for x=2: 3.\n\nFor x=3:\n\ny_low = max(3,4-3+1=2) →3.\n\ny_high=4.\n\ny0 = max(3,5-3+1=3) →3.\n\nCase 2: a=3, b=2 → no sum_part1.\n\nsum_part2: 4-3+1=2 → 2*(5-4+1)=4.\n\nSo x=3 contributes 4.\n\nTotal is 3+4=7.\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nFor x=2, y can be 3,4.\n\ny=3: x + y =5>4 → z can be from 4 to min(5,5-1=4).

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles that can be formed with integer sides \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\) such that \\( A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D \\). A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Given the constraints, we can simplify our check to \\( x + y > z \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Constraints Analysis**: We need to iterate over possible values of \\( x \\) from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\), \\( y \\) from \\( B \\) to \\( C \\), and \\( z \\) from \\( C \\) to \\( D \\). However, directly iterating over all possible values would be too slow, so we use a mathematical approach to optimize the solution.\n2. **Range Calculation for \\( y \\)**: For each \\( x \\), determine the valid range for \\( y \\) such that \\( x + y > C \\). This translates to \\( y \\) starting from \\( \\max(B, C - x + 1) \\) up to \\( C \\).\n3. **Range Calculation for \\( z \\)**: For each valid \\( (x, y) \\) pair, calculate the number of valid \\( z \\) values. If \\( x + y \\leq D \\), all \\( z \\) values from \\( C \\) to \\( x + y - 1 \\) are valid. Otherwise, \\( z \\) ranges from \\( C \\) to \\( D \\).\n4. **Summing Valid Counts Efficiently**: For each \\( x \\), compute the number of valid \\( y \\) values and their contributions to the total count using arithmetic series to avoid nested loops.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nA, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\n\nfor x in range(A, B + 1):\n    y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n    y_high = C\n    \n    if y_low > y_high:\n        continue\n    \n    y0 = max(y_low, D - x + 1)\n    \n    if y0 > y_high:\n        a = y_low\n        b = y_high\n        first = x + a - C\n        last = x + b - C\n        terms = b - a + 1\n        sum_part = (first + last) * terms // 2\n    else:\n        a = y_low\n        b = y0 - 1\n        if a > b:\n            sum_part1 = 0\n        else:\n            first = x + a - C\n            last = x + b - C\n            terms = b - a + 1\n            sum_part1 = (first + last) * terms // 2\n        remaining = y_high - y0 + 1\n        sum_part2 = remaining * (D - C + 1)\n        sum_part = sum_part1 + sum_part2\n    \n    total += sum_part\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input values \\( A, B, C, D \\) are read and parsed.\n- **Loop Over \\( x \\)**: Iterate over each possible value of \\( x \\) from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\).\n- **Determine Valid \\( y \\) Range**: For each \\( x \\), calculate the minimum and maximum values for \\( y \\) such that \\( x + y > C \\).\n- **Calculate Valid \\( z \\) Count**: For each valid \\( y \\), determine how many \\( z \\) values are valid by checking if \\( x + y > z \\).\n- **Efficient Summation**: Use arithmetic series to efficiently sum the counts of valid \\( z \\) values without nested loops.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the valid triangles without iterating over all possible combinations, making the solution feasible even for large input sizes.",
