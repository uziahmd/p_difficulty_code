He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to check if a given string can be formed in a specific way. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem says that the string is built in three steps. First, A creates a string of some 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's. So after this step, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends some 'c's, but the number of 'c's must equal either the number of 'a's or 'b's (or both). \n\nSo, the string must satisfy certain conditions regarding the counts of each character and their order.\n\nLet me think about the steps to verify a given string S:\n\n1. The string must consist of a sequence of 'a's followed by 'b's followed by 'c's. Because each step appends new characters to the end. So, the structure must be aaa...bbb...ccc... without any mixing.\n\nSo the first thing to check is whether the string is strictly increasing in the order a -> b -> c. If there are any 'a's after 'b's or 'c's, or 'b's after 'c's, then it's invalid.\n\n2. After ensuring the order is correct, we need to count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n\n3. Let's denote:\n   - a = number of 'a's\n   - b = number of 'b's\n   - c = number of 'c's\n\nWe know that after B appends, the string has at least 1 a and 1 b. Then C appends c letters, which must be equal to a or b or both.\n\nSo, c must be equal to a or equal to b. But wait, since C appends some letters, c has to be at least 1. Also, the initial a and b are at least 1 each.\n\nAdditionally, the count of 'c's must be equal to either a or b.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's. So, c can be equal to a, or to b, or to both.\n\nWait, no: it's possible for c to be equal to both, like when a == b. So, the condition is that c must be equal to a OR equal to b OR equal to both.\n\nSo, the steps for checking:\n\n- Check the order: all 'a's come first, then 'b's, then 'c's.\n- Count a, b, c.\n- Ensure that c equals a or c equals b.\n\nIf both conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nWait, let's test the example given.\n\nFirst example: 'aaabccc'\n\nStructure: aaaa b cc ... Wait, no, the string is 'aaabccc', which is a a a b c c c.\n\nWait, no: 'aaabccc' is a a a b c c c. So the order is correct.\n\nCounts: a=3, b=1, c=3.\n\nSo c is 3, which equals a (3). So condition holds.\n\nSecond example: 'bbacc' → Wait, the string is 'bba cc'? Wait, 'bbacc' is b b a c c? Oh no, because the 'a' comes after 'b's. So the order is wrong. Hence, it's invalid.\n\nThird example: 'aabc' → a a b c. So order is correct.\n\nCounts: a=2, b=1, c=1. So c is 1, which equals b. So condition holds.\n\nSo the examples match.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: Only a's, but according to problem statement, B appends some b's, so the string can't have just a's. So the input must have at least one a, one b, and one c.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial string is built as A appends a's, then B appends b's, then C appends c's. So the final string must have at least one a, one b, and one c.\n\nSo if the string doesn't have all three, it's invalid.\n\nAnother case: a=1, b=1, c=1.\n\nThen c is 1, which equals a and b. So valid.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=3, c=3. So c equals b. Valid.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=3, c=3. So c equals b. Valid.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b=5, c=5. Valid.\n\nBut what if a=3, b=5, c=4. Then c is neither a nor b. Invalid.\n\nWhat about a=0? No, because A appends some a's",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by a specific sequence of operations involving the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The string must be constructed such that it starts with some number of 'a's, followed by some number of 'b's, and ends with some number of 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must equal either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check the Order**: Ensure the string is strictly in the order of 'a's followed by 'b's, followed by 'c's. This means there should not be any 'a' after a 'b' or 'c', and similarly for 'b's and 'c's.\n2. **Count Characters**: Count the occurrences of each character ('a', 'b', 'c').\n3. **Validate Counts**: Verify that the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. Also, ensure there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check if the string is correctly ordered\nvalid_order = True\nfor i in range(len(s)-1):\n    current = s[i]\n    next_char = s[i+1]\n    if (current == 'a' and next_char != 'a') or \\\n       (current == 'b' and next_char not in ['b', 'c']) or \\\n       (current == 'c'):\n        valid_order = False\n        break\n\nif not valid_order:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    a_count = s.count('a')\n    b_count = s.count('b')\n    c_count = s.count('c')\n\n    # Check if there is at least one of each\n    if a_count < 1 or b_count < 1 or c_count < 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        # Check if c equals a or b\n        if c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The code first ensures that the string follows the correct order of 'a's, 'b's, and then 'c's. If any character appears out of order, the string is immediately deemed invalid.\n2. **Character Counting**: The counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' are determined using the `count` method.\n3. **Validation of Counts**: The code checks if there is at least one of each character and whether the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's. If all conditions are met, the string is valid; otherwise, it is not.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the necessary conditions in linear time relative to the length of the string, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal.",
