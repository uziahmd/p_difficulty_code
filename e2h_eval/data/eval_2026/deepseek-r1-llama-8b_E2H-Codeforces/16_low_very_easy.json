Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a plane with n infinite line roads. Each road is given by the equation a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0. These roads divide the plane into blocks. The home and university are in some blocks, not on any road. I need to find the minimal number of steps to get from home to university. A step is moving from one block to another if they share a border of non-zero length. So, moving through an intersection point doesn't count as a step because their shared boundary is just a point, which has zero length.\n\nHmm, so how do I model this? Well, each road is a line that divides the plane. The blocks are regions separated by these lines. The key idea is that two points are in the same block if they are on the same side of every road. Wait, no—actually, each road can split the plane into two parts. So the arrangement of roads defines a set of regions where each region is determined by whether it's on one side or the other of each road.\n\nWait, but for movement between blocks, it's about how many roads separate the home and university. Because each such road would require crossing, which implies a step. But wait, maybe more than that.\n\nLet me think: the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points. Because each such road would require passing through a boundary between blocks. So if you have k roads that separate the home and university, then you need at least k steps to get from one to the other.\n\nSo the approach is to compute, for each road, whether the home and university are on opposite sides. The count of such roads is the answer.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because each such road contributes a boundary that must be crossed. And since each step can cross multiple roads at once (as long as the path connects through adjacent blocks), the minimal steps are equal to the number of separating roads.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each of the n roads, determine whether the home and university are on opposite sides.\n2. Count the number of such roads.\n3. Output this count.\n\nBut wait, what about when a road doesn't separate them? They are in the same block, so no step needed for that road.\n\nSo the steps are clear. Now, how to implement this.\n\nEach road is a line a*x + b*y + c = 0. For each point (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), plug into the line equation. Compute the value for each point.\n\nIf the signs are different, then the two points are on opposite sides of the line. So for each road, check if (a*x1 + b*y1 + c) and (a*x2 + b*y2 + c) have opposite signs. If yes, increment the count.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward.\n\nNow, handling the computation correctly is important. We need to avoid floating points because of possible precision issues. Instead, we can compute the product of (a*x + b*y + c) for each point. If the product is negative, the two points are on opposite sides.\n\nBecause if (A * B) < 0, then A and B have opposite signs. So for each road, compute A = a_i*x1 + b_i*y1 + c_i, and B = a_i*x2 + b_i*y2 + c_i. If A*B < 0, then the two points are on opposite sides, so this road contributes to the count.\n\nThat's clever because we avoid any issues with zero, but in the problem statement, it's guaranteed that neither home nor university lie on any road, so none of A or B will be zero. So for each road, exactly one of A and B is positive, the other is negative, or vice versa.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\n- Read home coordinates (x1, y1)\n- Read university coordinates (x2, y2)\n- Read n\n- For each of the n roads:\n   - Read a, b, c\n   - Compute A = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n   - Compute B = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n   - If A * B < 0, increment the count.\n- Output the count.\n\nWait, but wait: the sign of A and B depends on the line equation. How does that affect the comparison?\n\nNo, the way I compute A and B is correct. Because for the line equation a*x + b*y + c = 0, the expression a*x + b*y + c equals zero on the line. So for a point not on the line, the sign tells us which side it is on.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nLet me test this logic against the example.\n\nSample Input:\nHome: 1 1\nUniversity: -1 -1\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step allows moving from one block to another if they share a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem can be simplified by recognizing that each road (line) divides the plane into two halves. If two points lie on opposite sides of a road, it means they are in different blocks separated by that road.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each road, check if the home and university are on opposite sides. This can be determined by evaluating the line equation at both points and checking the sign of the result.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Read the coordinates of the home and university.\n   - For each road, compute the value of the line equation at both the home and university coordinates.\n   - If the results have opposite signs, increment the count of separating roads.\n   - The minimum number of steps required is equal to the count of such roads.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The coordinates of home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n- **Evaluating Each Road**: For each road, compute the values of the line equation at the home and university coordinates. If these values have opposite signs, it indicates that the road separates the two points.\n- **Counting Separations**: Each separation by a road contributes to the step count, as crossing each such road is necessary to move between the blocks.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the geometric properties of lines and their impact on dividing the plane into regions.",
