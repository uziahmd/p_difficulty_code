    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on the sides. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem states that Yuri has favorite numbers A, B, C, D where A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. We need to find the number of triangles with integer sides x, y, z such that:\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B  \nB ≤ y ≤ C  \nC ≤ z ≤ D  \n\nAnd also, these sides must satisfy the triangle inequality for a non-degenerate triangle. That means, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since we're dealing with x ≤ y ≤ z (because x is up to B, y is from B onwards, and z is at least C which is ≥ y), the main condition we need to check is x + y > z. Because if x + y > z holds, then automatically the other inequalities will hold since x ≤ y ≤ z.\n\nSo the approach is: iterate through all possible x, y, z in their respective ranges and count those triplets where x + y > z.\n\nBut wait, the ranges can be large—up to 5e5 each. So a brute force approach is impossible. We need an efficient way to calculate this.\n\nHmm, let's think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, note that x ranges from A to B, y from B to C, and z from C to D. Also, since x ≤ B ≤ y, and y ≤ C ≤ z, z is at least as big as C, which is ≥ y, so z is the largest side.\n\nSo for each possible z, we can compute how many (x, y) pairs satisfy x + y > z, x ≤ B, y ≤ C, and x ≤ y.\n\nWait, no. Wait, x can be up to B, but y starts from B. So for each z in [C, D], we can determine the number of (x, y) pairs where x is in [A, B], y is in [max(B, ...), C], and x + y > z.\n\nBut calculating this directly for each z might be manageable, especially since z ranges from C to D.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate z from C to D.\n2. For each z, find the number of (x, y) pairs where:\n   - A ≤ x ≤ B\n   - B ≤ y ≤ C\n   - x ≤ y (since x ≤ B and y ≥ B, but x can be less than or equal to y)\n   - x + y > z\n3. Sum all these counts across all z.\n\nWait, but x can be as low as A, and y as low as B. Also, since x can be up to B and y up to C, but x could be less than y, but since y starts at B and x can be up to B, sometimes x is <= y, sometimes not. Wait no, because x is up to B, and y is >= B. So x can be less than or equal to y, but x can't be larger than y unless x is exactly equal to y.\n\nWait, no. For example, x can be 2 and y can be 3, which is allowed. So the condition x ≤ y is already satisfied because y starts from B and x can go up to B. So in all cases, x ≤ y.\n\nSo, for each z, we need to find the number of (x, y) pairs where x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], x ≤ y, and x + y > z.\n\nWait, but wait: since x can be up to B, and y can be as low as B, but x could be equal to y only when x is B and y is B.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to model this as: for each z, find the number of pairs (x, y) where x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], and x + y > z, and x <= y.\n\nBut since x <= y is always true because y starts from B and x can't exceed B, which is <= y's starting point.\n\nSo the main condition is x + y > z.\n\nNow, how do we compute this efficiently for each z?\n\nLet's think about for a fixed z, the condition x + y > z.\n\nWe can rewrite this as y > z - x.\n\nSince y must be >= B and <= C, and y >= x (but since x can vary, maybe this isn't straightforward).\n\nAlternatively, for each possible x, find the range of y that satisfies y > z - x and y >= max(x, B), y <= C.\n\nWait, but x is fixed, and y needs to be at least B, and at least x (since y >= B >= x's maximum? Not necessarily. Because x can be up to B, and y starts from B. So for x <= B, y can be >= B, which may be >= x.\n\nWait, no. Suppose x is 2, y can be 3 (if B is 2). Then y >= x is true. So for any x in [A, B], and y in [B, C], y is always >= B, and x is <= B. So x can be up to B, but y starts at B. So y can be equal to x (when x = B and y = B), or larger.\n\nThus, for a given x, y must be >= max(B, x) and also >= (z - x + 1) (since y must be > z - x). So for each x, the lower bound of y is the maximum of B and (z - x + 1), and the upper bound is C.\n\nIf the lower bound exceeds the upper bound, then there are no valid y for this x. Otherwise, the count is (upper - lower + 1).\n\nBut for x to contribute, (z - x + 1) must be <= C, and also the lower bound must be <= C.\n\nSo for each z, the total count is the sum over x in [A, B] of the number of y's that satisfy the conditions.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor each z from C to D:\n\n   total_z = 0\n\n   for x in [A, B]:\n\n       lower_y = max(B, z - x + 1)\n\n       if lower_y > C:\n\n           continue\n\n       else:\n\n           count = C - lower_y + 1\n\n           if count < 0:\n\n               continue\n\n           else:\n\n               total_z += count\n\n   add total_z to the overall result.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that when z is up to 5e5, and B can be up to 5e5, this would lead to O(D - C + 1) * (B - A + 1) operations, which could be up to 5e5 * 5e5 = 2.5e11 operations—way too slow.\n\nThat won't work. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about optimizing this.\n\nAlternative approach: For a fixed z, express the condition x + y > z as y > z - x.\n\nBut since x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C, perhaps we can find the range of x where z - x < y_min, where y_min is B.\n\nWait, perhaps we can find the minimal x for which y can be as small as possible.\n\nWait, let's think about the minimal y is B. So for y to be > z - x, we need B > z - x → x > z - B.\n\nSo for x > z - B, y can be B, which is the smallest possible y.\n\nSo, for x > (z - B), the minimal y is B, and x + y = x + B > z → x > z - B.\n\nSo, for x > (z - B), the number of y's is (C - B + 1) since y can be from B to C.\n\nFor x <= (z - B), the minimal y is (z - x + 1). But y has to be >= B and >= x.\n\nWait, but x can be as small as A, and y as small as B. So perhaps we can split the x's into two regions:\n\n1. x ≤ s, where s = z - B.\n\nIn this case, the minimal y is max(B, z - x + 1).\n\n2. x > s, then minimal y is B.\n\nSo for each z, we can compute s = z - B.\n\nThen, for x in [A, min(B, s)], we need to calculate the number of y's >= max(B, z - x + 1) and <= C.\n\nAnd for x in [max(A, s+1), B], the number of y's is C - B + 1, provided that B >= (z - x + 1). Wait, no: for x > s, we have x > z - B → z - x < B → z - x + 1 ≤ B → so y must be >= B, which is the case. So for x > s, any y from B to C will satisfy y > z - x, because y >= B ≥ z - x + 1 → y > z -x.\n\nWait, no: for x > s, z -x < B → z -x + 1 ≤ B.\n\nSo y has to be > z -x → y >= (z -x + 1). But since y >= B and y >= (z -x +1), and since B >= (z -x +1) (because x > z - B → z -x < B → z -x +1 <= B → B >= (z -x +1)), then y must be >= B.\n\nSo for x > s, the minimal y is B, and the count is (C - B + 1), provided that B <= C.\n\nBut what if C < B? No, because in the input, B <= C is given.\n\nSo for x > s, the count is (C - B + 1) if B <= C.\n\nBut wait, C >= B, so yes.\n\nSo for each z, the count can be calculated as:\n\ncount = (number of x in [A, B] where x > s) * (C - B + 1) \n\nplus \n\nthe sum for x in [A, min(s, B)] of max(0, C - max(B, z - x + 1) + 1).\n\nSo this reduces the problem for each z to two parts.\n\nNow, the question is: how to compute this quickly.\n\nLet me define s = z - B.\n\nWe can compute the x's in two intervals:\n\n1. x_low = A to x_high = min(B, s): here, for each x, compute lower_y = max(B, z - x + 1). If lower_y <= C, then the count is C - lower_y + 1. Else 0.\n\n2. x_high = max(A, s + 1) to B: here, count is (C - B + 1) if B <= C.\n\nWait, but if x_high is beyond B, then no contribution.\n\nSo for part 2, the number of x's is max(0, B - x_low_part2 + 1), and each contributes (C - B + 1) as long as B <= C.\n\nWait, but C >= B is given, so that part is safe.\n\nSo now, the problem is to compute the sum over x in [A, min(B, s)] of max(0, C - max(B, z - x + 1) + 1).\n\nThis is manageable if we can find a mathematical formula to compute this sum without iterating each x.\n\nLet me denote for part 1:\n\nfor x in [a, b], where a = A, b = min(B, s):\n\neach x contributes:\n\nif (z - x + 1) > C → 0\n\nelse if (z -x +1) > B → (C - (z - x +1) +1) = C - z + x\n\nelse → (C - B + 1)\n\nSo for each x, the contribution is:\n\nif (z -x +1) > C → 0\n\nelif (z -x +1) > B → C - z + x\n\nelse → C - B + 1\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\ncontribution_x = max(0, min(C, max(z -x + 1, B)) ) - (z -x +1) + 1 ?\n\nWait, no. Let me re-express:\n\nWe have lower_y = max(B, z -x +1).\n\nIf lower_y > C → 0.\n\nElse, the count is C - lower_y + 1.\n\nSo, contribution_x = max(0, C - max(B, z -x +1) + 1 )\n\nWhich can be broken down into:\n\nif max(B, z -x +1) > C → 0\n\nelse → C - max(B, z -x +1) + 1.\n\nSo, for each x, it depends on whether z -x +1 is >= B.\n\nLet me see: z -x +1 >= B → x <= z - B + 1.\n\nWait, z -x +1 >= B → x <= z - B +1.\n\nSo for x <= (z - B + 1), the lower_y is max(B, z -x +1) = z -x +1.\n\nFor x > (z - B +1), the lower_y is B.\n\nSo, within part 1 (x <= min(B, s)), which is x <= min(B, z - B), since s = z - B.\n\nWait, s = z - B.\n\nSo x is in [A, min(B, z - B)].\n\nSo, for x <= (z - B +1) → x <= (s + 1).\n\nBut since x <= s (since s = z - B and x <= min(B, s)), then x is always <= s.\n\nWait, because s = z - B. So x is in [A, min(B, s)].\n\nBut s can be less than B, or equal, or greater.\n\nWait, no: for example, if z is 10, B is 5, then s = 5. So x can be up to min(B, s) = 5.\n\nWait, but z can vary, so s can be negative.\n\nWait, right! Because if z is less than B, then s = z - B is negative. So in that case, x has to be <= s, but s is negative, so x can't be in that range because x is at least A (which is >=1). So for such cases, part 1 doesn't contribute.\n\nSo, to handle all cases:\n\n- For part 1, x is in [A, x_max], where x_max = min(B, s). But if s < A, then x_max is less than A, so no contribution.\n\nSo for part 1, x_max = min(B, s).\n\nBut s = z - B.\n\nSo, for x in [A, x_max], the lower_y is max(B, z -x +1).\n\nBut for x <= s, z -x +1 <= B.\n\nBecause x <= s → x <= z - B → z -x >= B → z -x +1 >= B+1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, s = z - B.\n\nSo x <= s → x <= z - B → z -x >= B → z -x +1 >= B +1.\n\nWait, no: for x = s → x = z - B → z - x = B → z -x +1 = B +1.\n\nSo for x <= s, z -x +1 >= B + 1.\n\nThus, for x in part 1, the lower_y is z -x +1.\n\nSo, for x in part 1, the condition is:\n\nlower_y = z -x +1.\n\nIf this is > C → contribution is 0.\n\nElse, contribution is C - (z -x +1) + 1 = C - z + x.\n\nSo the contribution for x in part 1 is max(0, C - z + x) if z -x +1 <= C.\n\nBut since x is up to min(B, s), which is x <= z - B.\n\nSo z -x is >= B → z -x +1 >= B +1.\n\nWhich implies that lower_y is at least B+1, which is greater than B.\n\nSo for x in part 1, the condition is whether z -x +1 <= C.\n\nSo, for part 1, the x runs from A to x_max.\n\nFor each x in this range, the contribution is C - z + x if z -x +1 <= C.\n\nElse, 0.\n\nSo, the sum for part 1 is the sum of max(0, C - z + x) for x in [A, x_max] where z -x +1 <= C.\n\nLet me define t = C - z.\n\nThen, the condition is x <= z - (t) +1 → x <= (z - t +1).\n\nWait, no: z -x +1 <= C → x >= z - C +1.\n\nWait, solving for x:\n\nz -x +1 <= C → -x <= C - z -1 → x >= z - C +1.\n\nSo, for x >= (z - C +1), the condition holds.\n\nSo, for part 1, x must be in [max(A, z - C +1), x_max].\n\nIf max(A, z - C +1) > x_max → no contribution.\n\nElse, the sum is sum_{x = a}^b (C - z + x), where a = max(A, z - C +1), b = x_max.\n\nWhat's the sum of (C - z +x) from a to b?\n\nIt's sum (C - z) added (b -a +1) times plus sum x from a to b.\n\nSum x from a to b is (b -a +1)*(a + b)/2.\n\nSimilarly, sum (C - z) is (b -a +1)*(C - z).\n\nSo, the sum for part 1 is:\n\nsum_p1 = (C - z) * (b - a +1) + ((a + b) * (b -a +1)) // 2\n\nwhere a = max(A, z - C + 1), b = min(B, s) → s = z - B.\n\nBut wait, s is z - B, and x_max is min(B, s). So if z - B is >= B, then x_max is B. Otherwise, x_max is s.\n\nWait, but for part 1, x is in [A, min(B, s)].\n\nSo, to compute a and b:\n\na = max(A, z - C +1)\n\nb = min(B, s)\n\nIf a > b → part1_sum = 0.\n\nElse:\n\nsum_p1 = (C - z) * (b -a +1) + (a + b) * (b -a +1) // 2\n\nBut wait, what if C - z is negative?\n\nWait, C can be up to 5e5, z can be up to D which is up to 5e5.\n\nSo, for C - z, it can be negative.\n\nBut in that case, for x >= (z - C +1), (C - z) could be negative, leading to (C - z +x) being possibly positive or negative.\n\nWait, but in our condition, for x in part1, x must be >= (z - C +1). So, for each x in part1, the contribution is (C - z +x) if z -x +1 <= C.\n\nSo, if C - z +x is positive, it's added; else, 0.\n\nSo, in cases where C - z is negative, and x is >= (z - C +1), but C - z +x could still be positive or not.\n\nWait, let me take an example.\n\nSuppose z = 5, C = 3. Then C - z = -2.\n\nx is >= (5 -3 +1) = 3.\n\nSo, x >=3.\n\nSo for x=3: C - z +x = 3-5+3=1 → positive.\n\nx=4: 3-5+4=2 → positive.\n\nx=5: 3-5+5=3 → positive.\n\nSo all x >=3 contribute.\n\nBut what if C is 2, z=5.\n\nC - z = -3.\n\nx >=5-2+1=4.\n\nSo x=4: 2-5+4=1 → positive.\n\nx=5: 2-5+5=2 → positive.\n\nx=6: 2-5+6=3 → positive.\n\nSo again, all x in a to b contribute.\n\nWait, what about C=4, z=5.\n\nC-z = -1.\n\nx >=5-4+1=2.\n\nx=2: 4-5+2=1 → positive.\n\nx=3: 4-5+3=2 → positive.\n\nx=4:4-5+4=3 → positive.\n\nx=5:4-5+5=4 → positive.\n\nSo in this case, all x >=2 contribute.\n\nSo, for part 1, the sum is sum_p1 = sum (C - z +x) for x in [a, b], where a is max(A, z - C +1), and b is min(B, s).\n\nBut if C - z is negative, then for x >= (z - C +1), C - z +x could be positive or negative.\n\nWait, but in all the examples above, even when C - z is negative, the sum was adding positive values.\n\nWait, because x >= (z - C +1) → x >= (z - C +1) → z - C +1 <= x.\n\nSo, C - z + x >= C - z + (z - C +1) = 1.\n\nSo, regardless of C - z, for x >= (z - C +1), C - z +x >= 1.\n\nSo, the sum_p1 is the sum of (C - z +x) for x from a to b.\n\nWhich is (C - z) * (b - a +1) + sum x from a to b.\n\nSo, this formula works.\n\nNow, for part 2:\n\nx runs from x_start to B, where x_start = max(A, s + 1), and s = z - B.\n\nWait, s = z - B.\n\nx must be > s → x >= s +1.\n\nBut in part 2, x must also be <= B.\n\nSo, x_start = max(A, s + 1).\n\nBut if x_start > B, then part 2 contributes 0.\n\nOtherwise, the number of x's is B - x_start + 1.\n\nEach x contributes (C - B +1) as long as B <= C.\n\nBut since B <= C is given, yes.\n\nSo, sum_p2 = max(0, B - x_start + 1) * (C - B +1).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFor each z in [C, D], compute s = z - B.\n\nCompute a = max(A, z - C +1)\n\nb = min(B, s)\n\nif a > b: sum_p1 = 0\n\nelse: sum_p1 = (C - z) * (b - a +1) + (a + b) * (b -a +1) // 2\n\nx_start = max(A, s + 1)\n\nif x_start > B: sum_p2 = 0\n\nelse: num_x = B - x_start +1\n\nsum_p2 = num_x * (C - B +1)\n\ntotal_z = sum_p1 + sum_p2\n\nAdd total_z to the result.\n\nBut wait, wait: for part 2, the x must be in [x_start, B], but x must also be <= B.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about the condition for x in part 2: x must be > s.\n\nBecause s = z - B.\n\nSo x must be >= s + 1.\n\nBut x also must be >= A.\n\nSo x_start is the maximum of A and s +1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nresult = 0\n\nfor z in C to D:\n\n    s = z - B\n\n    # Part 1:\n\n    a = max(A, z - C + 1)\n\n    b = min(B, s)\n\n    if a > b:\n\n        sum_p1 = 0\n\n    else:\n\n        n = b - a + 1\n\n        sum_p1 = (C - z) * n + (a + b) * n // 2\n\n    # Part 2:\n\n    x_start = max(A, s + 1)\n\n    if x_start > B:\n\n        sum_p2 = 0\n\n    else:\n\n        n = B - x_start + 1\n\n        sum_p2 = n * (C - B + 1)\n\n    total_z = sum_p1 + sum_p2\n\n    result += total_z\n\nprint(result)\n\nWait, but what about when z is less than A + B? Because then, x + y > z is always true, since x >= A and y >= B.\n\nBut in that case, for all x and y, x + y > z.\n\nSo for such z, the total_z is (B - A +1) * (C - B +1).\n\nBecause x can be from A to B, and y from B to C.\n\nSo, for z where A + B > z: sum_p1 + sum_p2 = (B-A+1)(C-B+1).\n\nBut according to our current code, for such z, what happens?\n\nLet's take z = 5, A=2, B=3, C=4.\n\ns =5-3=2.\n\na = max(2, 5-4+1=2) → 2.\n\nb = min(3,2) →2.\n\nsum_p1: a=2, b=2.\n\nn=1.\n\nsum_p1 = (4-5)*1 + (2+2)*1//2 → (-1)*1 + 4*1/2 → -1 + 2=1.\n\nsum_p2: x_start = max(2, 2+1=3).\n\nx_start=3.\n\nx runs from 3 to 3.\n\nn=1.\n\nsum_p2 = 1*(4-3+1)=2.\n\nTotal_z=1+2=3.\n\nWhich is correct because x can be 2 or 3.\n\nWait, x can be 2 or 3.\n\nFor x=2: y must be >=5-2+1=4. Since y can be 4, so 1 option.\n\nFor x=3: y >=5-3+1=3. y can be 3,4 → 2 options.\n\nSo total 3.\n\nWhich matches the code.\n\nAnother test case: when z is very small.\n\nSay A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nz=3:\n\ns=3-2=1.\n\na= max(1, 3-3+1=1) →1.\n\nb= min(2,1) →1.\n\nsum_p1: (3-3)*1 + (1+1)*1//2 → 0 + 1=1.\n\nsum_p2: x_start = max(1, 1+1=2). So x=2.\n\nn=1.\n\nsum_p2=1*(3-2+1)=2.\n\ntotal_z=3.\n\nWhich is correct because:\n\nx can be 1 or 2.\n\nFor x=1: y must be >=3-1+1=3.
