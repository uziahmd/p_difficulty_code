Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Vanya is trying to balance the sum of his found cards to zero. The problem gives me the number of found cards (n) and the maximum absolute value x on any card. Also, it's given that all the found cards have numbers within -x to x.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find to make the total sum zero. And each of these additional cards can be any integer between -x and x, inclusive.\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should compute the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. We need to make the total sum (S plus the sum of the additional cards) equal to zero. So, the sum of the additional cards must be equal to -S.\n\nBut wait, what if S is already zero? Then no additional cards are needed. That's an easy case.\n\nIf S is not zero, then we need to find some cards whose sum is exactly -S, using as few cards as possible.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: given a target T = -S, what's the minimal number of integers in [-x, x] that add up to T?\n\nWait, but the sum of the additional cards can be any combination of integers from -x to x. How can we find the minimal count?\n\nLet me consider the properties here. Each additional card can contribute at most x towards the target. But since the sum can be negative, maybe using negative values can help.\n\nWait, no. Because the target T could be positive or negative. For example, if T is positive, adding positive numbers will help reach it faster. Similarly for negative T.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal number of cards depends on the absolute value of T and the maximum allowed per card.\n\nSo, the minimal number of cards would be the ceiling of |T| divided by x. Because each card can contribute at most x towards the target.\n\nWait, that makes sense. For example:\n\nIn the first sample input:\n3 2\n-1 1 2\n\nThe sum is (-1 +1 +2) = 2. So T is -2.\n\nThe minimal number of cards is 1, because one card with -2 can achieve it.\n\nIn the second sample input:\n2 3\n-2 -2\n\nSum is -4. So T is 4.\n\nEach card can contribute up to 3. So 4 /3 is 1.333, so we need 2 cards. Because 3*1=3 <4, so 2 cards are needed.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the found cards.\n2. Compute T = -S.\n3. If T is zero, return 0.\n4. Else, compute the minimal number of cards as ceil( |T| / x ), but wait, that's not entirely correct.\n\nWait, no. Because each card can contribute either +x or -x. Wait no, wait: each card can be any integer between -x and x, but when we're trying to reach T, we can choose the best way to do it with minimal cards.\n\nWait, the minimal number of cards is the smallest k such that k * x >= |T|. Because each card can contribute at most x towards the target (in absolute terms). So for example, if T is 5 and x is 3, then 5/3 is 1.666, so we need 2 cards: 3 and 2.\n\nSo the minimal number is the ceiling of |T| / x.\n\nBut wait, let's test this logic.\n\nCase 1: T=2, x=2 → 2/2=1 → 1 card.\n\nCase 2: T=4, x=3 → 4/3=1.333 → ceil is 2 → correct.\n\nAnother case: T=7, x=3 → 7/3=2.333 → 3 cards. Because 3*3=9 ≥7.\n\nBut wait, can we get 7 with 3 cards? Yes: 3+3+1=7. Or even 3+3+1, but that's allowed.\n\nWait, but what about T=6, x=3 → 2 cards (3+3).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold.\n\nBut wait, what if T is negative?\n\nSuppose T is -5, x is 3. Then the minimal number of cards is 2: -3 + (-2) = -5.\n\nWhich is 5 units in absolute value, divided by 3 → 2 cards.\n\nSo yes, the absolute value is taken into account.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Calculate the sum S of the found cards.\n- T = -S.\n- If T is zero, output 0.\n- Else, compute absolute_T = abs(T).\n- minimal",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his found cards equals zero. Each card can have a value between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Sum of Found Cards**: Compute the sum \\( S \\) of the values on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Target Sum**: The target sum \\( T \\) needed from the additional cards is \\(-S\\).\n3. **Check for Zero Sum**: If \\( T \\) is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Compute Minimum Cards**: For non-zero \\( T \\), calculate the absolute value of \\( T \\) and divide by \\( x \\). The result is the ceiling of this division, which gives the minimum number of additional cards required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\ntarget = -s\n\nif target == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    abs_target = abs(target)\n    min_cards = (abs_target + x - 1) // x  # Equivalent to ceiling division\n    print(min_cards)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sum Calculation**: We start by summing the values of the found cards to get \\( S \\).\n- **Target Calculation**: The target \\( T \\) is the negative of this sum, as we need the total sum to be zero.\n- **Zero Check**: If \\( T \\) is zero, the sum is already zero, so no additional cards are needed.\n- **Ceiling Division**: To find the minimum number of cards, we use ceiling division. This ensures that any remainder in the division results in an additional card, as each card can contribute at most \\( x \\) towards the target sum.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of additional cards needed using basic arithmetic operations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
