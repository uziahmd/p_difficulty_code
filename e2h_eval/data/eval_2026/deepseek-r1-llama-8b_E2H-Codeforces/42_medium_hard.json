Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about two progress bars when copying files. Each file is copied one after another in a specific order. The progress bars show the percentage of the current file and the overall percentage of all files copied so far. Both percentages are floored to the nearest integer each time a byte is copied.\n\nI need to find all integers from 0 to 100 inclusive that appear on both progress bars at the same moment during the copying process. Then, output them in increasing order.\n\nHmm. So, for each possible moment when a byte is added (including before any copying starts?), I need to check if the current progress of both bars is the same and within 0-100.\n\nWait, no. The initial state is both at 0%. After each byte is copied, the progress bars update. So each time a byte is processed, we check the current percentages.\n\nSo the approach is: simulate the copying process step by step, tracking both progress bars, and for each step, record the current percentages. Then, collect all the percentages where both bars are equal, and then output those numbers in order.\n\nBut wait, how do I model the process? Because for each file, I'm adding each byte one by one. For example, a file of size 6 bytes would require 6 steps. Each step increases the current count for that file and affects both progress bars.\n\nSo, let's think about the steps:\n\n1. Read n and the list of a_i.\n2. Compute the total sum of all a_i to calculate the overall progress.\n3. Initialize variables:\n   - current_file_index: starts at 0\n   - current_file_pos: starts at 0 for each file as we copy\n   - total_copied: starts at 0\n   - for each file, we'll track how many bytes have been copied so far (like a running total)\n4. For each file, copy each byte one by one:\n   a. For each byte in the current file:\n      i. Increment the total_copied by 1 (since it's one byte)\n      ii. Update the current_file_progress: (current_byte + 1) / a_i * 100, floored\n      iii. Update the overall_progress: (total_copied) / total_sum * 100, floored\n      iv. Check if current_file_progress equals overall_progress. If yes, add this value to the result set.\n5. Also, note that after all bytes are copied, the progress bars might be at 100%, but after that, they stay there. So during the last step, when the last byte is added, the progress bars hit 100% for the current file and possibly 100% overall. But wait, the progress is updated after each byte. So after the last byte is added, the overall progress is 100%, but the current_file_progress is also 100%.\n\nWait, but the progress is computed after each byte. So for the first file, say a_1 has 6 bytes. After each byte, the current_file_progress increases. After the 6th byte, it's 100%. Similarly, the overall progress is (sum of previous files' bytes + current byte) / total_sum *100.\n\nSo, the simulation needs to process each byte one by one, updating the progress bars, and checking for equality.\n\nBut simulating each byte could be computationally heavy if the files are large. However, the constraints say a_i can be up to 1000, and n up to 100. So the maximum number of bytes is 100*1000=1e5, which is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Simulate each byte being copied, for each file in order.\n- For each step, compute current_file_progress and overall_progress.\n- If they are equal, add to the result set.\n- At the end, collect all unique values from the result set, sort them, and print each on a new line.\n\nNow, let's think about how to represent the data.\n\nWe can precompute the total_sum once, which is the sum of all a_i. Then, for each step, we track the current_file's progress and the total progress.\n\nWait, but for each file, the current_file's progress is (current_byte_in_file + 1) / a_i * 100, floored. Because each byte is added one by one. So for the first file, it's a_1 bytes. So the progress for that file is (x)/a_1 *100, floor, where x is the number of bytes copied so far in that file.\n\nSo, during the simulation:\n\nInitialize:\n\ncurrent_file = 0\ncurrent_file_pos = 0\ntotal_copied = 0\n\nfor each file in a:\n    for x in 1 to a[current_file]:\n        current_file_pos += 1\n        current_file_percent = (current_file_pos) * 100 // a[current_file]\n        total_copied += 1\n        overall_percent = (total_copied) * 100 // total_sum\n        if current_file_percent == overall_percent:\n            add to result set\n    current_file +=1\n\nWait, but wait: for each byte, the current_file_percent is based on how many bytes have been copied in that file. So for the x-th byte in the current file, the current_file_percent is (x) * 100 / a_i, floored.\n\nSimilarly, the overall_percent is the total_copied (which is the sum of all bytes so far) divided by total_sum, multiplied by 100, floored.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, during each iteration of x, we compute these two values and see if they're equal.\n\nThis should cover all possible moments when the two progress bars have the same value.\n\nSo now, the code structure is:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the list a as integers.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nIf total_sum is zero? No, because a_i >=1.\n\nInitialize result_set as a set.\n\ncurrent_file = 0\n\ncurrent_file_pos = 0\n\ntotal_copied =0\n\nfor each file in a:\n\n    for x in range(1, file+1):  # since x starts from 1 to a_i\n\n        current_file_pos += 1\n\n        current_file_percent = (current_file_pos * 100) // file_size\n\n        total_copied +=1\n\n        overall_percent = (total_copied * 100) // total_sum\n\n        if current_file_percent == overall_percent:\n\n            result_set.add(current_file_percent)\n\nSo, but wait: when we have multiple files, for example, the second file starts after the first is done. So, for the first file, each byte adds to the total_copied, and the overall_percent is calculated based on that. Then, for the second file, each byte adds to the total_copied, but the current_file_percent is only for the second file.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nOnce all steps are done, collect all the values in the result_set, sort them, and output each on a separate line.\n\nWait, but what about the initial state? At the very beginning, both progress bars are 0. So 0 is included.\n\nIn the code above, when x=0? No, because x starts at 1. So the initial 0 is not captured.\n\nWait, wait. Because before any bytes are copied, the progress bars are 0. So the first step is after the first byte is copied, right?\n\nNo, the problem says: \"after copying each byte.\" So the initial state is 0, but that's before any bytes are copied. So the initial 0 is always present. So we need to include 0 in the result set.\n\nSo, in the code, after processing all the bytes, we should add 0 to the result_set.\n\nWait, or perhaps, during the simulation, the initial state is 0,0. So 0 is definitely in the set.\n\nSo, in the code, after the loop, add 0 to the result_set.\n\nBecause in the example given, the output includes 0 for all cases.\n\nSo, in the code, before the loop, add 0 to the result_set.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the initial state is before the first byte is processed. So, after the first byte is processed, the progress bars are updated. So, the initial state is 0,0, which is considered a moment where both are 0. So, 0 should be included.\n\nSo, in the code, we need to make sure that 0 is added to the result_set.\n\nLet me adjust the code accordingly.\n\nInitialize result_set with 0.\n\nThen, proceed as before.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nresult_set = {0}\n\nThen, for each step, compute and add as needed.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code outline is clear.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\nWait, no, the input is read as n followed by the list of a_i.\n\nWait, the first input line is n, the second line contains the a_i separated by spaces.\n\nSo, for the first test case:\n\nn=1\n\na = [6]\n\ntotal_sum=6.\n\nSimulation:\n\ncurrent_file=0 (file is 6 bytes)\n\nx runs from 1 to 6.\n\nFor each x:\n\ncurrent_file_pos = x\n\ncurrent_file_percent = (x*100)//6\n\ntotal_copied = x\n\noverall_percent = (x*100)//6\n\nSo, for each x, current_file_percent equals overall_percent. So all x from 1 to 6 will have the same value. So during each step, both are equal. So the result_set includes 0, and then 1, 2, ..., 6.\n\nWait, but wait: 6 is 100% when x=6.\n\nSo the result_set after the simulation is {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}.\n\nBut wait, 6 is 100, which is included.\n\nWait, but wait, 6/6 = 1.0, so 100%.\n\nSo in the sample output, the first case's output is '0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100'. Wait, no, the sample output is four lines, each representing a different test case.\n\nWait, looking back, the sample input has four test cases, but the output is four lines, each line being a separate test case's output.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check:\n\nThe sample input shows four lines, each starting with 'n' followed by the a_i. So four test cases.\n\nEach test case's output is a line, like '0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100'—so seven numbers, including 0 and 100.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier logic, the first test case would have all x from 1 to 6, so their percentages would be 0, 16.666… (floored to 16?), wait no—wait, no. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, no. For the first test case:\n\nn=1, a=[6]. So the progress bar for the current file is (x * 100) //6, where x is the number of bytes processed so far in that file. The overall progress is (x *100 )//6.\n\nSo for x=1: 16.666... → 16% for both.\n\nx=2: 33.333 → 33%\n\nx=3: 50% \n\nx=4: 66.666 → 66%\n\nx=5: 83.333 → 83%\n\nx=6: 100%.\n\nSo, the progress bars at each step are:\n\nAfter x=1: 16 vs 16 → include 16.\n\nx=2: 33 vs 33 → include 33.\n\nx=3:50 vs50 → include.\n\nx=4:66 vs66 → include.\n\nx=5:83 vs83 → include.\n\nx=6:100 vs100 → include.\n\nAlso, initial 0 is included.\n\nSo the result_set is {0,16,33,50,66,83,100}, which is the first output line.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code correctly captures this.\n\nAnother sample: second test case.\n\nInput: 2 100 500.\n\nTotal_sum=600.\n\nFile 1: 100 bytes.\n\nFile 2: 500 bytes.\n\nSimulate each byte:\n\nStart with 0 in result_set.\n\nThen, for the first file:\n\nx from 1 to 100.\n\nFor each x:\n\ncurrent_file_percent = (x * 100) // 100 → which is x.\n\noverall_percent = (x * 100) //600.\n\nWait, no: total_copied is x, since each byte increments it.\n\nSo overall_percent = (x * 100) //600.\n\nSo for x=1: 1 vs 0 (since 1*100//600=0). So not equal.\n\nWait, but initial 0 is already in the set.\n\nWait, but when x=1, current_file_percent is 1, overall is 0. So not equal.\n\nOnly when x=100: current is 100, overall is 100 * 100 /600 = 16.666 → 16. So 100 !=16.\n\nSo the first file's progress doesn't match the overall until maybe later steps.\n\nWait, but the second file's processing may create overlaps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think through the steps.\n\nLet me try to manually compute for the second test case.\n\nTest case 2:\n\nn=2\n\na = [100, 500]\n\ntotal_sum=600.\n\nProcess first file: 100 bytes.\n\nFor x from 1 to 100:\n\ncurrent_file_percent is x.\n\noverall_percent is (x * 100) //600.\n\nSo for x=1: 1 vs 0. Not equal.\n\nx=2: 2 vs 0. Not equal.\n\n...\n\nx=96: 96 vs 15 (since 96*100=9600 /600=16 → 16 is the overall after 96 bytes.\n\nWait, 96 * 100 = 9600; 9600 /600=16. So 16. So current_file is 96, overall is 16. Not equal.\n\nx=100: current is 100, overall is 100*100/600=16.666 → 16. So 100 !=16.\n\nSo after the first file is done, the progress bars are 100% for the first file, and 100% overall?\n\nWait, no. Because the overall progress is (100 /600)*100=16.666, floored to 16.\n\nWait, after processing all 100 bytes of the first file, total_copied is 100. So overall_percent is (100 *100)/600=16.666→16.\n\nSo after the first file is done, the current_file is 100% (for that file), and the overall is 16%.\n\nNow, processing the second file: 500 bytes.\n\nFor each x from 1 to 500:\n\ncurrent_file_percent is (x*100) //500 → which is 0, 0, ..., 99, 100.\n\nOverall_percent is (100 + x) *100 //600 → because total_copied is 100 +x.\n\nSo let's see when (x*100//500) == ((100+x)*100//600).\n\nWe can look for x where this is true.\n\nLet's compute some x:\n\nx=1: current is 0, overall is (101*100)/600=16.833→16. So 0 vs16: no.\n\nx=95: current is 19 (95*100/500=19), overall is (195*100)/600=32.5 →32. So 19 !=32.\n\nx=96: 19 vs (196*100)/600=32.666→32. No.\n\nx=97: 19 vs (197*100)/600=32.833→32. No.\n\nx=98: 19 vs 198*100/600=33. So 19 vs33: no.\n\nx=99: 19 vs 199*100/600=33.166→33: no.\n\nx=100: 20 vs (200*100)/600=33.333→33: no.\n\nWait, but perhaps when x=  something else.\n\nWait, perhaps when x=  16.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nAt x= 16 in the second file.\n\ncurrent_file_percent:16*100/500=3.2 →3.\n\noverall_percent: (100+16)*100 /600 = 116*100/600=19.333→19.\n\n3 !=19.\n\nNot matching.\n\nHmm, maybe when x=  25.\n\ncurrent:25*100/500=5.\n\noverall:125*100/600=20.833→20.\n\n5 !=20.\n\nNot matching.\n\nWait, perhaps higher x.\n\nWait, what about x=  300.\n\ncurrent_file_percent:300*100/500=60.\n\noverall_percent: (100+300)*100 /600=400/6=66.666→66.\n\n60 !=66.\n\nNot matching.\n\nWait, perhaps when x=  400.\n\ncurrent:400/500=80.\n\noverall:500/600 →83.333→83.\n\n80 !=83.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps when x=  500.\n\ncurrent:500/500=100.\n\noverall:600/600=100.\n\nSo 100 ==100. So in this step, both are 100.\n\nSo during x=500, we add 100 to the result set.\n\nBut what about other points where they are equal.\n\nWait, maybe earlier steps.\n\nWait, perhaps when x=  240.\n\ncurrent:240/500=48.\n\noverall:340*100/600=56.666→56.\n\n48 !=56.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, perhaps when x=  300.\n\nAs before.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the progress bars cross each other at certain points.\n\nWait, the sample output for this case is:\n\n0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100.\n\nSo 0,95,96,...,100.\n\nWait, 95 is in the output.\n\nSo when does 95% occur.\n\nLooking for x where:\n\ncurrent_file_percent == overall_percent.\n\ncurrent_file is the second file, so (x*100)//500 = 95.\n\nx*100 >= 95*500 → x >=475.\n\nSo x must be at least 475.\n\nAt x=475: 475*100//500=95.\n\noverall_percent is (100+475)*100//600 =575*100/600=57500/600=95.833→95.\n\nSo at x=475, both are 95.\n\nYes, that's why 95 is in the output.\n\nSimilarly, x=476: current is 95, overall is 576*100/600=96. So 95 !=96.\n\nx=475: 95 and 95 → included.\n\nx=  475: added to the result.\n\nSo in this case, 95 is in the result.\n\nSo during the second file's processing, at x=475, 95% is achieved for both.\n\nSo the code correctly captures this.\n\nSo the code should correctly handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nThe steps:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read the next line, split into n integers, store as a list.\n\n3. Compute the total_sum = sum(a).\n\n4. Initialize current_file =0, current_file_pos=0, total_copied=0.\n\n5. Create a result_set, initially containing 0.\n\n6. For each file in a:\n\n    file_size = a[current_file]\n\n    for x in 1 to file_size:\n\n        current_file_pos +=1\n\n        current_percent = (current_file_pos * 100) // file_size\n\n        total_copied +=1\n\n        overall_percent = (total_copied * 100) // total_sum\n\n        if current_percent == overall_percent:\n\n            add to result_set.\n\n    current_file +=1\n\n7. After all steps, collect the sorted list of elements from result_set, each in a separate line.\n\nWait, but in Python, the way to read the input is important.\n\nWait, the input is given as a list of strings, each representing a test case. Or is it a single input?\n\nWait, the problem statement says: the first line is n, the second line is a_1 ... a_n.\n\nBut in the sample input, it's presented as four lines, each being a test case.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is given as four lines, each line being a test case. So for each test case, n is on the first line, followed by a line with a_1 ... a_n.\n\nSo, the code needs to read n test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nSo, in the code, we need to read n test cases.\n\nBut wait, the sample input shows four test cases, each with two lines.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\ntest_cases = []\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    a_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    a_list = list(map(int, a_line.split()))\n\n    test_cases.append(a_list)\n\nThen, for each test case in test_cases, compute the result.\n\nSo, the code should process each test case separately, and for each, output the required line.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nRead n.\n\nFor each of n test cases:\n\n   read n a_i.\n\n   process and compute the result.\n\n   output the result.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    test_cases = []\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n\n        a_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n        a_list = list(map(int, a_line.split()))\n\n        test_cases.append(a_list)\n\n    for a in test_cases:\n\n        total_sum = sum(a)\n\n        res = {0}\n\n        current_file = 0\n\n        current_file_pos = 0\n\n        total_copied = 0\n\n        for file_size in a:\n\n            for x in range(1, file_size +1):\n\n                current_file_pos +=1\n\n                current_p = (current_file_pos * 100) // file_size\n\n                total_copied +=1\n\n                overall_p = (total_copied * 100) // total_sum\n\n                if current_p == overall_p:\n\n                    res.add(current_p)\n\n        # Now, collect the results and sort.\n\n        sorted_res = sorted(res)\n\n        for num in sorted_res:\n\n            print(num)\n\nWait, but wait: in the code above, for each file, we loop x from 1 to file_size, inclusive.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: ['1\\n6'].\n\nIn code, a is [6].\n\ntotal_sum=6.\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent_file=0, file_size=6.\n\nLoop x from 1 to 6.\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent_p =1*100//6=16.\n\noverall_p=1*100//6=16.\n\nEqual, add 16.\n\nx=2: 33 vs 33 → add.\n\nx=3: 50 vs50 → add.\n\nx=4:66 vs66 → add.\n\nx=5:83 vs83 → add.\n\nx=6:100 vs100 → add.\n\nres is {0,16,33,50,66,83,100}.\n\nSorted, it becomes 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\nWhich is the first line of the sample output.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSecond test case in sample input: n=2, a=[100,500].\n\ntotal_sum=600.\n\nProcessing first file (100):\n\nx from 1 to 100.\n\nAt x=100: current_p is 100, overall_p is 100*100//600=16.666→16.\n\nNo match except 0.\n\nThen, process second file (500):\n\nx runs from 1 to 500.\n\nAt x=475:\n\ncurrent_p =475*100//500=95.\n\noverall_p= (100+475)*100//600 =575*100/600=95.833→95.\n\nSo 95 is added.\n\nAt x=500: current_p=100, overall_p= (600)*100//600=100 → added.\n\nOther points where current_p == overall_p include 95, 96, etc.\n\nSo the output for this test case includes 0,95,96,...,100.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle it.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- What about files that have a size of zero? But the problem states a_i >=1, so no.\n\n- What about when total_sum is zero? Impossible as a_i >=1.\n\n- Are all possible equal percentages captured? It seems so.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, a=[1]. So after each byte, current_p is x, and overall_p is x. So all x from 0 to 100 are included except perhaps some.\n\nWait, wait: n=1, a=[1]. So for x=1, current_p=100, overall_p=100.\n\nSo the result_set is {0,1,2,...,100}.\n\nWait, no. Because for each x from 1 to 1, we have current_p=x, overall_p=x.\n\nSo the result_set is {0,1}.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, initial 0 is added.\n\nThen, x runs from 1 to 1:\n\ncurrent_p is 1, overall_p is 1.\n\nSo the result_set is {0,1}.\n\nBut the output expects 0 and 100? Or wait, no.\n\nWait, in the case of n=1 and a=[1], the progress bars for both are the same at every step. So after x=1, the progress is 100% for both.\n\nSo the result_set includes 0,1.\n\nWait, but 1 is 1%, 100% is when x=1.\n\nSo the code would output 0,1.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because in reality, the progress bars after x=1 are 100% for both, so 100% is included.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the code.\n\nBecause in the code, when x=1, current_p is 100, overall_p is 100.\n\nSo in the code, 100 is added to the result_set.\n\nAh, right. Because for the single file, after processing x=1, the current_p is 100, and the overall_p is 100.\n\nSo the result_set is {0, 1, ... ,100}?\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, in the code, for each x in 1..file_size:\n\ncurrent_file_pos is x.\n\ncurrent_p is (x * 100) // file_size.\n\nWhich for file_size=1:\n\nx=1 → current_p is 100.\n\noverall_p is (1 *100) //1 =100.\n\nSo 100 is added.\n\nSo the result_set is {0,100}.\n\nWait, no, because for x=1, the code adds 100.\n\nSo the result_set is {0,100}.\n\nBut in the code, when file_size=1, the loop runs for x in 1..1.\n\nSo in that case, x=1 is processed.\n\ncurrent_file_pos becomes 1.\n\ncurrent_p is 100.\n\noverall_p is 100.\n\nSo 100 is added to the result_set.\n\nSo the result_set is {0,100}.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because during the copying, the progress bars are 0, 100, and that's it.\n\nSo the output should be 0 and 100.\n\nSo the code correctly captures that.\n\nWait, but in the sample input 1, the code returns 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\nSo in the code, when a single file is processed, the result_set includes 0 and 100.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, a=[1,1]. total_sum=2.\n\nProcessing first file (1):\n\nx=1: current_p=100, overall_p=50.\n\nSo not equal except 0.\n\nThen, processing second file (1):\n\nx=1: current_p=100, overall_p=(2 *100)/2=100.\n\nSo 100 is added.\n\nSo the result_set is {0,100}.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, a=[1,1,1].\n\nProcessing each file:\n\nAfter first file, x=1: current_p=100, overall_p=33.333 →33. No.\n\nAfter second file, x=1: current_p=100, overall_p=66.666→66. No.\n\nAfter third file, x=1: current_p=100, overall_p=100. So 100 is added.\n\nSo the result_set is {0,100}.\n\nSo the code correctly outputs these.\n\nAnother edge case: when all a_i are 1. So the progress bars for the current file jump to 100% immediately, and the overall progresses as 1, 2, ..., 100.\n\nSo, for each step:\n\nAfter first file, x=1: current is 100, overall is 50.\n\nAfter second file, x=1: current is 100, overall is 100.\n\nSo during this step, 100 is added.\n\nSo the result_set includes 0 and 100.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, considering all this, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nAnother possible issue is when the same percentage is achieved in multiple steps, but the code uses a set, so duplicates are handled.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the common percentages displayed on two progress bars during the sequential copying of files. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file being copied, while the second progress bar shows the overall percentage of all files copied so far. Both percentages are floored to the nearest integer after each byte is copied.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input:** Read the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Simulation:** Simulate the copying process step by step. For each byte copied, update both progress bars.\n3. **Tracking Progress:** After each byte, compute the current file's progress and the overall progress. Check if these values are equal and record them.\n4. **Result Collection:** Collect all unique percentages where both progress bars show the same value, including the initial 0% state.\n5. **Output:** Print the collected percentages in ascending order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        a_list = list(map(int, a_line.split()))\n        test_cases.append(a_list)\n    \n    for a in test_cases:\n        total_sum = sum(a)\n        res = {0}\n        current_file = 0\n        current_file_pos = 0\n        total_copied = 0\n        \n        for file_size in a:\n            for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n                current_file_pos += 1\n                current_p = (current_file_pos * 100) // file_size\n                total_copied += 1\n                overall_p = (total_copied * 100) // total_sum\n                \n                if current_p == overall_p:\n                    res.add(current_p)\n        \n        sorted_res = sorted(res)\n        for num in sorted_res:\n            print(num)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The code reads the number of files and their sizes from standard input.\n2. **Initialization:** For each test case, initialize variables to track the current file being processed, the position within the current file, and the total number of bytes copied.\n3. **Processing Each File:** For each file, iterate through each byte, updating the progress bars after each byte. Compute the current file's progress and the overall progress.\n4. **Checking Equality:** After each byte, check if the current file's progress matches the overall progress. If they match, add the percentage to the result set.\n5. **Sorting and Outputting:** After processing all files, sort the result set and print each value in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the copying process and tracks the progress bars, ensuring all relevant percentages are captured and outputted correctly.",
