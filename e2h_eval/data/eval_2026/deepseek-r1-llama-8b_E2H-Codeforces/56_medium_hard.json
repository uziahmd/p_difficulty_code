Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve where I need to determine if it's possible to assign Rebel spaceships to bases in such a way that no two paths between them intersect. Hmm, the paths are straight lines from each spaceship to its assigned base.\n\nLet me read the problem again to make sure I understand. We have R rebel ships and B bases. We need a perfect matching—each ship to exactly one base and vice versa. But the crucial part is that any two paths (from ship to base) shouldn't intersect. So the arrangement must be such that when you draw all these straight lines, they don't cross each other.\n\nThe input gives coordinates for the ships and the bases. The output is Yes or No based on whether such an assignment exists.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? I think of it as a graph matching problem but with an added geometric constraint.\n\nWait, maybe I can model this as finding a non-crossing bipartite matching. Because each ship is connected to some base, and the lines shouldn't cross. So perhaps the problem reduces to checking if there's a perfect matching in a bipartite graph where edges represent non-crossing paths.\n\nBut wait, how do I compute if such a matching exists given the positions of the ships and bases?\n\nI remember something about convex hulls and matching. Oh right! If we arrange the ships and bases in certain orders, their connecting lines won't cross. Like, if both ships and bases are ordered along the convex hull, then matching them in order might work.\n\nWait, but not necessarily. There might be cases where a different matching is needed. Hmm, but perhaps the convex hull approach could give us a starting point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be reduced to finding a non-crossing bipartition. So, the key is to find a matching where the order of the ships and bases is such that when connected, the lines don't cross.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution involves the following steps:\n\n1. Sort the ships and bases along their convex hull, maybe in clockwise or counter-clockwise order.\n2. Then, check if the greedy matching (matching the i-th ship to the i-th base in this order) works without any crossings.\n3. If that's possible, then output Yes; otherwise, try another approach or determine it's impossible.\n\nWait, but what if the optimal matching isn't the convex hull-based one? Maybe there's another arrangement that allows a non-crossing perfect matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a standard bipartite matching problem where edges are only allowed if the lines between the ship and base don't cross any others in the matching.\n\nBut considering that R and B are up to 10, which is small, maybe a brute-force approach is feasible. Since 10! is 3.6 million, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but the problem isn't just about any matching—it's about a non-crossing perfect matching. So even if a perfect bipartite matching exists, it might not satisfy the non-crossing condition.\n\nSo the approach needs to account for both the matching and the non-crossing condition.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to model this.\n\nEach possible permutation of assigning ships to bases (since it's a perfect matching) can be considered. For each permutation, I need to check whether all the connecting lines are non-crossing.\n\nBut for R=10, there are 10! = 3.6 million permutations, which is manageable because each permutation's checking can be done quickly.\n\nWait, but for each permutation, how do I check if all the lines are non-crossing?\n\nBecause the lines are between the i-th ship and the j-th base in the permutation. So for each pair of lines, say (ship A to base X) and (ship B to base Y), I need to ensure that these two lines don't cross each other.\n\nSo, for a given permutation, I can iterate through all possible pairs of lines and check if any of them cross. If none do, then that permutation is a valid assignment.\n\nBut wait, checking all possible pairs for each permutation could be computationally heavy. Let me see: for each permutation, the number of line pairs is C(M, 2), where M is the number of ships (equal to B). For M=10, that's 45 checks per permutation.\n\nSo 3.6 million * 45 = about 162 million operations. That's manageable in Python, especially since each operation is simple.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Generate all possible perfect matchings (permutations of B length R, but wait, no: the number of ships and bases must be equal. Wait, the input has R and B. So if R != B, the answer is automatically No. Because we need a perfect matching. So first, check if R == B. Otherwise, output No.\n\nWait, yes! Because the problem says \"R Rebel spaceships\" and \"B bases\"—so for a perfect matching, R must equal B. So the first step is to check if R equals B. If not, output No.\n\nSo in the sample input, the first case has R=3, B=3—okay. The second case has R=2, B=3—so output is No.\n\nSo the first thing is to check if R == B. If not, output No.\n\nNow, assuming R == B, proceed.\n\nThen, generate all possible permutations of the B bases, each permutation representing a possible assignment of ships to bases. Each permutation is a list where the i-th element is the base assigned to the i-th ship.\n\nFor each permutation, check whether all the lines between ships and their assigned bases do not cross each other.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies this, output Yes. Otherwise, output No.\n\nSo now, the key is to efficiently generate all possible permutations and check for the non-crossing condition.\n\nBut wait, generating all permutations is O(R!), which for R=10 is 3.6 million. That's manageable, but perhaps it's better to optimize.\n\nAlternatively, since the order of the permutation is important, perhaps we can find a way to prune the search early if certain conditions are met.\n\nBut for R up to 10, even 3.6 million permutations are acceptable in Python.\n\nSo, the next step is to write code that, given a permutation, can quickly determine if the lines are non-crossing.\n\nHow to check if two lines cross?\n\nTwo lines are defined by two points each: (x1, y1), (x2, y2) and (x3, y3), (x4, y4).\n\nThe lines cross if the points are in a certain order. To determine this, we can use the concept of orientation.\n\nWait, the standard way to check if two line segments AB and CD cross is to compute the orientations of (A, B, C) and (A, B, D), and similarly for the other line. If the orientations differ, the lines may cross.\n\nAlternatively, using the cross product method.\n\nThe idea is: for two line segments AB and CD, they intersect if and only if the points are interleaved in a certain way. \n\nLet me think: for segments AB and CD, they cross if (C is on one side of AB and D is on the other) or vice versa, but also considering the order of the points.\n\nAn efficient way to check this is to compute the orientation of each point relative to the other segment.\n\nThe orientation function can be defined as follows: for three points p, q, r, the orientation is 0 if the three are colinear, positive if counterclockwise, negative if clockwise.\n\nWait, but the problem states that no three points are colinear. So the orientation will never be zero.\n\nSo, for two line segments AB and CD, they cross if and only if:\n\n- The orientation of A,B,C is different from the orientation of A,B,D, and\n\n- The orientation of C,D,A is different from the orientation of C,D,B.\n\nWait, no—that's not correct. Because the line segments may lie on opposite sides of AB and CD, leading to an intersection.\n\nAlternatively, the correct condition is:\n\nSegments AB and CD intersect if and only if:\n\n- Point C is on one side of AB, and D is on the other side, and\n\n- Point A is on one side of CD, and B is on the other side.\n\nWait, perhaps a more precise way is needed.\n\nAnother approach is to use the cross product. For each pair of line segments, compute the direction of the cross products to see if the points are arranged in a way that the lines cross.\n\nWait, let's see. For segments AB and CD, the lines cross if the following is true:\n\n(C is on one side of AB) XOR (D is on one side of AB), and similarly for A and B regarding CD.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look up the algorithm to check if two line segments intersect.\n\nAh, right! The standard method uses the orientation of the segments. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\nTo determine if two line segments AB and CD intersect, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Compute the orientation of A, B, C (O1) and A, B, D (O2). If O1 and O2 are different, then C and D are on opposite sides of AB. Similarly, compute the orientation of C, D, A (O3) and C, D, B (O4). If O3 and O4 are different, then A and B are on opposite sides of CD.\n\n2. If both conditions are true, then the segments AB and CD intersect.\n\nOtherwise, they do not.\n\nWait, but what about the case where one of the segments is entirely contained within the other? Or when the endpoints are the same? But the problem states that no two points coincide, so that's not an issue.\n\nSo, the function to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect can be implemented as follows:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n    # Check if AB intersects CD\n    o1 = orientation(a1, a2, b1)\n    o2 = orientation(a1, a2, b2)\n    o3 = orientation(b1, b2, a1)\n    o4 = orientation(b1, b2, a2)\n\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n    return False\n\nWait, but this might miss some cases. Let me test some examples.\n\nCase 1: Two lines that cross each other. Then, for AB and CD, the orientations would be such that O1 and O2 are different, and O3 and O4 are different. So the function returns True.\n\nCase 2: Segments are parallel and don't intersect. Then, O1 and O2 are same (since AB is a line), and O3 and O4 are same as well. So function returns False.\n\nCase 3: One segment is completely inside the other. For example, AB is a longer line, and CD is inside it. Then, depending on the order, the function may return True or False. Wait, no, because the orientation method should capture that.\n\nWait, let's think: Suppose AB is a horizontal line from (0,0) to (5,0), and CD is a line from (1,1) to (3,1). So, AB and CD don't cross. So the function should return False.\n\nCompute O1 = orientation( (0,0), (5,0), (1,1) ) → positive (since (1,1) is above AB).\nO2 = orientation( (0,0), (5,0), (3,1) ) → positive.\n\nO3 = orientation( (1,1), (3,1), (0,0) ) → negative (since (0,0) is below CD).\nO4 = orientation( (1,1), (3,1), (5,0) ) → negative.\n\nSo o1 != o2? No, both positive. So condition fails. Function returns False. Correct.\n\nAnother case: AB is from (0,0) to (2,2), CD is from (1,1) to (3,3). These are colinear but overlapping. But the problem states that no three points are colinear, so this case doesn't apply.\n\nWait, but in our problem, all points are distinct and no three are colinear, so this situation isn't possible.\n\nAnother test case: AB is from (0,0) to (2,2), CD is from (3,0) to (1,2). Do these cross? Yes, they form an 'X' shape.\n\nCompute O1: orientation of AB and C (3,0). The cross product of vectors AB and AC: AB is (2,2), AC is (3,0). The cross product is (2*0 - 2*3) = -6, which is negative. So O1 is negative.\n\nO2: orientation of AB and D (1,2). Vector AD is (1,2). Cross product is 2*2 - 2*1 = 4-2=2, positive. So O1 and O2 are different.\n\nO3: orientation of CD and A (0,0). CD is from (3,0) to (1,2). Vector CA is (-3,0). The cross product with CD is ( (1-3)*(0-0) - (2-0)*(-3) ) → (-2)*0 - 2*(-3) = 6, which is positive. So O3 is positive.\n\nO4: orientation of CD and B (2,2). Vector CB is (2-1, 2-2) → (1,0). Cross product with CD: ( (1-3)*(2-0) - (2-0)*(1) ) → (-2)*2 - 2*1 → -4 -2 = -6. Negative. So O3 and O4 are different.\n\nSo function returns True, which is correct.\n\nSo, this function seems to correctly identify crossing segments.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read R and B. If R != B, output No.\n\n- Read R ship coordinates and B base coordinates.\n\n- Generate all possible permutations of the B bases.\n\n- For each permutation, create a list of assignments: ship 0 → perm[0], ship 1 → perm[1], etc.\n\n- For this assignment, check all possible pairs of segments (ship i to base j and ship k to base l) to see if any of them cross.\n\nWait, but for a permutation, each ship is connected to exactly one base. So, for the permutation, the assignment is a bijection. So, for each pair of ships i and k, and their assigned bases j and l, we need to check if the segments (i,j) and (k,l) cross.\n\nWait, no, because it's not just pairs of any two ships. Each ship is connected to exactly one base, so for each pair of segments, they are from different ships to their respective bases. So, for all i < k, we need to check if the segments (ship i to base j) and (ship k to base l) cross.\n\nBut wait, the permutation assigns each ship to a unique base. So for each pair of segments (i,j) and (k,l), where j and l are assigned to i and k respectively, we need to check if they cross.\n\nWait, but for a given permutation, each ship is assigned to exactly one base, so the segments are all independent. So, for the entire permutation, we need to check all possible pairs of segments in the assignment to see if any cross.\n\nBut that could be time-consuming. For R=10, the number of pairs is 45 per permutation, which is manageable.\n\nSo, for each permutation:\n\n   For each pair of segments s1 and s2 in the permutation:\n\n      Check if s1 and s2 cross.\n\n      If any pair crosses, mark this permutation as invalid and break.\n\nIf all pairs are non-crossing, then this permutation is a valid assignment. So, return 'Yes'.\n\nIf after checking all permutations, none are valid, return 'No'.\n\nSo, the code structure would be something like this:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B: print 'No' and exit.\n\nRead R ship points into a list ships.\n\nRead B base points into a list bases.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the bases.\n\nFor each permutation in the permutations:\n\n   Create a list of (ship i, base j) pairs, where j is the i-th element of the permutation.\n\n   For all i from 0 to R-1:\n\n      for all j from i+1 to R-1:\n\n          get the two segments: s1 is (ships[i], permutation[i]), s2 is (ships[j], permutation[j]).\n\n          check if s1 and s2 cross.\n\n          if yes, permutation is invalid, break.\n\n   If permutation is valid, return 'Yes'.\n\nAfter all permutations, return 'No'.\n\nWait, but wait. The permutation represents the assignment of the ships to the bases in order. So for the permutation [b0, b1, b2], ship 0 is assigned to b0, ship 1 to b1, etc.\n\nThus, for the permutation, the segments are ship0→b0, ship1→b1, ship2→b2.\n\nSo, for each pair of segments (i, j) where i < j, we need to check whether ship_i→b_i and ship_j→b_j cross.\n\nWait, no—because the permutation is a specific assignment. So, the segments are from each ship to their assigned base.\n\nBut to check all possible pairs of segments in the assignment, including those that cross.\n\nYes, because any pair of segments could potentially cross. So, for all i < j, check if segment i and j cross.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor perm in permutations(bases):\n\n    valid = True\n\n    for i in range(R):\n\n        for j in range(i+1, R):\n\n            ship_i = ships[i]\n\n            base_i = perm[i]\n\n            ship_j = ships[j]\n\n            base_j = perm[j]\n\n            if segments_intersect(ship_i, base_i, ship_j, base_j):\n\n                valid = False\n\n                break\n\n        if not valid:\n\n            break\n\n    if valid:\n\n        print(\"Yes\")\n\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"No\")\n\nWait, but this seems a bit off. Because in the permutation, each ship is assigned to a base, but the way the permutation is generated, the base indices are fixed. So, for the permutation, the i-th element is the base assigned to the i-th ship.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input:\n\nShips are at (0,0), (2,0), (3,1).\n\nBases are at (2,2), (3,1), (0,3).\n\nOne possible permutation is [2, 1, 0], but wait, the actual permutation is based on the indices. Wait, no—the permutation is a rearrangement of the base indices.\n\nWait, the permutation is a list of base indices, but perhaps I should represent it as a list of base points. Or, perhaps, the permutation is a list where the i-th position is the index of the base in the original list.\n\nWait, maybe not. It's better to think of the permutation as a list where the i-th element is the index of the base in the original list. So, for example, if the original base list is [base0, base1, base2], a permutation could be [2, 0, 1], meaning ship0 is assigned to base2, ship1 to base0, ship2 to base1.\n\nThus, in code, for each permutation, the i-th ship is assigned to the perm[i]-th base in the original list.\n\nWait, no. The permutation is a list of the base indices, not the base objects. So, for each permutation, the i-th element is the index of the base in the original list.\n\nSo, for example, if the original bases are [base0, base1, base2], a permutation could be [2, 0, 1], which means ship0 is assigned to base2, ship1 to base0, ship2 to base1.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nbases = [ ... ]  # list of tuples, each is a base point.\n\nperm is a tuple of integers, each between 0 and B-1.\n\nSo, for each i in 0..R-1:\n\n    assigned_base = bases[perm[i]]\n\nThus, the segments are from ships[i] to bases[perm[i]] for each i.\n\nSo, in the code, for each permutation, we need to generate all possible pairs of segments and check for intersections.\n\nWait, but the way I thought earlier is to have ship0 assigned to perm[0], ship1 to perm[1], etc. So, for each pair (i, j) where i < j, check if the segments from ships[i] to bases[perm[i]] and ships[j] to bases[perm[j]] cross.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nimport itertools\n\nR, B = map(int, input().split())\n\nships = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(R)]\n\nbases = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(B)]\n\nif R != B:\n\n    print(\"No\")\n\n    exit()\n\n# Now generate all possible permutations of the bases (as indexes)\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nall_perms = permutations(range(B))\n\nfound = False\n\nfor perm in all_perms:\n\n    valid = True\n\n    for i in range(R):\n\n        for j in range(i+1, R):\n\n            # Get the i-th and j-th ships and their assigned bases\n\n            s_i = ships[i]\n\n            b_i = bases[perm[i]]\n\n            s_j = ships[j]\n\n            b_j = bases[perm[j]]\n\n            if segments_intersect(s_i, b_i, s_j, b_j):\n\n                valid = False\n\n                break\n\n        if not valid:\n\n            break\n\n    if valid:\n\n        found = True\n\n        break\n\nprint(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nWait, but wait. The permutations are of the indices of the bases, not the actual points. So, for each permutation, the i-th element is the index of the base point to assign to the i-th ship.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, the permutation is over the base indices, so for each i, the assigned base is bases[perm[i]].\n\nYes.\n\nBut now, the function segments_intersect needs to take four arguments: two points for the first segment, and two for the second.\n\nSo, let's implement that function.\n\nImplementing the orientation function:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n\n    val = (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - q[0]) - (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - q[1])\n\n    if val == 0:\n\n        return 0  # colinear, but according to problem statement, this can't happen.\n\n    return 1 if val > 0 else -1\n\nThen, the segments_intersect function:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n\n    # Check if AB and CD intersect.\n\n    o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n\n    o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n\n    o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n\n    o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but in the code, for each i and j, we have segments (ships[i], bases[perm[i]]) and (ships[j], bases[perm[j]]).\n\nWait, but for i < j, it's possible that the segments cross each other. So, in the code, for each pair of segments (i,j) where i < j, we need to check if they cross.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nThen, the bases are:\n\n(3,1), (-2,1), (0,3), (2,2). Wait, wait, no, the input for the bases is three lines:\n\nIn the first sample input, the bases are:\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\nWait, but wait, the input after the ships is three lines, each being a base coordinate. So, the bases list is [ (3,1), (-2,1), (0,3) ].\n\nWait, but the sample input as written in the problem statement is:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, I think I miscounted. The first line is R and B. Then R lines for ships, then B lines for bases.\n\nSo, for the first sample, R=3, B=3.\n\nShips are:\n\n0 0 → (0,0)\n\n2 0 → (2,0)\n\n3 1 → (3,1)\n\nBases are:\n\n3 1 → (3,1)\n\n-2 1 → (-2,1)\n\n0 3 → (0,3)\n\nWait, but in the sample input description, the first line is:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, perhaps the first string is the entire input, but that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the sample input is:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nBut wait, that can't be because the bases are 3 lines. Wait, perhaps the first string is the input, split into lines. So, the first line is '3 3', then the next three lines are the ships, then the next three lines are the bases.\n\nSo, the ships are:\n\n(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)\n\nbases are:\n\n(3,1), (-2,1), (0,3)\n\nWait, no—because in the input, after the first line (3 3), there are R=3 lines for ships, then B=3 lines for bases. So, the bases are:\n\nLine 4: 3 1 → (3,1)\n\nLine 5: -2 1 → (-2,1)\n\nLine 6: 0 3 → (0,3)\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the output is 'Yes' because a certain permutation works. For example, the permutation [2, 0, 1], meaning ship0 → base2 (0,3), ship1 → base0 (3,1), ship2 → base1 (-2,1). So, the segments are:\n\nShip0 (0,0) → (0,3): a vertical line.\n\nShip1 (2,0) → (3,1): a line from (2,0) to (3,1).\n\nShip2 (3,1) → (-2,1): a line from (3,1) to (-2,1).\n\nDo any of these cross?\n\nCheck between ship0 and ship1: segment from (0,0) to (3,1) and (2,0) to (0,3). Do they cross?\n\nWait, I'm not sure. Let me calculate.\n\nWait, ship0 is (0,0), assigned to (0,3). So segment is from (0,0) to (0,3)—a vertical line.\n\nShip1 is (2,0), assigned to (3,1). Segment is from (2,0) to (3,1).\n\nDo these cross? Well, the vertical line x=0 and the segment from (2,0) to (3,1). They don't cross because the vertical line is at x=0 and the other segment is at x>2.\n\nWhat about ship1 and ship2's segments: (2,0)→(3,1) and (3,1)→(-2,1).\n\nThese two lines: from (2,0) to (3,1) and from (3,1) to (-2,1). These two lines meet at (3,1), so they don't cross except at that point.\n\nShip0's segment is (0,0)→(0,3). Ship2's segment is (3,1)→(-2,1). These are two lines that don't cross.\n\nSo, in this permutation, no segments cross. Hence, the output is 'Yes'.\n\nSo the code should find this permutation and return 'Yes'.\n\nIn the code, when generating permutations, it's possible that this permutation is one of the possibilities.\n\nSo, the code would process this permutation and check all pairs.\n\nWait, but in the code, for each permutation, it's checking all i < j pairs.\n\nIn this permutation, for i=0, j=1: segments (0,0)→(0,3) and (2,0)→(3,1). Do these cross? Let's compute.\n\nCompute orientation for the first segment (0,0)-(0,3) and point (2,0). The orientation is (0-0, 3-0) × (2-0, 0-0) → (0,3) × (2,0) → determinant is 0*0 -3*2 = -6. So orientation is negative.\n\nOrientation for (0,0)-(0,3) and (3,1): determinant is 0*1 - 3*3 = -9 → negative.\n\nSo o1 == o2, so no crossing.\n\nNext, i=0, j=2: segments (0,0)→(0,3) and (3,1)→(-2,1). Do they cross?\n\nThe segment (3,1)→(-2,1) is a horizontal line at y=1.\n\nThe segment (0,0)→(0,3) is vertical. They don't cross.\n\ni=1, j=2: segments (2,0)→(3,1) and (3,1)→(-2,1). Do they cross?\n\nThey share the point (3,1), but the segments are from (2,0) to (3,1) and from (3,1) to (-2,1). So, they meet at (3,1) but don't cross elsewhere. So, no crossing.\n\nHence, this permutation is valid, so the code will find it and output 'Yes'.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about the second sample input?\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 1\n\nShip coordinates:\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\nBase coordinates:\n\n3 1\n\nSo, R=2, B=1. So R != B, so output is 'No'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: R=1, B=1. Then, the single ship is assigned to the single base. No segments to check, so output is 'Yes'.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2.\n\nShips at (0,0), (2,2).\n\nBases at (1,0), (3,0).\n\nPossible permutation: ship0 → base0 (1,0), ship1 → base1 (3,0).\n\nSegments are (0,0)→(1,0) and (2,2)→(3,0). These lines are y=0 and y=-x+4. They cross at (1,0) and (3,0) is on the same line. Wait, no—segments are from (0,0) to (1,0) (which is a horizontal line on y=0) and from (2,2) to (3,0) (a line that goes down to the right). Do these cross?\n\nThe segment (2,2)-(3,0) is a line with slope -1.\n\nThe line y=0 is the x-axis.\n\nThe segment (2,2)-(3,0) crosses the x-axis at (3,0), but the other segment ends at (1,0). So, the two segments are (0,0)-(1,0) and (2,2)-(3,0). Do they cross?\n\nWell, the line (2,2)-(3,0) is a straight line that goes from (2,2) to (3,0), passing through (2.5,1). The segment (0,0)-(1,0) is on the x-axis from 0 to 1. The line (2,2)-(3,0) doesn't cross this segment.\n\nWait, but (3,0) is beyond (1,0). So, the two segments are on the same line y=0, but from (0,0) to (1,0), and (2,2) to (3,0). So, they share a common point at (0,0) and (3,0)? No, (0,0) is not on the second segment.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me compute.\n\nThe segment (0,0) to (1,0) is along y=0.\n\nThe segment (2,2) to (3,0) has equation y = -x +4.\n\nThese two lines intersect at (0,0) because plugging x=0 into y= -x +4 gives y=4, which is not 0. Wait, no, (0,0) is not on the line y=-x+4 because when x=0, y=4. So, the lines are different.\n\nWait, the segment (2,2) to (3,0) is a straight line from (2,2) to (3,0). This line does not pass through (0,0). So, the two segments (0,0)-(1,0) and (2,2)-(3,0) do not cross.\n\nWait, but in the code, when i=0 and j=1, it's checking the segments (0,0)-(1,0) and (2,2)-(3,0). Do they cross?\n\nWe can compute orientation.\n\nCompute orientation for (0,0)-(1,0) and (2,2):\n\no1 = orientation((0,0), (1,0), (2,2)).\n\nThe vector from (0,0) to (1,0) is (1,0). The vector from (0,0) to (2,2) is (2,2). The cross product is (1*2 - 0*2) = 2. Positive → o1 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, o2 = orientation((0,0), (1,0), (3,0)) → cross product is 1*0 - 0*3 = 0 → but the problem states no three points are colinear. So, this case is not possible.\n\nWait, in this test case, the two segments are on the same line (y=0). But the problem statement says no three points are colinear. So, this test case is invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps I should choose another test case where two segments do cross.\n\nLet me think of a case where R=2, B=2.\n\nShips at (0,0) and (2,2).\n\nBases at (1,1) and (3,3).\n\nSo, possible permutations are:\n\n[0,1]: ship0 → base0 (1,1), ship1 → base1 (3,3). Segments are (0,0)-(1,1) and (2,2)-(3,3). These are two lines that are colinear and parallel, so they don't cross.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says no three points are colinear, but in this case, the two segments are part of the same line, but their endpoints are different. So, in this case, the two segments are on the same line but don't cross.\n\nAnother permutation: [1,0]. ship0 → (3,3), ship1 → (1,1). Segments are (0,0)-(3,3) and (2,2)-(1,1). These two segments cross at (1,1) and (2,2), but wait, the segments are from (0,0) to (3,3) and (2,2) to (1,1). They are parts of the same line, so they don't cross.\n\nWait, maybe I need a case where two segments cross.\n\nLet me think of R=2, B=2.\n\nShips at (0,0) and (2,0).\n\nBases at (1,1) and (1,-1).\n\nSo, the two ships are on the x-axis, and the bases are above and below.\n\nPermutation 0,1: ship0→ (1,1), ship1→ (1,-1).\n\nThe segments are (0,0)-(1,1) and (2,0)-(1,-1). Do these cross?\n\nThe line (0,0)-(1,1) is y=x.\n\nThe line (2,0)-(1,-1) is y = (-x) -1.\n\nThese two lines cross at (0, -1), which is outside the segments.\n\nWait, the segments are from (0,0) to (1,1) and (2,0) to (1,-1). Let's see if these cross.\n\nUsing the orientation function:\n\nFor segment (0,0)-(1,1) and point (2,0):\n\nThe orientation is (1-0)(0-0) - (0-0)(2-1) → 1*0 - 0*1 = 0. So, o1 is 0, but the problem states that no three points are colinear, so this case is invalid.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need a different setup.\n\nLet me try:\n\nShips at (0,0) and (2,2).\n\nBases at (1,0) and (1,2).\n\nSo, permutation [0,1]: ship0→(1,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to assign Rebel spaceships to bases such that no two paths from a spaceship to its assigned base intersect. This problem can be approached by checking all possible perfect matchings and verifying if any of them result in non-crossing paths.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires a perfect matching between spaceships and bases where the connecting paths do not intersect. This is a geometric problem that can be translated into checking for non-crossing segments in a bipartite graph.\n2. **Convex Hull Insight**: Sorting points along their convex hull can help in checking non-crossing conditions efficiently, but we will use a brute-force approach given the small input size (R and B up to 10).\n3. **Brute-force with Permutations**: Generate all permutations of base assignments for the spaceships. For each permutation, check if all connecting segments are non-crossing.\n4. **Orientation Check**: Use orientation to determine if two line segments intersect. The orientation helps in deciding if points are on the same side or different sides of a line segment.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - q[0]) - (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - q[1])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0  # colinear, but according to problem statement, this can't happen\n    return 1 if val > 0 else -1\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n    o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n    o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n    o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n    return (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    R = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    B = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    \n    ships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x = int(input[idx])\n        y = int(input[idx+1])\n        ships.append((x, y))\n        idx += 2\n    \n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x = int(input[idx])\n        y = int(input[idx+1])\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        idx += 2\n    \n    found = False\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(range(B)):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                s_i = ships[i]\n                b_i = bases[perm[i]]\n                s_j = ships[j]\n                b_j = bases[perm[j]]\n                if segments_intersect(s_i, b_i, s_j, b_j):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            found = True\n            break\n    \n    print(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into spaceship and base coordinates.\n2. **Perfect Matching Check**: If the number of spaceships (R) does not equal the number of bases (B), output \"No\".\n3. **Permutations Generation**: Generate all possible permutations of base indices to represent potential assignments.\n4. **Non-crossing Check**: For each permutation, check if any segments between spaceships and their assigned bases cross using the orientation method.\n5. **Output Result**: If any permutation results in non-crossing segments, print \"Yes\". If none do, print \"No\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible assignments are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and orientation checks to validate the non-crossing condition.",
