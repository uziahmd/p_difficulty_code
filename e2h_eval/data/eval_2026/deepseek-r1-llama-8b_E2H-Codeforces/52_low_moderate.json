Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Vasily has some candles and can make new ones from the stubs. The goal is to calculate the maximum number of hours he can keep the room lit. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nHmm, the problem says that each candle burns for one hour and then goes out. But when you have b stubs, you can make a new candle. So it's like, every time you collect enough stubs, you can create more candles and burn them, which in turn gives more stubs.\n\nLet me think about the example they gave. For 4 candles and b=2: initially, 4 hours. After burning all 4, he has 4 stubs. He can make 4//2=2 new candles. Burn those, which takes 2 hours, adding 2 to the total. Now he has 2 stubs (from those two) plus the remaining 0 from the initial 4 minus 4 (wait, no, wait). Wait, after making 2 new candles, he uses them, so their stubs are added to his collection. So after the first 4, he has 4 stubs. He makes 2, burns them, so adds 2 stubs. Now he has 4 - 4 + 2 = 2 stubs? Or wait, maybe I should model it as a loop where each step is:\n\n- Total hours start with a.\n- While the number of stubs is >= b:\n   - Create new_candles = stubs // b\n   - Add new_candles to the total hours.\n   - stubs = (stubs % b) + new_candles (since each new candle, when burned, produces another stub)\n\nSo for the first example, a=4, b=2:\n\nhours = 4\nstubs =4\n4 >=2, so new =2, hours +=2 → 6. stubs now =4%2=0 +2=2.\nAgain, 2>=2 → new=1, hours=7. stubs=0+1=1. Now 1 <2, so stop.\n\nYes, that matches the example.\n\nAnother example: input 6 3.\n\nInitial hours=6, stubs=6.\n\n6 >=3 → new=2, hours=8, stubs=0+2=2. 2<3, so stop. So output is 8.\n\nWait, but what if stubs can be increased multiple times beyond just once?\n\nLike, suppose a=5, b=3.\n\nInitial a=5, stubs=5.\n\nFirst iteration: 5//3=1, hours=6, stubs=5%3=2 +1=3.\n\nSecond iteration: 3//3=1, hours=7, stubs=0+1=1. 1 <3. Stop.\n\nTotal is 7.\n\nSo the algorithm is: while stubs >=b, do:\n\nnew_candles = stubs //b\n\nadd new_candles to hours.\n\nstubs = (stubs %b) + new_candles.\n\nSo the steps are clear.\n\nNow, the code needs to read a and b from input, compute this, and print the result.\n\nHow to handle the input? Since the input is given as a single line with two integers, perhaps split the input into a list, then map to integers.\n\nIn Python, something like:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, initialize hours =a.\n\nstubs =a.\n\nThen loop:\n\nwhile stubs >=b:\n\n    new = stubs // b\n\n    hours += new\n\n    stubs = stubs % b + new\n\nContinue until stubs <b.\n\nFinally, print(hours).\n\nWait, but what about cases where b is 1? Oh, but according to the problem statement, b is at least 2. So no problem there.\n\nTesting the examples:\n\nTest case 1: a=4, b=2.\n\nLoop:\n\nstubs=4 >=2: new=2, hours=6. stubs=0+2=2.\n\nLoop again: stubs=2 >=2: new=1, hours=7. stubs=0+1=1.\n\nLoop ends. Output is 7.\n\nTest case 2: a=6, b=3.\n\nstubs=6 >=3: new=2, hours=8. stubs=0+2=2.\n\nLoop ends. Output 8.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=3.\n\nhours=5, stubs=5.\n\n5//3=1 → hours 6, stubs=5%3=2 +1=3.\n\nLoop again: 3//3=1 → hours 7, stubs=0+1=1.\n\nNo more loops. Output 7.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the given candles and the ability to create new candles from the stubs of burned-out ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles `a` which can burn for `a` hours.\n2. **Stub Collection**: After burning all initial candles, collect the stubs. Each candle that burns out produces a stub.\n3. **Recycling Stubs**: Use the collected stubs to create new candles. For every `b` stubs, you can create one new candle. This process continues until the number of stubs is less than `b`.\n4. **Iterative Process**: In each iteration, calculate how many new candles can be made from the current stubs. Burn these new candles, add the time they provide to the total hours, and update the stub count with the remaining stubs plus any new stubs from the newly burned candles.\n5. **Termination Condition**: Stop the process when the number of stubs is less than `b`, as no more new candles can be made.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nhours = a\nstubs = a\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new_candles = stubs // b\n    hours += new_candles\n    stubs = stubs % b + new_candles\n\nprint(hours)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the values of `a` (initial candles) and `b` (number of stubs needed to make a new candle).\n- **Initial Hours Calculation**: The initial number of hours is set to `a` because each candle burns for exactly one hour.\n- **Loop for Recycling Stubs**: The loop continues as long as there are enough stubs to make at least one new candle. In each iteration, it calculates how many new candles can be made, adds the corresponding hours to the total, and updates the stub count.\n- **Output the Result**: Once the loop terminates, the total number of hours is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently recycles stubs to maximize the illumination time, ensuring optimal use of resources.",
