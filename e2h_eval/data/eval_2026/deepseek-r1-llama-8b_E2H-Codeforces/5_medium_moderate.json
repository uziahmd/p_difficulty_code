Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Hmm, let's see. The problem says that each left boot can be paired with a right boot if their colors are compatible. Two colors are compatible if they are the same or one is a question mark. Oh right, because a question mark is compatible with any color.\n\nThe goal is to maximize the number of pairs, and then output those pairs along with the count. Also, each boot can be in at most one pair.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. So, for each left boot, I can pair it with a right boot if their colors are compatible. But since each can only be used once, I need to find a matching between left and right boots such that as many pairs as possible are made without overlapping.\n\nWait, but how do I efficiently find which pairs to choose to maximize the total? Because trying all possibilities is impossible given n can be up to 150,000.\n\nHmm, maybe we can model this as a bipartite graph where lefts are on one side and rights on the other, edges exist when compatible. Then the problem reduces to finding the maximum matching in this graph. But wait, maximum bipartite matching for n=150k is computationally heavy if done naively. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a way to compute the maximum matching without explicitly building the graph. Let's think about the counts of each color in left and right, including the question marks.\n\nFor example, for each specific character c (excluding '?'), the number of lefts with c is l_count[c], and the number of rights with c is r_count[c]. The maximum possible pairs for c is the minimum of these two. For the question marks, the number of pairs is the number of left ? plus the number of right ?, but that's not quite accurate because a left ? can pair with any right, including specific ones. Wait, no: a left ? can pair with any right (since right could be ? or specific). Similarly, a right ? can pair with any left.\n\nBut maybe it's better to precompute for each left and right what's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal strategy is to:\n\n1. Pair as many specific-same pairs as possible.\n2. Then use the remaining left and right ? to form as many possible pairs.\n\nWait, but perhaps pairing some specific pairs may block more options than others. Maybe we should prioritize certain specific pairs first.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach:\n\n- For each color c (a-z), compute the minimum of the number of lefts with c and the number of rights with c. Summing these gives the base number of specific pairs.\n\n- Then, for the question marks, the number of possible pairs is the sum of left ? and right ?. But wait, no— because each left ? can pair with any right, including specific ones, but those specific rights may already be paired with lefts of the same color.\n\nHmm, maybe the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the number of specific pairs for each color, add to the total.\n\n2. Then, for the remaining left and right boots, calculate how many can form ? pairs. But this might not be straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the problem as:\n\nEach specific color contributes min(l_count[c], r_count[c]) pairs. Then, the remaining left and right can be considered as having ? in both, which can form pairs.\n\nSo, after taking the specific pairs, the remaining left is the total left minus the sum of specific lefts, and similarly for right.\n\nThen, the total possible ? pairs is the minimum of the remaining left ? and right ?.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, after using the specific pairs, the left and right may still have some ? left. These can be paired together regardless of their colors.\n\nSo, perhaps the process is:\n\nCompute the number of specific pairs by summing min(l_c, r_c) for each c.\n\nThen, compute the number of ? pairs as the minimum between the total number of ? in left and ? in right, but also considering that some ? may have been used in the specific pairs.\n\nWait, no. Because the specific pairs may include ? as well. For example, a left ? can pair with a right c, which is a specific pair.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach is:\n\n- For each c in a-z:\n\n   - take t = min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c])\n\n   - add t to specific_pairs\n\n   - subtract t from l_counts[c] and r_counts[c]\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right, the remaining left has sum(l_counts.values()) + left_question, and similarly for right. But wait, after subtracting the specific pairs, the left and right counts for each c would be zero or negative, but perhaps I'm complicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is:\n\n- Count the number of left ? and right ?.\n\n- The maximum possible ? pairs is the minimum of (left ? + right ?).\n\nWait, no. Because each left ? can pair with any right (including non-?), but each right can only pair once.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the specific pairs and ? pairs are not independent. It's possible that a right ? is part of a specific pair, thus reducing the number of available ? rights.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to:\n\n1. For all specific colors, compute the min(l_count[c], r_count[c]), add to the total.\n\n2. Then, for the remaining left and right, consider that any left ? can pair with any right (either ? or specific). But since the specific pairs have already been taken, the remaining right can't be specific anymore except for those that couldn't pair with any left.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the problem as:\n\nTotal pairs = sum over c of min(l[c], r[c]) + max(0, (total_left_q + total_right_q - sum(c)) - something).\n\nNo, that's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is:\n\n- Each left can be matched to a right if either:\n\n   a) Their colors are same and specific.\n\n   b) At least one is a ?.\n\nBut the problem is that when you pair a left ? with a right c, that right c can't be used again.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is equal to the number of specific pairs plus the number of ? pairs possible.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a bipartite graph where edges connect left to right if compatible. We need to find a maximum matching.\n\nBut for n=150k, standard algorithms like Hopcroft-Karp won't work because they are O(E√V), which for 150k nodes would be too slow.\n\nSo, perhaps we need a greedy approach that works.\n\nWait, another idea: for each left, the best right it can pair with is a right that can't pair with any other left. So, perhaps for each left, if it's a specific color, we try to pair it with a right of the same color, and only if none are left, then pair it with a ?.\n\nBut again, this is vague.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the following:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is the sum of:\n\n- For each color c, the minimum of the count in l and r.\n\nPlus, the minimum between the number of left ? and the number of right ? (after subtracting the specific pairs).\n\nWait, no. Because the specific pairs may have used some of the ? in l and r.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me model the problem as:\n\nWe have two sets:\n\nLeft boots: each has a color, which can be a letter or ?.\n\nRight boots: same.\n\nEach pair must consist of a left and right where their colors are compatible.\n\nWe need to select as many pairs as possible, ensuring that each left and each right is used at most once.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to maximize the number of pairs is to:\n\n1. For each color c, match as many l's and r's as possible.\n\n2. Then, for the remaining, match the ?'s on both sides.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nWait, perhaps the steps are:\n\n- Compute the number of specific pairs for each color. For color c, the number is the minimum of l_counts[c] and r_counts[c]. Sum these for all c to get S.\n\n- Now, for the remaining left and right, the number of possible ? pairs is the minimum of the remaining left ? and the remaining right ?.\n\nWait, but the remaining left ? is (original left ?) minus the number of left ? used in specific pairs. Similarly for right.\n\nWait, but in specific pairs, a left ? can pair with a right c (specific) or a right ?.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process is:\n\n1. For each specific color c, match min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c]) pairs. This contributes to the total.\n\n2. Then, for the remaining left and right, the maximum number of pairs is the minimum between the total number of left ? and right ? plus the sum of the remaining specific colors.\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of specific pairs plus the minimum of the remaining left ? and right ?.\n\nBut I'm not confident.\n\nAnother approach: Let me model the problem as follows.\n\nWe have two sets:\n\nLeft: each element has a type (c or ?)\n\nRight: each element has a type (d or ?)\n\nWe can pair L_i with R_j if c_i is d_j or either is ?.\n\nWe need to pair as many as possible, with each L and R used at most once.\n\nThis seems similar to a bipartite graph matching problem, but with n up to 1.5e5, standard approaches are not feasible.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to find for each left, the best possible right, but in a way that maximizes the count.\n\nWait, here's an alternative idea inspired by greedy algorithms:\n\n- For each left, try to match it with a right that is as specific as possible.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps for each color c, we can match as many left c with right c as possible. Then, for the remaining, we can match left ? with any remaining right.\n\nBut even this may not capture all possibilities because sometimes leaving some specific pairs to allow more ? pairs may lead to a higher total.\n\nBut perhaps this is the way to go for a solution that is efficient enough.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. For each color c, compute the number of left c and right c.\n\n   For each c, take t = min(left_c, right_c). Add t to the total.\n\n   Subtract t from left_c and right_c.\n\n2. Now, the remaining left is those that couldn't find a matching in their specific color. These can be either ? or other colors.\n\n3. The remaining right is similar.\n\n4. Now, the remaining left and right can form pairs if either is a ?. Or, if they have the same color but that color's specific pairs have been exhausted.\n\nBut wait, after step 1, for any remaining left of color c, right_c is zero, so any left c can only pair with a right ?.\n\nSimilarly for any right d, if left_d is zero, then the right d can only pair with left ?.\n\nSo, for the remaining, the problem reduces to:\n\nWe have some lefts (some of which are ?) and some rights (some of which are ?), and any left can pair with any right if either is ?.\n\nBut in this case, the maximum number of pairs is the minimum between the total number of remaining lefts and the total number of remaining rights.\n\nWait, no. Because for example, suppose we have 10 left ? and 15 right ?. Then, only 10 pairs can be formed.\n\nBut that's exactly the case.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\nAfter step 1, the maximum number of additional pairs is the minimum of (remaining_left_total, remaining_right_total), where remaining_left_total is the sum of all remaining lefts (including ?) and same for right.\n\nSo, the total pairs would be S (from step 1) plus M, where M is the minimum of (sum_remaining_left, sum_remaining_right).\n\nWait, but what is sum_remaining_left and sum_remaining_right?\n\nsum_remaining_left = total_left - sum(t for each c in specific pairs)\n\nsum_remaining_right = total_right - sum(t for each c in specific pairs)\n\nSo, M = min(sum_remaining_left, sum_remaining_right)\n\nThus, total_pairs = S + M\n\nBut wait, in step 1, for each c, t = min(left_c, right_c). So, after that, for any c, left_c >=0 and right_c >=0.\n\nSo, the remaining lefts are sum_left = sum(left_c for c in all) and same for right.\n\nWait, but after step 1, left_c is the number of lefts of color c that couldn't find a matching.\n\nSimilarly for right_c.\n\nSo, sum_left = sum(left_c for c in all) = n - sum(t for all c).\n\nSame for sum_right.\n\nThus, M = min(sum_left, sum_right)\n\nSo, the total is S + M.\n\nBut wait, that would give the maximum possible pairs.\n\nBut is that always correct?\n\nLet me test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nn=10\n\nl = codeforces\n\nr = dodivthree\n\nWait, but the actual input is probably more complex. Let's see.\n\nWait, looking back, the sample input is:\n\nFirst line is 10.\n\nSecond line is 'codeforces'.\n\nThird line is 'dodivthree'.\n\nWait, but what about the actual specific counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample output shows that the maximum is 5.\n\nBut perhaps the initial approach would compute S as sum of min(l_c, r_c) for each c.\n\nBut perhaps after that, the sum of remaining left and right is 5, so M=5, making total 10.\n\nBut the sample output is 5, but according to this approach, the total would be 10.\n\nHmm, that suggests that my approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, why is that?\n\nBecause perhaps in some cases, the specific pairs are not the maximum possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach of taking all possible specific pairs is not optimal because some specific pairs may block more potential ? pairs.\n\nWait, for example, imagine l has 100 'a's and r has 50 'a's. So, S adds 50. Then, the remaining left 'a's are 50, but the right 'a's are 0.\n\nThese 50 left 'a's can pair with 50 right ?'s, adding 50 to the total, making it 100.\n\nWhich is better than not pairing some specific 'a's to allow more ? pairs.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach is correct.\n\nBut in the sample, perhaps the sum of specific pairs plus M is more than the sample output.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should look at the sample in detail.\n\nWait, sample input has:\n\nn=10\n\nl = codeforces → let's see, the string is 'c o d e f o r c e s'\n\nWait, actually, the exact letters are:\n\nIndices 1-10: 1:c, 2:o, 3:d, 4:e, 5:f, 6:o,7:r,8:c,9:e,10:s.\n\nr is 'dodivthree' → 1:d,2:o,3:d,4:i,5:v,6:t,7:h,8:r,9:e,10:e.\n\nSo, let's count per color:\n\nLeft:\n\nc: positions 1,8 → count 2.\n\no: 2,6 → 2.\n\nd:3 →1.\n\ne:4,9 →2.\n\nf:5 →1.\n\nr:7 →1.\n\ns:10 →1.\n\nOthers: 0.\n\nRight:\n\nd:1,3 →2.\n\no:2 →1.\n\ni:4 →1.\n\nv:5 →1.\n\nt:6 →1.\n\nh:7 →1.\n\nr:8 →1.\n\ne:9,10 →2.\n\nothers: 0.\n\nSo, for each color:\n\nc: left 2, right 0 → t=0.\n\no: left 2, right 1 → t=1.\n\nd: left 1, right 2 → t=1.\n\ne: left 2, right 2 → t=2.\n\nf: left 1, right 0 → t=0.\n\nr: left 1, right 1 → t=1.\n\ns: left 1, right 0 → t=0.\n\nothers: t=0.\n\nSo, S = 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nNow, the remaining left after S:\n\nc: 2-0=2.\n\no:2-1=1.\n\nd:1-1=0.\n\ne:2-2=0.\n\nf:1-0=1.\n\nr:1-1=0.\n\ns:1-0=1.\n\nSum of left remaining: 2+1+0+0+1+0+1 =5.\n\nSimilarly, right remaining:\n\nd:2-2=0.\n\no:1-1=0.\n\ni:1.\n\nv:1.\n\nt:1.\n\nh:1.\n\nr:1-1=0.\n\ne:2-2=0.\n\nSum: 1+1+1+1+1=5.\n\nSo, M = min(5,5)=5.\n\nTotal pairs:5+5=10.\n\nBut sample output says 5. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my approach. So why is that?\n\nAh, because in the sample, the output is 5, but according to this approach, the maximum is 10.\n\nBut that's impossible because the sample output is 5, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, no, the sample output is for a different test case. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at the sample input provided:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nThe following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Colored Boots\n\nThere are n left boots and n right boots. Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings l and r, both of length n. The character l_i stands for the color of the i-th left boot and the character r_i stands for the color of the i-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.\n\nCompute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible. Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\nWait, but the sample outputs show multiple outputs, perhaps for different test cases.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample I was thinking about isn't part of the sample input provided. So, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.\n\nIn the initial approach, after taking all possible specific pairs, the remaining left and right can form M = min(sum_remaining_left, sum_remaining_right) pairs, which are all compatible because they are either ? or their colors are not present in their specific counterparts.\n\nBut perhaps that's not the case. Because for a left of color 'a' and right of color 'b', they cannot pair if neither is a ?. So, after step 1, the remaining left and right may have some colors that are not ? but are not in each other's specific counts.\n\nSo, for example, suppose after step 1, a left has color 'x' and a right has color 'y' which is not 'x'. Both are not '?'. Then, they cannot pair.\n\nThus, the M is not simply the minimum of the sum of remaining left and right, but rather the number of pairs where either left is ?, or right is ?, or left and right are same color (but their specific count was zero).\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach overestimates M.\n\nThus, the problem is more complicated.\n\nAlternative idea: The maximum number of pairs is the sum of:\n\n- For each color c, the minimum of l[c] and r[c].\n\nPlus the number of pairs where one is ? and the other is any color (including ?).\n\nBut how to calculate that.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. Compute S as the sum of min(l[c], r[c]) for each c.\n\n2. Compute the number of left ? and right ?.\n\n   Let Lq = number of left ?.\n\n   Rq = number of right ?.\n\n3. The total possible ? pairs is the minimum of (Lq + Rq) and ... wait, no. Because each ? can pair with any other.\n\nBut, the maximum number of ? pairs is min(Lq, Rq), but wait, no. Because:\n\nSuppose Lq=3, Rq=5. Then, 3 pairs can be formed, using 3 left ? and 3 right ?.\n\nBut if Lq=5, Rq=3: same thing, 3 pairs.\n\nBut if Lq=3 and Rq=3, then 3 pairs.\n\nBut also, any left ? can pair with any right, including non-?. So, for example, if left ? is 3 and right ? is 3, and right non-? is 2, then the 3 left ? can pair with 3 right (2 non-? and 1 ?).\n\nThus, the maximum possible ? pairs is min(Lq, Rq) + min( (sum of non-? left) , (sum of non-? right) )\n\nWait, no. Because after step 1, the non-? left can't pair with any non-? right.\n\nWait, perhaps the ? pairs are all possible left ? paired with any right, and vice versa.\n\nWait, but each left can be paired only once. So, the maximum number of ? pairs is the minimum of the total number of left ? and the total number of right.\n\nWait, no. Because the left ? can pair with any right, including those that are non-?.\n\nBut each right can be used only once.\n\nSo, the maximum number of ? pairs is min( Lq, Rq + sum_nonq_right_available ), but that doesn't make sense.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nAfter step 1, the remaining left and right have:\n\n- left can be of any color, but for specific colors, their right counterparts are exhausted.\n\nSo, any left of color c (not ?) can only pair with right ?.\n\nSimilarly, any right of color d (not ?) can only pair with left ?.\n\nSo, the number of ? pairs is:\n\nmin( Lq + (sum of left non-? that couldn't pair in step 1), Rq + (sum of right non-? that couldn't pair in step 1) )\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is:\n\nAfter step 1:\n\nFor each left of color c (not ?), it can only pair with right ?.\n\nSimilarly, for each right of color d (not ?), it can only pair with left ?.\n\nSo, the number of possible ? pairs is:\n\nnumber of left ? + number of left non-? + number of right ? + number of right non-? ?\n\nNo, that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, the number of ? pairs is the minimum of:\n\n- The number of left ? + the number of right non-? that can't pair with any left.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the problem as:\n\nAfter step 1, the remaining left and right are:\n\nleft_nonq: sum of left counts for c != ?, after step 1.\n\nright_nonq: sum of right counts for c != ?, after step 1.\n\nleft_q: number of left ?.\n\nright_q: number of right ?.\n\nNow, the maximum number of ? pairs is the minimum of:\n\nleft_q + right_nonq and right_q + left_nonq.\n\nWait, no. Because each left q can pair with any right (q or nonq).

For each color c, compute the number of left c and right c. Take the minimum, add to the count. Subtract these from left and right.\n\n2. Now, the remaining left and right can be:\n\n   a) Left ? and any right.\n\n   b) Right ? and any left.\n\n   c) Left non-? and right non-? that couldn't find a specific pair.\n\nSo, after step 1, any left non-? can only pair with right ?.\n\nSimilarly, any right non-? can only pair with left ?.\n\nSo, the number of ? pairs is the sum of:\n\n- The number of left ? + the number of right non-?.\n\nBut each left ? can pair with any right.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of ? pairs is the minimum of:\n\n(left_q + right_nonq) and (right_q + left_nonq).\n\nBut wait, that's not precise.\n\nWait, the maximum number of ? pairs is:\n\nthe minimum between (left_q + right_nonq) and (left_nonq + right_q) ?\n\nNo, that's not correct.\n\nWait, think of it as:\n\nEach left ? can pair with any right (non-? or ?).\n\nEach right ? can pair with any left (non-? or ?).\n\nEach left non-? can pair only with right ?.\n\nEach right non-? can pair only with left ?.\n\nSo, the maximum number of ? pairs is the minimum between:\n\n- The number of left ? plus the number of left non-? (since each can pair with a right ?).\n\n- The number of right ? plus the number of right non-? (since each can pair with a left ?).\n\nWait, no.

(using all 2 left ? and 2 right ?).\n\nThen, the remaining left_nonq (3) can pair with the remaining right ? (1).\n\nAnd the remaining right_nonq (2) can pair with the remaining left ? (0).\n\nSo, total ? pairs: 2 (left ? and right ?) + 1 (left non-? and right ?) =3.\n\nWhich is less than 6.\n\nHmm, so this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nmax_possible_q_pairs = min( (left_q + right_nonq), (right_q + left_nonq) )\n\nBut in the example above, it's 6, but the actual possible is 3.\n\nSo, that's not correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct formula is the minimum of (left_q + right_nonq + right_q) and (left_nonq + left_q + left_nonq).\n\nNo, that's not making sense.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nPerhaps the maximum number of ? pairs is the minimum between:\n\n(left_q + right_nonq) and (right_q + left_nonq).\n\nBut in reality, it's the minimum between (left_q + right_nonq + right_q) and (left_nonq + left_q + right_nonq) ), but that seems unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of ? pairs is the minimum of (left_q + right_nonq + right_q) and (left_nonq + left_q + right_nonq)).\n\nNo, that's not correct.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let me think of the problem as a bipartite graph where edges are allowed between left and right if either is a ?.\n\nWe need to find the maximum matching in this subgraph.\n\nBut for n=150k, this is not feasible with standard algorithms.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem requires a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of ? pairs is the minimum between the total number of left ? and the total number of right ? plus the sum of non-? left and non-? right.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of ? pairs is the minimum of (left_q + right_nonq) and (right_q + left_nonq).\n\nBut earlier example shows that this is not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the problem as:\n\nThe ? pairs can be formed by:\n\n- Left ? paired with any right.\n\n- Right ? paired with any left.\n\nBut each can be used only once.\n\nThus, the maximum number of ? pairs is the minimum between the total number of left ? and the total number of right ? plus the sum of left non-? and right non-?.\n\nNo, that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of ? pairs is the minimum between:\n\n(left_q + right_nonq + right_q) and (left_nonq + left_q + right_nonq).\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nLet me represent the problem as:\n\nAfter step 1, the remaining left and right have:\n\n- Some non-? that couldn't find a specific pair. These can only pair with ?.\n\nSo, the number of non-? left is L_nonq.\n\nThe number of non-? right is R_nonq.\n\nThe number of ? left is L_q.\n\nThe number of ? right is R_q.\n\nThe maximum number of ? pairs is the sum of:\n\n- The number of left ? and right ?.\n\n- Plus the minimum between L_nonq and R_nonq.\n\nBut no, because L_nonq can only pair with R_nonq if they are compatible.\n\nWait, but after step 1, for a left of color c, the right of color c has been exhausted. So, any left c (non-?) can only pair with right ?.\n\nSimilarly for right d (non-?) can only pair with left ?.\n\nThus, the maximum ? pairs is:\n\nmin( (L_q + R_nonq), (R_q + L_nonq) )\n\nBecause:\n\n- Each left ? can pair with any right (so total L_q can pair with R_nonq + R_q).\n\n- Each right ? can pair with any left (so total R_q can pair with L_nonq + L_q).\n\nBut since each left and right can only be used once, the limiting factor is the minimum of:\n\n- The total number of left ? and R_nonq + R_q.\n\n- The total number of right ? and L_nonq + L_q.\n\nWait, no. Because each left ? can be used only once.\n\nSo, the maximum possible ? pairs is the minimum of:\n\n(L_q + R_nonq) and (R_q + L_nonq).\n\nBecause:\n\n- The left ? can pair with R_nonq (each left ? can take one right non-?).\n\n- The left ? can also pair with R_q (but that's limited by R_q).\n\nSimilarly, the right ? can pair with L_nonq and L_q.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of ? pairs is the minimum of (L_q + R_nonq, R_q + L_nonq).\n\nIn the earlier example, L_q=2, R_nonq=4; R_q=3, L_nonq=3.\n\nSo, min(2+4=6, 3+3=6) → 6.\n\nBut in reality, the maximum is 3.\n\nSo, this approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nmax_q_pairs = min(L_q + R_q, L_nonq + R_nonq).\n\nNo, that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the minimum between (L_q + R_nonq) and (R_q + L_nonq).\n\nWait, let's think of another example.\n\nCase 1:\n\nL_q=3, L_nonq=2.\n\nR_q=3, R_nonq=2.\n\nWhat's the maximum ? pairs.\n\nEach left ? can pair with any right.\n\nEach right ? can pair with any left.\n\nEach left non-? can pair with any right ?.\n\nEach right non-? can pair with any left ?.\n\nSo, the maximum possible is 3+2 =5 (all left ?) paired with 3+2=5 right (any).\n\nBut in reality, each can be used once.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum is 5.\n\nBut according to min(3+2=5, 3+2=5), yes.\n\nSo, it's 5.\n\nAnother example:\n\nL_q=2, L_nonq=3.\n\nR_q=3, R_nonq=4.\n\nAs before, the maximum is 3.\n\nBut according to the formula min(2+4=6, 3+3=6), it's 6, which is more than possible.\n\nSo, the formula is incorrect.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe maximum number of ? pairs is the minimum between:\n\n(L_q + R_q + L_nonq + R_nonq) → but that's the total number of ? pairs plus non-? pairs.\n\nNo, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial approach is incorrect and that the maximum number of pairs is not S + M, but S + something else.\n\nThus, perhaps the correct approach is to compute S as the sum of specific pairs, and then the maximum possible ? pairs is the minimum between (L_q + R_nonq) and (R_q + L_nonq).\n\nBut then, in the sample I considered earlier, that would give 6, but the actual maximum is 3.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is not to take the sum of specific pairs and then the ? pairs, but instead to find a way to maximize the sum of specific pairs and ? pairs, but without overlapping.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nAn alternative approach is needed.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is the sum of specific pairs plus the minimum of (L_q, R_q) plus the minimum of (L_nonq, R_nonq).\n\nWait, that's possibly wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached as a bipartite graph where each edge represents compatibility, and the maximum matching is the required answer. But with n up to 150,000, this is impractical.\n\nThus, perhaps the solution is to model it as:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is the sum of the specific pairs plus the number of ? pairs, which",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots.
