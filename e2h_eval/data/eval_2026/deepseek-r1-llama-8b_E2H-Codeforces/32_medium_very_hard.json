    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. The first thing that comes to mind is that for each possible element to remove, I need to compute the instability of the resulting array and then find the minimum among all those possibilities. But wait, the problem constraints say n can be up to 1e5, which is 100,000. If I try to do this naively, like checking each element by creating a new array each time, that's going to be O(n^2) time, which won't work because 1e10 operations are way too slow.\n\nSo I need a smarter way. Let me see. The key here is to find for each element, what happens when I remove it. What affects the max and min? Well, if the element I'm removing is either the current max or the current min, then removing it might change the overall max or min of the array.\n\nWait, but in other cases, like when the array has multiple instances of the max or min, removing one of them might not affect the max or min at all. So I need to find, for each possible element to remove, what the new max and min would be, then calculate their difference.\n\nBut computing the new max and min each time for each removed element is expensive. How can I do this efficiently?\n\nHmm. Maybe I can precompute some structures. Like, for each position, find the next max and next min when that element is removed. Or maybe precompute the global max and min, but that's only part of the story.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal way is to consider that the new array's max and min could come from different parts of the original array. For example, if the element being removed is the current max, but there are other elements equal to it, then the max doesn't change. Similarly for the min.\n\nSo, let me think: the initial step is to find the current max and min of the entire array. Then, for each element a[i], if a[i] is the max, we need to check if there are other elements equal to it. If yes, then the new max is still the same. Otherwise, the new max would be the second max. Similarly for the min.\n\nBut how to compute the second max and second min efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the minimal instability after removing an element is max(remaining elements) - min(remaining elements). To minimize this, we can aim to have both the max and min as close as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal instability will be achieved when the remaining array has either the same max and min as before (if the element removed wasn't contributing to either), or when we remove an element that was the current max or min and then the next ones adjust accordingly.\n\nSo, maybe the steps are:\n\n1. Find the global max and min of the array.\n\n2. For each element a[i], determine whether removing it would cause the max to decrease or the min to increase, or neither.\n\n3. Compute the new max and min for the array without a[i], then calculate the difference.\n\n4. Find the minimum such difference across all possible i.\n\nBut again, doing this for each i directly is O(n), which is manageable, but the challenge is computing the new max and min quickly.\n\nHmm, but how do I compute the new max and min when I remove a[i]? One approach is to precompute the second max and second min, but that's only sufficient if the element being removed is the sole max or min.\n\nWait, for example, if the array has multiple max elements, then removing one won't change the max. Similarly for min.\n\nSo, perhaps I can precompute:\n\n- The count of max elements.\n\n- The count of min elements.\n\nThen, for each a[i], if a[i] is the max:\n\n- if count_max > 1: the new max remains the same.\n\n- else: the new max is the second max.\n\nSimilarly for min.\n\nBut how do I find the second max and second min?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can precompute the prefix and suffix maxima and minima for each position.\n\nWait, that's an interesting idea. Let me explain.\n\nFor each position i, I can compute the maximum from the left side (elements before i) and the maximum from the right side (elements after i). Then, the maximum of these two would be the maximum of the array excluding a[i]. Similarly for the minimum.\n\nYes! That makes sense. Because when you remove a[i], the new max is the maximum of the elements to the left of i and the elements to the right of i.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute for each index i, the maximum and minimum of the array excluding a[i].\n\n- Then, for each i, compute the difference between this new max and new min.\n\n- The minimal such difference across all i is the answer.\n\nSo, the question is: how to compute, for each i, the maximum of the array without a[i], and similarly for the minimum.\n\nComputing prefix and suffix maxima and minima can help here.\n\nLet's see. For the maximum:\n\nWe can create two arrays, left_max and right_max.\n\nleft_max[i] represents the maximum from the array[0..i-1].\n\nright_max[i] represents the maximum from the array[i+1..n-1].\n\nThen, for each i, the maximum without a[i] is max(left_max[i], right_max[i]).\n\nSimilarly for the minimum.\n\nSo, how to compute left_max and right_max.\n\nFor left_max:\n\nInitialize left_max[0] = -infinity.\n\nFor i from 1 to n-1:\n\nleft_max[i] = max(left_max[i-1], a[i-1])\n\nWait, no. Because for left_max[i], we want the maximum from a[0] to a[i-1]. So, for i=0, left_max is nothing, so it's -infinity. For i=1, it's a[0]. For i=2, it's max(a[0], a[1]), etc.\n\nSimilarly, for right_max, we can compute from the end.\n\nOnce we have left_max and right_max, for each i, the maximum without a[i] is the max of left_max[i] and right_max[i].\n\nSame logic applies for the minima, using left_min and right_min arrays.\n\nOnce we have these four arrays, for each i, we can compute the new_max and new_min.\n\nWait, but what about the min? We need the min of the array after removing a[i], which is the min of the left and right parts.\n\nSo, for each i, new_max = max(left_max[i], right_max[i])\n\nnew_min = min(left_min[i], right_min[i])\n\nThen, the instability for removing a[i] is new_max - new_min.\n\nWe compute this for all i, and find the minimal value.\n\nThat sounds manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nFirst, read n and the array a.\n\nCompute left_max and right_max:\n\nInitialize left_max as an array of size n.\n\nleft_max[0] = -infinity.\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    left_max[i] = max(left_max[i-1], a[i-1])\n\nSimilarly, right_max[n-1] = -infinity.\n\nfor i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n\n    right_max[i] = max(right_max[i+1], a[i+1])\n\nWait, no. Wait, right_max[i] should be the maximum of the elements after i. So, for i = n-2, right_max[i] is a[n-1].\n\nFor i = n-3, right_max[i] is max(a[i+1], right_max[i+1]).\n\nSo, the code for right_max would be:\n\nright_max = [0]*n\n\nright_max[-1] = -infinity\n\nfor i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n\n    right_max[i] = max(a[i+1], right_max[i+1])\n\nWait, no. Because when i is n-2, the elements after i are just a[n-1]. So right_max[i] should be a[n-1]. For i = n-3, it's max(a[n-2], a[n-1])? No, wait, no. Because the elements after i are a[i+1], a[i+2], ..., a[n-1]. So right_max[i] is the maximum of all elements from a[i+1] onward.\n\nSo, for i, right_max[i] = max(a[i+1], right_max[i+1]).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly for left_max: left_max[i] is the maximum of a[0..i-1], which can be computed as the max between a[i-1] and left_max[i-1].\n\nWait, but for i=0, left_max is undefined. So, we can initialize left_max[0] as -infinity.\n\nSo, for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\nleft_max[i] = max(left_max[i-1], a[i-1])\n\nOnce left_max and right_max are computed, for each i, the maximum without a[i] is max(left_max[i], right_max[i]).\n\nSimilarly for minima.\n\nCompute left_min and right_min:\n\nleft_min[0] = +infinity.\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    left_min[i] = min(left_min[i-1], a[i-1])\n\nright_min[n-1] = +infinity.\n\nfor i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n\n    right_min[i] = min(right_min[i+1], a[i+1])\n\nThen, for each i, the new_min is min(left_min[i], right_min[i]).\n\nOnce we have new_max and new_min for each i, the instability is new_max - new_min.\n\nWe compute this for all i, and find the minimal value.\n\nYes, that seems solid.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7\n\nSample Output: 2.\n\nSo, the array is [1,3,3,7].\n\nCompute left_max:\n\nleft_max[0] = -infinite.\n\nleft_max[1] = max(-infinite, 1) = 1.\n\nleft_max[2] = max(1,3)=3.\n\nleft_max[3] = max(3,3)=3.\n\nleft_max[4] = max(3,7)=7? Wait, no, wait. Wait, n is 4, indices 0-3.\n\nWait, for i in 1 to 3:\n\ni=1: left_max[1] = max(left_max[0], a[0}) → max(-inf, 1) =1.\n\ni=2: left_max[2] = max(left_max[1]=1, a[1}=3) →3.\n\ni=3: left_max[3] = max(3, a[2}=3) →3.\n\nright_max:\n\nright_max[3] = -inf.\n\ni=2: right_max[2] = max(a[3}, right_max[3}) →7.\n\ni=1: right_max[1] = max(a[2}=3, right_max[2}=7) →7.\n\ni=0: right_max[0] = max(a[1}=3, right_max[1}=7) →7.\n\nSo, for each i, the new_max is:\n\ni=0: max(left_max[0}=-infty, right_max[0}=7) →7.\n\ni=1: max(left_max[1}=1, right_max[1}=7) →7.\n\ni=2: max(left_max[2}=3, right_max[2}=7) →7.\n\ni=3: max(left_max[3}=3, right_max[3}=-infty) →3.\n\nWait, wait, no. For i=3, right_max[3] is -infty because there are no elements after i=3. So the new_max is left_max[3}=3.\n\nSimilarly, for the minima:\n\nCompute left_min:\n\nleft_min[0] = inf.\n\ni=1: min(inf, 1) →1.\n\ni=2: min(1,3) →1.\n\ni=3: min(1,3) →1.\n\ni=4: wait, n=4, indices 0-3. So for i=3, left_min[3} is min(left_min[2}=1, a[2}=3) →1.\n\nright_min:\n\nright_min[3] = inf.\n\ni=2: right_min[2} = min(a[3}=7, inf) →7.\n\ni=1: right_min[1} = min(a[2}=3, right_min[2}=7) →3.\n\ni=0: right_min[0} = min(a[1}=3, right_min[1}=3) →3.\n\nSo for each i:\n\ni=0: new_min = min(left_min[0}=inf, right_min[0}=3) →3.\n\ni=1: new_min = min(left_min[1}=1, right_min[1}=3) →1.\n\ni=2: new_min = min(left_min[2}=1, right_min[2}=7) →1.\n\ni=3: new_min = min(left_min[3}=1, right_min[3}=inf) →1.\n\nSo the instabilities are:\n\ni=0: 7 -3 =4.\n\ni=1:7-1=6.\n\ni=2:7-1=6.\n\ni=3:3-1=2.\n\nSo the minimal is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nInput:\n\n2\n\n1 100000\n\nAfter removing 1, the array is [1e5], so instability is 0.\n\nAfter removing 1e5, the array is [1], also 0.\n\nSo the minimal is 0.\n\nLet me compute via the method.\n\nleft_max[0] = -inf.\n\nleft_max[1] = max(-inf, 1) →1.\n\nright_max[0] = max(1e5, right_max[1}=-inf) →1e5.\n\nright_max[1} = -inf.\n\nFor i=0: new_max is max(-inf, right_max[0}=1e5) →1e5.\n\nnew_min is min(left_min[0}=inf, right_min[0}=1e5) →1e5.\n\ninstability is 0.\n\nFor i=1: new_max is max(left_max[1}=1, right_max[1}=-inf) →1.\n\nnew_min is min(left_min[1}=1, right_min[1}=inf) →1.\n\nSo instability is 0.\n\nThus, the minimal is 0.\n\nSo the approach works for samples.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where all elements are the same.\n\nE.g., n=3, a=[5,5,5]\n\nRemoving any element, the array remains with two 5's, so max=5, min=5, instability is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=5, a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Removing 3.\n\nThe new array is [1,2,4,5]. Max is 5, min is 1. Instability is 4.\n\nBut if I remove 5, the new array is [1,2,3,4], instability 3.\n\nIf I remove 1, the new array is [2,3,4,5], instability 3.\n\nWait, but according to our approach:\n\nCompute left_max and right_max for each i.\n\nFor i=2 (a[i]=3), left_max is max(1,2) =2; right_max is max(4,5) =5. So new_max is 5.\n\nLeft_min is min(1,2) =1; right_min is min(4,5)=4. So new_min is 1.\n\nSo instability is 5-1=4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, a = [1, 100, 50].\n\nWhat's the minimal instability?\n\nIf I remove 1, the array is [100,50]. Max is 100, min is 50 → diff 50.\n\nIf I remove 100, the array is [1,50]. Diff 49.\n\nIf I remove 50, the array is [1,100]. Diff 99.\n\nSo the minimal is 49.\n\nAccording to our method:\n\nCompute left_max and right_max.\n\nleft_max:\n\nleft_max[0] = -inf.\n\nleft_max[1] = max(-inf, 1) =1.\n\nleft_max[2] = max(1,100) =100.\n\nleft_max[3] = ... no, n=3, indices 0-2.\n\nWait, for i=0: left_max[0} is -inf.\n\ni=1: left_max[1} is a[0}=1.\n\ni=2: left_max[2} is max(left_max[1}=1, a[1}=100) →100.\n\nright_max:\n\ni=0: right_max[0} is max(a[1}=100, a[2}=50, right_max[1}=max(a[2}=50, right_max[2}=-inf)) →100.\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute:\n\nright_max is computed from the end.\n\nright_max[2} = -inf.\n\nright_max[1} = max(a[2}=50, right_max[2}=-inf) →50.\n\nright_max[0} = max(a[1}=100, right_max[1}=50) →100.\n\nSo for each i:\n\ni=0: new_max is max(left_max[0}=-inf, right_max[0}=100) →100.\n\ni=1: max(left_max[1}=1, right_max[1}=50) →50.\n\ni=2: max(left_max[2}=100, right_max[2}=-inf) →100.\n\nSimilarly for min.\n\nleft_min:\n\nleft_min[0} = inf.\n\nleft_min[1} = min(inf, 1) →1.\n\nleft_min[2} = min(1, 100) →1.\n\nleft_min[3} is beyond the array.\n\nright_min:\n\nright_min[2} = inf.\n\nright_min[1} = min(a[2}=50, right_min[2}=inf) →50.\n\nright_min[0} = min(a[1}=100, right_min[1}=50) →50.\n\nSo for each i:\n\ni=0: new_min is min(left_min[0}=inf, right_min[0}=50) →50.\n\ni=1: new_min is min(left_min[1}=1, right_min[1}=50) →1.\n\ni=2: new_min is min(left_min[2}=1, right_min[2}=inf) →1.\n\nSo the instabilities:\n\ni=0: 100-50=50.\n\ni=1:50-1=49.\n\ni=2:100-1=99.\n\nThus, the minimal is 49.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the approach works.\n\nNow, the plan is to implement this.\n\nIn Python, for n up to 1e5, this is feasible.\n\nImplementing the steps:\n\nRead n and a.\n\nCompute left_max and right_max.\n\nCompute left_min and right_min.\n\nFor each i, compute new_max and new_min, then the instability.\n\nFind the minimum of these instabilities.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the array a as a list of integers.\n\nCompute left_max:\n\nleft_max = [0] * n\n\nleft_max[0] = -infinity.\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    left_max[i] = max(left_max[i-1], a[i-1])\n\nCompute right_max:\n\nright_max = [0] * n\n\nright_max[-1] = -infinity.\n\nfor i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n\n    right_max[i] = max(a[i+1], right_max[i+1])\n\nCompute left_min:\n\nleft_min = [0] * n\n\nleft_min[0] = infinity.\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    left_min[i] = min(left_min[i-1], a[i-1])\n\nCompute right_min:\n\nright_min = [0] * n\n\nright_min[-1] = infinity.\n\nfor i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n\n    right_min[i] = min(a[i+1], right_min[i+1])\n\nThen, for each i in 0...n-1:\n\ncurrent_max = max(left_max[i], right_max[i])\n\ncurrent_min = min(left_min[i], right_min[i])\n\ninstability = current_max - current_min\n\nkeep track of the minimal instability.\n\nFinally, print the minimal instability.\n\nBut in Python, for large n, initializing arrays of size 1e5 is manageable.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling the initial values correctly.\n\n- Using float('inf') and float('-inf').\n\nAnother point: since a[i] can be up to 1e5, but in Python, handling large numbers is fine.\n\nTesting the code:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=4, a=[1,3,3,7]\n\nleft_max:\n\n[ -inf, 1, 3, 3 ]\n\nright_max:\n\n[7,7,7, -inf]\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, let's re-calculate.\n\nWait, for i from 0 to 3.\n\ni=0: right_max[0} = max(a[1}=3, a[2}=3, a[3}=7) →7.\n\ni=1: right_max[1} = max(a[2}=3, a[3}=7) →7.\n\ni=2: right_max[2} = a[3}=7.\n\ni=3: right_max[3}=-inf.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, in code:\n\nright_max is initialized as [0]*n.\n\nright_max[-1] = -inf.\n\nThen, for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n\nSo for n=4, i goes from 2, 1, 0.\n\nFor i=2:\n\nright_max[2} = max(a[3}, right_max[3}=-inf) →7.\n\ni=1:\n\nright_max[1} = max(a[2}=3, right_max[2}=7) →7.\n\ni=0:\n\nright_max[0} = max(a[1}=3, right_max[1}=7) →7.\n\nSo right_max is [7,7,7,-inf].\n\nWait, but for i=3, right_max is -inf.\n\nSo when i=3, left_max[3} is 3.\n\nright_max[3} is -inf.\n\nso new_max is 3.\n\nSo for i=3, new_max is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: when all elements are same.\n\nn=3, a=[5,5,5].\n\nleft_max:\n\ni=0: -inf.\n\ni=1: max(-inf,5) →5.\n\ni=2: max(5,5) →5.\n\nleft_max: [-inf,5,5]\n\nright_max:\n\ni=2: -inf.\n\ni=1: max(5, right_max[2}=-inf) →5.\n\ni=0: max(5, right_max[1}=5) →5.\n\nright_max: [5,5,-inf]\n\nSo for each i:\n\ni=0: new_max = max(left_max[0}=-inf, right_max[0}=5) →5.\n\ni=1: max(5,5) →5.\n\ni=2: max(5, -inf) →5.\n\nSimilarly for min.\n\nThus, all instabilities are 0.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nAlso, considering that in Python, the initial value for left_max and right_max is important.\n\nSo in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nleft_max = [ -float('inf') ] * n\n\nleft_min = [ float('inf') ] * n\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    left_max[i] = max(left_max[i-1], a[i-1])\n\n    left_min[i] = min(left_min[i-1], a[i-1])\n\nright_max = [ -float('inf') ] * n\n\nright_min = [ float('inf') ] * n\n\nfor i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n\n    right_max[i] = max(a[i+1], right_max[i+1])\n\n    right_min[i] = min(a[i+1], right_min[i+1])\n\nmin_instability = float('inf')\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    current_max = max(left_max[i], right_max[i])\n\n    current_min = min(left_min[i], right_min[i])\n\n    instability = current_max - current_min\n\n    if instability < min_instability:\n\n        min_instability = instability\n\nprint(min_instability)\n\nWait, but in the sample input 2, when n=2, the code gives 0.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for i=0:\n\nleft_max[0} is -inf.\n\nright_max[0} is a[1}.\n\nso current_max is max(-inf, a[1}) →a[1}.\n\nleft_min[0} is inf.\n\nright_min[0} is a[1}.\n\nso current_min is a[1}.\n\nThus, instability is 0.\n\nSame for i=1: current_max is a[0}, current_min is a[0}.\n\nThus, correct.\n\nAnother test case.\n\nTest case: n=3, a = [1, 100, 50].\n\nAs before, the code should compute the minimal instability as 49.\n\nI think the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the efficiency.\n\nEach loop is O(n), and all steps are O(n). So for 1e5, it's manageable.\n\nSpace-wise, for 1e5, four arrays of 1e5 integers: about 4*1e5 *4 bytes ≈ 400KB, which is acceptable.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\n- All elements same.\n\n- n=2.\n\n- n=1: but according to the problem statement, n>=2.\n\nWait, problem says 2 <=n <=1e5.\n\nThus, no need to handle n=1.\n\nAnother case: n=5, a = [1,2,5,5,10].\n\nIf I remove 10, the new max is 5.\n\nIf I remove 5, but there are others, then max remains 10.\n\nWait, no. If I remove one of the 5's, the max is still 10.\n\nThus, the code needs to handle cases where multiple elements are the same.\n\nIn code, the left_max and right_max take care of that.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The instability of an array is maximized by the range between its maximum and minimum values. Removing an element can potentially reduce this range. We need to find the element whose removal results in the smallest possible range.\n2. **Intuition**: For each element, removing it can affect the maximum or minimum value of the array if that element was the sole maximum or minimum. If there are multiple instances of the maximum or minimum, removing one won't change the range.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of recalculating the maximum and minimum for each possible removal, we precompute prefix and suffix arrays for both maxima and minima. These arrays help us quickly determine the new maxima and minima when any element is removed.\n4. **Algorithm**:\n   - Compute `left_max` and `right_max` arrays to store the maximum values from the left and right of each index.\n   - Compute `left_min` and `right_min` arrays to store the minimum values from the left and right of each index.\n   - For each element, determine the new maxima and minima using the precomputed arrays and calculate the instability.\n   - Track the minimum instability across all possible removals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    # Precompute left_max and left_min\n    left_max = [-float('inf')] * n\n    left_min = [float('inf')] * n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        left_max[i] = max(left_max[i-1], a[i-1])\n        left_min[i] = min(left_min[i-1], a[i-1])\n    \n    # Precompute right_max and right_min\n    right_max = [-float('inf')] * n\n    right_min = [float('inf')] * n\n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        right_max[i] = max(a[i+1], right_max[i+1])\n        right_min[i] = min(a[i+1], right_min[i+1])\n    \n    min_instability = float('inf')\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_max = max(left_max[i], right_max[i])\n        current_min = min(left_min[i], right_min[i])\n        instability = current_max - current_min\n        if instability < min_instability:\n            min_instability = instability\n    print(min_instability)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.\n2. **Prefix Arrays**: `left_max` and `left_min` arrays are built to store the maximum and minimum values from the start up to each index.\n3. **Suffix Arrays**: `right_max` and `right_min` arrays are built to store the maximum and minimum values from each index to the end.\n4. **Instability Calculation**: For each element, compute the potential new maxima and minima using the precomputed arrays, then calculate the instability and track the minimum value.\n5. **Output**: The minimum instability found is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required values in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 100,000 elements.",
