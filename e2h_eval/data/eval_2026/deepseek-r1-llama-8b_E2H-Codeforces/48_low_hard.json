            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to convert a number from base a to base b, but with a twist. The third part of each door's lock has a number c in base a, and depending on whether the second part is R (meaning it's using the Roman numeral system) or another number, I have to write c in base b, either as a Roman numeral or as a regular integer.\n\nHmm, let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the input gives two integers a and b on the first line. Then, the next line is a string representing c in base a. But wait, the second part could be R, which means that for that case, the conversion is to Roman numerals in base b. Otherwise, it's a normal base conversion.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Read the input correctly. The first line is a and b, but b can be 'R'. If b is 'R', then when converting, we have to represent the number in Roman numerals instead of a standard base.\n\n2. Read the number c, which is given in base a. So, I'll need to parse this string into its integer value.\n\n3. Convert this integer into base b. But if b is 'R', then instead of writing the number in base 10 as digits, I need to represent it as a Roman numeral according to the rules provided.\n\nWait, but how do I know whether the second part is R or not? Looking back at the problem statement: the second part is either an integer b or R. So, the input line for the number is like \"c_in_base_a\" followed by 'R' or some other number.\n\nWait, no. The input line is a single string where the first part is the c number in base a, and the second part is either b or R. For example, the sample input shows lines like '16 R\\n5', which probably means that the c number is '16' in base a (which is 10), and the second part is R, indicating that the output should be a Roman numeral.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first line after the initial a and b is the c number in base a. The second part is either R or another number. Oh, no, maybe I misread. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait, the second line is a single non-negative integer c in base a. It says that the second part may contain R, but I think that the entire line is a string where the first part is the number in base a, and the second part is either R or some other number which is the base b. Or wait, perhaps the second part is the base, which could be R, meaning that the output should be in Roman numerals.\n\nWait, the first line is two integers a and b, but the second integer could be R. So for example, if the second line is '5 R', then the number c is '5' in base a, and the base for output is R (i.e., Roman numerals). So the output should be 5 written in Roman numerals as 'V'.\n\nBut wait, the sample input shows:\n\nFor example, the first input is ['10 2\\n1', ...], which implies that a is 10, b is 2, and the c number is '1' in base 10. So the output is '1' in base 2, which is '1'.\n\nAnother sample is '5 R\\n4', which I think means that c is '5' in base a (but what is a here?) Wait, no, the first line is a and b. So, for example, if the input is '5 R', then a is 10, and b is R, so the output is 'IV' because 4 in base 10 is IV in Roman numerals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b. Only b may be replaced by an R. So, the second part of the first line is b, which could be R. So, for example, the first line could be '10 R\\n...'. Then, when converting, the output should be in Roman numerals.\n\nThe next line is a single non-negative integer c in base a. So, c is a string that represents a number in base a.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- Parse a and b. If b is 'R', then the output is a Roman numeral representation of c converted to base 10. Otherwise, it's the decimal equivalent of c in base a, converted to base b as a string, without leading zeros.\n\nWait, but the second part of the first line is b. So, in the first line, the two parts are a and b, but b can be 'R'. So, for example, the first line could be",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from base `a` to either base `b` or Roman numerals, depending on the input. The solution involves parsing the input, converting the number, and then formatting the output appropriately.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Parse Input**: Read the integers `a` and `b`, where `b` can be 'R' indicating Roman numerals.\n2. **Convert Number**: Convert the given number from base `a` to an integer.\n3. **Determine Output Format**: If `b` is 'R', convert the integer to a Roman numeral. Otherwise, convert the integer to base `b`.\n4. **Format Output**: Ensure the output does not have leading zeros and is in the correct format (either Roman numeral or base `b` string).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef int_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            num -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if len(input) < 2:\n        print('')\n        return\n    parts = input[0].split()\n    a = int(parts[0])\n    b = parts[1]\n    c_str = input[1].strip()\n    \n    # Convert c_str from base a to integer\n    c = 0\n    for ch in c_str:\n        c = c * a + int(ch)\n    \n    if b == 'R':\n        print(int_to_roman(c))\n    else:\n        # Convert c to base b as a string\n        if c == 0:\n            print('0')\n            return\n        res = []\n        while c > 0:\n            remainder = c % b\n            res.append(str(remainder))\n            c = c // b\n        # Reverse to get the correct order\n        res = ''.join(reversed(res))\n        print(res.lstrip('0') or '0')\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line. The first line contains `a` and `b`, and the second line contains the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion to Integer**: The number `c` is converted from base `a` to a decimal integer.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If `b` is 'R', the integer is converted to a Roman numeral using a helper function that maps values to their Roman equivalents.\n4. **Base Conversion**: For other values of `b`, the integer is converted to the specified base and formatted as a string without leading zeros.\n\nThis approach ensures that the conversion is efficient and handles all edge cases, including leading zeros and the special case of Roman numerals.",
