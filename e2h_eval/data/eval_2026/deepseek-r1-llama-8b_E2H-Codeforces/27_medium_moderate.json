On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a sequence of numbers representing performers holding rods high or low. Tommy wants to choose an interval [l, r] and reverse the subarray from l to r. Then, he wants to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after this reversal.\n\nHmm, the input is a sequence where each element is either 1 or 2. The output is the maximum LNDS possible after reversing any possible subarray.\n\nWait, but what's the goal here? We need to consider all possible intervals [l, r], reverse them, compute the LNDS for each case, and find the maximum among all possibilities.\n\nBut n can be up to 2000, which is manageable but not trivial. Reversing every possible subarray would be O(n^2) operations. For each reversed subarray, computing the LNDS could take O(n^2) time if done naively, which would make the total complexity O(n^4), which is way too big for n=2000.\n\nSo, I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the sequence. Since the elements are only 1s and 2s, maybe there's a pattern or a way to model the problem that avoids checking every possible subarray.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal reversal will create a longer run of 1s followed by 2s. Because 1s can't be part of a non-decreasing subsequence beyond their count if they are consecutive. So, the maximum possible LNDS is either the original sequence's LNDS or something achieved by making as many 1s as possible come before 2s.\n\nSo, maybe the optimal interval to reverse is the one that brings the maximum number of 1s to the left and 2s to the right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal LNDS can be found by considering all possible split points between 1s and 2s and see how reversing certain intervals can affect these splits.\n\nAnother thought: since we can reverse any interval, the effect is that within that interval, the order of 1s and 2s is flipped. So, in the reversed subarray, all the 1s will come before 2s in that interval. But outside the interval, the order remains as is.\n\nWait, that's not quite accurate. Reversing a subarray changes the positions of the elements in that subarray. So, the order of 1s and 2s inside the reversed subarray is inverted. So, for example, if the original subarray has some 1s followed by 2s, reversing it would result in 2s followed by 1s. Which might not be good for a non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the subarray is reversed. So the elements in the subarray are in reverse order. So if the subarray was [1,2,1,2], reversing it becomes [2,1,2,1]. So the 1s and 2s are now in a different order within the subarray.\n\nThis complicates things because the reversed subarray may have a mix of 1s and 2s, but in the opposite order.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that the reversed subarray can allow for more 1s to appear before 2s, thus increasing the length of the non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nWait, but the LNDS counts the longest non-decreasing sequence. So, if we can arrange as many 1s as possible before 2s, the LNDS would be the count of 1s plus the count of 2s, but that's only possible if all 1s come before 2s.\n\nBut in reality, the original sequence may already have that arrangement, or it may not. Our task is to find whether reversing a certain subarray can lead to a better arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal LNDS can be found by considering for each possible position i, the maximum number of 1s up to i and the maximum number of 2s from i onwards, and then adding them. The maximum over all i would be a candidate for the answer. But this doesn't account for the possibility of reversing a subarray to merge the 1s and 2s.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nOriginal sequence is 1,2,1,2. The current LNDS is 3 (like 1,2,2). After reversing positions 2-3 (so the subarray [2,1] becomes [1,2]), the array becomes 1,1,2,2, which allows a LNDS of 4.\n\nSo, by reversing, we can get all 1s before 2s, giving a longer LNDS.\n\nThus, the optimal solution might involve finding a point where the number of 1s before and 2s after can be maximized by reversing a subarray that covers some elements in between.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to precompute for each possible split point i (between 0 and n), the maximum number of 1s in the prefix up to i, the maximum number of 2s in the suffix starting at i+1, and then see if by reversing a subarray that starts before i and ends after i, we can connect these two parts optimally.\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose that for each possible interval [l, r], when we reverse it, the subarray will have its own 1s and 2s in reverse order. So, for the entire array after reversal, the LNDS can be calculated as the sum of the maximum number of 1s in the prefix, plus the maximum number of 2s in the suffix, but also considering how the reversed subarray contributes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible interval [l, r], the maximum possible LNDS is equal to the maximum between the original LNDS and (the number of 1s in [l, r] + the number of 2s in [l, r]) + the number of 1s before l and 2s after r.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because, when you reverse [l, r], all the 1s in [l, r] come before the 2s in [l, r]. So, if we can arrange the reversed subarray such that all 1s are on the left and 2s on the right, then the total LNDS is the sum of the 1s in [l, r], plus the 2s in [l, r], plus the 1s before l and 2s after r.\n\nWait, no. Because the 1s before l and the 2s after r are fixed. But the 1s and 2s in the reversed subarray can potentially form a non-decreasing sequence with those 1s and 2s.\n\nSo, the maximum LNDS after reversing [l, r] could be:\n\nmax_ones_before_l = number of 1s in [1..l-1]\nmax_twos_after_r = number of 2s in [r+1..n]\nmax_ones_in_subarray = number of 1s in [l..r]\nmax_twos_in_subarray = number of 2s in [l..r]\n\nThen, the total would be max_ones_before_l + (max_ones_in_subarray + max_twos_in_subarray) + max_twos_after_r.\n\nWait, no. Because when you reverse [l, r], the 1s and 2s in the subarray are in reverse order. So, the 1s in the subarray that were originally after the 2s are now before the 2s. So, in the reversed subarray, all the 1s in [l..r] come before the 2s in [l..r].\n\nSo, in the entire array after reversal, the 1s in [l..r] are before the 2s in [l..r], and the 1s before l and the 2s after r are also in their places.\n\nSo, the LNDS can include all the 1s before l, then all the 1s in [l..r], followed by all the 2s in [l..r], and then all the 2s after r.\n\nSo, the maximum possible LNDS after reversing [l, r] is:\n\nnumber_of_1s_before_l + number_of_1s_in_subarray + number_of_2s_in_subarray + number_of_2s_after_r.\n\nWait, but that seems like it's assuming that the 1s in the subarray and the 2s in the subarray can be connected in a non-decreasing way. But if the subarray has both 1s and 2s, then after reversal, the 1s in the subarray will be followed by 2s. So, the 1s in the subarray can be added to the 1s before l, and the 2s in the subarray can be added to the 2s after r.\n\nWait, no. Because the 1s in the subarray are now before the 2s in the subarray. So, the 1s in the subarray can be added to the 1s before l, and the 2s in the subarray can be added to the 2s after r.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the array is [1,2,1,2]. If we reverse positions 2 and 3, the subarray [2,1] becomes [1,2]. Now the array is [1,1,2,2]. The LNDS is 4, which is 1+1+2+2, but that's not the case. Wait, no. The LNDS is the longest non-decreasing sequence. Here, the entire array is non-decreasing, so the LNDS is 4.\n\nIn this case, the 1s before l (which is 1) is 1. The 1s in the subarray (positions 2-3) were 1 (position 3) and 2 (position 2) before reversal. After reversal, in the subarray, the 1 comes first, then the 2. So, in the subarray, the 1 is added to the 1s before, and the 2 is added to the 2s after.\n\nWait, but the 2s after r (position 4) are 2. So, the calculation would be:\n\nbefore l: 1 (element 1)\nsubarray 1s: 1 (from position 3)\nsubarray 2s: 1 (from position 2)\nafter r: 1 (element 4)\n\nSo, 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4, which matches.\n\nYes, so the formula is:\n\nmax_possible = (number of 1s before l) + (number of 1s in [l..r]) + (number of 2s in [l..r]) + (number of 2s after r).\n\nBut wait, isn't the number of 2s in [l..r] added to the 1s in the subarray? Or should it be the other way around?\n\nNo, because after reversing, the 1s in the subarray come before the 2s in the subarray. So, the 1s in the subarray can be added to the 1s before, and the 2s in the subarray can be added to the 2s after.\n\nBut why? Because the 1s before l are in their order, the subarray's 1s are now in a block, and the 2s after r are in their order. So, the LNDS can be formed by taking all 1s before l, then all 1s in the subarray, then all 2s in the subarray, then all 2s after r.\n\nThus, the total is indeed the sum of those four parts.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute for each position l, the number of 1s before l.\n\n2. Precompute for each position r, the number of 2s after r.\n\n3. For each possible interval [l, r], compute the number of 1s in [l..r], and the number of 2s in [l..r].\n\n4. For each [l, r], calculate the value as (pre_ones[l] + ones_in_subarray + twos_in_subarray + post_twos[r]).\n\n5. Find the maximum such value across all [l, r].\n\n6. Compare this maximum with the original LNDS (without any reversal). The overall answer is the maximum between the two.\n\nWait, but why do we need to compare with the original? Because perhaps the best option is not to reverse any subarray, just take the original sequence's LNDS.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Compute the original LNDS length.\n\n- For all possible [l, r], compute the potential LNDS after reversal as per the formula above.\n\n- Take the maximum between the original and all computed potentials.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to efficiently calculating, for all [l, r], the sum (pre_ones[l] + ones_in_subarray + twos_in_subarray + post_twos[r]).\n\nNow, how to compute this efficiently.\n\nFirst, let's precompute:\n\n- pre_ones[i]: the number of 1s in a[1..i-1]. So, for l, pre_ones[l] is the number of 1s before position l.\n\nSimilarly, post_twos[r] is the number of 2s in a[r+1..n].\n\nFor the subarray [l, r], the number of 1s is ones_in_subarray = sum_{i=l to r} (a[i] == 1 ? 1 : 0).\n\nSimilarly, twos_in_subarray = sum_{i=l to r} (a[i] == 2 ? 1 : 0).\n\nSo, for each [l, r], the value is pre_ones[l] + ones_in_subarray + twos_in_subarray + post_twos[r].\n\nWe can precompute pre_ones and post_twos, and for each [l, r], compute the sum as described.\n\nSo, the next step is to precompute these prefix sums.\n\nCompute pre_ones as a prefix array where pre_ones[i] is the number of 1s from a[0] to a[i-1].\n\nWait, indexes can be tricky here. Let's clarify.\n\nAssuming the array is 0-based or 1-based? It depends on how we model it.\n\nLet me assume it's 0-based for the code.\n\nWait, but in Python, the input is read as a list, probably 0-based.\n\nSo, for each l in 0..n-1, pre_ones[l] is the number of 1s in a[0..l-1].\n\nSimilarly, for r in 0..n-1, post_twos[r] is the number of 2s in a[r+1..n-1].\n\nThen, for any l and r, the number of 1s in [l..r] is sum(a[i] == 1 for i in l..r).\n\nSimilarly for 2s.\n\nBut calculating this for all l and r would take O(n^2) time, which is acceptable for n=2000.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read the input array.\n\n2. Compute the original LNDS.\n\n3. Precompute pre_ones and post_twos.\n\n4. For each l from 0 to n-1:\n\n   a. For each r from l to n-1:\n\n      i. Compute the sum s = pre_ones[l] + (number of 1s from l to r) + (number of 2s from l to r) + post_twos[r].\n\n      ii. Keep track of the maximum s.\n\n5. The answer is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum s found.\n\nWait, but how to compute the original LNDS?\n\nSince the original array is given, the LNDS can be found using a standard algorithm, which is O(n) time using patience sorting, but for n=2000, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, since the elements are only 1 and 2, the LNDS can be found by counting the maximum number of 1s followed by 2s. Because the sequence is non-decreasing, the LNDS is the minimum between the count of 1s and the count of 2s, plus the count of 2s after the last 1 or the count of 1s after the last 2, whichever is longer. Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the LNDS is the maximum number of elements that can be taken in a non-decreasing way.\n\nIn a sequence of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is equal to the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1. Because all the 1s can be taken, and then as many 2s as possible after that.\n\nWait, no. Because the 2s before the last 1 can't be included in the same non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let's think of the array as being made up of runs of 1s and 2s. The LNDS is the sum of the lengths of the first run of 1s and the last run of 2s. Because the 1s can be followed by 2s only if the 2s are after the 1s.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn the array [1,2,1,2], the runs are 1 (length 1), 2 (length 1), 1 (length 1), 2 (length 1). So the LNDS is 1 (first 1) + 1 (last 2) = 2. But wait, the actual LNDS is 3, as the subsequence [1,2,2] exists.\n\nWait, so my earlier idea is incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better way is needed.\n\nAlternative approach: the LNDS for a sequence of 1s and 2s is the maximum possible between the number of 1s and the number of 2s plus the number of 1s after the last 2, etc. No, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the LNDS can be computed as follows:\n\nThe longest non-decreasing subsequence in a sequence of 1s and 2s is the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1.\n\nBecause you can take all the 1s, then any 2s that come after the last 1.\n\nBut wait, in the array [1,2,1,2], the last 1 is at position 3 (0-based?), or is it position 2? Wait, let's see:\n\nArray indices 0:1, 1:2, 2:1, 3:2.\n\nThe last 1 is at index 2. All 2s after that are at index 3. So, the LNDS is 1 (all 1s) + 1 (the 2 after) = 2. But in reality, the LNDS is 3, as the sequence [1,2,2] is possible.\n\nSo that approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, perhaps another way: the LNDS is the maximum of the number of 1s, the number of 2s, or the sum of the 1s before the last 2 plus the 2s after that.\n\nWait, let me think of another example.\n\nExample 1: [1,2,1,2]\n\nThe LNDS is 4, as the entire array is non-decreasing after reversal.\n\nBut without reversal, it's [1,2,1,2]. The LNDS is 3, as [1,2,2] is a subsequence.\n\nSo, the initial idea of the formula is correct.\n\nWait, but how to compute the LNDS without any reversal.\n\nAn alternative approach is to compute for each position i, the maximum number of 1s before i, and the maximum number of 2s after i, and sum them, then take the maximum over all i.\n\nWait, for the first example:\n\ni=0: before 0, nothing. After 0, 3 elements. How many 2s? At positions 1,3: 2. So sum is 0 + 2 = 2.\n\ni=1: before 1, 1 (a[0]=1). After 1: positions 2,3: a[2]=1, a[3]=2. So 2s are 1 (position 3). Sum is 1 + 1=2.\n\ni=2: before 2, 2 (a[0], a[1] is 1 and 2). After 2: position 3, a[3]=2. Sum is 2 + 1=3.\n\ni=3: before 3, 2 (a[0], a[1]=2). After 3, nothing. Sum is 2 + 0=2.\n\nSo the maximum is 3, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input.\n\nSample Input 2:\n10\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1\n\nSo the array is [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1].\n\nWhat is the original LNDS? Let's see.\n\nLooking for the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nOne possible subsequence is 1,1,2,2,2,2,1, which is not non-decreasing.\n\nWait, perhaps the original LNDS is 9.\n\nWait, but the sample says that after reversing [3,7], the array becomes [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1], which has LNDS 9.\n\nWait, but the original array must have a lower LNDS than 9, so the sample's output is 9.\n\nSo the maximum after reversing is 9, which is higher than the original.\n\nSo, in the original array, the LNDS is less than 9.\n\nBut how to compute the original LNDS.\n\nWait, perhaps the original LNDS is 8.\n\nBut regardless, the point is that for the problem, we need to compute the original LNDS and compare it with the maximum possible after any reversal.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nCompute the original LNDS using a standard method.\n\nCompute for each possible [l, r], the value s = pre_ones[l] + (number of 1s in [l..r]) + (number of 2s in [l..r]) + post_twos[r].\n\nTake the maximum of all s and the original LNDS.\n\nSo, now the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and the array a.\n\n2. Compute the original LNDS.\n\n3. Precompute pre_ones and post_twos.\n\n4. For each l in 0..n-1:\n\n   a. For each r in l..n-1:\n\n      i. Compute the number of 1s in [l..r] (can be precomputed with a prefix sum array for 1s).\n\n      ii. Compute the number of 2s in [l..r] (using a prefix sum array for 2s).\n\n      iii. Compute s = pre_ones[l] + ones_in_subarray + twos_in_subarray + post_twos[r].\n\n      iv. Keep track of the maximum s.\n\n5. The answer is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum s.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, let's compute the prefix sums for 1s and 2s.\n\nprefix_1[i] = number of 1s in a[0..i-1].\n\nprefix_2[i] = number of 2s in a[0..i-1].\n\nSimilarly, for the 1s and 2s in any subarray [l..r], it's prefix_1[r+1] - prefix_1[l] for 1s, and prefix_2[r+1] - prefix_2[l] for 2s.\n\nWait, no. Because prefix_1[i] is the number of 1s up to but not including i. So, for l and r, the number of 1s from l to r is prefix_1[r+1] - prefix_1[l].\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for each l and r, the 1s in [l..r] is prefix_1[r+1] - prefix_1[l].\n\nSimilarly for 2s.\n\nSo, precompute prefix_1 and prefix_2.\n\nNext, precompute post_twos.\n\npost_twos[r] is the number of 2s in a[r+1 ... n-1].\n\nThis can be computed as prefix_2[n] - prefix_2[r+1].\n\nSo, with these precomputed, for each [l, r], we can quickly get the required values.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute the original LNDS.\n\nHow to compute the LNDS for a given array?\n\nSince the array consists of 1s and 2s, perhaps there's a way to compute it efficiently.\n\nLet me think: the LNDS is the maximum number of elements that can be taken in a non-decreasing order.\n\nIn a sequence of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s plus the maximum number of 2s that come after some point.\n\nWait, perhaps the LNDS is the maximum between:\n\n- The number of 1s in the array.\n\n- The number of 2s in the array.\n\n- The maximum number of 1s before some position i plus the number of 2s after i.\n\nBecause the 1s before i can be followed by 2s after i, forming a non-decreasing sequence.\n\nSo, for each position i, compute (number of 1s up to i) + (number of 2s from i+1 to end). The maximum of these values across all i is the original LNDS.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the steps to compute the original LNDS are:\n\n1. Precompute prefix_1, which is the number of 1s up to each position.\n\n2. For each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   a. The number of 1s up to i is prefix_1[i+1].\n\n   b. The number of 2s after i is (total_2 - prefix_2[i+1]).\n\n   c. The sum is (a) + (b). Keep track of the maximum sum.\n\n3. The maximum sum is the original LNDS.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the array a as a list of integers.\n\nCompute prefix_1 and prefix_2.\n\nCompute the original LNDS as described.\n\nCompute for all possible l and r the s = pre_ones[l] + (prefix_1[r+1] - prefix_1[l]) + (prefix_2[r+1] - prefix_2[l]) + (post_twos[r]).\n\nFind the maximum s.\n\nThe final answer is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum s.\n\nNow, let's test this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4\n\n1 2 1 2\n\nCompute prefix_1 and prefix_2:\n\nprefix_1[0] = 0\n\nprefix_1[1] = 1 (a[0] is 1)\n\nprefix_1[2] = 1 (a[1] is 2)\n\nprefix_1[3] = 2 (a[2] is 1)\n\nprefix_1[4] = 2 (a[3] is 2)\n\nprefix_2[0] = 0\n\nprefix_2[1] = 0 (a[0]=1)\n\nprefix_2[2] = 1 (a[1]=2)\n\nprefix_2[3] = 1 (a[2]=1)\n\nprefix_2[4] = 2 (a[3]=2)\n\nTotal_2 = 2.\n\nCompute original LNDS:\n\nFor each i in 0..3:\n\ni=0:\n\nprefix_1[1] = 1 (up to 0)\n\ntwos_after = total_2 - prefix_2[1] = 2 - 0 = 2.\n\nsum = 1+2=3.\n\ni=1:\n\nprefix_1[2]=1.\n\ntwos_after = 2 - prefix_2[2] = 2-1=1.\n\nsum=1+1=2.\n\ni=2:\n\nprefix_1[3]=2.\n\ntwos_after = 2 - prefix_2[3] = 2-1=1.\n\nsum=2+1=3.\n\ni=3:\n\nprefix_1[4]=2.\n\ntwos_after = 2 - prefix_2[4] = 2-2=0.\n\nsum=2+0=2.\n\nSo, the maximum is 3, which is the original LNDS.\n\nNow, compute all [l, r]:\n\nWe need to find the [l, r] that maximizes s = pre_ones[l] + (ones_in_subarray) + (twos_in_subarray) + post_twos[r].\n\npre_ones[l] is the number of 1s before l. Since l ranges from 0 to 3, pre_ones is:\n\npre_ones[0] = 0.\n\npre_ones[1] = 1 (number of 1s before index 1).\n\npre_ones[2] =1.\n\npre_ones[3] =1.\n\npost_twos[r] is the number of 2s after r.\n\nr can be from 0 to 3.\n\nFor r=0: post_twos[0] = total_2 - prefix_2[1] = 2 - 0 = 2.\n\nr=1: post_twos[1] = 2 - prefix_2[2] = 2-1=1.\n\nr=2: 2 - prefix_2[3] = 2-1=1.\n\nr=3: 2 - prefix_2[4] = 2-2=0.\n\nNow, for each [l, r], compute s.\n\nLet's go through all possible l and r.\n\nn=4, so l ranges from 0 to 3, r >= l.\n\nCase 1: l=0, r=0.\n\ns = pre_ones[0] (0) + (a[0] is 1 → 1) + (a[0] is not 2 → 0) + post_twos[0] (2).\n\ns=0+1+0+2=3.\n\nCase 2: l=0, r=1.\n\ns=pre_ones[0] (0) + (a[0]+a[1] → 1+0=1) + (0+1=1) + post_twos[1] (1).\n\ns=0+1+1+1=3.\n\nCase 3: l=0, r=2.\n\ns=0 + (a[0]+a[1]+a[2] →1+0+1=2) + (0+1+0=1) + post_twos[2] (1).\n\ns=0+2+1+1=4.\n\nWhich is the maximum in this case.\n\nCase 4: l=0, r=3.\n\ns=0 + (a[0]...a[3] → 1+0+1+0=2) + (0+1+0+1=2) + post_twos[3] (0).\n\ns=0+2+2+0=4.\n\nSo, for l=0, r=2 gives s=4, which is the maximum.\n\nOther cases:\n\nl=1, r=1:\n\ns=pre_ones[1] (1) + a[1]=2 → 0 ones, 1 two → 1 (twos_in_subarray) + post_twos[1] (1). So 1+0+1+1=3.\n\nl=1, r=2:\n\ns=1 + (a[1]+a[2]=2+1 → 0+1=1) + (1+0=1) + post_twos[2]=1.\n\ns=1+1+1+1=4.\n\nl=1, r=3:\n\ns=1 + (a[1]+a[2]+a[3] → 2+1+2 → 0+1+1=2) + (1+1=2) + post_twos[3]=0 → 1+2+2+0=5.\n\nWait, that's 5, which is higher.\n\nWait, but according to the sample, the maximum after reversal is 4, but according to this calculation, it's 5.\n\nHmm, that suggests a mistake in the logic.\n\nWait, what's the reversed subarray for l=1, r=3?\n\nThe subarray is a[1..3] → [2,1,2]. Reversing it gives [2,1,2] → wait, no, reversing [2,1,2] would give [2,1,2]? Or is it [2,1,2] reversed becomes [2,1,2]?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the subarray [2,1,2] reversed is [2,1,2]? Or am I getting this wrong.\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nOriginal subarray [2,1,2], reversing it would give [2,1,2]? No, wait, no. Wait, no—reversing [2,1,2] would become [2,1,2]?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the subarray is positions 1,2,3: a[1]=2, a[2]=1, a[3]=2.\n\nReversed, it becomes [2,1,2] → wait, no: reversed would be [2,1,2] → wait, no. Wait, the order is reversed. So the first element becomes last, etc.\n\nSo, the reversed subarray is [2,1,2] → wait, no, the original is [2,1,2], reversed would be [2,1,2] → no, that's the same as original. So, the reversed subarray is [2,1,2], which is the same as the original.\n\nSo, after reversal, the array becomes [1,2,2,2]. Wait, no.\n\nWait, original array is [1,2,1,2]. Reversing [1,2,3] (indices 1,2,3) would change the subarray [2,1,2] into [2,1,2]. Wait, that's not right. Oh, no, wait—reversing the subarray [2,1,2] would result in [2,1,2], which is the same as before. So, the array remains the same, but that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in thinking. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, the subarray is [2,1,2]. Reversing it would give [2,1,2]? No, that's not right. Wait, reversing a list [a,b,c] gives [c,b,a]. So, [2,1,2] reversed is [2,1,2] → no, that's not correct. Wait, no, [2,1,2] reversed is [2,1,2] → no, wait, wait: [2,1,2] reversed is [2,1,2]?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the list [2,1,2] when reversed becomes [2,1,2]? That's only true if the list is a palindrome. But in this case, it's not. Wait, 2,1,2 → reversed is 2,1,2. Yes, because the first element is 2, last is 2; middle is 1. So the reversed list is the same as the original.\n\nSo, in this case, the array remains the same, and the LNDS is still 3.\n\nBut according to our calculation, for l=1, r=3, s is 1+2+2+0=5.\n\nWait, but that's impossible. So, where did I go wrong.\n\nWait, the s is pre_ones[l] + ones_in_subarray + twos_in_subarray + post_twos[r].\n\nFor l=1, r=3:\n\npre_ones[1] is 1.\n\nones_in_subarray: a[1..3] are 2,1,2 → 1 one.\n\ntwos_in_subarray: 2.\n\npost_twos[r=3] is 0.\n\nSo s = 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 =4.\n\nAh, yes, I think I made a mistake in adding the numbers earlier.\n\nWait, the previous calculation said that for l=1, r=3, the s is 5. But that's incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct calculation is:\n\npre_ones[1] = 1.\n\nones_in_subarray = a[1..3] has 1 (only a[2] is 1).\n\ntwos_in_subarray = 2 (a[1]=2, a[3]=2).\n\npost_twos[r=3] =0.\n\nSo s=1+1+2+0=4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, for l=0, r=2, s=4.\n\nOther cases:\n\nl=2, r=3:\n\npre_ones[2] =1.\n\nones_in_subarray = a[2..3] is 1 and 2 → 1.\n\ntwos",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray of a given sequence. The sequence consists of 1s and 2s, where 1 represents a performer holding the rod low and 2 represents holding it high.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Prefix Sums**: Compute prefix sums for the number of 1s and 2s up to each position in the array. This helps in quickly calculating the number of 1s and 2s in any subarray.\n2. **Original LNDS Calculation**: Calculate the original LNDS without any reversal by considering the maximum number of 1s before any position and the number of 2s after that position.\n3. **Evaluate Reversals**: For each possible subarray [l, r], compute the potential LNDS after reversing this subarray. The formula used is:\n   \\[\n   s = \\text{pre\\_ones}[l] + (\\text{number of 1s in } [l..r]) + (\\text{number of 2s in } [l..r]) + \\text{post\\_twos}[r]\n   \\]\n4. **Maximize LNDS**: Track the maximum value of `s` across all possible subarrays and compare it with the original LNDS to get the final result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nn = len(a)\n\nprefix_1 = [0] * (n + 1)\nprefix_2 = [0] * (n + 1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix_1[i+1] = prefix_1[i] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n    prefix_2[i+1] = prefix_2[i] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)\n\ntotal_2 = prefix_2[n]\n\ndef compute_original_LNDS():\n    max_len = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        ones_before = prefix_1[i]\n        twos_after = total_2 - prefix_2[i+1]\n        current_sum = ones_before + twos_after\n        if current_sum > max_len:\n            max_len = current_sum\n    return max_len\n\noriginal_LNDS = compute_original_LNDS()\n\nmax_s = 0\nfor l in range(n):\n    for r in range(l, n):\n        ones_sub = prefix_1[r+1] - prefix_1[l]\n        twos_sub = prefix_2[r+1] - prefix_2[l]\n        post_twos_r = total_2 - prefix_2[r+1]\n        s = prefix_1[l] + ones_sub + twos_sub + post_twos_r\n        if s > max_s:\n            max_s = s\n\nresult = max(original_LNDS, max_s)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Prefix Sums**: We use two arrays, `prefix_1` and `prefix_2`, to store the cumulative counts of 1s and 2s respectively up to each index. This allows us to quickly compute the count of 1s and 2s in any subarray.\n2. **Original LNDS Calculation**: By iterating through each position, we calculate the maximum possible LNDS by considering all 1s before a position and all 2s after that position.\n3. **Reversal Evaluation**: For each possible subarray, we compute the potential LNDS after reversal using the precomputed prefix sums. This involves summing the counts of 1s and 2s in the subarray and combining them with the counts from the prefix and suffix of the subarray.\n4. **Result Determination**: The maximum value obtained from evaluating all possible subarrays is compared with the original LNDS to determine the final result.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired result by leveraging prefix sums and considering all possible subarray reversals, ensuring optimal performance even for the maximum constraint.",
