Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Leha who wants to split his vacation into two parts using two vouchers. The goal is to find the minimal total cost of such two vouchers that don't overlap and their durations add up exactly to x.\n\nHmm, let's break down the problem.\n\nSo, each voucher has a start day li, end day ri, and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. We need to choose two different vouchers i and j such that:\n\n1. Their durations sum to exactly x.\n2. They don't intersect. That means either the end of one is before the start of the other, or vice versa.\n3. The total cost is as minimal as possible.\n\nIf no such pair exists, we output -1.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this efficiently. Since n can be up to 2*10^5, any O(n^2) approach would be way too slow. So we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the steps needed:\n\n1. For each voucher, calculate its duration. Then, for each voucher, we can look for another voucher whose duration is exactly x minus this duration.\n\n2. But how do we efficiently find such vouchers that don't overlap with the current one?\n\nWait, but even if we can find all possible pairs where durations add up to x, checking whether they are non-overlapping could take time. So perhaps we can pre-process the vouchers in some way.\n\nAnother idea: group vouchers by their duration. For each voucher, compute what duration it needs (x - current_duration), then look for vouchers with that duration that don't overlap with it.\n\nBut how do we check for non-overlapping efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, for each voucher i, we can find all vouchers j with duration d = x - duration_i, and then check if they are non-overlapping and keep track of the minimal cost.\n\nBut again, for each i, finding j's could be expensive if not done properly.\n\nWait, maybe we can sort the vouchers based on their end times. Then, for a given voucher i, all possible j's that end before i start can be found quickly using binary search. Similarly, those that start after i ends can be found quickly.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n- Precompute the duration for each voucher.\n\n- Create a dictionary mapping each duration to a list of vouchers. So for each duration d, we have all vouchers with that duration.\n\n- Also, create a sorted list of all vouchers' end times, along with their index or something else needed.\n\nWait, maybe for each voucher, we can store li, ri, cost, and duration. Then, for each voucher i, we can look for vouchers j where duration_j is x - duration_i. Then, among these j's, we need to find those that either end before i starts or start after i ends.\n\nBut how to efficiently find such j's.\n\nPerhaps, for each duration d, we can have two lists:\n\n- A list of vouchers ending before a certain time.\n\n- And a list of vouchers starting after a certain time.\n\nWait, no. Alternatively, for each duration d, we can have a sorted list of the end times of all vouchers with duration d. Then, for a given voucher i, which has duration d_i, we need to find j's with duration d_j = x - d_i. Then, we can check if j's end time is <= i's start time, or j's start time is >= i's end time.\n\nWait, but for j's that end before i starts, we can perform a binary search on the sorted end times of duration_j to find all j's where end <= i_li. Similarly, for j's that start after i ends, we can look for j's where start >= i_ri.\n\nSo here's the detailed approach:\n\n1. For each voucher, compute its duration (ri - li + 1).\n\n2. Create a dictionary where for each duration d, we have a list of all vouchers with that duration. Each entry in this list should include li, ri, and cost.\n\n3. For each voucher i:\n\n   a. Compute the required duration d_j = x - duration_i. If d_j is negative, skip.\n\n   b. Check if d_j is present in our dictionary.\n\n   c. For each voucher j in the d_j list:\n\n      i. Check if j and i don't overlap. How?\n\n      Either j ends before i starts: j_ri <= i_li\n\n      Or j starts after i ends: j_li >= i_ri\n\n      If either condition is true, then consider the sum of costs.\n\n      Keep track of the minimum sum found.\n\n4. However, step 3c could be O(n) per voucher, which is O(n^2) overall. That's not feasible for n=2e5.\n\nSo, we need a",
