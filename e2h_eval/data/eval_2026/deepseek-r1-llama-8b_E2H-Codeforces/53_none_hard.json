Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

The function uses a helper function `helper` to check if a substring of a given length can be met in the string at least twice.\n\nThe main function iterates over all possible lengths from 1 to the length of the string and checks if a substring of each length can be met in the string at least twice using the `helper` function. If it finds a length for which a substring can be met in the string at least twice, it returns this length. If no such length is found, it returns 0.\n\nFinally, the script reads the input string from standard input and prints the result.",
