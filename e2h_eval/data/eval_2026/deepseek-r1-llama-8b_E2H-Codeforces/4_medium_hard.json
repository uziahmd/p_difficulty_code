The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this Rock-Paper-Scissors problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that Nikephoros and Polycarpus are playing n rounds of rock-paper-scissors. In each round, they choose their move from their respective sequences A and B, cycling through them. If one wins, the loser gets a red spot. We need to count how many red spots each has after n rounds.\n\nHmm, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the input gives n, then two strings A and B. Each character is 'R', 'S', or 'P'. For each of the n rounds, we determine who wins based on their current choices. Then, increment the respective counters.\n\nWait, but how do we get their choices for each round? Because the sequences are cycled. So for each i-th round, the choice for Nikephoros is A[i % m], and similarly for Polycarpus as B[i % k], where m and k are the lengths of A and B respectively.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each round from 0 to n-1:\n   a. Get the move for N from A: a = A[i % len(A)]\n   b. Get the move for P from B: b = B[i % len(B)]\n   c. Determine the winner between a and b.\n   d. If N wins, P gets a spot. Else if P wins, N gets a spot. Else, no one gets a spot.\n   e. Increment the respective counters.\n\nBut wait, how to determine the winner?\n\nLet me think about the rules:\n\n- Rock beats scissors.\n- Scissors beat paper.\n- Paper beats rock.\n\nSo, for any two moves a and b, we can determine who wins.\n\nI need a function that, given a and b, returns whether a beats b, which would mean the other player loses.\n\nAlternatively, for each pair (a, b), we can precompute who wins.\n\nAnother approach: create a helper function that returns 1 if a beats b, -1 if b beats a, 0 if it's a tie.\n\nYes, that's a good idea.\n\nSo, for each a and b in each round, compute the result.\n\nNow, considering that n can be up to 2e5, but the sequences are up to 1000 characters each, the total number of possible (a, b) pairs is 3*3=9, but since the sequences can be up to 1000, the per-round computation is O(1), so overall it's O(n) time, which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n- Read n, A, B.\n- Initialize counters: nike = 0, poly = 0.\n- For each round i from 0 to n-1:\n   - Get a = A[i % lenA]\n   - Get b = B[i % lenB]\n   - Determine outcome.\n   - Update counters accordingly.\n- After all rounds, output the two counters.\n\nNow, the main part is implementing the outcome function correctly.\n\nLet's think about all possible cases.\n\nCase 1: a == b. No one gets a spot.\n\nCase 2: a beats b:\n   - If a is R and b is S → N wins, P gets a spot?\n   Wait, no. If N's move wins, then P loses, so P gets a spot. Or wait, wait. The problem says the winner gives the loser a pinch. So if N's move beats P's, then N wins, P gets a spot. Similarly, if P's move beats N's, N gets a spot.\n\nSo, the logic is:\n\nif a beats b → P gets a spot → add 1 to poly's count.\n\nif b beats a → N gets a spot → add 1 to nike's count.\n\nElse, nothing.\n\nSo, the helper function should return which move wins.\n\nLet me create a function:\n\ndef get_winner(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return None  # no winner\n    # else, determine who wins\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        return 'N'  # N's move wins\n    else:\n        return 'P'  # P's move wins\n\nWait, wait. Let's test this.\n\nIf a is R and b is S: R beats S → N wins → P gets a spot.\n\nIf a is S and b is P: S beats P → N wins → P gets a spot.\n\nIf a is P and b is R: P beats R → N wins → P gets a spot.\n\nWait, no! Wait, if a is P and b is R: P beats R, so N's move is P, which beats R, so N wins. So P's player (Poly) loses, so Poly gets a spot.\n\nWait, no, wait. The problem says that the winner gives the loser a pinch. So if N's move is P, and P's move is R, then P's move (R) beats N's (P). So P's move wins, so N loses, so N gets a spot.\n\nWait, maybe I have the condition reversed.\n\nLet me re-express the rules.\n\nRock (R) beats Scissors (S).\n\nScissors (S) beats Paper (P).\n\nPaper (P) beats Rock (R).\n\nSo, when comparing a and b:\n\nIf a beats b, then N wins, so Poly gets a spot.\n\nIf b beats a, then P wins, so N gets a spot.\n\nSo, the helper function needs to determine whether a beats b, else b beats a.\n\nSo, let's code:\n\nif a == 'R' and b == 'S' → a beats b → N wins.\n\nelif a == 'S' and b == 'P' → a beats b → N wins.\n\nelif a == 'P' and b == 'R' → a beats b → N wins.\n\nElse, check if b beats a.\n\nWhich would be:\n\nb == 'R' and a == 'S' → b beats a → P wins.\n\nb == 'S' and a == 'P' → b beats a → P wins.\n\nb == 'P' and a == 'R' → b beats a → P wins.\n\nSo, the helper function could be written as:\n\nif a == b:\n    return 0  # no one gets a spot\nelse:\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        return 1  # N wins, Poly gets a spot.\n    else:\n        return -1  # P wins, N gets a spot.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the outcome as:\n\nFor each round, the winner is determined. If N's move is winning, Poly gets a spot. Else, N gets a spot.\n\nSo, the function can return which player gets a spot.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor each round:\n\na = A[i % lenA]\n\nb = B[i % lenB]\n\nif a beats b:\n\n   poly +=1\n\nelse:\n\n   if b beats a:\n\n      nike +=1\n\n   else:\n\n      pass (same move, nothing)\n\nSo, the function can return whether N or P wins, then based on that, add to the respective counter.\n\nSo, perhaps the function can return 1 if N wins (poly increases), -1 if P wins (nike increases), 0 otherwise.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the helper function:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return 0\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        return 1  # N's move wins, Poly gets a spot.\n\n    else:\n\n        return -1  # P's move wins, N gets a spot.\n\nWait, wait, let's test this function.\n\nTest case 1:\n\na = 'R', b = 'S' → a beats b → function returns 1 → Poly gets a spot. Correct.\n\nTest case 2:\n\na = 'S', b = 'P' → a beats b → returns 1 → correct.\n\nTest case 3:\n\na = 'P', b = 'R' → a beats b → returns 1 → correct.\n\nWhat about when a is 'R' and b is 'P'?\n\nThen, b beats a. So function returns -1 → N gets a spot. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, if a is 'S' and b is 'R': b beats a → function returns -1 → N gets a spot.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the helper function seems correct.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nRead n, A, B.\n\nCompute lenA = len(A), lenB = len(B).\n\nInitialize nike = 0, poly = 0.\n\nFor i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   a = A[ i % lenA ]\n\n   b = B[ i % lenB ]\n\n   res = get_result(a, b)\n\n   if res == 1:\n\n       poly +=1\n\n   elif res == -1:\n\n       nike +=1\n\n   else:\n\n       pass\n\nAfter processing all rounds, print nike and poly.\n\nSo, now, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nWait, the input is in the example as ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR'], but perhaps it's a typo.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the user wrote:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, but the second line is the sequence A, third is B. So A is 'RPS', B is 'RSPP'.\n\nLet's process each round.\n\nRound 0:\n\ni=0\n\na = A[0] = 'R'\n\nb = B[0] = 'R' → same, no spots.\n\nRound 1:\n\ni=1\n\na = A[1] = 'P'\n\nb = B[1] = 'S' → P vs S. P beats S? Wait, no: S beats P. So a is P, b is S.\n\nWait, what's the condition for a to beat b.\n\nIn the helper function:\n\na is P, b is S.\n\nCheck if P beats S.\n\nWait, according to the rules, does P beat S? No. Because S beats P.\n\nWait, no. Wait, S beats P. So when a is P and b is S, then b beats a.\n\nSo in this case, a is P, b is S → b beats a. So P's move wins, so N gets a spot.\n\nWait, but in the sample explanation, round 2 (I think it's the second round) was P vs S, and N lost, meaning he got a spot.\n\nSo for this round, N gets a spot.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nRound 0: R vs R → no.\n\nRound 1: P vs S → S beats P. So P's move (S) beats N's (P), so N gets a spot.\n\nSo for i=1, res is -1 → N gets a spot.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the sample.\n\nSample Explanation:\n\nThe first sample game went like this:\n\nRound 1: R-R: Draw.\n\nRound 2: P-S: N loses → Poly gets a spot.\n\nWait, no: N's move is P, P loses to S because S beats P. So in this case, P's move (S) beats N's (P). So N's move is P, which is beaten by S. So P (Poly) wins, so N gets a spot.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if N's move is P and Poly's move is S, then S beats P. So N's move loses, so Poly's move wins → N gets a spot.\n\nSo in this case, for the second round, N's move is P, Poly's is S → P's move is S, which beats N's P. So N loses, gets a spot.\n\nSo in the sample, in round 2, N gets a spot.\n\nSo in our helper function, for a='P', b='S', what is returned?\n\nget_result('P','S'):\n\nSince P != S.\n\nCheck if P beats S: P is not R, not S, not P... Wait, P is paper. Does paper beat scissors? No, scissors beat paper.\n\nSo a is P, b is S → b beats a → so function returns -1 → N gets a spot.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo in the sample, for each round:\n\nRound 0: R vs R → 0.\n\nRound 1: P vs S → P is beaten by S → res is -1 → N gets 1.\n\nRound 2: S vs P → S beats P → res is 1 → Poly gets 1.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWait, round 2 in the sample explanation is the third round, I think.\n\nWait, the sample explanation lists seven rounds:\n\nRound 1: R - R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P - S → N loses.\n\nRound 3: S - P → P loses.\n\nRound 4: R - P → P loses.\n\nRound 5: P - R → R loses.\n\nRound 6: S - S → draw.\n\nRound 7: R - P → P loses.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nBut perhaps the sample's actual rounds are:\n\nEach round is processed as i from 0 to 6 (since n=7).\n\nLet me try to list each round:\n\ni=0: a=A[0] = R, b=B[0]=R → same, no spot.\n\ni=1: a=P, b=S → S beats P → res=-1 → N gets a spot.\n\ni=2: a=S, b=P → S beats P → res=1 → Poly gets a spot.\n\ni=3: a=R, b=R → same.\n\ni=4: a=P, b=P → same.\n\ni=5: a=S, b=R → R beats S → a is S, b is R. Does S beat R? No. Because R beats S. So a is S, b is R → R beats S → res is -1 → N gets a spot.\n\ni=6: a=R, b=P → R beats P → res=1 → Poly gets a spot.\n\nWait, but in the sample explanation, the final scores are N:3, P:2.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nRound 0: no.\n\nRound 1: N gets 1.\n\nRound 2: Poly gets 1.\n\nRound 3: no.\n\nRound4: no.\n\nRound5: N gets 1.\n\nRound6: Poly gets 1.\n\nSo total N: 1+1+1=3, Poly:1+1=2.\n\nYes, matches the sample.\n\nSo the helper function works.\n\nSo, the code structure is clear.\n\nNow, about handling the input.\n\nIn Python, the input is read via stdin. So, for each test case, the input will be read as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nBut sometimes, the input may contain leading or trailing spaces, but in this problem, the strings consist only of 'R', 'S', 'P', so we can safely strip.\n\nSo, code:\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nlenA = len(A)\nlenB = len(B)\n\nnike = 0\npoly = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a = A[i % lenA]\n    b = B[i % lenB]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        poly +=1\n    else:\n        nike +=1\n\nprint(nike, poly)\n\nWait, that's the code. Let's test it against the sample.\n\nSample Input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nProcessing:\n\nA is 'RPS' → lenA=3.\n\nB is 'RSPP' → lenB=4.\n\nFor i from 0 to 6:\n\ni=0:\n\na = A[0] = R, b = B[0] = R → same, no.\n\ni=1:\n\na=A[1%3=1] = P, b=B[1%4=1] = S → P vs S. Check if P beats S. No, S beats P. So else clause: add to N. So N gets 1.\n\ni=2:\n\na=A[2%3=2] = S, b=B[2%4=2] = P → S vs P → S beats P → add to Poly. Poly=1.\n\ni=3:\n\na=A[3%3=0] = R, b=B[3%4=3] = P → R vs P → R beats P. So add to Poly. Poly=2.\n\ni=4:\n\na=A[4%3=1] = P, b=B[4%4=0] = R → P vs R. R beats P. So else: add to N. Now N=2.\n\ni=5:\n\na=A[5%3=2] = S, b=B[5%4=1] = S → same, no.\n\ni=6:\n\na=A[6%3=0] = R, b=B[6%4=2] = P → R vs P → R beats P. Add to Poly. Poly=3.\n\nSo, N's count is 2, Poly's is 3.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the output is 3 2.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. What's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the code.\n\nWait, in the sample, the output is 3 2, but according to my code, I'm getting 2 and 3.\n\nWait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the way the helper function is implemented.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the sample.\n\nIn the sample, the seven rounds:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → no spots.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → P loses → Poly gets a spot.\n\nRound 3: S vs P → S beats P → N wins, so Poly gets a spot.\n\nRound 4: R vs P → R beats P → N wins, so Poly gets a spot.\n\nRound 5: P vs R → R beats P → N gets a spot.\n\nRound 6: S vs S → no.\n\nRound 7: R vs P → R beats P → N wins, Poly gets a spot.\n\nWait, but n=7, so i runs from 0 to 6, which is 7 rounds.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting the order wrong.\n\nLet me re-calculate step by step.\n\nLet me list each i from 0 to 6, a and b, and the outcome.\n\ni | a | b | outcome | who gets spot\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\n0 | R | R → same → none.\n1 | P | S → S beats P → N gets a spot → N=1.\n2 | S | P → S beats P → Poly gets a spot → Poly=1.\n3 | R | P → R beats P → Poly gets a spot → Poly=2.\n4 | P | R → R beats P → N gets a spot → N=2.\n5 | S | S → same → none.\n6 | R | P → R beats P → Poly gets a spot → Poly=3.\n\nSo, total N=2, Poly=3.\n\nBut the sample output is 3 2.\n\nHmm, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the helper function.\n\nWait, in the helper function, for a='P' and b='S':\n\na is P, b is S.\n\nDoes P beat S? No. Because S beats P.\n\nSo, in this case, b beats a → so P's move wins, so N gets a spot.\n\nWait, no: if a is P and b is S, then P is beaten by S, so P's move loses. So the winner is b's move (S), so the loser is a (P). So a's player (N) gets a spot.\n\nSo, for i=1, the outcome is that N's move is P, and Poly's is S.\n\nSince S beats P, Poly's move wins, so N gets a spot. So yes, N=1.\n\nBut in the sample, in round 2, N loses again.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample's explanation is for the rounds 1 to 7, but in the code, i is 0-based, so for n=7, it's 0-6.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the sample's rounds wrong.\n\nWait, the sample's explanation says:\n\nIn the first sample the game went like this:\n\n1. R - R: Draw.\n\n2. P - S: N loses.\n\n3. S - P: P loses.\n\n4. R - P: N loses.\n\n5. P - R: P loses.\n\n6. S - S: Draw.\n\n7. R - P: N loses.\n\nWait, so that's 7 rounds, each with the respective outcome.\n\nSo, in the code, for i=0 to 6:\n\ni=0: round 1.\n\ni=1: round 2.\n\ni=2: round 3.\n\ni=3: round4.\n\ni=4: round5.\n\ni=5: round6.\n\ni=6: round7.\n\nSo, for each round:\n\nRound 1 (i=0): R-R → no.\n\nRound 2 (i=1): P vs S → N loses → N=1.\n\nRound3 (i=2): S vs P → S beats P → Poly gets spot → Poly=1.\n\nRound4 (i=3): R vs P → R beats P → Poly gets spot → Poly=2.\n\nRound5 (i=4): P vs R → R beats P → N gets spot → N=2.\n\nRound6 (i=5): S vs S → no.\n\nRound7 (i=6): R vs P → R beats P → Poly gets spot → Poly=3.\n\nSo, N has 2, Poly has 3.\n\nBut the sample expects N to have 3, Poly 2.\n\nHmm, so why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I swapped the players.\n\nWait, the problem says that the winner gives the loser a spot.\n\nSo, when N's move is winning, the loser is P → P gets a spot.\n\nWait, no: in the scenario where a beats b, the winner is N, so P loses, thus P gets a spot.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, when a beats b: N's move is a, which beats b. So P's move is b, which loses. So P is the loser, gets a spot.\n\nYes, so when a beats b → P gets a spot.\n\nWhen b beats a → N's move is a, which loses to b. So N is the loser, gets a spot.\n\nSo, for a = 'P' and b='S', a is beaten by b → so N's move is a (P), which is beaten by b (S) → so N is the loser, gets a spot.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in the code, for a='P' and b='S', the function returns 1, meaning Poly gets a spot.\n\nWait, but in the sample, in round 2, N's move is P, which is beaten by S. So N is the loser, so he gets a spot.\n\nSo for i=1, the code adds 1 to Poly, but according to the helper function, it's returning 1 when a beats b.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the helper function wrong.\n\nWait, the helper function returns 1 when a beats b → Poly gets a spot.\n\nBut in the case of a='P' and b='S', a does not beat b.\n\nWait, no: a is P, b is S. P does not beat S. So the helper function returns -1.\n\nBecause, in the helper function:\n\nif a is 'P' and b is 'S', then a does not beat b. So the else clause is executed, returning -1 → N gets a spot.\n\nWait, so perhaps the helper function is incorrect.\n\nWait, the helper function is:\n\nif a == b: return 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   if (a == R and b == S) ... → return 1.\n\n   else: return -1.\n\nBut for a='P' and b='S', a is P, which is not R nor S in the winning conditions.\n\nWait, because 'P' is paper, which is beaten by S.\n\nSo, the condition (a == 'P' and b == 'R') is not met. So in the helper function, a is P, b is S → the condition is not met, so it goes to else, returns -1.\n\nSo, in the code, for a='P' and b='S', the helper function returns -1 → N gets a spot.\n\nWait, but that's conflicting with earlier reasoning.\n\nWait, no. When a is P, b is S → S beats P.\n\nSo, b's move is S, which beats a's P → so P's player (Poly) wins, so N gets a spot.\n\nSo, the helper function returns -1 → which means N gets a spot.\n\nSo, for i=1, the outcome is -1 → N gets a spot.\n\nSo, in the code, the code is adding 1 to N's count.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, in round 2, N loses, so gets a spot.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nBut according to the code, for the sample, N's count is 2, Poly's is 3.\n\nBut the sample expects N to have 3, Poly 2.\n\nSo something is wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the helper function reversed.\n\nWait, perhaps the helper function should return 1 when N wins, so P gets a spot.\n\nWait, when a beats b, N's move is a, which wins, so P gets a spot. So helper function returns 1 → which indicates P gets a spot.\n\nBut in the code, when res is 1, it adds to Poly's count.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, when a beats b, res is 1 → P gets a spot.\n\nWhen b beats a, res is -1 → N gets a spot.\n\nSo, for the sample:\n\ni=1: a=P, b=S → S beats P → res is -1 → N gets a spot.\n\ni=2: a=S, b=P → S beats P → res is 1 → P gets a spot.\n\ni=3: a=R, b=P → R beats P → res is 1 → P gets a spot.\n\ni=4: a=P, b=R → R beats P → res is -1 → N gets a spot.\n\ni=6: a=R, b=P → R beats P → res is 1 → P gets a spot.\n\nSo, let's recalculate the counts:\n\nRound 0: 0.\n\nRound 1: res=-1 → N=1.\n\nRound 2: res=1 → Poly=1.\n\nRound3: res=1 → Poly=2.\n\nRound4: res=-1 → N=2.\n\nRound5: same → no.\n\nRound6: res=1 → Poly=3.\n\nSo, total N=2, Poly=3.\n\nBut the sample expects N=3, Poly=2.\n\nHmm, that suggests that my code is computing the opposite.\n\nSo, perhaps I have the helper function inverted.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the helper function should return 1 when N's move wins, and -1 when it loses.\n\nBut in that case, for a beats b, N wins, so Poly gets a spot.\n\nSo, res=1 → add to Poly.\n\nres=-1 → add to N.\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo perhaps the sample's explanation is wrong, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample.\n\nLooking at the sample explanation again:\n\nIn the first sample, the rounds are as follows:\n\n1. R - R: Draw.\n\n2. P - S: N loses.\n\n3. S - P: P loses.\n\n4. R - P: N loses.\n\n5. P - R: P loses.\n\n6. S - S: Draw.\n\n7. R - P: N loses.\n\nSo, for these seven rounds:\n\nRound 2: N loses → spot count for N is 1.\n\nRound3: P loses → spot count for P is 1.\n\nRound4: N loses → spot count N=2.\n\nRound5: P loses → P=2.\n\nRound7: N loses → N=3.\n\nSo, in total, N has 3, P has 2.\n\nSo, the code is not matching this.\n\nSo why is this happening?\n\nBecause the code is not considering all the rounds correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not accounting for the correct a and b for each round.\n\nLet me re-express the A and B sequences.\n\nA is 'RPS' → R, P, S.\n\nB is 'RSPP' → R, S, P, P.\n\nSo, for each i from 0 to 6:\n\ni | a | b\n0 → R (A[0]) | R (B[0]) → same → no.\n\ni=1 → A[1%3=1] → P. B[1%4=1] → S. So a=P, b=S.\n\nIn this case, S beats P → so N's move is P, which loses → N gets a spot.\n\ni=2 → A[2%3=2] → S. B[2%4=2] → P. a=S, b=P. S beats P → N's move wins, so Poly gets a spot.\n\ni=3 → A[3%3=0] → R. B[3%4=3] → P. R beats P → N's move wins, Poly gets a spot.\n\ni=4 → A[4%3=1] → P. B[4%4=0] → R. P vs R. R beats P → N's move loses → N gets a spot.\n\ni=5 → A[5%3=2] → S. B[5%4=1] → S. Same → no.\n\ni=6 → A[6%3=0] → R. B[6%4=2] → P. R beats P → N's move wins, Poly gets a spot.\n\nSo, the outcomes are:\n\ni=1 → N gets 1.\n\ni=2 → P gets 1.\n\ni=3 → P gets 2.\n\ni=4 → N gets 2.\n\ni=6 → P gets 3.\n\nSo, N has 2, P has 3.\n\nBut sample expects N=3, P=2.\n\nThis is conflicting.\n\nSo, perhaps I have a bug in the code.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm using i % lenA and i % lenB, but for some reason, the mod is applied differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use i % lenA and i % lenB, but perhaps the indices are 0-based or 1-based.\n\nNo, in the code, the indices are 0-based, as the strings are accessed with [i], starting from 0.\n\nWait, perhaps in the sample, the A is 'RPS' which is 3 letters, so the indices are 0,1,2, and then wrap around.\n\nSame for B.\n\nSo, perhaps I'm processing the rounds correctly.\n\nBut according to the sample, the code's calculation is N=2, P=3, but sample expects N=3, P=2.\n\nSo, something is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a round.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm processing i from 0 to n-1, which is 0-6 for n=7.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, it's 7 rounds, numbered 1-7.\n\nSo, perhaps the code is correct, but the sample explanation is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the helper function is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should swap the way the results are handled.\n\nWait, perhaps when a beats b, the loser is P, so P gets a spot. So, when a beats b, we add to Poly.\n\nSo, the helper function is correct.\n\nBut in the sample, the code is computing 2 and 3, but the sample expects 3 and 2.\n\nSo perhaps the code is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the helper function's condition.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the helper function.\n\nThe helper function says:\n\nif a == 'R' and b == 'S' → a beats b → return 1.\n\nelif a == 'S' and b == 'P' → a beats b → return 1.\n\nelif a == 'P' and b == 'R' → a beats b → return 1.\n\nElse, check if b beats a → return -1.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, perhaps the condition is reversed.\n\nWait, for a='R' and b='S' → a beats b → correct.\n\nBut for a='S' and b='R' → S is beaten by R → so in the helper function, it's in the else clause, returns -1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the helper function seems correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the code is treating the rounds as 0-based, but the sample considers the rounds as 1-based.\n\nNo, because in the code, i ranges from 0 to 6 for n=7 rounds.\n\nSo, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way the indices are being calculated.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should have i % lenA and i % lenB, but perhaps lenA is not computed correctly.\n\nWait, in the sample, A is 'RPS', which is 3 letters, lenA=3.\n\nB is 'RSPP' → 4 letters, lenB=4.\n\nSo, for i=6:\n\ni=6%3=0 → a=R.\n\ni=6%4=2 → b=P.\n\nSo, R vs P → R beats P → res=1 → Poly gets a spot.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, in the code, N is 2, Poly is 3.\n\nBut sample expects N=3, Poly=2.\n\nSo, perhaps the code is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample's initial description is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample's output is reversed.\n\nWait, the sample output is '3 2'.\n\nSo, perhaps the code is counting Poly's and N's in reverse.\n\nWait, perhaps in the code, when res is 1, Poly gets a spot, but in reality, when a beats b, N's move wins, so P gets a spot.\n\nYes, so in the code, when res is 1, we add to Poly.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, why is the sample expecting N=3, Poly=2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the code's loop.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is processing i from 0 to n-1, but perhaps the mod is incorrect.\n\nWait, in the code, for each i, a is A[i % lenA], but perhaps it should be A[i % lenA] when i starts from 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut perhaps the code is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should process i from 1 to n.\n\nBut that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should take into account that the indices are 1-based, not 0-based.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct, and the sample's expected output is wrong.\n\nBut that's unlikely.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet me simulate the code step by step for the sample.\n\nSample input:\n\nn=7\n\nA = RPS → indexes 0:R, 1:P, 2:S.\n\nB = RSPP → indexes 0:R, 1:S, 2:P, 3:P.\n\nProcess each i from 0 to 6:\n\ni=0:\n\na = R, b = R → same → no.\n\ni=1:\n\na = P, b = S → S beats P → res = -1 → N +=1 → N=1.\n\ni=2:\n\na = S, b = P → S beats P → res=1 → Poly +=1 → Poly=1.\n\ni=3:\n\na = R, b = P → R beats P → res=1 → Poly +=1 → Poly=2.\n\ni=4:\n\na = P, b = R → R beats P → res =-1 → N +=1 → N=2.\n\ni=5:\n\na = S, b = S → same → no.\n\ni=6:\n\na = R, b = P → R beats P → res=1 → Poly +=1 → Poly=3.\n\nSo, N=2, Poly=3.\n\nSo, the code returns 2 3, but the sample expects 3 2.\n\nSo, the code is not matching the sample.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I've mixed up N and P.\n\nIn the code, when res is 1, Poly gets a spot.\n\nWhen res is -1, N gets a spot.\n\nBut perhaps it's the other way around.\n\nWait, perhaps when a beats b, the winner is a's player (N), so P gets a spot.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in the code, when res is 1, Poly gets a spot.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut in the sample, the code is adding to N's count when the outcome is a's move loses.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, why the sample's expected output is different.\n\nAh, perhaps I've misread the sample.\n\nLooking back, the sample's input is:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, perhaps the second line is A, the third line is B.\n\nSo, A is 'RPS', B is '",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they have played a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors.

If so, update the loser's red spot count.\n- **Count Red Spots**: Track the number of red spots for each player and print the result after processing all rounds.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the outcome of each round and accurately count the red spots, providing the correct result within the constraints.",
