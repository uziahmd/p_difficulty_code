In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles, and she needs to draw the minimum number of extra tiles to form at least one mentsu. A mentsu can be either a triplet (three same tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\nHmm, the input is three strings, each representing a tile. For each string, I think I need to compute the minimum number of tiles needed to complete a mentsu starting from that initial set.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the output is three numbers, right? Like for each of the three tiles, how many extra do I need if I'm trying to make a mentsu that includes that tile as part of it. Or maybe not. Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nIn the sample input, the output is ['0', '0', '1']. Let me see. The first tile is '1s 2s 3s' which already forms a shuntsu (since it's 1,2,3 in s). So for this, she needs 0 more tiles. The second is '9m 9m 9m' which is a koutsu, so 0. The third is '3p 9m 2p'. How does she get 1? Because she can add either 1p or 4p to make a sequence. So for each tile, we have to consider what's the minimal number of tiles needed to form any possible mentsu that includes at least that tile in her hand.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win.\" So overall, she can choose any mentsu she can form, regardless of which initial tiles are in it. But the output is three numbers, each corresponding to the required draws for each initial tile. Oh wait, no. Looking at the example, the output is three numbers. So perhaps for each of the three initial tiles, compute the minimal number of tiles needed to form a mentsu that includes that tile, and then take the minimal across all possible mentsu that could be formed by adding tiles.\n\nWait, no. Let me read the note again. In the third example, she can get a shuntsu by drawing one tile—1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will include 3p, 9m, 2p, 1p or 4p. So for the third tile, which is 2p, she needs one tile. So the output is 1 for that tile. But why isn't it 0? Because with just the three tiles, none of them form a mentsu. She has 3p, 9m, 2p. So no triplet or sequence.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the three initial tiles, determine the minimal number of tiles needed to add to the initial set such that the combined set contains at least one mentsu. Then, the output is these three numbers.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each of the three initial tiles, generate all possible ways to add 0,1,2,.. tiles to create a mentsu, and find the minimal count.\n\n2. Then, for each initial tile, compute the minimal number of tiles needed to add so that in the resulting set, there exists a mentsu. Then, output those three numbers.\n\nWait, but how do I model this? Because when you add tiles, the initial set plus the added ones should contain at least one mentsu.\n\nBut considering that for each initial tile, I can add any number of tiles (including zero), but the problem is to find the minimal number of tiles that, when added, allow her to form at least one mentsu in her entire hand.\n\nSo for each of the three initial tiles, I need to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that in the union of the initial and the added, there's a mentsu.\n\nBut since she can add any tiles, including duplicates, this might allow overlapping possibilities.\n\nWait, but for each initial set, which is the three tiles, I can add any number of tiles, possibly zero, to form a mentsu. So for each initial set, I can simulate adding some tiles and check if any mentsu exists.\n\nThe challenge is to find, for each initial set, the minimal number of tiles to add so that the total set (initial + added) has at least one mentsu.\n\nSo for each of the three initial sets, compute the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nWait, but the way the output is structured, each line corresponds to each of the three initial tiles. So for each tile in the initial set, what is the minimal number of tiles to add so that the entire set (including that tile) forms a mentsu.\n\nNo, that's not correct. Because the initial set has three tiles, and each of those tiles could be part of a mentsu when you add some tiles. So for each tile in the initial set, I think the question is: what is the minimal number of tiles to add so that this particular tile is part of a mentsu in the new set.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says, she needs to have at least one mentsu in her hand after adding. So it's possible that adding tiles allows her to form a mentsu that doesn't even include that initial tile.\n\nWait, but the output is three numbers, each corresponding to each of the initial tiles. So perhaps each number represents, for that specific initial tile, the minimal number of tiles to add so that the mentsu includes that tile.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's look at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nSample Output:\n['0', '0', '1']\n\nExplanation: For the third initial tile, which is 3p, 9m, 2p, she can add either 1p or 4p to form a shuntsu (like 1p, 2p, 3p or 2p,3p,4p). So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo the output is three numbers, each indicating the minimal number of tiles to add to form a mentsu that includes at least that initial tile. Or perhaps, for each initial tile, what is the minimal number of tiles needed to add so that the initial tile is part of some mentsu.\n\nWait, but for the first initial tile, which is 1s,2s,3s, she already has a shuntsu, so adding 0 tiles is sufficient. So the output is 0.\n\nSimilarly for the second initial tile, 9m 9m 9m: it's a koutsu, so 0.\n\nFor the third initial tile, 3p, she needs to add 1 tile.\n\nSo for each initial tile, I need to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that this tile is part of a mentsu in the new set.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each initial tile (each of the three), find the minimal number of tiles to add so that the new set (initial plus added) contains at least one mentsu, and this mentsu must include the initial tile.\n\nWait, no. Because maybe the mentsu can be formed without including the initial tile. But then, why is the output for the third initial tile 1? Because she can form a mentsu that includes the initial tile.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that the mentsu must include at least one of the initial tiles. No, the problem statement says she must have at least one mentsu in her hand. So the mentsu can be formed from any combination of tiles, including the added ones.\n\nWait, but the output is three numbers, each for each of the initial tiles. So perhaps each number represents the minimal number of tiles needed to add so that the initial tile is part of a mentsu in the new set.\n\nSo for each of the three initial tiles, compute the minimal number of tiles to add so that the initial tile is part of some mentsu in the new set.\n\nBut then, in the third case, adding 1 tile allows the formation of a mentsu that includes the initial tile.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each of the three initial tiles, consider that tile as part of a potential mentsu. Find the minimal number of additional tiles needed to form a mentsu that includes this tile.\n\nWait, but perhaps the minimal is achieved by forming a mentsu that doesn't include the initial tile. For example, suppose the initial set is [1m, 2m, 3m]. Then, the mentsu is already present, so 0 tiles are needed. But if the initial set was [1m, 2m, 4m], then adding 3m would form a shuntsu, which includes 2m and 4m but not 1m. So for the 1m tile, the minimal would be 3-1=2 tiles added (adding 2m and 3m?), but wait, that may not be necessary.\n\nWait, no. Let's think again. For each initial tile, the minimal number of tiles to add such that the new set (initial + added) contains a mentsu that includes the initial tile.\n\nWait, maybe that's the key point. So for the initial tile T, what is the minimal number of tiles to add so that there's a mentsu in the new set that includes T.\n\nSo for the third tile in the sample, 3p, 9m, 2p: to form a mentsu that includes 3p, you can add 1p, making a shuntsu 1p, 2p, 3p. So the mentsu includes 3p. So that's why the output is 1.\n\nIf she adds 4p instead, the mentsu would be 2p,3p,4p, which also includes 3p. So both options require adding 1 tile.\n\nSo for each initial tile, we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that the initial tile is part of a mentsu in the new set.\n\nTherefore, the approach is:\n\nFor each tile in the initial set:\n\n- Generate all possible mentsu that include this tile.\n\n- For each such mentsu, calculate how many tiles are missing from the initial set.\n\n- Take the minimal number of tiles to add to cover those missing tiles.\n\n- The minimal among all possible mentsu that include this tile is the answer for that tile.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps a mentsu can be formed without considering the initial tile. For example, if the initial set has three tiles, and adding two tiles allows a different mentsu, but this mentsu does not include any of the initial tiles. In that case, the initial tiles are not part of the mentsu. However, according to the output format, each number is for each initial tile, so perhaps the mentsu must include at least one of the initial tiles.\n\nWait, no. Because in the sample, the third initial tile's output is 1 because adding a tile allows a mentsu that includes that initial tile. If she had added a tile that doesn't include any of the initial tiles, but forms a mentsu elsewhere, then perhaps that's not counted for any of the initial tiles.\n\nWait, but the output is three numbers, each for each initial tile. So perhaps for each initial tile, the minimal number of tiles needed to add so that the new set contains at least one mentsu, regardless of whether that mentsu includes the initial tile.\n\nBut then, for the third initial tile, the minimal is 1 because she can form a mentsu that includes it. But maybe she could form a mentsu elsewhere without adding anything else. But that's not the case in the sample.\n\nWait, the initial set is 3p,9m,2p. Are there any existing mentsu?\n\nNo, because 3p,9m,2p don't form a triplet or a sequence.\n\nSo she needs to add tiles. The minimal is 1, as adding 1p or 4p allows a sequence.\n\nSo for each initial tile, the minimal number is determined by the minimal tiles needed to add so that in the entire set, a mentsu exists, which can include any of the initial tiles.\n\nWait, but the output is three numbers, each for each initial tile. So perhaps each number represents the minimal number of tiles needed to add, such that the initial tile is part of at least one mentsu in the new set.\n\nSo for the third initial tile, the minimal is 1. For the other two, it's zero because they are part of existing mentsus.\n\nSo yes, the plan is:\n\nFor each initial tile T, find the minimal number of tiles to add so that T is part of a mentsu in the new set.\n\nNow, how to model this?\n\nEach initial tile is part of a certain group (suit and number). To form a mentsu that includes T, it can be part of a triplet or a sequence.\n\nSo for each initial tile, we can:\n\n1. Check if adding zero tiles would allow T to be part of a triplet or sequence.\n\n   - For triplet: check if there are two more tiles equal to T. Adding two tiles would suffice, but perhaps less.\n\n   Wait, no. Because the initial set has three tiles, and we can only add tiles beyond that. So for a triplet, we need three Ts. So for example, initial set has one T, adding two more Ts would form a triplet.\n\n   So the required tiles to add are two.\n\n2. For a sequence: find the longest possible sequence that includes T, and see how many tiles are needed.\n\nSo for each initial tile, T, we need to consider all possible sequences that include T, and for each sequence, calculate how many tiles are missing in the current set.\n\nThen, for each such sequence, the minimal number of tiles to add is the number of tiles missing.\n\nWe then choose the minimal among all possible sequences and triplets that include T.\n\nSo the steps for each tile T are:\n\n- Enumerate all possible triplets that can include T.\n\n   For triplet: same number and suit.\n\n   So the triplet is [T, T, T]. So if the initial set has one T, we need to add two more Ts.\n\n- Enumerate all possible sequences that can include T.\n\n   For a sequence, the three tiles are consecutive numbers in the same suit. So for T = x, the sequence can be x-1, x, x+1, or x, x+1, x+2, or x-1, x, x+1.\n\n   Wait, no. A sequence is three consecutive numbers. So for T, the possible sequences that include T are:\n\n   - If T is the first number: T, T+1, T+2.\n\n   - If T is the middle: T-1, T, T+1.\n\n   - If T is the third: T-2, T-1, T.\n\n   So for each possible sequence that includes T, check how many of the required tiles are already present in the initial set. The number of tiles missing is (3 - count of present tiles). The minimal across all sequences is the candidate for minimal tiles needed.\n\nSo for each T, the minimal number of tiles to add is the minimum between:\n\n   a) the minimal tiles needed for a triplet (which is 2, since we have one T, need two more).\n\n   b) the minimal tiles needed for any of the three possible sequences that include T.\n\nSo for each T, compute a) and b), and take the minimal.\n\nBut wait, perhaps a sequence may require fewer tiles than a triplet. For example, if T is part of a sequence that requires only one tile to be added.\n\nSo for each T, the process is:\n\n1. For the triplet case: need 2 more Ts, so adding 2 tiles.\n\n2. For each of the three possible sequences that include T:\n\n   For each sequence S (which is a list of three tiles):\n\n   - Count how many of S's tiles are present in the initial set (excluding T itself, as T is the current tile being considered).\n\n   Wait, no. The initial set has three tiles, which may include other tiles besides T. So for the sequence S, we need to count how many of its tiles are in the initial set.\n\n   For example, initial set is [T, A, B], and S is [T-1, T, T+1]. We count how many of T-1, T, T+1 are present in the initial set.\n\n   So for S, the count is the number of elements in S that are present in the initial set.\n\n   Then, the number of tiles missing is 3 - count.\n\n   So for each S, the required tiles to add is max(0, 3 - count).\n\n   We take the minimal over all possible S.\n\nSo for each T, the minimal is min(2, min_sequence_required), where min_sequence_required is the minimal required across all sequences that include T.\n\nWait, but what if a sequence requires 0 tiles? That is, if the initial set already has all three tiles of some sequence S that includes T.\n\nIn that case, the required tiles to add is 0.\n\nSo, for each T, the minimal number of tiles to add is the minimum between 2 (for triplet) and the minimal required for any of the three possible sequences.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nFor each tile T in the initial set:\n\n   Initialize min_add = 2 (triplet case)\n\n   For each possible sequence S that includes T:\n\n       count = number of tiles in S that are present in the initial set.\n\n       required = 3 - count\n\n       if required < min_add:\n\n           min_add = required\n\n   Also, check for triplet: required is 3 - current count (initial set has 1 T, so 3-1=2)\n\n   So min_add is the minimal between the triplet and the best sequence.\n\nThus, the minimal number of tiles to add for T is min_add.\n\nOnce this is computed for each T, output the three values.\n\nNow, the task is to implement this.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead the three initial tiles.\n\nFor each tile T in the three:\n\n   suit = T[1]\n\n   number = int(T[0])\n\n   Create a set containing all initial tiles.\n\n   For the triplet case: required is 3-1=2.\n\n   For the sequences:\n\n       Generate the three possible sequences that include T.\n\n       For each sequence S:\n\n           count = 0\n\n           for tile in S:\n\n               if tile is present in the initial set:\n\n                   count +=1\n\n           required = 3 - count\n\n           if required < current_min:\n\n               update current_min.\n\n   Compare the triplet required (2) with the best sequence required.\n\n   The minimal is the answer for T.\n\nSo now, the code structure.\n\nFirst, read the input. It's three strings, each is a tile.\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\nSo tiles is a list of three strings.\n\nFor each tile in tiles:\n\n   process as above.\n\nBut wait, no. Because each initial tile is part of the set. So the initial set is the union of all three tiles. So for each T in the initial set, when processing, the initial set is the original three.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial set is the three tiles given. So for each T in the initial set, the initial set is fixed as the three given tiles. So for each T, the initial set is the same.\n\nWait, no. For example, if the initial set is ['1m', '1m', '1m'], then for each T (all are '1m'), the initial set is the same.\n\nSo the initial set is the same for all three tiles.\n\nThus, for each tile T in the initial set, when evaluating, the initial set is the three given tiles.\n\nThus, the code can process as follows.\n\nRead the three tiles into a list called initial_tiles.\n\nFor each T in initial_tiles:\n\n   suit = T[1]\n\n   num = int(T[0])\n\n   # Now, for the triplet case:\n\n   # Triplet requires three Ts.\n\n   # Initial set has one T, so need two more.\n\n   triplet_required = 2\n\n   # Now, for sequences:\n\n   # Generate all three possible sequences that include T.\n\n   sequences = []\n\n   # Case 1: T is the first in the sequence.\n\n   seq1 = [(num-1, suit), (num, suit), (num+1, suit)]\n\n   sequences.append(seq1)\n\n   # Case 2: T is the middle.\n\n   seq2 = [(num-1, suit), (num, suit), (num+1, suit)]\n\n   # Wait, that's same as seq1. No, wait, no. Wait, T is the middle, so the sequence is T-1, T, T+1.\n\n   # So the same as seq1.\n\n   # Hmm, no. Because the triplet is about three same tiles, and the sequence is about three consecutive in the same suit.\n\n   # So for T being the middle, the sequence is T-1, T, T+1.\n\n   # So the sequences are:\n\n   # T-2, T-1, T → sequence where T is last.\n\n   # T-1, T, T+1 → T is middle.\n\n   # T, T+1, T+2 → T is first.\n\n   # So sequences are:\n\n   seq_end = [(num, suit), (num+1, suit), (num+2, suit)]  # T is first.\n\n   seq_mid = [(num-1, suit), (num, suit), (num+1, suit)]  # T is middle.\n\n   seq_start = [(num-2, suit), (num-1, suit), (num, suit)]  # T is last.\n\n   sequences = [seq_end, seq_mid, seq_start]\n\n   # Now, for each sequence in sequences, count how many are present in the initial set.\n\n   min_seq_required = 3  # maximum possible.\n\n   for seq in sequences:\n\n       count = 0\n\n       for tile in seq:\n\n           # tile is a tuple (number, suit)\n\n           # check if this tile is present in the initial set.\n\n           # The initial set is a set of the three initial tiles.\n\n           # So we can precompute the initial_set.\n\n           # So first, create the initial_set as a set of tuples.\n\n           initial_set = set()\n\n           for t in initial_tiles:\n\n               initial_set.add( (int(t[0]), t[1]) )\n\n           # Now, for each tile in the sequence, check if it's in initial_set.\n\n           for tile in seq:\n\n               if tile in initial_set:\n\n                   count +=1\n\n       required = 3 - count\n\n       if required < min_seq_required:\n\n           min_seq_required = required\n\n   # Now, compare the triplet_required (2) and min_seq_required.\n\n   # The minimal is the answer.\n\n   min_add = min( triplet_required, min_seq_required )\n\n   print(min_add)\n\nWait, but this would miss cases where adding multiple tiles for a sequence may allow a lower count than the triplet. For example, if a sequence can be formed with adding just 1 tile.\n\nSo the code correctly finds the minimal between the triplet case and the best sequence case.\n\nBut wait, for the triplet case, the required is 2, but perhaps a sequence can be formed with 1 tile added, which is better.\n\nYes, so the code correctly takes the minimum.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nInitial tiles as tuples:\n\ntile1: (1, 's')\n\ntile2: (2, 's')\n\ntile3: (3, 's')\n\ntile4: (9, 'm')\n\ntile5: (9, 'm')\n\ntile6: (9, 'm')\n\ntile7: (3, 'p')\n\ntile8: (9, 'm')\n\ntile9: (2, 'p')\n\nFor the third tile, 3p.\n\nProcessing T=(3,'p').\n\nTriplet required: 2.\n\nSequences:\n\nCase 1: 3p is first. So seq is (1p, 2p, 3p). Initial set has 3p, 2p, 9m, 9m, 9m. So in the initial set, 3p and 2p are present. So count is 2. required is 1.\n\nCase 2: 3p is middle. seq is 2p,3p,4p. Initial set has 2p,3p. So count is 2. required is 1.\n\nCase3: 3p is last. seq is 1p,2p,3p. same as case1, required is 1.\n\nSo the min_seq_required is 1.\n\nSo min_add is min(2,1)=1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: the second initial tile is 9m,9m,9m.\n\nProcessing T=9m.\n\nTriplet required: 0.\n\nBecause initial set has three 9m.\n\nSo min_add is 0.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nAnother example: initial set is 1m,4m,7m.\n\nWhat's the minimal for each tile.\n\nFor T=1m:\n\nTriplet: 2.\n\nSequence: possible sequences are:\n\n1,2,3 → need 2m and 3m.\n\nCount is 1 (only 1m is present). required 2.\n\nAnother sequence: 1,4,7 is not consecutive, so no.\n\nWait, no, sequences are only consecutive numbers. So for T=1m, the sequences are 1m,2m,3m or 0m (invalid) or 1m,2m,3m.\n\nSo required is 2.\n\nSo the triplet is better, requiring 2.\n\nBut perhaps a triplet can be formed by adding two 1m tiles. So min_add is 2.\n\nWait, but perhaps another sequence like 1m,2m,3m requires adding two tiles.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nAnother example: initial set is 1m,2m,4m.\n\nProcessing T=1m:\n\nTriplet: 2.\n\nSequences:\n\nCase1: 1,2,3 → initial has 1,2 → count 2 → required 1.\n\nCase2: 0,1,2 → invalid, as 0 is not allowed.\n\nCase3: 1,2,3 → same as case1.\n\nSo min_seq_required is 1.\n\nSo for T=1m, min_add is min(2,1) → 1.\n\nSo she needs to add 3m.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, to code this.\n\nImplementing in Python:\n\nRead the three tiles as a list.\n\nCreate the initial_set as a set of tuples.\n\nFor each tile in the initial set:\n\n   suit = tile[1]\n\n   num = tile[0]\n\n   triplet_required = 2\n\n   sequences = []\n\n   # Generate the three possible sequences.\n\n   # Case1: T is first.\n\n   seq1 = [(num-1, suit), (num, suit), (num+1, suit)]\n\n   # Case2: T is middle.\n\n   # Wait, no, the three sequences are:\n\n   # 1. T is the first in the sequence: T, T+1, T+2.\n\n   # 2. T is the middle: T-1, T, T+1.\n\n   # 3. T is the last: T-2, T-1, T.\n\n   # So the sequences are:\n\n   seq1 = [ (num, suit), (num+1, suit), (num+2, suit) ]\n\n   seq2 = [ (num-1, suit), (num, suit), (num+1, suit) ]\n\n   seq3 = [ (num-2, suit), (num-1, suit), (num, suit) ]\n\n   sequences = [seq1, seq2, seq3]\n\n   min_seq_required = 3  # initialize to max possible.\n\n   for seq in sequences:\n\n       count = 0\n\n       for t in seq:\n\n           if t in initial_set:\n\n               count +=1\n\n       required = 3 - count\n\n       if required < min_seq_required:\n\n           min_seq_required = required\n\n   # Now, find the minimal between triplet_required and min_seq_required.\n\n   min_add = min(triplet_required, min_seq_required)\n\n   print(min_add)\n\nWait, but the triplet case is always 2, right? Because initial set has one T, so adding two more.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when the initial set has multiple Ts?\n\nFor example, initial set is [T, T, T], triplet required is 0.\n\nBecause initial set has three Ts.\n\nAh! Right, I forgot that the initial set may have more than one T. So for a tile T, the initial count in the initial set may be more than one.\n\nSo, in the code, when processing T, the count for the triplet is 3 minus the number of Ts in the initial set.\n\nWait, because the triplet is three Ts.\n\nSo for T, the number of Ts in the initial set is the count.\n\nThus, for triplet_required, it's 3 - count.\n\nSo in code:\n\ncount_triplet = initial_set.count( (num, suit) )\n\ntriplet_required = 3 - count_triplet\n\nSimilarly, for the sequences, the code counts how many of their tiles are present in the initial set.\n\nSo the code should be adjusted.\n\nSo the revised code:\n\nRead the three initial tiles into a list.\n\ninitial_set = set()\n\nfor t in tiles:\n\n    initial_set.add( (int(t[0]), t[1]) )\n\nfor each tile in tiles:\n\n    num = int(tile[0])\n\n    suit = tile[1]\n\n    # Triplet case:\n\n    count_triplet = initial_set.count( (num, suit) )\n\n    triplet_required = 3 - count_triplet\n\n    # Sequences:\n\n    sequences = [ \n\n        [ (num, suit), (num+1, suit), (num+2, suit) ], \n\n        [ (num-1, suit), (num, suit), (num+1, suit) ], \n\n        [ (num-2, suit), (num-1, suit), (num, suit) ]\n\n    ]\n\n    min_seq_required = 3  # worst case\n\n    for seq in sequences:\n\n        count = 0\n\n        for t in seq:\n\n            if t in initial_set:\n\n                count += 1\n\n        required = 3 - count\n\n        if required < min_seq_required:\n\n            min_seq_required = required\n\n    # Compute min_add\n\n    min_add = min(triplet_required, min_seq_required)\n\n    print(min_add)\n\nThis should handle cases where the initial set has multiple Ts.\n\nTesting this with the second sample input:\n\nInput: ['9m 9m 9m']\n\nFor each T (all are 9m):\n\ncount_triplet = 3 → triplet_required=0.\n\nSo min_add is 0.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInitial set: ['1m 1m 2m'].\n\nFor T=1m:\n\ncount_triplet = 2 → triplet_required=1.\n\nsequences:\n\ncase1: 1,2,3 → initial has 1,2 → count=2 → required=1.\n\ncase2: 0,1,2 → invalid.\n\ncase3: -1, 0, 1 → invalid.\n\nso min_seq_required is 1.\n\nso min_add is min(1,1) → 1.\n\nBut wait, adding 1m and 3m would allow a triplet, which requires 1 tile.\n\nAlternatively, adding 3m allows a sequence.\n\nSo the code correctly gives 1.\n\nAnother case: initial set is ['1m', '2m', '3m'].\n\nFor T=1m:\n\ncount_triplet=1 → required=2.\n\nsequences:\n\ncase1: 1,2,3 → all present → required=0.\n\nso min_add is 0.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the initial_set is built from all three initial tiles, not just the current T.\n\nSo when processing T, the initial set is fixed, regardless of which T is being processed.\n\nYes, because all three are part of the initial set.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nRead the input as three strings.\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\ninitial_set = set()\n\nfor t in tiles:\n\n    num = int(t[0])\n\n    suit = t[1]\n\n    initial_set.add( (num, suit) )\n\nThen, for each tile in tiles:\n\nprocess as above.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\ninitial_set = set()\n\nfor t in tiles:\n\n    initial_set.add( (int(t[0]), t[1]) )\n\nfor tile in tiles:\n\n    num = int(tile[0])\n\n    suit = tile[1]\n\n    # Triplet case\n\n    count_triplet = initial_set.count( (num, suit) )\n\n    triplet_required = 3 - count_triplet\n\n    # Sequence cases\n\n    sequences = [\n\n        [ (num, suit), (num+1, suit), (num+2, suit) ],\n\n        [ (num-1, suit), (num, suit), (num+1, suit) ],\n\n        [ (num-2, suit), (num-1, suit), (num, suit) ]\n\n    ]\n\n    min_seq_required = 3  # Start with the worst case\n\n    for seq in sequences:\n\n        count = 0\n\n        for t in seq:\n\n            if t in initial_set:\n\n                count += 1\n\n        required = 3 - count\n\n        if required < min_seq_required:\n\n            min_seq_required = required\n\n    # Determine the minimal number of tiles to add\n\n    min_add = min(triplet_required, min_seq_required)\n\n    print(min_add)\n\nWait, but what about when a sequence has negative numbers? Like in the third sequence for T=1m.\n\nFor example, when T is 1m, the third sequence is (-1m, 0m, 1m). These are invalid, but the code will still process them.\n\nBut since the initial_set doesn't have these tiles, their count will be zero, and required will be 3.\n\nSo the code doesn't need to handle invalid numbers because the initial set won't have those.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nFor the third tile '3p':\n\ncount_triplet is 1 → required 2.\n\nsequences:\n\nseq1: 3p,4p,5p → initial has 3p → count=1 → required 2.\n\nseq2: 2p,3p,4p → initial has 3p and 2p → count=2 → required 1.\n\nseq3: 1p,2p,3p → initial has 2p and 3p → count=2 → required 1.\n\nmin_seq_required is 1.\n\nso min_add is min(2, 1) → 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code should pass all test cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) in her hand.
