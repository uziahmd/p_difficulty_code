Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a regular convex n-gon, and I need to find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The output should be these three vertices in order. If there are multiple optimal solutions, any is acceptable.\n\nHmm. So the first thing I need to figure out is how to compute the possible angles that can be formed by selecting three vertices in this way, and then find which one is closest to 'a'.\n\nLet's think about the regular polygon. Each internal angle of a regular n-gon is known. For a regular polygon with n sides, each internal angle is (n-2)*180/n degrees. But wait, that's the internal angle. However, when we form an angle using two adjacent edges, like from v1 to v2 to v3, what's the measure of that angle?\n\nWait, no. Because in a regular polygon, each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. So the central angle between consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees. So when you pick three consecutive vertices, say 1, 2, 3, the angle at vertex 2 is determined by the arcs between 1-2 and 2-3.\n\nWait, more accurately, the angle at vertex v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to it. Or wait, maybe not. Because in a circle, the inscribed angle theorem says that an angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice the inscribed angle. So if I have points A, B, C on a circle, the angle at B is equal to half the measure of the arc AC.\n\nBut in our case, for a regular polygon, the points are placed on a circle. So for three consecutive vertices, like v1 = k, v2 = k+1, v3 = k+2, the angle at v2 is the angle formed by the lines from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3.\n\nWait, but in a regular polygon, the sides are chords of the circle. So the angle at v2 would depend on the number of steps between v1 and v3 around the polygon. For example, if v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2, like in a triangle, then the angle is 60 degrees. But for a square, if v1 is two steps away from v3 around the polygon, then the angle is 90 degrees.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to model this.\n\nEach vertex of the polygon is on a circle, equally spaced. So the distance between two consecutive vertices along the circumference is 360/n degrees. So for any two vertices, the number of steps between them along the shorter arc is some k, where 0 < k < n/2.\n\nWhen choosing three vertices v1, v2, v3, arranged in order around the circle, the angle at v2 is determined by the arcs between v1-v2 and v2-v3. But wait, that's not exactly right because the angle is formed by two chords: v1v2 and v2v3. The measure of that angle depends on the arcs opposite to it.\n\nWait, according to the circle theorems, the angle formed by two chords intersecting at a point on the circumference is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Or wait, no. Wait, the inscribed angle theorem says that an angle formed by two chords in a circle (with vertex on the circumference) is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I got that wrong. Let me think again. Suppose I have a point B on a circle, and two other points A and C. The angle ABC is an inscribed angle. According to the theorem, the measure of angle ABC is equal to half the measure of the arc AC that does not contain B.\n\nWait, that's correct. So the angle at B is half the measure of the arc from A to C that's opposite to B.\n\nSo in our case, for three consecutive vertices v1, v2, v3, the angle at v2 is determined by the arc from v1 to v3 that doesn't contain v2. Since the polygon is regular, the arc length is fixed based on how many steps apart v1 and v3 are.\n\nSo for a regular n-gon, the central angle between two consecutive vertices is theta = 360 / n degrees. So between v1 and v3, the arc that doesn't include v2 is k * theta, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3. For three consecutive points, k is 2, so the arc is 2*theta. Then the angle at v2 is half of that, so theta.\n\nWait, wait",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of these vertices is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and how angles are formed by their vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Polygon and Angles**: A regular polygon has all its sides equal and all its internal angles equal. Each vertex of the polygon lies on a circle, equally spaced around the circumference. The central angle between two consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees.\n2. **Inscribed Angle Theorem**: The angle at a vertex (v2) formed by two other vertices (v1 and v3) is an inscribed angle. This angle is half the measure of the arc opposite to it. For three consecutive vertices v1, v2, v3, the angle at v2 is determined by the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2.\n3. **Finding Closest Angle**: We need to find the set of three vertices such that the angle at v2 is closest to 'a'. This involves checking all possible sets of three vertices and calculating the corresponding angles, then selecting the one with the smallest absolute difference from 'a'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\n\ndef compute_angle(k):\n    return abs( (k * 180 - 90) % 180 - a )\n\nmin_diff = float('inf')\nbest_vertices = []\n\nfor start in range(n):\n    for step in range(1, (n // 2) + 1):\n        end = (start + step) % n\n        angle = (step * 360 / n) / 2  # Angle at the middle vertex\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_vertices = [start+1, start+step+1, end+1]\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            # To ensure we have a valid triplet, but any is acceptable\n            pass\n\n# If no better triplet found, check all possibilities\nif min_diff == float('inf'):\n    for v2 in range(n):\n        for k in range(1, n):\n            v1 = (v2 - k) % n\n            v3 = (v2 + k) % n\n            if v1 != v2 and v3 != v2 and v1 != v3:\n                angle = (k * 360 / n) / 2\n                diff = abs(angle - a)\n                if diff < min_diff or (diff == min_diff and not best_vertices):\n                    min_diff = diff\n                    best_vertices = [v1+1, v2+1, v3+1]\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, best_vertices)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe code first calculates the angle for each possible triplet of vertices by considering the arc lengths between them. It iterates through each vertex as the middle vertex (v2) and each possible step size (k) to determine the angle at v2. The angle is computed as half the measure of the arc opposite to v2, which gives the inscribed angle. The code keeps track of the closest angle found and updates the best triplet of vertices accordingly. If no valid triplet is found initially, it performs a more exhaustive search to ensure all possibilities are considered, ensuring the optimal solution is found.",
