Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a regular convex n-gon, and I need to find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The output should be these three vertices in order. If there are multiple optimal solutions, any is acceptable.\n\nHmm. So the first thing I need to figure out is how to compute the possible angles that can be formed by selecting three vertices in this polygon, and then find which one is closest to 'a'.\n\nWait, but for a regular polygon, all sides and angles are equal. So maybe there's a pattern or formula for the possible angles between points.\n\nLet me think about the structure of a regular n-gon. Each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. So the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees.\n\nWhen we choose three vertices, v1, v2, v3, they form an angle at v2. How is this angle determined?\n\nI remember that in a circle, the measure of an angle formed by two chords (like from v1 to v2 and v2 to v3) depends on the arcs they subtend. Specifically, the angle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in circle geometry, the angle formed by two chords at a point on the circumference is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me recall.\n\nOh right, if you have two points on a circle, say A and B, and another point C on the circumference not on the same chord, then the angle at C (angle ACB) is equal to half the measure of the arc AB that doesn't contain C. Wait, no, maybe it's the sum of the opposite arcs. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me get this straight. For a triangle inscribed in a circle, the angle at a vertex is equal to half the measure of the opposite arc. So, in this case, the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3, but not passing through v2.\n\nSo, for a regular n-gon, each side corresponds to a central angle of 360/n degrees. So the arc length between any two consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees.\n\nSo when we pick three vertices v1, v2, v3, the arc from v1 to v3 that does not pass through v2 is some multiple of 360/n degrees. The angle at v2 is half of that.\n\nWait, for example, in a regular triangle (n=3), each central angle is 120 degrees. Suppose v2 is vertex 2, and v1 is 1, v3 is 3. Then the arc from 1 to 3 is 120 degrees, but since the polygon is a triangle, the arc not containing v2 is 120 degrees. So the angle at v2 is 60 degrees, which is correct because in an equilateral triangle, each angle is 60 degrees.\n\nAnother example: square (n=4). Let's say v2 is vertex 2. Let's choose v1 as 1 and v3 as 3. The arc from 1 to 3 is 180 degrees (since in a square, 1 and 3 are opposite). So the angle at v2 is 90 degrees. But wait, that's the case when v1 and v3 are two steps apart. Alternatively, if v1 is 1 and v3 is 4, what's the angle?\n\nWait, the arc from 1 to 4 in a square is 90 degrees (because each step is 90 degrees). Wait, no. Wait, the square has vertices 1, 2, 3, 4 arranged clockwise. So the central angle between 1 and 2 is 90 degrees. The arc from 1 to 4 is 270 degrees? Or is it the shorter arc? No, the shorter arc is 90 degrees. Wait, no, the arc from 1 to 4 is 270 degrees if you go the long way, but the shorter arc is 90 degrees. Because the total is 360, so 360 - 270 = 90.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle is determined by the smaller arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't include v2.\n\nSo, for the square example, if v2 is 2, and v1 is 1 and v3 is 4:\n\nThe arc from 1 to 4 not passing through 2 is 90 degrees. So the angle is 45 degrees.\n\nWhich is correct, as in the sample where a is 67, choosing the 45-degree angle is better.\n\nSo, the angle at v2 is (arc_length / 2), where",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of these vertices is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and how angles are formed by selecting vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Polygon Structure**: A regular convex n-gon has all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each vertex is equally spaced around a circle, meaning the central angle between any two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees.\n\n2. **Angle Formation**: For any three vertices v1, v2, v3 in the polygon, the angle at v2 can be determined using the arc length between v1 and v3. The angle at v2 is half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not pass through v2.\n\n3. **Finding the Optimal Angle**: We need to check all possible triplets of vertices to find the one that forms an angle closest to 'a'. Given the constraints, checking each triplet directly would be inefficient, so we use a mathematical approach to determine the optimal vertices based on the central angles.\n\n4. **Mathematical Calculation**: For each vertex v2, we consider the arcs spanning k steps away from v2, where k ranges from 1 to (n-1)/2 (to avoid duplicates). The corresponding angle at v2 is calculated and compared to 'a' to find the closest match.\n\n5. **Efficient Search**: By iterating through each possible vertex as the middle vertex v2 and considering the arcs around it, we efficiently determine the optimal triplet without exhaustive checking.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\nbest_diff = float('inf')\nbest_v = []\n\nfor v2 in range(1, n+1):\n    for step in range(1, (n//2)+1):\n        v1 = (v2 - step) % n\n        v3 = (v2 + step) % n\n        if v1 == v3:\n            continue\n        arc = step * (360 // n)\n        angle = arc // 2\n        current_diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if current_diff < best_diff or (current_diff == best_diff and angle > best_angle):\n            best_diff = current_diff\n            best_v = [v1+1, v2, v3+1]\n            best_angle = angle\n        elif current_diff == best_diff and angle > best_angle:\n            best_v = [v1+1, v2, v3+1]\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, best_v)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, n (number of vertices) and a (target angle).\n\n2. **Iterating Over Middle Vertices**: For each vertex v2, we consider arcs of varying lengths (steps) around it.\n\n3. **Calculating Angles**: For each step size, we compute the corresponding angle at v2 and compare it to 'a'.\n\n4. **Tracking the Best Match**: We keep track of the closest angle found and update our result accordingly.\n\n5. **Output**: Finally, we print the indices of the vertices that form the angle closest to 'a'.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal triplet of vertices without unnecessary computations, making it suitable for large values of n up to 105.",
