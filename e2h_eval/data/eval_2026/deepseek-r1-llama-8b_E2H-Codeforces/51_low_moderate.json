Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to check if the pile of letters can exactly form the two names given. Hmm, right.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again. Oh right, the input consists of three lines: guest's name, host's name, and the pile. We need to determine if the pile is a perfect combination of both names without any extra or missing letters.\n\nSo the approach here is probably to count the frequency of each character in all three inputs and see if they match.\n\nWait, wait. So for example, the guest and host together should have exactly the same letters as the pile, and no more, no less.\n\nSo maybe the steps are:\n\n1. Combine the guest and host strings into one.\n2. Count the frequency of each character in this combined string.\n3. Do the same for the pile string.\n4. Compare the two frequency dictionaries. If they are equal, output YES; else, NO.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nBut how to implement this in Python?\n\nHmm, I can use the collections.Counter class for this. It counts the occurrences of each character.\n\nSo, first, I'll read the three lines. Let's say:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, combine guest and host into one string.\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nCreate a counter for combined and for pile.\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ncount_combined = Counter(combined)\ncount_pile = Counter(pile)\n\nThen compare the two counters. If they are equal, print YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but what about the order? Because Counter compares the counts, not the keys. So if one has a letter that the other doesn't, it will return False.\n\nExactly, that's what we want.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRead the three lines.\n\nCheck if the combined guest+host's counter equals pile's counter.\n\nIf yes, print 'YES', else 'NO'.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nLike when one name is empty? Well, according to the problem statement, all lines are not empty. So we don't need to handle that.\n\nAnother case: when the pile is longer than the combined length. Then the counters would automatically differ, so correctly returns 'NO'.\n\nWhat about when the pile has the exact same letters but different cases? But the problem says all letters are uppercase, so no issue.\n\nAnother thing: the order of the letters doesn't matter because we're just counting frequencies.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS\nHost: DEDMOROZ\nPile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined guest and host: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\n\nCount the letters. Then compare to the pile.\n\nIn the sample, the combined is 15 letters (SANTA...), and the pile is also 15 letters. The counts should match.\n\nSample Output is 'YES'.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nGuest: PAPAINOEL\nHost: JOULUPUKKI\nPile: BABBONATALE FATHERCHRISTMAS BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nWait, no, in the problem statement, the second sample's pile is \"BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\". Wait, but when you combine them, perhaps the count differs.\n\nLooking at the note: the second sample is missing a 'P' and has an extra 'L'. So the code should catch that.\n\nSo our approach correctly handles this.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nNow, in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the three lines, stripping any newlines.\n\nWait, but when reading via input(), does it include the newline characters? Probably not, because input() reads until the newline and strips it.\n\nWait, no, input() returns the line without the trailing newline. So when using .strip(), it removes leading and trailing whitespace, including any newlines.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nYes.\n\nThen combine guest and host.\n\nThen create counters.\n\nCompare.\n\nPrint YES or NO.\n\nSo the code should look like this:\n\nRead the three lines, combine guest and host, make counters, compare.\n\nLet me write the code.\n\nSo:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Read the three lines\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\n# Combine guest and host\ncombined = guest + host\n\n# Check if the combined letters match the pile\nif Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nThat's the code.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample: the combined length is len(\"SANTACLAUS\") + len(\"DEDMOROZ\"). Let's see",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the pile of letters found at the door can be used to exactly reconstruct both the guest's name and the host's name without any extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to check if the given pile of letters can be rearranged to form both the guest's name and the host's name. This means that the combined letters of the guest and host should exactly match the letters in the pile.\n2. **Intuition**: By combining the guest's and host's names into a single string, we can count the frequency of each letter. Similarly, we count the frequency of each letter in the pile. If these two sets of letter counts are identical, it means the pile can be rearranged to form both names.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use the `Counter` class from the `collections` module in Python to count the frequency of each letter. This allows us to efficiently compare the letter counts of the combined guest and host names with those of the pile.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the combined guest and host names plus the length of the pile. This is efficient enough for the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads three lines of input corresponding to the guest's name, host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's and host's names are concatenated into a single string.\n3. **Counting Letters**: Using the `Counter` class, we count the frequency of each letter in the combined string and the pile string.\n4. **Comparison**: The counts of letters in the combined string are compared with those in the pile. If they match, \"YES\" is printed; otherwise, \"NO\" is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and accurately determine if the pile can be used to form both names without any discrepancies.",
