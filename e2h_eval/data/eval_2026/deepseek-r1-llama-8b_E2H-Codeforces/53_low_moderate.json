Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem correctly. The task is to find the maximum possible length of a substring that occurs two or more times in the input string. The occurrences can overlap. For example, in the sample input 'ababa', the substring 'aba' appears twice, overlapping each other. So the output is 3.\n\nLet me consider some examples. If the input is 'abcd', all substrings are unique, so the answer is 0. For 'zzz', the substrings 'zz' and 'zz' appear (overlapping), so the answer is 2.\n\nSo the goal is to find the maximum length L such that there exists a substring of length L that occurs at least twice in the string.\n\nHow do I approach this? One way is to check for all possible substring lengths starting from the largest possible down to 1, and see if any of them repeat.\n\nWait, but how to efficiently check for each possible length. Let's break it down.\n\nThe steps could be:\n\n1. Iterate over possible substring lengths L, starting from the maximum possible (which is len(s)-1) down to 1.\n2. For each L, collect all substrings of length L in the string.\n3. Check if any of these substrings appears more than once.\n4. The first L for which this is true is our answer.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because once we find the largest L where this condition holds, we can return it immediately.\n\nBut wait, for each L, how do I check if any substring appears at least twice?\n\nOne approach is to use a set to track seen substrings. For each substring of length L, add it to the set. If a duplicate is found (i.e., the substring is already in the set), then we know that L is a candidate, and since we're checking from largest to smallest, the first such L is our answer.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be something like this:\n\n- For L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n   - Create a set to store substrings of length L.\n   - Iterate through the string, taking each substring of length L.\n   - For each substring:\n      - If it's already in the set, return L as the answer.\n      - Otherwise, add it to the set.\n   - If after processing all substrings of length L, no duplicates are found, continue to smaller L.\n\nIf after checking all possible L (down to 1), none satisfy, return 0.\n\nWait, but what about when the entire string is considered? Like, for the string 'aaaaa', the entire string is a substring that appears once, but shorter ones may appear multiple times. But according to the problem statement, we need at least two occurrences. So, for 'aaaaa', the maximum L is 4, because 'aaaa' appears at positions 0 and 1.\n\nHmm, let me test this approach with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abcd'\nFor L=3: substrings are 'abc', 'bcd'. No duplicates.\nL=2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'—no duplicates.\nL=1: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'—all unique. So output 0.\n\nSample Input 2: 'ababa'\nL=4: substrings are 'abab', 'baba' — no duplicates.\nL=3: 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. When processing the third substring 'aba', it's already in the set. So L=3 is the answer.\n\nSample Input 3: 'zzz'\nL=2: 'zz' and 'zz' — duplicates. So L=2 is the answer.\n\nSo the approach works for these samples.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nThe steps in code would be:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nLoop L from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\n   create a set.\n\n   loop i from 0 to len(s)-L:\n\n       substring = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substring in set: return L\n\n       else: add to set.\n\nSo, for each L, we process all possible substrings of that length.\n\nOnce any substring is found in the set during the iteration, we return L.\n\nIf no L satisfies, return 0.\n\nWait, but in the case where len(s) is 1, the loop won't run, but the problem says the string is non-empty, so for len(s)=1, the output is 0.\n\nWhat about when the string is empty? According to the problem statement, the input string is non-empty, so we don't need to handle that case.\n\nAnother edge case: string of length 2, like 'aa'",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves checking each possible substring length starting from the largest possible down to 1. For each length, we collect all substrings of that length and check if any of them appears more than once. The first length for which this condition is met is our answer.\n\n1. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: Start from the maximum possible substring length (which is the length of the string minus one) and decrease down to 1.\n2. **Check Substrings**: For each length, generate all possible substrings of that length and use a set to track seen substrings. If a duplicate is found, return the current length as the result.\n3. **Return Result**: If no duplicates are found for any length, return 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest repeating substring by leveraging a set for quick look-up and avoiding unnecessary checks for smaller lengths once a solution is found.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nmax_length = len(s) - 1\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(max_length, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input string is read and its length is determined.\n- **Loop Through Lengths**: Starting from the longest possible substring length, we iterate down to 1.\n- **Generate Substrings**: For each length, generate all substrings of that length.\n- **Track Substrings**: Use a set to keep track of seen substrings. If a substring is found in the set, it means it has appeared before, so the current length is printed and the program exits.\n- **Handle Edge Cases**: If no repeating substrings are found for any length, the program prints 0.\n\nThis method ensures that we efficiently find the longest repeating substring with minimal computational overhead, making it suitable for strings up to the given constraint of 100 characters.",
