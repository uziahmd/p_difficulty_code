Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Vasily wants to maximize the number of hours his candles can burn. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each candle burns for one hour and then goes out. But when you have b burned candles, you can make one new candle. So it's a matter of reusing the stubs as much as possible.\n\nLet's take the example given: input 4 2. So initially, there are 4 candles. Each burns for 1 hour, so that's 4 hours. Then, from those 4 stubs, he can make 2 new candles (since 4 / 2 = 2). Those two burn for another 2 hours. Now, after burning, he has 2 stubs again. He can make another candle (2/2=1), which gives 1 more hour. The stubs from that is 1, but since 1 is less than b=2, he can't make more. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 hours.\n\nSo the process is: start with 'a' candles. Each time, we collect the stubs, convert them into new candles, and repeat until we can't make any more.\n\nHow do I model this in code?\n\nHmm, I think a loop would work. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Initialize the total hours to 'a'.\n2. While the number of stubs is enough to make at least one new candle:\n   a. Calculate how many new candles can be made: current_stubs // b.\n   b. Add that number to the total hours.\n   c. Update the stubs: new_candles = current_stubs // b. The remaining stubs after making new candles are current_stubs % b + new_candles (because each new candle gives a stub after burning).\n3. Return the total hours.\n\nWait, let me see. For each iteration, the steps are:\n\n- You have some stubs.\n- Make as many new candles as possible.\n- Each new candle adds 1 hour.\n- The stubs after making new candles are the leftovers plus the new candles' stubs.\n\nSo let's formalize it:\n\ntotal = a\ncurrent_stubs = a\n\nwhile current_stubs >= b:\n    new_candles = current_stubs // b\n    total += new_candles\n    current_stubs = (current_stubs % b) + new_candles\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nLet me test this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample: a=4, b=2.\n\nInitial total=4, current_stubs=4.\n\nLoop: 4 >=2 → new_candles=2, total becomes 6. current_stubs is (4%2=0) +2=2.\n\nNext loop: 2>=2 → new=1, total 7. current_stubs =0+1=1. Now 1<2, loop stops. So correct.\n\nSecond sample: input 6 3.\n\nInitial total=6, current_stubs=6.\n\n6/3=2 new candles. total becomes 8. current_stubs=0 +2=2. 2 <3, loop stops. So output is 8, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: what if a=5, b=5.\n\nInitially, 5→5 hours. current_stubs=5. 5/5=1 new. total 6. stubs now 1 (5%5=0) +1=1. So loop ends. Total 6.\n\nWhat about a=10, b=3.\n\nFirst run: 10/3=3, total 13. stubs 1 +3=4.\n\n4/3=1, total 14. stubs 1 +1=2.\n\nNo more. So total is 14.\n\nYes, because 10 +3 +1=14.\n\nSo the algorithm seems solid.\n\nNow, in Python, I can read a and b from input, compute this, and print.\n\nThe code structure would be:\n\nRead a and b from input line, split into integers.\n\nCompute as per above.\n\nPrint the result.\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n\n- a is exactly divisible by b multiple times, e.g., a=10, b=2. Then 10→10, then 5→5, then 2→2, then 1. So total 18.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\na=10, b=2.\n\ncurrent_stubs=10.\n\nnew=5, total 15. stubs: 0 +5=5.\n\nnew=2, total 17. stubs 1.\n\nNo more. Wait, wait. Or wait, 5//2 is 2, adding 2 to total, making 15+5=20? No, no, wait.\n\nWait, initial a=10.\n\nFirst iteration: current_stubs=10.\n\nnew_candles=5, total=15.\n\nstubs become (10%2=0) +5=5.\n\nSecond iteration: 5 >=2 → new=2, total=17. stubs:5%2=1 +2=3.\n\nThird iteration: 3 >=2 → new=1, total=18. stubs:3%2=1 +1=2.\n\nFourth iteration: 2 >=2 → new=1, total 19. stubs:0 +1=1.\n\nSo total is 19.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to simulate.\n\nSo code-wise, let's implement this.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\ncurrent = a\n\nwhile current >= b:\n\n    new = current // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    current = (current % b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code with a=10, b=2:\n\nInitial total=10, current=10.\n\nLoop:\n\ncurrent=10 >=2.\n\nnew=5, total=15.\n\ncurrent=0 +5=5.\n\nLoop again: 5>=2.\n\nnew=2, total=17.\n\ncurrent=5%2=1 +2=3.\n\nLoop: 3>=2.\n\nnew=1, total=18.\n\ncurrent=3%2=1 +1=2.\n\nLoop: 2>=2.\n\nnew=1, total=19.\n\ncurrent=0 +1=1.\n\nLoop ends.\n\nSo output is 19.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: a=1, b=1000. Output is 1.\n\nAnother test: a=999, b=2.\n\n999 /2 =499.5 → 499 new. Stubs 1 +499=500.\n\nThen 500/2=250. stubs 0+250=250.\n\n250/2=125 → stubs 0 +125=125.\n\n125/2=62. stubs 1 +62=63.\n\n63/2=31. stubs 1 +31=32.\n\n32/2=16. stubs 0 +16=16.\n\n16/2=8 → stubs 0 +8=8.\n\n8/2=4 → stubs 0 +4=4.\n\n4/2=2 → stubs 0 +2=2.\n\n2/2=1 → stubs 0 +1=1.\n\nSo total is 999 +499 +250 +125 +62 +31 +16 +8 +4 +2 +1 = let's calculate:\n\n999 +499 = 1498.\n\n+250 = 1748.\n\n+125=1873.\n\n+62=1935.\n\n+31=1966.\n\n+16=1982.\n\n+8=1990.\n\n+4=1994.\n\n+2=1996.\n\n+1=1997.\n\nSo total is 1997.\n\nYes, the code would handle this correctly.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the given candles. Each candle burns for one hour and then goes out, but Vasily can reuse the stubs from burned-out candles to create new ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles `a`.\n2. **Burn Candles**: Each candle burns for exactly one hour. Thus, initially, the total hours of illumination is equal to the number of candles `a`.\n3. **Reuse Stubs**: After burning a set of candles, collect the stubs. For every `b` stubs, Vasily can make a new candle. This process continues until the number of stubs is less than `b`.\n4. **Iterative Process**: Use a loop to repeatedly convert stubs into new candles and update the total hours of illumination. In each iteration, calculate how many new candles can be made from the current stubs, add these to the total hours, and update the number of stubs accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\ncurrent = a\n\nwhile current >= b:\n    new = current // b\n    total += new\n    current = (current % b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `a` and `b`, which are read and parsed.\n- **Initialization**: The total hours are initialized to `a` because each candle burns for one hour.\n- **Loop for Reusing Stubs**: While the number of stubs (`current`) is at least `b`, convert stubs into new candles. Each new candle contributes one more hour to the total.\n- **Updating Stubs**: After making new candles, update the stub count to include any leftover stubs plus the stubs from the newly burned candles.\n- **Termination**: The loop terminates when there are not enough stubs to make another new candle, and the total hours are printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently maximize the illumination time by reusing stubs as much as possible. The algorithm runs in O(log_b(a)) time complexity, which is efficient given the constraints.",
