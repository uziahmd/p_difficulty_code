Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Vasily has some candles and can make new ones from the leftover stubs. The goal is to find out how many hours he can keep the room lit. Let's see.\n\nThe problem says that each candle burns for one hour and then goes out. But when he has b stubs, he can make a new candle. So the process is: burn as many as possible, collect stubs, convert them into new candles, and repeat until he doesn't have enough stubs to make any more.\n\nHmm, let's think about the example given. For input 4 and 2: initially, he has 4 candles. He burns all of them, getting 4 stubs. Then he can make 4//2 = 2 new candles. Burning those gives 2 stubs. Now he has 2 stubs which is exactly b=2, so he makes another candle. That's 1 more hour. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 =7 hours.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Start with a candles.\n2. Burn them all, adding their count to the total hours.\n3. Collect the stubs (a) and then convert them into new candles by dividing by b. But wait, not just once—because each time you make new candles, those also become stubs after burning.\n4. Repeat this process until the number of stubs is less than b, meaning you can't make any more candles.\n\nSo the steps in code would be:\n\n- Initialize total_hours to 0.\n- While the number of candles (or stubs) is >= b:\n   - Burn all current candles, add to total_hours.\n   - Calculate how many new candles can be made: new_candles = current_stubs // b\n   - Add these new_candles to total_hours? Wait, no. Because when you make new candles, you use the stubs, but then each new candle will produce one stub. So it's better to model it as follows:\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to think in terms of the number of stubs. Each time you burn candles, you get stubs equal to the number burned. Then you can exchange stubs for new candles.\n\nLet me try to outline it step by step.\n\nLet’s say we have s stubs at any step.\n\n- When you burn a candle, it's because you have at least one. So, each candle you burn gives you one stub. But if you have multiple candles, like n, burning them all gives you n stubs.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is correct, but I should model it as:\n\ncurrent_stubs = a\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\nwhile True:\n\n    # Burn all current candles, adding to the total hours\n    total_hours += current_stubs\n\n    # Now, make new candles from the stubs\n    new_candles = current_stubs // b\n    remaining_stubs = current_stubs % b\n\n    if new_candles == 0:\n        break  # can't make more, exit loop\n\n    # Add the new candles' burning time\n    total_hours += new_candles\n\n    # The stubs now are the remaining plus the new ones after burning\n    # Because when you make new_candles, you use new_candles * b stubs\n    # So the remaining stubs are (current_stubs % b) + (new_candles) * 1?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. After burning current_stubs, you have current_stubs stubs. Then you use b stubs per new candle. So for each new candle, you get one stub after burning it. So the process is:\n\nYou have s stubs.\n\n1. You can make new_candles = s // b. These new_candles are added to the total_hours because each candle burns for an hour.\n2. The stubs after this process are (s % b) + new_candles (since each new candle contributes one stub).\n\nWait, yes. Because for each new candle, you take b stubs, burn it, and get one more stub. So the new stubs are (s mod b) + new_candles.\n\nSo the loop is:\n\ncurrent_stubs = a\ntotal_hours = 0\n\nwhile current_stubs >= b:\n\n    total_hours += current_stubs  # burning all current candles\n\n    new_candles = current_stubs // b\n    total_hours += new_candles  # adding the new candles' burning time\n\n    # calculate remaining stubs after this step\n    current_stubs = (current_stubs % b) + new_candles\n\nOnce current_stubs < b, we can't make any more candles, so we stop.\n\nBut wait, let's test this logic with the first example.\n\nExample 1: a=4, b=2.\n\nInitial current_stubs =4.\n\nLoop starts:\n\ntotal",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the given candles and the ability to create new candles from the stubs of burned ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each candle burns for exactly one hour before it goes out. Once a candle is burned, it becomes a stub. Vasily can convert `b` stubs into a new candle. The goal is to maximize the total hours the room is lit.\n2. **Intuition**: The process involves repeatedly burning existing candles to get stubs, converting those stubs into new candles, and then burning those new candles until no more new candles can be made.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Start with the initial number of candles `a`.\n   - Burn all current candles, adding their count to the total hours.\n   - Convert the stubs into new candles by dividing the number of stubs by `b`.\n   - Continue this process until the number of stubs is less than `b`, meaning no more new candles can be made.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The loop runs a finite number of times (specifically, until the stubs are insufficient to make a new candle), making the approach efficient with a time complexity of O(log_a(b)).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\ncurrent_stubs = a\n\nwhile current_stubs >= b:\n    total += current_stubs\n    new_candles = current_stubs // b\n    total += new_candles\n    current_stubs = (current_stubs % b) + new_candles\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start with `current_stubs` set to `a` and `total_hours` set to 0.\n- **Loop**: While there are enough stubs to make at least one new candle (`current_stubs >= b`):\n  - Burn all current candles, adding their count to `total_hours`.\n  - Calculate how many new candles can be made from the stubs (`new_candles`).\n  - Add the burning time of these new candles to `total_hours`.\n  - Update `current_stubs` to the remaining stubs plus the stubs from burning the newly made candles.\n- **Termination**: When `current_stubs` is less than `b`, exit the loop and print the total hours.\n\nThis approach ensures that we optimally use every possible stub to maximize the illumination time.",
