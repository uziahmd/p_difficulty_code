The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Xenia is trying to complete her tasks by moving around a ringroad. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem statement says that Xenia lives in a city with n houses arranged in a ring. The traffic is one-way and clockwise. She starts at house 1 and has m tasks. For each task i, she needs to be at house a_i. But not just that—she has to complete all tasks with numbers less than i. So, for example, if her tasks are [3, 2, 3], then she must be at 3 after the first task, then at 2 after the second, and then at 3 again after the third. Wait, no—wait, let me re-read that.\n\nOh right, the i-th task requires her to be at a_i when she does it, and also, all previous tasks (those with j < i) have been completed before the i-th. So she must visit each a_j for j=1 to m in order, but perhaps multiple times as needed.\n\nSo the key is that she must visit the a_1, then a_2, etc., up to a_m in the given order. Each time, she must be present at a_i during the processing of the i-th task. But the way she moves is constrained by the ring structure.\n\nEach move from one house to a neighboring one takes one unit of time. Since the ring is circular, moving clockwise or counterclockwise depends on the direction of the ring. Oh wait, no—the ring is one-way and the traffic is clockwise. So the only allowed direction is clockwise. That means she can't go back; once she leaves a house, she can't return to a previous one without going all the way around, which would take more time.\n\nWait, but the ring is a loop. So the houses are arranged in a circle, and the traffic is only allowed in one direction. So movement is strictly in the clockwise direction. So from any house, she can only move to the next higher-numbered house, wrapping around after n.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the minimal time path that starts at 1, and for each task a_i in order, visits a_i, ensuring that each a_i is visited after the previous ones.\n\nBut how do we model this? Let's think about the sequence of positions she must visit in order: a_1, a_2, ..., a_m. But since the ring is circular and she's moving only clockwise, there's an optimal way to traverse these points.\n\nWait, but the a_i's may not be in order. For example, in the sample input, the first test case is 4 3 with tasks 3,2,3. So the order is 3, then 2, then 3 again. But since the movement is clockwise, she can't go from 3 to 2 directly because that's counter-clockwise. So she has to go from 3 to 4, then to 1, then to 2, then to 3.\n\nHmm. So the approach is to process each task in order, and for each a_i, determine the earliest time she can arrive there after completing the previous task.\n\nWait, maybe we can model this as a state where we track the current position and the last time we were there. Then, for each new task, calculate the minimal time to reach a_i from the previous position, considering the ring structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to calculating the required distance between consecutive a_i's, considering the circular nature.\n\nLet me think about the sample input:\n\nTest case 1:\nn=4, m=3\na = [3,2,3]\n\nShe starts at 1. First task is at 3. The distance from 1 to 3 is 2 steps (1→2→3). So she arrives at 3 at time 2. Second task is at 2. From 3, she can't go back because the ring is one-way. So she has to go to 4, then to 1, then to 2. The distance from 3 to 2 via the other direction is 3 steps (3→4 is +1, 4→1 is +1, 1→2 is +1). So the time taken is 3 units, added to the previous 2, making it 5. Then, the third task is at 3 again. From 2, she needs to get to 3. Since she's at 2, the next is 3. So that's 1 step, adding to 5+1=6. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is 4 3 with a = [2,3,3]. So the sequence is:\n\nStart at 1. First task is at 2: distance 1 →2 is 1 step (time 1). Second task is at 3: from 2, the distance is 1 step (2→3, time increases by 1 to 2). Third task is at 3 again: 0 steps, so total time is 2.\n\nSo the output is 2.\n\nSo the idea is to compute the sum of the distances between consecutive a_i's, but taking into account the ring structure and the fact that movement is only possible in the clockwise direction.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the distance from a previous point to the next point?\n\nThe distance from x to y in a ring of n nodes, moving clockwise, is (y - x) mod n. But wait, since the movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction, the distance from x to y is the minimum number of steps to reach y by moving forward. So for example, if x is 3 and y is 2 in a ring of 4, moving clockwise, the distance is (2-3) mod 4? No, wait: 3 to 2 in a 4-node ring, moving clockwise, you have to go 3→4→1→2, which is 3 steps. Or (2-3) mod 4 is (-1) mod 4 = 3, which is correct.\n\nSo the general formula for the distance from a to b is (b - a) mod n. But if a > b, then it's (b + n - a), but in mod n terms, it's the same as (b - a) % n. Because for example, (2-3) mod4 is -1 mod4 = 3.\n\nWait, let's test: a=3, b=2, n=4. (2-3) mod4 is -1 mod4 = 3, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: a=2, b=3, n=4. (3-2)=1 mod4 is 1, correct.\n\nSo yes, the distance from a to b is (b - a) mod n.\n\nBut wait, since the movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction, we can't take a shorter path by going counterclockwise. So the distance is indeed (b - a) mod n.\n\nTherefore, the minimal time is the sum of the distances between consecutive a_i's, plus the initial distance from 1 to a_1.\n\nWait, but what about cases where a_i appears multiple times? Like in the first sample, the third task is 3 again. So the previous position was 2, and the next is 3. The distance is (3-2) mod4 =1. So it's added to the total.\n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n\n1. Start at position 1.\n\n2. For each task in order, compute the distance from the previous position to the current a_i, add it to the total time.\n\n3. Update the previous position to a_i.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Initialize current_position = 1, total_time =0.\n\n- For each a in the list of tasks:\n\n   - distance = (a - current_position) % n\n\n   - total_time += distance\n\n   - current_position = a\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nLet's test this with the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample:\n\ntasks = [3,2,3], n=4.\n\ncurrent_position starts at 1.\n\na_1=3: distance (3-1)%4=2. total_time=2.\n\ncurrent_position=3.\n\na_2=2: distance (2-3)%4= ( -1 )%4=3. total_time=2+3=5.\n\ncurrent_position=2.\n\na_3=3: distance (3-2)%4=1. total_time=5+1=6.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nSecond sample:\n\ntasks = [2,3,3], n=4.\n\ncurrent_position=1.\n\na_1=2: (2-1)=1. total_time=1.\n\ncurrent_position=2.\n\na_2=3: (3-2)=1. total_time=2.\n\ncurrent_position=3.\n\na_3=3: 0. total_time remains 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWhat about another test case? Let's think.\n\nSuppose n=5, m=2.\n\ntasks = [4,5].\n\nThen:\n\nstart at 1.\n\na_1=4: distance (4-1)=3. total_time=3.\n\ncurrent_position=4.\n\na_2=5: (5-4)=1. total_time=4.\n\nSo the answer is 4.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3, m=3.\n\ntasks = [3,1,3].\n\nWait, but movement is only clockwise. So from 3, she can't go back to 1 directly. So she has to go 3→1→2→3.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\ncurrent_position=1.\n\na_1=3: (3-1) mod3=2. time=2.\n\ncurrent_position=3.\n\na_2=1: (1-3) mod3= ( -2 ) mod3=1. time=3.\n\ncurrent_position=1.\n\na_3=3: (3-1) mod3=2. time=5.\n\nWait, but the sequence is 1→3 (distance 2), then from 3, she has to go to 1, which is a distance of 1, and then from 1 to 3 again, which is 2. Total 2+1+2=5.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo the algorithm seems solid.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nWe need to read n and m, then the list of a_i's.\n\nThen, compute the sum of the distances as described.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead the input: first line is n and m. Second line is the list of a_i.\n\nCompute the sum as follows:\n\nprev = 1\n\ntotal =0\n\nfor a in a_list:\n\n    distance = (a - prev) % n\n\n    total += distance\n\n    prev = a\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but in Python, negative mod is handled correctly. For example, (2-3) %4 is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be straightforward.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample:\n\nInput is '4 3\\n3 2 3'\n\nn=4, m=3, a=[3,2,3]\n\nprev=1\n\n3-1=2 → total=2, prev=3.\n\n2-3= -1 → mod4 is 3. total=5, prev=2.\n\n3-2=1 → total=6.\n\nOutput 6.\n\nSecond sample:\n\ninput is '4 3\\n2 3 3'\n\nn=4, m=3, a=[2,3,3]\n\nprev=1.\n\n2-1=1 → total=1, prev=2.\n\n3-2=1 → total=2, prev=3.\n\n3-3=0 → total remains 2.\n\nSo output is 2.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=2, a=[4,5] → output 3+1=4.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, m=3, a=[3,1,3] → 2+1+2=5.\n\nWhat about when a_i is 1 for all?\n\nE.g., n=2, m=3, a=[1,1,1]. So starting at 1.\n\nEach step adds 0. So total time is 0.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,2].\n\nFrom 1 to 2: distance 1. Then 2 to 2: 0. Total 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nSo the Python code is:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nRead the next line as a list of integers.\n\nInitialize prev =1, total=0.\n\nLoop through each a in the list:\n\n    distance = (a - prev) % n\n\n    total += distance\n\n    prev = a\n\nPrint total.\n\nBut wait, what if the list is empty? Well, according to the input constraints, m can be 1, but in the problem statement, m is >=1. So no problem.\n\nSo the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving clockwise around a ring of houses. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and she must complete each task in the given order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to visit several houses in a specific order. She can only move clockwise around the ring, meaning she cannot move back to a previous house without completing the entire loop.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two houses `a` and `b` when moving clockwise is calculated as `(b - a) % n`, where `n` is the total number of houses. This formula ensures that the distance is correctly computed considering the circular nature of the ring.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: Starting from house 1, for each task, compute the distance from the current house to the next required house and accumulate the total time taken.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprev = 1\ntotal_time = 0\nfor a in a_list:\n    distance = (a - prev) % n\n    total_time += distance\n    prev = a\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line reads the list of houses `a_list` where each element indicates the house Xenia needs to visit for each task.\n2. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with `prev = 1` and initialize `total_time` to 0.\n3. **Loop Through Tasks**: For each house `a` in `a_list`, compute the clockwise distance from the current house `prev` to `a` using `(a - prev) % n`, add this distance to `total_time`, and update `prev` to `a`.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, print the accumulated total time.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal time by leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ring, ensuring an optimal path for Xenia's tasks.",
