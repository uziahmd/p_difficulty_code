Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Vanya found some cards, and he needs to find the minimum number of additional cards to make the total sum zero. The cards can have any integer from -x to x, but each new card must be within that range.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. The problem is about finding the minimal number of cards needed such that when you add them to the existing sum, the total becomes zero. So, first, I should calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum 's'. Then, the goal is to find the smallest 'k' such that by adding 'k' numbers (each between -x and x), the sum becomes zero.\n\nWait, but each added card can be any value in that range. So the question is, what's the minimal k where s + (sum of new cards) = 0. That means the sum of new cards needs to be -s. Let's denote the required sum as 't', which is -s.\n\nSo, t = -s. We need to find the minimal number of integers (each between -x and x) that sum up to t. What's the minimal k for that?\n\nLet me think about the constraints. Each card can contribute at most x towards the sum (if positive) or at least -x. Wait, no, each card can contribute a maximum of x if it's positive, but a minimum of -x. But since we're trying to reach a target sum t, perhaps we can model this as: the minimal number of steps (cards) needed to reach t, with each step being between -x and x.\n\nWait, maybe another way to look at it: the minimal number of cards is the minimal k such that |t| ≤ k * x. Because each card can contribute up to x (if positive) or down to -x (if negative). So to reach t, we need enough cards so that their combined sum can reach t.\n\nBut wait, because each card can be any value, not just +x or -x. So the minimal k is the ceiling of |t| / x. Because each card can contribute at most x towards the sum. So if |t| is less than or equal to k*x, then it's possible.\n\nWait, let's test this idea with the examples.\n\nIn the first example:\n\nInput is 3 2, with cards [-1, 1, 2]. Sum s is (-1) + 1 + 2 = 2. So t is -2. So |t| is 2, x is 2. So 2/2=1. So k is 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nIn the second example:\n\nInput is 2 3, with cards [-2, -2]. Sum s is -4. t is 4. |t|=4, x=3. So 4/3 is approximately 1.333, so ceiling is 2. So k is 2, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: suppose n=1, x=5, and the card is 3. Sum s is 3, t is -3. |t|=3 <=5*1. So k is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=1, x=5, card is 6? No, wait, the input ensures that the numbers are within x. So in code, I don't have to handle that.\n\nWait, but what if t is zero? Like, if the sum is already zero. Then, no cards needed. So k is zero.\n\nWhat about cases where |t| is exactly divisible by x?\n\nLike, t is 6 and x is 3: 6/3=2, so k=2.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo the formula for k is max(ceil(|t| / x), ...). Wait, but what about other possibilities? For instance, can there be a scenario where even though |t| is less than or equal to k*x, but the sum can't be achieved with those k cards?\n\nI think no, because each card can be any value in the range. So for any t, as long as |t| <= k*x, it's possible.\n\nSo the minimal k is the minimal integer k such that |t| <= k * x.\n\nWhich is equivalent to k >= ceil( |t| / x )\n\nWait, but wait: If |t| is exactly divisible by x, then k is |t|/x. Otherwise, it's floor(|t|/x) + 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nCompute the sum of the found cards: s.\nt = -s\nif t == 0:\n    return 0\nelse:\n    k = ceil( abs(t) / x )\nSo that's the minimal number.\n\nWait, but what about when x is zero? Oh, wait, the problem says x is at least 1, so no.\n\nSo the steps for the solution are:\n\n1. Read n and x.\n2. Read the list of n integers.\n3. Compute sum s of these integers.\n4. Compute t = -s.\n5. If t is zero, output 0.\n6. Else, compute the absolute value of t, divide by x, take the ceiling, and that's the answer.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\nt = -s\nif t == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    import math\n    k = math.ceil(abs(t) / x)\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but wait: what if t is not an integer? No, t is always an integer because it's the negative of the sum of integers.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nLet me test with the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2\n\nsum is 2, t=-2.\n\nabs(t)=2, x=2. 2/2=1. So k=1.\n\nSecond sample:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2.\n\nSum is -4, t=4.\n\nabs(t)=4, x=3. 4/3 is 1.333..., so ceiling is 2.\n\nWhich matches the samples.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=1, x=5, card=[0]\n\nsum is 0, t=0 → output 0.\n\nAnother case:\n\nn=2, x=5, cards [3,3]. sum is 6. t=-6.\n\nabs(t)=6, x=5. 6/5=1.2 → ceiling is 2.\n\nSo two cards: each can be -3, sum -6. Or one card of -6, but wait, x is 5, so the maximum a single card can contribute is 5 (if positive) or -5 (if negative). So for t=-6, you can't do it with one card (since 6 >5). So two cards: each contributes -3.\n\nYes, so the code correctly returns 2.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all the numbers on these cards equals zero. Each card can have any integer value between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Target Sum**: The target sum is the negative of the current sum because we want the total sum (including the found and additional cards) to be zero.\n3. **Check for Zero Sum**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Cards**: If the target sum is non-zero, compute the minimum number of additional cards required. This is done by taking the ceiling of the absolute value of the target sum divided by x. This ensures that each card contributes as much as possible towards reaching the target sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\nt = -s\n\nif t == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    import math\n    k = math.ceil(abs(t) / x)\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of found cards `n` and the maximum absolute value `x`. It then reads the list of integers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed.\n3. **Target Sum**: The target sum is calculated as the negative of the current sum.\n4. **Zero Check**: If the target sum is zero, the result is immediately zero since no additional cards are needed.\n5. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: For a non-zero target sum, the minimum number of cards is determined by dividing the absolute value of the target sum by `x` and rounding up to the nearest integer using the ceiling function. This ensures that we account for the maximum contribution each card can make towards reaching the target sum.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of additional cards needed, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
