Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where Homer and Marge are playing a TV game. The goal is to maximize their total prize by choosing the sequence of moves optimally. Let me try to understand the problem.\n\nThe game starts with a number A that has 2n digits. Each player makes exactly n moves. In each move, the current player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their own number (S1 for Homer and S2 for Marge). Then, that digit is removed from A. So after each move, A gets shorter by one digit.\n\nOur task is to determine the order of moves (Homer and Marge) such that when all moves are done, both have exactly n digits, and their combined scores (the sum of their numbers) is as large as possible.\n\nHmm. So the key is to decide for each digit whether it's assigned to Homer or Marge in a way that maximizes the sum of their numbers. But since the order of taking the digits affects how we can assign them, it's not straightforward.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem. Since each player must take exactly n digits, the problem reduces to partitioning the 2n digits into two groups of n each, and assigning each group to a player. But the order in which the digits are taken affects the assignment because the leftmost digit is taken first, then the next, etc. So the assignment isn't just a grouping but also a permutation.\n\nWait, no. Because the order in which the digits are taken depends on the initial arrangement of A. So perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the order in which digits are picked, and for each position, decide whether the current player is H or M, trying to maximize the sum.\n\nBut considering all possible permutations would be computationally infeasible since 2n can be up to 36, leading to 36! possibilities, which is way too big.\n\nSo we need a dynamic programming approach or some greedy strategy that can work efficiently.\n\nAnother thought: since each digit's contribution to the sum depends on its position in the respective player's number, the earlier digits contribute more. For example, if a digit is placed in the first position of a player's number, it's worth 10^(n-1) times that digit. So, higher digits should be placed as early as possible in the player's number to maximize their contribution.\n\nWait, but the players take turns. So the first digit goes to either H or M, depending on who starts first. Wait, wait—no, the problem says that before each turn, they decide who will make the next move. So, the initial move could be H or M, but each player must make exactly n moves. Hmm, that complicates things because the order of the players can vary.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem statement says: \"each player should make exactly n moves.\" So the total number of moves is 2n, with each player making exactly n. So the order is a sequence of 2n choices, each being H or M, with exactly n H's and n M's.\n\nBut how do we model this? It's a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal strategy is to assign each digit to either H or M in such a way that the sum of all digits multiplied by their respective place values is maximized. But the place value depends on the order in which the digits are taken. So, for each digit, if it's in an earlier position in the overall picking order, it contributes more to the sum.\n\nWait, let's model this. Suppose that the digits are taken in the order d_1, d_2, ..., d_{2n}. Each digit d_i is assigned to either H or M, such that exactly n are assigned to each. The contribution of d_i to the sum is d_i multiplied by 10^{k}, where k is the number of digits remaining after d_i in the respective player's number.\n\nWait, no. Let's think: each player's number is built over n moves. So for H's number, the first digit taken is the first digit in his number, contributing d_1 * 10^{n-1}, the second is d_j * 10^{n-2}, and so on. Similarly for M's number.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the order of the digits in each player's number depends on the order in which they were taken. So the first digit taken by H is the first digit of his number, the second digit he takes becomes the second, etc. So the place value for H's digits depends on their position in the order of selection.\n\nSo the total sum is sum over all digits: d_i * (10^p), where p is the position in H's number (starting from 0 at the end, but wait, no—wait, the first digit taken by H is the highest place).\n\nWait, for example: suppose H's first move is '3', then his second is '5'. His number is 35, which is 3*10 +5*1 = 35. So the first digit contributes 10^{n-1}, the next 10^{n-2}, down to 10^0.\n\nSo the sum for H is sum_{i=1 to n} (d_i * 10^{n - i} ), and similarly for M.\n\nSo the total sum is sum_H + sum_M.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to selecting an ordering of the digits and assigning each digit to H or M, with exactly n to each, such that the sum of all d_i multiplied by their respective place values is maximized.\n\nBut the order is determined by the initial string A. Wait, no—the order in which digits are taken is the order of the initial string. Or is it?\n\nWait, no. Because the initial string is fixed as A. So the first digit taken is the first digit of A. Then, the second digit is the next one, and so on. So the order is fixed based on A. So the only choice is which player takes which digit. So the problem is to decide, for each position in A, whether it's taken by H or M, with the constraint that each takes exactly n digits.\n\nAh, okay, that's a crucial insight. So the digits are processed in the order they appear in A, and for each digit, we decide whether it's assigned to H or M, but ensuring that each gets exactly n digits.\n\nSo the problem reduces to selecting a subset of n positions in the 2n-digit string A to assign to H, and the rest to M, such that the sum of the digits multiplied by their respective place values is maximized.\n\nBut wait, each digit's position in A determines when it is taken. So for example, the first digit is taken first, then the second, etc.\n\nEach digit's contribution to the sum is d_i multiplied by 10^{(number of digits taken after it)} for their respective player.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Let's index the digits from 0 to 2n-1.\n\nFor each digit at position i in A:\n\n- If it's assigned to H, it is taken during the (i+1)-th move (since first move is 0-th?), and will be the (i+1)th digit in H's number. But since H's number has n digits, each new digit is added to the right. So the first digit (move 0) is the most significant, followed by move 1, etc.\n\nWait, no, the first digit taken is the first digit of A. So for H, if he takes the first digit, it's the first digit of his number. If he takes the third digit, it's the second digit of his number, and so on.\n\nSo for each digit at position i, if it's assigned to H, it will be the (count of digits taken before it by H) + 1-th digit in H's number. So the place value is 10^{(n - (count + 1))}.\n\nSimilarly for M.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nSuppose H takes the first and third digits, and M takes the second and fourth.\n\nThen:\n\n- The first digit is H's first digit: contributes 10^{n-1}.\n- The second digit is M's first digit: contributes 10^{n-1}.\n- The third digit is H's second digit: contributes 10^{n-2}.\n- The fourth digit is M's second digit: contributes 10^{n-2}.\n\nSo each digit's contribution depends on the order in which it's taken by their respective player.\n\nSo the problem is: assign each digit to H or M such that each gets exactly n digits, and the sum of each digit multiplied by 10 raised to the power of (n - (their position in their player's sequence + 1)) is maximized.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can model it with dynamic programming.\n\nLet's consider the process step by step. We have to process each digit in the order of A, and for each digit, decide whether to assign it to H or M, keeping track of how many digits each has already taken.\n\nAt any point, the state can be represented by the number of digits taken by H (h) and M (m), where h ranges from 0 to n, and m ranges from 0 to n, and h + m is the number of digits processed so far.\n\nFor each state (h, m), and for the current digit, we can choose to assign it to H or M, provided that h < n and m < n, respectively.\n\nThe DP transition would be:\n\ndp[i][h][m] = max(\n    dp[i-1][h][m] + (digit * 10^{n - (h + 1)}),\n    dp[i-1][h][m] + (digit * 10^{n - (m + 1)})\n)\n\nWait, but i represents the current digit being processed. So for each digit in A, starting from the first, we process it and update the DP state.\n\nBut wait, each digit is processed exactly once, and the order is fixed. So for each digit, we have a choice to assign to H or M, provided that the count hasn't exceeded n for either.\n\nSo the initial state is (h=0, m=0). After processing all 2n digits, the state should be (h=n, m=n).\n\nThe value of the DP is the maximum possible sum achievable up to the current digit, given the current h and m counts.\n\nSo the DP can be defined as follows:\n\n- dp[i][h][m] is the maximum sum achievable after processing the first i digits, with h digits assigned to H and m to M.\n\nThen, for each i, h, m, we can compute the next state by assigning the (i+1)-th digit to H or M, provided that h < n and m < n.\n\nThe base case is dp[0][0][0] = 0.\n\nWait, but the indices might get a bit tricky. Let me adjust:\n\nThe digits are numbered from 0 to 2n-1.\n\nWe can represent the DP as a 2D array where for each step, we track h and m.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 18, the DP state would be (h, m), with h and m up to 18 each. So the state space is 19x19 = 361, which is manageable.\n\nThe transitions would be:\n\nFor each digit d in A:\n\n   for h in 0..n:\n      for m in 0..n:\n          if current state is (h, m), then for the next digit, we can assign to H or M.\n\nBut wait, actually, the order is sequential. So for each digit in A, we process it, and for each possible state before processing, we can branch into assigning it to H or M, updating the state and the sum accordingly.\n\nSo the DP can be built as follows:\n\nInitialize a 2D array (current_h, current_m) with the maximum sum for that state.\n\nInitially, before processing any digits, the state is (0,0) with sum 0.\n\nFor each digit in A:\n\n   create a new 2D array (next_dp) to store the updated states.\n\n   for each possible (h, m) in current_dp:\n\n       if h < n:\n           assign the current digit to H: the place value is 10^{n - (h+1)}. So the new state is (h+1, m), and the sum increases by d * 10^{n - (h+1)}.\n       \n       if m < n:\n           assign the current digit to M: the place value is 10^{n - (m+1)}. So the new state is (h, m+1), and the sum increases by d * 10^{n - (m+1)}.\n\n   set current_dp to next_dp.\n\nAfter processing all digits, the state (n, n) will have the maximum sum. Then, we need to reconstruct the path to get the sequence of H and M assignments.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this DP correctly, considering the place values.\n\nBut wait, the place value depends on the order in which the digits are assigned to each player. So for each assignment, the place value is determined by how many digits have been assigned to that player before this one.\n\nFor example, if H has already taken h digits, and this is the (h+1)th digit assigned to him, it's placed in the (h+1)th position of his number, which has a place value of 10^{n - (h+1)}.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the steps for the DP are:\n\n1. Read n and the string A.\n\n2. Precompute the exponents: for each possible position in a player's number, compute 10^{position}, where position ranges from 0 to n-1.\n\n   For example, for a player's number length 4, the exponents are 10^3, 10^2, 10^1, 10^0.\n\n3. Initialize the DP table. The initial state is (h=0, m=0) with sum 0.\n\n4. For each digit in A:\n\n   a. Convert the character to an integer d.\n\n   b. For each possible (h, m) in the current DP state:\n\n      i. If h < n, assign the digit to H: new_h = h + 1, new_m = m. The contribution is d * 10^{n - (new_h)}.\n\n      ii. If m < n, assign the digit to M: new_m = m + 1, new_h = h. Contribution is d * 10^{n - (new_m)}.\n\n   c. Update the next_dp state with the maximum sum for each (new_h, new_m).\n\n5. After processing all digits, find the maximum sum among all states where h = n and m = n. There should be only one such state, but perhaps in cases of tie, multiple sequences may exist.\n\n6. Reconstruct the sequence of decisions (H or M for each digit) that leads to this maximum sum.\n\nNow, the issue is handling the exponents correctly. For each possible h and m, when assigning to H, the exponent is (n - (h + 1)) because the current assignment is the (h+1)th digit for H. So for H's (h+1)th digit, the place is 10^{n - (h+1)}.\n\nSimilarly for M.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the exponents can be precomputed. For each possible position from 0 to n, compute 10^{position}. For example, for n=3, exponents are [1000, 100, 10, 1].\n\nWait, no: for a player's number of length n, the first digit is multiplied by 10^{n-1}, the second by 10^{n-2}, etc., down to 10^0. So for the k-th digit (0-based) in the player's number, the exponent is 10^{n-1 -k}.\n\nBut when assigning a digit to H, say when H has h digits already, the current digit is the (h)th (0-based) digit in H's number, so the exponent is 10^{n-1 - h}.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to precompute an array pow10 where pow10[k] = 10^{n-1 -k}, for k from 0 to n-1. So when H has h digits, the next digit is added as the h-th (0-based) digit, so the exponent is pow10[h].\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let's clarify with an example.\n\nSuppose n=3, and H has already taken 0 digits (h=0). He takes the first digit, which is the first (0-based) digit in his number. The place value is 10^2 (since 3-1-0=2).\n\nIf he has already taken 2 digits (h=2), the next digit is the third (0-based) in his number, which is 10^0.\n\nSo for each h, the exponent is 10^{n-1 - h}.\n\nSo, for each h, the exponent is 10^{(n-1 - h)}.\n\nThus, the place value for adding a digit to H when h is current is 10^{(n-1 - h)}.\n\nSimilarly for M.\n\nSo, the exponents can be precomputed as an array of size n, where pow10[h] = 10^{(n-1 - h)}, for h in 0..n-1.\n\nWait, but when h reaches n, it's beyond the array. So perhaps the array should be of size n+1, with pow10[n] = 0.\n\nYes, because when h = n, the player cannot take any more digits.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n- Precompute pow10 for h from 0 to n.\n\npow10[0] = 10^{n-1}\n\npow10[1] = 10^{n-2}\n\n...\n\npow10[n-1] = 10^0\n\npow10[n] = 0.\n\nOnce this is done, during the DP, for each state (h, m), when assigning the current digit to H, the exponent is pow10[h], and for M, it's pow10[m].\n\nWait, no. Because when you assign the current digit to H, the new h becomes h+1, and the exponent is 10^{n-1 - (h+1)} = 10^{(n-1 - h) - 1} = 10^{(n - h -2)}.\n\nWhich is equal to pow10[h+1], assuming pow10 is defined as 10^{n-1 -k} for k from 0 to n.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the exponents.\n\nLet me see:\n\nWhen a digit is assigned to H, and the current h is h_current, then the new h is h_current + 1. The place value is 10^{n-1 - (h_current + 1)}.\n\nBecause for the h_current digits, the next one is the (h_current + 1)th digit in H's number, which is the (h_current + 1)th position (0-based), so the exponent is 10^{n-1 - (h_current + 1)}.\n\nWhich is equal to 10^{(n-1 - h_current) -1} = 10^{n - h_current -2}.\n\nBut that's the same as pow10[h_current + 1] if pow10[k] = 10^{n-1 -k}.\n\nWait, pow10[k] = 10^{n-1 -k}.\n\nSo for the new h = h_current + 1, the exponent is 10^{n-1 - (h_current + 1)} = 10^{n - h_current - 2}.\n\nBut pow10[h_current + 1] is 10^{n-1 - (h_current + 1)} = 10^{n - h_current - 2}.\n\nSo yes, the exponent is pow10[h_current + 1].\n\nWait, no. Let me compute:\n\npow10[k] = 10^{n-1 -k}.\n\nSo for the current h is h_current, and we are assigning to H, the new h is h_current + 1.\n\nThe exponent is 10^{n-1 - (h_current + 1)} = 10^{(n-1 -h_current) - 1} = 10^{(n-1 -h_current -1)} = 10^{n - h_current - 2}.\n\nWhich is equal to pow10[h_current + 1], because pow10[h_current +1] = 10^{n-1 - (h_current +1)}.\n\nYes, because:\n\npow10[h_current +1] = 10^{n-1 - (h_current + 1)} = 10^{n - h_current -2}.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nSo, when assigning to H, the exponent is pow10[h_current + 1].\n\nSimilarly, when assigning to M, the exponent is pow10[m_current + 1].\n\nThus, in the DP, for each state (h, m), when considering the current digit, the contribution to the sum is:\n\nif assigning to H: d * pow10[h + 1]\n\nif assigning to M: d * pow10[m + 1]\n\nSo, the plan is solid.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, read n and the string A.\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\n\nThen, precompute the pow10 array.\n\npow10 = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor k in range(n):\n    pow10[k] = 10 ** (n - 1 - k)\npow10[n] = 0  # though it won't be used.\n\nNext, initialize the DP.\n\nWe can represent the DP as a dictionary or a 2D array. Since n is up to 18, a 19x19 array is manageable.\n\nWe'll use a 2D array, where each cell (h, m) stores the maximum sum achievable up to that point.\n\nInitialize the DP as -infinity except for (0,0) which is 0.\n\ndp = [[-1 for _ in range(n+1)] for __ in range(n+1)]\ndp[0][0] = 0\n\nBut since n can be up to 18, the maximum sum is 2*(sum of digits)*max_pow, which is manageable with integers.\n\nBut perhaps using a 2D list of dictionaries or something else is better. Alternatively, using a list of lists where each cell holds the maximum sum.\n\nWait, perhaps for each step, we can keep a current DP table and a next DP table.\n\nSo, for each digit in A:\n\n   create a new next_dp table, initialized with -infinity.\n\n   for each possible h in 0..n:\n\n      for each possible m in 0..n:\n\n          if current_dp[h][m] is -1, skip.\n\n          current_sum = current_dp[h][m]\n\n          if h < n:\n\n              new_h = h + 1\n\n              new_sum = current_sum + digit * pow10[new_h]\n\n              if new_sum > next_dp[new_h][m]:\n                  next_dp[new_h][m] = new_sum\n\n          if m < n:\n\n              new_m = m + 1\n\n              new_sum = current_sum + digit * pow10[new_m]\n\n              if new_sum > next_dp[h][new_m]:\n                  next_dp[h][new_m] = new_sum\n\n   set current_dp = next_dp\n\nWait, but for each digit, we have to process all possible (h, m) states.\n\nBut in code, this can be implemented as follows.\n\nWait, but in Python, initializing a 19x19 grid for each step is manageable.\n\nSo, let's outline the code.\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\n\npow10 = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor k in range(n):\n    pow10[k] = 10 ** (n - 1 - k)\npow10[n] = 0  # Not used\n\n# Initialize DP\ncurrent_dp = [[-1 for _ in range(n+1)] for __ in range(n+1)]\ncurrent_dp[0][0] = 0\n\nfor digit_char in A:\n    digit = int(digit_char)\n    next_dp = [[-1 for _ in range(n+1)] for __ in range(n+1)]\n    \n    for h in range(n + 1):\n        for m in range(n + 1):\n            if current_dp[h][m] == -1:\n                continue  # Skip unreachable states\n            \n            # Assign to H\n            if h < n:\n                new_h = h + 1\n                contribution = digit * pow10[new_h]\n                if current_dp[h][m] + contribution > next_dp[new_h][m]:\n                    next_dp[new_h][m] = current_dp[h][m] + contribution\n            \n            # Assign to M\n            if m < n:\n                new_m = m + 1\n                contribution = digit * pow10[new_m]\n                if current_dp[h][m] + contribution > next_dp[h][new_m]:\n                    next_dp[h][new_m] = current_dp[h][m] + contribution\n    \n    current_dp = next_dp\n\n# After all digits, the best state is (n, n)\nbest_sum = current_dp[n][n]\n\n# Now, reconstruct the sequence of H and M assignments.\n\n# To reconstruct, we need to backtrack through the DP.\n\n# We'll create a list of characters, starting from the last digit to the first.\n\nsequence = []\nh = n\nm = n\n\nwhile h > 0 or m > 0:\n    # Check which state we came from.\n    # For the current h and m, the previous state was either (h-1, m) or (h, m-1).\n    # We need to find which assignment led to this state.\n\n    # Look for all possible previous states that could lead to current state.\n    max_prev = -1\n    prev_h = -1\n    prev_m = -1\n\n    for ph in range(h):\n        for pm in range(m):\n            if current_dp[ph][pm] == current_dp[h][m]:\n                # Check if from (ph, pm) to (h, m) is via H or M assignment.\n                # If h > ph, then it's an H assignment.\n                if ph + 1 == h:\n                    # Assigned to H\n                    sequence.append('H')\n                    # But we're moving backward, so this is the previous step.\n                    break\n                elif pm + 1 == m:\n                    # Assigned to M\n                    sequence.append('M')\n                    break\n        else:\n            continue\n        break\n\n    # Now, update h and m.\n    if h > 0:\n        h -= 1\n    else:\n        m -= 1\n\nsequence.reverse()\n\nprint(''.join(sequence))\n\nWait, but the reconstruction part may have issues. Because for each state (h, m), there might be multiple previous states that could lead to it, but the DP only tracks the maximum sum. So, during reconstruction, we need to find the path that leads to the maximum sum.\n\nBut in the way the DP is structured, each state (h, m) in current_dp contains the maximum sum achievable for that state. So, to reconstruct the path, for each state (h, m), we need to find the previous state that, when combined with the assignment to H or M, gives the maximum sum.\n\nBut this requires storing more information than just the sum; perhaps we need to store the path that leads to each state.\n\nAlternatively, for each state, we can track the direction (H or M) that was taken to reach it.\n\nBut that would complicate the DP.\n\nAnother approach is, for each state (h, m), to remember the previous state and the choice made (H or M) that led to it.\n\nBut this increases the memory usage. For 19x19 states, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, during reconstruction, for each state (h, m), we can look for all possible previous states (h-1, m) and (h, m-1), and see which one gives the maximum sum.\n\nWait, but in the DP, each state (h, m) is reached by either adding to H or M. So, for state (h, m), it could have come from (h-1, m) if the last digit was assigned to H, or from (h, m-1) if the last digit was assigned to M.\n\nBut since the DP only keeps track of the maximum sum, for each state, the previous state is either (h-1, m) or (h, m-1), whichever gives the maximum sum.\n\nBut wait, perhaps not. Because it's possible that both options could lead to the same sum, but the different choices would affect the path.\n\nBut in our reconstruction, we need to find any valid path that leads to the maximum sum. So, perhaps during reconstruction, for each state (h, m), we can check both possibilities (from H and from M) and choose the one that allows us to proceed.\n\nWait, but how do we know which path leads to the maximum sum? Because the current state's value is the maximum, perhaps the previous state that leads to it is the one that had the maximum sum before adding the current digit.\n\nSo, during reconstruction, for each (h, m):\n\n- if h > 0, then check if the state (h-1, m) exists in the previous step. The sum for (h-1, m) plus the contribution of H's assignment would be current_dp[h][m].\n\n- Similarly, check if (h, m-1) exists.\n\nWe can compare these two possibilities and choose the one that leads to the maximum sum.\n\nWait, but the previous step is not stored in the DP, only the current step. So, perhaps during the DP, for each state, we can also track the direction from which it was achieved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reconstruction can be done greedily by trying to assign each digit to H or M in a way that the sum is maximized, working backwards.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to process the digits in reverse order. For each digit, decide whether to assign it to H or M based on which option gives the maximum contribution, considering the current state.\n\nBut that might not be feasible because the decision for one digit depends on the previous decisions.\n\nHmm. So, going back to the reconstruction part.\n\nIn the code outline above, during the while loop, for each state (h, m), it tries to find the previous state by checking all possible (ph, pm) that could lead to it.\n\nBut that's time-consuming because for each state, it loops through all possible previous states.\n\nAn alternative is to track for each state (h, m) the possible previous states and the choice made.\n\nBut that would require more memory.\n\nAlternatively, during the DP steps, for each state (h, m), we can store the direction (H or M) that was taken to reach it.\n\nBut this can be done as follows:\n\nModify the DP to include a parent pointer. For each (h, m), we can track whether the last move was to H or M.\n\nBut for 19x19 states, this is manageable.\n\nSo, let's adjust the DP to include a 'prev' matrix indicating whether the last move was to H or M.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to track for each state (h, m), the last move.\n\nWait, let's think: when processing each digit, for each state (h, m), if it was reached by assigning to H, then the previous state was (h-1, m). Similarly, if it was reached by assigning to M, the previous state was (h, m-1).\n\nThus, during reconstruction, for each state (h, m), we can check whether it was reached via H or M.\n\nSo, during the DP steps, for each state (h, m), we can store which direction was taken.\n\nThus, during the DP step, for each (h, m) in next_dp, we can note whether it was assigned from H or M.\n\nSo, perhaps modifying the DP to include a 'last_move' matrix.\n\nBut perhaps that's getting too complex.\n\nAlternative idea: during the DP step, for each state (h, m), store not just the sum, but also whether it was reached by H or M. But that's not sufficient because sometimes a state can be reached via both paths, but only one of them contributes to the maximum sum.\n\nWait, but perhaps during the DP steps, for each state (h, m), we can record the direction that was taken to reach it with the maximum sum.\n\nSo, for each (h, m), we can track:\n\n- max_sum: the maximum sum achievable for (h, m)\n\n- last_move: 'H' or 'M' indicating whether the last digit was assigned to H or M.\n\nThus, during the DP step, for each (h, m) in next_dp, if it's reached via H, we set last_move to 'H'; similarly for M.\n\nThis way, during reconstruction, for each state (h, m), we can directly know whether the last digit was assigned to H or M.\n\nLet's adjust the code accordingly.\n\nSo, during the DP setup:\n\ncurrent_dp = [[ {'sum': -1, 'from_h': False, 'from_m': False} for _ in range(n+1)} for __ in range(n+1)]\ncurrent_dp[0][0]['sum'] = 0\n\nWait, perhaps better to track the direction that led to the maximum sum.\n\nAlternatively, for each (h, m), track the best way to reach it, either from H or M.\n\nBut perhaps the code can be adjusted as follows:\n\nInstead of initializing next_dp with -1, we can initialize it with None, meaning no path yet.\n\nThen, for each state (h, m) in current_dp:\n\n   if current_dp[h][m] is -1, skip.\n\n   digit is processed.\n\n   if assign to H:\n\n      new_h = h + 1\n\n      new_sum = current_sum + digit * pow10[new_h]\n\n      if next_dp[new_h][m] < new_sum:\n\n          next_dp[new_h][m] = new_sum\n\n          # Record that this state was reached by assigning to H.\n\n          # So, for next_dp[new_h][m], the last move is H.\n\n   if assign to M:\n\n      new_m = m + 1\n\n      new_sum = current_sum + digit * pow10[new_m]\n\n      if next_dp[h][new_m] < new_sum:\n\n          next_dp[h][new_m] = new_sum\n\n          # Record that this state was reached by assigning to M.\n\nThus, during the reconstruction, for each state, we can check whether it was reached via H or M.\n\nBut this requires storing additional information, which is manageable.\n\nSo, let's adjust the code.\n\nModify the DP initialization:\n\ncurrent_dp = [[None for _ in range(n+1)] for __ in range(n+1)]\ncurrent_dp[0][0] = (0, False, False)  # sum, from_h, from_m.\n\nThen, during the DP steps:\n\nfor each digit:\n\n   next_dp = [[None for _ in range(n+1)] for __ in range(n+1)]\n   \n   for h in 0..n:\n      for m in 0..n:\n          if current_dp[h][m] is None:\n              continue\n          sum_val, from_h, from_m = current_dp[h][m]\n          \n          # Assign to H\n          if h < n:\n              new_h = h + 1\n              new_m = m\n              contribution = digit * pow10[new_h]\n              new_sum = sum_val + contribution\n              \n              if next_dp[new_h][new_m] is None or next_dp[new_h][new_m] < new_sum:\n                  next_dp[new_h][new_m] = (new_sum, True, False)\n                  \n          # Assign to M\n          if m < n:\n              new_m = m + 1\n              new_h = h\n              contribution = digit * pow10[new_m]\n              new_sum = sum_val + contribution\n              \n              if next_dp[new_h][new_m] is None or next_dp[new_h][new_m] < new_sum:\n                  next_dp[new_h][new_m] = (new_sum, False, True)\n   \n   current_dp = next_dp\n\nWait, but during the assignment, if both H and M assignments are possible, we take the one with higher sum.\n\nThus, for each next_dp state, we choose the maximum sum between possible options.\n\nOnce the DP is filled, the state (n, n) will have the maximum sum and the direction(s) that led to it.\n\nBut it's possible that (n, n) can be reached via multiple paths with the same sum. So, during reconstruction, we can choose any of them.\n\nNow, during reconstruction, we can track the sequence by checking for each state whether it was reached via H or M.\n\nSo, let's adjust the reconstruction code.\n\nAfter obtaining the current_dp, which is now a 2D array of tuples (sum, from_h, from_m), we start from (n, n) and build the sequence.\n\nsequence = []\nh, m = n, n\n\nwhile h > 0 or m > 0:\n    if current_dp[h][m] is None:\n        break  # shouldn't happen\n    \n    sum_val, from_h, from_m = current_dp[h][m]\n    \n    if from_h:\n        sequence.append('H')\n        h -= 1\n    else:\n        sequence.append('M')\n        m -= 1\n    \nsequence.reverse()\n\nprint(''.join(sequence))\n\nWait, but in the initial setup, current_dp is a 2D array of tuples.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the sequence of moves for Homer and Marge in a TV game such that their combined scores are maximized.
