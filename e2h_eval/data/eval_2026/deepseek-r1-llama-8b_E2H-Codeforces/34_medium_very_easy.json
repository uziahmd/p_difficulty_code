And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. Hmm, let's see what the problem says.\n\nThe input is n and k, where n is the number of days and k is the number of consecutive days considered a week. Then there's a list of n integers representing each day's sleep time. My task is to compute the average over all possible weeks. Oh right, because each week is a window of k days, and there are (n - k + 1) such windows.\n\nWait, how do I approach this efficiently? Let's think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, for each window of size k, I need to sum up the sleep times in that window and then compute the average by dividing the total sum by the number of windows.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, the average per week is the sum of each week's total divided by the number of weeks. Each week contributes its own sum, which is the sum of the k elements in that window. So overall, the average is the total sum of all the k-day sums divided by the number of windows, which is (n - k + 1).\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Read the input: n, k, and the list of a's.\n2. Compute the sum of each window of size k.\n3. Sum all those window sums to get the total.\n4. Divide the total by the number of windows to get the average.\n5. Output the average with sufficient precision.\n\nBut wait, doing this naively would involve for each window, iterating through the elements and adding them up. For example, for each i from 0 to (n -k), sum a[i] + a[i+1] + ... + a[i+k-1]. If n is up to 2e5, then this approach would be O(nk), which could be 2e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way to compute these window sums. Oh right! Using a sliding window technique with a prefix sum array.\n\nYes, the prefix sum array can help here. Let me outline that.\n\nCompute the prefix sum array S where S[0] = 0 and S[i] = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[i-1], for i >=1. Then, the sum of the window starting at index i (0-based) is S[i + k] - S[i].\n\nSo for all i from 0 to (n -k), the sum of the window is S[i + k] - S[i]. The total sum is the sum of all these differences.\n\nAlternatively, since each window is a consecutive k elements, the sum of all windows is equal to the sum of all a's multiplied by the number of windows, minus the sum of the first (n - k) elements multiplied by 1, but I'm not sure. Maybe the sliding window with prefix sum is easier.\n\nSo, first, compute the prefix sum array. Then, for each window, compute the sum as S[i +k] - S[i], and accumulate the total.\n\nOnce I have the total, divide by the number of windows (which is n -k +1) to get the average.\n\nLet me test this logic with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 3:\n8 2\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nNumber of windows is 8-2+1=7.\n\nCompute the prefix sum:\nS[0] =0\nS[1]=1\nS[2]=3\nS[3]=7\nS[4]=100007\nS[5]=100130\nS[6]=100576\nS[7]=100365\nS[8]=100366\n\nThen, for each window:\ni=0: sum is S[2]-S[0]=3\ni=1: S[3]-S[1]=4\ni=2:7-3=4?\nWait wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate the prefix sum correctly.\n\nWait, a is [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]. So:\n\nS[0] =0\nS[1] =1\nS[2] =1+2=3\nS[3] =3+4=7\nS[4] =7+100000=100007\nS[5] =100007+123=100130\nS[6] =100130+456=100586\nS[7] =100586 +789=101375\nS[8] =101375 +1=101376\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier. So let's recalculate:\n\na[0] =1\na[1]=2\na[2]=4\na[3]=100000\na[4]=123\na[5]=456\na[6]=789\na[7]=1\n\nSo:\n\nS[0]=0\nS[1]=1\nS[2]=1+2=3\nS[3]=3+4=7\nS[4]=7+100000=100007\nS[5]=100007+123=100130\nS[6]=100130+456=100586\nS[7]=100586+789=101375\nS[8]=101375+1=101376\n\nNow, the windows are:\n\ni=0: 1+2=3 → S[2]-S[0]=3\ni=1:2+4=6 → S[3]-S[1]=7-1=6?\nWait, no. Because window i=1 is a[1] +a[2] =2+4=6. Yes.\n\nWait, wait, for i in 0 to (n-k). Since n=8, k=2, i runs from 0 to 6 (inclusive), which is 7 windows.\n\nSo each window sum is:\n\ni=0: S[2]-S[0] =3-0=3\ni=1: S[3]-S[1] =7-1=6\ni=2: S[4]-S[2]=100007-3=100004\ni=3:S[5]-S[3]=100130-7=100123\ni=4:S[6]-S[4]=100586-100007=579\ni=5:S[7]-S[5]=101375 -100130=1245\ni=6:S[8]-S[6]=101376 -100586=790\n\nNow, let's add all these:\n\n3 +6 =9\n+100004=100013\n+100123=200136\n+579=200715\n+1245=201,960?\nWait, wait, 200715 +1245 is 201,960?\n\nWait 200715 + 1245 = 201,960? Let me calculate:\n\n200,715 + 1,245 = 202, 000? No, wait 200,715 + 1,245 is 201,960. Yeah.\n\nThen adding 790: 201,960 +790= 202,750.\n\nSo the total sum is 202,750. Divided by 7 (number of windows) gives 202750 /7= approximately 28964.2857142857...\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the logic seems correct.\n\nNow, the plan is:\n\n1. Read n and k.\n2. Read the list a.\n3. Compute the prefix sum array.\n4. Iterate over each window (i from 0 to n-k inclusive), compute the sum for the window using the prefix array.\n5. Sum all those sums into a total.\n6. Divide total by (n -k +1) to get the average.\n7. Output with enough decimal digits.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nIn Python, reading the input is straightforward. But for large n (up to 2e5), we need to process this efficiently.\n\nThe prefix sum can be computed in O(n) time, and then the window sums are computed in O(n) time as well.\n\nSo for n=2e5, the code should run quickly.\n\nNow, implementing the prefix sum:\n\nCompute S where S[0]=0, S[1] = a[0], S[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc.\n\nWait no: S[i] is the sum of the first i elements. So for the ith element in a (0-based), it's a[0] + ... +a[i-1].\n\nSo for the window starting at index i, the end is i +k. So the sum is S[i +k] - S[i].\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n, k.\n\na = list of integers.\n\nCompute prefix sum as follows:\n\nprefix = [0] * (n +1)\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\nThen, for each i in 0 to (n -k):\n\nsum_window = prefix[i +k] - prefix[i]\n\nAdd to total.\n\nBut wait, for i from 0 to (n -k): the maximum i is (n -k), because i +k must be <=n. Because when i = n -k, i +k =n.\n\nSo the loop runs for i in 0, 1, ..., (n -k), which is (n -k +1) iterations.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ntotal =0\nfor i in range(n -k +1):\n    total += prefix[i +k] - prefix[i]\n\naverage = total / (n -k +1)\n\nThen, print the average with enough decimal places.\n\nNow, the output requires that the absolute or relative error is within 1e-6, so we need to print at least 6 decimal digits after the point. But sometimes, more digits may be needed if the division doesn't terminate exactly.\n\nIn Python, we can format the output to have, say, 10 decimal digits, but we need to avoid scientific notation.\n\nSo, the code can be:\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the third case has an average that is 202750/7 = 28964.2857142857..., which when printed with 10 decimal digits becomes 28964.2857142857.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\nCase where k equals n: then there's only one window, which is the entire array. So the average is the sum of the array divided by 1.\n\nAnother case: n=1 and k=1: same as above.\n\nAnother case: when all elements are the same, like all 5. Then the average is 5.\n\nWhat about when k is 1? Then each element is a window, so the average is the sum of all elements divided by n.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nn=3, k=2. So windows: [3,4], [4,7]. Their sums are 7, 11. Total is 18. Average is 18/(2) =9. So output is 9.0000000000.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\nn=1, k=1: one window. Sum is 10. Average 10.\n\nSample Input3: as before.\n\nSo the code should handle all these.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nRead the input:\n\nWe can read from stdin. In Python, perhaps something like:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nCompute the prefix sum:\n\nprefix = [0]*(n+1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n\nCompute total:\n\ntotal =0\nfor i in range(n -k +1):\n    total += prefix[i +k] - prefix[i]\n\naverage = total / (n -k +1)\n\nPrint with 10 decimal digits.\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but in the third sample, the output is given as '28964.2857142857', which is 10 digits after the decimal? Or 10 digits including trailing zeros?\n\nWait, the problem statement says to output the real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal. So perhaps formatting to 10 digits is sufficient.\n\nYes, because 10 digits is more than enough.\n\nBut in Python, when you use .10f, it will show 10 digits, possibly truncating or rounding. So that's acceptable.\n\nTesting the code with the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\nprefix is [0,3,7,14]\n\nwindows: i=0: 3+4=7; i=1:4+7=11. Sum 18. average 9. So output 9.0000000000.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=1, k=1, a=[10]. Only one window, sum 10. average 10.\n\nSample 3: as discussed.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, k=2. a = [5,5]. Sum is 10. average 5. Output 5.0000000000.\n\nAnother test case: n=4, k=3.\n\na = [1,2,3,4]. Windows: [1,2,3], [2,3,4]. Sums 6 and 9. Total 15. average 15/(2)=7.5 → 7.5000000000.\n\nSo yes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks, where each week is defined as a sequence of consecutive days. The goal is to compute the average sleep time efficiently given the constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We are given `n` days of sleep data and `k` days that form a week. We need to consider all possible sequences of `k` consecutive days, compute their sums, and then find the average of these sums.\n2. **Efficient Sum Calculation**: Directly summing each window of `k` days would be inefficient for large `n`. Instead, we use a prefix sum array to quickly compute the sum of any subarray in constant time.\n3. **Prefix Sum Array**: This array helps in calculating the sum of any subarray in O(1) time. The sum of elements from index `i` to `j` (inclusive) can be found using `prefix[j+1] - prefix[i]`.\n4. **Sliding Window Technique**: Using the prefix sum array, we compute the sum of each window of size `k` efficiently by iterating through the array once.\n5. **Average Calculation**: Sum all the window sums and divide by the number of windows to get the average sleep time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    # Compute prefix sums\n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n    \n    total = 0\n    for i in range(n - k + 1):\n        total += prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]\n    \n    average = total / (n - k + 1)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing daily sleep times.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: We construct a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` represents the sum of the first `i` elements of the sleep data.\n3. **Sliding Window Sum**: For each possible starting point of a window of size `k`, we compute the sum using the prefix sum array and accumulate the total sum of all windows.\n4. **Average Computation**: The total sum of all windows is divided by the number of windows to get the average sleep time, which is then printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles all edge cases, providing the correct result within the required precision.",
