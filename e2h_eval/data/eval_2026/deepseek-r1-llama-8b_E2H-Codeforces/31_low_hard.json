Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Vanya found some cards, and he needs to find the minimum number of additional cards to make the total sum zero. The cards can have any integer from -x to x, but each new card must be within that range.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. The problem is about finding the minimal number of cards needed such that when you add them to the existing sum, the total becomes zero. So, the initial sum is S. Then, we need to find a subset of numbers (each between -x and x) that when added together gives a value of -S, and the count of these numbers is as small as possible.\n\nWait, right. So the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate the current sum S of the found cards.\n2. We need to find a way to reach a total sum of -S by adding some new cards. Each new card can contribute at most x towards reducing the deficit or increasing the surplus.\n3. The goal is to minimize the number of cards added.\n\nSo, the first thing is to compute the sum of the given cards. Let's call this sum_total.\n\nThen, the required sum we need to achieve with additional cards is target = -sum_total.\n\nIf the target is zero, then no more cards are needed. But in the general case, we need to find how many cards to add so their sum is target, with each card's absolute value at most x.\n\nBut wait, each card can be any value between -x and x, but when considering the sum, it's better to maximize each card's contribution towards the target. Because to minimize the number of cards, each card should contribute as much as possible towards the target.\n\nSo, for example, if the target is positive, each new card can contribute up to x. So the minimal number of cards is ceil(target / x). But wait, what if the target is negative? Then each card can contribute up to x in the negative direction, but we can have each card be -x, which would subtract x from the total. So again, the minimal number of cards is ceil(abs(target) / x).\n\nBut wait, what about when target is zero? Then no cards are needed.\n\nLet's test this logic with the examples given.\n\nFirst example: input is 3 cards, x=2. The cards are -1, 1, 2. Sum is (-1 +1 +2) = 2. So target is -2. So how many cards? We need to add a sum of -2. Since each card can contribute up to 2 in the negative direction, one card is enough. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond example: input is 2 cards, x=3. The sum is (-2) + (-2) = -4. Target is 4. Each card can contribute up to 3, so 4/3 is 1.333..., so ceiling is 2. So two cards: 3+1 is not allowed, because each card can't exceed x. Wait, no—each card can be at most x in absolute value. So for the target 4, each card can contribute up to 3. So 3 +1 is not allowed because 1 is less than 3. So actually, each card can contribute up to 3, so the minimal is 2: 3 +1 is invalid because 1 is within x, but wait, 3 is allowed, but 4-3=1, so yes, that's two cards. So sample output is 2.\n\nAnother test case: say sum is 5, x=3. Target is -5. To reach -5, each card can contribute at most 3. So 5/3 is 1.666..., so ceiling is 2. Because 3 + 2 =5, but wait, no. Wait, target is -5, so we need the sum of the added cards to be -5. So each card can contribute up to 3 (but can be negative). So the maximum per card is 3 towards the negative, meaning each can contribute -3. So two cards: -3 + -3 = -6. That's too much. Or maybe using 3 and -2: 3 + (-2) =1, which isn't -5. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no. The added cards' sum should be equal to the target. So target is T. Each added card can contribute any value between -x and x. So to get the sum T with as few cards as possible, each card should contribute as much as possible towards T.\n\nFor example, if T is positive, each card contributes +x. For T negative, each contributes -x.\n\nSo the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of |T| divided by x.\n\nBut wait, what if |T| is exactly divisible by x? Then",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards (found and additional) equals zero. Each card can have a value between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: Compute the sum of the values on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Target Sum**: The target sum needed from the additional cards is the negative of the current sum. This is because we want the total sum to be zero.\n3. **Compute the Minimum Number of Cards**: To achieve the target sum with the fewest cards, each additional card should contribute as much as possible towards the target. The maximum contribution per card is x. Therefore, the minimum number of cards required is the ceiling of the absolute value of the target sum divided by x.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_total = sum(cards)\ntarget = -sum_total\n\nif target == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Compute the minimal number of cards needed\n    min_cards = (abs(target) + x - 1) // x\n    print(min_cards)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers followed by a list of integers. The first integer is the number of found cards, and the second is the maximum absolute value allowed on any card.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Calculate the sum of the found cards.\n3. **Target Calculation**: The target sum for the additional cards is the negative of the found cards' sum.\n4. **Determine Minimum Cards**: Using the formula `(abs(target) + x - 1) // x`, we compute the minimum number of cards needed to reach the target sum, ensuring each card contributes the maximum possible value towards the target.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of cards needed using basic arithmetic operations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of input constraints.",
