Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to check if the pile of letters can exactly form the two names given. Hmm, right.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again. Oh right, the input consists of three lines: guest's name, host's name, and the pile. We need to check if the pile is exactly equal to the combination of both names. So, the count of each letter in the pile should match the combined letters from both names.\n\nSo, the approach is to take all the letters from the first two lines, count them, and then compare with the third line's counts. If they match, output YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, but how do I handle the inputs? Oh, each line is a string, and I can process each character in them.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three lines.\n2. Concatenate the first two lines into one string.\n3. Count the frequency of each character in this concatenated string.\n4. Do the same for the third line (the pile).\n5. Compare the two frequency dictionaries. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nIn Python, I can use the collections.Counter class for this. It's efficient and handles the counting well.\n\nWait, but what about case sensitivity? The problem states that all lines are uppercase letters, so no issue there.\n\nSo, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nCase 1: All letters are same as required, so YES.\n\nCase 2: The total letters in the pile are less than the sum of the other two, so NO.\n\nCase 3: The pile has extra letters not present in the first two names.\n\nBut the Counter will handle all that, since it'll count all letters in the pile, including any extras. So when we compare, the counters would differ.\n\nAnother thing to consider: empty strings? No, because the problem says each line is not empty.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, read the three lines.\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, combine guest and host:\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nThen, create counters for combined and pile.\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ncount_combined = Counter(combined)\ncount_pile = Counter(pile)\n\nIf count_combined == count_pile, print YES else NO.\n\nWait, that's it?\n\nYes, because Counter will count each occurrence of each character. So if all letters and their counts match, then the pile can be rearranged to form the two names.\n\nSo, the code would look like this.\n\nBut wait, what about the order of the letters? Oh, it doesn't matter because we're just checking for exact counts, not the order.\n\nSo, the code seems straightforward.\n\nTesting with the example:\n\nSample Input 1:\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, no, the sample input is actually three separate lines. So, the first line is guest, second is host, third is pile.\n\nWait, in the example, the output is YES. Let me see why.\n\nThe combined guest and host's letters must match the pile.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in thinking the code.\n\nWait, no. Because the guest is the first line, host is the second, and the pile is the third. So the combined guest and host should equal the pile.\n\nWait, in the first sample, the guest is SANTACLAUS, host is DEDMOROZ. So combined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ.\n\nThe pile is BABBONATALE FATHERCHRISTMAS BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example. But regardless, the code will correctly count each letter.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the output is YES, which implies that the pile's letters exactly match the combined guest and host letters.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nWhat about the second sample? It outputs NO because one letter is missing and another is extra.\n\nThe code will catch that because the counters won't match.\n\nThird sample: extra L, so the counters differ.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nAnother test case: when the guest is \"A\", host is \"A\", pile is \"AA\". Then output is YES.\n\nIf pile is \"A\" then NO.\n\nIf guest is \"AB\", host is \"CD\", pile is \"ABCD\", output is YES.\n\nWhat about if the guest is \"AAB\", host is \"BBA\", pile is \"ABBB\"? Then count is A:2, B:3. Guest+host: A:2, B:2. Pile has more B's, so output NO.\n\nSo, the code should handle all these.\n\nNow, time to write the code.\n\nI think the code is as follows:\n\nRead three lines, strip any newlines (but in Python, input().strip() takes care of leading/trailing whitespace, including newlines).\n\nWait, no. Because the input is provided via standard input, each line is separated by '\\n'. So when reading with input(), each call reads a single line without the trailing newline. So, perhaps using .strip() is unnecessary, but better safe than sorry.\n\nWait, for example, if the guest line ends with a newline, guest = input().strip() would remove it, which is correct because the actual letters are the ones before the newline.\n\nSo, yes, using .strip() is correct.\n\nSo, code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Read the three lines\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\n# Combine guest and host\ncombined = guest + host\n\n# Count characters\ncount_combined = Counter(combined)\ncount_pile = Counter(pile)\n\nif count_combined == count_pile:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nThat's the code.\n\nI think that's all. It should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the pile of letters found at the door can be rearranged to form the names of the guest and the host exactly. This means that the pile must contain exactly the same letters as the combined names of the guest and the host, with no extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the three lines of input which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names:** Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Count Characters:** Use a character counting method (e.g., `collections.Counter`) to count the frequency of each letter in both the combined names and the pile.\n4. **Compare Counts:** Check if the character counts of the combined names match those of the pile. If they do, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the exact match of letters using a linear scan and comparison of character counts, making it both time and space efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Read the three input lines\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\n# Combine the guest and host names\ncombined = guest + host\n\n# Count the occurrences of each character in the combined string and the pile\ncount_combined = Counter(combined)\ncount_pile = Counter(pile)\n\n# Compare the two counters\nif count_combined == count_pile:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The input is read line by line, ensuring we get the guest's name, host's name, and the pile of letters.\n- **Combining Names:** By concatenating the guest's and host's names, we create a single string that represents all the letters that should be present in the pile.\n- **Character Counting:** Using `Counter` from the `collections` module, we count how many times each letter appears in both the combined names and the pile.\n- **Comparison:** The counts are compared, and if they match exactly, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the names; otherwise, it cannot.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures that the problem constraints are met, providing the correct output based on the character counts.",
