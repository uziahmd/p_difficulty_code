He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to check if a given string can be formed in a specific way. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem says that the string is built by three people: A, B, and C. A creates a string of some 'a's, then B appends some 'b's, and finally C appends some 'c's. But there are certain conditions:\n\n1. After A and B, the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n2. C appends 'c's such that the count of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string after B added their part.\n3. The order of the characters must be correct: all 'a's first, then 'b's, then 'c's.\n\nSo the task is to verify if the given string meets all these conditions.\n\nHmm, let's break down what needs to be done.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input string and count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's. Also, I need to make sure the order is correct: no 'b's before 'a's, no 'c's before 'b's.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the string is constructed as A adds 'a's, then B adds 'b's, then C adds 'c's. So the correct order is that the string should consist of a block of 'a's followed by a block of 'b's followed by a block of 'c's. So any other order would immediately make it invalid.\n\nFor example, in the second sample input, 'bbacc' is invalid because the 'b's come before any 'a's.\n\nSo the first step is to check the order. If the string isn't in the form of a^+ b^+ c^+, then it's automatically \"NO\".\n\nThen, assuming the order is correct, I need to check the counts.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- count_a = number of 'a's\n- count_b = number of 'b's\n- count_c = number of 'c's\n\nNow, after B adds their part, the string has count_a 'a's and count_b 'b's. Then C adds 'c's, and the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b. Also, count_a and count_b must each be at least 1 because the problem says that after A and B, there's at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Check if the string is ordered correctly: a's first, then b's, then c's. If not, return NO.\n2. Count the number of a's, b's, and c's.\n3. If count_a is zero or count_b is zero, it's invalid (since after A and B, both must exist).\n4. Check if count_c equals count_a or count_b. If not, invalid.\n5. Also, ensure that count_c is at least 1 because C appends some 'c's.\n\nWait, wait. Because C appends \"some number of letters 'c'\". So the count_c must be >=1.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- Check order: the string must be all a's, then all b's, then all c's. So, for example, if the string has 'ababc', it's invalid because after 'a's and 'b's, it's followed by more 'a's and 'b's, which violates the structure.\n- Check that count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n- Check that count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nSo how do I check the order? Well, the string should have a sequence where all 'a's come before any 'b's, and all 'b's come before any 'c's.\n\nOne way to do this is to iterate through the string and see if there's any character that comes after a higher character in the order a < b < c. For example, if a 'b' is found before any 'a's, it's invalid.\n\nAlternatively, we can split the string into runs. Each run is a consecutive same character. Then, the runs must be exactly ['a', 'b', 'c'] in order.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for the string, we can create a list of runs. For example, 'aaabccc' has runs a, b, c. 'aabc' has runs a, b, c. 'abba' has runs a, b, a, b—invalid.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Split the string into runs. Each run is a group of same characters.\n2. Check that the runs are exactly ['a', 'b', 'c'] in order, with counts >=1 each.\n   - If the number of runs is not 3, it's invalid.\n   - The first run must be 'a', second 'b', third 'c'.\n3. Now, check the counts:\n   - count_a = len(runs[0])\n   - count_b = len(runs[1])\n   - count_c = len(runs[2])\n   - All counts must be >=1.\n   - count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, output YES; else, NO.\n\nSo now, how to implement this in Python.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\nRead the input string S.\n\nCheck if the string is in the correct order.\n\nHow to split into runs:\n\nInitialize a list called runs.\n\ncurrent_char = S[0]\ncount = 1\nfor i from 1 to len(S)-1:\n    if S[i] == current_char:\n        count +=1\n    else:\n        add (current_char, count) to runs\n        current_char = S[i]\n        count =1\nadd the last current_char and count.\n\nOnce we have the runs, check:\n\n- len(runs) == 3. Otherwise, invalid.\n- runs[0][0] == 'a'\n- runs[1][0] == 'b'\n- runs[2][0] == 'c'\n\nAlso, check that each run has at least 1 character.\n\nOnce the runs are valid, proceed to check counts.\n\nCompute count_a = runs[0][1], count_b = runs[1][1], count_c = runs[2][1].\n\nCheck if count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nThen, check if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nIf all these, output YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but what about cases where the runs are longer than 3? Like, for example, 'aaaabbbbc' is allowed, but 'aaabbbaac' is not.\n\nWait, in the case of 'aaaabbbbc', the runs are a, b, c. So that's okay.\n\nBut for 'aaabbbbaaa', the runs are a, b, a, a. Which is invalid because after the b, there are a's again.\n\nSo the code correctly captures this because the runs would be a, b, a, which doesn't match the required order.\n\nSo the plan is solid.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nTest case 1: 'a' → invalid because after A and B, there must be at least one 'a' and 'b'. So count_a=1, count_b=0 → invalid.\n\nTest case 2: 'ab' → after B, count_b=1, but C hasn't added any 'c's. So count_c=0. So invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → runs are a, b, c. count_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=1. So count_c is equal to both a and b. So valid → YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbbc' → runs a, b, c. count_a=2, count_b=3, count_c=1. So count_c is 1, which is not equal to either a or b. So invalid.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaabbbccc' → count_a=3, count_b=3, count_c=3. So count_c equals both. Valid → YES.\n\nWhat about 'aaabbbcccaaa'? No, because after the c's, there are a's again. So runs are a, b, c, a. So invalid.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → a's, then b's, then c's. count_a=1, count_b=3, count_c=1. So count_c is 1, which is equal to count_a. So YES.\n\nWait, but in this case, after B, the count_b is 3, and C adds 1 c. So yes, 1 equals count_a.\n\nSo the code would return YES.\n\nAnother case: 'abba' → invalid because runs are a, b, a, which is not a, b, c.\n\nSo, in the code, the runs are checked for exactly a, then b, then c.\n\nNow, let's think about the initial steps.\n\nImplementing the runs:\n\nIn Python, we can loop through the string, track the current run, and collect the runs.\n\nLet me write some code:\n\ndef get_runs(s):\n    if not s:\n        return []\n    runs = []\n    current_char = s[0]\n    count = 1\n    for c in s[1:]:\n        if c == current_char:\n            count +=1\n        else:\n            runs.append( (current_char, count) )\n            current_char = c\n            count =1\n    runs.append( (current_char, count) )\n    return runs\n\nThen, in the main function:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nruns = get_runs(s)\n\nif len(runs) !=3:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if runs[0][0] != 'a' or runs[1][0] != 'b' or runs[2][0] != 'c':\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        count_a = runs[0][1]\n        count_b = runs[1][1]\n        count_c = runs[2][1]\n        if count_a <1 or count_b <1 or count_c <1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        elif count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's said that after B appends his part, the string has at least one a and one b. So in the runs, count_a and count_b must be >=1.\n\nSo the code correctly checks that.\n\nTesting against the examples:\n\nFirst example: 'aaabccc' → runs are a:3, b:1, c:3. So count_c is 3 which equals a's count. So YES.\n\nSecond example: 'bbacc' → runs are b:2, a:1, c:2. The runs don't start with a. So invalid, output NO.\n\nThird example: 'aabc' → runs are a:2, b:1, c:1. So count_c is 1, which is equal to count_b. So YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → runs are a:1, b:1, c:1. So count_c is 1, equal to a and b. So YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'abbbc' → a:1, b:3, c:1. So count_c is 1 equals a. So YES.\n\nWhat about 'aabbbc'? runs are a:2, b:3, c:1. count_c is 1, which is less than a and b. So output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aaabbbccc' → runs a:3, b:3, c:3. So count_c is 3, which is equal to a and b. So YES.\n\nWhat about a string like 'aabbaaccc'? No, because runs are a:2, b:2, a:2, c:3. So len(runs) is 4, so invalid.\n\nAnother edge case: empty string? But according to the problem statement, the length is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother test case: 'acb' → runs are a:1, c:1, b:1 → len(runs)=3. But the second run is c, not b. So invalid.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaaccc' is invalid due to runs being more than 3.\n\nWhat about 'aabbcccd'? runs a:2, b:2, c:3, d:1. So len(runs) is 4. Invalid.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nWait, but what about a string that starts with 'a's, then 'b's, but then has some 'a's again?\n\nLike 'aabbaaccc' → runs are a:2, b:2, a:2, c:3. So len(runs) is 4 → invalid.\n\nThus, the code correctly returns NO.\n\nAnother possible edge case: 'abbbc' → runs are a:1, b:3, c:1. count_c is 1, which is equal to a's count. So valid.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let me think about how to write this in Python.\n\nThe code will read the input, process the runs, check the conditions, and output accordingly.\n\nI think that's all.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by a specific sequence of operations involving three friends. The string must be constructed in such a way that it starts with some 'a's, followed by some 'b's, and ends with some 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order of Characters**: The string must be structured such that all 'a's come first, followed by all 'b's, and then all 'c's. This can be verified by splitting the string into runs of consecutive identical characters.\n2. **Count Each Character**: After ensuring the correct order, count the occurrences of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n3. **Validate Counts**: Ensure that there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. Additionally, check if the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef get_runs(s):\n    if not s:\n        return []\n    runs = []\n    current_char = s[0]\n    count = 1\n    for c in s[1:]:\n        if c == current_char:\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            runs.append((current_char, count))\n            current_char = c\n            count = 1\n    runs.append((current_char, count))\n    return runs\n\ns = input().strip()\nruns = get_runs(s)\n\nif len(runs) != 3:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if runs[0][0] != 'a' or runs[1][0] != 'b' or runs[2][0] != 'c':\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        count_a = runs[0][1]\n        count_b = runs[1][1]\n        count_c = runs[2][1]\n        if count_a < 1 or count_b < 1 or count_c < 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        elif count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and processed to extract runs of consecutive characters.\n2. **Generating Runs**: The `get_runs` function splits the string into tuples where each tuple contains a character and its consecutive count.\n3. **Checking Order and Structure**: The runs are checked to ensure they follow the sequence 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n4. **Count Validation**: The counts of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's are validated to meet the problem's requirements, ensuring that the number of 'c's matches either the number of 'a's or 'b's.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks both the structural integrity of the string and the required counts, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal.",
