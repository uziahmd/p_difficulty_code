A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain resources: drink, lime slices, and salt. I need to calculate the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given the available resources.\n\nLet's break down the input variables:\n\n- n: number of friends\n- k: number of bottles of drink\n- l: milliliters per bottle\n- c: number of limes cut into slices\n- d: slices per lime, so total slices are c * d\n- p: grams of salt\n- nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast per friend\n- np: grams of salt needed per toast per friend\n\nEach toast for all friends requires each person to have one slice of lime and their respective drink and salt.\n\nSo, for each toast:\n\n- Total drink needed is n * nl (since each of the n friends needs nl ml)\n- One toast uses one slice per friend, so n slices in total.\n- Salt needed is n * np grams.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says each friend needs nl milliliters and a slice and np grams. So for one toast, all friends together need n * nl ml, n slices, and n * np grams of salt.\n\nYes, that's right.\n\nSo first, let's compute the total available resources.\n\nTotal drink: k * l milliliters.\n\nTotal lime slices: c * d.\n\nTotal salt: p grams.\n\nNow, each toast consumes:\n\ndrink_toast = n * nl\n\nlime_toast = n\n\nsalt_toast = n * np\n\nSo the maximum number of toasts possible is limited by each resource.\n\nCompute how many toasts each resource allows:\n\ntoast_drink = (total_drink) // (n * nl)\n\ntoast_lime = (c * d) // n  # because each toast needs n slices\n\ntoast_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nThen, the actual maximum number of toasts is the minimum of these three values.\n\nBut wait, the sample input shows that sometimes it's divided by 3.\n\nWait, the sample input's note says:\n\nIn the first example, they have 20ml drink, which is enough for 20/(3*3) = 2? No, wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20ml.\n\nEach toast requires n * nl = 3*3=9ml. So 20 /9 is 2 with remainder 2, so 2 toasts.\n\nSimilarly, limes: 10 limes, each gives 8 slices → 80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices → 80/3 is 26.666, so 26 toasts.\n\nSalt: 100 grams. Each toast needs 3 *1=3 grams. 100/3 is 33.333, so 33 toasts.\n\nThen, the maximum possible is the minimum of 2, 26, 33 → 2. So each friend can make 2 toasts.\n\nAh, right, so the maximum number of toasts is the minimum of (drink_toast, lime_toast, salt_toast).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate total_drink = k * l\n\n2. total_lime_slices = c * d\n\n3. total_salt = p\n\n4. For each toast:\n\n   drink_needed = n * nl\n\n   lime_needed = n\n\n   salt_needed = n * np\n\n5. Compute how many toasts each resource can support:\n\n   max_drink = total_drink // drink_needed\n\n   max_lime = total_lime_slices // lime_needed\n\n   max_salt = total_salt // salt_needed\n\n6. The maximum number of toasts is the minimum of these three.\n\n7. But since each toast is per friend, wait no. Because each toast is a round where each friend drinks once. So the total number of toasts is the same as the number of times each friend can toast.\n\nSo yes, the answer is the minimum of those three.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the maximum toasts is 2, which is the drink limiting factor.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute each of the three constraints and take the min.\n\nSo, the code needs to:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nAssign each variable accordingly.\n\nCompute the three maxima.\n\nTake the min.\n\nOutput that as an integer as a string.\n\nWait, the output in the sample is '2', '3', '0' for different test cases.\n\nSo, for each case, we just print the number as a string.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\nWhat if any of the denominators are zero? Well, according to the problem statement, all inputs are positive integers, so no",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Input Parameters**: The input consists of several integers that represent the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, limes cut into slices, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters of drink needed per toast per friend, and grams of salt needed per toast per friend.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**:\n   - Total drink available: Multiply the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle.\n   - Total lime slices available: Multiply the number of limes by the slices per lime.\n   - Total salt available: Given directly as an input.\n\n3. **Determine Resource Requirements per Toast**:\n   - Drink needed per toast: Multiply the number of friends by the milliliters of drink needed per toast.\n   - Lime slices needed per toast: Equal to the number of friends since each friend needs one slice.\n   - Salt needed per toast: Multiply the number of friends by the grams of salt needed per toast.\n\n4. **Compute Maximum Toasts for Each Resource**:\n   - Using integer division, compute how many toasts each resource (drink, lime slices, salt) can support.\n\n5. **Determine the Limiting Resource**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is constrained by the resource that allows the fewest number of toasts. This is found by taking the minimum value from the three computed values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntotal_lime = c * d\ntotal_salt = p\n\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\ntoast_lime = total_lime // n\ntoast_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nmax_toasts = min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt)\n\nprint(max_toasts)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line and split into individual integers representing the given parameters.\n- **Total Resources Calculation**: We compute the total available drink, lime slices, and salt.\n- **Toast Requirements**: For each toast, we calculate how much of each resource is needed collectively by all friends.\n- **Max Toasts Calculation**: Using integer division, we determine how many times each resource can be used before running out.\n- **Limiting Resource**: The smallest number among the three calculated values determines the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring all friends can toast the same number of times without any resource running out prematurely.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by breaking down the problem into manageable steps and using basic arithmetic operations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
