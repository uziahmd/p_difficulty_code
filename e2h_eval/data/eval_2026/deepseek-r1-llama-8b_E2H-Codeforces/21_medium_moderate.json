The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where Neko found some treasure chests and keys, and needs to open as many chests as possible using the keys. The condition is that a key can unlock a chest only if their numbers add up to an odd number. Hmm, right.\n\nLet me think about the problem step by step. So each chest has an a_i value, and each key has a b_j value. To unlock the i-th chest with a key j, a_i + b_j must be odd. That means one of them is even and the other is odd because even + odd = odd.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to do is categorize the chests into two groups: those with even a_i and those with odd a_i. Similarly for the keys, separate them into even and odd counts.\n\nWait, because a key can only be used once, and each chest can be unlocked once. So the maximum number of chests we can open depends on how well the keys match the chests in terms of parity.\n\nLet's say:\n- We have x chests with even a_i.\n- We have y chests with odd a_i.\nSimilarly, for keys:\n- u keys are even.\n- v keys are odd.\n\nThen, to unlock a chest with even a_i, it must be paired with an odd key. Because even + odd = odd. So the number of such chests we can open would be the minimum of x and the number of odd keys available after possibly using some for the other type.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the pairing is based on the sum being odd. So for a chest with even a_i, it needs an odd key. For a chest with odd a_i, it needs an even key.\n\nSo the maximum possible is the sum of:\nmin( number_of_odd_chests, number_of_even_keys ) + min( number_of_even_chests, number_of_odd_keys )\n\nBut wait, that might not be the case. Because perhaps we can't use all the keys for one type and then have leftovers for another. Hmm, maybe not. Let's think again.\n\nWait, let's model it this way:\n\nEach even a_i chest requires an odd key. Each odd a_i chest requires an even key.\n\nSo the total possible is:\n\nthe minimum between (number of even a chests) and (number of odd keys), plus the minimum between (number of odd a chests) and (number of even keys).\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily correct. Because suppose you have more odd keys than even a chests, then you can only use as many as the even a chests. Then the remaining odd keys can't be used for anything else because they're already used. Similarly, any even keys left over can't be used for the odd a chests.\n\nSo the maximum number of chests is the sum of the two minima I mentioned earlier.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because each even a chest takes one odd key, and each odd a chest takes one even key. So the total is the sum of the two minima.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd a_i values.\n2. Count the number of even and odd b_j values.\n3. Calculate the sum of the min of even_a and odd_b plus the min of odd_a and even_b.\n\nWait, no. Because even_a is the count of chests that are even, which require odd keys. So the number of even_a chests is x, and the number of odd_b keys is v. So the possible pairs for these is min(x, v). Similarly, for the odd_a chests (y), they need even_b keys (u), so the possible pairs are min(y, u).\n\nThe total is min(x, v) + min(y, u).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read the a array, count the number of even and odd elements. Let's say even_a and odd_a.\n- Read the b array, count the number of even and odd elements. Let's say even_b and odd_b.\n- Compute the sum as min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n- Output this sum.\n\nThat's straightforward. Let's test it against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput:\n5 4\n9 14 6 2 11\n8 4 7 20\n\nSo a array is [9,14,6,2,11]. Let's see:\n\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd.\n\nEven_a is 3 (14,6,2), odd_a is 2 (9,11).\n\nb array is [8,4,7,20]. All even except 7 which is odd.\n\nSo even_b is 3, odd_b is 1.\n\nSo min(3,1)=1. And min(2,3)=2. Sum is 3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example:\n\n5 1\n2 4 6 8 10\n5\n\na is all even. So even_a=5, odd_a=0.\n\nb is [5], which is odd. So even_b=0, odd_b=1.\n\nSo min(5,1)=1, min(0,0)=0. Total 1.\n\nThird example:\n\n1 4\n10\n20 30 40 50\n\na is 10, which is even. So even_a=1, odd_a=0.\n\nb is all even. So even_b=4, odd_b=0.\n\nSo min(1, 0) is 0, and min(0,4) is 0. Total 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the logic works for the examples.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where all a are even and all b are even: then min(even_a, odd_b)=0, min(odd_a, even_b)=0. So total 0.\n\nAnother case: a has both even and odd, and b has both. But when the number of even_a exceeds the number of odd_b, but the odd_a is less than even_b.\n\nLike even_a=5, odd_a=3; even_b=3, odd_b=2.\n\nThen, min(5,2)=2, min(3,3)=3. Total 5.\n\nWait, 2+3=5. But even_a is 5, but only 2 odd_b, so 2 chests of even_a can be opened, and 3 of odd_a (since 3 <= even_b=3). So yes.\n\nAnother case: even_a=3, even_b=5. So min(3, any odd_b? No, wait in this case, even_a requires odd_b. If even_b is 5 but it's even, then odd_b is zero. So min(3,0)=0. And if odd_a is 0, then total is 0.\n\nSo the logic seems solid.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead a array, count even and odd.\n\nSame for b.\n\nCompute sum of min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nReturn that sum.\n\nSo now, in code.\n\nIn Python:\n\nWe can read the input lines, process each a and b.\n\nFor each a_i, check if it's even or odd. Same for b_j.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_a = 0\nodd_a = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_a += 1\n    else:\n        odd_a += 1\n\neven_b = 0\nodd_b = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_b += 1\n    else:\n        odd_b += 1\n\nres = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\nprint(res)\n\nWait, but wait. What about the constraints? n and m can be up to 1e5. So processing each element is acceptable, as 1e5 is manageable.\n\nYes, this should work.\n\nTesting against the samples:\n\nSample 1:\n\na: 9,14,6,2,11 → even_a=3, odd_a=2.\n\nb:8,4,7,20 → even_b=3, odd_b=1.\n\nSo 3 (from min(3,1)) and 2 (from min(2,3)), total 5? Wait no, wait the sample output is 3.\n\nWait wait, what's wrong here.\n\nWait no, in the first sample:\n\neven_a is 3, odd_b is 1.\n\nmin(3,1) is 1.\n\nmin(odd_a, even_b): odd_a is 2, even_b is 3. So min is 2.\n\nTotal 1+2=3, which matches the sample.\n\nAh, right, I made a mistake earlier in thinking.\n\nYes, so the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: when even_a=3, odd_b=2 → min is 2.\n\nAnd when even_b=3, odd_a=2 → min is 2. Total 4.\n\nBut the code correctly sums these.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nI think this should solve the problem.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. Each key can unlock a chest if their numbers add up to an odd number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - Each chest and key has a number. A key can unlock a chest if their sum is odd, which happens when one is even and the other is odd.\n   - We need to count how many chests have even numbers and how many have odd numbers. Similarly, count how many keys are even and how many are odd.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - Even-numbered chests require odd-numbered keys to unlock.\n   - Odd-numbered chests require even-numbered keys to unlock.\n   - The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum number of suitable key-key pairings for each type of chest.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Count the number of even and odd numbers in the chests and keys.\n   - Compute the maximum number of chests by pairing even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys.\n\n4. **Complexity**:\n   - The solution efficiently processes each element in the input arrays, resulting in a time complexity of O(n + m), which is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_a = 0\nodd_a = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_a += 1\n    else:\n        odd_a += 1\n\neven_b = 0\nodd_b = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_b += 1\n    else:\n        odd_b += 1\n\nres = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\nprint(res)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of chests and keys, followed by the numbers on each chest and key.\n- **Counting Parity**: It counts how many chests have even and odd numbers, and similarly for the keys.\n- **Calculating Maximum Chests**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the sum of the minimum number of suitable key pairs for each type of chest (even and odd).\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the available keys.",
