Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a plane with n infinite line roads. Each road is given by the equation a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0. These roads divide the plane into blocks. The home and university are in some blocks. My goal is to find the minimum number of steps needed to move from home's block to the university's block. A step is moving between blocks that share a non-zero boundary segment.\n\nHmm. So each step can be thought of as crossing a road, but not just any crossing—specifically, moving across a road that separates two adjacent blocks.\n\nWait, no. Because the movement is allowed only if the two blocks share a common border of non-zero length. So, for example, two blocks can be adjacent across an intersection point but not have a shared border if they only meet at that point. So each step must cross a road that has a continuous line segment as a border between two blocks.\n\nSo, how do I model this? It seems like the problem reduces to determining how many roads separate the home and the university, but perhaps not exactly, because some roads might not affect the path.\n\nWait, maybe the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of roads that separate the two points. Because each such road would require crossing, and thus adding one step.\n\nBut wait, no. Because some roads could be redundant or parallel. Or maybe not. Let me think differently.\n\nEach road divides the plane into two half-planes. For a particular point (home or university), each road can be characterized as either being on one side or the other. If the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, then that road contributes to the separation, meaning you have to cross it. So the number of such roads is the number of steps needed.\n\nYes! Because each such road requires crossing, and each crossing is a step. So the minimal steps required are the number of roads that separate the home and the university.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each road, determine whether the home and university are on opposite sides.\n2. Count the number of such roads. That count is the minimal steps.\n\nSo how to check if two points are on opposite sides of a line?\n\nFor a line ax + by + c = 0, the value f(x,y) = ax + by + c tells us which side we are on. If f(hx, hy) and f(ux, uy) have opposite signs, then the two points are on opposite sides of the line.\n\nSo for each road, compute f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c, and f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If f1 and f2 have opposite signs (i.e., their product is negative), then the points are on different sides of the road. So this road is a separator.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- Read home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2).\n- Read n roads, each with a, b, c.\n- For each road, compute f1 and f2.\n- If f1 * f2 < 0, increment the count.\n- Output the count.\n\nThat makes sense. So now, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\nHome: (1, 1)\nUniversity: (-1, -1)\nn=3\nRoads:\n1 0 0 → line x=0\n0 1 0 → line y=0\n1 1 -3 → line x + y -3=0\n\nCompute for each road:\n\nFirst road: x=0.\nf1 = 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1.\nf2 = (-1)*1 + 0*(-1) +0 = -1.\nSo f1*f2 = -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: y=0.\nf1 = 0*1 + 1*1 +0=1.\nf2 =0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0= -1.\nProduct is -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nThird road: x + y -3=0.\nf1=1+1-3= -1.\nf2= -1 -1 -3= -5.\nProduct is positive → same side. So no count.\n\nSo total count is 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nAnother test case: suppose all roads don't separate the two points. Then the count is 0, meaning home and university are in the same block without needing any steps.\n\nWhat about when a road is a_i x + b_i y +c_i=0, but after calculation, the product is zero? Well, the problem states that neither home nor university lie on any road. So we don't have to handle that case.\n\nThus, the approach is solid",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step allows moving between blocks that share a common border segment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The roads are defined by linear equations and divide the plane into regions (blocks). The goal is to find the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block. Each step can only be taken if the two blocks share a common border segment.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each road, check if it separates the home and the university. A road separates them if they lie on opposite sides of the road. This can be determined by evaluating the sign of the expression \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) at both points. If the signs differ, the points are on opposite sides of the road.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Read the coordinates of home and university.\n   - For each road, compute the value of the line equation at both home and university.\n   - Count the number of roads where the signs of these values differ, indicating separation.\n   - The count of such roads gives the minimum steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    x1 = int(input[ptr])\n    y1 = int(input[ptr+1])\n    ptr += 2\n    x2 = int(input[ptr])\n    y2 = int(input[ptr+1])\n    ptr += 2\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    \n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(input[ptr])\n        b = int(input[ptr+1])\n        c = int(input[ptr+2])\n        ptr += 3\n        \n        # Calculate for home\n        f1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        # Calculate for university\n        f2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        \n        if f1 * f2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into respective variables for home and university coordinates, and the roads.\n- **Evaluating Each Road**: For each road, compute the value of the line equation at the home and university coordinates. Check if these values have opposite signs, which indicates the road separates the two points.\n- **Counting Separations**: The number of such separating roads is counted and printed as the result, representing the minimum steps needed.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their regions, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
