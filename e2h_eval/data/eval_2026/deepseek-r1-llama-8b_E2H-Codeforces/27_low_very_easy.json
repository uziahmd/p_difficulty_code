On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a sequence of numbers representing performers holding rods high or low. Tommy wants to choose an interval [l, r] and reverse the subarray from l to r. Then, he wants to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in the new sequence.\n\nHmm. So the task is to find the best interval to reverse such that after reversing, the LNDS is as long as possible.\n\nLet me think about what's required here. For each possible interval [l, r], I need to reverse that part of the array and compute the LNDS of the resulting array. Then, among all these possibilities, I pick the maximum.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2000. So the number of possible intervals is O(n^2), which is 4 million when n=2000. That's manageable because for each interval, I can process it in O(n) time, but if I do that, 4e6 * 2e3 = 8e9 operations—way too much. That won't work; we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to find the optimal interval without checking every single one. Or perhaps, for each possible l and r, compute the effect of reversing on the LNDS.\n\nBut even that seems computationally heavy. So perhaps I need to find a way to precompute certain things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal reversal is such that the reversed subarray itself has a particular structure that contributes to the LNDS. Or perhaps the optimal LNDS is achieved by making the entire array non-decreasing, but that's not always possible.\n\nWait, let's think about the original array. The LNDS can be computed in O(n log n) time using the standard algorithm. But here, since we can reverse any subarray, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is either the original array's LNDS or something better.\n\nWait, no. Because reversing a subarray might create a longer non-decreasing sequence by aligning elements properly. For example, in the first sample input:\n\n1 2 1 2\n\nReversing [2,3] gives 1 1 2 2, whose LNDS is 4. The original's LNDS is 3 (like 1,2,2).\n\nSo the reversal can help.\n\nSo the idea is that for each possible interval [l, r], we reverse the subarray and then compute the LNDS. We need to find the maximum over all such possibilities.\n\nBut computing this for each interval is O(n^3) because for each interval, computing the LNDS is O(n). With n=2000, 2000^3 is 8e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo this approach isn't feasible. We need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe for each possible l and r, determine how the reversal affects the LNDS. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal interval is such that the reversed subarray is entirely non-decreasing, thereby allowing it to contribute fully to the LNDS.\n\nWait, but the LNDS could also be extended by having certain elements before and after the reversed subarray that form a longer chain.\n\nHmm. Another thought: the LNDS can be broken down into parts before l, the reversed subarray, and parts after r. So maybe for each possible l and r, we can compute the maximum possible LNDS by considering the best prefix up to l-1, plus the best suffix from r+1, plus the contribution from the reversed subarray.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps the LNDS after reversal can be at least as good as the original LNDS. So maybe the maximum is either the original LNDS or some improvement via reversal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal reversal is to make a specific segment non-decreasing, which allows a longer chain.\n\nWait, but how do I model this? It's unclear.\n\nAnother angle: The LNDS after reversal is determined by the arrangement of elements. So when you reverse a subarray, certain elements are now in different orders. The LNDS depends on the sequence of elements after this change.\n\nMaybe for each possible reversal, the LNDS can be found by considering the reversed subarray and how it connects with the rest.\n\nBut again, calculating this for all possible reversals is expensive.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the elements are only 1 or 2, perhaps the problem can be simplified.\n\nYes! The elements are either 1 or 2. So the LNDS is essentially the count of 1s followed by 2s, possibly interleaved in a non-decreasing way.\n\nWait, for example, in a sequence like 1,1,2,2, the LNDS is 4. In a sequence like 1,2,1,2, the LNDS is 3",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray of a given sequence. The sequence consists of integers 1 and 2, which simplifies our approach.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We can reverse any subarray of the given sequence. Our goal is to find the reversal that maximizes the LNDS.\n2. **Key Insight**: Since the sequence only contains 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be thought of as the count of consecutive 1s followed by consecutive 2s. This simplifies our task as we can count transitions from 1 to 2 in the sequence.\n3. **Optimal Subarray Reversal**: For each possible subarray, we reverse it and check if this reversal helps in creating a longer non-decreasing sequence. Instead of checking every possible subarray directly, we can compute the effect of each possible subarray reversal on the transitions between 1s and 2s.\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: For each possible start and end of a subarray, we calculate how many 1s are before the subarray, how many 2s are after the subarray, and the number of 1s and 2s within the subarray. This helps us determine the potential contribution of each subarray reversal to the LNDS.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef max_lnds(n, a):\n    # Precompute prefix sums for the count of 1s and 2s\n    prefix_1 = [0] * (n + 1)\n    prefix_2 = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        prefix_1[i] = prefix_1[i-1] + (a[i-1] == 1)\n        prefix_2[i] = prefix_2[i-1] + (a[i-1] == 2)\n    \n    # Precompute suffix sums for the count of 1s and 2s\n    suffix_1 = [0] * (n + 1)\n    suffix_2 = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n        suffix_1[i] = suffix_1[i+1] + (a[i-1] == 1)\n        suffix_2[i] = suffix_2[i+1] + (a[i-1] == 2)\n    \n    max_len = 0\n    for l in range(1, n+1):\n        for r in range(l, n+1):\n            # Count 1s before l and 2s after r\n            ones_before = prefix_1[l-1]\n            twos_after = suffix_2[r+1]\n            \n            # Count 1s and 2s in the subarray\n            total_ones = prefix_1[r-1] - prefix_1[l-1]\n            total_twos = prefix_2[r-1] - prefix_2[l-1]\n            \n            # The number of transitions we can add\n            added = min(total_ones, total_twos)\n            \n            current_max = ones_before + twos_after + added\n            if current_max > max_len:\n                max_len = current_max\n    return max_len\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read().split()\nn = int(input[0])\na = list(map(int, input[1:n+1]))\n\n# Compute and print the result\nprint(max_lnds(n, a))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: We precompute prefix sums for the counts of 1s and 2s up to each index. Similarly, we compute suffix sums from each index to the end of the array.\n2. **Iterate Over Subarrays**: For each possible start (l) and end (r) of a subarray, we calculate the number of 1s before l, 2s after r, and the number of 1s and 2s within the subarray.\n3. **Calculate Potential Contribution**: For each subarray, the potential contribution to the LNDS is determined by the minimum of the count of 1s and 2s within the subarray, plus the counts from the prefix and suffix arrays.\n4. **Determine Maximum LNDS**: By iterating over all possible subarrays, we keep track of the maximum LNDS found.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the maximum possible LNDS after considering all possible subarray reversals, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of n=2000.",
