The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lex smaller than q, and the number of inversions in p is greater than in q. And then output this count modulo a given mod value.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. The constraints are n up to 500, which isn't too bad, but I need an efficient solution. Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, permutations p and q. For each pair (p, q), two conditions must hold:\n1. p is lex smaller than q.\n2. inversion(p) > inversion(q).\n\nI need to count all such pairs.\n\nLet me break it down. The total number of possible pairs is (n!)^2. But I can't iterate through all possible pairs for n=500 since 500! is way too big. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, maybe I can model this with dynamic programming or combinatorics. Let's think about what defines a permutation's lex order and its inversion count.\n\nLex order: p is lex smaller than q if, at the first position where they differ, p has a smaller number than q. So for example, if p = [1,3,2] and q = [1,4,2], p is lex smaller because the second element is 3 < 4.\n\nInversion count: the number of pairs (i,j) where i < j and p[i] > p[j].\n\nHmm. So perhaps I can precompute for each permutation p, the number of permutations q that are lex greater than p and have fewer inversions than p.\n\nBut even that seems difficult since for each p, finding all q's that satisfy both conditions would be O(n! * n!), which is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe we can find a mathematical relationship between the inversion counts and the lex order. Or perhaps find some property that allows us to count the pairs without enumerating all possibilities.\n\nWait, another thought: Since p is lex smaller than q, the first differing element must be smaller in p. So for the first position where p and q differ, say at position k, p[k] < q[k]. All elements before k are equal.\n\nSo maybe, for each possible prefix, we can consider the possible choices for p and q beyond that prefix.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to tie this into the inversion counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this using DP, tracking for each possible state the number of ways to reach it, considering both the lex order and the inversion counts.\n\nWait, maybe we can model this by considering each position step by step, keeping track of certain parameters that allow us to compute the required conditions.\n\nLet me think about the state variables. Perhaps for each position i, and for each possible last element, and some other parameters related to inversion counts and lex order.\n\nHmm. Maybe the state needs to include:\n\n- The current position being considered.\n- The last element chosen for p.\n- The last element chosen for q.\n- The number of inversions in p so far.\n- The number of inversions in q so far.\n\nBut wait, that's a lot of states. With n=500, and each inversion count up to n*(n-1)/2, this might be too much. Because the inversion count can be as high as 249500 for n=500, which is way too big for a DP table.\n\nSo that's not feasible.\n\nAnother approach: Instead of thinking about individual permutations, perhaps find a way to represent the problem in terms of some mathematical properties that can be computed efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that for two permutations p and q, p < q lex-wise, and inv(p) > inv(q). So maybe the problem can be transformed into counting all such pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q, and their inversion numbers are such that inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nWait, but how can I relate the inversion count to the lex order? It's not obvious.\n\nLet me think about the properties of permutations. The inversion count is a measure of how 'out of order' a permutation is. Lex order is more about the structure of the permutation from left to right.\n\nAnother angle: For each possible pair of permutations p and q, p < q in lex order, and inv(p) > inv(q). We need to count all such pairs.\n\nPerhaps we can precompute for each permutation p, the number of q's that are lex greater than p and have inversion count less than p's inversion count.\n\nBut again, for n=500, this approach isn't directly feasible because there are way too many permutations.\n\nAlternative idea: Find that the number of valid pairs (p, q) is equal to the sum over all possible inversion pairs where p is lex smaller than q. But I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the problem by considering all possible pairs of permutations and express the count as a combination of certain terms. But I'm not seeing it immediately.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Enumerate all possible pairs (p, q) where p < q in lex order.\n\n2. For each such pair, check if inv(p) > inv(q), and count it.\n\nBut for n=500, this is impossible because the number of pairs is (n!)^2, which is way beyond computational feasibility.\n\nSo we need a smarter way.\n\nHmm, perhaps inclusion-exclusion or combinatorial mathematics can help here. Let me think about the properties of permutations and their inversion counts.\n\nWait, another thought: For any two permutations p and q, either p is lex smaller than q, p is lex larger, or p equals q. So the total number of pairs is (n!)^2, and for each pair, exactly one of these three cases holds.\n\nBut we are only interested in the case where p < q in lex order and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nWhat's the total number of such pairs?\n\nLet me try to find a mathematical formula for this.\n\nLet’s denote S as the set of all pairs (p, q) where p < q in lex order. Then, among these pairs, we need to count those where inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nSo the answer is the number of (p, q) ∈ S such that inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nHmm. So perhaps I can find a way to compute this count using some combinatorial identities.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into considering the parity of the difference between the inversion counts of p and q.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another idea: For each permutation p, the number of q's that are lex greater than p is equal to the number of permutations that come after p in lex order.\n\nBut how does this relate to inversion counts?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as the sum over all p of the number of q's that are lex greater than p and have inversion count less than p's.\n\nSo, for each p, compute f(p) = number of q's where q > p and inv(q) < inv(p).\n\nThen, the total answer is the sum of f(p) for all p.\n\nBut how do I compute f(p) efficiently for each p?\n\nHmm. Computing f(p) for each p would still be O(n! * something), which is not feasible for n=500.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a symmetry or a clever combinatorial observation that allows us to compute the total without processing each p individually.\n\nAnother approach: Think about the problem in terms of the relative order of p and q, and their inversion counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as follows: the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q (lex) and inv(p) > inv(q). This can be written as the sum over all p < q of [inv(p) > inv(q)].\n\nIs there any way to compute this sum using generating functions or other mathematical tools?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to computing the expected value or some similar measure, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe it's helpful to think about the entire set of pairs (p, q) where p < q. For each such pair, either inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or inv(p) = inv(q). We need to count the pairs where inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nSo the total is equal to the number of such pairs minus the number where inv(p) <= inv(q).\n\nWait, no. Because p < q doesn't necessarily imply anything about their inversion counts. So perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the distribution of inversion counts for permutations in lex order.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can model the problem as a directed acyclic graph, where each node represents a permutation, and edges represent the lex order. Then, the problem reduces to counting the number of edges (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut again, for n=500, this is impractical.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that for each permutation p, the number of q's that are lex greater than p is equal to the number of permutations that come after p in lex order. So for each p, the number of q's such that q > p is (n! - rank(p)), where rank(p) is the number of permutations lex smaller than p.\n\nBut how does this help with the inversion counts?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each permutation p, the number of q's that are lex greater than p and have a lower inversion count can be expressed in terms of the inversion count of p and some other factors.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be transformed into considering the sum over all permutations p, the number of q's > p with inv(q) < inv(p). So the total is sum_{p} g(p), where g(p) is the number of q's > p with inv(q) < inv(p).\n\nBut again, I'm stuck on how to compute this efficiently.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should look for some patterns or mathematical properties.\n\nFor example, consider small n. Let's take n=1: There's only one permutation, so no pairs. Output is 0.\n\nn=2: There are two permutations, [1,2] and [2,1]. The lex order is [1,2] < [2,1]. The inversion counts are 0 and 1. So p is [1,2], q is [2,1]. inv(p)=0 < inv(q)=1. So this pair does not satisfy the condition. Are there any other pairs? No. So output is 0.\n\nWait, no. Wait, p is [1,2], q is [2,1]. Here, p < q in lex order, but inv(p) is 0 < 1. So inv(p) is not greater than inv(q). So no pairs satisfy the condition. So output is 0.\n\nWait, another example: n=3. Let's list all permutations and their inversion counts.\n\nPermutations:\n\n1. [1,2,3]: 0 inversions.\n2. [1,3,2]: 1 inversion.\n3. [2,1,3]: 1 inversion.\n4. [2,3,1]: 2 inversions.\n5. [3,1,2]: 2 inversions.\n6. [3,2,1]: 3 inversions.\n\nNow, for each pair where p < q in lex order:\n\nCompare each p and q where p is lex smaller than q.\n\nLet's see:\n\np1 vs q2: q2 is [1,3,2], which is larger than p1. inv(p1)=0, inv(q2)=1. So inv(p) < inv(q). So not counted.\n\np1 vs q3: [2,1,3]. inv(p1)=0 < inv(q3)=1. Not counted.\n\np1 vs q4: [2,3,1]. inv(p1)=0 < 2. No.\n\np1 vs q5: [3,1,2]. inv(p1)=0 < 2. No.\n\np1 vs q6: [3,2,1]. inv(p1)=0 <3. No.\n\nSo no contribution from p1.\n\np2 vs q3: p2 is [1,3,2], q3 is [2,1,3]. Is p2 < q3? Let's compare.\n\nThe first element is 1 vs 2: 1<2. So yes. So p2 < q3. Now, inv(p2)=1, inv(q3)=1. So 1>1 is false. So not counted.\n\np2 vs q4: p2 is [1,3,2], q4 is [2,3,1]. Compare: first element 1 <2. So p2 < q4. inv(p2)=1 < 2. So no.\n\np2 vs q5: [3,1,2] is q5. p2 is [1,3,2] < q5? Let's see:\n\nCompare elements: 1 vs 3. So p2 is smaller. So yes. inv(p2)=1 <2. So no.\n\np2 vs q6: [3,2,1]. p2 < q6. inv(p2)=1 <3. No.\n\np3 vs q4: p3 is [2,1,3], q4 is [2,3,1]. Compare: first element 2 ==2. Second element 1 <3. So p3 < q4. inv(p3)=1 <2. So no.\n\np3 vs q5: [3,1,2]. Compare first element 2 <3: yes. inv(p3)=1 <2. No.\n\np3 vs q6: [3,2,1]. inv(p3)=1 <3. No.\n\np4 vs q5: p4 is [2,3,1], q5 is [3,1,2]. First element 2 <3: yes. So p4 < q5. inv(p4)=2 <2? No, same. So not counted.\n\np4 vs q6: p4 < q6. inv(p4)=2 <3. No.\n\np5 vs q6: p5 is [3,1,2], q6 is [3,2,1]. Compare first element 3==3. Second element 1 <2: yes. So p5 < q6. inv(p5)=2 <3. No.\n\nSo for n=3, the total is zero. Hmm.\n\nWait, but in the sample input for n=4, the output is 17. So for n=4, the answer is positive.\n\nHmm. So for small n, it's sometimes zero, but for larger n, it's positive.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is zero when n is 1 or 2, but positive otherwise.\n\nBut how to compute it for larger n.\n\nI need a way to model this for general n.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the inversion numbers and lex order as separate criteria, and then finding the number of pairs that meet both.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find that the number of such pairs is equal to the sum over all possible k of the number of pairs where p < q, and inv(p) = k, inv(q) <k.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find that for any two permutations p and q, p < q implies that inv(p) is less than or equal to inv(q) plus some function. But I don't think that's generally true.\n\nWait, perhaps the lex order and inversion counts are independent. That is, knowing that p < q doesn't give any information about their inversion counts. So the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the sum over all pairs (p, q) where p < q of [inv(p) > inv(q)].\n\nIf the inversion counts and lex order are independent, then perhaps the probability that inv(p) > inv(q) is 0.5, assuming all possible inversion counts are equally likely. But I don't think that's the case.\n\nWait, but for n=4, the sample output is 17. Let me compute the total possible pairs.\n\nn=4: 24 permutations. So total possible (p, q) pairs is 24*24=576.\n\nNow, the number of pairs where p < q is C(24, 2) + 24 (since for p=q, p is not less than q). Wait no: p < q is when p comes before q in lex order, so the number of such pairs is (24 choose 2) + 24 (if p=q is allowed). Wait, no: in lex order, p < q includes all pairs where p is lex smaller than q. For p=q, it's not included. So the total number of such pairs is (24! )*(24! -1)/2, but wait no. Wait, the number of ordered pairs where p < q is equal to the number of unordered pairs multiplied by 1 (since for each pair p≠q, either p < q or q < p, but not both). So the total is (24 * 23)/2 = 276.\n\nWait, no, wait: the number of ordered pairs where p < q is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q}, multiplied by 1 for p < q and 1 for q < p, but that's not correct. Wait, no, for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds, except when p=q. So the total number of ordered pairs where p < q is (24! * (24! -1))/2. Wait, no, because for n=4, 24! is way too big. Wait, no: n=4 has 24 permutations. So the number of ordered pairs is 24^2 = 576. Among these, for p != q, exactly half will have p < q and the other half p > q. So the number of pairs where p < q is (576 - 24)/2 + 24 (since when p=q, p < q is false). So that's (552)/2 + 0 = 276.\n\nSo for n=4, the total possible (p, q) pairs where p < q is 276. Out of these, the answer is 17. So 17/276 ≈ 0.06195. So the fraction is roughly 6%.\n\nHmm. So the probability is not 0.5. So the inversion counts are not independent of the lex order.\n\nThus, perhaps the inversion count distribution is dependent on the lex order.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem requires us to find, for each permutation p, the number of q's that are lex greater than p and have a lower inversion count.\n\nBut again, for n=500, this is computationally challenging.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the problem can be solved using dynamic programming, where the state is defined in terms of the current position, the number of inversions so far in p and q, and some information about the lex order.\n\nWait, perhaps for each position i, we can keep track of the number of ways to build p and q up to i, ensuring that p is lex smaller than q and that the inversion counts are appropriately compared.\n\nBut the inversion count is a global property, so it's unclear how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find that the problem can be decomposed based on the first position where p and q differ. Let me think about that.\n\nSuppose that the first position where p and q differ is at position k. So for all positions before k, p[i] = q[i]. At position k, p[k] < q[k]. After that, the rest of the permutation can be arbitrary, as long as p and q are permutations.\n\nSo, for each k, from 1 to n, we can consider all possible values of p[1..k-1], which must equal q[1..k-1], and then for position k, choose p[k] < q[k]. Then, for the remaining positions, the permutations can vary.\n\nBut how does this help with the inversion counts?\n\nHmm. Well, for the inversion count, the choice of p and q up to position k affects the inversion count. So perhaps, for each k, we can model the possible inversion counts up to that point, and then model the inversion counts for the remaining positions.\n\nBut again, the inversion count is a complex function, making this approach challenging.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that the inversion count can be expressed as the sum of contributions from each position. So for each position i, the number of inversions contributed by that position can be considered.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Think about the fact that for any two permutations p and q, p < q implies that in the first differing position, p has a smaller element. How does this affect the inversion counts?\n\nHmm. Let me think about the inversion count in p and q.\n\nSuppose that in the first position where p and q differ, say at position k, p[k] < q[k]. So for all positions i < k, p[i] = q[i]. At position k, p[k] is less than q[k]. \n\nHow does this affect the inversion counts of p and q? Well, for p, the elements before k are all equal to q's elements. At position k, p has a smaller element, so for positions after k, elements in p could create inversions. Similarly for q, since q has a larger element at k, the elements after k may contribute more inversions in q.\n\nWait, perhaps it's possible to model the inversion counts based on the first differing position.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached using generating functions. For each permutation p, we can represent it as a generating function that encodes the number of ways to form p with a certain inversion count. Then, perhaps the product of the generating functions for p and q can be used to find the count of valid pairs.\n\nBut this is quite vague. I'm not sure how to implement this.\n\nHmm. Another Idea: Perhaps the problem can be reduced to counting the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q in lex order and inv(p) > inv(q). \n\nWe can note that this is equivalent to the total number of such pairs minus the number where inv(p) <= inv(q). But I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, perhaps for each pair (p, q), p < q, the probability that inv(p) > inv(q) can be determined, but again, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find that the number of such pairs is equal to the sum over all possible k of the number of pairs where inv(p) = k and inv(q) <k, multiplied by the indicator that p < q.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be solved with combinatorics by considering the inversion numbers and their relations.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that the number of such pairs is equal to the total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q, multiplied by the probability that inv(p) > inv(q), given p < q.\n\nBut how to compute this probability?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by noting that the inversion count of a permutation is a statistic that is not necessarily independent of the lex order.\n\nBut without a clear mathematical relationship, I'm stuck.\n\nHmm. Another Idea: Perhaps the problem can be modeled using linear algebra or matrix exponentiation, but given the time constraints, this seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps for each position, we can model the possible transitions between states, where the states include the current permutation's prefix, the inversion count of p and q so far, and whether p is lex smaller than q.\n\nBut with n=500, this approach is computationally infeasible due to the large state space.\n\nHmm. Perhaps the problem requires a clever combinatorial insight that I'm missing. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, considering that the problem is hard, perhaps it's intended to be solved with a DP approach that considers the inversion counts and lex order in a clever way.\n\nLet me think about the inversion count as a function of the permutation. Each permutation has an inversion count, which is the sum of all pairs i<j where p_i > p_j.\n\nNow, for two permutations p and q, p < q (lex order) and inv(p) > inv(q). We need to count all such pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the problem with a 4-dimensional DP, where the state is (i, j, a, b), representing that up to position i, for p we've chosen a certain number of elements, and for q another. But again, the inversion counts are difficult to model.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be broken down by considering that for each pair (p, q), p < q implies that the first differing element is in p's favor. So perhaps the inversion counts can be compared based on this.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the number of such pairs can be computed using the sum over all possible k of the number of pairs (p, q) where the first differing position is k, p[k] < q[k], and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nIf we can compute this for each k, then summing over k gives the total.\n\nSo, let's try to model this.\n\nFor each k from 1 to n:\n\n1. Choose the common prefix for p and q up to position k-1. So for i < k, p[i] = q[i].\n\n2. For position k, choose p[k] < q[k].\n\n3. For positions after k, p and q can be arbitrary, as long as they form valid permutations.\n\nBut how do the inversion counts come into play?\n\nWell, the inversion count of p is the sum of inversions in the prefix up to k-1, plus the inversions introduced by elements after k, and also the inversions within the elements after k.\n\nSimilarly for q.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can find a way to model the inversion counts.\n\nWait, perhaps for each k, the inversion counts of p and q can be considered as the sum of the inversion counts in the prefix, plus the inversions in the suffix.\n\nSo, for the prefix up to k-1, p and q are identical, so their inversion counts for this part are the same. Let's call this inv_p_prev = inv_q_prev.\n\nFor the suffix starting at k, p and q can be any permutations. Let's denote the inversion counts added by the suffix as inv_p_suffix and inv_q_suffix.\n\nSo, the total inversion count for p is inv_p_prev + inv_p_suffix.\n\nSimilarly for q.\n\nWe need inv_p_prev + inv_p_suffix > inv_q_prev + inv_q_suffix.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as (inv_p_suffix - inv_q_suffix) > (inv_q_prev - inv_p_prev).\n\nBut since inv_p_prev = inv_q_prev (because p and q are the same up to k-1), this simplifies to inv_p_suffix > inv_q_suffix.\n\nSo, the condition is that the suffix of p contributes more inversions than the suffix of q.\n\nInteresting! So, for each k, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to choose the suffixes of p and q such that:\n\n- p[k] < q[k].\n- The suffixes (from k onwards) are permutations of the remaining elements.\n- The inversion count of p's suffix is greater than that of q's suffix.\n\nAnd then, multiply by the number of ways to choose the common prefix and the specific p[k] and q[k].\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each k from 1 to n:\n\n1. Compute the number of ways to choose the common prefix up to k-1, which is the number of ways to arrange the first k-1 elements in a way that p and q have the same prefix.\n\n   For this, the number is equal to the number of ways to split the first k-1 elements into p and q, such that they are identical in the first k-1 positions. Since p and q are permutations, this is equivalent to choosing a subset of size (k-1) from the n elements, but wait, no.\n\n   Wait, actually, for the first k-1 elements to be the same in p and q, the first k-1 elements must be a subset of the n elements, arranged in some order. But p and q have the same arrangement up to k-1, so for each possible common prefix of length k-1, there are 2 possibilities: either p starts with this prefix and q does as well.\n\n   Wait, but the prefix is fixed for both p and q. So, for each possible way to choose the first k-1 elements (they can be any subset, but in some order), the number of ways to have p and q agree on this prefix is 1 for p and 1 for q. So the total number of ways is the number of possible ways to choose the first k-1 elements as a common prefix.\n\n   Wait, no. Because the common prefix is a permutation of the first k-1 elements. So the number of possible common prefixes is (k-1)!.\n\n   Because for each k-1 elements, arranged in some order, that's the common prefix.\n\n   So for each k, the number of common prefixes is (k-1)!.\n\n2. For each such common prefix, the next element p[k] must be less than q[k]. So, for the k-th position, after the common prefix, p[k] is chosen from the remaining elements, and q[k] is chosen from the remaining elements, with p[k] < q[k].\n\n   So, the number of choices for p[k] and q[k] is C(m, 2) * 2, where m is the number of remaining elements after the common prefix.\n\n   Wait, no. Wait, the remaining elements are n - (k-1) elements. So, the number of ways to choose p[k] and q[k] such that p[k] < q[k] is equal to (m choose 2) * 1, because once we choose two distinct elements, we can arrange them in order p[k] < q[k]. So the number is (m * (m-1)) / 2, where m = n - (k-1).\n\n3. After choosing p[k] and q[k], the remaining positions from k+1 to n can be filled in any way, as long as p and q are permutations. So, for the suffixes, the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements is (n - k)! for p and (n - k)! for q. However, the suffixes are independent for p and q, except that the choice of p's suffix and q's suffix affects their inversion counts.\n\n   But the problem is that for each suffix, the inversion count is a certain value, and we need to count the number of pairs where p's suffix inversion count is greater than q's.\n\nSo, for each k, the total contribution is:\n\nnumber_of_common_prefixes * (number_of_ways_to_choose_p_k_and_q_k) * (number_of_pairs_of_suffix_inversion_counts_with_p > q).\n\nBut how to compute the last term.\n\nWait, the suffixes are permutations of the remaining m = n - k elements. For each such permutation, the suffix contributes a certain number of inversions. So, for p's suffix, which is a permutation of m elements, the inversion count is some value s_p. Similarly for q's suffix, s_q. We need s_p > s_q.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to, for each k, compute the number of pairs of suffix permutations (p_suffix, q_suffix) where p_suffix is a permutation of the remaining m elements, q_suffix is a permutation of the same remaining elements, and s_p > s_q.\n\nThen, for each k, the contribution is:\n\n(k-1)! * ( (m choose 2) ) * (number of suffix pairs with s_p > s_q).\n\nWait, because for the k-th position, the number of ways to choose p[k] and q[k] such that p[k] < q[k] is (m choose 2) * 1. Because for the remaining m elements, the number of ordered pairs (a, b) with a < b is (m*(m-1))/2.\n\nWait, no, because p[k] is a single element, and q[k] is another. So for each pair (a, b) where a < b, there are two possibilities: p[k] = a and q[k] = b, or p[k] = b and q[k] = a. But wait, no. Because in our case, p[k] must be less than q[k], so only one of these is allowed. So the number of ways is (m choose 2), because for each pair of distinct elements a and b, exactly one ordering satisfies a < b.\n\nYes, so the number of ways to choose p[k] and q[k] with p[k] < q[k] is (m * (m-1)) / 2.\n\nSo, for each k, the contribution is:\n\nC(k) = (k-1)! * (m * (m-1)/2) * D(m),\n\nwhere D(m) is the number of pairs of permutations (p_suffix, q_suffix) of the remaining m elements, such that s_p > s_q.\n\nSo, the problem now reduces to computing D(m) for each m from 0 to n-1.\n\nWait, but m can be up to n-1, which is 499. So for each m, compute D(m), the number of pairs of permutations of m elements where the inversion count of p is greater than that of q.\n\nBut wait, how to compute D(m)?\n\nLet me think: for each pair of permutations (p, q) of m elements, where p and q are any permutations, what is the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q)?\n\nNote that for each pair, exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or inv(p) = inv(q) holds, except when p = q.\n\nSo, the total number of pairs is m! * m!.\n\nOut of these, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (total_pairs + S)/2, where S is the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) minus the number where inv(p) < inv(q). But since for every pair (p, q), either inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(q) > inv(p), except when p=q.\n\nWait, no. Because for (p, q) and (q, p), inv(p) and inv(q) are swapped. So, for all pairs where p != q, exactly one of the two has inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(q) > inv(p).\n\nSo, for all possible ordered pairs (p, q) where p and q are permutations of m elements, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (T - S)/2, where T is the total number of such pairs, and S is the number of pairs where inv(p) = inv(q).\n\nBecause for each pair (p, q) where p != q, exactly one of the two conditions holds.\n\nSo, T = m! * m! - S, where S is the number of pairs where p = q. So S = m! (since p=q is allowed).\n\nWait, no: T is the total number of ordered pairs, including p=q. So T = m! * m!.\n\nThen, among these, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is (T - S)/2.\n\nBecause for each p != q, exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in the desired set. So the total is (T - S)/2.\n\nBut S is the number of pairs where p = q, which is m! since for each permutation p, q=p is one such pair. So S = m!.\n\nTherefore, D(m) = (m! * m! - m! ) / 2 = (m! (m! - 1 )) / 2.\n\nWait, that's a surprising result. So for any m >= 1, D(m) = (m! (m! - 1 )) / 2.\n\nDoes this hold?\n\nLet me test for m=1: m! =1. So D(1) = (1 * 0)/2=0. Correct, because for m=1, the only permutation is [1], so the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is zero.\n\nFor m=2: m! =2. D(2) = (2 *1)/2=1. Let's see: all possible pairs (p, q) of 2 elements.\n\nPossible permutations are [1,2] and [2,1].\n\nCompute inv(p) and inv(q):\n\np= [1,2], inv=0.\n\np= [2,1], inv=1.\n\nSo the pairs:\n\n([1,2], [1,2]): inv(0) == inv(0): not counted.\n\n([1,2], [2,1]): inv(0) < inv(1): not counted.\n\n([2,1], [1,2]): inv(1) > inv(0): counted.\n\n([2,1], [2,1]): same, not counted.\n\nSo D(2) is 1, which matches the formula.\n\nAnother test: m=3.\n\nD(3) = (6 *5)/2 =15.\n\nTotal pairs: 6*6=36.\n\nS=6 (pairs where p=q).\n\nSo the number of pairs where p != q is 30. Of these, 15 will have inv(p) > inv(q), 15 will have inv(p) < inv(q).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the formula D(m) = (m! * (m! -1 )) / 2 holds.\n\nWow, that's a crucial insight!\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFor each k from 1 to n:\n\n- m = n - k.\n\n- The number of ways to choose the common prefix is (k-1)!.\n\n- The number of ways to choose p[k] and q[k] such that p[k] < q[k] is (m choose 2) = m*(m-1)/2.\n\n- The number of valid suffix pairs is D(m) = (m! * (m! -1 )) /",
