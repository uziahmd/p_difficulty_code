Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the lex smallest sequence of variable values for a golorp based on its name. Hmm, let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, from the description, I gather that each golorp's name defines how variables are consumed. The variables can be 0-9, and the golorp will choose the lex smallest possible sequence. If it's impossible to feed, output false.\n\nWait, the input is a string representing the golorp's name. But what does this name mean in terms of variables? Oh right, the name represents the structure of the golorp's jaws. So the variables are arranged in some way, and each variable corresponds to a digit in a certain position.\n\nI think the key is to model the structure of the golorp's name as a kind of state machine or parser. Each character in the name might represent a choice point where variables are read. The '?' characters probably represent optional choices, meaning that the variable is optional, but in the context of the problem, perhaps they denote a position where a variable can be chosen, and the golorp can choose any value (including 0) to minimize the lex order.\n\nWait, the sample input shows sequences like '0010' and '0250341', etc. So the output is a list of variable assignments that satisfy the structure defined by the golorp's name. Each assignment is a string of digits, and the length depends on the structure.\n\nHmm, perhaps the structure is similar to Befunge's grid, where each row and column is a track, and the path taken through the grid determines which variables are used. Or maybe it's more like a tree structure, where each node represents a decision point, and the variables correspond to the branches taken.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the golorp's name can be thought of as a series of steps where each step may require reading a variable. For example, if the name has a certain pattern, each variable's value is determined by the path taken through the name.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about the exact structure. Maybe I should look for patterns in the examples.\n\nLooking at the first sample input:\n\nThe first input line is a string that starts with '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.' and the output is '0010'. So the lex smallest is 0010. Hmm, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is such that each '?' represents a possible variable position, and the rest are fixed. So the golorp's name is parsed into a set of positions where variables are required, and each variable must be assigned a digit, with the lex smallest combination.\n\nBut that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps the golorp's name defines a series of constraints on the variables. Like, each variable can be considered as a node, and the name defines the dependencies between them.\n\nAnother approach: think of the golorp's name as defining a function that maps each variable to a specific value. But perhaps it's more complex than that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is similar to solving a constraint satisfaction problem where each variable must be assigned a digit, and the constraints are determined by the structure of the golorp's name.\n\nBut I'm not exactly clear on how the name translates into constraints. Let me think differently.\n\nEach golorp has a 'shape' that requires a certain number of variables to be provided in a specific order. The variables can be thought of as being passed into the golorp's system in a particular sequence, and each step may require a variable.\n\nWait, maybe it's like the golorp's name is a series of instructions that determine which variables are needed and in what order. So the first part of the name may represent the initial variables, then perhaps a choice (like a branch) occurs, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the golorp's name represents a tree structure, where each '?' is a node that can have multiple children, each representing a possible variable. But again, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the golorp's name is parsed into a list of tokens, each representing a variable, and the order of these tokens determines the sequence of variable assignments.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the problem as a graph where each node represents a possible state of variable assignments, and edges represent the possible transitions based on the golorp's name.\n\nBut that might get complicated.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is similar to the classic problem of parsing a string into a set of possible options, where each option represents a possible assignment, and we need to find the lex smallest one.\n\nAlternatively, think of the golorp's name as a set of constraints that each variable must be less than or equal to another, or something along those lines. But that seems unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the problem as a series of choices where each choice corresponds to a variable. The '?' in the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values that can be fed to a golorp based on its name. The golorp's name defines the structure of its jaws, which in turn dictates how variables are consumed.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves modeling the golorp's name as a series of constraints where each '?' represents a choice point for a variable. Each variable can take a value from 0 to 9, and the goal is to find the smallest possible sequence of these values that satisfies the structure defined by the golorp's name.\n\n1. **Parse the Input**: The input string is parsed to identify positions where variables are required (denoted by '?') and other characters that may influence the structure.\n2. **Model Constraints**: Each '?' is treated as a position where a variable must be assigned a value. The rest of the characters define the structure, which includes fixed paths and optional branches.\n3. **Generate Possible Values**: For each '?', generate possible values from 0 to 9, ensuring that the sequence adheres to the structure defined by the golorp's name.\n4. **Check Feasibility**: Verify if the generated sequence meets all constraints. If feasible, determine the lexicographically smallest sequence; otherwise, return \"false\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    s = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    stack = []\n    result = []\n    current = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == '?':\n            stack.append(result)\n            result = []\n            current.append(0)\n        elif c == '(':\n            stack.append(current)\n            current = [0]\n        elif c == ')':\n            if len(current) == 0:\n                return 'false'\n            prev = stack.pop()\n            current = prev + current\n        elif c == '>':\n            if len(current) == 0:\n                return 'false'\n            result = current\n            current = []\n        elif c == '<':\n            stack.append(current)\n            current = []\n        elif c == '+':\n            current.append(0)\n        elif c == '-':\n            pass\n        elif c == '_':\n            pass\n        elif c == '*':\n            current = []\n        elif c == '/':\n            current = []\n        elif c == ',':\n            pass\n        else:\n            current.append(0)\n    if len(current) != 0:\n        return 'false'\n    if not result:\n        return 'false'\n    found = False\n    n = len(result)\n    while True:\n        pos = result.index('?')\n        if pos == -1:\n            break\n        found = True\n        break\n    if not found:\n        print(''.join(map(str, result)))\n        return\n    min_str = None\n    from itertools import product\n    digits = [str(i) for i in range(10)]\n    for bits in product(digits, repeat=len(result)):\n        temp = list(bits)\n        valid = True\n        stack_copy = []\n        current_copy = []\n        for c in s:\n            if c == '?':\n                stack_copy.append(temp)\n                temp = []\n                current_copy.append(0)\n            elif c == '(':\n                stack_copy.append(current_copy)\n                current_copy = [0]\n            elif c == ')':\n                if len(current_copy) == 0:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n                prev = stack_copy.pop()\n                current_copy = prev + current_copy\n            elif c == '>':\n                if len(current_copy) == 0:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n                temp = current_copy\n                current_copy = []\n            elif c == '<':\n                stack_copy.append(current_copy)\n                current_copy = []\n            elif c == '+':\n                current_copy.append(0)\n            elif c == '-':\n                pass\n            elif c == '_':\n                pass\n            elif c == '*':\n                current_copy = []\n            elif c == '/':\n                current_copy = []\n            elif c == ',':\n                pass\n            else:\n                current_copy.append(0)\n        if valid and len(current_copy) == 0:\n            candidate = ''.join(temp)\n            if min_str is None or candidate < min_str:\n                min_str = candidate\n    if min_str is None:\n        print('false')\n    else:\n        print(min_str)\n\nmain()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution involves parsing the golorp's name to identify variable positions and constraints. Each '?' is treated as a variable assignment point. The algorithm generates all possible sequences of digits for these variables, ensuring each sequence adheres to the structure defined by the golorp's name. The lexicographically smallest valid sequence is determined and returned, or \"false\" if no valid sequence exists.
