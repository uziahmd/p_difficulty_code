    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about directed graphs and something called p-reachable. Hmm, I need to find two things: the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable graph, and then, among all such minimal graphs, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nLet's break down what a p-reachable graph is. An ordered pair (u, v) is unidirectional if u ≠ v, there's a path from u to v, and no path from v to u. So, for a graph to be p-reachable, it must have exactly p such pairs where u < v and they are reachable in both directions? Wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, the definition says that in a p-reachable graph, there are exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are reachable from each other. Oh right, because u and v being reachable in both directions would imply that (u, v) and (v, u) are both paths, but since u < v, we only count (u, v).\n\nWait, no. Because in the definition, it's about pairs where u < v and they are reachable from each other. So, if u can reach v and v can reach u, then (u, v) is one such pair. But if u can't reach v or vice versa, then it's not counted. So, the p refers to the count of such pairs in the graph.\n\nSo, the task is to construct a directed graph with as few nodes as possible, such that the number of such (u, v) pairs is exactly p. Then, among all such minimal graphs, find the one with the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nHmm. Okay, let's think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, I need to find the minimal number of nodes n such that the number of unordered pairs {u, v} where u < v and u can reach v (and v can reach u?) is exactly p. Or wait, no. Because the definition is about ordered pairs where u < v and they are mutually reachable. So for each such pair (u, v), u can reach v, and v can reach u. So, for each such pair, both (u, v) and (v, u) are paths, but since u < v, only (u, v) counts towards p.\n\nWait, no. The problem says \"there exists a path from u to v, and there are no paths from v to u.\" That's for unidirectional pairs. But for p-reachable, it's about the number of (u, v) where u < v and they are reachable from each other in both directions. So, u can reach v and v can reach u, making them strongly connected, and since u < v, each such pair contributes 1 to p.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So, the p is the number of such ordered pairs where u < v and they form a mutual reachability pair. So, each such pair is a strongly connected component (SCC) of size at least 2, right? Because if u can reach v and v can reach u, then u and v are in the same SCC.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to arranging the graph into SCCs such that the total number of such pairs across all SCCs is exactly p.\n\nBut wait, no. Because for a single SCC of size k, the number of such ordered pairs is C(k, 2) = k*(k-1)/2. Because for every u < v in the SCC, (u, v) is a valid pair contributing to p.\n\nSo, the problem is to find a set of SCCs, each of size at least 2, such that the sum of their C(k_i, 2) equals p. And we need to minimize the total number of nodes, which is the sum of the sizes of these SCCs.\n\nAdditionally, among all such possible configurations, we need to find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs, which are edges that go from one SCC to another, but not the other way around. Because unidirectional pairs are between different components.\n\nWait, no. Unidirectional pairs are (u, v) where u is in one component and v is in another, and there's a path from u to v but not from v to u. So, these are edges that go from one component to another, but not vice versa.\n\nSo, to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs, we need to arrange the components in a way that maximizes the number of such edges between components. How?\n\nHmm. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, find the minimal n for a given p.\n\nI think that the minimal number of nodes is achieved when the SCCs are as large as possible. Because C(k, 2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and then find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Understanding p-reachable Graphs**: A p-reachable graph has exactly `p` ordered pairs `(u, v)` where `u < v` and both can reach each other. This implies that each such pair forms a strongly connected component (SCC) of size at least 2.\n\n2. **Minimal Number of Nodes**: To minimize the number of nodes, we should use the largest possible SCCs. The number of valid pairs in an SCC of size `k` is given by `k*(k-1)/2`. We need to find the combination of these SCCs that sum up to `p`.\n\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: Among all such minimal graphs, we need to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs. This is achieved by arranging the SCCs in a linear order where each component only points to the next, creating a chain of dependencies.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef minimal_nodes(p):\n    if p == 0:\n        return (0, 0)\n    # Find the minimal n such that sum of C(k_i,2) = p\n    max_k = int((2 * p)) + 1\n    for k in range(max_k, 1, -1):\n        remaining = p\n        n = 0\n        while remaining > 0:\n            take = min(remaining, k)\n            n += take\n            remaining -= take\n            if take < k:\n                break\n        if remaining == 0:\n            return (n, 0)\n    # If not found, which shouldn't happen, but just in case\n    return (0, 0)\n\ndef max_unidirectional(n):\n    # To maximize unidirectional edges, arrange components in a line\n    # Each component after the first points to all previous components\n    # So the total is sum_{i=1 to m} i*(m - i + 1)\n    # But wait, let's think differently.\n    # Each component can have edges to all components after it.\n    # The number of edges from component i to j (j > i) is s_i * s_j.\n    # But since it's a DAG, no cycles between components.\n    # Wait, but how are the components arranged?

It iterates over possible SCC sizes to find the optimal combination.\n\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: The function `max_unidirectional` computes the maximum number of unidirectional pairs by considering each component's contribution to the total count based on their arrangement in a linear order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimal structure and maximize the desired properties of the graph.",
