And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. Hmm, let's see what the problem says.\n\nThe input is n and k, where n is the number of days and k is the number of consecutive days considered a week. Then there's a list of n integers representing each day's sleep time. My task is to compute the average over all possible weeks. Oh right, because each week is a window of k days, and there are (n - k + 1) such windows.\n\nWait, how do I approach this efficiently? Let's think about the steps involved.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the sum for each window of k days. Then, sum all those window sums and divide by the number of windows. That gives the average.\n\nBut wait, if n is up to 2e5, then doing this naively with O(n*k) time would be too slow. So I need a more efficient way. Oh right, the sliding window technique!\n\nYes, that's it. The idea is to compute the sum of the first window, then slide through the rest, adding the next element and subtracting the one that's left out each time. This way, each new window's sum can be computed in O(1) time after the initial sum.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Read n and k, then the list a.\n2. Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n3. Add this to a total sum.\n4. For each subsequent window, add a[i+k] and subtract a[i], where i starts from k to n-1. Wait, no, maybe I should iterate from 0 to (n -k), but perhaps starting from 1.\nWait, let me think again. The first window is 0 to k-1. The next is 1 to k, then 2 to k+1, etc., until i + k-1 = n-1. So the number of windows is n -k +1.\n\nSo for each window starting at index s (from 0 to n-k inclusive?), we calculate the sum.\n\nAlternatively, the sliding window can be implemented as follows:\n\n- Compute the sum of the first k elements as current_sum.\n- Add current_sum to the total.\n- Then, for each i from k to n-1 (but wait, that's not right because the window slides by one each time). Wait, no, perhaps the loop should run from 1 to (n-k) times. Because after the initial sum, each step adds the next element and subtracts the previous one.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use a loop that runs for (n -k) times, starting from the first window. Or wait, the number of windows is (n -k +1), so the initial sum is the first window, and then we have (n -k) more windows to process.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Initialize current_sum as the sum of the first k elements.\n- total = current_sum\n- For each i in 1 to (n -k):\n   current_sum += a[i + k -1] - a[i-1]\n   total += current_sum\n- After processing all windows, compute average as total / (n -k +1)\n- Output the average with enough decimal precision.\n\nWait, let's test this logic with the example given.\n\nIn the third sample input:\nn=8, k=2\na = [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n\nThe windows are:\n[1,2] sum 3\n[2,4] sum 6\n[4,100000] sum 100004\n[100000, 123] sum 100123\n[123,456] sum 579\n[456,789] sum 1245\n[789,1] sum 790\n\nSo the sums are: 3,6,100004,100123,579,1245,790. Let's add them all.\n\n3 +6 =9\n+100004 = 100013\n+100123 =200136\n+579=200715\n+1245=201960\n+790=210750.\n\nWait, but the sample output is 28964.2857142857... Hmm, wait, that doesn't match. Oh wait, wait, the third sample's output is 28964.2857142857. Wait, why?\n\nWait the third sample's input is:\n\n8 2\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nSo the windows are:\n\nIndices 0-1: 1+2=3\n1-2: 2+4=6\n2-3:4+100000=100004\n3-4:100000+123=100123\n4-5:123+456=579\n5-",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks, where each week consists of k consecutive days. The goal is to efficiently compute this average using a sliding window technique to handle potentially large input sizes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input:** Read the values of n (number of days) and k (number of days in a week). Then read the list of sleep times for each day.\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation:** Compute the sum of the first window of k days.\n3. **Sliding Window Technique:** Use a sliding window approach to efficiently compute the sum of each subsequent window. For each new window, add the next day's sleep time and subtract the previous day's sleep time. This allows each new window's sum to be computed in constant time.\n4. **Total Sum Calculation:** Keep a running total of all window sums.\n5. **Average Calculation:** Divide the total sum by the number of windows to get the average sleep time per week.\n6. **Precision Handling:** Ensure the result is printed with sufficient precision to meet the problem's requirements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    if k == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n    \n    current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n    total = current_sum\n    for i in range(1, n - k + 1):\n        current_sum += a[i + k - 1] - a[i - 1]\n        total += current_sum\n    \n    average = total / (n - k + 1)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The input is read as a single string split into tokens for easier processing.\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation:** The sum of the first window (first k days) is computed directly.\n3. **Sliding Window Technique:** For each subsequent window, the sum is updated by adding the next day's sleep time and subtracting the previous day's sleep time, ensuring each update is done in constant time.\n4. **Efficiency:** This approach ensures that the solution runs in O(n) time complexity, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 200,000 days.\n5. **Precision Handling:** The result is formatted to ensure it is printed with at least 10 decimal places, meeting the problem's precision requirements.\n\nThis method efficiently handles the problem constraints and provides the correct average sleep time over all possible weeks.",
