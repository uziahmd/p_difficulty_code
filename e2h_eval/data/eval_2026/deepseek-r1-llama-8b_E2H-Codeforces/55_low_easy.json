Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string — the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the lexicographically smallest possible string after performing a series of allowed swaps. The allowed swaps are only between adjacent '0's and '1's, or adjacent '1's and '2's. Hmm.\n\nWait, right. So the rules are that I can swap '0' and '1' if they are next to each other, and similarly swap '1' and '2' if they are next to each other. But I can't swap '0' and '2' directly. So what does this mean for the order of the characters?\n\nLet me think about how these swaps affect the string. Since I can swap '0' and '1', their relative order can be changed as much as possible. Similarly, '1' and '2's can be swapped, so their order can also be changed. But '0's and '2's can't be directly swapped. So, what's the effect on the overall ordering?\n\nOh, wait. Let's see: if a '0' is followed by a '2', but there's a '1' in between, can I somehow rearrange them? Like, maybe through a series of swaps involving '1's. Because '0' can swap with '1', then '1' can swap with '2'. So perhaps the positions of '0's relative to '2's can be adjusted via moving them through '1's.\n\nSo, for example, suppose we have a sequence like 0,1,2. Can I move the 0 to the end? Let's see:\n\nStart with 0 1 2.\n\nSwap 0 and 1 → 1 0 2.\n\nThen swap 0 and 2 (but wait, can I? No, because 0 and 2 can't be swapped directly. But maybe I can move the 2 back. Wait, no. So perhaps 0 can't get past 2 unless there's a way to move the 2 around.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the relative order between 0 and 2 might not be fully flexible. Or maybe it depends on other factors.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the key is to figure out the order in which each character can appear in the final string based on their original positions, considering the allowed swaps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the allowed operations allow certain permutations of the string. Let's model this.\n\nWhat's the effect of the allowed swaps? They let us perform any number of adjacent swaps between 0 and 1, and between 1 and 2. So, for any 0, it can be moved past any number of 1s, either left or right. Similarly, a 2 can be moved past any number of 1s, either left or right. But a 0 cannot pass a 2 without going through a 1, and vice versa.\n\nWait, but if you have a 0 and a 2, and they are separated by some 1s, can the 0 and 2 switch places?\n\nFor example, consider 0 1 1 2. Can the 0 and 2 swap places?\n\nWell, let's see:\n\n0 1 1 2 → swap the last two (1 and 2) → 0 1 2 1.\n\nThen, swap the first two 0 and 1 → 1 0 2 1.\n\nThen, swap the 0 and 2? Well, no, because 0 and 2 can't be swapped directly. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's say I want to move the 0 past the 2. Since they're both on either side of 1s, perhaps I can shift the 2 to the left, but that requires swapping 2 and 1, which is allowed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as being able to arrange the 0s, 1s, and 2s in any order, but with some constraints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the relative order of 0s and 2s can't be changed beyond what's possible by moving through 1s. For instance, if a 0 comes before a 2 in the original string, can I make it come after the 2 by swapping through 1s?\n\nHmm, perhaps it's easier to think of the allowed swaps as creating a graph where edges represent allowed swaps. Then, the connected components determine which characters can be reordered relative to each other.\n\nWait, perhaps that's overcomplicating. Maybe another angle: the allowed swaps are similar to bubble sort steps, but restricted. So, each swap can only change the position of 0 and 1, or 1 and 2.\n\nWait, perhaps the key insight is that all 0s and 1s can be arranged among themselves in any order, as long as the relative order of 0s and 2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing allowed adjacent swaps. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1' or '1' and '2', but not directly between '0' and '2'. \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that while '0's and '2's cannot be directly swapped, they can be moved relative to each other through '1's. This allows us to reorder the string such that all '0's come before '1's, which in turn come before '2's. However, the relative order of '0's and '2's can be adjusted by moving them through '1's.\n\nTo achieve the smallest lexicographical order:\n1. All '0's should appear as early as possible.\n2. Within the '0's, their relative order remains the same as they appear in the original string.\n3. Similarly, all '1's should follow the '0's, maintaining their original relative order.\n4. Finally, all '2's should come last, maintaining their original relative order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we can transform the string into its minimal form by rearranging the characters based on their allowed swaps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    # Separate the string into 0s, 1s, and 2s, preserving their original order within each group\n    zeros = []\n    ones = []\n    twos = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == '0':\n            zeros.append(c)\n        elif c == '1':\n            ones.append(c)\n        else:\n            twos.append(c)\n    \n    # Concatenate the results: 0s + 1s + 2s\n    return ''.join(zeros + ones + twos)\n\n# Read input and output the result\ns = input().strip()\nprint(min_ternary_string(s))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Separation of Characters**: We first separate the characters of the input string into three lists: one for '0's, one for '1's, and one for '2's. This separation maintains the relative order of each character type as they appear in the original string.\n2. **Reconstruction of String**: By concatenating these lists in the order of '0's, followed by '1's, and then '2's, we ensure that the resulting string is the lexicographically smallest possible. This is because '0' is the smallest character, followed by '1', and then '2'.\n\nThis method efficiently transforms the input string into its minimal form with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string, ensuring it handles the upper constraint of up to 10^5 characters efficiently.",
