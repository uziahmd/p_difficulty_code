The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about radio towers in towns. There are n+2 towns, numbered from 0 to n+1. We build a tower in each town 1 to n with probability 1/2, independently. Then, for each built tower, we assign a signal power p (integer from 1 to n). The signal covers all towns c where |c - i| < p, where i is the tower's position.\n\nOur goal is to calculate the probability that after building the towers, it's possible to choose the signal powers such that:\n\n- Towns 0 and n+1 get no signal.\n- Each of the other towns (1 to n) gets exactly one signal.\n\nSo, I need to find the number of subsets S of {1,2,...,n} (representing the built towers) where there's a way to assign p_i to each tower in S such that the coverage is exactly each town once, and towns 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\nThen, the probability is equal to (number of such subsets) / (2^n), since each subset has probability (1/2)^n.\n\nBut wait, how do I count the number of valid subsets S?\n\nHmm, maybe the structure of the valid subsets is similar to certain combinatorial structures, like trees or something else. Let's think about the constraints.\n\nEach town must be covered exactly once. So, for each town j (1<=j<=n), exactly one tower in some i must have i in [j - (p_i -1), j + (p_i -1)]? Or wait, the condition is |c -i| < p_i, so c can be from i - (p_i - 1) to i + (p_i - 1). But also, the towers are only in 1..n.\n\nWait, but for town 0 and n+1, they must not be covered by any tower. So, for each tower i, p_i must be <= min(i, n+1 - i). Because if i is too close to 0 or n+1, then p_i would cover them.\n\nWait, for example, tower 1: if p_1 >=2, then it would cover town 0 (since |0-1|=1 < p=2). So, p_1 can't be 2 or more. So, for tower 1, p must be 1.\n\nSimilarly, for tower n, p_n must be 1, because any higher p would include town n+1.\n\nSo, for towers at the ends, their p is fixed to 1.\n\nWhat about the others?\n\nLet me think about the structure. Maybe the valid subsets form a certain kind of arrangement where each tower's coverage overlaps exactly to form a partition of the towns 1..n.\n\nThis seems similar to the concept of an exact covering, perhaps with overlapping ranges. So, perhaps the valid subsets S correspond to certain binary trees or chains.\n\nWait, another approach: For each town j, let’s denote the tower that covers it as t_j. Then, t_j must be such that j is within (t_j - (p_j -1), t_j + (p_j -1)), but not covered by any other tower.\n\nHmm, but how do the p_j's affect this? It's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node must be covered exactly once, and each node's coverage is a range determined by its position and p.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the valid configuration. The coverage must form a partition into intervals where each interval is covered by exactly one tower, and each town is covered by exactly one tower.\n\nMoreover, the coverage must not extend beyond 0 and n+1.\n\nSo, perhaps the towers' positions and their p's must form a structure where each interval [a, b] is covered by exactly one tower, and the intervals don't overlap except at the endpoints.\n\nWait, but each tower's coverage is a range around it. So, for example, a tower in position i with p_i covers from i - (p_i -1) to i + (p_i -1). So, the coverage is a symmetric interval centered at i.\n\nHmm, but these intervals can overlap. So, arranging them in such a way that every position is covered exactly once, and 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\nWait, perhaps the valid configurations are those where the subset S forms a set of non-overlapping intervals, each covering a consecutive block of towns, and arranged such that their union covers all towns 1..n, with no overlaps.\n\nBut that might not capture all possibilities. For example, in the sample given for n=5, the subset is {2,4,5}, and the p's are 2,1,1. So, the coverage is:\n\n- Tower 2 with p=2 covers 1,2,3.\n- Towers 4 and 5 each cover themselves.\n\nThus, the intervals are [1,3], [4,4], [5,5]. These are non-overlapping and cover all 1..5.\n\nSo, the valid S must form a set where the intervals don't overlap except possibly at the endpoints, and the entire 1..n is covered.\n\nWait, but what about the case where a tower's interval extends beyond the required towns? Like, if a tower is in position 3 and p=3, it would cover 1,2,3,4. So, that could potentially interfere with other towers.\n\nSo, the key is that the coverage intervals must exactly tile the 1..n without any gaps or overlaps beyond what is allowed.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem reduces to finding the number of subsets S such that:\n\n1. All towers in S are at positions i where for any j in S, i is such that p_i can be chosen so that their coverage doesn't include 0 or n+1, and doesn't overlap with other towers' coverage.\n\nWait, but the p_i's are variables we can choose. So, for a given S, can we always assign p_i's to satisfy the conditions?\n\nNot necessarily. So, for a given subset S, we need to check whether it's possible to assign p_i's such that:\n\n- For each i in S, p_i is between 1 and min(i, n+1 -i) (so that 0 and n+1 are not covered).\n\n- The coverage intervals [i - (p_i -1), i + (p_i -1)] for all i in S must exactly cover 1..n without any overlaps or gaps.\n\nSo, for a given S, the assignment of p_i's must satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. The coverage intervals are non-overlapping except at the endpoints.\n\n2. The union of the coverage intervals is exactly 1..n.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be thought of in terms of the maximum and minimum positions.\n\nWait, maybe it's helpful to model this as a chain of towers where each tower's coverage is contained within the previous one's coverage. Or perhaps the coverage intervals form a structure where each next tower's coverage starts right after the previous one ends.\n\nWait, perhaps the valid S is a subset where the towers are arranged in a way that each tower's coverage starts exactly after the previous one ends, and there are no gaps.\n\nSo, for example, if tower 1 is in S, then p_1 must be 1, covering only town 1. Then, the next tower could be at 2 with p=2, covering 1,2,3. Wait, but that would overlap with the first tower. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the towers must form a chain where each next tower starts after the previous one ends plus one. Like, the first tower covers up to position x, the next starts at x+1, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is equivalent to the subset S being a set of points such that when sorted, each point's coverage starts right after the previous coverage ends.\n\nFor example, for S = {2,4,5}, as in the sample, when sorted, 2 covers 1-3, 4 covers 4, 5 covers 5.\n\nSo, the coverage intervals are [1,3], [4,4], [5,5], which are contiguous and non-overlapping.\n\nAnother example: S = {2,5} for n=5. If p_2=2 (covers 1-3), p_5=1 (covers 5). But then town 4 is not covered. So this subset is invalid.\n\nSo, the subset S must be such that when the towers are sorted, their coverage intervals form a partition of 1..n without any gaps.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem reduces to counting the number of ways to select S such that the sorted S's coverage intervals exactly tile 1..n.\n\nSo, now the problem is to find the number of such subsets S.\n\nHmm, but how do we model this mathematically?\n\nI recall that this is similar to the problem of counting the number of ways to arrange dominoes or intervals to cover a line.\n\nWait, perhaps it's related to the Fibonacci sequence. Because in the case where each tower's coverage is a single square (p=1), the problem reduces to tiling a line with squares, which is similar to Fibonacci.\n\nBut in our case, each tower can cover a variable length, depending on p.\n\nWait, perhaps the valid subsets S are exactly those that form a \"domino tiling\" for the line 1..n, but with varying lengths. Or perhaps it's similar to the concept of independent sets in a certain graph.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of valid subsets is equal to the (n)th Fibonacci number.\n\nWait, let's think about small n.\n\nSample input 1: n=2.\n\nPossible subsets:\n\nWe need to have exactly 1..2 covered, with 0 and 3 not covered.\n\nLet's list all subsets:\n\nTotal subsets: 4.\n\nCheck each subset:\n\n1. S = {1}: Can we assign p=1? Yes. Coverage is 1. Town 2 is not covered. So no, because town 2 is uncovered. So this subset is invalid.\n\n2. S={2}: Assign p=1. Coverage is 2. Town 1 is uncovered. Invalid.\n\n3. S={1,2}: Assign p_1=1, p_2=1. Coverage is 1 and 2. So both towns are covered. Also, 0 and 3 are not covered. So this is valid.\n\n4. S={}: No towers. So no coverage. Not valid.\n\nSo, only one subset is valid: {1,2}. So probability is 1/4, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the count is 1 when n=2.\n\nWait, but 1 is the Fibonacci(3) number, as Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, but wait, perhaps I'm getting the indexing wrong.\n\nWait, for n=1:\n\nPossible S: either {1} or empty.\n\nIf S is {1}, then p must be 1. So coverage is 1. Towns 0 and 2 are not covered. So it's valid. So count is 1.\n\nProbability is 1/2.\n\nn=1: count=1.\n\nn=2: count=1.\n\nWait, perhaps the count is the (n)th Fibonacci number minus 1, or something similar.\n\nWait, for n=3.\n\nHow many subsets are valid?\n\nLet's compute.\n\nWe need to cover 1,2,3 exactly.\n\nEach subset S must allow assigning p_i's such that the coverage is exactly 1,2,3.\n\nPossible subsets:\n\nCase 1: S has 3 elements, {1,2,3}.\n\nAssign p_1=1, p_2=1, p_3=1. Coverage is 1,2,3. Valid.\n\nCase 2: S has 2 elements. For example, {2,3}.\n\nAssign p_2=2, p_3=1. Coverage of 2 is 1-3, coverage of 3 is 3. So 1,2,3 covered. Valid.\n\nAnother option: {1,3}. Assign p_1=1, p_3=2. Coverage of 3 is 2-4, but town 4 is n+1, so p_3 can't be 2 because 4 would be covered. So p_3 must be 1. So coverage is 3. So 1 is covered by 1, 2 is not covered. So this subset is invalid.\n\nAnother option: {1,2}.\n\np_1=1, p_2=2. Coverage of 2 is 1-3. So 1,2,3 covered. So valid.\n\nAnother option: {1,2,3} is already considered.\n\nAnother case: S has size 1. Only {2}.\n\np_2=3. Coverage is 1-4, but 4 is n+1, so p_2 can't be 3. So p_2 can be 2, which covers 1-3. Then, town 4 isn't in 1..n, but n is 3. So it's okay. Wait, n=3, so the towns are 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nWait, wait, in the problem statement, the towns are 0 to n+1. So for n=3, the towns are 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nSo, if S is {2}, p_2=2. Coverage is 0..3 (but 0 is not allowed). Wait, no. Wait, |c -2| < p_2. So for p=2, c can be 1 or 2 or 3. So coverage is 1,2,3. But town 0 is not covered. Town 4 is not covered because p=2 doesn't reach 4.\n\nWait, but wait, the coverage is 1,2,3. So all towns 1,2,3 are covered. So S={2}, p=2 is valid. So this subset is valid.\n\nSo, for n=3, S can be:\n\n{1,2,3}: valid.\n\n{2,3}: valid.\n\n{1,2}: valid.\n\n{2}: valid.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nWait, when S is {2}, p=2: coverage is 1,2,3. So yes.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nAre there any other subsets?\n\nFor example, {1,2,3}: yes, valid.\n\n{1,3}: can we assign p's?\n\np_1=1 (covers 1), p_3=1 (covers 3). Then, town 2 is not covered. So invalid.\n\nSo no.\n\nWhat about {2,3}: p_2=2 (covers 1,2,3), p_3=1 (covers 3). Wait, does that cause town 3 to be covered by both? Because 2's coverage is 1-3, and 3's is 3.\n\nSo, town 3 is covered by both. Which violates the condition that each town must be covered exactly once.\n\nAh, right! So that subset is invalid.\n\nOh, I see. So my initial thought was wrong. So in this case, {2,3} is invalid because their coverage overlaps.\n\nSo, for S={2,3}, can we assign p_2=1 and p_3=2? But then, p_2=1 covers 2, and p_3=2 covers 2,3,4. But 4 is beyond n=3. Wait, no, n=3, so 4 is not part of the towns to be covered. So p_3=2 would cover 2 and 3. So town 2 is covered by both towers 2 and 3. That's invalid.\n\nSo, for S={2,3}, any assignment would result in town 2 or 3 being covered multiple times. So this subset is invalid.\n\nSo, what about S={1,2,3}: p_1=1, p_2=1, p_3=1. Coverage is 1,2,3. So yes.\n\nS={1,2}: p_1=1, p_2=2. Coverage is 1,2,3. So yes.\n\nS={2}: p=2: coverage 1,2,3. Yes.\n\nWhat about S={1,3}: can't assign p's correctly. As discussed, town 2 is left uncovered.\n\nAnother possibility: S={1,2,3,4}? Wait, no, n=3, so 4 is beyond the allowed tower positions.\n\nSo, for n=3, the valid subsets are:\n\n- {1,2}: valid.\n\n- {2}: valid.\n\n- {1,2,3}: valid.\n\nWait, wait, what about S={2,3} again? Is there a way to assign p's without overlapping?\n\nNo, because:\n\nIf p_2=1, it covers 2.\n\np_3=1, covers 3.\n\nTown 1 is not covered.\n\nSo, that's invalid.\n\nSo, the valid subsets for n=3 are:\n\n- {1,2}\n\n- {2}\n\n- {1,2,3}\n\nWait, that's three subsets.\n\nWait, wait, but what about S={1,3}?\n\nWe can't cover town 2, so it's invalid.\n\nSo, for n=3, count is 3.\n\nHmm, 3 is the fourth Fibonacci number (if we consider Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3).\n\nSo, for n=1: count=1 = Fib(2)\n\nn=2: count=1 = Fib(3) ?\n\nWait, perhaps the count follows the Fibonacci sequence, but starting at Fib(n+1) or something like that.\n\nWait, for n=1: 1 subset.\n\nn=2: 1 subset.\n\nn=3: 3 subsets.\n\nWait, that doesn't fit the Fibonacci pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me re-calculate.\n\nWait, for n=3:\n\nValid subsets:\n\n- {1,2,3}: valid.\n\n- {1,2}: valid.\n\n- {2}: valid.\n\nAre there any others?\n\nWhat about S={1,3}?\n\nNo, as before, town 2 is uncovered.\n\nWhat about S={2,3}: no, as earlier.\n\nWhat about S={1,2,3, ...} but no, n=3.\n\nSo, only three subsets.\n\nWait, but according to the sample, for n=3, the output is 748683265, which is 1/4 modulo 998244353. So the count is 1/8 * 2 + 1/8 *1 = (2 +1)/8 = 3/8. But wait, the sample says the real answer is 1/4. So wait, I'm confused.\n\nWait, no, wait the sample says for n=3, the answer is 1/4. So the count is (number of valid subsets) / 8.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the total number of subsets is 8, and the valid ones are 2. So 2/8=1/4.\n\nSo, earlier for n=3, I thought the count was 3, but according to the sample, it's 2.\n\nHmm, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, for n=3, let's re-examine the possible subsets.\n\nEach subset S is a subset of {1,2,3}.\n\nWe need to count the subsets S where there exists an assignment of p_i's such that:\n\n- Coverage includes exactly 1,2,3.\n\n- Coverage doesn't include 0 or 4.\n\nLet's consider all subsets:\n\n1. S = {}: no coverage. Invalid.\n\n2. S={1}: p_1 must be 1. Coverage is 1. Towns 2,3 are uncovered. Invalid.\n\n3. S={2}: p_2=2. Coverage is 1,2,3. So yes. This subset is valid.\n\n4. S={3}: p_3 must be 1. Coverage is 3. Towns 1,2 are uncovered. Invalid.\n\n5. S={1,2}: Assign p_1=1, p_2=2. Coverage is 1,2,3. Valid.\n\n6. S={1,3}: Assign p_1=1, p_3=1. Coverage is 1,3. Town 2 is uncovered. Invalid.\n\n7. S={2,3}: Assign p_2=1, p_3=1. Coverage is 2,3. Town 1 is uncovered. Invalid. Assign p_2=2, p_3=1: coverage is 1,2,3 and 3. So town 3 is covered twice. Invalid.\n\n8. S={1,2,3}: Assign p_1=1, p_2=1, p_3=1. Coverage is 1,2,3. Valid.\n\nSo, valid subsets are:\n\n- {2}, {1,2}, {1,2,3}.\n\nThat's three subsets. So why does the sample say the answer is 1/4, implying the count is 2?\n\nWait, the sample says that for n=3, the real answer is 1/4, which is 2/8. So according to that, there are 2 valid subsets.\n\nBut according to my analysis, there are 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the sample note for n=3 says that the answer is 1/4. It explains that there are two cases:\n\n- With probability 1/8, the towers are built in {1,2,3}, and the p's are assigned to 1 for all, which works.\n\n- With probability 1/8, only tower 2 is built, and p=2, which covers all.\n\nSo, the valid subsets are {1,2,3} and {2}.\n\nThus, two subsets.\n\nBut earlier I thought {1,2} is also valid.\n\nWait, what's the issue here?\n\nWait, let's see for subset {1,2}.\n\nIn S={1,2}, p_1=1 (covers 1), p_2=2 (covers 1-3). So, town 1 is covered by both 1 and 2. That's invalid because each town must be covered exactly once.\n\nAh! Oh right, that's a crucial point. So in this case, town 1 is covered by both towers, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, the subset S={1,2} is invalid because the coverage overlaps.\n\nSo, that changes everything.\n\nSo, for n=3, the valid subsets are:\n\n- {2}: valid.\n\n- {1,2,3}: valid.\n\nWait, is {1,2,3} valid?\n\nYes, because p_1=1 (covers 1), p_2=1 (covers 2), p_3=1 (covers 3). No overlaps.\n\nSo, that's two valid subsets.\n\nHence, the count is 2.\n\nSo, for n=3, the count is 2.\n\nSo, what is the pattern here?\n\nLooking back:\n\nn=1: count=1.\n\nn=2: count=1.\n\nn=3: count=2.\n\nHmm, looks like the count is following the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nIndeed, 1,1,2,...\n\nSo, count(n) = count(n-1) + count(n-2).\n\nSo, for n=4, count is 3.\n\nWait, let's test for n=4.\n\nn=4, towns 0,1,2,3,4,5.\n\nWe need to cover 1,2,3,4.\n\nWhat are the valid subsets?\n\nLet's see.\n\nPossible subsets S must be such that the coverage intervals are non-overlapping and cover 1..4 exactly.\n\nLet's try to find all valid S.\n\nOption 1: S={2,4}.\n\np_2=2: covers 1,2,3.\n\np_4=1: covers 4.\n\nSo, coverage is 1-3 and 4. Valid.\n\nOption 2: S={3}.\n\np_3=2: covers 2,3,4. But town 1 is uncovered. So invalid.\n\nWait, p_3 can be 2 only if 1 is not covered. So, no.\n\nWait, p_3 must be at least 1, but can't cover 0.\n\nWait, p_3 can be 2, but that would cover 2,3,4. Then, town 1 is uncovered. So, S={3} is invalid.\n\nAnother option: S={1,3,4}.\n\np_1=1 (covers 1).\n\np_3=2 (covers 2,3,4).\n\np_4=1 (covers 4). But p_3=2 covers 4. So, town 4 is covered twice. Invalid.\n\nSo, not valid.\n\nAnother option: S={2,3}.\n\np_2=2 (covers 1-3).\n\np_3=1 (covers 3). So, town 3 is covered by both 2 and 3. Invalid.\n\nAnother option: S={1,2,4}.\n\np_1=1 (1).\n\np_2=2 (1-3).\n\np_4=1 (4).\n\nCoverage is 1,2-3,4. All covered exactly once. Valid.\n\nSo, this subset is valid.\n\nAnother option: S={1,2,3,4}.\n\np_1=1, p_2=1, p_3=1, p_4=1. Coverage is 1,2,3,4. Valid.\n\nAnother option: S={2,4}.\n\nAs before, valid.\n\nAnother option: S={2,3,4}.\n\np_2=2 (1-3), p_3=1 (3), p_4=1 (4). Town 3 is covered by both 2 and 3. Invalid.\n\nAnother option: S={2,3}.\n\nNo, as before.\n\nAnother option: S={1,2,3,4}.\n\nValid.\n\nAnother option: S={1,3}.\n\np_1=1, p_3=2 (covers 2-4). Town 4 is n+1=5? No, for n=4, n+1=5. So p_3=2 covers 2,3,4. Town 1 is covered by 1, town 2 by 3, town 3 by 3, town 4 by 3. So 1 is covered once, 2-4 covered once. So, valid? Wait, no. Because 1 is covered by 1, 2 by 3, etc. So, S={1,3} is valid.\n\nWait, no, because p_3=2 covers 2,3,4.\n\nSo, 1 is covered by 1, 2 by 3, 3 by 3, 4 by 3.\n\nBut the coverage of 3 includes 4, which is allowed since 4 is within 1..n.\n\nWait, but wait, 4 is included in 3's coverage, but 4 is within 1..n. So, is that a problem?\n\nWait, the problem states that all towns 1..n must be covered exactly once. So, if S={1,3}, then 3's coverage is 2-4. So:\n\nTown 1: covered by 1.\n\nTown 2: covered by 3.\n\nTown 3: covered by 3.\n\nTown 4: covered by 3.\n\nSo, each town is covered exactly once. So, this subset is valid.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought S={1,3} would leave town 2, but no— p_3=2 covers 2-4.\n\nSo, S={1,3} is valid.\n\nWait, but for n=4, the count increases. Let me recount.\n\nSo, for n=4, the valid subsets S are:\n\n1. {2,4}.\n\n2. {1,2,4}.\n\n3. {1,3}.\n\n4. {1,2,3,4}.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n- {2,4}: valid.\n\n- {1,3}: valid.\n\n- {1,2,4}: p_1=1, p_2=2, p_4=1. Coverage is 1, 1-3, 4. So, 1 is covered by both 1 and 2? No, wait p_2=2 covers 1-3. So, town 1 is covered by both 1 and 2. That's invalid.\n\nAh, right, so S={1,2,4} is invalid because town 1 is covered by two towers.\n\nSo, that subset is invalid.\n\nHmm, so I'm getting confused again.\n\nWait, for S={1,3}:\n\np_1=1, p_3=2.\n\nCoverage of 1: 1.\n\nCoverage of 3: 2,3,4.\n\nThus, towns 1,2,3,4 are all covered exactly once. So yes, it's valid.\n\nSo, S={1,3} is valid.\n\nSo, for n=4, the valid subsets are:\n\n- {2,4}.\n\n- {1,3}.\n\n- {1,2,3,4}.\n\nWait, are there more?\n\nWhat about S={2,3}.\n\np_2=1, p_3=2.\n\nCoverage: 2, 2-4.\n\nBut town 2 is covered by both 2 and 3. Invalid.\n\nAnother option: S={1,2,3}.\n\np_1=1, p_2=1, p_3=1.\n\nCoverage: 1,2,3. Town 4 is uncovered. So invalid.\n\nAnother option: S={1,2,4}.\n\nAs before, town 1 is covered by both 1 and 2. Invalid.\n\nAnother option: S={1,4}.\n\np_1=1, p_4=1.\n\nCoverage: 1 and 4. Towns 2,3 are uncovered. Invalid.\n\nAnother option: S={3,4}.\n\np_3=1, p_4=1. Coverage: 3 and 4. Towns 1,2 are uncovered. Invalid.\n\nAnother option: S={1,2,3,4}.\n\np_1=1, p_2=1, p_3=1, p_4=1. Coverage: 1,2,3,4. Valid.\n\nAnother option: S={2,3,4}.\n\np_2=1, p_3=2, p_4=1.\n\nCoverage: 2, 2-4, 4. Town 2 is covered by 2 and 3: invalid.\n\nAnother option: S={1,2,4}.\n\nInvalid.\n\nSo, for n=4, the valid subsets are:\n\n1. {2,4}.\n\n2. {1,3}.\n\n3. {1,2,3,4}.\n\n4. {3}: wait, can we have S={3}?\n\np_3=2: coverage 2-4.\n\nTowns 1 is uncovered. So invalid.\n\nSo, only three subsets.\n\nWait, but according to the Fibonacci pattern, for n=4, count should be 3, which aligns with the above.\n\nSo, the count for n=4 is 3.\n\nSo, the counts for n=1,2,3,4 are 1,1,2,3.\n\nWhich is the Fibonacci sequence starting from 1,1.\n\nSo, the count(n) = Fib(n), where Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for n=1, count is 1; for n=2, 1; for n=3, 2; n=4, 3.\n\nSo, it's matching Fib(n+1), perhaps.\n\nWait, Fib(2) is 1, Fib(3) is 2, Fib(4) is 3.\n\nSo, count(n) = Fib(n+1).\n\nWait, for n=1: Fib(2)=1.\n\nn=2: Fib(3)=2. But earlier, for n=2, count is 1.\n\nHmm, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the count(n) is Fib(n) where Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, etc.\n\nYes, because for n=1, count is 1=Fib(2), n=2, count=1=Fib(2), n=3, count=2=Fib(3), n=4, count=3=Fib(4).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because Fib(2) is 1, Fib(3) is 2, Fib(4) is 3.\n\nSo, the count(n) is Fib(n+1).\n\nBecause for n=1, count is 1=Fib(2); n=2, count 1=Fib(2); wait no.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the count(n) is equal to the (n)th Catalan number or something else, but that seems unlikely.\n\nBut looking at the counts:\n\nn | count(n)\n1 | 1\n2 | 1\n3 | 2\n4 | 3\n\nWhich is the same as the Fibonacci sequence starting from Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3.\n\nSo, count(n) = Fib(n), with Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1.\n\nWait, no, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3.\n\nSo, for n=1: count=1=Fib(1).\n\nn=2: count=1=Fib(2).\n\nn=3: count=2=Fib(3).\n\nn=4: count=3=Fib(4).\n\nYes, so count(n) = Fib(n), where Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1.\n\nSo, the number of valid subsets is Fib(n).\n\nThus, the probability is Fib(n) / 2^n.\n\nWait, but for n=3, the count is 2, which is Fib(3)=2. 2/8=1/4, which matches the sample.\n\nn=2, count=1, 1/4.\n\nn=1: 1/2.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to computing Fib(n), then the probability is Fib(n) / 2^n.\n\nSo, the task is to compute Fib(n) modulo MOD, and compute 2^n modulo MOD, then find (Fib(n) * inv(2^n)) mod MOD, where inv is the modular inverse.\n\nBut wait, the sample input for n=5 is 5/32, which is Fib(5)=5, 5/32.\n\nYes, Fib(5) is 5.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nCompute Fib(n) as per the base cases.\n\nCompute 2^n mod MOD.\n\nCompute Fib(n) multiplied by the modular inverse of 2^n mod MOD.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute Fib(n) efficiently for n up to 2e5.\n\nComputing Fib(n) using matrix exponentiation or fast doubling method is feasible.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Compute Fib(n), where Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(n) = Fib(n-1)+Fib(n-2).\n\n3. Compute 2^n mod MOD.\n\n4. Compute the modular inverse of 2^n mod MOD.\n\n5. Multiply Fib(n) by the inverse and output the result mod MOD.\n\nSo, the code needs to handle n up to 2e5 efficiently.\n\nImplementing fast doubling is the way to go.\n\nLet me outline the code.\n\nFirst, implement a function to compute Fib(n) mod MOD, using fast doubling.\n\nMOD is 998244353.\n\nFast doubling uses the following identities:\n\nfib(2n-1) = fib(n)^2 + fib(n-1)^2\n\nfib(2n) = fib(n) * (2*fib(n-1) + fib(n))\n\nOr alternatively, use the recursive approach with memoization.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, iterative approach may be faster, but for code brevity, fast doubling is better.\n\nLet me write the fast doubling method.\n\nWait, I'll need to implement the fast doubling algorithm to compute Fib(n) mod MOD.\n\nOnce I have Fib(n), compute pow(2, n, MOD), then compute the inverse using Fermat's little theorem since MOD is prime.\n\nSo, the inverse is pow(2, MOD-2, MOD).\n\nWait, but 2^x's inverse is pow(2, MOD-2, MOD) regardless of x.\n\nWait, no. Because 2^k mod MOD has an inverse which is (2^k)^(MOD-2) mod MOD.\n\nBut since 2 and MOD are coprime (MOD is prime and 2 != 0), then 2^k mod MOD has an inverse which is (2^k)^(MOD-2) mod MOD.\n\nBut since 2^k is 2 raised to the k, and 2^k mod MOD can be computed as pow(2, k, MOD), and then the inverse is pow(2, k, MOD) raised to the MOD-2 mod MOD.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCompute inv_2_pow_n = pow(2, n, MOD)\n\ninv_2_pow_n_inv =",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in towns 1 to n, we can set their signal powers such that each town from 1 to n is covered exactly once, while towns 0 and n+1 are not covered by any signal. The probability should be computed modulo 998244353.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be approached by recognizing that the valid configurations of towers form a structure similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, the number of valid configurations (subsets of towns where towers are built) for n towns corresponds to the nth Fibonacci number. This insight allows us to use dynamic programming or matrix exponentiation to efficiently compute the required Fibonacci numbers.\n\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The number of valid configurations for n towns is given by the nth Fibonacci number, where Fib(1) = 1, Fib(2) = 1, and Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2) for n > 2.\n2. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result must be computed modulo 998244353, we use modular exponentiation to compute large powers efficiently.\n3. **Modular Inverse**: To find the probability, we need the modular inverse of 2^n modulo 998244353. This is computed using Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that the inverse of a number a modulo p (where p is prime) is a^(p-2) mod p.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef fib(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return (0, 1)\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b = b, (a + b) % MOD\n    return b\n\nn = int(input())\nfib_n = fib(n)\npow_2 = pow(2, n, MOD)\ninv_pow_2 = pow(pow_2, MOD - 2, MOD)\nresult = (fib_n * inv_pow_2) % MOD\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fibonacci Calculation**: The function `fib(n)` computes the nth Fibonacci number using an iterative approach, which is efficient for large values of n up to 200,000.\n2. **Power Calculation**: We compute 2^n modulo 998244353 using Python's built-in `pow` function with three arguments for efficient modular exponentiation.\n3. **Modular Inverse**: Using Fermat's Little Theorem, the modular inverse of 2^n is computed as (2^n)^(MOD-2) mod MOD.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The final result is obtained by multiplying the nth Fibonacci number with the modular inverse of 2^n, then taking the result modulo 998244353.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the constraints effectively.",
