Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Andrew and Eugene are playing a game with string substitutions. The goal is to process a series of substitution queries on a string and then compute the number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again carefully to understand all the details.\n\nThe problem says that each query is of the form \"di->ti\". For each such query, every occurrence of digit di in the string s is replaced by ti. The order of the queries matters because each one is applied in sequence.\n\nFor example, if the string is '123123' and the first query is \"2→00\", it becomes \"10031003\". Then another query \"3→\" replaces all 3s with empty strings, resulting in \"1212\".\n\nAfter processing all queries, we need to compute the numeric value of the resulting string, ignoring leading zeros unless it's the only digit (like zero), and then find its remainder when divided by 1e9+7.\n\nHmm, how do I model this efficiently?\n\nI think about the approach:\n\n1. **Processing Queries**: Since each query replaces a specific digit, perhaps I can represent the transformations in a way that allows me to compute the final string after applying all substitutions.\n\nWait, but the substitutions happen in a particular order. So for each step, the current state of the string is transformed based on the query.\n\nBut if I model the string as a collection of digits, each substitution could potentially change some parts of the string. However, doing this naively would be O(n * len(s)) per substitution, which might not be efficient for larger cases. But given the constraints, maybe it's manageable.\n\nWait, the initial string length is up to 105, and n is up to 105. So even if each substitution takes O(L) time, with L being the length of the string after each substitution, it's manageable.\n\nSo perhaps the straightforward approach is to process each substitution in order, updating the string each time.\n\nBut wait, substituting di with ti can lead to multiple changes, especially when ti is longer than one character. So, for each query, I need to replace all occurrences of di in the current string with ti.\n\nSo, for example, if the current string is '222', and the query is \"2→0\", the string becomes '000'.\n\nBut how do I handle overlapping replacements? Like, if a substitution creates more instances of di, but since the queries are processed in order, any such changes won't be considered until their respective queries are processed.\n\nWait, no. Because once a substitution is done, the string is updated, and future queries will apply to the new string. So, for example, if the current string is '22', and the first query is \"2→a\", then the string becomes \"aa\". Then a second query \"a→b\" would replace all 'a's, making the string \"bb\".\n\nBut in our problem, each substitution is only for a single digit. So di is always a single character. So during each substitution, we just replace each occurrence of di with ti, regardless of what ti contains.\n\nThus, for each query, we can create a new string by replacing each di in the current string with ti.\n\nBut doing this naively for each query is feasible because the maximum length is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Start with the initial string s.\n- For each query in order:\n   - For each character in the current string, if it's equal to di, replace it with ti.\n   - So, build a new string by iterating through each character in the current string, appending ti if the character is di, else appending the character.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because ti can be a multi-character string. So for each occurrence of di, we add the entire ti string. So, for example, if the current string is '123' and di is '2', ti is '45', then the new string becomes '145'.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for each query, we can loop through each character in the current string and replace it with ti if it's di, else keep it as is.\n\nBut wait, building the new string each time may not be the most efficient way, but given the small constraints, it's acceptable.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. Read the initial string s.\n2. Read n queries.\n3. For each query, parse di and ti.\n4. For the current string, create a new string by replacing each occurrence of di with ti.\n5. After processing all queries, compute the numeric value of the resulting string.\n\nWait, but how do I handle the numeric computation? Because the string can be very long, but mod 1e9+7 can be handled by computing the number modulo MOD as we process the string.\n\nBut wait, the string can have leading zeros, which are to be ignored when computing the number. Except when the string is empty or consists solely of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a series of substitution queries on an initial string of digits and then compute the resulting number modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). Each query replaces all occurrences of a specific digit with a given substring, and these replacements are applied in sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the initial string and the list of substitution queries.\n2. **Process Queries**: For each query, replace every occurrence of the specified digit in the current string with the given substring. This is done by iterating through each character of the current string and building a new string where each digit is replaced if it matches the query digit.\n3. **Compute Result**: After processing all queries, convert the resulting string into a numeric value, ignoring leading zeros unless the result is zero. Compute this value modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    s = input[idx].strip()\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx].strip())\n    idx += 1\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        parts = input[idx].strip().split('->')\n        di = parts[0]\n        ti = parts[1]\n        queries.append((di, ti))\n        idx += 1\n    \n    current_str = s\n    for di, ti in queries:\n        new_str = []\n        for c in current_str:\n            if c == di:\n                new_str.append(ti)\n            else:\n                new_str.append(c)\n        current_str = ''.join(new_str)\n    \n    if not current_str:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Compute the number mod MOD\n    result = 0\n    for c in current_str:\n        result = (result * 10 + int(c)) % MOD\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go and split into lines for easier processing. The initial string and queries are extracted.\n2. **Processing Each Query**: For each query, the current string is updated by replacing each occurrence of the specified digit with the given substring. This is done by iterating through each character of the string and building a new string with the necessary substitutions.\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: If the resulting string is empty, it is treated as zero. The numeric value of the string is computed by iterating through each character and applying modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) at each step to avoid overflow and ensure efficiency.\n\nThis approach ensures that all queries are processed in sequence and efficiently computes the required result while handling edge cases appropriately.",
