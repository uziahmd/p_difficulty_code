Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Vasily has some candles and can make new ones from the stubs. The goal is to calculate the maximum number of hours he can keep the room lit. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nHmm, the problem says that each candle burns for one hour and then goes out. But when you have b stubs, you can make a new candle. So it's like, every time you collect enough stubs, you can create more candles and burn them, which in turn gives more stubs.\n\nLet me think about the example they gave. For 4 candles and b=2: initially, 4 hours. After burning all 4, he has 4 stubs. He can make 2 new candles (since 4//2=2). Burning those gives another 2 hours, but after that, he has 2 stubs. He can make one more candle (2//2=1), which adds another hour. So total is 4+2+1=7.\n\nSo the process is: burn all current candles, add their stubs to a count, then use those to make new candles as much as possible, and repeat until no more can be made.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? It seems like a loop where in each iteration, we take the number of stubs, divide by b to get how many new candles, add that to the total hours, and then the remainder plus the new candles' stubs become the next stub count.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again. Each time you make new candles, you burn them, which gives stubs equal to the number of new candles. So the process is:\n\n- Start with a candles. Burn them all: add a hours.\n- Collect a stubs. Now, make new_candles = a // b.\n- Add new_candles to the total hours.\n- The remaining stubs are a % b + new_candles (since each new candle gives a stub when burned).\n- Repeat this until new_candles is zero.\n\nSo the algorithm would be something like:\n\ntotal = a\ncurrent_stubs = a\n\nwhile True:\n    new_candles = current_stubs // b\n    if new_candles == 0:\n        break\n    total += new_candles\n    current_stubs = (current_stubs % b) + new_candles\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo for the first example, a=4, b=2:\n\ntotal starts at 4.\n\ncurrent_stubs is 4.\n\nnew_candles = 4//2=2. Total becomes 6. current_stubs is 0 + 2=2.\n\nNext iteration: new_candles=2//2=1. total becomes 7. current_stubs is 0 +1=1.\n\nNext: 1//2=0, so loop breaks. Total is 7.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: input 6 3.\n\nInitial total is 6. current_stubs=6.\n\nnew_candles=6//3=2. total=8. current_stubs=0+2=2.\n\nNext: 2//3=0. Loop ends. So output is 8.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the steps are clear. Now, how to implement this in code.\n\nWe'll read a and b from input. Then perform the loop.\n\nWait, but what about when a is 0? Well, according to the constraints, a is at least 1, so we don't have to handle that case.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nWhat if b is 1? Wait, but the problem states that b is at least 2. So no, b can't be 1.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=5.\n\nInitial total is 5.\n\ncurrent_stubs=5. new_candles=1. total becomes 6. current_stubs=0+1=1. Next, can't make any more. So total is 6.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=3.\n\nInitial: 10 hours, 10 stubs.\n\nFirst iteration: 10//3=3, add 3 (total 13). Stubs: 1 (10%3=1) +3=4.\n\nSecond: 4//3=1, add 1 (total 14). Stubs:1 +1=2.\n\nThird: 2//3=0. Done.\n\nTotal 14.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, in Python, the code would look like:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute as per the algorithm.\n\nNow, write this.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\ncurrent = a\nwhile True:\n    new = current // b\n    if new == 0:\n        break\n    total += new\n    current = (current % b) + new\nprint(total)\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFor '4 2', the code computes 7.\n\nFor '6 3', it computes 8.\n\nLooks good.\n\nAnother test case: a=1, b=2.\n\nInitial total=1, current=1.\n\nnew=0, so loop doesn't run. Output is 1.\n\nAnother test: a=5, b=5: output 5+1=6.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using candles. Each candle burns for one hour and then goes out, but Vasily can create new candles from the stubs of burned-out ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`, which will burn for `a` hours.\n2. **Collect Stubs**: After burning all initial candles, collect the stubs. The number of stubs is equal to the number of candles burned.\n3. **Recycle Stubs**: Use the collected stubs to create new candles. For every `b` stubs, a new candle can be made. Each new candle will also produce a stub when burned.\n4. **Repeat**: Continue recycling stubs into new candles until there are not enough stubs left to make another candle. Sum up the total hours from each batch of candles burned.\n\nThe algorithm efficiently calculates the total hours by iterating through the process of burning candles and recycling stubs until no more new candles can be made.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\ncurrent = a\n\nwhile True:\n    new = current // b\n    if new == 0:\n        break\n    total += new\n    current = (current % b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` (initial number of candles) and `b` (number of stubs needed to make a new candle).\n- **Total Hours Calculation**: Start with `total` hours set to `a` because each candle burns for one hour.\n- **Loop Through Recycling**: In each iteration, calculate how many new candles can be made from the current stubs. Add the number of new candles to the total hours. Update the stub count to the remainder of stubs plus the new candles made.\n- **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when no new candles can be made, i.e., when the number of stubs is less than `b`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the number of hours the room is illuminated by efficiently reusing stubs to create new candles.",
