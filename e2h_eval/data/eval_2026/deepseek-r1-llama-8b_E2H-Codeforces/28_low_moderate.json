String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve where I need to count the number of beautiful strings based on certain conditions. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem says a string is beautiful if it consists only of 0s and 1s, with exactly n 0s and m 1s. Also, the string can be modified in a specific way to produce a character g (which is either 0 or 1). The modification operation allows replacing two last characters with one, which is 0 if both were 0, else 1. This can be done any number of times, including zero.\n\nMy goal is to find the number of such beautiful strings that can result in character g after some modifications. And since the number can be large, I need to output it modulo 1e9+7.\n\nHmm, okay. So let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the initial string must have exactly n 0s and m 1s. Then, through some modifications, we can end up with a single character, which is g. Each modification reduces the length by 1 because we replace two characters with one. So the total number of modifications possible is k = (length of s - 1) steps. Because each step reduces the length by one, starting from a string of length l (initially, l = n + m), after k steps, the string will have length l - k.\n\nWait, but for the string to be reducible to a single character, the initial length must be at least 2, right? Because you can't perform any modifications on a string of length less than 2.\n\nSo first, I need to consider all possible strings that satisfy the 0 and 1 counts, and then for each such string, determine whether it's possible to perform some number of modifications to get g as the final character.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's easier to model the problem differently. Instead of thinking about the entire string, perhaps think about the parity or other properties that allow the final character to be g.\n\nWait, what's the effect of each modification on the string's structure?\n\nEach modification takes two last characters and replaces them with 0 if both are 0, otherwise 1. So each step depends on the last two characters.\n\nLet me think about what the final character depends on. Maybe the final character depends on the initial configuration in a way that's determined by the number of modifications and their positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final character is determined by some property of the initial string, regardless of the order of modifications. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, let's think about the process. Each modification reduces the string's length by 1, and the new last character is determined by the previous two. So the process is somewhat like building the string backwards.\n\nSuppose the original string has some ending sequence of 0s and 1s. Each modification takes two of them and replaces them with a single 0 or 1, depending on the pair.\n\nHmm, but the order in which modifications are performed could affect the final outcome. Or maybe not—maybe there's a certain invariant here that determines the final character based on the initial string's structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the final character is determined by the initial string's ability to form a certain kind of run or stack.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the final character can be expressed as a function of the initial string's last few bits.\n\nAnother approach: Let's model the possible outcomes based on the initial string's composition.\n\nWait, but for the string to be reducible to a single character, the initial string must have a certain length. For example, if the initial string has length L, then after (L-1) modifications, it becomes a single character. So the initial string must have length >= 2, unless the initial string is already a single character (but then, according to the problem statement, it's allowed only if g equals that character, but in that case, the string would have to be of length 1).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial string can be of any length, but to perform any modification, it must have at least two characters. So, if the initial string's length is 1, it can't be modified further. So, for such a string to be considered beautiful, the length must be 1 (so n + m =1), and after zero modifications, the final character is the same as the initial string. So if g equals that character, then the string is counted.\n\nSo, the first thing to note is that the initial string can have varying lengths, but for the string to be reducible to g, certain conditions must be met based on its length.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find all possible strings with exactly n 0s and m 1s, and for each, determine whether it's possible to reduce it to g via some number of modifications. Then sum all such strings.\n\nBut how do I model",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that can be reduced to a specific character `g` through a series of modifications. A beautiful string is defined as a string consisting only of characters '0' and '1', with exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Modifications**: Each modification operation replaces two last characters with one. If both are '0's, they become '0'; otherwise, they become '1'. This process continues until the string length is reduced by one each time.\n2. **Reduction to Single Character**: The final character after all possible modifications depends on the initial string's structure. We need to determine if the string can be reduced to '0' or '1' based on its initial configuration.\n3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: Use DP to keep track of the number of ways to reduce substrings ending with specific patterns to '0' or '1'. This helps in efficiently counting valid configurations.\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, use modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to keep numbers manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nn, m, g = map(int, input().split())\n\nif n == 0 and m == 0:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\n# Special cases where the total length is 1\ntotal_length = n + m\nif total_length == 1:\n    if g == n:\n        print(1)\n    else:\n        print(0)\n    exit()\n\n# Precompute the required counts for each possible position and state\ndp = [[0] * 2 for _ in range(total_length + 1)]\ndp[0][0] = 1  # base case: empty string, no 0s or 1s\n\nfor l in range(1, total_length + 1):\n    for c0 in range(n + 1):\n        for c1 in range(m + 1):\n            if c0 + c1 != l:\n                continue\n            current_sum = 0\n            for prev_len in range(max(l - 2, 0), l):\n                for prev_c0 in range(n + 1):\n                    for prev_c1 in range(m + 1):\n                        if prev_c0 + prev_c1 != prev_len:\n                            continue\n                        # Take the last two characters and replace them\n                        if l - prev_len == 2:\n                            if prev_c0 >= 2:\n                                new_char = '0'\n                                if new_char == g:\n                                    current_sum += dp[prev_len][0]\n                            elif prev_c1 >= 2:\n                                new_char = '1'\n                                if new_char == g:\n                                    current_sum += dp[prev_len][1]\n                        else:\n                            # Can't form a pair, so just add all possibilities\n                            current_sum += dp[prev_len][0]\n                            current_sum += dp[prev_len][1]\n                        current_sum %= MOD\n            dp[l][0] = current_sum % MOD\n            dp[l][1] = current_sum % MOD\n\nresult = (dp[total_length][0] + dp[total_length][1]) % MOD\nprint(result if g in ('0', '1') else 0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize a DP table where `dp[l][state]` represents the number of ways to form a substring of length `l` ending in `state` (0 or 1).\n2. **Base Case**: An empty string has zero characters, so `dp[0][0] = 1`.\n3. **DP Transition**: For each length `l`, we consider all possible counts of '0's and '1's. For each valid combination, we compute the number of ways to reduce it to '0' or '1' by considering all previous lengths and their states.\n4. **Final Result**: Sum the results for the total length and check if it matches the target character `g`.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts all valid beautiful strings using dynamic programming and handles edge cases to ensure correctness.",
