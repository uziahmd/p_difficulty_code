His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about an Olympiad where participants' results from two tours are given. But the problem is that the teacher only has the points for each tour, not which participant got which. The teacher knows that Vasya's total (sum of his two scores) is at least x. We need to find the best and worst possible places Vasya could have gotten.\n\nHmm. So, the key here is to figure out all possible ways to pair the a_i and b_j such that one participant gets a certain a, another gets a certain b, etc., but ensuring that exactly one Vasya's a + b is >=x.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the teacher knows that Vasya's sum is at least x. So in reality, there exists some i and j where a_i + b_j >=x. But we don't know which i and j. So, when considering possible pairings, we need to make sure that for the chosen pairing, exactly one person (Vasya) has a sum >=x, but others may have sums less than or equal to that.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya's sum is at least x, but she doesn't know which i and j. So, the way to model this is: among all possible ways to pair the a's and b's (so that each a is paired with exactly one b, no overlaps), find the possible positions of Vasya based on these pairings.\n\nWait, no. Because the a's and b's are given as separate lists, but their order is arbitrary. So for example, the first a1 could be paired with any of the b's.\n\nSo the approach is: consider all possible pairings between the a list and the b list, such that each a is paired with exactly one b, and each b is used exactly once. Then, for each such pairing, compute the sum for each participant (the sum of a_i and b_j for that participant). Then, determine Vasya's position.\n\nBut wait, that's computationally infeasible because n can be up to 105, leading to 105! possible pairings, which is way too big.\n\nSo that approach isn't feasible. We need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nWe need to find the best possible position and the worst possible position that Vasya could have, given that his sum is >=x.\n\nWhat determines the best and worst positions?\n\nIn the best case, Vasya's sum is as high as possible, making him rank as high as possible.\n\nIn the worst case, Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but still >=x), making him rank as low as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the way to go.\n\nSo, to find the best possible position:\n\n- Find the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have, given that his sum is at least x. Then, arrange the pairings such that Vasya's sum is as large as possible, and others are as small as possible, to maximize his rank.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst possible position:\n\n- Find the minimum possible sum that Vasya can have, while being at least x. Then arrange the pairings such that as many participants as possible have a sum higher than or equal to Vasya's sum, thus minimizing his rank.\n\nWait, but how do we model this without considering all possible pairings.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative approach: For each possible pairing, compute the possible ranks of Vasya. But since n is up to 105, enumerating all pairings is impossible. So we need a mathematical approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the best place for Vasya is determined by the maximum sum he can have, given that sum >=x, and then count how many participants could have a sum greater than or equal to this, but in the best scenario, arrange the pairings so that as few as possible have a sum higher than his.\n\nWait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the best possible position is 1 if Vasya can have a sum that's higher than everyone else's. Or is it possible? For example, if in the a and b lists, someone else can't have a sum higher than Vasya's.\n\nWait, perhaps the best possible rank is determined by whether Vasya can have a sum that's higher than all possible pairs. Similarly, the worst rank is determined by how many participants can have a sum that's at least x.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's think about the sample input.\n\nIn the first sample, all a's are 1, all b's are 1. So each participant's sum is 2, which is equal to x=2. So the teacher knows that Vasya's sum is at least 2, which is exactly 2. So in the best case, he can be first, and in the worst case, fifth.\n\nSo the best rank is 1, worst is 5.\n\nSo the best rank depends on whether Vasya can have the maximum possible sum, and whether others can also achieve that sum.\n\nWait, but in the first case, all sums are 2, so he can be first or last.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother approach: for each possible way to pair a and b, Vasya's sum is a_i + b_j, where i and j are the indices of the a and b arrays such that they're paired. But since the a and b arrays are given in arbitrary order, we can permute them in any way.\n\nWait, but the a and b arrays are given, but the order is unknown. So the pairing can be any permutation of the b array.\n\nSo perhaps what matters is the multiset of possible a_i + b_j for each i, but considering that each a and b can be used exactly once.\n\nWait, but that's not the case. Each a must be paired with exactly one b, and each b exactly once.\n\nWait, perhaps the best possible rank for Vasya is when his sum is as high as possible, and others are as low as possible. So to maximize his rank, we want his sum to be as high as possible, and other participants' sums as low as possible.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst possible rank, we want his sum to be as low as possible (but >=x), and as many others as possible have higher sums.\n\nSo, to find the best possible rank:\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible sum s that Vasya can have, such that s >=x. Then, we want to arrange the pairings so that all other participants have sums <=s. But how?\n\nWait, but arranging the pairings is part of our control. So for the best case, we can choose the pairing such that Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and others are as low as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum of (a_i + b_j), where a_i is from the a list, b_j from the b list, but ensuring that all other a's and b's are paired in a way that their sums are as low as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum of all possible a_i + b_j, because we can pair that a_i with that b_j, and then pair the remaining a's and b's in any way, possibly creating the minimal possible sums for others.\n\nWait, but that may not be possible because you have to pair each a and b exactly once.\n\nSo, for the best case, the best possible rank is 1 if Vasya can have the maximum possible sum, which is the maximum possible a_i + b_j.\n\nWait, but that might not always be the case.\n\nWait, for example, suppose a = [3, 1], b = [4, 2]. x is 5.\n\nPossible pairings:\n\nOption 1: pair 3 with 4 (sum 7), 1 with 2 (sum 3). Vasya's sum is 7, which is max. So best rank is 1.\n\nOption 2: pair 3 with 2 (sum 5), 1 with 4 (sum 5). Now, Vasya could be either of those two, so best rank is 1, but if he chooses to take 5, then someone else has 5 as well. So he can be first, but others can have same sum.\n\nSo in this case, the best rank is 1.\n\nWait, but in some cases, perhaps Vasya's sum cannot be the maximum possible. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's think of another example.\n\nSuppose a = [5, 1], b = [5, 1]. x=6.\n\nPossible pairings:\n\nCase 1: pair 5+5=10, 1+1=2. Vasya's sum is 10, which is maximum. Best rank 1.\n\nCase 2: pair 5+1=6, 1+5=6. Both have sum 6. So Vasya's sum is 6, but others also have 6. So best rank is 1, because the jury can decide the order, placing him first.\n\nSo regardless of how you pair, the maximum sum is 10 or 6, depending on pairing. But wait, in case 1, the maximum sum is 10, which is higher than 6. So in that case, the best rank is 1.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, we can arrange the pairings such that Vasya has the maximum possible sum.\n\nThus, the best possible rank is 1 if there exists a way to pair the a and b such that Vasya's sum is the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Let's see.\n\nWait, suppose a = [3, 3], b = [3, 3], x=6.\n\nIf we pair 3+3=6 for both, then Vasya's sum is 6, same as others. So best rank is 1, but worst is 2.\n\nBut in another pairing, say, 3+3=6 and 3+3=6, same thing. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, but in any case, Vasya's sum is 6, but others also have 6. So he can be placed first.\n\nSo yes, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo perhaps the best possible rank is 1 as long as Vasya's sum is >=x, but what if there are other constraints?\n\nWait, perhaps not always. Let's think of a scenario where Vasya's sum can't be the maximum.\n\nWait, for example, a = [4, 1], b = [4, 1], x=5.\n\nSuppose Vasya's sum is 5, which is the minimum required. If we pair 4 with 1, sum is 5, and 1 with 4, sum is 5. So all participants have sum 5. So the best rank is 1.\n\nWait, but what if a = [5, 0], b = [5, 0], x=5.\n\nThen, possible pairings:\n\nEither 5+5=10, 0+0=0. So Vasya's sum is 10, which is maximum. So best rank is 1.\n\nAlternatively, 5+0=5 and 0+5=5. Vasya's sum is 5, same as others. So best rank is 1.\n\nSo yeah, in all cases, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the best possible rank is always 1.\n\nWait, no. Because what if the a and b are such that no matter how you pair, someone else has a sum higher than Vasya's.\n\nWait, let's imagine a scenario where a = [2, 2], b = [3, 1], x=4.\n\nSo possible pairings:\n\nPair 2+3=5, 2+1=3. Then, the sums are 5 and 3. So Vasya's sum could be 5 (best rank 1), or 3 (but then x=4 is not met, so it's invalid).\n\nWait, but in this case, if Vasya's sum is 5, which is the maximum, then best rank is 1.\n\nAnother pairing: 2+1=3, 2+3=5. Same as before.\n\nWhat if the a and b are [3, 1] and [2, 2].\n\nSame thing.\n\nWait, but what if a = [3, 1], b = [3, 1], x=4.\n\nThen, Vasya's sum could be 4 (3+1), but other pairings could give 4 as well.\n\nSo in that case, the best rank is 1 because the jury can arrange the order to have him first.\n\nSo I'm starting to think that for the best possible rank, it's always possible for Vasya to have the maximum sum, hence best rank is 1.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Let's think of a case where it's impossible.\n\nWait, suppose a = [5, 0], b = [5, 0], x=5.\n\nIn any pairing, the maximum possible sum is 10. So Vasya can have 10, making him first.\n\nAnother example: a = [5, 5], b = [5, 5]. So all pairings give sum 10. So best rank is 1.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the best possible rank is always 1, as long as Vasya's sum is >=x.\n\nWait, but what about the following scenario:\n\na = [4, 1], b = [3, 2], x=5.\n\nPossible pairings:\n\nCase 1: 4+3=7, 1+2=3. Vasya's sum is 7, which is the maximum. So best rank is 1.\n\nCase 2: 4+2=6, 1+3=4. Vasya's sum is 6, which is the maximum. So best rank is 1.\n\nCase 3: 1+3=4, 4+2=6. Vasya's sum is 6, again maximum.\n\nSo yes, best rank is 1.\n\nWait, but what if the a and b are such that no pairing can have a sum higher than Vasya's.\n\nWait, but Vasya's sum is fixed as a_i + b_j. So if there exists a pairing where someone else's sum is higher than Vasya's, then in that pairing, Vasya's rank would be worse.\n\nBut for the best possible rank, we can choose the pairing where Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and others' sums are as low as possible.\n\nSo perhaps the best possible rank is 1, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let me think about the worst possible rank.\n\nFor the worst possible rank, we need to minimize Vasya's rank. That is, we want as many participants as possible to have a sum >= Vasya's sum.\n\nTo do this, we need to pair the a and b in such a way that as many participants as possible have a sum >=x, and Vasya's sum is the smallest possible >=x.\n\nSo the worst possible rank would be the number of participants whose sum is >= Vasya's sum plus one.\n\nWait, but how to find the minimal number of participants who can have a sum >=x.\n\nWait, perhaps the worst possible rank is the minimal number of participants who have a sum >=x, plus one.\n\nWait, no. Because in the worst case, as many participants as possible have a sum >=x, including Vasya.\n\nSo the worst rank is the number of participants who have sum >=x, and Vasya is the lowest among them.\n\nWait, but how to model this.\n\nIdea: For the worst possible rank, we need to find the minimal possible number of participants that have a sum >=x, which would imply the worst rank is as small as possible. Wait, no. Wait, the worst rank is when Vasya's rank is as bad as possible. So if more participants have sum >=x, then Vasya's rank is worse.\n\nWait, perhaps the worst possible rank is the number of participants who have sum >=x, and Vasya is the one with the minimal sum in that group.\n\nSo to find the worst possible rank, we need to find the minimal possible number of participants that can have sum >=x, but that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst possible rank is the number of participants that can have a sum >=x, minus the maximum possible number of participants that can have a sum <x.\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternative approach: To find the worst possible rank, we need to maximize the number of participants with sum >=x. So the worst rank is the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=x, and Vasya is one of them with the minimal sum in that group.\n\nSo, for the worst rank, we want as many participants as possible to have sum >=x, while Vasya's sum is as small as possible, but still >=x.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. For the worst case, find the minimal possible sum S that Vasya can have, such that S >=x.\n\n2. Then, find the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= S.\n\nBecause in the worst case, all those participants with sum >= S will be ranked above Vasya, making his rank as bad as possible.\n\nSo, how to find S?\n\nS is the minimal sum that Vasya can have, but >=x.\n\nWait, but S is determined by the pairings.\n\nSo, to find S, we can try all possible pairings, find the minimal sum S for which there exists a pairing where exactly one participant (Vasya) has sum >=x, and others have sum <=S.\n\nWait, but this seems computationally intensive.\n\nAlternative idea: For the worst case, S is the minimal possible sum that is >=x, and the maximum number of participants can have sum >=S.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal possible S is x, but that's not always possible.\n\nWait, let's think of the sample input:\n\nn=5, x=2.\n\na = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nb = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nAll pairings give sum 2. So S is 2.\n\nThe number of participants with sum >=2 is 5. So worst rank is 5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=3, x=3.\n\na = [2, 2, 2]\n\nb = [1, 1, 1]\n\nPossible pairings:\n\nEach a is 2, each b is 1. Sum is 3.\n\nSo in all pairings, all participants have sum 3. So worst rank is 3.\n\nBut wait, Vasya's sum is 3, so all participants have sum >=3, so Vasya's rank is 3.\n\nBut what if x is 4.\n\nIn that case, a = [2,2,2], b = [1,1,1]. No sum can be >=4. But the problem says that it's guaranteed that there exists i,j such that a_i +b_j >=x. So in our case, x can't be 4 in this example.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's given that \"it is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad\", but nothing about the sum. So the code must handle cases where x is possible.\n\nSo back to the problem.\n\nTo find the worst possible rank, we need to find the minimal possible sum S that is >=x, such that the maximum number of participants can have sum >=S.\n\nWait, perhaps S is the minimal possible sum that is >=x, and the maximum number of participants can have sum >=S.\n\nWait, but how to find S and the maximum number of participants.\n\nAlternatively, the worst possible rank is the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=x, given that Vasya's sum is the minimal possible (>=x).\n\nSo, for each possible way to pair the a and b, the worst rank is the number of participants with sum >=x, and Vasya is one of them with the smallest sum.\n\nSo, to find the worst possible rank, we need to find the minimal possible sum S >=x, and then compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=S.\n\nWait, perhaps the worst possible rank is the maximum possible number of participants that can have sum >=x, given that Vasya's sum is S >=x.\n\nSo, how to model this.\n\nPerhaps, for the worst case, we need to select a pairing where as many participants as possible have sum >=x, and Vasya's sum is as small as possible (but >=x).\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor the worst case:\n\n1. Find all possible ways to pair a and b, such that exactly one participant (Vasya) has sum >=x, and others have sum <=x. But wait, that's not possible because Vasya's sum is >=x, but others can have sum >=x as well.\n\nWait, no. Because in the worst case, others can also have sum >=x, making Vasya's rank lower.\n\nSo the approach is: find the minimal possible sum S that is >=x, such that as many participants as possible can have sum >=S.\n\nWait, perhaps the worst possible rank is the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= S, where S is the minimal possible sum >=x that can be achieved by any pairing.\n\nWait, perhaps S is the minimal possible sum that is >=x, and the maximum number of participants can have sum >= S.\n\nHmm.\n\nThis seems a bit abstract. Maybe I should think of it as:\n\nThe worst possible rank is the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=x, given that Vasya's sum is S >=x.\n\nSo, to find S, we can try to find the minimal possible sum that is >=x, such that after pairing, as many participants as possible have sum >=x.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal S is the minimal sum that can be achieved for a participant in any pairing, but >=x.\n\nWait, perhaps S is the minimal sum that is >=x, and can be achieved by at least one participant in the pairing.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the worst case, the maximum number of participants with sum >=x is the maximum possible over all possible pairings, and Vasya's sum is the minimal among them.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nMaybe the worst case is when Vasya's sum is as small as possible (but >=x), and as many others as possible have sum >=x.\n\nSo, to find the worst case, we need to find the minimal possible S >=x, and then find the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= S.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For the best case:\n\n   - Find the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have, given that his sum is >=x. Then, arrange the pairings such that this sum is the maximum possible, and others are as small as possible. Thus, Vasya's rank is 1.\n\n   So, the best possible rank is 1.\n\n2. For the worst case:\n\n   - Find the minimal possible sum S that Vasya can have, which is >=x. Then, arrange the pairings such that as many participants as possible have sum >=S. The worst rank is the number of such participants.\n\nSo, the best rank is always 1, as long as there exists a way to pair a and b such that Vasya's sum is the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but is that always possible?\n\nLet me think.\n\nYes. Because in the best case, we can pair the a and b to get the maximum possible sum for Vasya. Since the a and b are given, the maximum possible sum for any participant is the maximum of a_i + b_j. So, we can choose to pair a_i (the a that gives the maximum sum) with b_j (the b that gives the maximum sum) to get the maximum possible sum for Vasya. Then, pair the rest in a way that their sums are as small as possible. So, Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, and others are as small as possible, making his rank 1.\n\nTherefore, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nNow, the worst possible rank is trickier.\n\nWe need to find the minimal possible sum S >=x that Vasya can have, and then arrange the pairings so that as many participants as possible have sum >= S.\n\nSo, for the worst case, S is the minimal sum that can be achieved for Vasya in any pairing, such that S >=x.\n\nOnce S is determined, we can find how many participants can have sum >=S.\n\nWait, but how to find S.\n\nS is the minimal sum that Vasya can have, which is >=x, and is achievable through some pairing.\n\nSo, for the worst case:\n\nWe need to find the minimal possible sum S >=x, and then find the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= S in any pairing.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal S is x, but it's possible that no pairing allows Vasya to have sum x.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nFind all possible a_i and b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nThen, find the minimal possible sum S that can be assigned to Vasya, which is the minimal a_i + b_j where a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nWait, no. Because Vasya's sum is a_i + b_j, but the pairing is such that exactly one participant is Vasya, and others are assigned the remaining a and b.\n\nSo, the minimal S is the minimal possible sum that can be achieved by any participant in the pairing, which is >=x.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nWait, the worst case is when Vasya's sum is as small as possible (but >=x), and as many others as possible have sum >= S.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFind the minimal possible S >=x, such that there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is S, and the maximum number of participants can have sum >= S.\n\nSo, the steps for worst case:\n\n1. Find all possible a_i and b_j that can form a sum >=x.\n\n   For each such (a_i, b_j), compute S_candidate = a_i + b_j.\n\n   Then, for each S_candidate, check if it's possible to pair the remaining a's and b's such that the maximum number of participants have sum >= S_candidate.\n\nBut this seems computationally expensive.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nFor the worst case, the minimal possible S is the minimal possible sum that can be achieved by any participant in any pairing, and S >=x.\n\nWait, but that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal S is x, but it's possible that no pairing allows Vasya to have sum x.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal S is the minimal sum >=x that can be formed by any a_i + b_j.\n\nOnce S is found, we can compute how many participants can have sum >= S in any pairing.\n\nWait, but how.\n\nAn alternative approach is to find for the worst case:\n\nWe need to find the minimal possible sum S >=x, and then find the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=S in any pairing.\n\nSo, the worst case rank is the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=S, where S is the minimal possible sum >=x.\n\nWait, but how to find S.\n\nLet me think of an algorithm.\n\nWe can proceed as follows:\n\nFor the worst case:\n\n1. Enumerate all possible a_i and b_j, compute their sum s = a_i + b_j.\n\n   Collect all s where s >=x.\n\n   Let min_s be the minimal such s.\n\n   This min_s is the minimal possible sum that Vasya can have in the worst case.\n\n   Because in the worst case, we can arrange for Vasya to have the minimal possible sum that is >=x.\n\n2. Once min_s is found, we need to find the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= min_s in any pairing.\n\nSo, the worst rank is that number.\n\nWait, but how to compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= min_s.\n\nThis requires that in the pairing, as many participants as possible have sum >= min_s.\n\nBut how to arrange the pairings to achieve this.\n\nSo, for each possible pairing, compute the number of participants with sum >= min_s, and find the maximum such number.\n\nBut since n can be up to 105, enumerating all possible pairings is impossible.\n\nThus, we need a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= min_s is the maximum between the number of a_i's >= min_s - b_j's, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= min_s is the maximum possible, given that in the pairing, each a_i is paired with a b_j such that a_i + b_j >= min_s.\n\nSo, the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= min_s is the maximum number of a_i's and b_j's that can be paired together such that their sum is >= min_s.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= min_s is the maximum matching between a and b where a_i + b_j >= min_s.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nWait, let me think differently.\n\nWe can model this as a bipartite graph, where one partition is the a list, the other is the b list.\n\nAn edge exists between a_i and b_j if a_i + b_j >= min_s.\n\nWe need to find the maximum matching in this bipartite graph.\n\nThe size of the maximum matching will give us the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= min_s.\n\nWait, that makes sense.\n\nBecause each matched a_i and b_j forms a participant with sum >= min_s.\n\nSo, the maximum number of participants is the maximum matching in this bipartite graph.\n\nThus, the steps for the worst case are:\n\n1. Find the minimal possible sum S >=x that Vasya can have in any pairing. That is, S is the minimal sum that can be formed by a_i + b_j, where a_i is in a, b_j is in b, and a_i + b_j >=x.\n\n   So, S = min{a_i + b_j | a_i in a, b_j in b, a_i + b_j >=x}.\n\n2. Compute the maximum matching between a and b where a_i + b_j >= S.\n\n   The size of this matching is the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= S.\n\n   Thus, the worst rank is this size.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nCompute best_rank = 1.\n\nCompute S_min = min{a_i + b_j | a_i in a, b_j in b, a_i + b_j >=x}.\n\nCompute the maximum matching size M where a_i + b_j >= S_min.\n\nWorst_rank = M.\n\nBut wait, because in the pairing, each a and b can be used exactly once.\n\nThus, the maximum number of participants with sum >= S_min is the maximum number of edges in the bipartite graph where a_i + b_j >= S_min, and each a and b is used exactly once.\n\nWhich is exactly the maximum matching.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCompute S_min as the minimal sum >=x.\n\nCompute the maximum bipartite matching where a_i + b_j >= S_min.\n\nThe size of this matching is the worst rank.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to:\n\n- Compute S_min.\n\n- Compute maximum bipartite matching where a_i + b_j >= S_min.\n\nNow, let's see.\n\nSo, for the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5 2\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nSo, S_min is 2.\n\nMaximum matching is 5, since all a_i + b_j =2 >=2.\n\nSo, worst rank is 5.\n\nSample Output: 1 5.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n6 7\n\n4 3 5 6 4 4\n\n8 6 0 4 3 4\n\nCompute S_min:\n\nWe need to find the minimal sum >=7.\n\nLooking for a_i + b_j >=7.\n\nLooking for the minimal such sum.\n\nLooking at a and b:\n\na is [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n\nb is [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n4+8=12 (sum 12)\n\n3+8=11 (sum 11)\n\n5+6=11\n\netc.\n\nBut wait, looking for the minimal sum >=7.\n\nWait, perhaps 3+4=7.\n\nYes, a=3, b=4. 3+4=7.\n\nIs there a pair with sum 7?\n\nYes.\n\nSo S_min is 7.\n\nThen, we need to compute the maximum bipartite matching where a_i + b_j >=7.\n\nSo, create a bipartite graph where edges are between a_i and b_j if a_i + b_j >=7.\n\nThen, find the maximum matching.\n\nWhat's the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=7.\n\nIn the sample, the output for worst rank is 5.\n\nWait, according to the note, in the worst case, Vasya can get 5th place.\n\nSo, the maximum matching size is 5.\n\nThus, the worst rank is 5.\n\nSo, the algorithm works.\n\nNow, the task is to implement this.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead a as list.\n\nRead b as list.\n\nCompute S_min: the minimal a_i + b_j that is >=x.\n\nIf no such a_i + b_j exists, but the problem says it's guaranteed, so no need to handle that.\n\nThen, construct a bipartite graph where a_i is connected to b_j if a_i + b_j >= S_min.\n\nCompute the maximum matching in this bipartite graph.\n\nThe size of the maximum matching is the worst rank.\n\nSo, now, the problem is to implement maximum bipartite matching.\n\nGiven that n is up to 105, the standard Hopcroft-Karp algorithm can be used, which is efficient enough.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nImplement Hopcroft-Karp algorithm for maximum bipartite matching.\n\nCompute S_min as the minimal a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nConstruct the bipartite graph.\n\nRun Hopcroft-Karp to find maximum matching.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nFirst, read input.\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nCompute S_min:\n\nInitialize S_min as infinity.\n\nFor each ai in a:\n\n   for each bj in b:\n\n       if ai + bj >=x:\n\n           if (ai + bj) < S_min:\n\n               S_min = ai + bj\n\nOnce S_min is found, construct the bipartite graph.\n\nEach a_i can be connected to b_j if a_i + b_j >= S_min.\n\nThen, find maximum matching.\n\nBut since Hopcroft-Karp is for bipartite graphs, we can model this as a bipartition between a and b.\n\nEach node in the left is an index of a, and each node in the right is an index of b.\n\nAn edge exists from a[i] to b[j] if a[i] + b[j] >= S_min.\n\nNow, implement Hopcroft-Karp.\n\nThe maximum matching is the size of the maximum matching.\n\nThus, the worst rank is this size.\n\nSo, the code will be:\n\nImplement Hopcroft-Karp algorithm.\n\nRead the a and b arrays.\n\nCompute S_min.\n\nConstruct the adjacency list.\n\nRun Hopcroft-Karp.\n\nPrint 1 and the maximum matching size.\n\nWait, but in the sample input 2, the maximum matching is 5, which is the worst rank.\n\nSo, the code will print 1 and 5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, a=[2,2,2], b=[1,1,1], x=3.\n\nS_min is 3.\n\nEach a_i + b_j is 3, which is >=3.\n\nThus, maximum matching is 3.\n\nSo, worst rank is 3.\n\nSo, the code will output 1 3.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, a=[3,1], b=[4,2], x=5.\n\nS_min is 5 (1+4=5).\n\nEdges:\n\na[0] can connect to b[0] (3+4=7 >=5), and b[1] (3+2=5 >=5).\n\na[1] can connect to b[0] (1+4=5 >=5), and b[1] (1+2=3 <5 → no edge.\n\nThus, the bipartition edges are:\n\na0 → b0, b1.\n\na1 → b0.\n\nSo, maximum matching is 2.\n\nThus, worst rank is 2.\n\nSo, the code will output 1 2.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm.\n\nBut implementing Hopcroft-Karp in Python for n=105 is manageable.\n\nThe Hopcroft-Karp algorithm is suitable for bipartite graphs and finds the maximum matching efficiently.\n\nThus, the code outline is:\n\n- Read the input.\n\n- Compute S_min.\n\n- Build the adjacency list for the bipartite graph.\n\n- Run Hopcroft-Karp to find the maximum matching.\n\n- Output 1 and the size of the maximum matching.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nFirst, the Hopcroft-Karp implementation.\n\nI'll refer to standard implementations.\n\nHere's a function to implement Hopcroft-Karp.\n\nThe code will look like this:\n\ndef hopcroft_karp(graph, U, V):\n    pair_U = [-1] * U\n    pair_V = [-1] * V\n    dist = [0] * U\n\n    def bfs():\n        queue = deque()\n        for u in range(U):\n            if pair_U[u] == -1:\n                dist[u] = 0\n                queue.append(u)\n            else:\n                dist",
