The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where Neko found some chests and keys, and wants to open as many chests as possible. The way it works is that each key can unlock a specific chest if the sum of their numbers is odd. Hmm, right.\n\nLet me read the problem again to make sure I get the details right. So, for each chest i and key j, a_i + b_j must be congruent to 1 mod 2. That means one is even and the other is odd. So the key and chest numbers must be of opposite parity.\n\nSo, the goal is to maximize the number of chests opened by assigning keys to them such that each assignment satisfies this condition, and no key is used more than once, and no chest is opened by more than one key.\n\nHmm, okay. So the first thing I need to figure out is how to pair the keys and chests optimally.\n\nLet me think about the parities. Each key can either be even or odd. Similarly, each chest can be even or odd. So, for a key to open a chest, the key's parity must be different from the chest's.\n\nWait, wait. Let's see: if a_i is even, then b_j must be odd for a_i + b_j to be odd. Because even + odd = odd. And if a_i is odd, then b_j must be even.\n\nSo, the idea is to count how many even and odd chests there are, and similarly for the keys. Then, match the appropriate ones.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n- Even chests can be unlocked by odd keys.\n- Odd chests can be unlocked by even keys.\n\nSo, suppose we have:\n- C_e: number of even chests\n- C_o: number of odd chests\n- K_e: number of even keys\n- K_o: number of odd keys\n\nNow, the maximum number of chests that can be opened would be the minimum between what we can get by matching the available keys to the chests.\n\nWait, no. Because the number of possible matches depends on the available counts.\n\nFor example, the number of chests that can be opened using even keys is min(C_o, K_e), because each even key can only unlock an odd chest. Similarly, the number of chests that can be opened using odd keys is min(C_e, K_o).\n\nSo the total maximum is the sum of these two minima.\n\nWait, but is that correct?\n\nNo, wait. Because each key can be used once, and each chest can be used once. So the maximum is the sum of the two possible matches.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. The maximum number of chests is the sum of:\n   a. The minimum between the number of even keys and the number of odd chests.\n   b. The minimum between the number of odd keys and the number of even chests.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's think again.\n\nEach even key can be used to unlock an odd chest. So the number of such uses is the minimum of K_e and C_o.\n\nEach odd key can be used to unlock an even chest. So the number of such uses is the minimum of K_o and C_e.\n\nSo total chests opened is (min(K_e, C_o) + min(K_o, C_e)).\n\nBut wait, maybe not. Because if K_e is 5 and C_o is 3, you can use 3 even keys to open 3 odd chests. But if K_e is larger than C_o, you can only use as many as the chests.\n\nWait, yes. So that approach seems correct.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples given.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput:\nn=5, m=4\na = [9,14,6,2,11] → let's see parities:\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd.\nSo C_o is 2, C_e is 3.\n\nb = [8,4,7,20] → 8 even,4 even,7 odd, 20 even. So K_e is 3, K_o is 1.\n\nSo according to the formula:\nmin(3, 2) = 2 (even keys can unlock 2 odd chests)\nmin(1,3) =1 (odd keys can unlock 3 even chests)\n\nTotal 3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=5, m=1\na = [2,4,6,8,10] → all even.\nSo C_e=5, C_o=0.\n\nb = [5] → odd. K_e=0, K_o=1.\n\nSo min(K_e, C_o)= min(0,0)=0; min(K_o, C_e)= min(1,5)=",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests that Neko can open using the available keys. Each key can unlock a specific chest if the sum of their numbers is odd, meaning one must be even and the other odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count how many of the chests and keys are even and how many are odd.\n2. **Calculate Possible Matches**: \n   - Even keys can unlock odd chests, so the number of such possible matches is the minimum of the number of even keys and the number of odd chests.\n   - Odd keys can unlock even chests, so the number of such possible matches is the minimum of the number of odd keys and the number of even chests.\n3. **Sum Matches**: The total number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the two types of matches calculated above.\n\nThis approach ensures we efficiently determine the maximum number of chests that can be opened by leveraging the parity constraints of the keys and chests.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n, m = int(input[ptr]), int(input[ptr+1])\n    ptr +=2\n    a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))\n    ptr +=n\n    b = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+m]))\n    \n    # Count parities for chests\n    c_even = 0\n    c_odd = 0\n    for num in a:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            c_even +=1\n        else:\n            c_odd +=1\n    \n    # Count parities for keys\n    k_even = 0\n    k_odd = 0\n    for num in b:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            k_even +=1\n        else:\n            k_odd +=1\n    \n    # Calculate possible matches\n    match1 = min(k_even, c_odd)\n    match2 = min(k_odd, c_even)\n    \n    print(match1 + match2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of chests `n`, the number of keys `m`, the list of integers on the chests `a`, and the list of integers on the keys `b`.\n- **Counting Parities**: We iterate through both lists to count how many chests and keys are even and how many are odd.\n- **Matching Keys to Chests**: Using the counts of even and odd keys and chests, we determine the maximum number of matches where each key opens a chest of opposite parity.\n- **Output Result**: The result is the sum of these matches, which gives the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem constraints and ensures optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
