After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the number of successful students in a group. A student is considered successful if there's at least one subject where they are the best. Being the best means that no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\nHmm, so for each subject, I need to determine which student has the highest mark. Then, for each student, check if they are the top in any subject.\n\nLet me think about the steps I need to take.\n\nFirst, I'll read the input. The input starts with two integers n and m. Then there are n lines, each representing a student's grades for m subjects. Each line is a string of m characters, each being a digit from 1 to 9.\n\nFor each subject (from 0 to m-1), I need to find the maximum mark. Then, for each student, if they have that maximum in at least one subject, they are successful.\n\nWait, no. For each subject, the student who has the highest mark in that subject is the best. So for each subject, we find the maximum, and note which student(s) have that max. But only one student can be the best for each subject because if multiple students have the same max, then none of them are the best—since the condition says \"no student got a higher mark\". Oh wait, no: the condition is that a student is the best in a subject if there's no one with a higher mark. So if two students have the same max, neither is the best for that subject. Because someone else has the same as the max but not higher.\n\nSo for each subject, the best student is the one who has the highest mark, and only if they are the sole highest. Wait, no—wait, the definition says: a student is the best at a subject if there's no student with a higher mark. So even if another student has the same mark, it's allowed, because they aren't higher. So for example, if two students have 5 in a subject, both are not the best, because neither is higher than the other. So the best student for that subject is the one with the highest mark, but if multiple students have that mark, then no one is the best.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-read the problem statement:\n\n\"A student is considered the best at a subject if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\"\n\nAh! So if multiple students have the same highest mark, then none of them are the best, because each of them has others with equal marks, but not higher. Wait, no. If all have the same max, then for each, there exists another with the same mark (so not higher). So no one is the best in that subject.\n\nSo for a subject, the best student is the one with the maximum mark, but only if that maximum is unique. Otherwise, no one is the best.\n\nWait, but that might complicate things. So, for each subject, I need to find the maximum value among all students' marks for that subject. Then, check how many students have that maximum. If exactly one, then that student is the best in that subject. If more than one, no one is the best in that subject.\n\nWait, that seems correct based on the problem statement.\n\nBut wait, let's see the example given.\n\nIn the first sample input, the gradebook is:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nSo for each subject:\n\nSubject 0: the marks are 2, 2, 1. Max is 2, appears twice (students 1 and 2). So no one is the best here.\n\nSubject 1: marks are 2, 3, 1. Max is 3, only student 2. So student 2 is best in subject 1.\n\nSubject 2: marks are 3, 2, 2. Max is 3, only student 1. So student 1 is best in subject 2.\n\nSo for each subject, if the max is unique, that's the best. Else, no best.\n\nThen, for each student, check if they are the best in any subject.\n\nIn the first sample:\n\nStudent 1: best in subject 2. So he is successful.\n\nStudent 2: best in subject 1. So he is successful.\n\nStudent 3: no subjects where he is best. So not successful.\n\nThus, the output is 2.\n\nSo according to this, for each subject, the best is determined by whether the max is unique.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. For each subject s (from 0 to m-1):\n\n   a. Find the maximum mark among all students for s.\n\n   b. Count how many students have this maximum mark.\n\n   c. If count is 1, then the single student is the best for subject s.\n\n   d. Else, no one is the best.\n\n2. For each student, check if they are the best in any subject.\n\n3. Count the number of such students.\n\nSo how do I implement this?\n\nLet's outline the steps.\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen, for each of the next n lines, read the string, which represents the student's marks. Each character is a digit.\n\nWe can represent each student's marks as a list of integers.\n\nSo, for each student, we'll have a list where each element corresponds to a subject's mark.\n\nThen, for each subject s:\n\n   Collect all the marks from each student in s.\n\n   Find the maximum value among these.\n\n   Check how many students have this maximum.\n\n   If exactly one, record that student as the best for s.\n\nOnce we have, for each subject s, the list of best students (could be empty or a single student), then for each student, check if they are present in any of the best lists across all subjects.\n\nThe count of such students is the answer.\n\nNow, how to structure this.\n\nIdea:\n\n- Create a dictionary for each subject, mapping to the set of students who are the best in that subject.\n\nWait, but for each subject, the best is either a single student or none.\n\nSo perhaps for each subject, store the best student (if any).\n\nSo, for all subjects, create a list 'best_in_subject', where best_in_subject[s] is the index of the student (0-based) who is the best in subject s, or None if no one is best.\n\nThen, for each student, check if they are in any of the best_in_subject entries.\n\nIf yes, count them.\n\nSo step by step:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string of m characters.\n\nConvert each line into a list of integers.\n\nStore all students' marks as a list of lists.\n\nThen, for each subject s in 0..m-1:\n\n   Get the s-th character from each student's marks.\n\n   So for each student i, their mark in s is marks[i][s].\n\n   Find the maximum value among all marks[i][s].\n\n   Then, count how many students have this maximum.\n\n   If count is 1:\n\n      Find which student has this maximum.\n\n      Add this student's index to best_in_subject[s].\n\nElse:\n\n   best_in_subject[s] remains as None.\n\nOnce all subjects are processed, for each student i:\n\n   Check if i is in any of best_in_subject[s] for s in 0..m-1.\n\n   If yes, increment the count.\n\nFinally, output the count.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nIn Python:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nstudents = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    s = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in s]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nbest_in_subject = [None] * m\n\nfor s in range(m):\n    # Get all marks for subject s\n    max_mark = -1\n    count_max = 0\n    best_student = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        mark = students[i][s]\n        if mark > max_mark:\n            max_mark = mark\n            count_max = 1\n            best_student = i\n        elif mark == max_mark:\n            count_max += 1\n            # We don't update best_student, since we want the first occurrence\n            # Or, maybe not, since if multiple same max, no best.\n    if count_max == 1:\n        best_in_subject[s] = best_student\n    else:\n        best_in_subject[s] = None\n\n# Now, count the number of students who are in any best_in_subject[s]\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for s in range(m):\n        if best_in_subject[s] == i:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but wait: for each subject, we collect the best student as the first one who achieved the max. But if another student later has the same max, we don't update. So in the case where multiple students have the same max, the best_in_subject[s] remains as the first one.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, if multiple students have the same max, then no one is the best. So in that case, best_in_subject[s] should be None.\n\nWait, in the code above, when count_max is greater than 1, we set best_in_subject[s] to None. So that part is correct.\n\nYes, so the code seems to handle that.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nSo the students' marks are:\n\nStudent 0: [2,2,3]\n\nStudent 1: [2,3,2]\n\nStudent 2: [1,1,2]\n\nProcessing each subject:\n\nSubject 0:\n\nmarks are 2,2,1.\n\nmax is 2, occurs twice.\n\ncount_max is 2, so best_in_subject[0] is None.\n\nSubject 1:\n\nmarks are 2,3,1.\n\nmax is 3, occurs once. best_in_subject[1] = 1.\n\nSubject 2:\n\nmarks are 3,2,2.\n\nmax is 3, occurs once. best_in_subject[2] = 0.\n\nSo best_in_subject is [None, 1, 0].\n\nNow, for each student:\n\nStudent 0: is he best in any subject? Yes, subject 2.\n\nStudent 1: is he best in subject 1. So yes.\n\nStudent 2: No.\n\nSo count is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: second sample input.\n\nInput:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nSo each student's marks:\n\nStudent 0: [9,1,7,2,8]\n\nStudent 1: [1,1,8,2,8]\n\nStudent 2: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nProcessing each subject:\n\nSubject 0:\n\nmarks are 9,1,1. Max is 9, count 1. So best is 0.\n\nSubject 1:\n\nmarks are 1,1,1. All same. So count_max is 3. Best_in_subject is None.\n\nSubject 2:\n\nmarks are 7,8,1. Max is 8, count 1. So best is 1.\n\nSubject 3:\n\nmarks are 2,2,1. Max is 2, count 2. So best_in_subject[3] is None.\n\nSubject 4:\n\nmarks are 8,8,1. Max is 8, count 2. So best_in_subject[4] is None.\n\nSo best_in_subject is [0, None, 1, None, None].\n\nSo for each student:\n\nStudent 0: is in subject 0. So yes.\n\nStudent 1: is in subject 2. Yes.\n\nStudent 2: No.\n\nSo count is 2? But the sample output is 3.\n\nWait, wait, no, the sample output is 3. So my code must be wrong.\n\nWait wait, the second sample's output is 3. Let me see why.\n\nWait, the second sample's input is:\n\n3 5\n\n91728 → student 0: 9,1,7,2,8\n\n11828 → student 1:1,1,8,2,8\n\n11111 → student 2:1,1,1,1,1\n\nSo for each subject:\n\nSubject 0:\n\nOnly student 0 has 9. So best is 0.\n\nSubject 1:\n\nAll have 1 except no, wait no: student 0 has 1, student 1 has 1, student 2 has 1. So all have same. So no best.\n\nSubject 2:\n\nstudent 0:7, student1:8, student2:1.\n\nMax is 8, only student 1. So best is 1.\n\nSubject 3:\n\nstudent0:2, student1:2, student2:1. So max is 2, occurs for both 0 and 1. So count_max is 2. So no best.\n\nSubject4:\n\nstudent0:8, student1:8, student2:1. Max is 8, occurs for 0 and 1. So no best.\n\nSo best_in_subject is [0, None, 1, None, None].\n\nNow, for each student:\n\nStudent 0: is best in subject 0. So yes.\n\nStudent 1: is best in subject 2. So yes.\n\nStudent 2: not best in any subject. So no.\n\nWait, but sample output is 3. Hmm, something's wrong.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem statement. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the subjects are processed.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the processing of the second sample.\n\nWait, student 0's marks are 9,1,7,2,8.\n\nStudent 1: 1,1,8,2,8.\n\nStudent2:1,1,1,1,1.\n\nSo for subject 0: max is 9, only student 0. So best_in_subject[0] = 0.\n\nSubject 1: all have 1. So no best.\n\nSubject 2: student 1 has 8, others have lower. So best is 1.\n\nSubject 3: student0 has 2, student1 has 2, student2 has 1. So max is 2, but two students have it. So no best.\n\nSubject4: student0 has 8, student1 has 8. So two students, no best.\n\nSo the best_in_subject is [0, None, 1, None, None].\n\nSo for each student:\n\nStudent0: in subject0, yes.\n\nStudent1: in subject2, yes.\n\nStudent2: not in any best.\n\nSo total is 2. But the sample output is 3.\n\nHmm, that suggests that my understanding is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem statement. Let me re-read.\n\nProblem statement says: a student is successful if there exists at least one subject where he is the best.\n\nWait, perhaps the way I'm determining the best is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: for a student to be the best in a subject, they must have the maximum mark for that subject, regardless of whether others have the same maximum.\n\nWait, that would change everything.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"a student is the best at some subject if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\"\n\nSo, if a student has the maximum mark in a subject, and no one has a higher mark, then they are the best in that subject.\n\nSo, even if another student has the same maximum, that doesn't affect the fact that the first student is the best.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the condition is: no student has a higher mark. So if two students have the same max, they are not better than each other. Because neither has a higher mark than the other.\n\nSo for a subject, the best student is the one with the highest mark, but only if they are the only one with that mark.\n\nIf multiple students have the same highest mark, then no one is the best in that subject.\n\nWait, that's what I thought earlier.\n\nBut in the sample input 2, the second student has 8 in subject 4, same as student 0.\n\nSo, for subject 4, no one is the best.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, it says each student is the best in at least one subject.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I process the second sample.\n\nWait, the second sample's output is 3, meaning all three students are successful.\n\nSo what's happening here.\n\nLet me re-examine the second sample.\n\nEach student's marks:\n\nStudent0: 9,1,7,2,8 → in subject0, 9 is the max, no one else has 9. So he is best in subject0.\n\nStudent1:1,1,8,2,8 → in subject2, 8 is max, no one else has 8 in that subject. So he is best in subject2.\n\nStudent1 also has 8 in subject4. But in subject4, student0 also has 8. So for subject4, no one is best.\n\nBut wait, in subject4, the max is 8, but both have it. So no one is best.\n\nBut student1 is best in subject2. So he is successful.\n\nStudent2: his marks are all 1. So in no subject is he the best.\n\nWait, that's not matching the sample output. So the sample output is 3, but according to my analysis, only two students are successful.\n\nHmm, that suggests that perhaps I have a misunderstanding of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have a bug in my code.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement allows for a student to be the best in a subject if they are tied for the maximum, as long as they are not exceeded.\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem statement.\n\n\"A student is considered the best at some subject if there exists a subject he is the best at.\"\n\n\"A student is the best at a subject if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\"\n\nSo, if a student has the maximum mark in a subject, and no one has a higher mark, then he is the best.\n\nBut if another student has the same maximum, then for that subject, neither is the best because the other has the same mark.\n\nWait, but that's not the case. Because the condition is that no one has a higher mark. So if two students have the same maximum, they are both not worse than each other. So, for that subject, neither is the best.\n\nSo in the second sample:\n\nStudent0 is best in subject0.\n\nStudent1 is best in subject2.\n\nStudent2 is not best in any.\n\nThus, the count is 2, but the sample expects 3.\n\nThis indicates that perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWhat's wrong?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement's note:\n\n\"In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\"\n\nSo all three students are successful. So according to the sample, each of them is the best in at least one subject.\n\nBut according to my analysis, student2 isn't.\n\nSo perhaps my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the way I'm considering best is incorrect.\n\nMaybe for a subject, the best student is the one who has the maximum, regardless of whether others have the same maximum. So if a student has the maximum, even if others have the same, he is considered the best.\n\nBut that would contradict the problem statement.\n\nWait, let's think differently.\n\nSuppose for a subject, the maximum mark is M. Any student who has M is a candidate for being the best. But the problem says, a student is the best if there is no student with a higher mark. So, if two students have M, then neither is better than the other, because each has the same as the other. So for that subject, no one is the best.\n\nBut perhaps the problem defines the best as the one with the maximum, and if multiple students have the same maximum, only the first is considered the best.\n\nNo, that's not what the problem says.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers that a student is the best in a subject if they have the maximum, and even if others have the same, they are considered the best.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the condition.\n\nThe condition is: a student is the best at a subject if there is no student who got a higher mark.\n\nSo, for a student to be the best in a subject, it's sufficient that for that subject, their mark is >= all others.\n\nWait, no. It's required that no student has a higher mark.\n\nSo, for a student to be the best in a subject, their mark must be the highest possible.\n\nIf two students have the same highest mark, then for that subject, neither is the best.\n\nSo, the initial approach was correct.\n\nBut then in the second sample, student2 is not a best in any subject.\n\nBut the sample says all three are successful.\n\nSo perhaps my analysis is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that if a student is among the maximums, regardless of whether it's unique, then he is the best.\n\nWait, that would mean that if a student is in the maximum group, he is the best in that subject.\n\nBut that would change the problem statement.\n\nBecause the problem statement says, \"there is no student who got a higher mark\".\n\nSo, for example, if a student has the same mark as another, they are not better than each other because neither has a higher mark than the other.\n\nThus, for a subject, the best student is the one who has the maximum, but only if that maximum is unique.\n\nOtherwise, no one is the best.\n\nSo, in the second sample:\n\nStudent0 is best in subject0.\n\nStudent1 is best in subject2.\n\nSubject4: both have 8. So no one is the best.\n\nBut student1 is also best in subject4?\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, in subject4, the max is 8. Both student0 and student1 have 8.\n\nSo, for that subject, neither is the best.\n\nSo, student1 is only best in subject2.\n\nBut the sample says each student is successful.\n\nHmm, so perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWhat's different between my analysis and the sample's conclusion?\n\nIn the sample explanation, it says:\n\n\"In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\"\n\nSo, perhaps each student is the best in at least one subject.\n\nSo, for student2, perhaps he is the best in a subject.\n\nBut according to the data, his marks are 1,1,1,1,1.\n\nSo in all subjects, he has 1.\n\nWhich means, for each subject, someone else has a higher mark.\n\nThus, he cannot be the best in any subject.\n\nSo why does the sample say all three are successful?\n\nThis suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in reading the input.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the input for the second sample.\n\nThe input is:\n\n3 5\n\n91728 → student0: 9,1,7,2,8.\n\n11828 → student1: 1,1,8,2,8.\n\n11111 → student2: 1,1,1,1,1.\n\nSo, subject4: student0 has 8, student1 has 8.\n\nThus, no one is the best.\n\nBut wait, for subject0, student0 is the only one with 9. So he is the best.\n\nSubject1: all have 1. So no best.\n\nSubject2: student1 has 8, which is higher than others. So he is the best.\n\nSubject3: student0 has 2, student1 has 2. So no best.\n\nSubject4: both have 8. So no best.\n\nSo student0 is best in subject0.\n\nStudent1 is best in subject2.\n\nStudent2 is not best in any subject.\n\nThus, the count should be 2, but the sample says 3.\n\nThis suggests that my approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I read the input incorrectly.\n\nLooking back, the input for the second sample is written as:\n\n['3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\nWait, perhaps the second line is 11828, but perhaps it's 118288?\n\nOr maybe I have a typo.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nWhich would give the marks as:\n\nstudent0:9,1,7,2,8.\n\nstudent1:1,1,8,2,8.\n\nstudent2:1,1,1,1,1.\n\nBut then, in that case, for subject4, student1 has 8, same as student0.\n\nSo no one is best.\n\nBut the sample says all three are successful. So I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement allows a student to be the best in a subject if they are among those with the maximum, even if others have the same.\n\nMeaning, for a subject, the best is the student with the maximum, regardless of whether others also have it.\n\nSo, in that case, for the second sample:\n\nstudent0 is best in subject0.\n\nstudent1 is best in subject2 and subject4.\n\nstudent2 is best in no subjects.\n\nThus, the count is 3.\n\nBut that would imply that the condition is simply to have the maximum, not necessarily unique.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem statement is ambiguous.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the condition is that a student is the best if no one has a higher mark. So, if two students have the same maximum, neither is the best.\n\nBut according to the sample, the second student is considered the best in at least one subject.\n\nWhich suggests that the problem's condition is that a student is the best in a subject if they are among the students with the maximum in that subject.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that a student is the best in a subject if their mark is the maximum, regardless of whether it's unique.\n\nThus, for a subject, any student with the maximum is the best.\n\nSo, for the second sample, in subject4, both student0 and 1 are best.\n\nBut then, for each student, if they are a best in any subject, they are counted.\n\nThus, in the second sample:\n\nstudent0 is best in subject0 and subject4.\n\nstudent1 is best in subject2 and subject4.\n\nstudent2 is not best in any.\n\nThus, all three students are best in at least one subject (students 0 and 1 are best in two, student2 in none). So the count is 3.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the initial approach was incorrect. The correct condition is that a student is the best in a subject if their mark is the maximum, regardless of whether others have the same.\n\nThus, for each subject, all students with the maximum are considered best in that subject.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each subject s:\n\n   find the maximum mark.\n\n   collect all students who have this mark.\n\n   for each such student, mark them as best in subject s.\n\nThus, a student can be best in multiple subjects.\n\nBut how to represent that.\n\nSo, for each subject, for each student who has the maximum mark, add them to the list of best students for that subject.\n\nThen, for each student, if they are in any of the best lists for any subject, count them.\n\nSo, this changes the approach.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nInstead of per subject having a single best student, it's possible to have multiple.\n\nThus, best_in_subject is a list of sets, where each set contains the indices of students who are best in that subject.\n\nWait, but that's not efficient for checking.\n\nAlternatively, for each subject, for each student, if their mark is the maximum for that subject, add them to a set for that subject.\n\nThen, for each student, check if they are present in any of the subject's best sets.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each subject s:\n\n   find the maximum mark among all students in s.\n\n   collect all students i where students[i][s] == max_mark.\n\n   add i to best_in_subject[s].\n\nThen, for each student i, if i is in any of the best_in_subject[s], count +=1.\n\nYes, that's the correct approach.\n\nSo, let's adjust the code.\n\nIn code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    s = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in s]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nbest_in_subject = [set() for _ in range(m)]\n\nfor s in range(m):\n    max_mark = -1\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][s] > max_mark:\n            max_mark = students[i][s]\n    # Now, collect all students who have max_mark in subject s\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][s] == max_mark:\n            best_in_subject[s].add(i)\n\n# Now, for each student, check if they are in any best_in_subject[s]\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for s in range(m):\n        if i in best_in_subject[s]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes, this should work.\n\nLet's test this with the second sample.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=3, m=5.\n\nStudents:\n\n0: [9,1,7,2,8]\n\n1: [1,1,8,2,8]\n\n2: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nProcessing each subject:\n\nSubject 0:\n\nmax_mark is 9.\n\nOnly student0 has it. So best_in_subject[0] = {0}.\n\nSubject1:\n\nall have 1. max is 1.\n\nSo best_in_subject[1] = {0,1,2}.\n\nSubject2:\n\nmax is 8.\n\nStudent1 has 8. So best_in_subject[2] = {1}.\n\nSubject3:\n\nmax is 2.\n\nStudents0 and1 have it. So best_in_subject[3] = {0,1}.\n\nSubject4:\n\nmax is 8.\n\nStudents0 and1 have it. So best_in_subject[4] = {0,1}.\n\nThus, for each student:\n\nStudent0: in subject0, yes.\n\nStudent1: in subject1, subject2, subject3, subject4. So yes.\n\nStudent2: in subject1, yes.\n\nThus, all three students are considered successful. So count is 3.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThus, the correct approach is to consider that any student who has the maximum mark in a subject is the best, regardless of others.\n\nSo the code needs to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nThus, the code should:\n\n- For each subject, find the max.\n\n- Collect all students who have that max.\n\n- For each such student, add them to the best_in_subject for that subject.\n\n- Then, for each student, if they are in any best_in_subject[s], count them.\n\nThus, the code is as written above.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nSample1:\n\nn=3, m=3.\n\nStudents:\n\n0: 2,2,3\n\n1:2,3,2\n\n2:1,1,2.\n\nProcessing subjects:\n\nsubject0:\n\nmax is 2.\n\nstudents 0 and1 have it. So best_in_subject[0] = {0,1}.\n\nsubject1:\n\nmax is 3. Only student1. So {1}.\n\nsubject2:\n\nmax is 3. Only student0. So {0}.\n\nThus, for each student:\n\nstudent0 is in subject2: yes.\n\nstudent1 is in subject1: yes.\n\nstudent2: no.\n\nCount is 2.\n\nWhich matches sample.\n\nThus, the code should handle the cases correctly.\n\nSo, in the code, I've corrected the approach to include all students with the maximum mark in each subject.\n\nSo, the final code is as written above.\n\nI think this should solve the problem correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks across multiple subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students and subjects, followed by the gradebook data.\n2. **Identify Best Students per Subject**: For each subject, determine the maximum mark. Collect all students who achieved this maximum mark as the best students for that subject.\n3. **Count Successful Students**: Check each student to see if they are among the best students for any subject. Count how many such students exist.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    s = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in s]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nbest_in_subject = [set() for _ in range(m)]\n\nfor s in range(m):\n    max_mark = -1\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][s] > max_mark:\n            max_mark = students[i][s]\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][s] == max_mark:\n            best_in_subject[s].add(i)\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for s in range(m):\n        if i in best_in_subject[s]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of students `n`, the number of subjects `m`, and the gradebook data for each student.\n2. **Finding Best Students**: For each subject, we determine the highest mark. All students who achieved this mark are recorded as the best students for that subject.\n3. **Counting Success**: Each student is checked against the list of best students for each subject. If a student is found in any of these lists, they are counted as successful.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine which students are successful by leveraging sets to track best students per subject and iterating through each student to check their success across all subjects.",
