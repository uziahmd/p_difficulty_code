The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lex smaller than q, and the number of inversions in p is greater than in q. And then output this count modulo a given mod value.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. The constraints are n up to 500, which isn't too bad, but I need an efficient solution. Let's start by understanding what's required.\n\nFirst, inversions: for each permutation, I can calculate the number of inversions. Then, for all possible pairs (p, q), I need to check two conditions: p < q lex order, and inv(p) > inv(q). But considering all pairs directly would be O(n!^2), which is impossible even for n=10 because 10! is about 3.6 million, squared is way too big.\n\nSo I need a smarter way to compute this without enumerating all pairs.\n\nLet me consider the properties of permutations. For a pair (p, q) to satisfy p < q lex-wise, the first position where they differ must have p's element less than q's. So, perhaps I can model this as building p and q step by step, keeping track of certain parameters.\n\nWait, but how does the inversion count come into play here? Maybe there's a way to model this using dynamic programming, tracking the necessary information to compute both the lex order and inversion counts.\n\nAnother thought: for each possible pair of permutations (p, q), p < q lex implies that at the first differing position, p[i] < q[i]. Also, since p and q are distinct (they are both permutations), this will always hold somewhere.\n\nBut how can I model the state in a DP? Hmm, perhaps the state can include some information about the current partial permutation, like the elements chosen so far, and the inversion counts of p and q.\n\nWait, but that might be too much. Because for each position, the choices for p and q affect their inversion counts, which are global properties. So maybe I can find a way to represent the state in terms of the elements chosen so far, and some other parameters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can precompute for each permutation p, the number of permutations q that are larger than p lex-wise and have fewer inversions than p. Summing over all p would give the answer.\n\nBut again, with n=500, that's 500! permutations, which is way too big. So that approach isn't feasible.\n\nWait, another angle: the total number of pairs where p < q lex is equal to the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q and p is lex smaller than q. Since for any two distinct permutations, exactly one is lex smaller than the other. So the total number is (n!*(n! -1))/2.\n\nBut we need to find among these pairs, how many have inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the total is the sum over all p < q (lex order) of whether inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nIs there a way to model this using some combinatorial arguments or mathematical properties?\n\nLet me think about the relationship between lex order and inversion counts. For example, if p is lex smaller than q, what can we say about their inversion counts?\n\nNot sure. Maybe it's not directly related. So perhaps I should model the problem as a DP where I build p and q step by step, ensuring that p remains lex smaller than q, and track their inversion counts.\n\nEach step, I choose the next element for p and q, ensuring that at each step, the choices don't violate the lex condition. Also, track the number of inversions added by each choice.\n\nHmm, that seems manageable. Let's formalize this.\n\nThe state of the DP could be:\n\n- pos: the current position being considered (from 0 to n-1).\n- p_mask: a bitmask representing which elements have been used in p so far.\n- q_mask: a bitmask representing which elements have been used in q so far.\n- a: the last element chosen for p.\n- b: the last element chosen for q.\n\nWait, but even that might be too memory-intensive. Because for each state, we need to track a lot of information. Alternatively, perhaps we can represent the state in a way that captures the necessary constraints.\n\nWait, but for the lex order, the key is that up to the current position, p is lex smaller than q. So, for the first k positions where p and q differ, p has a smaller element. So, the decision at each step depends on whether we've already fixed the lex order, or are still in the phase where the lex order hasn't been determined yet.\n\nMaybe the state can be represented as:\n\n- pos: current position.\n- is_lex_smaller: a boolean indicating whether up to this point, p is lex smaller",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lexicographically smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than the number of inversions in q. The result should be returned modulo a given value.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves using dynamic programming (DP) to efficiently explore all possible valid permutations while keeping track of necessary information to ensure both conditions are met. The key steps are:\n\n1. **State Representation**: The DP state is defined by:\n   - `pos`: The current position being processed.\n   - `p_mask` and `q_mask`: Bitmasks representing which elements have been used in permutations p and q so far.\n   - `a` and `b`: The last elements chosen for p and q respectively.\n   - `inv_p` and `inv_q`: The number of inversions accumulated so far for p and q.\n\n2. **Transition**: For each step, we consider all valid choices for the next element in p and q, ensuring that p remains lexicographically smaller than q. This involves checking if the current choice maintains the lex order and updating the inversion counts accordingly.\n\n3. **Base Case**: When all positions are processed, we check if the inversion count of p is greater than that of q and update the result accordingly.\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, we take modulo operations at each step to prevent overflow and ensure the result fits within standard data types.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nn = int(input().split()[0])\nmod = int(input().split()[1])\n\nmax_mask = (1 << n)\ndp = [[[0] * (n + 2) for _ in range(n + 2)] for __ in range(max_mask)]\nfor i in range(max_mask):\n    for j in range(max_mask):\n        for k in range(n+1):\n            dp[i][j][k] = 0\n\n# Initialize base case: when no elements are chosen, both have 0 inversions\ndp[0][0][0] = 1\n\nfor pos in range(n):\n    for p_mask in range(max_mask):\n        for q_mask in range(max_mask):\n            for a in range(1, n+1):\n                if (p_mask & (1 << (a-1))) == 0:\n                    continue\n                for b in range(1, n+1):\n                    if (q_mask & (1 << (b-1))) == 0:\n                        continue\n                    current_inv_p = dp[p_mask][q_mask][0]\n                    current_inv_q = dp[p_mask][q_mask][1]\n                    # Determine if choosing a and b at this position will keep p < q lex\n                    # We need to ensure that up to this point, p is lex smaller than q\n                    # If we have already determined p < q, then any choice is allowed\n                    # Otherwise, a must be < b\n                    # But since we're building the permutations step by step, the previous state must have ensured p is lex smaller\n                    # So, here, the current a and b can be anything as long as they are in their respective available sets\n                    # But actually, the previous state's condition must have already determined whether p is lex smaller\n                    # So in the transition, the lex condition is already enforced based on prior steps\n                    # Therefore, in this step, as long as p_mask and q_mask are built correctly, the lex condition is maintained\n                    # So, for the current step, the only thing is to choose a and b such that they are not used yet\n                    # And then compute the new inversion contributions\n                    # Now, compute the new inversion counts\n                    # For p, adding a to the end will create some inversions with elements before it in p\n                    # Similarly for q, adding b will create some inversions with elements before it in q\n                    # The number of new inversions contributed by a is the number of elements already in p that are larger than a\n                    # Similarly for b\n                    # So, for the current p_mask, the number of elements already in p that are larger than a is the number of set bits in p_mask that are > a\n                    # To compute this quickly, precompute for each a, how many elements in p_mask are larger than a\n                    # Similarly for q_mask and b\n                    # However, in practice, for each a, the count is sum over bits set in p_mask where the bit is higher than a\n                    # So, for each a, we can iterate through all possible higher numbers and see if they are in p_mask\n                    # But this might be slow, so perhaps we can find a way to represent it more efficiently\n                    # For now, let's proceed with this approach\n                    new_p_mask = p_mask | (1 << (a-1))\n                    new_q_mask = q_mask | (1 << (b-1))\n                    # Calculate the number of elements already in p that are greater than a\n                    cnt_p = 0\n                    for x in range(a+1, n+1):\n                        if (p_mask & (1 << (x-1))):\n                            cnt_p += 1\n                    # Calculate the number of elements already in q that are greater than b\n                    cnt_q = 0\n                    for x in range(b+1, n+1):\n                        if (q_mask & (1 << (x-1))):\n                            cnt_q += 1\n                    # Update the inversion counts\n                    new_inv_p = current_inv_p + cnt_p\n                    new_inv_q = current_inv_q + cnt_q\n                    # Check if the new_inv_p is greater than new_inv_q\n                    # Then add the corresponding value to dp[new_p_mask][new_q_mask][...]\n                    # Wait, but we also need to track whether p is lex smaller than q so far\n                    # Wait, no: because the lex order is determined by the first differing position.
