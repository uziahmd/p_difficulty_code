For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine whether a given triad is major, minor, or strange. Hmm, let's break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the problem statement says that a major triad has notes X, Y, Z such that when ordered correctly, the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones and Y to Z is 3. So together, they form a perfect fifth (7 semitones in total). For a minor triad, the distances are 3 and 4 semitones respectively, adding up to 7 as well, but in a different order.\n\nThe input is three notes, like 'C E G', and I need to process them. The output is either 'major', 'minor', or 'strange'.\n\nSo my plan is:\n\n1. Read the three notes.\n2. Generate all possible permutations of these three notes.\n3. For each permutation, check if it forms a major or minor triad.\n4. Once a permutation is found that fits either major or minor, decide which one it is based on the order.\n5. If none fit, it's strange.\n\nBut wait, how do I represent the notes numerically? Because then I can calculate the distances between them.\n\nI think I should assign each note a numerical value based on their position in the scale. Let me list them:\n\nThe order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait. Wait, the problem says the notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, is that correct? Or is H perhaps a typo? Because normally, in music theory, the sequence is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B, and then back to C. Oh, but the problem states that after H comes C again. Wait, maybe the problem uses H instead of B? Or perhaps it's a mistake, but according to the problem statement, H is the last note before C. So the list is:\n\nNotes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nWait, no, wait: the problem says \"the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H.\" So the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So that's 12 notes, right?\n\nWait, count: C (1), C# (2), D (3), D# (4), E (5), F (6), F# (7), G (8), G# (9), A (10), B (11), H (12). Yes, that makes 12 notes. So the order is as above.\n\nSo I'll create a list of the notes in order, with their positions from 0 to 11. Wait, perhaps mapping each note to its index in the list will help. So for example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, and so on up to H being 11.\n\nWait, no. Because the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So H is the 12th note, but in terms of indexes, perhaps 0-based. So I'll create a list where the index corresponds to the note's position.\n\nSo first, I need to create a dictionary or a list that maps each note to its position. Like:\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nSo the index of each note in this list will be their position. So for example, the index of C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc., and H is 11.\n\nOnce I have this, for any two notes, I can compute the distance between them as (y - x) mod 12. But wait, because the distance is measured from the lower note to the higher one, so the distance is always positive.\n\nWait, for example, between C (0) and E (4): 4-0=4 semitones. Between E and C: (0 + 12 -4) mod 12? No, because the distance is always the minimal step forward. So the distance between any two notes x and y is (y - x) % 12, but only if y >=x, else 12 - (x - y). Wait, no, because the scale is cyclic.\n\nWait, no. The distance between x and y, moving forward, is (y - x) % 12. Because if y is after x, it's positive. If x is after y, then (y -x) is negative, so mod 12 gives the correct positive distance.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nCase 1: x=0 (C), y=4 (E). y-x=4 → correct.\n\nCase 2: x=4, y=0. (0-4)=-4 mod12 is 8. Which is correct because the distance from E to C is 8 semitones (since moving forward, you go E-F-F#-G-G#-A-A#-B-H-C, which is 8 steps).\n\nYes, so the distance function is (y -x) % 12.\n\nSo now, for a given set of three notes, say A, B, C, I need to consider all permutations of these three notes and see if any permutation satisfies the major or minor condition.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each permutation of the three notes as (X, Y, Z):\n\nCompute the distance between X and Y: d1 = (Y - X) % 12.\n\nCompute the distance between Y and Z: d2 = (Z - Y) % 12.\n\nCheck if d1 + d2 ==7.\n\nIf yes, then:\n\nIf d1 ==4 and d2 ==3 → major.\n\nElse if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor.\n\nIf both conditions are not met, continue to next permutation.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies either condition, then the chord is major or minor, depending on which condition is met.\n\nIf none of the permutations satisfy, then it's strange.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three notes as a list.\n\n2. Generate all possible permutations of these three notes.\n\n3. For each permutation (X, Y, Z):\n\n   a. Compute d1 = (Y_pos - X_pos) %12.\n\n   b. Compute d2 = (Z_pos - Y_pos) %12.\n\n   c. If d1 +d2 !=7 → skip.\n\n   d. Else, check if (d1, d2) is (4,3) → major.\n\n   e. Else, check if (d1, d2) is (3,4) → minor.\n\n   f. If either case is true, record the result and break out of loops.\n\n4. After checking all permutations, if we found a major or minor, output accordingly. Else, output strange.\n\nNow, what about the order of checking? Because once a permutation satisfies, we can stop and return.\n\nBut since there are 6 permutations for three distinct notes, it's manageable.\n\nSo now, the code structure would be:\n\n- Create the note_order list.\n\n- Create a dictionary to map each note to its index.\n\n- Read the three notes into a list.\n\n- Iterate through all 6 permutations of these three notes.\n\n- For each permutation, get X, Y, Z.\n\n- Get their positions from the note_order.\n\n- Compute d1 and d2.\n\n- Check if d1 +d2 ==7.\n\n- Then check if it's major or minor.\n\n- If found, store the result and break.\n\n- After all permutations, output the result.\n\nWait, but the same triad might have multiple permutations that satisfy the condition. But the problem says that the answer is unique, so no triad can be both major and minor. So once we find a permutation that is major, we can immediately return 'major'. Similarly for minor.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nLet's see:\n\nFirst case: C, E, G.\n\nPermutation C, E, G.\n\nPositions: C is 0, E is4, G is7.\n\nd1 =4-0=4.\n\nd2=7-4=3.\n\nSum is7.\n\nSo 4+3=7, and the pair (4,3) → major.\n\nSo output is major.\n\nSecond case: C#, B, F.\n\nLooking at all permutations:\n\nOne permutation is B, C#, F.\n\nB is position 10, C# is 1, F is5.\n\nd1 = (1-10) mod12 → (1-10)= -9 mod12=3.\n\nd2=5-1=4.\n\nSum is7.\n\nSo 3+4=7.\n\nSo this is minor.\n\nThird case: A, B, H.\n\nLooking for any permutation that sums to7.\n\nCheck each permutation:\n\nA (9), B(10), H(11).\n\nPossible permutations:\n\nA,B,H → d1=1, d2=1 → sum 2 → no.\n\nA,H,B → d1= (11-9)=2, d2=(10-11) mod12=11? Wait, no:\n\nWait, for A, H, B:\n\nX=A (9), Y=H (11), Z=B (10).\n\nd1 = (11-9) mod12=2.\n\nd2 = (10-11) mod12= (10-11) =-1 mod12=11. So sum is 13, which is more than 7. So not.\n\nAnother permutation: B,A,H.\n\nX=B (10), Y=A (9). d1 = (9-10) mod12=11.\n\nThen Y to Z is H (11). d2=(11-9) mod12=2. Sum 13.\n\nNo.\n\nB,H,A: X=B (10), Y=H (11), Z=A (9).\n\nd1 =1, d2 = (9-11) mod12= (9-11) is -2 mod12=10. Sum 11.\n\nNo.\n\nH,A,B: X=H (11), Y=A (9), Z=B (10).\n\nd1 = (9-11) mod12= 10. d2=(10-9)=1. Sum 11.\n\nNo.\n\nH,B,A: X=H (11), Y=B (10), Z=A (9).\n\nd1 = (10-11) mod12= 11. d2=(9-10) mod12= 11. Sum 22.\n\nNo.\n\nSo none of the permutations for this triad add to 7. So it's strange.\n\nThus, the sample output is ['major', 'minor', 'strange'].\n\nNow, another example: what about a minor triad like C, D, Eb?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWait, C is 0, D is2, Eb is... Wait, in our note_order, Eb isn't present. Wait, in the note_order list, E is 4, F is5, F# is6, G is7, etc. So what is Eb? Oh wait, the problem says the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So Eb is not part of the standard list. Wait, perhaps the problem treats each note as written, including sharps and flats. Wait, no, the problem says the notes are those in the given list, so perhaps the input can only consist of these notes. So the input is three of these.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says the teacher gives Vasya some notes, but the input is three space-separated notes in the notation given. So the notes are exactly as per the problem's list.\n\nSo in code, when processing the input, each note must be in the note_order list. So during the code, if any note is not in the note_order, it's invalid. But according to the problem statement, the input is correct, as per the problem's note.\n\nSo in code, perhaps I don't need to handle invalid notes.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead the three notes as a list, split by space.\n\nCreate a list of the three notes.\n\nGenerate all permutations of these three notes.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\nGet X, Y, Z.\n\nFind their positions in the note_order list.\n\nCompute d1 = (Y_pos - X_pos) mod12.\n\nCompute d2 = (Z_pos - Y_pos) mod12.\n\nCheck if d1 +d2 ==7.\n\nIf yes, proceed.\n\nElse, continue.\n\nIf it is, then check if (d1, d2) is (4,3) → major.\n\nElse, if (d1, d2) is (3,4) → minor.\n\nOnce any permutation satisfies, record the result.\n\nSince the problem says the answer is unique, once any permutation satisfies, we can stop.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to implement this.\n\nIn Python, the itertools.permutations function can generate all possible orderings.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_map = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    x_pos = note_map[x]\n    y_pos = note_map[y]\n    z_pos = note_map[z]\n\n    d1 = (y_pos - x_pos) % 12\n    d2 = (z_pos - y_pos) % 12\n\n    if d1 + d2 ==7:\n        if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            exit()\n        elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but wait: the problem says that the triad is unordered. So for a permutation, any ordering could give the correct distances, but only if when ordered in that permutation, X, Y, Z form a major or minor.\n\nWait, but the permutation is considering all possible orders, so it's okay.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: ['C E G']\n\nProcessing:\n\nEach permutation is considered.\n\nOne permutation is C, E, G.\n\nx_pos=0, y=4, z=7.\n\nd1=4, d2=3 → sum 7. So major, output.\n\nSample Input 2: ['C# B F']\n\nLooking for a permutation where d1=3, d2=4.\n\nTake permutation B, C#, F.\n\nB is 10, C# is1, F is5.\n\nd1=(1-10) mod12 → (1-10) =-9 mod12=3.\n\nd2= (5-1)=4.\n\nSum is7. So 3,4 → minor.\n\nSample Input3: ['A B H']\n\nAll permutations checked, none satisfy the condition. So output is 'strange'.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about a case where a permutation may not be the correct order but the distances still add up?\n\nWait, suppose the triad is G, C, E.\n\nG is7, C is0, E is4.\n\nAs a permutation: G, C, E.\n\nd1 = (0-7) mod12 =5.\n\nd2= (4-0) mod12=4.\n\nSum 9. Not 7.\n\nWait, but perhaps another permutation: C, E, G.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code correctly finds the major.\n\nAnother test case: Minor triad.\n\nNotes: C, D#, G.\n\nWait, C is0, D# is3, G is7.\n\nPermutation C, D#, G.\n\nd1=3-0=3.\n\nd2=7-3=4.\n\nSum 7. So minor.\n\nThus, the code would output minor.\n\nAnother edge case: what if the triad is E, G, C.\n\nE is4, G is7, C is0.\n\nWait, but in a permutation E, G, C.\n\nd1=7-4=3.\n\nd2=0-7=5 mod12 is5.\n\nSum 8.\n\nNo. But another permutation: C, E, G.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code correctly identifies it.\n\nWhat about a triad that has all three notes same? Well, the problem says the triad has exactly three notes, but they can be the same. Wait, no, because it's an unordered set of three notes. So if all three are same, the distances would be zero, so sum is zero. So it would be strange.\n\nBut the problem says it's a triad, so probably the input will have three distinct notes. But the code handles even if they are same.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Are the note_order and note_map correctly defined? Because if the note list is wrong, the code will fail.\n\nYes, in the code, note_order is as per the problem statement.\n\nAnother thing: the problem says that the teacher gave three notes, so the code can assume that the input is valid.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nAnother point: the input is read as a list of three strings, possibly with spaces. So in the code, the input is split into three elements.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, let's write the code accordingly.\n\nWait, but in the code, the loop for permutations could be optimized. Once a permutation is found, it breaks and returns. So for the worst case, it checks all 6 permutations, but in most cases, it finds the answer quickly.\n\nSo, the code is efficient.\n\nAnother thing: what about the order in which the permutations are generated? It doesn't matter since all possibilities are considered.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given triad of musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. A major chord is defined by specific distances between its notes, as is a minor chord. If the triad does not fit either category, it is classified as strange.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Notes and Distances**: The musical notes are given in a cyclic order, and each note is assigned a position in this order. The distance between two notes is measured as the number of semitones between them when moving forward in the cycle.\n2. **Major and Minor Chords**: A major chord has distances of 4 and 3 semitones between consecutive notes, while a minor chord has distances of 3 and 4 semitones.\n3. **Permutations of Notes**: Since the order of notes in the triad can vary, we need to check all possible permutations of the three notes to determine if they form a major or minor chord.\n4. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, calculate the distances between consecutive notes and check if they match the criteria for major or minor chords.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_map = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    x_pos = note_map[x]\n    y_pos = note_map[y]\n    z_pos = note_map[z]\n    \n    d1 = (y_pos - x_pos) % 12\n    d2 = (z_pos - y_pos) % 12\n    \n    if d1 + d2 == 7:\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            exit()\n        elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a list of three notes.\n2. **Note Mapping**: Each note is mapped to its position in the cyclic order of musical notes.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible orderings of the three notes are generated.\n4. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated. These distances are checked against the criteria for major and minor chords.\n5. **Output Result**: If a valid major or minor chord is found, the result is printed and the program exits. If no valid chord is found after all permutations, \"strange\" is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the triad are checked efficiently, providing the correct classification based on the given musical theory criteria.",
