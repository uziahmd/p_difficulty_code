She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Luba is trying to close some tabs in her browser. Hmm, let me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo, the setup is that she has n tabs open, from 1 to n. The cursor starts at position pos. She needs to keep the tabs from l to r and close all others. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right, but only within the current available tabs. Or she can close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum number of seconds needed to achieve this.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. It seems like a problem that can be approached with BFS, because we're looking for the shortest path (minimum steps) to reach a certain state. Each state could represent the current position of the cursor and which tabs are still open. But wait, the state space might get too big if we track every possible subset of open tabs. So maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to figure out the order in which to close the tabs. Because once a tab is closed, it affects the possible movement of the cursor. For example, if she closes tabs to the left first, then the right side can't have any tabs beyond the current position.\n\nLet me break down the problem:\n\nShe needs to close all tabs outside [l, r]. So, the initial state is all tabs open (a = 1, b = n). The target state is when the remaining tabs are exactly [l, r], meaning a = l and b = r. The cursor must be somewhere in this range.\n\nSo the steps involve moving the cursor to certain positions and then closing tabs on either side.\n\nI think the optimal approach is to decide whether to close the left side first or the right side, and calculate the minimal steps required for each scenario, then choose the better one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she can close both sides in a certain order, which may take fewer steps than just choosing one side first.\n\nHmm, let's think about the process:\n\nCase 1: Close left first, then right.\n\n- Move to position where she can close left.\n- Close left.\n- Then move to the right side and close right.\n\nCase 2: Close right first, then left.\n\n- Move to position to close right.\n- Close right.\n- Then move to left and close left.\n\nOr, maybe she can do a combination, like close one side, move, close the other, etc.\n\nWait, but after closing one side, the other side's closure might require moving further. So it's not clear which order is better.\n\nAnother idea: The minimal steps would be determined by the sum of steps to move to a position, close one side, then move and close the other.\n\nBut perhaps sometimes it's more efficient to first move to the correct spot to close one side, then the other.\n\nWait, let's consider the first example from the problem statement.\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4\n\nSo, n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nShe needs to end up with tabs 2,3,4.\n\nThe initial a=1, b=6.\n\nShe can do the following:\n\nMove to 2 (costs 1 step), close left (costs 1 step). Now, a=2, b=6.\n\nThen move to 3 (costs 1 step), then to 4 (costs another step). So two moves. Then close right (costs 1 step).\n\nTotal steps: 1 (move to 2) + 1 (close left) + 2 (move to 4) + 1 (close right) = 5 steps.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the steps are: move to close left, then move to the right end and close.\n\nIn this case, the order was to close the left first, then the right.\n\nAnother test case is when she already has the desired tabs. Like the third input: 5 2 1 5. So l=1, r=5, which means no tabs need to be closed. So the answer is 0.\n\nThe second test case: 6 3 1 3.\n\nShe needs to close the right of 3, so the steps are to close right. Since she's at 3, she can close all tabs to the right (tabs 4,5,6), which takes 1 step.\n\nSo, the approach depends on whether she can close a side without needing to move.\n\nSo, the general approach is to compute the minimal steps between several possible strategies.\n\nWhat are the possible strategies?\n\n1. Close the left side first, then the right.\n2. Close the right side first, then the left.\n3. Close both sides, but perhaps in a way that requires moving through both.\n\nWait, but perhaps the best strategy is to compute both options",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment while keeping the tabs within the segment open. The approach involves considering different strategies for closing the tabs and calculating the steps required for each strategy.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Luba can either move the cursor left or right or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor. The goal is to minimize the number of steps required to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The optimal strategy involves either closing the left side first or the right side first, then moving to the opposite side and closing it. We will compute the steps required for both strategies and choose the one with fewer steps.\n\n3. **Steps Calculation**:\n   - **Close Left First**: Move to the position where the left side can be closed, close it, then move to the end of the right segment and close it.\n   - **Close Right First**: Move to the position where the right side can be closed, close it, then move to the start of the left segment and close it.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**: If the initial position is already within the desired segment and no tabs need to be closed, the answer is 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Strategy 1: Close left first, then right\n    # Steps: move to l, close left, then move to r, close right\n    steps1 = abs(pos - l) + 1  # move to l, close left (1 step)\n    steps_right = abs(r - l) + 1  # move from l to r, close right (1 step)\n    total1 = steps1 + steps_right\n\n    # Strategy 2: Close right first, then left\n    # Steps: move to r, close right, then move to l, close left\n    steps2 = abs(pos - r) + 1  # move to r, close right (1 step)\n    steps_left = abs(r - l) + 1  # move from r to l, close left (1 step)\n    total2 = steps2 + steps_left\n\n    # Choose the minimum of the two strategies\n    print(min(total1, total2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution calculates the minimum steps required by considering two strategies:\n1. Closing the left side first and then the right side.\n2. Closing the right side first and then the left side.\n\nFor each strategy, the steps involve moving the cursor to the appropriate position, closing the tabs, and then moving to the opposite side to close the remaining tabs. The solution prints the minimum steps required between the two strategies.",
