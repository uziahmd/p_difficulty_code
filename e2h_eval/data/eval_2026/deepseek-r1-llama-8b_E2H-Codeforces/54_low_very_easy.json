Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a regular polygon, each internal angle can be calculated. The formula for the internal angle of a regular n-gon is (n-2)*180 / n degrees. But wait, that's the internal angle. But when forming an angle with three vertices, how does that translate?\n\nWait, no, the problem is about creating an angle by selecting three points v1, v2, v3. The angle is formed at v2, between the two lines from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. So I need to find the possible angles that can be formed by any triplet of vertices in the polygon.\n\nBut since the polygon is regular, the positions of the vertices are symmetric. So maybe there's a pattern or optimal way to choose these points.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the regular polygon. Each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. The central angle between consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees. So the arc between any two adjacent vertices is 360/n.\n\nWhen you pick three vertices, say v1, v2, v3, they form a triangle. The angle at v2 depends on the arcs subtended by v1 and v3 relative to v2.\n\nWait, in a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So for the angle at v2, the angle formed is equal to half the measure of the arc that's opposite to it, which is the arc from v1 to v3 passing through the points not including v2.\n\nWait, maybe I should draw this. Suppose the polygon is a regular n-gon inscribed in a unit circle. Then the central angle between consecutive vertices is 2π/n radians. So, if I have three points A, B, C, the angle at B is determined by the arcs AB and BC, but wait, no— the angle at B would be determined by the arc AC that doesn't contain B. Because the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.\n\nSo, for example, in a square (n=4), each side corresponds to 90 degrees. If I take points 1, 2, 3: the angle at 2 is 90 degrees because the arc from 1 to 3 is 180 degrees (since it's a semicircle in a square). Half of that is 90, which is the angle.\n\nWait, but in a square, the angle formed by points 1,2,3 is 90 degrees. Similarly, points 2,3,4 also form 90 degrees. But what about other triplets? Like 1,2,4: the angle at 2 would be formed by the arc from 1 to 4, which is 270 degrees (since moving clockwise from 1 to 4 in a square is 3 steps, each 90 degrees: 3*90=270). Wait, but in reality, in a square, the points 1,2,4 form a right angle as well. Hmm, maybe I'm getting something wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. For any triplet of points in the regular polygon, the angle at v2 can be calculated based on the number of edges between v1 and v3 around the polygon. Let's see.\n\nSuppose the polygon has n vertices. The central angle between two consecutive vertices is θ = 360/n degrees. When we pick v1, v2, v3, their positions are at some steps away from each other. Let's denote the positions of the vertices as 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 in a circular manner.\n\nFor a given v2, let's say the positions of v1 and v3 are k steps before and after v2, respectively. Or maybe not exactly before and after, but some steps. Wait, perhaps it's better to model the positions as relative to v2.\n\nAlternatively, for a given v2, the possible angles at v2 can be determined by the steps between v1 and v3. Let's think about the minimal arc between v1 and v3 as seen from v2.\n\nWait, maybe for each vertex v2, I can consider the possible pairs of other vertices (v1, v3) such that the angle formed at v2 is as close as possible to 'a'. Then, among all possible v2, choose the one that gives the minimal difference.\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\n1. For each vertex v2 in the polygon:\n   a. Consider all possible pairs (v1, v3) that are distinct and different from v2.\n   b. For",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The solution leverages the properties of regular polygons and inscribed angles in circles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Polygon Structure**: A regular polygon has vertices equally spaced around a circle. The central angle between consecutive vertices is \\( \\frac{360}{n} \\) degrees.\n2. **Inscribed Angle Theorem**: The angle formed by three vertices (v1, v2, v3) at v2 is half the measure of the arc intercepted by the lines from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. This arc is the minimal path between v1 and v3 that does not include v2.\n3. **Optimal Angle Calculation**: For each vertex v2, consider pairs of other vertices (v1, v3) such that the angle at v2 is minimized in terms of absolute difference from 'a'. This involves checking all possible pairs relative to v2.\n4. **Symmetry and Efficiency**: Given the symmetry of the regular polygon, the closest angle can be found by checking a limited number of steps around each vertex v2, ensuring the solution is efficient even for larger values of n.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\n\ndef find_best_triangle(n, a):\n    best_diff = float('inf')\n    best_tri = None\n\n    for v2 in range(1, n+1):\n        # Check possible pairs around v2\n        for d1 in range(1, n//2 +1):\n            v1 = (v2 -

For each v2, it considers various pairs of other vertices (v1, v3) to form the angle. Using the inscribed angle theorem, it calculates the angle and how close it is to 'a'. It keeps track of the closest angle found and returns the corresponding triplet of vertices. The approach ensures that all possible configurations are checked efficiently within the constraints, providing the optimal solution.",
