    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where Homer and Marge are playing a TV game. The goal is to maximize their total prize by choosing the sequence of moves optimally. Let me try to understand the problem.\n\nThe game starts with a number A that has 2n digits. Each player makes exactly n moves. In each move, the current player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their own number (S1 for Homer and S2 for Marge). Then, that digit is removed from A. So after each move, A gets shorter by one digit.\n\nOur task is to determine the order of moves (Homer and Marge) such that when all moves are done, both have exactly n digits, and their combined scores (the sum of their numbers) is as large as possible.\n\nHmm. So the key is to decide for each digit whether it's assigned to Homer or Marge in a way that maximizes the sum of their numbers. But since the order of taking the digits affects how we can assign them, it's a bit tricky.\n\nLet me think about the process. Each time a player picks the first digit of A, which changes as they take digits. So the sequence of digits taken will determine how the digits are split between the two players.\n\nWait, but the problem allows us to choose any valid sequence of H and M moves. So perhaps the approach is to find a way to partition the digits into two groups of n each, such that the sum of the values of these groups is maximized. But wait, not exactly, because the order in which they are picked affects how the digits are assigned.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal strategy is to greedily assign the largest remaining digit to the player who can contribute more to the sum. Or perhaps, for each digit, the decision depends on whether adding it to Homer's or Marge's number gives a higher overall sum.\n\nWait, but the way the digits are taken is sequential—each step, the next digit is taken from the front. So the assignment isn't arbitrary; it's determined by the order of picking.\n\nSo the problem is similar to a dynamic programming problem where we track the state of A as we go along, and at each step decide whether to take the next digit as H or M.\n\nBut given that n can be up to 18, the total number of digits is 36. So the state would need to represent the current position in the digit string, and how many digits each player has collected so far.\n\nWait, let's model this as a DP problem. Let's say dp[i][h][m] represents the maximum sum achievable when we've processed i digits, and h digits have been assigned to Homer, m to Marge. Since each move alternates between the players, the parity of the number of digits taken so far might matter.\n\nWait, but the order in which the digits are picked determines the assignment. So for each step, the current player is either H or M, depending on whose turn it is.\n\nHmm. So the state could be the index of the current digit we're considering, and the counts of how many digits each player has taken so far. Also, perhaps the current player's turn.\n\nWait, maybe the state should include:\n\n- The current position in the string (like, which digit are we considering next).\n- The number of digits taken by Homer so far.\n- The number of digits taken by Marge so far.\n\nAnd for each state, we can choose whether the next digit is taken by Homer or Marge, depending on whose turn it is. Because the players alternate turns, the next player is determined by the current count of moves made.\n\nWait, but each move is made by either H or M, and they each must make exactly n moves. So the order of turns is fixed: the first move is by one of them (but wait, no— the problem says that before each turn, the players determine who makes the next move. Hmm, that complicates things. Oh, wait no. Wait, the initial description says that \"they managed to know the number A beforehand\" and want to find the sequence of their moves that maximizes their total prize. So they can choose the order of turns (i.e., who goes first, second, etc.) to maximize their total.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. So the order of turns isn't fixed. They can choose any sequence where each makes exactly n moves. For example, if n is 2, the sequence could be H, M, H, M or M, H, M, H, etc. So the problem is to find a permutation of n H's and n M's that is a valid sequence (sum to n each), and when applied to the digits in order, the sum of their numbers is maximized.\n\nBut the way the digits are assigned is dependent on the order of the moves. Because each move takes the first digit of A, the earlier moves influence which digits are available for later moves.\n\nWait, but the actual digits are processed in the order they appear in A. So the sequence of moves (H, M, H, M, ...) corresponds to taking the first digit, then the next, etc., but each time, the next digit is taken from the current A, which has the remaining digits after previous steps.\n\nSo the problem is to choose the order of H and M such that when processing the digits in order, the assignments to H and M result in the maximum sum.\n\nSo perhaps the solution involves finding a way to partition the digits into two sequences (for H and M) such that each sequence is built by selecting the first available digit in order, and the choice of which player takes it (H or M) is decided to maximize the sum.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be approached with dynamic programming. Let's model the state as:\n\n- The current position in the string (i).\n- The number of digits taken by H so far (h).\n- The number of digits taken by M so far (m).\n\nAt each state, we can choose whether the next digit is taken by H or M, provided that neither exceeds n. Then, for each choice, we compute the maximum possible sum and proceed to the next state.\n\nBut since the players can choose the order of turns, the next player can be either H or M, but also constrained by the counts. Wait, no— the next player is determined by the current state. For example, the first move is by either H or M, but once you choose, the next move alternates. Or, no— perhaps the players can choose to switch who goes next. Wait, the problem statement says that \"each player should make exactly n moves.\" So during the entire game, each will make exactly n moves, but the order can be any as long as the total is n for each.\n\nWait, that's not correct. The initial description says: \"Each player should make exactly n moves.\" So during the game, the players will alternate turns, but the order is determined by whom they choose each time. But no— perhaps the order is determined by the players' choices. Hmm, the exact wording is: \"Before each turn players determine who will make the next move.\"\n\nAh, right. So before each turn, the players decide who will make the next move. So the order of turns is flexible. For example, the first move could be H, then M, then H, then M, etc. Or the first could be M, then H, then M, then H, etc. Alternatively, they could choose any pattern, as long as each makes exactly n moves.\n\nThis adds a layer of complexity because the DP needs to track not only the current position and the counts of H and M moves made, but also whose turn it is next.\n\nWait, but wait— perhaps the order in which the moves are made can affect which digits are assigned to whom. For example, if the first move is H, he takes the first digit. Then, the next move could be H again (if they choose), but then M will have to make fewer moves. No, because each must make exactly n moves. So the total number of moves is 2n, and each player must make exactly n.\n\nSo the order of the moves can be any permutation of H and M of length 2n, with exactly n H's and n M's.\n\nBut the key is that the assignment of digits is based on the order of the moves and the current state of A. So for each possible sequence of H and M, the sum is computed, and we need to find the sequence with maximum sum.\n\nBut trying all possible sequences is impossible, as 2n can be up to 36, leading to 2^36 possibilities—way too big.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative idea: the problem can be viewed as assigning each digit to H or M, but with the constraint that exactly n are assigned to each, and that the order of selection (based on the original A) is such that the selection is compatible with the assignment.\n\nWait, but the order of selection matters because the digits are taken in order from A. So the assignment of which player takes which digit depends on the sequence of moves. So the problem is to arrange the H's and M's in a way that, when processing the digits in order, the earliest possible digits are assigned optimally.\n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal way is to assign the largest possible digits to the players as early as possible. But how?\n\nWait, the sum of the numbers is maximized when the digits are arranged in descending order for each player. So the goal is to have both H and M's numbers be as large as possible.\n\nBut the digits are taken in the order of A. So the first digit is taken first, then the next, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into choosing, for each position in the 2n-digit string, whether to assign it to H or M, ensuring that exactly n are assigned to each, and that the assignments are compatible with some order of moves where each move takes the next available digit.\n\nWait, but the assignment must form a valid sequence where the moves don't require looking ahead beyond the current state. So the order in which the digits are taken must match the order of the moves.\n\nFor example, suppose in the assignment, the first digit is assigned to M. Then, in the move sequence, M must make a move at that step. Similarly, if the second digit is assigned to H, then H must have made a move in the second step.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a way to assign each digit to H or M, such that exactly n are assigned to each, and the assignment is possible in a way that the moves are a valid sequence.\n\nThus, the problem is similar to the problem of scheduling jobs with deadlines, where each H and M must pick certain digits in order.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to model this as a dynamic programming problem where we track:\n\n- The current position in the string (i).\n- How many digits have been assigned to H so far (h).\n- How many digits have been assigned to M so far (m).\n\nAnd for each state, we can choose to assign the next digit to H or M, provided that we don't exceed n for either.\n\nBut also, the order in which the digits are assigned must be such that the moves are a valid sequence. Wait, but in this model, the assignment is done in order, so the sequence is determined by the order of the digits. So, for each digit, we decide whether H or M takes it, but the next digit is always the next in the string.\n\nSo, the state transitions would be:\n\nAt position i, with h H digits and m M digits taken so far:\n\n- If we assign the current digit to H, then h+1 <=n, and the next state is i+1, h+1, m.\n- Similarly for M.\n\nBut this ignores the fact that the players can choose the order of turns. For example, in the first move, it's possible to choose either H or M, regardless of the other player's previous moves.\n\nWait, but in the DP approach, the state doesn't track whose turn it is. So that's a problem because the choice of who takes the next digit depends on the previous choices.\n\nWait, perhaps the state needs to include the next player to move. Because after each move, the next player is the other one, unless the players choose otherwise. But wait, no— according to the problem statement, before each turn, the players decide who will make the next move. So they can choose to have the same player make the next move, as long as each ends up making exactly n moves.\n\nWait, but that's a possibility. For example, H could make the first two moves, then M makes n, but wait, each must make exactly n. So the total number of moves is 2n, with each player making exactly n.\n\nWait, perhaps the order of moves can vary widely, and the DP needs to account for the current player's turn.\n\nSo the state would need to include:\n\n- The current position in the string (i).\n- The number of digits assigned to H so far (h).\n- The number of digits assigned to M so far (m).\n- The next player to make a move.\n\nWait, but that's a lot of states. Let's see: 2n is up to 36, n is up to 18, so h and m can each be up to 18. And the next player can be either H or M. So the number of states is 36 * 19 * 19 * 2 = around 140,000, which is manageable.\n\nYes, that's feasible.\n\nSo the DP state is (i, h, m, turn), where turn indicates whose turn it is to take the next digit. The value stored is the maximum sum achievable from that state onwards.\n\nThe base case is when i == 2n, which means all digits are processed. The sum is zero in that case.\n\nFor each state, we can choose to assign the current digit (A[i]) to the current player. Wait, no— the current player can choose to assign it or not? Or wait, no— the current player must take the next digit. Because in each move, the player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their number.\n\nSo for each state (i, h, m, turn), the current player is 'turn', and they must take the digit at position i. So the current digit is A[i], and the player takes it, appending it to their number.\n\nSo the transition is:\n\nIf current player is H:\n\n- Assign the digit to H: add its value to H's sum. Update h +=1, next turn is M (since the next player is the other). So the next state is (i+1, h+1, m, 'M').\n\nSimilarly for M.\n\nWait, but what about the order in which the players choose to take the digits? Because the players can decide the order of turns, but the way the digits are assigned depends on the order of the moves.\n\nSo, for each state, the current player is fixed, and they take the current digit, adding it to their number.\n\nWait, perhaps the DP approach is to consider that the order of the moves is a sequence of H and M's, and for each position, the current player is determined by the sequence up to that point.\n\nBut this may complicate things because the DP state would need to track the sequence, which is not feasible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the DP can model the current player as part of the state, along with the counts of digits taken. So, for each state (i, h, m, turn), the current player is turn, and they must take the current digit, then the next state is (i+1, new_h, new_m, next_turn).\n\nSo, for each state, the current player is forced to take the current digit.\n\nThus, the DP recurrence is:\n\ndp[i][h][m][turn] = max(\n   if turn is H:\n       (digit_value added to H's sum) + dp[i+1][h+1][m][M]\n   else:\n       (digit_value added to M's sum) + dp[i+1][h][m+1][H]\n)\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, the current player must take the current digit. So, for each state, the next state is determined by whether the current player is H or M.\n\nBut since the players can choose the order of turns, the DP must account for all possible sequences of turns that are valid, i.e., sequences where exactly n H's and n M's are present.\n\nBut in this model, the next player is always the other player, because after a move by H, the next must be M, and vice versa. Wait, no— because the problem allows the players to choose who makes the next move. So in the DP model, the next turn could be either player, not necessarily the other.\n\nWait, but that complicates things. Because after a move by H, the next move could be H again, as long as the total H moves don't exceed n.\n\nWait, but that's possible. For example, in a 4-digit scenario (n=2), the sequence could be H, H, M, M. So the first two moves are H, then two Ms.\n\nBut in this case, the first two digits are taken by H, then the next two by M.\n\nIn this case, the DP state must allow for the current player to choose whether to let the next player be the same or the other.\n\nWait, no— the current player chooses who makes the next move. So after a move by H, the next move can be H or M, but in a way that the total H and M moves each reach n.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. So the DP state must include not only the current position and the counts, but also the next player.\n\nBecause, for example, if the current state is (i, h, m, turn), the next move can be taken by either player, as long as it's allowed by the constraints.\n\nWait, but how do we model the possible transitions?\n\nPerhaps the DP state needs to track, for each possible state, the best possible sum, regardless of the order of the next move.\n\nWait, but that's not sufficient because the choice of the next player affects which digits are taken and thus the sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the next player can be chosen as either H or M, but the constraints are that h + new_h ≤n and m + new_m ≤n.\n\nSo for each state (i, h, m, turn), the next move can be taken by either H or M, but the decision affects the next state.\n\nWait, but this may not capture the fact that the players can choose the next player in any way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the DP can model the next player as a separate state, allowing for any possible transitions, as long as the counts don't exceed n.\n\nSo, for each state (i, h, m, turn), the next move can be taken by either H or M, regardless of the current turn.\n\nBut that would lead to a lot of possible transitions, but perhaps it's manageable.\n\nWait, let's think about it. For each state (i, h, m, turn), the current player is 'turn'. But the next player can be either H or M, as the players can choose. So from this state, there are two possible transitions:\n\n1. The next move is taken by H: assign the current digit to H, update h, and next turn is H again (since H can choose to make another move). But wait, no— the next move can be taken by H again only if h < n.\n\nWait, no— the next move is taken by H only if the current player chooses to let H take it. But in the DP approach, perhaps the next player is a choice.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let's try to rephrase the problem.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of 2n moves, each being H or M, with exactly n H's and n M's. The order of the moves determines which digits are assigned to H and M. The sum is the sum of the numbers formed by H and M, which is the sum of the digits taken in the order of their moves.\n\nSo the problem is to choose a subset of n digits for H and the remaining n for M, such that the sum of H's number plus M's number is maximized. But the subset must form a prefix-closed condition— because the digits are taken in order, and each move takes the first available digit.\n\nWait, but the order of the digits is fixed as per A. So for H, the digits assigned must appear in the order they are taken from A. Similarly for M.\n\nThus, the problem is similar to partitioning the 2n digits into two sequences, each of length n, such that:\n\n- Each sequence is a subsequence of A, in the same order as A.\n- The sum of the two sequences is maximized.\n\nBut the challenge is that the two sequences cannot be chosen independently; their union must be the entire string, and each digit is assigned to exactly one of the sequences.\n\nWait, that's an interesting way to look at it. So the problem reduces to finding two interleaving subsequences (H and M) of A, each of length n, such that their sum is maximized.\n\nBut the order in which the digits are taken must follow the order of A. So H's digits must appear in increasing order of their positions in A, and same for M's.\n\nThus, the problem becomes finding two sequences H_digits and M_digits, each of length n, such that:\n\n- The concatenation of H_digits and M_digits is a supersequence of A, meaning that the order of digits in A is preserved within both H_digits and M_digits.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the H_digits and M_digits are both subsequences of A, but the way they are taken is that in each move, the current player takes the next digit from the front of A. So the order of the digits in H_digits and M_digits must be such that they are prefixes of A, but possibly interleaved.\n\nWait, perhaps not. For example, in the sample input, A is '1234'.\n\nSuppose the first move is H, taking '1' for H. Then the next move is M, taking '2' for M. Then H again takes '3', then M takes '4'. So H_digits is [1,3], M_digits is [2,4]. Their sum is 13 + 24 = 37.\n\nAnother possible arrangement is H takes '1', M takes '2', H takes '3', M takes '4'— same as above.\n\nBut in another scenario, suppose H takes '1' and '3', M takes '2' and '4'— same as before.\n\nWait, but the order of H and M moves can affect which digits are taken when. For instance, if H takes '1' first, then M can take '2' next, then H takes '3', then M takes '4'. Alternatively, if M takes '2' first, then H can take '1' later, but that's not possible because the first digit is '1', so M can't take '2' until after H has taken '1'.\n\nWait, no. Because in each move, the player takes the leftmost digit of A. So the first digit is always '1'; it can't be taken by M before H takes it.\n\nSo the initial approach is wrong. The assignment of digits to H and M is determined by the order of moves, and each move takes the next digit in A.\n\nSo, the sequence of H and M moves directly determines which digits are assigned to whom.\n\nSo, the way to model this is that the moves are a permutation of H and M, each appearing exactly n times. The sum of the numbers is computed by concatenating the digits assigned to each player in the order of their moves.\n\nThus, the problem is to find a permutation of H and M of length 2n, with exactly n of each, that when applied to A, results in the maximum sum of the two resulting numbers.\n\nBut how to model this efficiently?\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the sum of the two numbers can be represented as the sum of all the digits, but with each digit multiplied by a certain weight based on its position in their respective numbers.\n\nWait, for example, the first digit assigned to H is the most significant digit in H's number, the second is the next, etc. Similarly for M.\n\nSo the sum is the sum over all digits d_i multiplied by 10^{k} for their position k in their respective number.\n\nThus, the problem is to assign each digit to H or M, such that each gets exactly n digits, and the sum of their contributions is maximized.\n\nBut the order in which the digits are assigned to H and M is determined by the moves.\n\nSo, the problem is similar to arranging the digits into two sequences, each of length n, such that the sum of their values is maximized, and the way the sequences are formed is that in each move, the current player takes the next available digit.\n\nWait, but how do the moves affect the order in which digits are assigned to H and M?\n\nEach move is a choice between H and M, and each choice takes the next digit from A.\n\nThus, the order in which H and M choose digits determines the assignment.\n\nSo, for example, the first move is H: he takes the first digit of A. The next move can be H or M. If it's M, he takes the second digit of A. Otherwise, H takes the second digit.\n\nThus, the sequence of moves directly defines the assignment of digits.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a sequence of 2n moves (H and M) such that each appears exactly n times, and the sum of the numbers formed by the digits assigned to each is maximized.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with dynamic programming, considering the current position in A, the number of digits each player has taken so far, and the current player's turn.\n\nSo, the DP state would be:\n\ndp[i][h][m][current_player] = maximum sum achievable from position i onwards, with h digits taken by H, m by M, and current_player is the one whose turn it is to take the next digit.\n\nThe transitions would be:\n\nFor each state (i, h, m, turn), we can choose to assign the current digit to the current player, and then transition to the next state. But wait, no— the current player must take the current digit. Because each move is a single digit taken from A.\n\nSo, the current player must take the current digit, adding it to their number. Then, the next player is determined by the choices of the players. Wait, but in the DP model, perhaps the next player is a choice.\n\nWait, no— the next player is determined by the current player's choice. Because, after a move by H, the next move can be H again (if he chooses) or M.\n\nBut in the DP, the state must track whose turn it is next. So, for each state, the next player can be H or M, as long as the counts don't exceed n.\n\nWait, but that's not accurate. Because in reality, after a move by H, the next move can be H again (if allowed) or M. So the next player is a choice.\n\nThus, in the DP model, for each state (i, h, m, turn), the next player can be either H or M, as long as the constraints are met.\n\nSo, for each state, we have two options: assign the current digit to the current player, and choose the next player as either H or M, as long as the counts don't exceed n.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely correct. Because the players can choose the next player in any way, as long as the total H and M moves are n each. So, for example, after a move by H, the next move can be H again, but only if h < n. Similarly, after a move by M, the next move can be M again if m < n.\n\nSo, in the DP state, when the current player is H, the next player can be H (if h < n) or M (if m < n). Similarly for M.\n\nWait, but no. Because the players can choose the next player regardless of the current state, as long as the total moves don't exceed n for each.\n\nSo, the next player can be either H or M, but only if the current counts allow.\n\nSo, for the DP transition, from state (i, h, m, turn), the next move can be H or M, but the next player must be such that the counts don't exceed n.\n\nWait, but in the next state, the counts can't exceed n. So, for example, if the current state is (i, h, m, H), the next move can be H only if h < n, or M if m < n.\n\nSo, the transitions are as follows:\n\nIf current player is H:\n\n- If h < n: can choose to have H take the current digit. Then, the next player can be H or M. So, we have two possibilities:\n   a) Next player is H: new state is (i+1, h+1, m, H)\n   b) Next player is M: new state is (i+1, h+1, m, M)\n- Else: can't choose H again, so must choose M as next player.\n\nSimilarly, if current player is M:\n\n- If m < n: can choose to have M take the current digit. Next player can be H or M.\n- Else: must choose H as next player.\n\nWait, but this seems to model the transitions correctly.\n\nThus, the DP recurrence is:\n\nFor state (i, h, m, turn):\n\nif turn is H:\n\n   if h < n:\n\n      option 1: take H, then next player can be H or M.\n\n         sum = current_digit_value * 10^power + dp[i+1][h+1][m][next_turn]\n\n         choose the maximum between the two options.\n\n      option 2: take H, then next player is M.\n\n         sum = current_digit_value * 10^power + dp[i+1][h+1][m][M]\n\n   else:\n\n      must take H, then next player is M.\n\n      sum = current_digit_value * 10^power + dp[i+1][h+1][m][M]\n\nelse:\n\n   if m < n:\n\n      option 1: take M, then next player can be H or M.\n\n         sum = current_digit_value * 10^power + dp[i+1][h][m+1][next_turn]\n\n      option 2: take M, then next player is H.\n\n         sum = current_digit_value * 10^power + dp[i+1][h][m+1][H]\n\n   else:\n\n      must take M, then next player is H.\n\n      sum = current_digit_value * 10^power + dp[i+1][h][m+1][H]\n\nWait, but how do we determine the power for each digit? Because each digit is added as the next digit in the respective player's number. For example, the first digit assigned to H is the most significant, followed by the next, etc. So for H's number, the first digit is multiplied by 10^(n-1), the second by 10^(n-2), and so on. Similarly for M.\n\nWait, yes. So for each player, the digits assigned are in the order they were taken, and each contributes a value based on their position in their number.\n\nThus, the power for the current digit depends on how many digits have been taken by the current player so far.\n\nWait, for example, if the current player is H and has taken h digits so far, then the next digit (h+1-th) for H will be multiplied by 10^(n - (h+1)).\n\nSo, for each state, when a digit is assigned to H, the multiplier is 10^(n - (h+1)). Similarly for M.\n\nThus, the DP needs to track not only the counts of digits taken but also the current position in the digit's significance for each player.\n\nWait, this complicates the state further because now, for each player, we need to know how many digits have been taken so far, to compute the correct multiplier for the next digit.\n\nThus, the state must include h and m, as well as the current player.\n\nBut perhaps the way to model it is that, when assigning a digit to a player, the position in their number is h+1 for H or m+1 for M.\n\nSo, the value contributed by the digit is digit * 10^{(n - (h+1))} for H, or digit * 10^{(n - (m+1))} for M.\n\nThus, in the DP transition, for each state (i, h, m, turn), when the current player takes the digit, the added value is:\n\nif turn is H: digit * 10^{(n - (h + 1))}\nelse: digit * 10^{(n - (m + 1))}\n\nThen, the next state is determined by the next player.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- We precompute the multipliers for each possible h and m for H and M.\n\nBut wait, the exponents can be very large (up to 10^18), but since Python handles big integers, that's manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the digits as a list, converting each character to an integer.\n\n2. Precompute the multipliers for each possible h and m.\n\n   For H: 10^(n - (h+1)), for h from 0 to n-1.\n\n   Similarly for M: 10^(n - (m+1)), for m from 0 to n-1.\n\n3. Initialize the DP table with a 4-dimensional array, but since n can be up to 18, and 2n is 36, it's manageable.\n\n   However, using a dictionary for memoization may be more efficient.\n\n4. Use memoization with the current position i, h, m, and turn.\n\n5. For each state, compute the maximum sum by considering all possible transitions.\n\nNow, considering that the state space is 36 * (n+1) * (n+1) * 2, which for n=18 is 36*19*19*2 = around 140,000 states. For each state, there are up to 2 transitions (if possible), this should be manageable.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Read n and A.\n\n- Convert A into a list of integers, digits.\n\n- Precompute the multipliers for H and M.\n\n- Implement a recursive DP function with memoization.\n\nImplementing this in Python, using lru_cache for memoization.\n\nBut wait, the digits are processed in order, so the function must process them in order. So, the current index i is processed, and the next is i+1.\n\nNow, for the base case: when i == 2n, return 0.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\ndef dp(i, h, m, turn):\n    if i == len(digits):\n        return 0\n    if (i, h, m, turn) in cache:\n        return cache[(i, h, m, turn)]\n    current_digit = digits[i]\n    max_sum = 0\n    if turn == 'H':\n        if h < n:\n            # option 1: next player is H\n            sum1 = current_digit * (10 ** (n - (h + 1))) + dp(i+1, h+1, m, 'H')\n            # option 2: next player is M\n            sum2 = current_digit * (10 ** (n - (h + 1))) + dp(i+1, h+1, m, 'M')\n            max_sum = max(sum1, sum2)\n        else:\n            # can't choose H again, must choose M\n            sum = current_digit * (10 ** (n - (h + 1))) + dp(i+1, h+1, m, 'M')\n            max_sum = sum\n    else:\n        if m < n:\n            # option 1: next player is M\n            sum1 = current_digit * (10 ** (n - (m + 1))) + dp(i+1, h, m+1, 'M')\n            # option 2: next player is H\n            sum2 = current_digit * (10 ** (n - (m + 1))) + dp(i+1, h, m+1, 'H')\n            max_sum = max(sum1, sum2)\n        else:\n            # must choose H\n            sum = current_digit * (10 ** (n - (m + 1))) + dp(i+1, h, m+1, 'H')\n            max_sum = sum\n    cache[(i, h, m, turn)] = max_sum\n    return max_sum\n\nWait, but the initial call would start at i=0, h=0, m=0, and the first player can be either H or M. So the initial state is i=0, h=0, m=0, and the turn is H or M, whichever gives the maximum sum.\n\nWait, but the initial state is that the players can choose who goes first. So, the initial call should be considering both possibilities: starting with H or starting with M.\n\nThus, the initial maximum is the maximum of the two possibilities.\n\nSo, the code should compute dp(0, 0, 0, 'H') and dp(0, 0, 0, 'M'), and take the maximum of the two.\n\nWait, but no— because the initial state is that no moves have been made, and the players can choose the first move. So, the first move can be H or M, and the rest of the moves are determined accordingly.\n\nThus, the initial call is to choose the first player as H or M, whichever leads to a better sum.\n\nSo, the solution is the maximum of dp(0, 0, 0, 'H') and dp(0, 0, 0, 'M').\n\nOnce the maximum sum is found, we need to reconstruct the sequence of moves (H and M) that led to this sum.\n\nReconstruction is another challenge. We need to track, for each state, the choice made (H or M) to reach the maximum sum.\n\nThus, we can modify the DP function to return not only the maximum sum but also the sequence of moves that achieved it.\n\nBut this complicates the implementation, as the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the sequence of moves for Homer and Marge in a TV game such that their total prize is maximized. Each player makes exactly `n` moves, and each move involves taking the leftmost digit of a given number `A`, appending it to their respective numbers, and then removing that digit from `A`.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming (DP). The key idea is to use memoization to track the maximum possible sum achievable at each step, considering the current position in the string, the number of digits taken by each player, and whose turn it is next.\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming State**: We define a state as `(i, h, m, turn)`, where:\n   - `i` is the current position in the string `A`.\n   - `h` is the number of digits taken by Homer.\n   - `m` is the number of digits taken by Marge.\n   - `turn` indicates whose turn it is next.\n\n2. **Transitions**: For each state, we consider the current digit and decide whether to assign it to the current player (Homer or Marge) and transition to the next state. The next player can be either one, provided they haven't exceeded their move limit.\n\n3. **Memoization**: Use memoization to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computations and improve efficiency.\n\n4. **Reconstruction**: After computing the maximum sum, reconstruct the sequence of moves by backtracking through the DP states.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    digits = [int(c) for c in A]\n    len_digits = len(digits)\n\n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(i, h, m, turn):\n        if i == len_digits:\n            return 0\n        current = digits[i]\n        max_val = 0\n        if turn == 'H':\n            if h < n:\n                val_h_next_h = current * (10 ** (n -
