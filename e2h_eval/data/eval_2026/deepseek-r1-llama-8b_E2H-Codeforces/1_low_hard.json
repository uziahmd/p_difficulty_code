    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I calculate the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. Let's see what the problem says.\n\nThe plate is w rows by h columns. We have k rings, and each ring is a border around an inner rectangle. The first ring is the outermost edge, the second is two cells in, and so on. Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\nHmm, how do I model each ring? For each ring i (starting from 1), the dimensions of the rectangle are (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h -4*(i-1)). Wait, because each ring reduces both the width and height by 4 for the next one. Because for each ring, we lose a cell on each side, so two cells on each dimension (left and right, top and bottom) which is 2*2=4 subtracted each time.\n\nSo for each ring i from 1 to k, I need to compute the perimeter of that rectangle, but making sure that if the rectangle becomes too small, it doesn't contribute anything.\n\nWait, wait. The perimeter formula: for a rectangle with width W and height H, the number of cells along the perimeter is 2*(W + H) -4. Because each corner is counted twice if I just add W and H. So subtracting 4 corrects that.\n\nBut wait, for a 3x3 grid, the perimeter is 8. Let me check: 3+3 gives 6, multiplied by 2 is 12, minus 4 is 8. Yep, that works.\n\nSo for each ring i, the current W is w - 4*(i-1). Similarly for H.\n\nBut wait, what if after some i, the W or H becomes less than 3? Because each ring requires at least a 3x3 rectangle. So, for example, when i is such that w -4*(i-1) <3 or h-4*(i-1) <3, that ring can't exist. So I should only consider up to the maximum possible k where all rings fit.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, k is given such that it won't exceed the maximum possible. So maybe I don't have to worry about that. So I can proceed under the assumption that for each i up to k, the dimensions are valid.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each ring from 1 to k:\n   a. Compute current_w = w -4*(i-1)\n   b. Compute current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n   c. Compute perimeter as 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n   d. Sum all perimeters across all k rings.\n\nSo the total is the sum from i=1 to k of (2*(w_i + h_i) -4), where w_i = w -4*(i-1), etc.\n\nLet me test this with the examples given.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1.\n\nFor i=1:\ncurrent_w=3, current_h=3.\nperimeter = 2*(3+3) -4 = 12-4=8. So output is 8. Which matches.\n\nSecond example:7 9 1.\n\ni=1:\nw=7, h=9.\nPerimeter: 2*(7+9) -4=32-4=28. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird example:7 9 2.\n\ni=1: 7+9=16*2=32-4=28.\ni=2: 7-4=3, 9-4=5. 3+5=8*2=16-4=12.\nTotal 28+12=40. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the logic seems correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total =0\n\nFor i in 1..k:\n\n   current_w = w -4*(i-1)\n\n   current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\n   if current_w <3 or current_h <3:\n\n       break? Or since k is given correctly, perhaps not needed.\n\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\n   total += perimeter\n\nPrint total.\n\nSo the code in Python would be something like:\n\nRead the input line, split into w, h, k.\n\nConvert to integers.\n\ntotal =0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    w_i = w -4*(i-1)\n\n    h_i = h -4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(w_i + h_i) -4\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, let me see. What about cases where w and h are even?\n\nWait, for example, w=5, h=5, k=1: 5",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is a border around an inner rectangle, and each subsequent ring is placed two cells inward from the previous one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each ring forms a perimeter around a rectangle that is progressively smaller by 4 cells in both width and height for each subsequent ring. The perimeter of a rectangle with width `W` and height `H` can be calculated using the formula `2 * (W + H) - 4`, which accounts for the four corners being counted twice if we simply sum the width and height.\n2. **Iterative Calculation**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the current dimensions of the rectangle, then calculate the perimeter. Sum these perimeters to get the total number of gilded cells.\n3. **Edge Cases**: Ensure that the dimensions remain valid (at least 3x3) for each ring, but since the input constraints guarantee valid `k`, we don't need additional checks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k`.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the current width and height of the rectangle.\n3. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each rectangle, compute its perimeter using the formula `2 * (width + height) - 4`.\n4. **Summing Perimeters**: Accumulate the perimeters of all rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n5. **Output Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
