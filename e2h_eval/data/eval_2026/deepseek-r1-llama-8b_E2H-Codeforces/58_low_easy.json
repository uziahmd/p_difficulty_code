You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vitaly and a graph theory problem. We need to find the minimum number of edges to add to form a simple cycle of odd length (with more than one vertex) and also count the number of ways to do that.\n\nHmm. So the graph is undirected, has n vertices and m edges. No loops or parallel edges. It's not necessarily connected. The task is to compute t and w, where t is the minimal edges needed, and w is the count of ways to achieve that.\n\nWait, the cycle must be simple, meaning each vertex appears at most once. So the cycle is a closed path with no repeated vertices except the starting/ending one.\n\nLet me think about what conditions allow us to form such a cycle.\n\nFirst, for any graph, if there exists a cycle, then adding zero edges might suffice. But since we're looking for an odd-length cycle, perhaps the graph doesn't have any such cycles already, so we need to add edges.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Determine whether the graph already contains an odd-length cycle. If yes, then t is 0, w is 1 (since we can choose any existing cycle).\n2. If not, find the minimal number of edges to add to create such a cycle. Then count how many ways this can be done.\n\nBut wait, the problem says 'simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex'. So the minimal cycle is of length 3.\n\nWait, but in a disconnected graph, perhaps each component can contribute. Hmm, but the overall cycle could span multiple components? Or maybe it's sufficient to look within each connected component.\n\nWait, no. Because adding edges between components can create a longer cycle, but perhaps that's necessary for creating an odd-length cycle.\n\nWait, no. For example, two separate triangles (each a cycle of length 3) in a graph. Adding no edges is needed because each is a triangle, which is an odd cycle. But if the graph doesn't have any cycles, then we have to connect components in a way that forms a cycle.\n\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let's check if the graph already has an odd cycle. If yes, output t=0 and w=1.\n\nOtherwise, we need to compute the minimal edges to add.\n\nWait, but even if the graph has no odd cycles, perhaps it's possible to form one by adding edges.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Check if the graph has any cycles. If it doesn't, then we can't form any cycle without adding edges. So the minimal t is the minimal number of edges needed to form a cycle, which would be 1 (if the graph is a tree), but wait, trees can't have cycles. Wait, no. Wait, a tree is a connected acyclic graph. So for a tree, the minimal way to create a cycle is to add one edge between two nodes that are in the same connected component after adding. Wait, no, a tree is a single connected component. So adding one edge would create exactly one cycle. The length of the cycle depends on the distance between the two nodes you connect.\n\nWait, but in a tree, all cycles formed by adding one edge will have a length equal to the number of edges in the path between the two nodes plus one (the added edge). So for example, if two nodes are at a distance of 2, adding an edge between them creates a cycle of length 3.\n\nSo, for a tree, adding one edge can create a cycle of length 3. So in that case, t=1.\n\nBut wait, the problem requires the cycle to be of odd length. So if the original graph has no cycles, but adding one edge can create a cycle of odd length, then t=1. Otherwise, like if adding one edge creates a cycle of even length, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, but how can adding one edge create a cycle of even length?\n\nFor example, in a straight line of four nodes: 1-2-3-4. Adding an edge between 1 and 3 would create a cycle of length 3 (1-2-3-1). So that's odd.\n\nAnother example: a line of five nodes. Adding an edge between 1 and 4: the path is 1-2-3-4-5, but adding 1-4 would create a cycle 1-2-3-4-1, which is length 4. Oh, right! So that's even. So in this case, adding one edge can create a cycle of even length, which is invalid.\n\nHmm. So in such cases, we can't use that particular edge addition. So the minimal t might be higher.\n\nWait, but in this case, the initial graph is a tree, so adding one edge will create exactly one",

The graph is undirected, has no loops or parallel edges, and may not be connected.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Odd Cycle**: First, check if the graph already contains an odd-length cycle. If it does, the answer is `t=0` and `w=1` since no additional edges are needed.\n2. **Graph Connectivity Check**: If the graph is disconnected, each connected component must be considered separately.\n3. **Determine Minimum Edges for Cycle**: If there are no existing odd cycles, compute the minimum number of edges required to form such a cycle. This involves checking each connected component and determining if it can form an odd cycle by adding edges.\n4. **Count Ways to Form Cycle**: Calculate the number of ways to add the minimum edges to form an odd cycle by considering all possible edges that can create such a cycle.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        v = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    # Function to check if the graph has an odd cycle using BFS and coloring\n    def has_odd_cycle():\n        color = [-1]*(n+1)\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            if color[i] == -1:\n                q = deque()\n                q.append(i)\n                color[i] = 0\n                while q:\n                    u = q.popleft()\n                    for v in adj[u]:\n                        if color[v] == -1:\n                            color[v] = color[u] ^ 1\n                            q.append(v)\n                        elif color[v] == color[u]:\n                            return True\n        return False\n\n    if has_odd_cycle():\n        print(\"0 1\")\n        return\n\n    # Now, the graph has no odd cycle;

Find a single component that is a tree with diameter even, so adding one edge can create an odd cycle. In this case, t=1, and w is the number of such edges.\n\n                # 2. If no such component exists, then we need to connect two or more components in a way that forms an odd cycle. For example, if we have two trees, each with a certain structure, connecting them appropriately can create an odd cycle. In this case, t=2, and w depends on the number of ways to connect the components.\n\n                # So, in our code, after checking each component, if none can form an odd cycle by adding one edge, then we need to look for pairs of components that can be connected to form an odd cycle.\n\n                # But this is getting complicated. Let's think about the sample input.\n\n                # Sample Input 1:\n                # 4 4\n                # 1 2\n                # 1 3\n                # 4 2\n                # 4 3\n                # The graph is a square, which is a cycle of length 4 (even). So no odd cycle exists. The minimal t is 1. Because adding an edge between 2 and 4 would create a triangle (1-2-4-1?), wait no. Wait, original edges are 1-2, 1-3, 4-2, 4-3. So the graph is two triangles: 1-2-4 and 1-3-4. Wait, no, it's a square. So the graph is a cycle of length 4. So to create a triangle, we can add edge 2-3. That would make a cycle 1-2-3-1, which is a triangle. So t=1, w=2 (since adding 2-3 or 1-4 could do it? Wait, adding 1-4 would create a cycle 1-4-2-1, which is a triangle. So in the sample, adding either 2-3 or 1-4 would create a triangle. So w=2.\n\n                # So in this case, the minimal t is 1, and w is 2.\n\n                # So, the approach is to find all possible edges that, when added, create an odd cycle, and select the minimal t among them. Then, count how many such edges exist.\n\n                # However, this is computationally expensive for large graphs. Therefore, an efficient approach is needed.\n\n                # Another idea: The minimal t is 1 if there exists a pair of nodes in the same component at even distance. Otherwise, t is 2, and the number of ways depends on the number of components that can form a cycle when connected.\n\n                # So, for each component, compute the maximum distance between any two nodes. If any component has a maximum distance that is even, then adding one edge can create an odd cycle.\n\n                # So, in the code, for each component, compute the maximum distance between any two nodes. If the maximum distance is even, then there exists a pair of nodes that can form an odd cycle when connected by an edge. So, t=1, and the number of such edges is the number of such pairs.\n\n                # If no component has an even maximum distance, then we need to connect two components. The minimal t is 2, and the number of ways is the number of ways to connect two components such that their combined structure forms an odd cycle.\n\n                # So, the steps are:\n\n                # 1. Check if any component has an even diameter. If yes, t=1, w is the count of such edges.\n                # 2. Else, check if there are at least two components. If not, it's impossible to form a cycle (since a single component is a tree without an odd cycle, and you can't form a cycle with zero or one component).\n                # 3.

If it does, it outputs `0 1`. If not, it examines each connected component to determine if it can form an odd cycle by adding one edge. If any component can, it sets the minimum number of edges (`t`) to 1 and counts the number of ways (`w`). If no such component exists, it checks if there are at least two components and determines the minimum edges required to form an odd cycle by connecting them, setting `t` to 2 and `w` accordingly.",

For example, if we have two trees, each with a certain structure, connecting them appropriately can create an odd cycle. In this case, t=2, and w depends on the number of ways to connect the components.\n\n                # So, in our code, after checking each component, if none can form an odd cycle by adding one edge, then we need to look for pairs of components that can be connected to form an odd cycle.\n\n                # But this is getting complicated.

So no odd cycle exists. The minimal t is 1. Because adding an edge between 2 and 4 would create a triangle (1-2-4-1?), wait no. Wait, original edges are 1-2, 1-3, 4-2, 4-3. So the graph is two triangles: 1-2-4 and 1-3-4. Wait, no, it's a square. So the graph is a cycle of length 4. So to create a triangle, we can add edge 2-3. That would make a cycle 1-2-3-1, which is a triangle. So t=1, w=2 (since adding 2-3 or 1-4 could do it? Wait, adding 1-4 would create a cycle 1-4-2-1, which is a triangle. So in the sample, adding either 2-3 or 1-4 would create a triangle. So w=2.\n\n                # So in this case, the minimal t is 1, and w is 2.\n\n                # So, the approach is to find all possible edges that, when added, create an odd cycle, and select the minimal t among them. Then, count how many such edges exist.\n\n                # However, this is computationally expensive for large graphs.
