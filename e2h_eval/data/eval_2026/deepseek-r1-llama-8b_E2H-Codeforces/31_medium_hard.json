Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Vanya found some cards, and he needs to find the minimum number of additional cards to make the total sum zero. The cards can have any integer from -x to x, but each new card must be within that range.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. The problem is about finding the minimal number of cards needed such that when you add them to the existing sum, the total becomes zero. So, the initial sum is S. Then, we need to find a subset of numbers (each between -x and x) that when added together gives a value of -S, and the count of these numbers is as small as possible.\n\nWait, right. So the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the current sum S of the found cards.\n2. We need to find a collection of new cards with values between -x and x (inclusive) such that their sum is -S.\n3. The goal is to minimize the number of cards in this collection.\n\nSo, what's the strategy here? Well, the minimal number of cards would depend on the absolute value of the required sum (-S). Because each card can contribute at most x towards reducing the deficit or surplus.\n\nLet me think: For example, if the required sum is 5, and each card can contribute up to x=3, then the minimal number is 2 (3+2). But wait, no, because 5 can't be achieved with two cards each contributing maximum 3. Wait, 3 + 3 is 6, which is more than 5. But maybe that's not the case. Wait, no: 3 + 2 is 5, but 2 is allowed only if it's within x.\n\nWait, in any case, for the required sum T (which is -S), the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of |T| / x. But wait, that's not always correct because sometimes you can have a remainder.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nIf T is positive, each card can contribute up to x. So the minimal number of cards is ceil(T / x). Because each card can add as much as possible, but the last one might need to be smaller.\n\nBut wait, suppose T is 4 and x is 3. Then you need two cards: 3 and 1, but wait, 1 is allowed because it's <= x. Or can you use 3 and 1, but 1 is within the limit.\n\nWait, but the maximum is x, so you can choose any number between -x and x. So, for T=4 and x=3, the minimal number is 2, since 3+1=4. Similarly, for T=5 and x=3, you need two cards: 3 and 2.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's take T=5, x=3. 5/3 is 1.666, so ceiling is 2. That works. So the general formula is the ceiling of |T| divided by x.\n\nBut wait, what about T=0? Then no cards are needed, but that's a trivial case.\n\nWait, but what if the required sum is negative? Like T is -5 and x is 3. Then the minimal number is also 2, using -3 and -2.\n\nSo, the minimal number of cards is the minimal k such that k >= |T|, and k * x >= |T|. So, k = ceil(|T| / x).\n\nBut wait, what if |T| is zero? Then k is zero.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Compute the sum S of the given cards.\n- The target is T = -S.\n- The minimal number of cards is the smallest k such that k * x >= |T|, provided that |T| is non-zero. If |T| is zero, then k is zero.\n\nWait, but wait. What about when |T| is less than x? For example, |T|=2 and x=3. Then k=1, because one card can give 2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n1. Calculate S = sum of the found cards.\n2. Compute T = -S.\n3. If T is zero, output 0.\n4. Else, compute the absolute value of T, say abs_T.\n5. The minimal number of cards is ceil(abs_T / x).\n6. However, there's an exception: if abs_T is zero, return 0.\n\nWait, but let's test this against the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n3 2\n-1 1 2\n\nSum is 2. So T is -2. abs_T is 2.\n\nx is 2. So 2/2=1, so minimal is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example input:\n\n2 3\n-2 -2\n\nSum is -4. T is 4.\n\nabs_T is 4, x is 3. 4/3 is approx 1.333, so ceiling is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, x=5, and the card is 3. Sum is 3. T is -3. So 3/5 is 0.6, ceiling is 1. So one card with -3.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, x=2, card is 3. Wait, no, because the problem states that the cards do not exceed x in absolute value. So that case isn't possible.\n\nWait, but another test case: T is 5, x=2. 5/2=2.5, ceiling is 3. So three cards: 2+2+1=5. Each card is within x=2? No, 1 is within 2. So yes, that's acceptable.\n\nSo, seems like the formula holds.\n\nBut wait, what if T is zero? Then no cards needed.\n\nWhat if the sum S is already zero? Then T is zero, so output 0.\n\nWhat if S is zero but x is not zero? It still outputs zero.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCompute sum S of the given cards.\n\nCompute T = -S.\n\nIf T is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, compute abs_T = absolute value of T.\n\nCompute minimal k as ceil(abs_T / x).\n\nBut wait, let's think about when T is zero. Suppose the sum is zero, but maybe some cards are missing. Like n=2, x=5, and the cards are 2 and -2. Sum is zero, so T is zero. So no cards needed.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the question says: \"the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero.\" So if the sum is already zero, the answer is zero.\n\nOtherwise, compute the minimal k.\n\nSo, the code steps are:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of integers.\n\nCompute sum_S = sum(list).\n\nCompute T = -sum_S.\n\nIf T == 0: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nabs_T = abs(T)\n\nk = (abs_T + x - 1) // x  # this is equivalent to ceiling division.\n\nprint(k)\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nIn Python, to compute ceiling(a / b), we can do (a + b -1 ) // b.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's look at the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, x=2.\n\ncards: -1,1,2. Sum is 2. T=-2. abs_T=2. 2/2=1. So output 1.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, x=3.\n\ncards: -2,-2. sum is -4. T=4. 4/3 is 1.333, ceiling is 2. Output 2.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, x=5, card is 0. sum is 0. So T is 0. Output 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=0? Wait, no, because n is given as 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000.\n\nSo, in the code, read n and x.\n\nThen read the list of n integers.\n\nSum them.\n\nCompute T.\n\nIf T is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, compute the minimal k.\n\nSo, the code is simple.\n\nWait, but why in the second sample, it's not possible to find a single card with 4? Because x is 3, so 4 is beyond the allowed x. So the maximum per card is 3. So, with x=3, you can't have a card with 4. So the minimal is 2: 3 and 1, but wait, 3+1=4, but 1 is allowed as it's ≤3.\n\nWait, but wait, 3+1 is 4, but 1 is allowed. So, yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nBut wait, what about when T is zero? Like n=2, x=5, and the cards are 2 and -2. Sum is zero. So no cards needed.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: T is 5, x=5. Then k=1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: T is 6, x=5. Then k=2.\n\nBecause 5+1=6, but 1 is allowed as x=5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, time to write the Python code.\n\nWe'll read the input, process the sum, compute T, etc.\n\nThe input comes as two lines. First line is n and x. Second line is the list of numbers.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_S = sum(cards)\nT = -sum_S\nif T == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    abs_T = abs(T)\n    k = (abs_T + x -1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but wait. What if x is zero? Oh, but according to the problem statement, x is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nSo, that's the code.\n\nTesting it on the samples:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput line 1: 3 2\n\nLine 2: -1 1 2\n\nSum is 2. T is -2. abs_T is 2. 2/2=1. Output 1.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput line 1: 2 3\n\nLine 2: -2 -2\n\nSum is -4. T is 4. 4/3 is 1.333, so ceiling is 2. Output 2.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, x=5, card is 3. Sum is 3. T is -3. abs_T=3. 3/5=0.6, ceiling is 1. So output 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, x=2, card is 0. Sum is 0. T is 0. Output 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, x=5. Cards are 5 and -5. Sum is 0. Output 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, x=5. Cards are 5 and 5. Sum is 10. T is -10. abs_T=10. 10/5=2. Output 2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think that covers all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards (found and additional) equals zero. Each card can have an integer value between -x and x (inclusive).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: Compute the sum of the values on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Target Sum**: The target sum is the negative of the current sum. This is because we need the total sum to be zero, so if the current sum is S, we need an additional sum of -S.\n3. **Check for Zero Target Sum**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Cards Needed**: If the target sum is non-zero, compute the absolute value of the target sum. The minimum number of cards required is the ceiling of the division of this absolute value by x. This is because each card can contribute at most x towards reducing the deficit or surplus.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_S = sum(cards)\nT = -sum_S\n\nif T == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    abs_T = abs(T)\n    k = (abs_T + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of found cards `n` and the maximum absolute value `x` of any card. It then reads the list of integers representing the values on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed.\n3. **Target Sum Calculation**: The target sum `T` is calculated as the negative of the found sum.\n4. **Zero Check**: If the target sum is zero, the output is zero because no additional cards are needed.\n5. **Ceiling Division**: For a non-zero target sum, the absolute value is used. The minimum number of cards required is determined using ceiling division, which is efficiently computed using integer arithmetic as `(abs_T + x - 1) // x`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the minimal number of additional cards efficiently and correctly.",
