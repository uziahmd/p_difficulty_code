    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I calculate the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. Let's see what the problem says.\n\nThe plate is w rows by h columns. We have k rings, and each ring is a border around an inner rectangle. The first ring is the outermost edge, the second is two cells in, and so on. Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\nHmm, how do I model each ring? For each ring i (starting from 1), the dimensions of the rectangle are (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h -4*(i-1)). Wait, because each ring reduces both the width and height by 4 for the next one. Because for each ring, we lose a cell on each side, so two cells on each dimension (left and right, top and bottom) which is 2*2=4 subtracted each time.\n\nSo for each ring i from 1 to k, I need to compute the perimeter of that rectangle, but making sure not to double count the corners.\n\nWait, wait. How to calculate the number of cells in a ring. Let's think about it. For a rectangle of size a x b, the perimeter is 2*(a + b - 2). Because each side contributes a or b cells, but the four corners are counted once each, so subtracting 4 and adding them back once as 4*(1) would give 2a + 2b - 4 = 2(a + b - 2).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each ring, the number of cells is 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2), where current_w is w - 4*(i-1) and current_h is h -4*(i-1). But wait, only if current_w and current_h are at least 3, otherwise the ring can't exist. But since k is given such that it doesn't exceed the maximum possible, we don't need to worry about invalid cases.\n\nSo the plan is: for each i from 1 to k, compute the perimeter as 2*( (w -4*(i-1)) + (h -4*(i-1)) - 2 ). Sum all these perimeters for each i.\n\nLet me test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example:\nInput: 3 3 1\nFor i=1: w=3, h=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*(4) =8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example:\n7 9 1.\nPerimeter is 2*(7+9-2)=2*14=28. Correct.\n\nThird example:\n7 9 2.\ni=1: same as before, 28.\ni=2: current_w=7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5. So 2*(3+5-2)=2*6=12. Total 28+12=40. Which matches.\n\nAnother test case: let's say w=5, h=5, k=2.\ni=1: 5x5 → 2*(5+5-2)=16.\ni=2: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. Wait, but 1x1 is a single cell. Oh wait, no. Because when you subtract 4*(i-1) for i=2, you get 5-4=1. So the rectangle is 1x1, which is just a single cell. But according to the formula, it's 2*(1+1-2)=0. So the total is 16+0=16.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct. Because a 1x1 rectangle doesn't form a ring. So perhaps my formula isn't handling that correctly.\n\nWait, maybe the formula works only when the rectangle is valid. Like, when the current_w and current_h are >=3. Otherwise, the ring doesn't contribute anything.\n\nSo for each i, we need to check if the current_w and current_h are >=3. If not, the ring doesn't add any cells.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, k is chosen such that it doesn't exceed the maximum possible. So for each i up to k, the current_w and current_h must be >=3?\n\nWait, the input constraints say that k is at most floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ), so perhaps for the given k, all the rings up to k are valid.\n\nWait, let's see. Let's take min(w, h) as m. Then max possible rings is (m+1)//4. So for example, if m is 5, (5+1)/4=1.5 → floor is 1. So for m=5, you can have one ring.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is a border around an inner rectangle, and each subsequent ring is placed two cells inward from the previous one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each ring is a border around a rectangle, and each subsequent ring reduces both the width and height of the rectangle by 4 cells (2 cells on each side). The number of cells in each ring can be calculated using the perimeter of the rectangle it forms.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For a rectangle with dimensions `a x b`, the number of cells in its perimeter is given by `2 * (a + b - 2)`. This formula accounts for all the cells along the border without double-counting the corners.\n3. **Iterative Summation**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the perimeter of the corresponding rectangle and sum these values to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    if current_w < 3 or current_h < 3:\n        continue\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k`.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring `i` from 1 to `k`, calculate the current dimensions of the rectangle after accounting for the reduction due to the previous rings.\n3. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each valid rectangle (with dimensions at least 3x3), compute the perimeter and add it to the total count of gilded cells.\n4. **Output the Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells after processing all `k` rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring correctness and handling edge cases appropriately.",
