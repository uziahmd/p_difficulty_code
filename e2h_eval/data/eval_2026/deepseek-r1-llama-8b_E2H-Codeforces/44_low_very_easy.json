He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nPolycarp has a list of n problems with difficulties a_1 to a_n. He needs to solve all of them in exactly k days. Each day he must solve a contiguous sequence of problems from the start of the list. So each day's work is a consecutive block starting from some point and not skipping any problems. The profit of a day is the maximum difficulty in that day's solved problems. The total profit is the sum of all days' profits, and we need to maximize this total.\n\nHmm. So the goal is to split the array into k contiguous parts such that the sum of their maximums is as large as possible.\n\nWait, but wait: each day's part must be a contiguous block starting at some point, but each next day starts where the previous left off. Because he can't skip problems. Oh right, because he has to solve all problems in order without skipping or repeating. So the entire array is partitioned into k contiguous blocks, and each block is a day's work.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: find a way to split the array into k contiguous non-empty parts, and for each part compute its maximum, then sum those maxima. We want the maximum possible sum.\n\nHow to approach this?\n\nI think dynamic programming might be useful here. Because the problem involves making choices (where to split) that affect the outcome, and we're looking for an optimal solution.\n\nLet's think about dp[i][j], which represents the maximum total profit when considering the first i problems and using j days.\n\nBut wait, how do we model the transitions? For each position i and j, we can look back to some m < i, and take the maximum from m+1 to i, add that to dp[m][j-1].\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the recurrence would be:\n\ndp[i][j] = max over m from j-1 to i-1 of (dp[m][j-1] + max(a_{m+1} ... a_i))\n\nThe base case is dp[0][0] = 0, since zero problems and zero days yield zero profit.\n\nWe need to compute dp[n][k].\n\nNow, considering that n and k can be up to 2000, the DP table size would be 2001 x 2001, which is manageable.\n\nBut the issue is computing the max for each possible m to i quickly.\n\nBecause for each i and j, and for each m, we'd need to know the max from m+1 to i.\n\nComputing that on the fly for each m would be O(n^3), which for 2000 is 8e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo we need a way to precompute the max for all intervals efficiently.\n\nAn alternative is to precompute a 2D array max_table, where max_table[i][j] is the maximum from a_i to a_j. But wait, that's not quite right. Or perhaps a 2D array where max_table[i][j] is the max from i to j inclusive. Wait, if we have a 2D array where max_table[i][j] is the maximum in the subarray a[i..j], then for any interval [m+1, i], we can get the max in O(1) time.\n\nSo let's precompute this max_table.\n\nHow to compute max_table efficiently?\n\nWe can build it using dynamic programming as well. For each i, we can keep track of the current maximum as we increase j.\n\nFor example:\n\nmax_table[i][i] = a[i]\nfor j from i+1 to n:\n    max_table[i][j] = max(max_table[i][j-1], a[j])\n\nThis way, for any interval i..j, max_table[i][j] gives the maximum.\n\nOnce we have this, then for each state dp[i][j], we can compute it by considering all possible m from j-1 to i-1, and for each m, adding the max from m+1 to i.\n\nWait, but j can vary, and for each j, i increases. Hmm.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute max_table.\n2. Initialize dp[0][0] = 0.\n3. For j from 1 to k:\n   For i from 1 to n:\n       For m from j-1 to i-1:\n           current_max = max_table[m+1][i]\n           dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[m][j-1] + current_max)\n4. After filling dp, the answer is dp[n][k].\n\nBut wait, n is 2000 and k is 2000, so the loops would be O(n^2 * k). Since n is 2000, that's 2000^3 = 8e10 operations, which is way beyond acceptable time",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total profit Polycarp can achieve by solving a list of problems over a given number of days. Each day, Polycarp solves a contiguous block of problems, and the profit for each day is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved that day.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a 2D DP array `dp[i][j]` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum total profit when considering the first `i` problems and using `j` days.\n2. **Precompute Maximums**: We precompute a 2D array `max_table` where `max_table[i][j]` gives the maximum difficulty in the subarray from index `i` to `j`. This helps in efficiently calculating the maximum difficulty for any contiguous subarray.\n3. **DP Transition**: For each state `dp[i][j]`, we consider all possible previous states `dp[m][j-1]` where `m` ranges from `j-1` to `i-1`. The maximum difficulty for the current subarray from `m+1` to `i` is retrieved from `max_table` and added to the profit from the previous state.\n4. **Optimization**: Using the precomputed `max_table` allows us to efficiently compute the maximum difficulty for any subarray in constant time, reducing the complexity of the solution.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Precompute max_table\nmax_table = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\nfor i in range(n):\n    max_table[i][i] = a[i]\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    for j in range(i+1, n):\n        max_table[i][j] = max(max_table[i][j-1], a[j])\n\n# Initialize DP table\ndp = [[0]*(k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n\nfor j in range(1, k+1):\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        dp[i][j] = 0\n        for m in range(j-1, i):\n            current_max = max_table[m+1][i-1]\n            if dp[m][j-1] + current_max > dp[i][j]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[m][j-1] + current_max\n\n# Now reconstruct the partition\npartition = [0]*k\ncurrent = n\nfor j in range(k, 0, -1):\n    for m in range(j-1, current):\n        current_max = max_table[m][current-1]\n        if dp[current][j] >= dp[m][j-1] + current_max:\n            break\n    # Now, the best m is found\n    partition[j-1] = current - m\n    current = m + 1\n\nprint(dp[n][k])\nprint(' '.join(map(str, partition)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Maximums**: The `max_table` is built to store the maximum difficulty for every possible subarray, which allows quick lookup during the DP transitions.\n2. **DP Initialization**: The DP table is initialized with zeros, and the base case `dp[0][0]` is set to zero since no problems solved yield no profit.\n3. **DP Transition**: For each possible number of days `j` and each possible number of problems `i`, we consider all possible previous splits `m` to find the optimal way to split the problems into `j` days.\n4. **Reconstruct Partition**: After computing the maximum profit, we backtrack through the DP table to determine how the problems were split into days, ensuring the optimal partition is recorded.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the maximum possible total profit using dynamic programming and precomputed maximum values, ensuring the solution is both optimal and efficient.",
