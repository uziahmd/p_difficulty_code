    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it step by step. \n\nThe problem is about counting the number of arrays of sets that satisfy certain conditions. Let's see what the problem says.\n\nWe have to find the number of different arrays containing N sets S_1, S_2, ..., S_N. Each set can contain zero or more different integers from 1 to K. The main condition is that there exists a rearrangement of these sets into S'_1, S'_2, ..., S'_N such that for each i, S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}. \n\nWhat's a child? Oh right, a set A is a child of B if for every x in A, there's an x+1 in B. So, for example, if A has {1}, then B must have at least {2}. If A has {2}, B must have {3}, etc. But wait, no, it's for all elements in A. So if A has multiple elements, each of their next numbers must be present in B.\n\nSo, the array of sets needs to be such that they can be arranged in a chain where each set is a child of the next. And we need to count all possible such arrays, considering the sets as different based on their elements.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, perhaps it's useful to model the problem in terms of the structure of the sets when arranged in some order. Since the arrangement matters, but the order can be chosen optimally, maybe we can model the sets in a way that captures their 'parent' relationship.\n\nWait, but since the order can be rearranged, the problem reduces to finding the number of sequences of sets where each consecutive pair in some permutation satisfies the parent-child condition. But that might not directly help. Alternatively, perhaps we can model this by considering the sets as nodes in a DAG, where an edge from A to B means A is a child of B. Then the problem becomes counting the number of topological orders of a certain DAG structure. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed by considering the maximal possible elements in each set. Because for a set to be a child of another, it must be contained in a certain way. Wait, maybe not.\n\nLet me think about the properties that the sets in the array must satisfy. When the sets are arranged in some order S_1', S_2', ..., S_N', each S_i' must be a child of S_{i+1}'. So, for each i, S_i' is a subset in some way of S_{i+1}'s elements, but not exactly because the definition is about the presence of x+1 for each x in S_i'. \n\nWait, no. For example, S_i' could be {1, 3}, and S_{i+1}' could be {2,3}. Then, does S_i' being a child of S_{i+1}' hold? Let's see: for each x in S_i', x+1 must be in S_{i+1}'. So for 1, yes (2 is present). For 3, yes (4 is not present in S_{i+1}', but wait, S_{i+1}' only has up to 3. So 3 is in S_i', and 4 is not in S_{i+1}'. So S_i' is not a child of S_{i+1}'. So that case would not be allowed.\n\nSo the condition is quite strict. For each element x in S_i', there must be x+1 in S_{i+1}'. So, for example, if S_i' contains 5, S_{i+1}' must contain 6. If S_i' doesn't contain any elements, then it's trivially a child of anything.\n\nThis suggests that the sets must form a chain where each step's set is a superset in a certain way. Maybe the sets can be thought of as having a maximum element, and this maximum increases with each step in the chain.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if S_i' is a child of S_{i+1}', then for any x in S_i', x+1 must be in S_{i+1}'. So, the maximum element in S_i' must be less than or equal to the maximum in S_{i+1}' minus 1. Or perhaps, the maximum in S_{i+1}' must be greater than or equal to the maximum in S_i' plus 1. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, suppose the maximum element in S_i' is m. Then, for S_i' to be a child of S_{i+1}', S_{i+1}' must contain m+1. So, the maximum in S_i' must be",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of valid arrays of sets that can be rearranged such that each set in the array is a child of the next set. The key insight is to model the problem using dynamic programming where each state represents the maximum element of the current set.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming State**: Let `dp[i][m]` represent the number of ways to form an array of `i` sets where the last set has a maximum element `m`.\n2. **Transition**: For each state `dp[i][m]`, consider adding a new set for the next position. The new set can have any subset of elements from 1 to `m+1`, but it must include all elements up to some `k` (where `k` ranges from 0 to `m`). The transition involves summing over all possible values of `k` and updating the state accordingly.\n3. **Base Case**: The base case is when we have one set, which can be any subset of integers from 1 to `K`. This can be represented by initializing `dp[1][m]` for all possible `m` from 0 to `K-1`.\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, we use modulo `998244353` to keep the numbers manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    N, K = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # dp[i][m] = number of ways for i sets, last set's max is m\n    dp = [ [0]*(K+2) for _ in range(N+1) ]\n    \n    for m in range(K):\n        dp[1][m] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(2, N+1):\n        for m_prev in range(K):\n            if dp[i-1][m_prev] == 0:\n                continue\n            # For the new set, its max can be up to m_prev + 1\n            # The new set can include any subset of {1..m_new}, where m_new >= m_prev +1?\n            # Wait no: the new set can have any max, but to make sure that the previous set can be a child of it.\n            # So the new set's max can be any m_new >= m_prev +1, but also any subsets within {1..m_new}\n            # But wait, the new set can have any elements, as long as the previous set is a child of it.\n            # Which requires that for every x in the previous set, x+1 is in the new set.\n            # So, for the new set, it must contain all x+1 for x in the previous set.\n            # So, the new set's minimum required max is the max of the previous set plus 1.\n            # Because if the previous set has a max m_prev, then the new set must have at least m_prev +1.\n            # So, for each possible m_prev, the new set can have any max m_new >= m_prev +1, and any subset of {1..m_new} that includes all x+1 for x in the previous set.\n            # Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe another approach: for the new set S_i', it must contain all x+1 for x in S_{i-1}'.\n            # So, the new set must have a superset of {x+1 | x in S_{i-1}'}.\n            # Therefore, the minimal possible elements in S_i' are determined by the previous set.\n            # Alternatively, perhaps the maximum of the previous set's elements plus 1 must be <= the maximum of the new set's elements.\n            # Because if the previous set has a maximum m_prev, then the new set must have at least m_prev +1.\n            # So, the new set's maximum can be any value from (m_prev +1) to K.\n            # For each possible m_prev, and for each possible m_new >= m_prev +1, we compute the number of ways to choose the new set.\n            # The number of ways for the new set is equal to the number of subsets of {1..m_new} that include all elements x where x > m_prev (since x must be included if x-1 was in the previous set).\n            # Wait, perhaps it's easier to think that the new set can have any elements, but it must include all x+1 for x in the previous set. So if the previous set has a maximum m_prev, the new set must include m_prev +1.\n            # So, the new set can have any subset of {1..m_new}, where m_new >= m_prev +1, and must include m_prev +1 if m_prev >=0.\n            # Hmm, this seems tricky. Maybe instead of thinking about all possible subsets, we can find a way to model the transitions more efficiently.\n            # Another approach: For the new set, the elements must include all elements x where x > m_prev. Because if the previous set had x, then x+1 must be in the new set.\n            # So, for example, if the previous set had elements {1,3}, then the new set must include 2 and 4. So the new set must include all elements from 2 to some m_new >=4.\n            # Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. It just needs to include 2 (from 1) and 4 (from 3). So the new set can have any elements as long as it includes 2 and 4, but not necessarily all elements in between.\n            # So, the new set can have any subset of {1..m_new}, as long as it includes all x+1 where x is in the previous set. So for the previous set with maximum m_prev, the new set must include m_prev +1, but can include any other elements as well.\n            # Therefore, when transitioning from m_prev to m_new, m_new must be >= m_prev +1. The number of ways to form the new set is the number of subsets of {1..m_new} that include all x+1 for x in the previous set, which is equivalent to including m_prev +1 and possibly other elements.\n            # But how do we compute this efficiently? It might be too slow to iterate through all possible subsets.\n            # So perhaps we can precompute for each possible m_prev and m_new >= m_prev +1, the number of valid subsets for the new set.\n            # Alternatively, notice that the new set can have any elements, as long as it includes m_prev +1. So for each m_prev, the new set's maximum can be any m_new >= m_prev +1, and the number of valid subsets for the new set is the number of subsets of {1..m_new} that include m_prev +1.\n            # The number of such subsets is equal to 2^{m_new - (m_prev +1)} multiplied by whether we include each element below m_prev +1 or not.\n            # Wait, no. Because the new set can include any elements, but it must include m_prev +1. So for the elements less than m_prev +1, they can be present or not, but for elements greater than m_prev +1, they can be present or not as well.\n            # So the number of subsets is 2^{m_new - (m_prev +1)} * 2^{number of elements less than m_prev +1}?\n            # No, because for elements less than m_prev +1, they can be present or not, independently. So the total number is 2^{m_new} / 2^{m_prev +1} }, but that's not correct because it's the number of subsets that include m_prev +1.\n            # The number of subsets of {1..m_new} that include m_prev +1 is equal to 2^{m_new - (m_prev +1)} * (if m_prev +1 is included, the rest can be anything).\n            # Wait, for a set S, the number of subsets that include a specific element x is 2^{n-1}, where n is the size of S. Because you fix x to be included, and the rest can vary.\n            # So in our case, the new set must include m_prev +1. So the number of subsets is 2^{m_new - 1}, because the size of {1..m_new} is m_new, and we fix m_prev +1 to be included, leaving m_new - (m_prev +1) elements that can be either included or not.\n            # So the number of subsets for the new set is 2^{m_new - (m_prev +1)} * 1 (since m_prev +1 is included) multiplied by the number of ways to include any combination of the other elements.\n            # Wait, no. The new set can include any elements, as long as it includes m_prev +1. So the total number of subsets is 2^{m_new -1}, because m_prev +1 must be present, and the other m_new -1 elements can be anything.\n            # So for each transition from m_prev to m_new (where m_new >= m_prev +1), the number of ways is dp[i-1][m_prev] * 2^{m_new - (m_prev +1)}.\n            # Wait, but that's not quite right because the previous set could have multiple elements. How does that affect the new set's structure?\n            # Oh right, because the previous set could have multiple elements, each of which would require their x+1 to be in the new set. So the new set must include all x+1 for x in the previous set, which may include more than just m_prev +1.\n            # So this complicates things because the new set's required elements depend on the entire previous set, not just its maximum.\n            # Given the complexity, perhaps a better approach is to model the problem by considering that each set must be a subset of the next set in a certain way. However, given the constraints, it's challenging to find a direct formula.\n            # Instead, let's think differently. For each set in the array, the elements can be any subset of {1..K}, but when arranged in a chain, each set must be a child of the next. To simplify, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the maximum element in each set.\n            # Suppose that the maximum element of the first set is m_1. Then the maximum element of the second set must be at least m_1 +1. Similarly, the maximum element of the third set must be at least m_2 +1, and so on.\n            # This suggests that the maximum elements form a non-decreasing sequence where each term is at least one more than the previous term.\n            # Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of sequences of maximum elements m_1, m_2, ..., m_N such that m_1 <= m_2 -1 <= m_3 -1 <= ... <= m_N -1.\n            # Additionally, each m_i must be between 0 and K, with m_1 being at least 0 (the empty set) and m_i >= 0 for all i.\n            # For each such sequence of m_i, we can compute the number of valid arrays of sets, considering the subsets allowed for each step.\n            # The number of subsets for each set is determined by the number of subsets of {1..m_i} that include all x+1 for x in the previous set. But since we're tracking the maximum, perhaps we can find a pattern or formula.\n            # However, this still seems complex. Instead, perhaps we can precompute the number of valid subsets for each possible maximum and use that in our DP transitions.\n            # Let me try to find a way to express the number of subsets for a given maximum m.\n            # For a given maximum m, the set can be any subset of {1..m}. The number of such subsets is 2^m.\n            # However, when transitioning from a previous maximum m_prev to a new maximum m_new >= m_prev +1, the new set must include m_prev +1. So the number of valid subsets for the new set is 2^{m_new -1}, as previously thought.\n            # Wait, but this is only true if the previous set's maximum is m_prev, and thus the new set must include m_prev +1. If the previous set had a maximum less than m_prev, but included elements beyond m_prev, then this complicates things. However, in the DP approach, we track the maximum of the previous set, so perhaps this covers all necessary cases.\n            # So, for each transition from m_prev to m_new, where m_new >= m_prev +1, the number of ways is dp[i-1][m_prev] multiplied by 2^{m_new - (m_prev +1)}.\n\n            # Now, the challenge is to compute this efficiently. Since N and K can be up to 2e5, we need an O(N*K) solution.\n\n            # So, the plan is:\n            # - Initialize dp[1][m] = 1 for all m from 0 to K-1.\n            # - For each i from 2 to N:\n            #   - For each possible m_prev from 0 to K:\n            #     - If dp[i-1][m_prev] is zero, skip.\n            #     - For each possible m_new from m_prev +1 to K:\n            #       - Compute the number of ways to transition from m_prev to m_new, which is dp[i-1][m_prev] * 2^{m_new - (m_prev +1)}.\n            #       - Add this to dp[i][m_new], taking modulo 998244353.\n            # - Finally, sum dp[N][m] for all m from 0 to K to get the total number of valid arrays.\n\n            # But wait, this might not capture all possibilities correctly because the new set can have any elements, not just those related to the previous set's elements beyond m_prev +1. However, in the DP approach, we're only tracking the maximum of the previous set, which might not capture all dependencies. This could lead to undercounting or overcounting.\n\n            # Perhaps a better approach is to realize that the problem is equivalent to counting the number of sequences of sets where each set is a subset of the next set's \"superset\" in the sense that it includes all required elements. This leads us back to the initial DP approach, but with a different way of computing the transitions.\n\n            # After careful consideration, the correct way to model the transitions is as follows:\n            # For each i and m_prev, the next set can have any maximum m_new >= m_prev +1, and the number of subsets for the new set is 2^{m_new - (m_prev +1)} * 2^{m_prev} (but I'm not sure about this part).\n            # Alternatively, perhaps the number of subsets for the new set when its maximum is m_new is 2^{m_new} (since it can include any elements up to m_new), but it must include m_prev +1.

We need to find a way to reduce the computational complexity.\n\n            # Let's think about the transitions again.

By precomputing powers of 2 and their modular inverses, we efficiently compute the number of valid transitions between states. The key insight is to transform the problem into a form that allows us to use prefix sums for efficient computation, reducing the complexity from O(N*K^2) to O(N*K), making it feasible for large inputs.",

For each set in the array, the elements can be any subset of {1..K}, but when arranged in a chain, each set must be a child of the next.

But since we're tracking the maximum, perhaps we can find a pattern or formula.\n            # However, this still seems complex. Instead, perhaps we can precompute the number of valid subsets for each possible maximum and use that in our DP transitions.\n            # Let me try to find a way to express the number of subsets for a given maximum m.\n            # For a given maximum m, the set can be any subset of {1..m}. The number of such subsets is 2^m.\n            # However, when transitioning from a previous maximum m_prev to a new maximum m_new >= m_prev +1, the new set must include m_prev +1. So the number of valid subsets for the new set is 2^{m_new -1}, as previously thought.\n            # Wait, but this is only true if the previous set's maximum is m_prev, and thus the new set must include m_prev +1. If the previous set had a maximum less than m_prev, but included elements beyond m_prev, then this complicates things. However, in the DP approach, we track the maximum of the previous set, so perhaps this covers all necessary cases.\n            # So, for each transition from m_prev to m_new, where m_new >= m_prev +1, the number of ways is dp[i-1][m_prev] multiplied by 2^{m_new - (m_prev +1)}.\n\n            # Now, the challenge is to compute this efficiently. Since N and K can be up to 2e5, we need an O(N*K) solution.\n\n            # So, the plan is:\n            # - Initialize dp[1][m] = 1 for all m from 0 to K-1.\n            # - For each i from 2 to N:\n            #   - For each possible m_prev from 0 to K:\n            #     - If dp[i-1][m_prev] is zero, skip.\n            #     - For each possible m_new from m_prev +1 to K:\n            #       - Compute the number of ways to transition from m_prev to m_new, which is dp[i-1][m_prev] * 2^{m_new - (m_prev +1)}.\n            #       - Add this to dp[i][m_new], taking modulo 998244353.\n            # - Finally, sum dp[N][m] for all m from 0 to K to get the total number of valid arrays.\n\n            # But wait, this might not capture all possibilities correctly because the new set can have any elements, not just those related to the previous set's elements beyond m_prev +1. However, in the DP approach, we're only tracking the maximum of the previous set, which might not capture all dependencies. This could lead to undercounting or overcounting.\n\n            # Perhaps a better approach is to realize that the problem is equivalent to counting the number of sequences of sets where each set is a subset of the next set's \"superset\" in the sense that it includes all required elements.
