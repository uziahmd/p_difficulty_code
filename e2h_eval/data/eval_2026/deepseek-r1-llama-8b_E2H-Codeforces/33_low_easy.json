You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to maximize the value of a given integer 'a' by replacing some of its digits with digits from a sequence 's'. Each digit in 's' can be used at most once for replacement. Hmm.\n\nLet me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. So, I'm given two strings: a and s. The string a represents the number, and s is a sequence of digits. For each digit in s, I can choose any position in a to replace one of its digits with that digit, but each digit from s can only be used once. My goal is to perform these replacements such that the resulting number is as large as possible.\n\nWait, right. So the approach should be to find the best possible way to replace digits in 'a' with the digits from 's' to get the maximum number.\n\nFirst, I think about how to approach this. Since I want the maximum number, I should try to replace the leftmost possible digits with the largest possible available digits from 's'.\n\nLet me think step by step:\n\n1. Sort the sequence 's' in descending order. This way, when I iterate through each digit in 'a', I can pick the largest possible available digit from 's' for each position.\n\n2. For each position in 'a' (starting from the left), I check if the current digit is less than the largest available digit in 's'. If yes, then I replace it with that digit and remove it from 's'. If not, I leave it as is and proceed to the next position.\n\n3. Continue this until either all digits in 's' are used or all positions in 'a' are considered.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. What if using a smaller digit in an earlier position allows for more larger digits to be placed later? But no, because replacing the earliest possible digit with the largest possible available digit gives the maximum overall gain. Because a higher digit in the leftmost position contributes more to the number's value than any subsequent digits.\n\nSo the strategy seems solid.\n\nNow, let's think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, I need to process both 'a' and 's' as lists of characters so that I can manipulate individual digits.\n\nThen, sort the 's' list in descending order. So for example, if 's' is ['0','1','0'], after sorting it becomes ['1','0','0'].\n\nNext, for each digit in 'a', starting from the first, compare it with the largest remaining digit in 's'. If the current digit is smaller, replace it with the largest digit from 's' and remove that digit from 's'. Continue until 's' is empty or all digits in 'a' are processed.\n\nBut wait, what if 's' has more digits than needed? For example, 's' has 10 digits and 'a' has 5 digits. Then, we'll use the top 5 digits from 's' sorted in descending order.\n\nAnother thing to consider: leading zeros. The output shouldn't have leading zeros. So, the original 'a' doesn't have any, but after replacement, say the first digit is replaced with '0', which would be invalid. So, we need to ensure that the first character is not zero unless the entire number is zero, which isn't allowed here since 'a' is given without leading zeros.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, 'a' does not contain leading zeros. So, after replacements, the first digit can't be zero. So during the replacement process, if the first digit is being considered for replacement, we must not choose a digit from 's' that is zero, unless all other options are worse.\n\nWait, no. Let's think: for the first position, if the current digit is '9', then even if 's' has '9's, we don't replace it. But if the current digit is '1', and the sorted 's' starts with '9', then replacing it with '9' is better. But what if the first digit is '1' and the 's' starts with '0'? Then replacing it would result in a number starting with '0', which is invalid. So in that case, we cannot perform the replacement for the first digit.\n\nSo, in the algorithm, for each position i in 'a':\n\n- if i is 0 (the first digit), then the replacement digit must be greater than or equal to the current digit. Otherwise, it's invalid.\n\nWait, no. Because if the current digit is less than the replacement digit, but the replacement digit is lower than the current digit, that's not useful. So, for the first digit, we can only replace it if the new digit is strictly larger than the current digit. Because otherwise, it would make the number smaller or equal, which is not desired.\n\nWait, no. Because if the current digit is",

Each digit in 's' can be used at most once for replacement. The goal is to perform these replacements such that the resulting number is as large as possible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Sequence**: First, we sort the sequence 's' in descending order. This allows us to use the largest available digits from 's' first, which helps in maximizing the value of 'a'.\n2. **Iterate Through Digits**: For each digit in 'a' (starting from the left), we compare it with the largest remaining digit from the sorted 's'. If the current digit in 'a' is smaller than the largest available digit from 's', we replace it and remove the digit from 's'. This process continues until either all digits in 's' are used or all positions in 'a' are considered.\n3. **Avoid Leading Zeros**: Ensure that the first digit of 'a' after any replacements does not become zero, as leading zeros are not allowed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na = input().strip()\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Convert a and s into lists for easy manipulation\na_digits = list(a)\ns_digits = list(s)\n\n# Sort s in descending order\ns_sorted = sorted(s_digits, reverse=True)\n\n# We'll iterate through each digit of a\nfor i in range(len(a_digits)):\n    if not s_sorted:\n        break  # No more digits to replace\n    current = a_digits[i]\n    max_s = s_sorted[0]\n    if current < max_s:\n        a_digits[i] = max_s\n        s_sorted.pop(0)\n    else:\n        continue  # No gain in replacing, move to next digit\n\n# Now, construct the result string\nresult = ''.join(a_digits)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting the Sequence**: By sorting 's' in descending order, we ensure that we always have the largest available digit to consider for replacement, which is crucial for maximizing the value of 'a'.\n- **Replacement Strategy**: We iterate through each digit of 'a' starting from the leftmost digit. For each digit, if the largest remaining digit from 's' is larger than the current digit, we replace it. This ensures that the most significant digits of 'a' are maximized first.\n- **Efficiency**: The algorithm efficiently processes each digit of 'a' exactly once, making it linear in complexity relative to the length of 'a', which is optimal for the problem constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that we get the maximum possible value for 'a' using the given sequence 's' while adhering to the constraints and avoiding invalid leading zeros.",
