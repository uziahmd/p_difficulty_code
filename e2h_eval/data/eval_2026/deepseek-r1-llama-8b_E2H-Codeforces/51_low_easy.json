Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to check if the pile of letters can exactly form the two names given. Hmm, right.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again. Oh right, the input consists of three lines: guest's name, host's name, and the pile. We need to check if the pile is a rearrangement of all the letters from both names combined, without any extra letters.\n\nSo, the approach here is straightforward. I think I should count the frequency of each letter in the guest and host names, combine them, then compare it with the frequencies in the pile.\n\nWait, how do I do that? Well, in Python, I can use the Counter class from the collections module. That makes sense because it allows me to count the occurrences of each character easily.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three input lines.\n2. Combine the guest and host names into one string.\n3. Create a Counter for this combined string.\n4. Create a Counter for the pile string.\n5. Compare the two Counters. If they are equal, output YES; else, NO.\n\nBut wait, what about case sensitivity? The problem says all letters are uppercase, so we don't have to worry about that.\n\nAlso, what about the lengths? Well, if the combined length isn't equal to the pile's length, we can immediately return NO without further checks.\n\nOh right, that's an important optimization. So first, calculate the sum of the lengths of guest and host. If this sum is not equal to the length of the pile, output NO.\n\nOtherwise, proceed with counting the letters.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\n- Read guest = input().strip()\n- Read host = input().strip()\n- Read pile = input().strip()\n\nThen, combined = guest + host\nIf len(combined) != len(pile): print 'NO' and exit.\n\nElse, create counters:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ncounter_combined = Counter(combined)\ncounter_pile = Counter(pile)\n\nif counter_combined == counter_pile:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nTesting with the example given:\n\nSample Input 1:\n['SANTACLAUS', 'DEDMOROZ', 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\nCombined length: len(SANTACLAUS) is 10, DEDMOROZ is 8. 10+8=18. Pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS which is 17? Wait wait, wait no. Let me count.\n\nWait, SANTACLAUS is 10 letters, DEDMOROZ is 8, so combined 18. The pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" â€” let's see: S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S. Wait, maybe that's 18 letters as well. Because the sample output is YES.\n\nIn the second sample, the guest and host combined might have different letters than the pile. For example, the note says there's a missing 'P' and extra 'L'.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where the pile is empty but guest and host are also empty? But according to the problem statement, all lines are non-empty. So no, the input will have at least one character in each line.\n\nAnother edge case: when guest is empty, but that's impossible as per input constraints.\n\nWait, no, the problem says each line is not empty. So guest, host, and pile each have at least one character.\n\nAnother case: when the pile has exactly the same letters as guest + host, but in a different order. But since the Counter compares the counts, order doesn't matter.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nI think that's solid. Now, implementing this in Python.\n\nWait, but in Python, the input lines may have leading or trailing spaces? No, the problem says each line is not empty and contains only uppercase letters. So strip() is not needed, but perhaps using .strip() is safe, just in case.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nRead guest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    from collections import Counter\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but importing inside the else clause is not allowed. So better to import at the top.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n   ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the pile of letters found at the door can be rearranged to form both the guest's name and the host's name exactly. This means that the pile must contain exactly the same number of each letter as the combined names of the guest and host.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the guest's name, host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names:** Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Check Lengths:** If the combined length of the guest's and host's names does not match the length of the pile, immediately output \"NO\".\n4. **Count Letters:** Use a counter to count the frequency of each letter in both the combined names and the pile.\n5. **Compare Counts:** If the counts of letters in the combined names match those in the pile, output \"YES\". Otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the exact match of letters using their frequencies, which is both time-efficient and straightforward.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The input consists of three lines, each representing the guest's name, host's name, and the pile of letters respectively.\n- **Combining Names:** By concatenating the guest's and host's names, we create a single string that represents all the letters that should be present in the pile.\n- **Length Check:** If the total number of letters in the combined names does not match the pile's length, it's impossible for the pile to be a rearrangement of the names, so we output \"NO\".\n- **Counting Letters:** Using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, we count the occurrences of each letter in both the combined names and the pile.\n- **Comparison:** By comparing the two counters, we determine if they are identical, which would mean the pile can be rearranged to form the guest's and host's names exactly.\n\nThis method ensures that we efficiently and accurately solve the problem with minimal computational overhead.",
