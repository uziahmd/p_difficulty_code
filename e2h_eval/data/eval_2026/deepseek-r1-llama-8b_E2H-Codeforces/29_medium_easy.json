Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Andrew and Eugene are playing a game with string substitutions. The goal is to process a series of substitution queries on a string and then compute the number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again carefully to understand all the details.\n\nThe problem says that each query is of the form \"di->ti\". For each such query, every occurrence of digit di in the string s is replaced by ti. The order of the queries matters because each one is applied in sequence.\n\nFor example, if the string is '123123' and the first query is \"2→00\", it becomes \"10031003\". Then another query \"3→\" replaces all 3s with empty strings, resulting in \"1212\".\n\nAfter processing all queries, we need to compute the numeric value of the resulting string, ignoring leading zeros unless it's the only digit (like zero), and then find its remainder when divided by 1e9+7.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, let's think about how to represent the transformations efficiently. Since the string can be modified multiple times with overlapping substitutions, it's not straightforward to apply each substitution step by step as strings, especially for large n and s. Processing each substitution naively could be inefficient, but given the constraints (s up to 105 characters, n up to 105), even a straightforward approach might work.\n\nWait, but each substitution can potentially change multiple digits at once. So for each query, I need to replace all instances of di in the current s with ti.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read the initial string s.\n2. For each query, replace all occurrences of di in s with ti.\n3. After all queries, convert the resulting string into a number, modulo 1e9+7, handling leading zeros appropriately.\n\nBut wait, applying each substitution step by step might be computationally manageable since the maximum length is 105, and each substitution can't increase the length beyond that. So even after all substitutions, the length would still be manageable.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n- Read s from input.\n- Read n, then read each query.\n- For each query, process it by replacing all di in the current s with ti.\n- After processing all queries, compute the numeric value mod 1e9+7.\n\nNow, the key is to process the substitutions correctly. Let's think about how to implement this.\n\nEach substitution is a replacement of a single character (di) with a string (ti). So for each query, the current s is modified: every time di appears, it's replaced by ti.\n\nHow to implement this in Python?\n\nWe can use the string replace method. For example, for a query '2->00', we can do s = s.replace('2', '00').\n\nYes, because the replace function will replace every occurrence of the character with the substring.\n\nSo, the steps in code would be:\n\nRead s from the first line.\n\nn = int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    parts = input().split('->')\n    di = parts[0]\n    ti = parts[1]\n\n    s = s.replace(di, ti)\n\nThen, process s as per the rules.\n\nBut wait, what if di is more than one character? No, according to the problem statement, di is exactly one digit, so each query has di as a single character.\n\nSo, the code should split the query correctly.\n\nOnce all substitutions are done, we need to compute the numeric value of s, modulo 1e9+7.\n\nBut there's a catch: leading zeros are ignored. For example, if the string is '00012', the numeric value is 12, not 00012.\n\nHowever, if the entire string is zeros, like '0000', the result should be 0.\n\nSo, the approach is to take s, remove leading zeros, and if the resulting string is empty (meaning all were zeros), output 0. Otherwise, output the number formed by the remaining digits.\n\nBut since the string can be very long (up to 105 characters), directly converting it to an integer might cause issues with very large numbers. Therefore, we need a way to compute the modulo without dealing with the full number.\n\nWait, right. Because 105 digits is a very big number, which can't be stored as a regular integer in Python without any problem, but even so, processing it as a string is necessary.\n\nWait, no—Python can handle arbitrarily large integers. So, perhaps, it's manageable to compute the number as an integer and then take modulo 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, the string could be 105 characters long, which when converted to an integer is 10^104, which is a huge number. But Python can handle that, but computing it may be time-consuming. However, given the problem constraints, it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the modulo as we build the number from the string, which is more efficient.\n\nSo, here's the plan for the modulo part:\n\nInitialize a variable, say 'result_mod', to 0.\n\nFor each character in the final s:\n\n   result_mod = (result_mod * 10 + int(char)) % MOD\n\nWhere MOD is 1e9+7.\n\nThis way, we avoid dealing with large numbers and just keep the modulo at each step.\n\nBut also, we have to handle leading zeros. So, we need to skip leading zeros until the first non-zero digit. If all are zeros, return 0.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that leading zeros should be ignored when representing the number. So, for example, '00012' becomes 12, '0000' becomes 0.\n\nSo, the steps for processing the modulo:\n\n1. Iterate through each character in the final s.\n\n2. Skip leading zeros until the first non-zero character is found.\n\n3. Once a non-zero character is found, start processing each digit, updating the modulo result.\n\n4. If all characters are zero, output 0.\n\nBut wait, if the string is empty after substitutions (though the problem states that initially s has at least one character, but after substitutions, maybe not?), then the result is zero.\n\nWait, the initial s is non-empty (length ≥1), but after substitutions, it could become empty? For example, if a substitution replaces all digits with nothing. Like, s is '3', and a query '3→'. Then the result is an empty string. According to the note, in such case, it's considered as zero.\n\nSo, during the processing, after all substitutions, the resulting s could be empty or have leading zeros.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nProcess the final s:\n\n- If s is empty, output 0.\n\n- Else, strip leading zeros: iterate until the first non-zero character.\n\n   - If all are zeros, output 0.\n\n   - Else, from the first non-zero character onwards, process each digit to compute the modulo.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nIn code:\n\nfinal_s = ... (after substitutions)\n\nif not final_s:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Remove leading zeros\n    first_non_zero = 0\n    while first_non_zero < len(final_s) and final_s[first_non_zero] == '0':\n        first_non_zero +=1\n    if first_non_zero == len(final_s):\n        # All zeros\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        mod = 10**9+7\n        res = 0\n        for c in final_s[first_non_zero:]:\n            res = (res *10 + int(c)) % mod\n        print(res)\n\nYes, that should handle all cases.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, test the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, the input is in the form of lines, but the user provided it as a list, but in reality, the input is:\n\nLine 1: '123123'\n\nLine 2: 1\n\nLine 3: '2->00'\n\nLine 4: '3->'\n\nWait, no, the sample input is presented as:\n\nThe input is:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWhich suggests that the first line is '123123', then 1, then '2->00', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual input is:\n\nThe first line is the string s: '123123'.\n\nSecond line: n=1.\n\nThird line: the query '2->00'.\n\nWait, no, the sample input shows four elements, perhaps indicating that the code needs to read four lines.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is written as:\n\n123123\n\n1\n\n2->00\n\n123123\n\n1\n\n3->\n\n222\n\n2\n\n2->0\n\n0->7\n\n1000000008\n\n0\n\nWait, no, the sample input is written as a list, but perhaps each element represents a line. So, for instance, the first line is '123123', then '1', then '2->00', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial input is:\n\nThe first line is '123123' (s).\n\nThe second line is 1 (n).\n\nThe third line is '2->00' (first query).\n\nThe fourth line is '3->' (second query).\n\nWait, but the sample input provided in the problem is:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nSo, the code should read these four lines as follows.\n\nWait, perhaps the code reads the first line as s, the next line as n, then for each of the next n lines, read the query.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should read the first line as s, then read the next line as n, and then read n lines as the queries.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user provides a list where each element is a line, including the s, n, and queries.\n\nSo, perhaps the code is supposed to read the first line as s, then the second line as n, and then read n lines as the queries.\n\nSo, for the sample input:\n\nThe first line is '123123' → s = '123123'\n\nn is 1 → n=1.\n\nThen, read the next line as the first query: '2->00'.\n\nBut wait, the sample input shows four elements in the list. That can't be, because n is 1, so there should be only two more lines after n.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is presented incorrectly, but perhaps the actual input is four lines.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the code structure.\n\nIn the code, the first line is s, which is a string.\n\nThen, the second line is n, an integer.\n\nThen, for n times, read a line which is the query.\n\nSo, the code will be:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    query = input().strip()\n\n    process the query.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the sample input is:\n\nThe first line is '123123'.\n\nSecond line is 1.\n\nThird line is '2->00'.\n\nFourth line is '3->'.\n\nWait, but in the sample provided, the output is:\n\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input is given as four lines, which seems to imply that n is 3, but perhaps the initial sample was misrepresented.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nn = 1\n\nquery: '2->00'\n\nThen another query '3->'.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample has three queries, but the way it's written is unclear.\n\nWell, perhaps the code is correct, and the sample input is handled correctly regardless.\n\nSo, back to the code.\n\nImplementing the substitution:\n\nEach query is processed in order.\n\nNow, for each query, we split it into di and ti.\n\nBut the query is given as a string, e.g., '2->00'.\n\nSo, in code, for each query:\n\nparts = query.split('->')\n\ndi = parts[0]\n\nti = parts[1]\n\nThen, s = s.replace(di, ti)\n\nSo, this should correctly substitute all occurrences.\n\nWait, but what if di is longer than one character? According to the problem statement, di is exactly one digit, so parts[0] will be a single character.\n\nThus, the code is safe.\n\nNow, the substitution is straightforward.\n\nOnce all substitutions are done, process the resulting s as per the modulo.\n\nNow, testing the sample:\n\nSample Input:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nn = 1\n\nQueries:\n\n2->00\n\nProcessing s:\n\nReplace '2' with '00' → '130013'\n\nBut wait, the first query is '2->00', so s becomes '130013'.\n\nBut then, the second query is '3->', which replaces '3' with empty string.\n\nSo, s becomes '10013'.\n\nWait, no, initial s is '123123'.\n\nAfter replacing 2 with 00:\n\nDigits '2's are replaced by '00'. So, '123123' → replace the '2's in positions 2 and 5: '1', '2' → '00', '6' → '6', '2' → '00', '3' → '3'.\n\nWait, wait, no: the original string is '1','2','3','1','2','3'.\n\nAfter replacing 2 with 00, it becomes '1','00','3','1','00','3' → '10031003'.\n\nAh, right, I see. So after first query, s becomes '10031003'.\n\nThen, the second query is '3->', which replaces '3' with empty string.\n\nSo, in '10031003', each '3' is replaced by empty. So:\n\nLooking at each character:\n\n1 → 1\n\n0 →0\n\n0 →0\n\n3 → ''\n\n1 →1\n\n0 →0\n\n0 →0\n\n3 → ''\n\nSo, the new s is '1001000'.\n\nWait, but the sample says that after the second query, s is '1212'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sample.\n\nWait, the sample input is written as:\n\nThe first query is '2->00' → transforms s to '10031003'.\n\nThe second query is '3->' → transforms s to '1212'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample.\n\nWait, the initial s is '123123'.\n\nAfter first query: '2's are replaced by '00' → '1' followed by '00', then '3', then '1', then '00', then '3' → '10031003'.\n\nThen, the second query is '3->', which replaces all '3's with empty.\n\nSo, in '10031003', the '3's are at positions 2, 4, and 6.\n\nReplacing each '3' with '' gives:\n\nPosition 0: '1'\n\nPosition 1: '0'\n\nPosition 2: '' → so, the next character is position 3: '1'\n\nPosition 4: '' → next is position 5: '0'\n\nPosition 6: '' → next is position 7: '3'? Wait, wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, the string is '1','0','0','3','1','0','0','3'.\n\nAfter replacing '3's with '', the string becomes '1','0','0', '', '1','0','0', '' → concatenated, it becomes '10010100'.\n\nWait, that's 7 characters.\n\nWait, but the sample says after the second query, s becomes '1212'.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait, no, perhaps the second query is '3->', which replaces '3' with empty string.\n\nSo, the initial s after first query is '10031003'.\n\nNow, replacing '3's:\n\nLooking for '3's: the string is '1','0','0','3','1','0','0','3'.\n\nSo, the '3's are at index 3 and 7 (assuming 0-based).\n\nReplacing them with empty, the string becomes:\n\n'1','0','0', '' , '1','0','0', '' → concatenated as '10010100' → which is '10010100'.\n\nBut sample says after second query, s is '1212'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the substitution process. Or perhaps the sample is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is wrong, but more likely, I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, looking back at the sample:\n\nIn the first example, the output after first query is '10031003', then after second query, '1212'.\n\nWait, perhaps the second query is '3->' and the string after first query is '10031003'.\n\nSo, let's process each '3':\n\nLooking at each character:\n\nThe string is '1','0','0','3','1','0','0','3'.\n\nReplaced with empty, it becomes '10010100'.\n\nWhich is 7 characters, but sample shows '1212' which is 4.\n\nHmm, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the substitution.\n\nWait, maybe the second query is applied before the first. But no, the queries are applied in the order they are given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample is wrong, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is different. Looking back, the sample input is:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, perhaps each element is a line. So, perhaps the initial s is '123123', then n is 1, then the query is '2->00', then another line '123123\\n1\\n3->', which is another query? Or perhaps each line is a separate input.\n\nNo, that can't be. Because n is 1, so only one query.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nThe first line is s='123123'.\n\nThe second line is n=1.\n\nThe third line is the query '2->00'.\n\nThe fourth line is another query '3->'.\n\nWait, that would make n=2, but the sample output has four results, which implies four queries.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the sample, but perhaps the code is correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the code will process the substitutions correctly.\n\nAnother point to consider: in the substitution, the order of the queries is crucial. Each substitution replaces the current state of the string.\n\nSo, the code must process each query in the order given.\n\nAnother edge case: substitution where di is replaced by an empty string, which removes all occurrences of di.\n\nAnother edge case: substitution where di is replaced by a longer string, increasing the length.\n\nBut as per the problem statement, the code must handle all these cases.\n\nTesting another sample:\n\nSample Input 3:\n\ns is '222'\n\nn=2.\n\nQueries:\n\n2→0\n\n0→7.\n\nSo, first query replaces '2's with '0's → s becomes '000'.\n\nSecond query replaces '0's with '7's → s becomes '777'.\n\nSo, the output is 777 mod 1e9+7 → 777.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code should correctly handle that.\n\nAnother test case: when s is '1000000008' and n=0, then the output is 1000000008 mod 1e9+7.\n\nCompute 1000000008 mod 1e9+7.\n\nSince 1e9+7 is 1000000007, 1000000008 mod 1e9+7 is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle that.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nRead s, n, and process each query.\n\nThen, compute the modulo as described.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nMOD = 10**9 +7\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\nfor _ in range(n):\n    query = input().strip()\n    di, ti = query.split('->')\n    s = s.replace(di, ti)\n\n# Now compute the result\nif not s:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    first_non_zero = 0\n    while first_non_zero < len(s) and s[first_non_zero] == '0':\n        first_non_zero +=1\n    if first_non_zero == len(s):\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        res = 0\n        for c in s[first_non_zero:]:\n            res = (res *10 + int(c)) % MOD\n        print(res)\n\nWait, but what if the substitution leads to s being empty? For example, s was '3', and a query '3→' makes s empty. In that case, the code outputs 0.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the code against the samples:\n\nSample 1:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nn =1\n\nquery '2->00' → s becomes '10031003'\n\nn=1, so only one query.\n\nThen, compute the mod:\n\ns is '10031003' → first non-zero is at 0.\n\nCompute 1, then 0, 0, 3 (but 3 is replaced to empty in the next query?), no—wait, the second query is '3->', which is another substitution.\n\nWait, in the sample input, perhaps the code is given two queries.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nn=2\n\nqueries:\n\n'2->00'\n\n'3->'\n\nSo, after first substitution, s is '10031003'.\n\nThen, after second substitution, replace '3's with empty: '10031003' → the '3's are at positions 3 and 7.\n\nSo, s becomes '1001000' → which is '1001000'.\n\nSo, the numeric value is 1001000 → 1,001,000.\n\nModulo 1e9+7 is 1,001,000.\n\nBut in the sample, the output is '1212'.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the sample's initial data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is:\n\ns = '123123'\n\nn=1\n\nqueries:\n\n'2->00' → s becomes '10031003'\n\nthen, n=1, so no more queries.\n\nSo, the output is 10031003 → which is 10,031,003.\n\nModulo 1e9+7 is 10,031,003.\n\nBut in the sample, the output is '10031003', which is the same as the computed value.\n\nBut the sample shows the output as '10031003' → which is the same as the string after substitution.\n\nBut the sample output is given as ['10031003', '1212', '777', '1'], which suggests that the code is to output the transformed string after each substitution, but that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample input. The sample input is a list of four lines, which includes s, n, and two queries, but perhaps it's more than that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is a list of four lines, each being a line of input, including s, n, and the queries.\n\nIn that case:\n\nLine 1: '123123' → s = '123123'\n\nLine 2: '1' → n=1\n\nLine 3: '2->00' → first query\n\nLine 4: '3->' → second query\n\nSo, n=2.\n\nSo, processing both queries.\n\nFirst query: replace '2' with '00' → s becomes '10031003'.\n\nSecond query: replace '3' with '' → s becomes '10031003' → replacing '3's:\n\nLooking for '3's in '10031003':\n\npositions 3 and 7.\n\nSo, after replacement, the string becomes '1001000'.\n\nSo, the numeric value is 1001000 → 1,001,000.\n\nModulo 1e9+7 is 1,001,000.\n\nBut the sample output for this case would be 1001000 mod 1e9+7 = 1,001,000.\n\nBut the sample output shows '1212'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the substitution order wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second query is applied before the first, but that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial s is '123123', n=1, query '2->00' → s becomes '10031003'.\n\nThen, the second query is '3->' → s becomes '10031003' → replace '3's → '1001000'.\n\nBut the sample output is '1212' for the second substitution.\n\nHmm, perhaps the sample is wrong, but I'm probably misunderstanding it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial substitution is done differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the substitution is done in the reverse order.\n\nNo, the problem states that the queries are applied in the order they are given.\n\nSo, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is not the first sample but the third.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWhich seems to have four elements, but n is 3.\n\nSo, perhaps the code is reading the first line as s, then n is 3, then read three queries.\n\nSo, s is '123123'\n\nn=3\n\nQueries:\n\n'2->00'\n\n'3->'\n\n'222' → wait, no, the third line is '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7' ?\n\nWait, perhaps each query is a separate line, but the way the sample is written is unclear.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck on the sample, but perhaps the code is correct regardless.\n\nAnother thing to note: the code as written will process the substitutions correctly, regardless of the order.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nTesting the sample where s is '222', n=2, queries '2->0' and '0->7' → after first substitution, s is '000', then '777' → mod is 777.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: s is '1000000008', n=0. So, no substitutions, output is 1000000008 mod 1e9+7 → 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nTherefore, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a series of substitution queries on an initial string of digits and then compute the resulting number modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). The substitutions replace each occurrence of a specific digit with a given substring, and we must handle leading zeros appropriately.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the initial string `s` and the number of queries `n`.\n2. **Process Queries**: For each query, replace all occurrences of the specified digit in the current string with the given substring.\n3. **Compute Result**: After processing all queries, convert the resulting string into a number, ignoring leading zeros unless the result is zero. Compute this number modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    query = input().strip()\n    di, ti = query.split('->')\n    s = s.replace(di, ti)\n\n# Compute the result after all substitutions\nif not s:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    first_non_zero = 0\n    while first_non_zero < len(s) and s[first_non_zero] == '0':\n        first_non_zero += 1\n    if first_non_zero == len(s):\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        res = 0\n        for c in s[first_non_zero:]:\n            res = (res * 10 + int(c)) % MOD\n        print(res)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from standard input.\n2. **Processing Queries**: Each query is processed by replacing all occurrences of the specified digit in the string with the given substring. This is done using Python's string `replace` method.\n3. **Handling Result Calculation**: After all substitutions, the resulting string is processed to remove leading zeros. If the string is empty or consists entirely of zeros, the result is zero. Otherwise, each digit of the resulting string is processed to compute the number modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\), ensuring that we handle large numbers efficiently without overflow.\n\nThis approach ensures that each substitution is handled correctly and efficiently, and the final result is computed accurately within the constraints.",
