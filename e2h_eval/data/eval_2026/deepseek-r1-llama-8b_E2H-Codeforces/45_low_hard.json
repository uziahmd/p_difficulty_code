There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tennis tournament. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe tournament is knockout, meaning every game eliminates one player. The grid arrangement is not fixed yet, but there's a rule: two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. Also, both must have won all their previous games to reach that point.\n\nThe goal is to find the maximum number of games the winner can participate in. So, I need to model how the winner can progress through the tournament, ensuring that each game adheres to the given rule.\n\nLet's think about small examples first.\n\nFor n=2: Only one game, so the answer is 1.\nFor n=3: The winner plays two games. How? Maybe the winner beats two players in consecutive games. Like, in the first round, he plays someone, then in the next round, another. But wait, how do the rounds work here? Since it's a knockout, each win brings you to the next round. So for 3 players, the structure is such that the winner plays two games.\n\nAnother example: n=4. The maximum is 2 games. Because if the winner plays two games, the third game would require that the opponent has either 0 or 1 games played. Wait, but after two wins, the opponent could have played once. Hmm, maybe the structure allows the winner to play two games, but not three.\n\nWait, the sample input for n=10 gives an output of 4. So how does that happen?\n\nLet me try to model this. The maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by building a path where each step's opponent has a game count differing by at most one from the winner's current count.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the longest possible path where each step's opponent satisfies the condition based on the number of games they've played so far.\n\nLet's model the situation as a series of games. The winner starts with 0 games. Each game increases the count by 1.\n\nAt each step, the next opponent must have a number of games that is either equal to, one less, or one more than the current count of the winner.\n\nBut how do the opponents' counts get determined? Because each time the winner plays, the opponent also gains a game count.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal way is for the winner to play as many games as possible, each time choosing an opponent who has the same number of games or differs by one.\n\nSo, let's think recursively. The maximum games for the winner when there are m players left is some function f(m). Or perhaps it's better to model it iteratively.\n\nAlternatively, we can model it as the Fibonacci sequence. Because each step depends on the sum of certain previous steps.\n\nWait, for n=10, the output is 4. Let's see: 10 is the total number of players. To maximize the games, the winner needs to play as many times as possible, each time facing an opponent with a similar game count.\n\nLet me try to see what happens for different n:\n\nn=2: 1 game\nn=3: 2 games\nn=4: 2 games\nn=5: Let's see. The winner could play 3 games. How?\n\nFirst, he plays someone (game 1), then someone else (game 2). Now, to get to game 3, he needs to face someone who has either 1 or 2 games. But wait, after two games, he's the winner of two matches. The third match would be against someone who has won once or twice.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the minimal number of players required to allow k games.\n\nBecause each game the winner plays adds one to his count and requires that the opponent's count is within one of his. So, the minimal number of players needed to support k games is something we can model.\n\nLet me think of it this way: for the winner to play k games, he needs to have k opponents. Each of these opponents must have a number of games that is either equal to, one more, or one less than the current count of the winner before the game.\n\nWait, perhaps for each game i (the i-th game the winner plays), the opponent must have a game count of either i-1, i, or i+1, depending on the state.\n\nBut this seems a bit vague. Maybe another approach: the maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest k such that the sum of the minimum required players for each step is less than or equal to n.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's similar to the Fibonacci sequence because each step depends on the sum of the previous steps.\n\nWait, looking at the sample where n=10, the output is 4. Let's",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given a specific rule about the number of games each player must have played before facing each other.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the number of players required to allow the winner to play `k` games follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. This is because each game the winner plays depends on the sum of the minimum players required for the previous two games. The approach involves iteratively calculating the minimum number of players needed for the winner to play up to `k` games and finding the largest `k` such that this number does not exceed the given `n`.\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the smallest values where the winner can play 1 game (needs 2 players).\n2. **Iterative Calculation**: For each subsequent game count `k`, compute the minimum number of players required using the sum of the previous two game counts.\n3. **Check Feasibility**: Continue this process until the computed number of players exceeds the given `n`.\n4. **Determine Maximum Games**: The largest `k` for which the required players do not exceed `n` is the answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nif n == 1:\n    print(0)\nelif n == 2:\n    print(1)\nelse:\n    max_games = 1\n    players = 2\n    while True:\n        next_players = players + max_games\n        if next_players > n:\n            break\n        players, max_games += 1\n    print(max_games)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start by checking if the number of players `n` is 1 or 2, which are edge cases directly solvable.\n- **Iterative Calculation**: For each possible game count `k`, we calculate the minimum number of players required using the sum of the previous two game counts. This ensures that the winner can continue playing without violating the game count rule.\n- **Feasibility Check**: If the required number of players for `k+1` games exceeds `n`, we stop the iteration.\n- **Result**: The maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by the largest `k` where the required players do not exceed `n`.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limit of `n`.",
