There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tennis tournament. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe tournament is knockout, meaning every game eliminates one player. The grid arrangement is not fixed yet, but there's a rule: two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. Also, both must have won all their previous games to reach that point.\n\nThe goal is to find the maximum possible number of games the winner can play in, given n players.\n\nLet's look at the examples to get some intuition.\n\nIn the first sample with n=2: There's only one game. So output is 1.\n\nFor n=3: The winner plays two games. How? Maybe the structure is like: player 1 vs 2 (winner is 1), then 1 vs 3. So in each round, the number of games increases, but the difference between games played is at most one.\n\nWait, but how does the tournament structure affect the number of games the winner plays? It seems like we need to arrange the matches in such a way that the winner can play as many as possible, considering the constraints on the number of games each opponent has played before facing the winner.\n\nHmm. So the key is to model the path of the winner through the tournament, ensuring that each time they play, their opponent has either the same number of previous games or just one less.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tournament. Since it's a knockout, the number of players decreases by half each round (assuming it's a balanced binary tree). But maybe for the purposes of maximizing the number of games, the structure isn't a perfect binary tree but something more specific.\n\nWait, perhaps it's similar to a Fibonacci sequence. Because each new game the winner plays requires the opponent to have a certain number of prior games. For example, to have an opponent with k games, the winner must have either k-1 or k games before playing them.\n\nSo maybe the maximum number of games the winner can play is related to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nLet me see. Let's denote f(k) as the maximum number of games a player can play when starting from k opponents.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a Fibonacci-like problem. Let's think recursively. To maximize the number of games, the winner should face opponents who have played as many games as possible.\n\nFor example, the first game is against someone who hasn't played any games. Then, the next game is against someone who has played exactly one game, and so on.\n\nWait, no. Because each time the winner plays, their opponent must have a number of games that's either equal or differs by one from the winner's current count.\n\nSo let's model the process:\n\nLet's say the winner starts with 0 games. They play their first match. Now, they have 1 game. The opponent must have had 0 or 1 games before this match. But since they were in a knockout, the opponent must have come through previous rounds, so if the tournament is arranged correctly, their opponent could have played 0 games before the final.\n\nWait, no. Because in a knockout tournament, each round halves the number of players. So the number of rounds is log2(n), but that's assuming a balanced binary tree structure.\n\nBut perhaps for the purpose of maximizing the winner's games, the tournament isn't necessarily balanced. Instead, the winner can play against opponents in a way that allows them to have as many games as possible.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the largest k such that the sum of the series (like 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + ...) equals n.\n\nWait, perhaps it's similar to the Fibonacci sequence because each step depends on the previous steps.\n\nLet me consider the following approach. Let's model the maximum number of games as the length of a sequence where each step adds a number that is the sum of the previous two numbers.\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, the maximum number of games is the maximum m such that the sum of the first m terms of a certain sequence is less than or equal to n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of games is the largest m for which the (m+2)-th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to n.\n\nWait, let's think about small cases.\n\nFor example:\n\nn=2: 1 game. The max games is 1.\n\nn=3: 2 games. The winner plays two matches.\n\nn=4: The winner can play 2 games. How? Like, arrange the matches as follows:\n\nRound 1: 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4. Winners are 1 and 3.\n\nRound 2: 1 vs 3. So the winner plays two games.\n\nWait, but could he play more? What if the structure is different?\n\nAlternatively, another approach: each time the winner plays, the opponent must have either the same number of wins or one less.\n\nSo, the winner's game count increases each time.\n\nLet me model the winner's path:\n\nGame 1: plays against someone with 0 games. So the winner now has 1 game.\n\nGame 2: plays against someone who has 0 or 1 games. But if the opponent had 0 games, that's possible. So after game 2, the winner has 2 games.\n\nGame 3: opponent must have 1 or 2 games. Suppose opponent had 1: then the winner can play, increasing to 3.\n\nBut wait, how do those opponents get into the tournament?\n\nEach opponent that the winner faces must have gone through their own matches, which may have required them to have played a certain number of games.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum number of games the winner can play is the maximum m such that the sum of a certain series is <= n.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum is determined by the minimal Fibonacci-like approach.\n\nLet me think of it as a recursive problem. The maximum number of games the winner can play is the maximum m such that the sum of the first m terms of the Fibonacci sequence is <= n.\n\nWait, maybe not exactly, but perhaps a similar approach.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern.\n\nCompute for various n what the maximum games are.\n\nn=2:1\n\nn=3:2\n\nn=4:2\n\nn=5:3?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nn=5.\n\nPossible arrangement:\n\nThe winner needs to play 3 games. How?\n\nFirst game: plays 0 games. Then, second game: plays 1 game. Third game: plays 2 games.\n\nSo the opponents would have 0,1,2 games before facing the winner.\n\nBut wait, how do the opponents get to that state.\n\nAfter the first game, the winner has 1 game. The opponent is eliminated.\n\nThen, the second game is against someone who has 1 game. So the winner now has 2.\n\nThen, the third game is against someone who has 2 games. So the winner has 3.\n\nSo total players used: 1 (first game) + 1 (second game) + 1 (third game) = 3. Wait, but n=5.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm not accounting for all the players.\n\nWait, the initial setup for the third game: the opponent has 2 games. How many players are needed to have someone with 2 games.\n\nBecause each game in the tournament can only be played between two players, so each game reduces the count by 1.\n\nWait, the total number of games in the tournament is n-1, since it's knockout.\n\nBut the problem is about the maximum games the winner plays, regardless of others.\n\nSo for n=5, the winner can play 3 games.\n\nHow?\n\nLet me think:\n\nRound 1: 1 plays 2 → winner is 1 (game count 1).\n\nRound 2: 1 plays 3 → winner is 1 (game count 2).\n\nRound 3: 1 plays 4 → but 4 hasn't played any games. So can they play? Yes, because the difference is 2 (winner has 2, 4 has 0). Wait, no, because 2 - 0 = 2 >1. So that's not allowed.\n\nAh, right, so the opponent must have a game count that differs by at most one.\n\nSo in round 3, the opponent must have 1 or 2 games.\n\nSo to have a third game, the opponent must have 2 games.\n\nSo how do we arrange that.\n\nPerhaps the structure is:\n\nRound 1: 1 vs 2 → 1 advances (count 1).\n\nRound 2: 1 vs 3 → 1 advances (count 2).\n\nRound 3: 1 vs someone who has 2 games.\n\nBut to have someone with 2 games, they must have won two matches themselves.\n\nSo how many players are needed for that?\n\nLet me model this.\n\nOpponent 4: to have 2 games, they must have beaten two other players.\n\nSo in their path:\n\nRound 1a: 4 vs 5 → 4 wins (count 1).\n\nRound 1b: 4 vs someone else (say, 6) → 4 wins (count 2).\n\nBut wait, n=5. So the opponent can't be 6, because n=5.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me think for n=5.\n\nIf the winner can play 3 games, the opponent for the third game must have played 2 games.\n\nSo, the opponent (player 4) must have played two games.\n\nHow does that happen?\n\nPlayer 4 needs to win two matches to reach 2 games.\n\nSo, in the first round, 4 plays someone, say 5: 4 wins, count 1.\n\nIn the second round, 4 plays another person, say 6: but n=5, so that's impossible. Hmm, so perhaps the opponent for the third game cannot be in n=5.\n\nWait, maybe n=5 is too small.\n\nWait, perhaps for n=5, the maximum is 2 games.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting stuck. Let's think differently.\n\nI recall that the maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest m such that the (m+2)th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to n.\n\nWait, let's test this hypothesis.\n\nFibonacci sequence starts as 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a shifted version. Let me see:\n\nFor n=2: the maximum is 1.\n\nWhat's the Fibonacci index here? Let's see:\n\nLooking for the largest m where F(m+2) <= n.\n\nWait, maybe not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum m is the largest such that the sum of the first m terms of a certain sequence is <=n.\n\nWait, another approach: the maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest m where the (m+1)th term in a certain sequence is <=n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum m is the largest number where the sum of the first m terms is <=n, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input 3 is 10, output is 4.\n\nWait, let's compute the Fibonacci-like sequence for m=4.\n\nWhat's the sum for m=4?\n\nWait, perhaps the sequence is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.\n\nWait, for m=4: 1+1+2+3=7, which is less than 10. Then for m=5: sum is 13, which is larger than 10.\n\nBut the output is 4, which suggests that for n=10, the maximum is 4.\n\nWait, that aligns with m=4, sum being 7 <=10.\n\nWait, but then what about n=10, the maximum is 4.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum number of games is the largest m such that the sum of the first m terms of the Fibonacci sequence (starting from 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, etc.) is <=n.\n\nWait, let's compute the sum for m=4: 1+1+2+3=7.\n\nBut 7 is less than 10. So why is the output 4 for n=10?\n\nWait, perhaps the sum is not the correct measure. Alternatively, perhaps each term represents the number of players required for the winner to play m games.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of players required for the winner to have m games is Fib(m+2) -1, or something similar.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nEach time the winner plays a game, the opponent must have played either the same number of games or one less.\n\nSo for the first game, the opponent has 0 games. After that, the winner has 1.\n\nSecond game: opponent must have 0 or 1. If opponent has 1, that means they have played one game, which implies they have beaten someone else.\n\nThird game: opponent can have 1 or 2 games.\n\nSo for the third game, the opponent could have 2 games, meaning they have beaten two people.\n\nSo for the third game, we need three players (the winner, the opponent, and the two they beat).\n\nWait, perhaps the number of players required for m games is Fib(m+2) -1.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nFor m=1: Fib(3)=2. 2-1=1. So 1 player, but we need 2 (the two players in the game). Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's Fib(m+2) >= n.\n\nWait, for m=4, Fib(6)=8. So if n=10 is larger than 8, can the maximum m be 4?\n\nYes, because 8 is less than 10.\n\nWait, what's the maximum m where Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nFor n=10, Fib(6)=8 <=10, Fib(7)=13>10. So m+2=6, m=4.\n\nWhich aligns with the sample.\n\nSimilarly, for n=5: Fib(6)=8>5, so m+2=5, m=3. But Fib(5)=5 <=5, so m+2=5→m=3.\n\nSo for n=5, the maximum is 3.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought for n=5, it's unclear.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum m is the largest integer where Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nSo the approach is to find the largest m where Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nThus, the solution is to compute the maximum m such that Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nNow, the task is to compute this for a given n.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute the Fibonacci sequence until the value exceeds n.\n\n2. For each m, check if Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\n3. Find the largest m where this condition holds.\n\n4. Output m.\n\nBut wait, let's test this against the samples.\n\nSample 1: n=2.\n\nFib(3)=2<=2, so m+2=3→m=1. Correct.\n\nSample 2: n=3.\n\nFib(4)=3<=3, m=2. Correct.\n\nSample 3: n=4.\n\nFib(4)=3<=4, m=2. Correct.\n\nSample 4: n=10.\n\nFib(6)=8<=10, m=4. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5.\n\nFib(5)=5<=5, so m=3.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nYes, as per earlier thoughts.\n\nSo the plan is to precompute Fibonacci numbers up to n, find the largest m where Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nWait, but what if n is not a Fibonacci number?\n\nLike n=6.\n\nFib(6)=8>6. So m+2=5, Fib(5)=5<=6. So m=3.\n\nSo the maximum is 3.\n\nBut let's see: can the winner play 3 games with n=6.\n\nYes.\n\nFirst game: 0 games.\n\nSecond: 1 game.\n\nThird: 2 games.\n\nSo the opponents for each game are:\n\nGame 1: someone with 0.\n\nGame 2: someone with 1.\n\nGame 3: someone with 2.\n\nSo the total players needed is 1 (game1) + 1 (game2) + 2 (game3) = 4, but wait, that's not enough for n=6.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the required number of players.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of players required is Fib(m+2) -1.\n\nWait, for m=3: Fib(5)=5, so players required 5-1=4.\n\nWhich is less than n=6, so it's possible.\n\nSo yes, the maximum is 3.\n\nSo the approach seems valid.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCompute the Fibonacci sequence until the value exceeds n.\n\nFor each m, check whether Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nThe maximum such m is the answer.\n\nSo, now, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nWe can generate the Fibonacci sequence iteratively, starting with Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, etc.\n\nWait, no, wait, what's Fib(1), Fib(2), etc.\n\nWait, in our case, the m is based on Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nFor m=1: Fib(3)=2.\n\nm=2: Fib(4)=3.\n\nm=3: Fib(5)=5.\n\nm=4: Fib(6)=8.\n\nm=5: Fib(7)=13.\n\nSo the starting points are Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, etc.\n\nSo we can start generating Fib from 2 upwards.\n\nWe can create a list where each element is Fib(i) for i starting from 3.\n\nWe'll keep track of the current Fib value and compare with n.\n\nOnce the Fib value exceeds n, we stop.\n\nThen, we can iterate backwards to find the maximum m where Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nAlternatively, since the Fib sequence grows exponentially, for n up to 1018, the maximum m won't be very large.\n\nSo the code can be structured as:\n\nInitialize a and b as Fib(3) and Fib(4), respectively.\n\nThen, while b <=n, increment m, and set a, b as the next Fib numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps better to represent the Fib sequence as follows:\n\nfib = [2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...]\n\nWhere fib[0] is 2, which corresponds to m=1.\n\nWait, maybe I should reindex properly.\n\nLet me think of m as the index.\n\nWe can model the process as follows:\n\nWe need to find the maximum m where Fib(m+2) <=n.\n\nSo, for each m starting from 0, compute Fib(m+2) and check if it's <=n.\n\nOnce Fib(m+2) exceeds n, stop.\n\nThe maximum m is the last one that satisfies the condition.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe can initialize variables a, b as the first two Fib numbers beyond 2.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nWe can start with Fib(3) = 2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, etc.\n\nWe can have variables prev_prev, prev.\n\nprev_prev = 2 (Fib(3)).\n\nprev = 3 (Fib(4)).\n\ncurrent_m =1.\n\nmax_m =0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to iterate, keeping track of the current Fib value and its position.\n\nWait, let's think of it as:\n\nWe start with m=1, Fib(3)=2.\n\nIf 2 <=n, then m=1 is possible.\n\nThen, for m=2, Fib(4)=3.\n\nCheck if 3<=n.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo the code can be:\n\nRead n.\n\nInitialize a=2, b=3, m=1.\n\nif a >n: then m=0.\n\nelse:\n\n   while b <=n:\n\n       m +=1\n\n       a, b = b, a + b\n\n   m -=1\n\nSo for n=2: a=2 <=2, so m=1.\n\nCheck b=3>2: loop doesn't run. So m remains 1.\n\nOutput 1.\n\nFor n=3: a=2<=3.\n\nb=3<=3: m becomes 2.\n\nThen, a=3, b=5.\n\n5>3: loop stops.\n\nSo m=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nFor n=4: a=2<=4.\n\nb=3<=4: m=2.\n\nNext, a=3, b=5>4. Loop stops.\n\nSo m=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nFor n=5:\n\na=2<=5.\n\nb=3<=5: m=2.\n\na=3, b=5<=5: m=3.\n\na=5, b=8>5: loop stops.\n\nSo m=3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nFor n=10:\n\na=2<=10.\n\nb=3<=10: m=2.\n\na=3, b=5<=10: m=3.\n\na=5, b=8<=10: m=4.\n\na=8, b=13>10: loop stops.\n\nSo m=4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=6.\n\na=2<=6.\n\nb=3<=6: m=2.\n\na=3, b=5<=6: m=3.\n\na=5, b=8>6: loop stops.\n\nm=3.\n\nSo the maximum is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=7.\n\na=2.\n\nb=3: m=2.\n\na=3, b=5<=7: m=3.\n\na=5, b=8>7: loop stops.\n\nm=3.\n\nSo for n=7, maximum is 3.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases correctly.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n- Start with a=2, b=3, m=1.\n\n- While b <=n:\n\n   - m +=1\n\n   - compute next Fib: a, b = b, a + b.\n\n- After loop, m is the maximum.\n\nBut wait, no. Because initially, a=2, which is Fib(3), and m is 1.\n\nEach iteration increases m by 1, but the next Fib is Fib(m+2).\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, in the code, for each step:\n\nInitially, a=Fib(3), b=Fib(4). m=1.\n\nThen, in the loop, when we compute a and b, we're adding to get the next Fib.\n\nEach time, m increases by 1, which represents the Fib(m+2) increasing.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is correct.\n\nWait, let's simulate for n=2.\n\nInitial a=2, b=3, m=1.\n\nCheck if b (3) <=2? No. So loop doesn't run.\n\nm remains 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nFor n=3.\n\na=2, b=3, m=1.\n\nb=3<=3: enter loop.\n\nm becomes 2.\n\na=3, b=5.\n\nCheck if 5<=3? No. Exit.\n\nSo m=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5.\n\nInitial a=2, b=3, m=1.\n\nb=3<=5: enter loop.\n\nm=2.\n\na=3, b=5.\n\nb=5<=5: enter loop.\n\nm=3.\n\na=5, b=8.\n\nCheck 8>5: exit.\n\nSo m=3.\n\nCorrect.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nImplement this logic in Python.\n\nRead n from stdin.\n\nCompute the maximum m as described.\n\nPrint m.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nRead n.\n\nHandle n=1: but according to the problem statement, n >=2.\n\nSo proceed.\n\nInitialize a=2, b=3, m=1.\n\nIf a >n: then m=0.\n\nElse:\n\n   while b <=n:\n\n       m +=1\n\n       a, b = b, a+b\n\nSo after the loop, m is the maximum.\n\nWait, but in the code, initially, a=2, which is Fib(3).\n\nSo for n=2, m=1.\n\nFor n=3, m=2.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, no, in the code, the initial m is 1.\n\nBut in the code, when a=2 and b=3.\n\nIf b is <=n, then m increases by 1, and a and b are updated.\n\nBut for n=2, b=3>2, so loop doesn't run, m remains 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTesting the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input: 2 3 4 10 → outputs 1, 2, 2,4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code will read n, and print m.\n\nSo, the code is:\n\nn = int(input())\nif n == 1:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    a, b = 2, 3\n    m = 1\n    if a > n:\n        m = 0\n    else:\n        while b <= n:\n            m += 1\n            a, b = b, a + b\n    print(m)\n\nWait, but wait, for n=1, the problem says n>=2. So the code can ignore that case.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nn = int(input())\na, b = 2, 3\nm = 1\nif a > n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    while b <= n:\n        m +=1\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    print(m)\n\nWait, but wait:\n\nWait for n=3, the code sets a=2, b=3, m=1.\n\nSince b <=n, enter loop.\n\nm becomes 2.\n\na becomes 3, b becomes 5.\n\nNow, 5>3: loop exits.\n\nPrint m=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5.\n\na=2, b=3.\n\nLoop: b=3<=5 → m=2, a=3, b=5.\n\nb=5<=5 → m=3, a=5, b=8.\n\nb=8>5 → exit.\n\nPrint 3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test: n=6.\n\na=2, b=3.\n\nLoop runs for b=3 and 5.\n\nm increments to 2 and 3.\n\na=5, b=8>6. So m=3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test: n=7.\n\nSame as above.\n\nn=8.\n\na=2, b=3.\n\nLoop:\n\nb=3 <=8 → m=2, a=3, b=5.\n\nb=5 <=8 → m=3, a=5, b=8.\n\nb=8 <=8 → m=4, a=8, b=13.\n\nb=13>8 → loop exits.\n\nPrint 4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given that two players can only face each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the problem can be modeled using the Fibonacci sequence. The maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by finding the largest number \\( m \\) such that the (m+2)-th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to the number of players \\( n \\).\n\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: Each game the winner plays requires opponents who have played either the same number of games or one fewer. This structure aligns with the Fibonacci sequence, where each term is the sum of the two preceding ones.\n2. **Iterative Calculation**: We generate Fibonacci numbers iteratively until the value exceeds \\( n \\). The largest \\( m \\) such that the (m+2)-th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to \\( n \\) gives us the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na, b = 2, 3\nm = 1\nif a > n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    while b <= n:\n        m += 1\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    print(m)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start with the third and fourth Fibonacci numbers (2 and 3) and initialize the count of games \\( m \\) to 1.\n2. **Loop Until Exceeding \\( n \\)**: We generate subsequent Fibonacci numbers in a loop, incrementing \\( m \\) each time. The loop continues until the current Fibonacci number exceeds \\( n \\).\n3. **Output Result**: After exiting the loop, \\( m \\) holds the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of games using properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of \\( n \\leq 1018 \\).",
