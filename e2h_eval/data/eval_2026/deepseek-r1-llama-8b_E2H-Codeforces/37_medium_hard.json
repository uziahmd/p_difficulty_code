    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find a permutation of an array such that for every non-empty subset of indices (excluding the full set and empty set), the sum in the original array and the permuted array are different. Hmm, that's a bit tricky.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem again. We're given an array 'a' with 'n' distinct integers. We need to rearrange them into array 'b' such that for any non-empty subset S (where 1 ≤ k < n), the sum of elements in positions S of 'a' is different from the sum of elements in the same positions of 'b'. \n\nWait, right. So for every possible non-empty subset that isn't the entire array, the sum must be unique between 'a' and 'b'. \n\nFirst, I should think about what this implies. The sum of all subsets must be unique in some way. But since 'b' is a permutation, maybe we can find a way to arrange the elements so that no two subsets of the same size (or any size) have the same sum in both arrays.\n\nBut wait, it's not just about the same size. It's any subset, regardless of size, except the ones that are empty or the entire array.\n\nSo how can I approach this? Maybe by ensuring that each subset has a unique sum, but that's probably impossible for larger n. However, the constraints say n is up to 22. Oh, 22 is manageable with bitmask techniques, but 2^22 is around 4 million, which is a lot but perhaps manageable for certain approaches.\n\nHmm, but for n=22, the number of possible non-empty subsets is 2^22 - 2, which is about 4 million. For each of those subsets, we need to make sure that the sum in 'a' is different from the sum in 'b'.\n\nWait, but for each subset S, sum_a(S) != sum_b(S). Since 'b' is a permutation, sum_b(S) is the sum of the elements at the positions in S, but arranged differently.\n\nSo, one approach could be to assign elements to 'b' such that for any subset S, the sum of 'a' at S is not equal to the sum of 'b' at S.\n\nBut how do I find such a permutation?\n\nMaybe I can model this as a graph problem. Each element in 'a' can be placed in 'b' in such a way that for any subset, their sums don't collide. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to ensure that for each position i, the element in 'b' is such that when considering all possible subsets, the sums are unique. But that seems vague.\n\nAnother thought: the condition must hold for all non-empty proper subsets. So, for each subset S, the sum of a[S] and the sum of b[S] must differ. \n\nWait, but the sum of a[S] is fixed. So, for each subset S, the sum in 'b' must be different from the sum in 'a'. So, if for any S, the sum of elements in S in 'a' equals the sum in 'b', then it's invalid.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding a permutation 'b' where for every non-empty proper subset S, sum_b(S) != sum_a(S).\n\nHmm, so perhaps the approach is to generate all possible permutations and check each one whether it satisfies the condition. But for n=22, that's 22! possibilities, which is way too big—about 1e23, which is completely impossible.\n\nSo brute force is out of the question. I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the properties that 'b' must have. What makes two subsets S and T have the same sum in 'a' and 'b'? If for some S, the sum of elements in S in 'a' equals the sum in 'b', that's a problem.\n\nWait, another angle: the sum of all subsets of 'a' is unique in some way. So perhaps if the elements in 'b' are arranged such that for any subset S, the sum in 'b' is different from the sum in 'a'.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the linear algebra perspective. Each element in 'b' must be chosen such that for any subset S, the sum in 'b' is different. This feels similar to ensuring that the vectors (sums) are unique, but I'm not exactly sure how to apply that here.\n\nWait, maybe another idea: the problem requires that for any subset S, sum_b(S) != sum_a(S). So, the sum of any subset in 'a' cannot be equal to the sum of the corresponding subset in 'b'.\n\nIf I consider the multiset of all possible subset sums of 'a', then the subset sums of 'b' must not intersect with this multiset, except for the empty set and the full set.\n\nBut that's a huge number of subsets—so perhaps the only way this is possible is if the permutation 'b' is such that the subset sums are all different from those of 'a'.\n\nBut again, how to construct such a permutation?\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be rephrased as: the permutation must be such that for every non-empty proper subset S, sum_b(S) ≠ sum_a(S). \n\nAnother approach: think about the difference between 'a' and 'b'. For each position i, let b_i = a_{p(i)}, where p is a permutation. Then, for any subset S, the sum of b_i for i in S must not equal the sum of a_i for i in S.\n\nHmm. Let me think about small cases first.\n\nFor example, in the sample input:\n\nInput is [2], but wait, no, wait the sample input is n=2, a = [1,2]. So possible permutations are [1,2] and [2,1].\n\nThe output is [2,1], which gives for subset {1}: a[0]=1, b[0]=2 → different. For subset {2}: a[1]=2, b[1]=1 → different. For subset {1,2}: a sum is 3, b sum is 3 → but this subset is excluded because it's the entire array. So it's okay.\n\nSo in this case, the permutation works because for all non-empty proper subsets, the sum is different.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nWhat's the key property that 'b' must have? It needs to have all the same subset sums as 'a' for the empty and full sets, but none of the other subsets.\n\nWait, but the problem says that for all non-empty proper subsets, the sum in 'a' is different from the sum in 'b'. So for any subset S (non-empty, not the whole array), sum_a(S) ≠ sum_b(S).\n\nSo, perhaps the way to achieve this is to arrange 'b' such that the subset sums are entirely different. One way is to make sure that for each subset S, the sum in 'b' is not equal to the sum in 'a'.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the differences between the subsets.\n\nSuppose that for each element in 'b', it's placed such that any subset's sum in 'b' doesn't match that in 'a'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be transformed into finding a permutation where the sum of any subset in 'b' is different from the sum of the same subset in 'a'.\n\nThis seems like a very strict condition, but perhaps it's achievable for certain arrays.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a kind of derangement problem, where each element is moved in a way that avoids certain conditions.\n\nBut I'm not seeing the connection clearly.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps for each position i, assign b_i such that for any subset S containing i, the sum in 'b' is not equal to the sum in 'a'.\n\nBut that's too vague.\n\nWait, let me think about the binary representation. For each element, the presence or absence in a subset contributes to the sum. So, for each subset, the sum is a function of which elements are included.\n\nBut how does permuting the elements affect the sums of subsets?\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to ensure that for each subset S, the sum in 'b' is different from the sum in 'a'. To achieve this, perhaps the permutation must be such that the sum of any subset in 'b' is not equal to the sum in 'a' for that subset.\n\nThis is similar to the concept of a \"derangement,\" but more complex.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be considered as a constraint satisfaction problem. Each permutation is a possible solution, and the constraints are that for every non-empty proper subset S, sum_b(S) ≠ sum_a(S).\n\nBut again, the number of permutations is too high for n=22, so this approach isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet me think about the problem differently. For the permutation to satisfy the condition, the following must hold:\n\nFor any two distinct subsets S and T (both non-empty, neither is the full set), if S is a subset of T, then the sum in 'a' for S is less than the sum in 'a' for T. Similarly, in 'b', the sum for S must be less than the sum for T.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. It depends on the elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the arrangement of elements in 'b' should be such that the sum of any subset in 'b' is not equal to the sum in 'a' for the same subset.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to achieve this is to arrange the elements in 'b' in such a way that their subset sums are unique and different from those in 'a'. But how?\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe if the elements in 'b' are arranged in a specific order, like sorted in a certain way, the subset sums can be controlled.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to assigning each element in 'b' such that for each position i, the element is not in a position j where swapping would cause a subset's sum to collide.\n\nBut again, I'm not making progress.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nGiven that n is up to 22, perhaps a bitmask-based approach is feasible, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but even 22 bits is 4 million subsets. Checking each subset for each permutation is impossible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem can be transformed into checking whether there exists a permutation where for every subset S, the sum of 'a' and 'b' over S are different. \n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be approached by trying to find a permutation where for each subset S (non-empty, not full), the sum of S in 'a' is not equal to the sum in 'b'.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach: For each element, decide whether to place it in 'b' in a position such that for any subset that includes it, the sum is changed.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the differences between the sum in 'a' and 'b' for all subsets. But that's abstract.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe problem is equivalent to ensuring that for every non-empty proper subset S, the sum of 'a' over S is not equal to the sum of 'b' over S.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as: for every S, sum_{i in S} a_i != sum_{i in S} b_i.\n\nBut since 'b' is a permutation of 'a', the sum of all elements in 'a' and 'b' are the same. Because the total sum is the same, the sum over the entire array is the same in both, but for subsets, they can vary.\n\nWait, but for each subset S, sum_b(S) can be anything, as long as it's not equal to sum_a(S).\n\nSo, perhaps the way to arrange 'b' is such that for each subset S, sum_b(S) is different from sum_a(S).\n\nNow, how can I construct such a permutation?\n\nIdea: Maybe assign each element to 'b' in a way that for each element, it's placed in a position where it doesn't create a collision in any subset.\n\nBut this is still vague.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps the problem can be transformed into a graph where each node represents a state of a permutation being built, and edges represent adding an element to a position. Then, we can use backtracking to try permutations and check the constraints. But for n=22, this is impossible.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem requires a mathematical insight.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is related to the concept of \"subset-sum avoiding\" permutations. \n\nIn other words, a permutation is such that no subset has the same sum in both arrays.\n\nBut I'm not aware of any existing algorithm or method for this.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that the sum of any subset in 'a' and 'b' must be different. Therefore, the sum of any subset in 'b' must not be present in the sum list of 'a' subsets.\n\nThus, the sum list of 'b' must be disjoint from the sum list of 'a', except for the empty set and the full set.\n\nWait, but the sum lists are of all possible subsets. So, for 'b', the subset sums must not include any of the sums from 'a' except for the empty and full subsets.\n\nBut that's a very strict condition.\n\nWait, but the sum of the empty subset is zero, and the sum of the full subset is the total sum of 'a'. Since 'b' is a permutation, the sum of the full subset is the same as 'a's sum, so for the full subset, the sums are equal. But according to the problem statement, the full subset is excluded, so it's allowed.\n\nSo, the condition is that for every non-empty proper subset S, sum_b(S) is not equal to sum_a(S).\n\nHmm, perhaps the way to achieve this is to have 'b's subset sums be a superset of 'a's sums, but that's not possible because the sum of a subset can't exceed the total sum.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the sum of a subset in 'b' can't match any subset in 'a' except for the full and empty sets.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to ensure that for each non-empty proper subset S, the sum in 'b' is different from the sum in 'a' for S.\n\nHow can I ensure this? One way is to assign the elements in 'b' in such a way that for each subset S, the sum in 'b' is either greater or less than the sum in 'a'.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nPerhaps the problem can be solved by ensuring that for each position i, the element in 'b' is assigned to a position such that for any subset that includes i, the sum in 'b' is different from 'a'.\n\nBut again, this is too vague.\n\nWait, perhaps a necessary condition is that for each element a_j, it is placed in 'b' in a position where the sum of the elements before and after it in 'b' doesn't create a conflict.\n\nBut I'm not seeing how.\n\nAlternative Approach:\n\nPerhaps, instead of thinking about the permutation directly, I can model this as a problem of assigning each element to a new position, ensuring that for any subset S, the sum in 'b' is different.\n\nBut this seems too broad.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the problem requires that for every non-empty proper subset S, sum_b(S) != sum_a(S), perhaps the permutation 'b' must have all subset sums different from 'a's subset sums.\n\nBut how to construct such a permutation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that each element in 'b' is placed such that it breaks all possible subset sums that could collide.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is impossible for certain arrays. For example, if the array has elements such that a subset of them sums to the same value as another subset, then it's impossible to find a permutation 'b' that satisfies the condition.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, suppose in 'a', there exists two different subsets S and T, both non-empty and proper, such that sum_a(S) = sum_a(T). Then, in 'b', we need to ensure that sum_b(S) != sum_a(S) and sum_b(T) != sum_a(S). But since 'b' is a permutation, sum_b(S) can't be sum_a(S), but what about sum_b(T)?\n\nWait, but if sum_a(S) = sum_a(T), then in 'b', sum_b(S) can't be sum_a(S), and sum_b(T) can't be sum_a(S). So, as long as sum_b(S) and sum_b(T) are not equal to sum_a(S), it's acceptable.\n\nWait, but perhaps for some arrays, it's impossible. For example, if in 'a' there exists a subset S whose sum is equal to the sum of another subset T, and also, the same sum occurs in 'b' for some other subsets.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the array has distinct integers. So, the elements are all distinct, but subset sums may not be.\n\nBut perhaps for some arrays, it's possible to find such a permutation, and for others, it's not.\n\nSo, the first step is to determine whether it's possible to find such a permutation.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative Idea: Maybe the problem can be solved by assigning the elements in 'b' such that for each position i, the element is placed in a way that the prefix sums are unique. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, for example, if the prefix sums of 'b' are all different, then perhaps it's easier to avoid collisions.\n\nBut the problem requires more than just prefix sums; it's about all subsets.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nSince the problem requires that for every non-empty proper subset S, the sum in 'b' is different from 'a's sum, perhaps the easiest way is to construct 'b' such that for each element, the sum of the elements before it in 'b' is different from the sum in 'a' for any subset.\n\nBut again, I'm not making progress.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to realize that the condition is equivalent to ensuring that the sum of any non-empty proper subset in 'b' is not equal to the sum in 'a' for that subset.\n\nSo, the problem is to arrange 'b' such that for all S (non-empty, proper), sum_b(S) != sum_a(S).\n\nOne approach is to model this as a system of equations where for each subset S, sum_b(S) != sum_a(S). But the number of equations is 2^22 - 2, which is way too big.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps the problem can be solved by assigning each element to a new position in 'b' in a way that for each element, its placement doesn't allow any subset sum in 'b' to equal any subset sum in 'a'.\n\nBut without knowing how, I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached using dynamic programming. For each position in 'b', choose an element from 'a' that hasn't been used yet, and track some information that ensures that no subset sum collision occurs.\n\nBut what information to track? It's unclear.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the problem is about subset sums, perhaps the permutation 'b' must be such that the subset sums of 'b' are all different from the subset sums of 'a' for non-empty proper subsets.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAnother Idea: Let's think about the problem in terms of the characteristic function of the subsets. For each subset S, the sum in 'a' is s_a(S), and the sum in 'b' is s_b(S). We need s_b(S) != s_a(S) for all non-empty proper subsets S.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be transformed into ensuring that for each subset S, s_b(S) is not equal to s_a(S). How can I ensure that?\n\nWait, perhaps if the elements in 'b' are arranged such that the sum of any subset in 'b' is not present in the set of subset sums of 'a' (excluding the empty and full sets).\n\nBut how to achieve that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by trying to assign each element in 'b' such that for each element, it's placed in a way that all subsets including it have a sum different from 'a's.\n\nBut again, I'm not making progress.\n\nAlternative Idea: Maybe the problem can be simplified by considering that for any two subsets S and T, if S is a subset of T, then the sum in 'a' for S is less than the sum for T. Similarly, in 'b', the sum for S must be less than the sum for T.\n\nBut this is not necessarily true, as subset sums can vary based on the elements.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is related to the notion of \"superincreasing\" sequences, where each element is greater than the sum of all previous elements. In such a case, each subset sum is unique, which could help prevent collisions.\n\nBut the problem requires that subset sums in 'b' are different from those in 'a', not necessarily unique within 'b' themselves.\n\nHmm, but perhaps arranging 'b' in a superincreasing order could help, as the subset sums would be unique and might not coincide with those of 'a'.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by greedily assigning elements to 'b' in such a way that each assignment doesn't create any subset sum collision.\n\nBut again, the implementation is unclear.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the problem allows any permutation, perhaps the way to proceed is to try to construct 'b' incrementally, choosing elements for each position and ensuring that no subset sum collisions occur so far.\n\nBut for n=22, this would require a lot of backtracking, which is computationally expensive.\n\nWait, but perhaps for the given constraints, a bitmask-based approach with memoization can be used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a recursive backtracking approach where for each position, we try all possible unused elements, and for each choice, check whether any subset sum would collide.\n\nBut for n=22, the number of possibilities is too high.\n\nSo, perhaps this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Maybe the problem can be solved by checking whether the array 'a' has the property that all subset sums are unique, and then permuting it accordingly. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but the problem allows 'b' to have any subset sums as long as they don't collide with 'a's. So, perhaps if the subset sums of 'a' are unique, then any permutation will work, because 'b's subset sums will differ.\n\nBut no, because 'b' is a permutation of 'a', so the subset sums of 'b' are the same as 'a's. So that can't be.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 'b' is a permutation of 'a', so the sum of any subset S in 'a' is the same as the sum of the same subset S in 'b'. So, for example, the sum of the entire array is the same in both. So, the condition is that for all non-empty proper subsets S, sum_b(S) != sum_a(S).\n\nBut since 'b' is a permutation, for any subset S, the sum in 'b' is the same as the sum in 'a' for the same subset S. Wait, no, because in 'b', the elements are arranged differently, so the subset S in 'b' corresponds to a different subset in 'a'.\n\nWait, no. Because 'b' is a permutation, the sum of subset S in 'b' is the sum of the elements in positions S of 'b', which are a permutation of the elements of 'a'. So, it's possible that for a different subset S' in 'a', the sum in 'b' for S is equal to the sum in 'a' for S'.\n\nAh, that's the crux of the problem.\n\nSo, for example, in 'a', subset S1 has sum 5, subset S2 has sum 5. In 'b', subset S1' (which is a permutation of S1 in 'a') could have sum 5, which would conflict with S1's sum in 'a'.\n\nWait, but the problem says that for every non-empty proper subset S of indices in 'b', the sum in 'a' (original array) and 'b' (permuted array) must be different.\n\nNo, wait, the problem says that for every non-empty subset S of indices (in the same positions in 'a' and 'b'), the sum in 'a' and 'b' must be different.\n\nWait, no, the problem says that for every non-empty subset S (of the same indices in both arrays), the sum in 'a' and 'b' must be different.\n\nSo, for example, in 'a', the sum of the subset {1,3} is 10. In 'b', the sum of the subset {1,3} must be different from 10.\n\nBut 'b' is a permutation, so the subset {1,3} in 'b' contains elements from 'a', but arranged differently.\n\nSo, the problem is that for each subset S (same indices in both 'a' and 'b'), the sum of 'a'[S] must differ from the sum of 'b'[S].\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. So, for each subset S, the sum in 'a' and 'b' must be different.\n\nSo, the problem is not about the subset sums in 'a' and 'b' being different, but rather, for the same subset of indices, the sum in 'a' and 'b' must differ.\n\nThis changes everything.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input:\n\na = [1,2], b = [2,1].\n\nSubset {1}: a[0]=1, b[0]=2 → different.\n\nSubset {2}: a[1]=2, b[1]=1 → different.\n\nSubset {1,2}: a sum is 3, b sum is 3 → but this subset is excluded, so it's okay.\n\nSo, the condition is satisfied.\n\nSo, the problem is to arrange the elements in 'b' such that for every non-empty proper subset of indices, the sum of the elements in those positions in 'a' is different from the sum in 'b'.\n\nSo, the approach is to find a permutation where for each subset S (non-empty, not full), sum(S in a) != sum(S in b).\n\nBut how?\n\nNow, this seems more manageable. Because now, for each subset S, the sum in 'a' is fixed as sum_a(S), and we need to arrange 'b' such that for S, sum_b(S) != sum_a(S).\n\nSo, the problem is to arrange 'b' such that for each subset S (non-empty, not full), sum_b(S) != sum_a(S).\n\nThis is a much clearer condition.\n\nNow, perhaps the way to approach this is to model the problem as a graph where each node represents a partial permutation, and edges represent adding an element to a position, ensuring that for any subset S that includes this position, the sum doesn't collide.\n\nBut even then, for n=22, this seems difficult.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think about the problem in terms of linear algebra. Each element in 'b' can be placed in any position, but the sum of any subset S must not equal sum_a(S).\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to arrange 'b' such that for each position i, the element b_i is not equal to a_i when considering the subsets that include only i.\n\nBecause if b_i = a_i, then the subset {i} in 'a' has sum a_i, and in 'b' also a_i, which is a collision. So, to avoid this, we must have b_i != a_i for all i.\n\nThat's a necessary condition, but not sufficient.\n\nSo, the first step is to ensure that no element is placed in its original position. That is, 'b' must be a derangement of 'a'. \n\nWait, no, because the problem allows a_i to be placed in position j as long as the subset sums don't collide. So, perhaps b_i can be a_i, but in that case, the subset {i} would have sum a_i in both arrays, which is a collision. So, to avoid this, we must have b_i != a_i for all i.\n\nSo, 'b' must be a derangement of 'a'. So, the first condition is that a derangement exists.\n\nWait, but for n=1, a derangement is impossible. But the problem says n ≥ 1. So, for n=1, the output is impossible, since any permutation is the same as the original array, and the only subset is the entire array, which is excluded.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the output must print -1 if no such array exists. So, for n=1, it's impossible because the only possible permutation is the same as 'a', and the only non-empty proper subset is none (since n=1, the subsets are empty and the full set), so for n=1, the output is -1.\n\nSo, for n=1, output is -1.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, a derangement is possible if the two elements are different. Which is always the case since the array has distinct elements.\n\nWait, the problem states that the array has distinct elements, so for n≥2, a derangement exists.\n\nSo, for n≥2, the first step is to create a derangement of 'a', i.e., a permutation where no element is in its original position.\n\nBut is that sufficient? No, because it's possible that for some subset S with |S|>1, the sum of S in 'a' equals the sum in 'b'.\n\nSo, the derangement is a necessary condition but not sufficient.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding a derangement of 'a' such that for every non-empty proper subset S of indices, sum(S in a) != sum(S in b).\n\nSo, the next step is to find a derangement, and then check whether it satisfies the subset sum condition.\n\nBut for n=22, trying all possible derangements is computationally impossible.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to proceed is to construct a derangement where the subset sums for any non-empty proper subset S are different.\n\nAn alternative Idea: Perhaps the problem can be solved by placing the elements in 'b' in a way that the sum for any subset S in 'b' is not equal to the sum in 'a' for S.\n\nTo do this, perhaps we can arrange 'b' in a particular order, such as reversed order, and then check whether it satisfies the condition.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, let's think about the sample input.\n\nIn the sample, a is [1,2], and b is [2,1].\n\nFor subset {1}, sum_a is 1, sum_b is 2 → different.\n\nFor subset {2}, sum_a is 2, sum_b is 1 → different.\n\nSo, it's valid.\n\nAnother example: Suppose a is [3,1,2]. Can we find a permutation?\n\nLet's try b = [2,3,1].\n\nCheck subset {1}: a[0]=3, b[0]=2 → different.\n\nSubset {2}: a[1]=1, b[1]=3 → different.\n\nSubset {3}: a[2]=2, b[2]=1 → different.\n\nSubsets of size 2:\n\n{1,2}: a sum is 3+1=4; b sum is 2+3=5 → different.\n\n{1,3}: a sum 3+2=5; b sum 2+1=3 → different.\n\n{2,3}: a sum 1+2=3; b sum 3+1=4 → different.\n\nSubsets of size 3: excluded.\n\nSo, this permutation works.\n\nBut what if the array is such that in the derangement, a subset S has sum equal to sum in 'a'?\n\nFor example, let's say a is [1, 3, 2].\n\nA derangement could be [3, 1, 2].\n\nCheck subset {1}: a[0]=1, b[0]=3 → different.\n\nSubset {2}: a[1]=3, b[1]=1 → different.\n\nSubset {3}: a[2]=2, b[2]=2 → same. So, this permutation is invalid because subset {3} in 'b' has the same sum as in 'a'.\n\nSo, this permutation is invalid.\n\nThus, the derangement is necessary but not sufficient. We need to find a derangement where for every non-empty proper subset S, the sum of 'b' in S is not equal to the sum of 'a' in S.\n\nSo, the problem becomes finding a derangement (permutation with no fixed points) that also satisfies the subset sum condition.\n\nNow, how can we find such a permutation?\n\nAn Idea:\n\nPerhaps the problem can be approached by trying to arrange the elements in 'b' such that for each position i, the element is placed in a way that for any subset that includes i, the sum in 'b' is different from 'a's.\n\nBut it's unclear how to implement this.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the problem requires that for every subset S, the sum in 'a' and 'b' are different, perhaps the way to proceed is to find a permutation where for each element, it is placed in a position j such that for any subset S containing j, the sum of 'a' and 'b' for S is different.\n\nBut again, this is vague.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's think about the problem in terms of linear algebra. Each subset S imposes a constraint that sum_b(S) != sum_a(S). So, for each subset S, sum_b(S) - sum_a(S) ≠ 0.\n\nBut sum_b(S) is the sum of the elements in S of 'b', which are a permutation of 'a's elements. So, sum_b(S) is equal to the sum of the elements in S of 'a', but arranged differently.\n\nWait, no. Because in 'b', the elements are arranged differently, so the subset S in 'b' refers to the same indices as in 'a'. So, the sum in 'b' is the sum of the elements in those indices in 'b', which are a permutation of 'a's elements.\n\nThus, for each subset S, sum_b(S) is the sum of the elements in S in 'b', which are a permutation of 'a's elements. So, sum_b(S) is not fixed, but depends on the permutation.\n\nThus, the problem is to find a permutation 'b' such that for every non-empty proper subset S, sum_b(S) != sum_a(S).\n\nNow, how can I find such a permutation?\n\nAnother Idea: Since the problem requires that for every subset S, sum_b(S) is not equal to sum_a(S), perhaps the way to proceed is to ensure that for each element, when placed in 'b', it doesn't form any subset sum that collides.\n\nBut again, it's unclear.\n\nAlternative Idea: Maybe the problem can be approached by considering the inclusion of each element in 'b' and ensuring that for any subset S that includes it, the sum is changed.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps it's best to write a backtracking solution that tries to find a permutation 'b' where no subset S (non-empty, proper) has sum_b(S) == sum_a(S). \n\nBut for n=22, this is impossible. So, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that for small n, a backtracking approach is feasible, but for larger n, a different approach is needed.\n\nWait, but the problem says n can be up to 22, so a backtracking approach is not feasible.\n\nThus, I need a smarter approach.\n\nAnother Idea: Let me think about the problem in terms of linear algebra. Each element in 'b' is a variable, and for each subset S, the sum of variables in S must not equal sum_a(S).\n\nBut this is a system of inequalities, which is difficult to solve.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding a permutation 'b' such that for each position i, the element in 'b' is not part of any subset S where sum_a(S) is equal to the sum of 'b'(S). \n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the problem can be approached by ensuring that for each element, it's placed in a position such that it doesn't allow any subset sum to collide. For example, placing larger elements early or late to control the subset sums.\n\nBut again, it's unclear.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the problem is quite challenging, perhaps the solution involves a clever observation or mathematical property that I'm missing.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the problem requires that for every non-empty proper subset S, sum_b(S) != sum_a(S). So, the sum of any subset S in 'b' must be different from the sum in 'a' for the same subset S.\n\nThis implies that for each subset S, the sum of the elements in S in 'b' must not equal the sum of the elements in S in 'a'. \n\nSo, perhaps the way to arrange 'b' is to swap elements in such a way that for any subset S, the sum in 'b' is not equal to 'a's sum.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe the problem can be approached by looking for a permutation where the sum of any subset S is unique across all subsets. But that's not necessary, just that for each S, the sum in 'b' is different from 'a's sum.\n\nWait, but that's exactly the condition.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to find a permutation where for each subset S, sum_b(S) != sum_a(S).\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps the solution is to construct 'b' such that for each position i, the element in 'b' is not a_i, and for any subset S, the sum of 'b' in S is different from 'a's.\n\nBut again, without knowing how to do this, it's difficult.\n\nAlternative Idea: Maybe the problem can be transformed into ensuring that the permutation 'b' has the same multiset of subset sums as 'a' except",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find a permutation of an array such that for every non-empty subset of indices (excluding the full set and empty set), the sum of elements in the original array and the permuted array are different. \n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves the following steps:\n1. **Check for Derangement**: Ensure that no element remains in its original position, as this would cause the subset sum for that single element to be the same in both arrays.\n2. **Backtracking with Pruning**: Use a recursive backtracking approach to generate permutations of the array, ensuring that for each subset, the sum does not match between the original and permuted arrays.
