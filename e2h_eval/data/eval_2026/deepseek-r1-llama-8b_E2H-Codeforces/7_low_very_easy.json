The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine for a given number n whether it's possible to construct a snowflake graph as defined. The snowflake is built in a certain way, and I have to figure out for each test case if such a snowflake exists.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe snowflake is an undirected graph constructed as follows:\n\n- Start with one vertex.\n- Then, connect this initial vertex to k new vertices, where k > 1.\n- Each vertex that has only one edge (so, those added in the previous steps) must be connected to k new vertices. This step must be done at least once.\n\nWait, so the process is: initially, the root (vertex 1) connects to k children. Then, each of those k children (since they are leaves) will each connect to k new nodes. But this step needs to be done at least once. So the minimal case is when after the first expansion, we do another expansion on all the leaves.\n\nSo for example, for k=4, the minimal snowflake has 1 + 4*(1 + 4) = 1 +4*5=21? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I should model the total number of nodes.\n\nEach time we perform a \"step\", which is adding k children to each leaf node. The initial step adds k nodes. Then, each step adds more nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps the snowflake is built in layers. Let's think of it as a tree structure.\n\nThe root is level 0. Then, the next level has k nodes. Then, each of those has k children, so level 2 has k^2 nodes. But wait, the process must be done at least once. So the minimal steps are two: initial plus one expansion.\n\nWait, no. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nThe process starts with one vertex. Then, the initial vertex is connected to k new ones. That's step one. Then, each vertex connected by only one edge (so the ones just added) must be connected to k new ones. And this step must be done at least once.\n\nSo the minimal structure is when after the first step (adding k nodes), we do another step where each of those k nodes adds k new nodes. So the total number of nodes would be 1 (root) + k (level 1) + k*k (level 2). So that's 1 +k +k².\n\nBut wait, maybe the process can have more than two steps. Like, after the second step, each of those level 2 nodes would also add k children, but the problem says that the step must be done at least once. So the minimal is two steps beyond the initial.\n\nWait, no. The initial step is the first expansion. Then, the step is done at least once. So for example, the minimal is initial step (adding k nodes), then one more expansion step (each of those adds k nodes, leading to k^2 added). So the total nodes would be 1 +k +k².\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial step is considered the first step, and then the expansion step is done once or more. So the minimal is when the expansion is done once.\n\nWait, the problem says the step should be done at least once. So the minimal case is when the initial step is done (adding k nodes), and then the expansion is done once.\n\nSo the total nodes would be 1 +k +k².\n\nBut let's see the sample input and output to get an idea.\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\nSample Output:\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nWait, for n=6: output is YES.\n\nWait, what's 6? Let's see.\n\nIf n=6, perhaps k=2.\n\nBecause 1 +2 +2²=1+2+4=7, which is larger than 6. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe the initial step is adding k nodes, making 1 +k. Then, each of these k nodes adds m nodes, but m could be any k>1, but perhaps in the hard version, m is fixed as the same k?\n\nWait the problem statement says 'each vertex that is connected by edges to only one other vertex' (i.e., leaves) must be connected to k new vertices. So the same k is used for all expansions.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n- Start with 1 node.\n\n- Step 1: add k nodes connected to the root. Now total nodes: 1 +k.\n\n- Step 2: each of the k nodes adds k children. Now, each",

The snowflake graph is constructed in a specific hierarchical manner, and we need to check if \\( n \\) can be the total number of vertices in such a graph.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph starts with one vertex. It then expands by adding \\( k \\) new vertices connected to the initial vertex. Each subsequent expansion adds \\( k \\) new vertices to each leaf node, and this expansion must be done at least once.\n2. **Mathematical Model**: The total number of vertices \\( n \\) in the snowflake graph can be expressed as \\( 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... + k^m \\), where \\( m \\geq 2 \\). This is because after the initial expansion, each leaf node must add \\( k \\) new vertices, and this process continues for at least two steps.\n3. **Check for Valid \\( n \\)**: For a given \\( n \\), we need to determine if there exists an integer \\( k > 1 \\) such that \\( n \\) can be represented as \\( 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m \\) for some \\( m \\geq 2 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n < 3:\n        return False\n    # We need to find if n can be written as 1 + k*(1 + k + ... +k^m)\n    # where m >=1 (since the expansion step is done at least once)\n    # So n = 1 + k * (sum_{i=0}^{m} k^i) ) \n    # sum_{i=0}^{m} k^i = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1)\n    # So n = 1 + k * (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1)\n    # Rearranged: n-1 = k * (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1)\n    # Let's try possible values of m starting from 1 upwards until k^(m+1) doesn't exceed sqrt(n)\n    max_k = int((n-1)**0.5) + 2\n    for m in range(1, 60):  # m is up to 60 since 2^60 is way larger than 1e18\n        current_sum = (pow(k, m+1) - 1) // (k-1)\n        if (n-1) % k != 0:\n            continue\n        quotient = (n-1) // k\n        if quotient == current_sum:\n            return True\n        # Also check if quotient is one more than current_sum (since it could have multiple steps)\n        if quotient == current_sum + 1:\n            # Check if the next level is possible\n            # Then, the next level would have added another layer\n            # But since m is the maximum, perhaps not needed here\n            pass\n    return False\n\nt = int(sys.stdin.readline())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    if n == 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    # Try all possible k from 2 up to sqrt(n-1)\n    found = False\n    max_k = int((n-1)**0.5) + 2\n    for k in range(2, max_k + 1):\n        # We need to see if n-1 is divisible by k, and the quotient is a sum of a geometric series\n        if (n - 1) % k != 0:\n            continue\n        quotient = (n - 1) // k\n        # Now, check if quotient is a sum of 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m\n        # So, check if (quotient) * (k-1) + 1 is a power of k\n        temp = quotient * (k - 1) + 1\n        if temp <= 1:\n            continue\n        # Find if temp is a power of k\n        power = 1\n        while power * k <= temp:\n            if power * k == temp:\n                found = True\n                break\n            power *= k\n        if found:\n            break\n    print(\"YES\" if found else \"NO\")\n\n# Note: The above code may not handle all cases correctly for very large exponents, but for the problem constraints, it's efficient enough.\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution involves checking each test case to determine if \\( n \\) can be represented as a sum of a geometric series starting from 1 and expanding at least twice. The code iterates through possible values of \\( k \\) and checks if the resulting structure fits the snowflake graph definition.
