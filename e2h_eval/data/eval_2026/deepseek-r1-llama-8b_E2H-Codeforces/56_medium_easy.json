Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about assigning Rebel spaceships to guard B bases. Each base must have exactly one spaceship, and each spaceship must have exactly one base. So essentially, we're looking for a perfect matching between the two sets.\n\nBut there's an additional constraint: any two paths from a base to its assigned spaceship shouldn't intersect in 2D space. Wait, what does that mean? Oh right, because if two paths cross each other, the ships might collide. So the paths must not intersect except at their endpoints.\n\nHmm, so the assignment of ships to bases must form non-crossing paths.\n\nHow do I model this?\n\nI think this is similar to finding a non-crossing bipartite matching. So each ship is connected to some base, and the edges (connections) shouldn't cross each other.\n\nSo, how can I model this? Maybe using graph theory. The idea is to find a bipartite matching where the edges don't cross.\n\nWait, but how to represent this in code? Since R and B are up to 10, maybe it's manageable with backtracking or permutation methods.\n\nLet me think about the approach:\n\n1. First, check if the number of ships R equals the number of bases B. Because a perfect matching requires equal numbers. If R != B, then output No.\n\nWait, no, wait. The input has R ships and B bases. So for a perfect matching, R must equal B. Otherwise, it's impossible. So first step: if R != B, output No.\n\nLooking back at the sample input:\n\nIn the first example, R=3, B=3. So yes. Second example, R=2, B=2, but the output is No because no perfect matching exists without crossing.\n\nWait, but the second sample's output is No because even though R = B, the paths cross. So the first condition is that R == B, else No.\n\nSo first, check if R != B. If so, output No.\n\nIf R == B, proceed.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding a bijection between ships and bases such that the corresponding segments (ship to base) do not cross each other.\n\nHow to model this.\n\nIdea: For each possible permutation of the ships to bases, check if any two segments cross.\n\nBut since R can be up to 10, the number of permutations is 10! which is 3.6 million. Hmm, that's manageable, as 3 million is not too bad for Python.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For all possible bijections (permutations) of ships to bases:\n   - Check if the set of segments formed by the permutation doesn't have any crossing.\n   - If any permutation satisfies this, output Yes.\n- If none do, output No.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read input: R and B, then R ship coordinates, then B base coordinates.\n\n2. Check if R != B. If not, output No.\n\n3. Else, generate all possible permutations of B bases, assigning each ship to a base in order.\n\n4. For each permutation:\n   a. Create a list of segments, each connecting a ship to its assigned base.\n   b. Check if any two segments in this list cross each other.\n   c. If no crossings, return Yes.\n\n5. If after checking all permutations none satisfy, return No.\n\nNow, the key is how to check if two segments cross.\n\nTo check if two line segments (s1, e1) and (s2, e2) cross, we can use the standard computational geometry method.\n\nHow to do that:\n\nTwo line segments AB and CD intersect if:\n\n- The points A and B are on opposite sides of CD.\n- The points C and D are on opposite sides of AB.\n- And the segments are not collinear and don't overlap.\n\nWait, but in our case, the segments are between a ship and a base. Also, the problem states that no three points are colinear. So any two segments can't be overlapping in a way that they lie on the same line.\n\nSo for each pair of segments, we can check if they cross.\n\nImplementing the line segment intersection check.\n\nFunction to check if two segments AB and CD intersect:\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0] - A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(s1, s2):\n    A, B = s1\n    C, D = s2\n\n    # Compute orientation of points\n    ccw1 = ccw(A, B, C)\n    ccw2 = ccw(A, B, D)\n    ccw3 = ccw(C, D, A)\n    ccw4 = ccw(C, D, B)\n\n    # General case: segments intersect in interior\n    if ((ccw1 > 0 and ccw2 < 0) or (ccw1 < 0 and ccw2 > 0)) and \\\n       ((ccw3 > 0 and ccw4 < 0) or (ccw3 < 0 and ccw4 > 0)):\n        return True\n\n    # Special cases: colinear points\n    # But the problem says no three points are colinear, so this can't happen.\n    # So we don't need to handle that.\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but the problem states that no three points are on the same line. So, no three points are colinear, so any two segments will either cross at a point or not, but not overlap on a line.\n\nSo the function above should correctly determine if two segments cross.\n\nSo in the code, for each permutation, create a list of segments (ship_i -> base_i), and for each pair of segments, check if they cross.\n\nIf any permutation has all segments non-crossing, output Yes. Else, No.\n\nSo now, let's outline the code structure.\n\nRead R and B.\n\nThen read R ship coordinates into a list.\n\nThen read B base coordinates into another list.\n\nIf R != B: print 'No' and exit.\n\nElse, generate all possible permutations of the base list.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   segments = list(zip(ship_list, permuted_base_list))\n\n   check all pairs of segments for intersection.\n\n   if any pair intersects, break and try next permutation.\n\n   else, if no intersections, return Yes.\n\nIf after all permutations, no valid one found, output No.\n\nSo, in Python, this would involve using itertools.permutations.\n\nWait, but the order of the permutation is important. Because each element in the permutation represents the mapping from the i-th ship to the j-th base.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for each permutation in permutations(base_coords):\n\n   create a list of tuples (ship_i, base_j).\n\n   Then, for all pairs of segments (i, j) and (k, l), check if the segments cross.\n\n   So for each pair of segments (s1, s2) in the current permutation:\n\n      check if they cross.\n\n      if any pair crosses, break and proceed to next permutation.\n\nIf all pairs are checked and no crossings, then return Yes.\n\nNow, the question is, how efficient is this approach.\n\nGiven R and B up to 10, the number of permutations is 10! = 3,628,800. For each permutation, we have R segments. The number of pairs of segments is R*(R-1)/2, which for R=10 is 45. So total operations per permutation are 45 * 10 = 450 (since for each pair, we have to check if they cross). Wait, no: for each permutation, the number of pairs is R choose 2, which is 10*9/2 =45 for R=10. So for each permutation, 45 pairs to check.\n\nSo total operations are 3.6e6 * 45 = 162,000,000 operations. Hmm, that's a lot for Python. It might be acceptable, but perhaps we can optimize.\n\nWait, but R can be up to 10. 10! is about 3.6 million, each requiring 45 checks. So 3.6e6 * 45 = 162 million operations. In Python, each operation is relatively slow, but 162 million could take a while. But considering that R is up to 10, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a smarter way.\n\nAlternative approach: model this as a bipartite graph and find a maximum matching that also ensures that no edges cross. But how?\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is small, perhaps we can precompute all possible matchings and check for each.\n\nWait, but the approach I have is manageable for R up to 10.\n\nAnother idea: memoize the permutations to avoid redundant work. Or perhaps find a way to prune the search early.\n\nBut for now, let's proceed with the initial approach, as it's straightforward.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nImport necessary modules:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nRead input:\n\nr_b = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nr, b = map(int, r_b.split())\nships = []\nfor _ in range(r):\n    x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    ships.append( (x, y) )\nbases = []\nfor _ in range(b):\n    x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    bases.append( (x, y) )\n\nCheck if r != b:\n\nif r != b:\n    print(\"No\")\n    exit()\n\nThen, for each permutation in permutations(bases):\n\nfor perm in permutations(bases):\n    # create the segments\n    segments = list(zip(ships, perm))\n    # check all pairs\n    ok = True\n    for i in range(len(segments)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(segments)):\n            s1 = segments[i]\n            s2 = segments[j]\n            # check if s1 and s2 cross\n            if segments_intersect(s1, s2):\n                ok = False\n                break\n        if not ok:\n            break\n    if ok:\n        print(\"Yes\")\n        exit()\n\nAfter checking all permutations, print \"No\".\n\nNow, implement the segments_intersect function.\n\nImplementing the CCW function.\n\nWait, but how to represent the points? Each point is a tuple of two integers.\n\nSo, the function:\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    # compute (B.x - A.x)*(C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(C.x - A.x)\n    return (B[0] - A[0]) * (C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1]) * (C[0] - A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(s1, s2):\n    A, B = s1\n    C, D = s2\n\n    ccw1 = ccw(A, B, C)\n    ccw2 = ccw(A, B, D)\n    ccw3 = ccw(C, D, A)\n    ccw4 = ccw(C, D, B)\n\n    # General case: lines cross in the interior\n    general_case = (\n        (ccw1 > 0 and ccw2 < 0) or \n        (ccw1 < 0 and ccw2 > 0) \n    ) and (\n        (ccw3 > 0 and ccw4 < 0) or \n        (ccw3 < 0 and ccw4 > 0) \n    )\n    return general_case\n\nWait, but sometimes the segments might touch at an endpoint, but according to the problem statement, no three points are colinear, so the segments can't share a common point unless they meet at the endpoints, which is allowed.\n\nWait, no: the problem says that the paths are straight lines, and the constraint is that any two paths do not intersect. So if two segments share a common point (like a base is connected to two ships), that's a problem. But wait, in the matching, each base is assigned to exactly one ship. So no two segments share a base or a ship. So that's handled by the fact that it's a perfect matching. So in the permutation, each base is used once.\n\nSo, for the segments, each is a unique pair, so no two segments share a base or a ship. So the only possibility of intersection is crossing.\n\nSo, the function correctly returns True only when two segments cross each other.\n\nThus, the code should correctly handle all cases.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nBases:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nWait, no, the sample input seems to be given as two separate inputs, but perhaps in the actual code, it's read as the first part.\n\nWait, the sample input is written as:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWhich seems like two test cases. But in the problem statement, it says that the input is for a single test case. So perhaps the way the input is presented is a bit unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input formatting. Because the actual input is a single test case, not multiple.\n\nBut regardless, the code should process each test case correctly.\n\nIn any case, for the first sample, the output is Yes because a permutation exists where the segments don't cross.\n\nFor the second sample, R=2, B=2, but the two possible matchings are:\n\nShip 1 → Base 1\n\nShip 2 → Base 2\n\nand\n\nShip 1 → Base 2\n\nShip 2 → Base 1\n\nWe need to check both.\n\nFor the first case, the segments are from ship 1 to base 1, and ship 2 to base 2. Do these segments cross?\n\nShip 1 is at (0,0), base 1 is at (1,0). Ship 2 is at (2,0), base 2 is at (2,2). The segments are (0,0)-(1,0) and (2,0)-(2,2). These do not cross.\n\nWait, wait, no: because the segments are (0,0) to (1,0) and (2,0) to (2,2). They are adjacent but do not cross.\n\nWait, but wait: in the second permutation, ship 1 is matched to base 2 (which is at (2,2)), and ship 2 is matched to base 1 (at (1,0)). The segments are (0,0)-(2,2) and (2,0)-(1,0). Do these cross?\n\nYes, because the first segment goes from (0,0) to (2,2), and the second goes from (2,0) to (1,0). These two segments cross at (1,1) or something?\n\nWait, let's compute.\n\nSegment 1: (0,0) to (2,2). Equation: y = x.\n\nSegment 2: (2,0) to (1,0). This is a horizontal line at y=0, from x=2 to x=1.\n\nThese two lines cross at (2,0) ? Wait, no. Wait, the segment from (2,0) to (1,0) is along y=0. The segment from (0,0) to (2,2) is a diagonal line that passes through (2,2). So, do they cross?\n\nYes, because the diagonal crosses the horizontal line at (2,0). But that's the endpoint of the second segment. So in terms of the segments, they meet at (2,0), but that's an endpoint. So in our code, we don't consider this as an intersection because the function only returns True when two segments cross in the interior.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the paths should not intersect. So if two segments meet at a point, does that count as an intersection?\n\nWait, the problem says that any two paths (segments) from a base to its assigned ship must not intersect. So if two segments share a common point (like an endpoint), that's considered an intersection.\n\nWait, but in the perfect matching, each base is assigned to exactly one ship, and each ship to exactly one base. So two segments cannot share a common base or a common ship. So two segments can only share a common point if one is a ship and the other is a base, but that's impossible because each is a pair of ship and base.\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose a ship is connected to a base, and another ship is connected to the same base. But that's not possible because it's a perfect matching. So each segment is from a unique ship to a unique base. So, no two segments share a ship or a base. Thus, two segments can only cross if they are in the middle.\n\nSo, the code's current approach is correct, as it only detects interior crossings.\n\nBut in the second sample input:\n\nShips:\n\nShip 1: (2,1)\n\nShip 2: (2,2)\n\nBases:\n\nBase 1: (3,1)\n\nBase 2: (2,2)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the sample wrong.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 3\n\n... \n\nBases:\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the sample.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second test case in the sample input is:\n\nR=2, B=2.\n\nShips:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\nBases:\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nSo, the possible matchings are:\n\nShip 1 → base 2 (2,2), Ship 2 → base 3 (3,1). The segments are (2,1)-(2,2) and (1,0)-(3,1). Do these cross?\n\nThe first segment is vertical line at x=2 from y=1 to 2.\n\nThe second segment is from (1,0) to (3,1): it's a diagonal line with slope 1.\n\nThey cross at (2,1). That's the endpoint of the first segment and the midpoint of the second. So the segments meet at that point.\n\nSo in the code, the function would return False, because the intersection is at the endpoint, not in the interior.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the paths should not intersect. So if two segments meet at a point, that's considered an intersection, leading to the answer being No.\n\nBut according to the function, it doesn't count that as an intersection.\n\nWait, the function as written only considers cases where the segments cross in the interior. So, in the scenario where two segments meet at a point, the function returns False.\n\nSo, in the second sample, the code would output No because all possible matchings have either a crossing or a meeting at a point.\n\nWait, but in that case, the sample output is No, which matches.\n\nSo the code correctly handles that.\n\nNow, testing the code.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2.\n\nShip positions:\n\n(0,0), (2,2)\n\nBase positions:\n\n(1,1), (3,3)\n\nWait, no, because no three points are colinear. But in this case, the segments would cross if the permutation is (0,0) → (3,3) and (2,2) → (1,1). The segments are from (0,0) to (3,3) and (2,2) to (1,1). These cross.\n\nAlternatively, if the permutation is (0,0)→(1,1) and (2,2)→(3,3). The segments are (0,0)-(1,1) and (2,2)-(3,3), which are parallel and do not cross. So in this case, the code should output Yes.\n\nSo the code would find this permutation and output Yes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nPotential optimizations: since the order of the ships and bases can affect the permutation processing, perhaps sorting the ships or bases in some way can reduce the number of permutations checked. But for R=10, it's unlikely to make a significant difference.\n\nAnother optimization: for a permutation, as soon as any pair of segments is found to cross, we can stop checking further pairs for that permutation. Which is what the code does.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nWait, but in the code, the function 'segments_intersect' is defined outside the loop, but perhaps it's better to make it a helper function inside the code.\n\nAlso, note that the 'base_coords' are passed as a list of tuples.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nWait, in the code, the 'perm' is a permutation of the 'bases' list. So for each permutation, it's a tuple of the B bases in some order.\n\nSo, for each permutation, the segments are created by zipping the 'ships' list with the permutation.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nFinally, the code should read all the input correctly.\n\nSo, writing the code:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nRead R ship coordinates.\n\nRead B base coordinates.\n\nIf R != B: output No.\n\nElse, for each permutation in permutations(bases):\n\n   create segments.\n\n   for each pair of segments:\n\n      if any pair crosses, break and try next permutation.\n\n   if all pairs are okay: output Yes.\n\nIf no permutation works: output No.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the helper functions.\n\nWait, but in the code, the function 'segments_intersect' is called inside the loop.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nThe full code:\n\nRead input.\n\nHandle R != B.\n\nElse, for each permutation in permutations(bases):\n\n   create segments.\n\n   check all pairs.\n\n   if any pair crosses: continue.\n\n   else: output Yes.\n\nElse: output No.\n\nSo, here's the Python code.\n",
