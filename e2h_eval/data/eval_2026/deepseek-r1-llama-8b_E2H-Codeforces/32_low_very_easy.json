    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. First, I need to understand what happens when we remove each element. For each element, I can compute what the new max and min would be in the remaining array, then calculate the instability and find the minimum among all these possibilities.\n\nBut wait, considering that n can be up to 1e5, iterating through each element and for each, checking the max and min of the remaining elements would be too slow. Because for each element, finding the max and min could take O(n) time, leading to O(n^2), which won't work for 1e5 elements.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way. Let's see. Maybe precompute some structures.\n\nWhat if I sort the array first? Sorting will help because the min and max of the sorted array are at the ends. Then, when I remove an element, I can quickly find the next min and max.\n\nWait, but the original array might not be sorted. So perhaps I should first sort it, and then figure out how removing each element affects the min and max.\n\nWait, but the original array isn't necessarily sorted. So the min and max could be any elements. So sorting might complicate things because when you remove an element, the new min or max could come from elsewhere.\n\nHmm, maybe I can precompute the original min and max, and then for each element, see if it's the current min or max, and then compute the new min and max accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal instability is achieved by either removing the current maximum or the current minimum. Because those are the ones contributing most to the instability.\n\nWait, let's think about the initial instability. It's max(a) - min(a). When we remove an element, the new instability could be less than this.\n\nIf the element removed is either the current max or the current min, then the new max or min might be the second max or second min.\n\nFor example, if I remove the max, the new max becomes the second max. Similarly, if I remove the min, the new min becomes the second min. In both cases, the new instability is (second max - min) or (max - second min).\n\nAlternatively, if I remove a middle element, then the max and min remain the same as the original, so the instability remains the same as before.\n\nWait, no. If the array has multiple elements with the same min or max, then even if I remove one, the min or max doesn't change. So for example, if the array has [1, 1, 3, 7], the min is 1, and there are two 1s. Removing one 1 would leave another 1 as min, so the new instability would still be 7-1=6.\n\nSo the approach should be: find the original max and min, then for each element, determine whether removing it would cause the max to decrease, the min to increase, or neither.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Find the original max and min of the array.\n2. For each element in the array:\n   a. If the element is the current max, then the new max is the second max. The new min remains the same unless all elements except this one were the max.\n   b. Similarly, if the element is the current min, the new min is the second min.\n   c. Else, the max and min remain unchanged.\n3. Compute the instability for each case and choose the minimum.\n\nBut how do I efficiently find the second max and second min?\n\nWell, perhaps I can track the counts of the max and min. For example, if the max occurs more than once, then removing one doesn't change the max. Same for the min.\n\nAlternatively, I can find the frequency of the max and min in the array.\n\nSo let's outline the steps more clearly.\n\nStep 1: Compute the global max (gmax) and global min (gmin).\n\nStep 2: Compute the count of gmax (count_gmax) and the count of gmin (count_gmin).\n\nStep 3: For each element in the array:\n\n- If the element is gmax:\n   - If count_gmax > 1, then the new max is still gmax. The new instability is gmax - gmin (since the min hasn't changed).\n   - Else, the new max is the second_max. We need to find the second_max, which is the max of all elements except gmax.\n   - So the new instability would be (second_max - gmin).\n- Similarly, if the element is gmin:\n   - If count_gmin > 1, new min is still gmin. Instability remains gmax - gmin.\n  ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Global Max and Min**: First, we find the global maximum (gmax) and global minimum (gmin) of the array.\n2. **Count Occurrences**: Calculate how many times the global max and min appear in the array.\n3. **Compute Second Max and Min**: To efficiently compute the second maximum and minimum values, we can iterate through the array while keeping track of these values.\n4. **Evaluate Each Element**: For each element in the array, determine if removing it affects the global max or min. If it does, compute the new instability using the second max or min as applicable. If it doesn't, the instability remains the same as the original array.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum possible instability without repeatedly scanning the entire array for each removal, thus optimizing the solution to handle large inputs effectively.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = list(map(int, input[1:n+1]))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    gmax = max(a)\n    gmin = min(a)\n    \n    # Compute count of gmax and gmin\n    count_gmax = a.count(gmax)\n    count_gmin = a.count(gmin)\n    \n    # Compute second_max and second_min\n    second_max = -float('inf')\n    second_min = float('inf')\n    for num in a:\n        if num != gmax:\n            if num > second_max:\n                second_max = num\n        if num != gmin:\n            if num < second_min:\n                second_min = num\n    \n    min_instability = float('inf')\n    \n    for num in a:\n        if num == gmax:\n            if count_gmax > 1:\n                current_instability = gmax - gmin\n            else:\n                current_instability = second_max - gmin\n        elif num == gmin:\n            if count_gmin > 1:\n                current_instability = gmax - gmin\n            else:\n                current_instability = gmax - second_min\n        else:\n            current_instability = gmax - gmin\n        \n        if current_instability < min_instability:\n            min_instability = current_instability\n    \n    print(min_instability)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into an integer `n` and an array `a`.\n2. **Global Max and Min**: The maximum (`gmax`) and minimum (`gmin`) values of the array are determined.\n3. **Count Occurrences**: The number of times `gmax` and `gmin` appear in the array is counted.\n4. **Second Max and Min**: These are computed by iterating through the array and ignoring the global max and min.\n5. **Evaluate Each Element**: For each element, check if removing it affects the global max or min. Compute the instability for each scenario and track the minimum instability encountered.\n6. **Output Result**: The minimum instability is printed as the result.\n\nThis method efficiently handles the problem constraints and ensures optimal performance even for large arrays.",
