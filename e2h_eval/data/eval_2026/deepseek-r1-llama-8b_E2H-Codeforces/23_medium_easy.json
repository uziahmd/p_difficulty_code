In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles, and I have to find the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form at least one mentsu. A mentsu can be a triplet (three same tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\nHmm, let's break it down. First, I need to process each of the three input strings. Each string represents a tile, like '1s' means 1 of suit s.\n\nSo for each of the three cases, I need to determine the minimal number of tiles to add to form a mentsu.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the output is three numbers, each corresponding to the three initial tiles. So for each tile, we need to compute how many more tiles are needed if she were to form a mentsu starting with that tile. Or wait, maybe not exactly. Because she can choose any combination of tiles to form a mentsu, regardless of which initial tile is part of it. So perhaps, for each possible way to form a mentsu using the existing tiles plus some additions, calculate the minimal required.\n\nBut since the output requires three numbers, perhaps each number corresponds to each initial tile. Like, for the first tile, what's the minimal number of tiles to add to form a mentsu that includes that tile. Or perhaps it's considering all possibilities, but the output is just a single value, but the example shows three outputs. Oh wait, looking back:\n\nThe sample input is three strings, and the output is three integers: ['0', '0', '1'].\n\nSo, I think the problem is that for each of the three initial tiles, we need to compute the minimal number of additional tiles needed to form a mentsu that includes that tile. Or maybe, the output is three separate values, each indicating the minimal tiles needed for each initial tile to be part of a mentsu. Hmm, but the sample explanation says that for the third input, she can get a shuntsu by drawing one tile. So the output is three numbers, each representing the minimal for each initial tile.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the output. Let me read the note again.\n\nNo, the output is three integers, each being the minimal number of extra tiles needed for each of the three initial hands. So for each of the three initial sets of three tiles, calculate the minimal number of tiles to add so that that set plus the added tiles contains at least one mentsu.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each of the three initial hands, compute the minimal number of tiles to add to form a mentsu in that hand.\n\nWait, but the three initial hands are given as three separate strings. So each initial hand is treated separately.\n\nWait no, perhaps the problem is that Tokitsukaze has three tiles in total, but the input is given as three separate lines? Or is it that the input is three tiles, possibly from different suits and numbers, and we need to process them all together?\n\nWait, the input is a single line containing three strings. Each string is a tile. So the initial hand consists of three tiles. For example, in the sample input, the three tiles are 1s, 2s, 3s. So she already has a shuntsu, hence needs 0 more.\n\nWait, but then the second example has three 9m tiles. She has a koutsu, so 0.\n\nThird example: 3p, 9m, 2p. She can add 1p or 4p to form a shuntsu.\n\nSo the output is three numbers, each corresponding to each tile in the initial set, indicating the minimal number of tiles to add so that that tile is part of a mentsu.\n\nOr perhaps, for each initial tile, consider all possible ways to form a mentsu that includes that tile, and find the minimal number of tiles needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each initial hand (each of the three), compute the minimal number of tiles to add to create at least one mentsu in that hand. But the sample output has three numbers, each for each of the initial three.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the three tiles are 1s, 2s, 3s (so a shuntsu, thus output 0 for all?), but the sample output is 0, 0, 1. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nWait, maybe the input is a list of three hands, each consisting of three tiles. So for each of the three hands, compute the minimal number of tiles to add to form a mentsu in that hand.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the sample output has three numbers.\n\nIn the first case, the hand is 1s, 2s, 3s — which forms a shuntsu, so 0 tiles needed.\n\nSecond case: 9m, 9m, 9m — a koutsu, so 0.\n\nThird case: 3p, 9m, 2p. She can add 1p or 4p. So adding one tile, so 1.\n\nHence the output is 0,0,1.\n\nSo the approach is, for each of the three given hands, compute the minimal number of tiles to add to make that hand contain at least one mentsu.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each of the three hands:\n\n- Determine the minimal number of tiles to add to the hand to form at least one mentsu.\n\nThen output these three numbers.\n\nNow, how to compute this for a given hand.\n\nSo, for a given hand of three tiles, what is the minimal number of tiles to add to form a mentsu.\n\nA mentsu can be a triplet (all same) or a sequence (consecutive in same suit).\n\nSo for a given hand, we can check whether any triplet or sequence exists, and if so, the minimal is 0. Otherwise, find the minimal number.\n\nBut wait, even if the current hand doesn't form a mentsu, adding some tiles might create it.\n\nSo, the steps for a single hand:\n\n1. Enumerate all possible triplets and sequences that can be formed using the existing tiles plus some new ones.\n\n2. For each possible mentsu (triplet or sequence), compute how many new tiles are needed.\n\n3. Find the minimal number of tiles needed across all possible mentsu options.\n\nSo, for a given hand, generate all possible mentsu candidates and compute the minimal required.\n\nSo, let's think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, for each hand, we can represent the tiles as a dictionary, counting the number of each tile.\n\nWait, but for each hand, since it's only three tiles, perhaps it's better to represent them as a multiset.\n\nBut for the purposes of checking, perhaps it's easier to have a count for each tile.\n\nSo for each hand, create a frequency map.\n\nFor example, in the first sample hand, 1s, 2s, 3s:\n\nEach tile appears once.\n\nFor the second sample, 9m appears three times.\n\nThird sample: 3p, 9m, 2p. So frequencies are 3p:1, 9m:1, 2p:1.\n\nSo, for each hand, the initial state is known.\n\nNow, for each possible mentsu candidate, compute how many tiles are needed.\n\nPossible mentsu types:\n\n- Triplet: three identical tiles.\n\n- Sequence: three consecutive numbers in same suit.\n\nSo, for each possible triplet:\n\nCheck if the hand can form a triplet for any tile, considering that you can add tiles.\n\nSimilarly, for each possible sequence, check if the hand can form a sequence with the addition of some tiles.\n\nWe need to find the minimal number of tiles needed to complete any such mentsu.\n\nSo, for each possible triplet, compute the number of tiles needed.\n\nSame for sequences.\n\nLet's formalize this.\n\nFor a triplet:\n\nSuppose the triplet is (a, a, a). The number of tiles needed is 3 minus the count of a in the hand. But wait, since the hand can have other tiles, but as long as we have enough a's.\n\nWait, no: for example, if the hand has two a's, then we need one more to form a triplet.\n\nIf the hand has zero a's, we need three.\n\nSo for a triplet, the required tiles are max(0, 3 - current_count[a]).\n\nBut we also need to see if there are any a's in the hand. If current_count[a] is zero, then to form a triplet, we need to add three a's.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the hand may have other tiles, but for a triplet, we only need three same tiles. So for each possible a (from 1-9, m, p, s), compute the required tiles for triplet a.\n\nSimilarly, for a sequence, it's a bit more complex.\n\nFor a sequence, say 1m, 2m, 3m: it's a valid shuntsu. So, the hand must have all three numbers in the sequence, possibly missing some, which can be added.\n\nSo for a sequence (x, x+1, x+2) in suit s, the required tiles are the number of missing tiles in the hand. So for each possible sequence in each suit, compute how many tiles are needed.\n\nFor example, hand has 3p, 9m, 2p. To form 2p, 3p, 4p, the hand is missing 4p. So required tiles: 1.\n\nSo, for each possible triplet and each possible sequence, compute the required tiles.\n\nThen, among all these possibilities, the minimal required is the answer.\n\nSo, for a given hand, the steps are:\n\n1. Generate all possible triplet candidates.\n\n   For each possible tile (like 1m, 2m, ...,9m; same for p and s):\n\n      a. Compute how many tiles are needed to form a triplet of this type.\n\n      b. Add to the list of possible required tiles.\n\n2. Generate all possible sequence candidates.\n\n   For each suit s:\n\n      For x in 1..7:\n\n          The sequence is x, x+1, x+2 in suit s.\n\n          Compute how many tiles are needed in the hand for this sequence.\n\n          For each tile in the sequence, check how many are present in the hand.\n\n          The required tiles are 3 minus the sum of (count of each tile in the sequence present in the hand).\n\n          So for x=2, s=m: the sequence is 2m,3m,4m. If the hand has two of 3m, then the required is 3 - (1 for 2m, 2 for 3m, 0 for 4m) = 3 -3 =0? Wait, no. Wait, the sum is 1+2+0=3, so required is 0.\n\n          Wait, no. Wait, the count for each tile in the sequence is how much is in the hand.\n\n          So for each tile in the sequence, if it's present, count the number. Summing these gives the number of tiles in the hand that belong to the sequence.\n\n          The required tiles are 3 minus this sum.\n\n          So for the sequence, required is max(0, 3 - (sum of counts)).\n\n   For each such sequence, add the required tiles to the list.\n\n3. After generating all possible triplet and sequence candidates, find the minimal required tiles.\n\nBut wait, what about overlapping? Like, a triplet could also be a sequence if, say, the triplet is 5m,5m,5m. No, because a sequence requires three distinct numbers, consecutive. So triplet and sequence are mutually exclusive.\n\nSo for each hand, the possible candidates are all the triplets (for all possible a) and all the sequences (for all possible suits and x).\n\nOnce we have all the required tiles for all possible mentsu, the minimal required is the smallest number in that list.\n\nBut wait, what if the hand is empty? No, the hand always has three tiles, but after adding, it can have more.\n\nWait, no. The initial hand is three tiles, but when adding, the hand grows. So for each possible mentsu, the required is the number of tiles to add beyond the current hand.\n\nWait, but for a triplet, the required is 3 minus the current count of that tile in the hand.\n\nYes. Because if the hand has two a's, you need one more. If it has zero, you need three.\n\nSimilarly, for a sequence, the required is the number of tiles missing in the sequence.\n\nSo, for each possible triplet and sequence, compute the required, and take the minimal.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the hand can form a mentsu in multiple ways. For example, if the hand is 1m, 2m, 2m, then it's possible to form a sequence 1m,2m,3m, requiring 1 tile, or a triplet for 2m, requiring 1 tile.\n\nSo, the minimal is 1.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each hand:\n\n   Compute all possible triplet-based required tiles.\n\n   Compute all possible sequence-based required tiles.\n\n   Take the minimal value from all these.\n\nSo, for each hand, the minimal required is the smallest of all these required values.\n\nBut wait, perhaps in some cases, adding tiles can form multiple mentsus. But we only need at least one.\n\nSo, the minimal is the minimal required across all possible mentsus.\n\nSo, now, the plan is:\n\nFor each of the three initial hands:\n\n   Create a frequency map of the tiles.\n\n   For all possible triplet types (all possible a), compute the required.\n\n   For all possible sequence types (all possible suits and x), compute the required.\n\n   Find the minimal required.\n\n   Output that number.\n\nBut wait, the initial hand is three tiles, but in the code, each of the three initial hands is processed as a separate case.\n\nSo, the code will process each of the three initial hands, compute their minimal required, and output three numbers.\n\nSo, the next step is to implement this logic.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nEach tile can be represented as a string, like '1m'.\n\nThe frequency map can be a dictionary where keys are the tile strings, and values are the counts.\n\nSo, for a given hand, we can parse each tile into the string, and build the frequency map.\n\nFor example, the hand ['3p', '9m', '2p'] becomes {'3p':1, '9m':1, '2p':1}.\n\nNow, for the triplet case:\n\nFor each possible a (1-9, m, p, s), the triplet is a, a, a.\n\nThe required is 3 - count[a], if a exists in the frequency map. Otherwise, it's 3.\n\nBut wait, no: for a triplet, the required is the number of a's needed. For example, if the hand has two a's, required is 1. If none, required is 3.\n\nSo for each a, required = max(0, 3 - count.get(a, 0)).\n\nWait, but for a triplet, the hand can have other tiles besides a. But for the triplet, you only need three a's. So, regardless of other tiles, the required is based on how many a's are present.\n\nSo, for each a in all possible tiles, compute the required as 3 - count.get(a, 0). If this is <=0, then 0 is needed.\n\nWait, no. Because 3 - count.get(a,0) could be negative. For example, if the hand has four a's. Then 3 -4 = -1. But that's impossible, so in that case, the required is 0.\n\nSo, the required is max(0, 3 - count.get(a, 0)).\n\nSo, for each a, compute this.\n\nSimilarly, for sequences:\n\nFor each suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n   For x in 1..7:\n\n       The sequence is [str(x)+suit, str(x+1)+suit, str(x+2)+suit]\n\n       For each tile in this sequence, check how many are present in the hand.\n\n       Sum the counts for each tile.\n\n       required = 3 - sum_counts.\n\n       required = max(0, required)\n\nSo, for each possible sequence, compute the required.\n\nNow, collect all the required values for all possible triplet and sequence, and find the minimal.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nRead the three input lines.\n\nFor each line:\n\n   Parse into a list of three tiles.\n\n   Build frequency map.\n\n   Compute all possible triplet requireds.\n\n   Compute all possible sequence requireds.\n\n   Find the minimal required.\n\n   Add to the result list.\n\nPrint the result as three integers.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: Hand is already a triplet.\n\nE.g., '9m 9m 9m'\n\nTriplet required is 0.\n\nSequence: for each possible sequence, compute required.\n\nBut the minimal is 0.\n\nSo output 0.\n\nCase 2: Hand is three different tiles in a sequence.\n\nE.g., '1m 2m 3m' → sequence required is 0.\n\nOther sequences may require more.\n\nSo output 0.\n\nCase 3: Hand has two tiles of a kind and one other.\n\nE.g., '1m 1m 2m'\n\nTriplet for 1m requires 1.\n\nSequence for 1m,2m,3m: hand has 1m, 2m → count 2, so required is 3-2=1.\n\nSo minimal is 1.\n\nAnother example: '3p,9m,2p' → can form 2p,3p,4p by adding 4p. Required 1.\n\nAlso, for triplet 3p: need 2 more.\n\nSo minimal is 1.\n\nAnother test case: '1m 1m 2m 3m' → but wait, no, each initial hand is three tiles.\n\nWait, no: each initial hand is three tiles.\n\nWait, another test case: '1m 3m 5m' → to form a sequence, the hand is missing 2m and 4m, 6m etc. So for the sequence 1m,2m,3m: required 2 (since 1 and 3 are present). Or for 3m,4m,5m: required 2 (3 and 5 are present).\n\nBut perhaps a triplet is better. For example, any tile can form a triplet, but each requires 3 minus current count.\n\nSo for '1m 3m 5m':\n\nTriplet for 1m: 3-1=2.\n\nTriplet for 3m: 3-1=2.\n\nTriplet for 5m: 3-1=2.\n\nSo the minimal required is 2, unless a sequence can be formed with fewer.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLooking for sequences in any suit.\n\nFor m:\n\nCheck x=1: 1m,2m,3m → hand has 1 and 3 → sum is 2 → required 1.\n\nx=2: 2m,3m,4m → hand has 3 → sum 1 → required 2.\n\nx=3: 3m,4m,5m → hand has 3 and5 → sum 2 → required 1.\n\nSo the minimal is 1.\n\nSo for this hand, the minimal required is 1.\n\nSo the code should correctly find that.\n\nSo, in code, for each hand, we'll generate all possible triplet and sequence candidates, compute required for each, and find the minimal.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nParsing the input:\n\nThe input is a single line with three strings, separated by spaces.\n\nSo in Python:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\nEach element is a string, e.g., '1s'.\n\nThen, for each of the three tiles:\n\nProcess each as a separate hand.\n\nSo, for i in range(3):\n\n   hand = tiles[i]\n\n   process_hand(hand)\n\nCompute the minimal required for each hand.\n\nSo, for each hand:\n\nParse into three tiles.\n\nBuild a frequency map.\n\nCompute all possible triplet requireds.\n\nCompute all possible sequence requireds.\n\nFind the minimal required.\n\nNow, the triplet loop:\n\nFor each possible tile (all 27 possibilities):\n\nCompute required = max(0, 3 - count.get(a, 0)).\n\nAdd to the list of candidates.\n\nThe sequence loop:\n\nFor each suit in ['m','p','s']:\n\n   for x in 1 to 7:\n\n       seq = [str(x) + suit, str(x+1) + suit, str(x+2) + suit]\n\n       sum_count = 0\n\n       for t in seq:\n\n           sum_count += count.get(t, 0)\n\n       required = max(0, 3 - sum_count)\n\n       add to candidates.\n\nSo, for each hand, the code will generate 9*3 + 3*7 = 27 +21=48 candidates, which is manageable.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nBut wait, in code:\n\nEach hand is a list of three tiles.\n\nSo, for each hand, create a frequency map.\n\nIn Python:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef compute_min(required_triplets, required_sequences):\n    min_required = min(required_triplets + required_sequences)\n    return min_required\n\nhand = ['tile1', 'tile2', 'tile3']\nfreq = defaultdict(int)\nfor t in hand:\n    freq[t] +=1\n\nrequired_triplets = []\nfor suit in ['m','p','s']:\n    for num in range(1,10):\n        a = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n        cnt = freq.get(a,0)\n        req = max(0, 3 - cnt)\n        required_triplets.append(req)\n\nrequired_sequences = []\nfor suit in ['m','p','s']:\n    for x in range(1,8):  # x can be 1 to 7 inclusive\n        seq = [f\"{x}{suit}\", f\"{x+1}{suit}\", f\"{x+2}{suit}\"]\n        sum_cnt = 0\n        for t in seq:\n            sum_cnt += freq.get(t, 0)\n        req = max(0, 3 - sum_cnt)\n        required_sequences.append(req)\n\nmin_val = min(required_triplets + required_sequences)\nprint(min_val)\n\nWait, but in the code above, for each triplet, it's considering all 9 numbers in each of the three suits, leading to 27 candidates.\n\nSimilarly, for sequences, 3 suits × 7 possible x → 21 candidates.\n\nSo, for each hand, the code will have 48 candidates, which is manageable.\n\nThus, for each of the three hands, compute this and collect the three results.\n\nSo, in the main function:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\nresult = []\n\nfor i in range(3):\n    hand = tiles[i]\n    # process hand...\n    # compute min_required as above\n    result.append(str(min_required))\n\nprint(' '.join(result))\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nWait, but wait: for the initial hand, which is three tiles, the code is processing each as a separate case. So for each of the three initial tiles, compute the minimal required for that specific hand.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Because the initial hand is three tiles, but when adding tiles, the hand can have any number of tiles (three plus added). So, the code is correct in considering each hand as a separate case.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 3: '3p 9m 2p'\n\nHand is ['3p', '9m', '2p']\n\nfreq: {'3p':1, '9m':1, '2p':1}\n\nCompute required_triplets:\n\nFor each a in 1m, 2m, ...,9m, 1p, 2p, ...,9p, 1s, 2s,...,9s.\n\nFor a=3p: req is 3-1=2.\n\na=9m: req 3-1=2.\n\na=2p: req 3-1=2.\n\nOther a's have 0 count, so req is 3.\n\nSo required_triplets has 27 elements, including 2,2,2, and others 3.\n\nFor sequences:\n\nCheck each suit.\n\nSuit 'p':\n\nx=1: 1p, 2p, 3p.\n\nSum counts: 2p and 3p are present (each count 1). So sum is 2. req is 1.\n\nx=2: 2p,3p,4p → sum is 2 (2p and 3p). req 1.\n\nx=3: 3p,4p,5p → sum is 1 (3p). req 2.\n\nSimilarly for other x.\n\nSo for 'p' suit, the required is 1 for x=1 and 2.\n\nSo required_sequences for this case include 1.\n\nThus, the minimal required is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nAnother test case: hand is ['1m', '1m', '1m'] → triplet req is 0.\n\nAnother test case: ['1m', '2m', '3m'] → sequence req is 0.\n\nAnother test case: ['1m', '2m', '4m'].\n\nFor triplet:\n\nAll a's would require 3 - count, which is 3-1=2, except for 1m, 2m, 4m: each requires 2.\n\nFor sequences:\n\nIn 'm' suit:\n\nx=1: 1,2,3 → present 1,2,0 → sum 2 → req 1.\n\nx=2: 2,3,4 → present 2,0,1 → sum 3 → req 0.\n\nSo, in this case, the minimal required is 0.\n\nWait, for x=2, sequence is 2m,3m,4m. The hand has 2m and 4m. So sum is 2 (counts 1 each). So req is 1. So why do I think it's 0?\n\nWait, no: 2m,3m,4m: the hand has 2m (1) and 4m (1). So sum is 2 → req is 1.\n\nSo, no, the minimal required is 1.\n\nWait, but wait, what's the correct minimal? Because the hand is 1m,2m,4m.\n\nTo form a sequence, adding 3m would complete x=2 sequence (2m,3m,4m). So required is 1.\n\nIs there a way to form a sequence with less than 1 tile? No. So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo, the code correctly finds that.\n\nAnother test case: hand is ['1m', '1m', '2m'].\n\nFor triplet 1m: req is 1.\n\nFor sequence 1m,2m,3m: sum is 1m (2) and 2m (1) → sum 3 → req 0.\n\nSo the minimal is 0.\n\nWait, no. Because the hand has 1m,1m,2m. So for the sequence 1m,2m,3m: the hand has 1m and 2m, but not 3m. So sum is 2 (1m count 2, 2m count 1). So 3-2-1=0? Wait, no: the sum is 2+1=3. So required is 3-3=0.\n\nSo the code would compute that, and the minimal is 0.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for each hand, the code is processing all 27 triplets and 21 sequences, which is acceptable.\n\nBut in the code, the triplet loop is:\n\nfor suit in ['m','p','s']:\n\n   for num in 1 to 9:\n\n       a = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n\nBut this includes all 9 numbers per suit, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for sequences, for each suit, x runs from 1 to 7.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut note that in the input, the three tiles are passed as a single line, split into three parts.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\nresult = []\n\nfor i in range(3):\n\n    current_hand = tiles[i]\n\n    # create frequency map\n\n    freq = {}\n\n    for t in current_hand:\n\n        key = t\n\n        if key in freq:\n\n            freq[key] += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            freq[key] = 1\n\n    # compute triplet requireds\n\n    triplet_req = []\n\n    for s in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n        for num in range(1,10):\n\n            a = f\"{num}{s}\"\n\n            cnt = freq.get(a, 0)\n\n            req = max(0, 3 - cnt)\n\n            triplet_req.append(req)\n\n    # compute sequence requireds\n\n    seq_req = []\n\n    for s in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n        for x in range(1, 8):\n\n            t1 = f\"{x}{s}\"\n\n            t2 = f\"{x+1}{s}\"\n\n            t3 = f\"{x+2}{s}\"\n\n            sum_cnt = freq.get(t1, 0) + freq.get(t2, 0) + freq.get(t3, 0)\n\n            req = max(0, 3 - sum_cnt)\n\n            seq_req.append(req)\n\n    # find the minimal required\n\n    all_req = triplet_req + seq_req\n\n    min_req = min(all_req)\n\n    result.append(str(min_req))\n\nprint(' '.join(result))\n\nWait, but in the code, for each triplet, it's appending the req for each a. So, for example, a=1m, 2m, etc., all 27 are considered.\n\nSimilarly, for each sequence, all 21 are considered.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nProcessing each hand:\n\nFirst hand: 1s,2s,3s.\n\nfreq: {'1s':1, '2s':1, '3s':1}\n\nTriplet req: for 1s: 2, 2s: 2, 3s:2, others 3.\n\nSo triplet_req has 27 elements, all >=0.\n\nBut for sequences, in 's' suit:\n\nx=1: 1s,2s,3s → sum is 3 → req 0.\n\nSo all_req includes 0, so min is 0.\n\nSecond hand: 9m,9m,9m.\n\nfreq: {'9m':3}\n\nTriplet_req for 9m: 0.\n\nOther triplet_req are 3 or higher.\n\nSo min is 0.\n\nThird hand: 3p,9m,2p.\n\nfreq: {'3p':1, '9m':1, '2p':1}.\n\nTriplet_req for 3p:2, 9m:2, 2p:2, others 3.\n\nseq_req for 'p' suit:\n\nx=1: 1p,2p,3p → sum 2 → req 1.\n\nx=2: 2p,3p,4p → sum 2 → req 1.\n\nx=3: 3p,4p,5p → sum 1 → req 2.\n\nSo, in the all_req, there are 1's from these sequences.\n\nThus, the min is 1.\n\nThus, the output is 0 0 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: hand is ['1m', '2m', '4m'].\n\nTriplet_req: for 1m,2m,4m: each has 1, so req 2 each.\n\nOthers are 3.\n\nseq_req:\n\nIn 'm' suit:\n\nx=1: 1,2,3 → sum 2 → req 1.\n\nx=2: 2,3,4 → sum 2 → req 1.\n\nSo min is 1.\n\nThus, the code should return 1.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) from her current hand of three tiles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: A mentsu can be either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit). The goal is to find the minimum number of additional tiles required for each initial set of three tiles to form at least one mentsu.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each initial set of three tiles, we need to check all possible triplets and sequences. For each possible triplet, calculate how many more tiles are needed to complete it. Similarly, for each possible sequence, calculate how many more tiles are needed. The minimum number of tiles required across all these possibilities is the answer for that initial set.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - For each initial set of three tiles, create a frequency map to count occurrences of each tile.\n   - For each possible triplet (all 27 possible tiles), compute the number of tiles needed to complete the triplet.\n   - For each possible sequence (21 possible sequences across three suits), compute the number of tiles needed to complete the sequence.\n   - Determine the minimum number of tiles required from all possible triplets and sequences.\n\n4. **Complexity**: The algorithm efficiently checks all possible triplets and sequences, ensuring that we find the optimal solution without excessive computational overhead.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ntiles = input().split()\n\nresult = []\n\nfor i in range(3):\n    current_hand = tiles[i]\n    \n    # Create frequency map\n    freq = {}\n    for t in current_hand:\n        key = t\n        if key in freq:\n            freq[key] += 1\n        else:\n            freq[key] = 1\n    \n    # Compute required tiles for triplets\n    triplet_req = []\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        for num in range(1, 10):\n            a = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n            cnt = freq.get(a, 0)\n            req = max(0, 3 - cnt)\n            triplet_req.append(req)\n    \n    # Compute required tiles for sequences\n    seq_req = []\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        for x in range(1, 8):  # x ranges from 1 to 7 inclusive\n            t1 = f\"{x}{suit}\"\n            t2 = f\"{x+1}{suit}\"\n            t3 = f\"{x+2}{suit}\"\n            sum_cnt = freq.get(t1, 0) + freq.get(t2, 0) + freq.get(t3, 0)\n            req = max(0, 3 - sum_cnt)\n            seq_req.append(req)\n    \n    # Find the minimal required\n    all_req = triplet_req + seq_req\n    min_req = min(all_req)\n    result.append(str(min_req))\n\nprint(' '.join(result))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Frequency Map**: This map keeps track of how many times each tile appears in the current hand.\n- **Triplet Check**: For each possible tile (e.g., 1m, 2p, ..., 9s), compute how many more tiles are needed to form a triplet.\n- **Sequence Check**: For each possible sequence in each suit, compute how many more tiles are needed to form the sequence.\n- **Result Calculation**: The minimum number of tiles required across all possible triplets and sequences is determined and stored for each initial set of tiles.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal solution by considering all possible ways to form a mentsu, thus guaranteeing the correct minimum number of additional tiles needed.",
