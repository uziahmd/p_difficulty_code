The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Xenia is trying to complete her tasks by moving along a ringroad. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem statement says that Xenia lives in a city with n houses arranged in a ring. The traffic is one-way and clockwise. She starts at house 1 and has m tasks. For each task i, she needs to be at house a_i, and she must do all tasks with numbers less than i in order. Wait, no, wait— the description says she needs to be in the house number ai to complete the i-th task. And also, she has to complete all tasks with numbers less than i. So, does that mean she can't skip any earlier tasks? Or maybe it's that for each task, she must have already done all the previous ones before moving on.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\" Hmm, perhaps that means that for the i-th task, she must have done all j < i first. But I'm not entirely sure. Oh, but looking at the example might help.\n\nIn the first example input, the sequence of moves is 1 → 2 → 3 →4 →1 →2 →3. Let me see: the tasks are 3,2,3. So task 1 is at 3, task 2 at 2, task 3 at 3 again.\n\nWait, but the way she moves is such that she goes through each necessary point, but the optimal path is found by considering the earliest possible time she can reach each required point, especially considering that some tasks may require revisiting previous points.\n\nSo, the key here is to find the minimal path that covers all the required positions, in the order they appear, but possibly visiting some points multiple times if needed.\n\nI think the approach is to model the problem as moving from house to house, ensuring that each required task is visited in order, but possibly making loops if needed.\n\nWait, but how do the tasks affect the movement? Because each task requires being in a certain position, but the order matters because she can't skip earlier tasks. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the sequence of required positions in the order of their occurrence, and for each position, determine the earliest time she can arrive there, considering the movement constraints.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. We have m tasks, each with an a_i. These are given in the order of the tasks. So for task 1, she must be at a_1, then task 2 at a_2, etc.\n\n2. However, the starting point is house 1.\n\n3. The movement is along the ring, which is circular. So the distance between two houses can be calculated as the minimum of the clockwise and counter-clockwise distances. But since the traffic is one-way and clockwise, she can only move in the clockwise direction. Wait, no, wait. The ring is a one-way, and the traffic is clockwise. So she can only move to the next house in the clockwise direction. So, for example, from house 1, she can go to 2, then 3, ..., up to n, and then back to 1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the ring is one way and the traffic is clockwise, meaning that she can only move in the clockwise direction. So moving from a house to the next higher-numbered house is allowed, but moving backward (like from 2 to 1) is not allowed. Is that correct? Because otherwise, the ring would allow both directions, but the problem says it's one way and the direction is clockwise.\n\nSo, movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction. So, from house x, she can go to x+1, x+2, ... mod n.\n\nSo, in terms of movement, the distance from x to y is (y - x) mod n. Because moving clockwise, you can't go the other way. So, for example, moving from 3 to 1 when n=4 is impossible unless you go 3→4→1. So the distance is 2 steps.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the ring is a loop, so the distance from x to y in the clockwise direction is (y -x) mod n, but if that's negative, you add n. For example, from 4 to 1, the clockwise distance is 1 (since after 4 comes 1). From 3 to 1, it's 2 steps (3→4→1).\n\nSo, for any two houses a and b, the clockwise distance is (b -a) % n if b >=a, else (n + (b -a)) %n. Wait, no, because in a ring of size n, the distance from a to b when moving clockwise is (b -a) if b >a, else (n - (a - b)). So, for example, n=4, a=3, b=1: (1-3)= -2, mod 4 is 2, which is the correct distance.\n\nSo the distance is (b - a) % n. Because for a=3, b=1: (1-3) = -2 mod 4 is 2.\n\nWait, yes, because (1-3) is -2, which mod 4 is 2. So, (b -a) mod n gives the correct clockwise distance.\n\nSo, movement can only happen in the clockwise direction, so the path from a to b is fixed as the shortest path in that direction.\n\nSo now, the problem is to find the minimal total time to visit all the required a_i's in the order of the tasks, starting from 1.\n\nWait, but the tasks can be repeated. Like, in the first example, the third task is at 3 again. So she might have to revisit some places.\n\nBut how do we model the minimal path?\n\nIdea: Since the movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction, the minimal path will involve visiting each required point in the earliest possible moment, and possibly making loops when needed.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal path is to visit each a_i in the order of their occurrence, but sometimes needing to loop around the ring multiple times.\n\nWait, another idea: The minimal time is the sum of the distances between consecutive required points, considering the order of the tasks and the starting point.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the required points could be in any order, but the tasks are processed in the order given. So for each task i, she must have already completed all tasks j <i.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to process the tasks in the order of their occurrence, and for each a_i, compute the minimal steps needed to get there from the current position, considering the direction of movement.\n\nWait, but the starting position is 1. Then, for each a_i in the order of the tasks, she must go from the current position to a_i, moving only clockwise. Each step takes 1 unit of time.\n\nBut what about when the same a_i appears multiple times in the list? For example, if the list is [3,2,3], then she goes from 1→2→3→... etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to model the problem as a series of waypoints, where each waypoint is a_i, and the order of the waypoints is the order of the tasks. Then, the minimal path is the sum of the distances between consecutive waypoints, considering that movement is only possible in the clockwise direction.\n\nBut wait, what if the next waypoint is behind the current position in the clockwise direction? Like, if current position is 3, and the next waypoint is 2, but movement is only clockwise. So she can't go back. So, she has to go all the way around the ring to reach 2.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction, she can't just go back. So, for instance, if she is at 3 and needs to go to 2, but movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction, she cannot directly go to 2. She has to go 3→4→1→2, which is a distance of 3 steps.\n\nWait, but wait. How can she reach 2 from 3 when she can only move clockwise? Because 3 is followed by 4, then 1, then 2. So, the distance is 3 steps.\n\nSo in that case, the minimal path from 3 to 2 is 3 steps.\n\nHmm, so the problem reduces to, given a starting point (1), and a list of waypoints in the order of the tasks, compute the minimal time to visit all waypoints, moving only in the clockwise direction, and each step is moving to the next house in the ring.\n\nSo, the total time is the sum of the distances between each consecutive pair of waypoints, plus any necessary loops.\n\nWait, but how do we handle the cases where a waypoint is encountered again later in the list? Like, if the list is [3,2,3], then the second 3 is after 2. So, she goes from 1 to 3 (distance 2), then from 3 to 2 (distance 3), then from 2 to 3 (distance 1). So total is 2+3+1=6, which matches the example.\n\nSo, the approach is to:\n\n1. Start at position 1.\n\n2. For each task in the order given, go to the corresponding a_i, moving only clockwise, and adding the required steps to the total time.\n\n3. The minimal time is the sum of all these steps.\n\nBut wait, is this always the case? What if a_i is earlier than the current position in the ring? Like, if current position is 3, and the next a_i is 2. She can't go directly, so she has to go around the ring.\n\nSo, in that case, the distance is (a_i - current_pos) mod n. Wait, no, because for current_pos=3, a_i=2, (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod4 is 3, which is correct, as she needs to take 3 steps.\n\nYes. So, the distance between current and next is (next - current) mod n.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Sort the tasks in the order they appear.\n\n- For each consecutive pair in the sorted list, calculate the distance between them in the clockwise direction, and sum them all.\n\nWait, but the initial position is 1. So the first a_1 is the first task. So, the distance from 1 to a_1 is (a_1 - 1) mod n. If a_1 is 3 and n=4, that's 2 steps.\n\nThen, from a_1 to a_2, the distance is (a_2 - a_1) mod n, etc.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the a_i's are [3,2,3]. So the steps are:\n\n1 →3: 2 steps.\n\n3→2: 3 steps (as (2-3) mod4 is 3).\n\n2→3: 1 step.\n\nTotal 2+3+1=6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: in the second input given, the output is 2. The input is '4 3\\n2 3 3'.\n\nSo the a_i's are 2,3,3.\n\nCompute the steps:\n\nStart at 1.\n\n1 →2: (2-1) mod4=1 step.\n\n2→3: 1 step.\n\n3→3: 0 steps.\n\nTotal 2 steps. Which matches the output.\n\nSo, the approach seems to work.\n\nBut wait, what if the list is not sorted? Like, suppose the list is [3,2,4,1]. Then the steps would be 1→3 (2 steps), 3→2 (3 steps), 2→4 (2 steps), 4→1 (1 step). Total 8 steps.\n\nBut let's see: is that the minimal path?\n\nYes, because she can't go back, so she must go around the ring each time.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n1. Take the list of a_i's as given in the input.\n\n2. Compute the distance between each consecutive a_i, as well as from the starting point (1) to the first a_i.\n\n3. Sum all these distances.\n\nSo, the code can be written as follows:\n\n- Read n and m.\n\n- Read the list of a_i's.\n\n- Compute the total steps as (a_1 - 1) mod n, plus the sum from i=2 to m of (a_i - a_{i-1}) mod n.\n\nWait, no. Because the mod is applied to each difference.\n\nWait, for each pair (current, next), the distance is (next - current) mod n. So, for the first step, it's (a_1 -1) mod n. Then, for each subsequent step, it's (a_i - a_{i-1}) mod n.\n\nWait, but why mod n? Because for a_i greater than a_{i-1}, the difference is positive. For a_i less than a_{i-1}, the difference is negative, but mod n gives the correct distance.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nsum += (a[0] - 1) % n\n\nfor i in range(1, m):\n\n    sum += (a[i] - a[i-1]) %n\n\nBut wait, what if m is 0? No, m is at least 1.\n\nSo, for example, in the second test case, the a list is [2,3,3].\n\nFirst step: 2-1=1 mod4 is 1.\n\nSecond step: 3-2=1 mod4 is 1.\n\nThird step: 3-3=0 mod4 is 0.\n\nTotal 2 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=2, a=[5,4]. \n\nDistance from 1 to5: (5-1) mod5=4 steps.\n\nThen from5 to4: (4-5) mod5= -1 mod5=4 steps.\n\nTotal 8 steps.\n\nSo, the code should compute 4+4=8.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read the list of a's.\n\n- Compute the initial step from 1 to a[0].\n\n- For each subsequent a[i], compute the step from a[i-1] to a[i].\n\n- Sum all these steps.\n\nNow, handling the mod correctly is crucial.\n\nBut wait, what about when a[i] is smaller than a[i-1]? Like, a[i-1]=3, a[i]=2.\n\nThen, (2-3) modn is ( -1 ) modn, which is n-1. So that's correct, as she has to go all the way around.\n\nSo, the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, in Python, how to implement this.\n\nWe can read the input as follows:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen, compute the total steps.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nprev = 1\n\nfor ai in a_list:\n\n    diff = ai - prev\n\n    # mod n, but since it can be negative, we add n and then mod.\n\n    # Alternatively, compute (ai - prev) %n\n\n    total += (ai - prev) %n\n\n    prev = ai\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, that's the code.\n\nTesting this against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput: 4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nThe code computes:\n\nprev is initially 1.\n\nai=3: 3-1=2 mod4=2 → total=2.\n\nai=2: 2-3= -1 mod4=3 → total=5.\n\nai=3:3-2=1 mod4=1 → total=6.\n\nOutput 6, correct.\n\nSecond example:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3\n\nprev=1.\n\nai=2: 2-1=1 mod4=1 → total=1.\n\nai=3:3-2=1 mod4=1 → total=2.\n\nai=3:3-3=0 → total=2.\n\nOutput 2, correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=5, m=2, a=[5,4]\n\nCode computes:\n\n1 to5: 4 → total=4.\n\n5 to4: (4-5)=-1 mod5=4 → total=8.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, m=3, a=[3,1,2]\n\nSequence:\n\n1→3: (3-1)=2 mod3=2.\n\n3→1: (1-3) =-2 mod3=1. So, she goes 3→1 via 3→4 (but wait, n=3, so 3→1 is one step.\n\nWait, no. n=3, 3 is followed by 1. So moving from 3 to 1 is one step.\n\nSo, the code correctly adds 1.\n\nThen, 1→2: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 2+1+1=4.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nYes: 1→3 (2 steps), 3→1 (1 step), 1→2 (1 step). Total 4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, what about when m=1?\n\nFor example, n=2, m=1, a=[2].\n\nSteps: 1→2: 1 step. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,2].\n\nSteps: 1→2 (1), 2→2 (0). Total 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nThus, the solution is to sum the differences modulo n, considering the movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a ring-shaped road in a clockwise direction. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and she must complete all tasks with lower indices before moving on to higher ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves Xenia moving along a ring-shaped road where she can only move in the clockwise direction. She starts at house 1 and must visit each required house in the order of her tasks.\n2. **Intuition**: Since movement is restricted to the clockwise direction, the distance between two houses `a` and `b` is calculated as `(b - a) % n`, where `n` is the total number of houses. This formula accounts for the circular nature of the ring road.\n3. **Algorithm**: \n   - Read the input values for the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`.\n   - Read the list of houses where each task needs to be completed.\n   - Compute the total time by summing the distances between consecutive houses in the list, starting from house 1 to the first task location, and then between each subsequent task location.\n4. **Complexity**: The algorithm runs in O(m) time complexity, which is efficient given the constraints (1 ≤ m ≤ 105).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal_time = 0\ncurrent_position = 1\n\nfor a in a_list:\n    distance = (a - current_position) % n\n    total_time += distance\n    current_position = a\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`, followed by the list of houses where each task needs to be completed.\n- **Calculating Distance**: For each task location, the distance from the current position is calculated using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ring road.\n- **Summing Distances**: The total time is accumulated by summing the distances between consecutive task locations, starting from house 1.\n- **Output**: The total time is printed, representing the minimum time required for Xenia to complete all her tasks.\n\nThis approach ensures that Xenia moves optimally along the ring road, always taking the shortest path in the clockwise direction to minimize her travel time.",
