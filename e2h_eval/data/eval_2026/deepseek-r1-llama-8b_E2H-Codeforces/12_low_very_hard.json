The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Xenia is trying to complete her tasks by moving along a ringroad. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem statement says that Xenia lives in a city with n houses arranged in a ring. The traffic is one-way and clockwise. She starts at house 1 and has m tasks. For each task i, she needs to be at house a_i. But not just that—she also has to complete all tasks with numbers less than i. So for the first task (i=1), she must be at a_1, then for the second task, she must be at a_2 after the first is done, and so on.\n\nWait, wait. Oh right, no—the description says she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me read that again.\n\nThe i-th task requires her to be in a_i and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Hmm, perhaps it's that for each task i, she must have already completed all j < i. So the order of tasks is from 1 to m, and for each i, she must be at a_i before starting the i-th task. Or wait, maybe the order is the order of the tasks as given. Because the problem says \"the i-th task\" needs to be done after all j < i are done. So the tasks are processed in the order 1, 2, ..., m. And for each i, she must be present at a_i when she starts the i-th task.\n\nSo the sequence is: she starts at 1. Then, for each task i from 1 to m:\n\n- She must be at a_i.\n- She can then perform whatever actions, but the next task will require her to be at a_{i+1}.\n\nBut wait, how do the movements happen? Because the movement is along the ring, which is circular. So the key is to find the optimal path that covers all the required positions in the correct order, with minimal time.\n\nHmm, so the minimal time would involve finding the shortest path that starts at 1, then visits a_1, then a_2, etc., up to a_m, possibly looping around the ring as needed.\n\nBut considering that the ring is circular, the distance between two points can be computed as the minimum of the clockwise and counter-clockwise paths. However, since the traffic is one-way and clockwise, she can't go counter-clockwise. So the movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction, meaning that from any house x, she can only move to x+1, x+2, etc., modulo n.\n\nWait, no. The problem says the ringroad is one way and also is clockwise. So moving along the ring is only possible in the clockwise direction. So the movement is strictly in one direction. So from house 4, she can only go to 1, then 2, then 3, etc. She can't go back to 3.\n\nThis changes everything. Because now, the movement is constrained—she can't move counter-clockwise, only clockwise.\n\nSo the movement is like a cycle where you can only go forward. So the positions are arranged in a circle, and once you pass a certain point, you can't go back.\n\nWait, but house 1 is connected to house 2, which is connected to 3, ..., up to house n, which connects back to house 1. So if she's at house n, she can only move to 1, then 2, etc.\n\nSo the way to model this is that the ring is a directed cycle where each node points to the next node in a circular fashion.\n\nIn this case, the movement is strictly along the cycle. So the distance between two nodes is the minimal number of steps to get from the first to the second by moving only in the clockwise direction.\n\nBut since she can't go back, the path from x to y (y >=x) is (y - x) steps if y >=x, else (n -x + y) steps.\n\nWait, no. Because for example, if she's at house 4 and needs to get to house 2, the clockwise path is 4 → 1 → 2, which takes 2 steps. The direct counter-clockwise path would be shorter, but she can't take that because the ring is one-way.\n\nSo the movement is only possible in the clockwise direction, so the distance between a and b is (b - a) mod n if b > a, or (n - a + b) mod n if b < a. Wait, no. Wait, for a=4, b=2, the clockwise distance is 4 →1→2, which is 2 steps.\n\nSo the formula for clockwise distance from x to y is (y -x)",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a one-way ringroad in a clockwise direction. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and she must complete all previous tasks before starting the next one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Ring Structure**: The houses are arranged in a ring, meaning house `n` is connected back to house `1`. Movement is strictly clockwise, so Xenia can only move from house `i` to house `(i % n) + 1`.\n\n2. **Task Completion Order**: Xenia starts at house `1` and must complete tasks in the given order. Each task `i` requires her to be at house `a_i` after completing all previous tasks.\n\n3. **Optimal Path Calculation**: For each task, calculate the minimal steps needed to move from the current house to the required house for the task. Since movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction, the distance between two houses `x` and `y` is `(y - x) % n` if `y > x`, otherwise it wraps around using the ring structure.\n\n4. **Summing Up Distances**: Sum the distances calculated for each task to get the total minimal time required to complete all tasks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor i in range(m):\n    target = a[i]\n    if target > current:\n        total_time += (target - current)\n    else:\n        total_time += (n - current + target)\n    current = target\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Reading**: The code reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`, followed by the list of target houses for each task.\n- **Current Position Tracking**: Starts at house `1` and tracks the current house as it processes each task.\n- **Distance Calculation**: For each task, calculates the clockwise distance from the current house to the target house. If the target is ahead, it's a straightforward forward move; if behind, it wraps around the ring.\n- **Total Time Accumulation**: Accumulates the total time taken to reach each target house in sequence.\n\nThis approach ensures that Xenia completes each task in the minimum possible time while adhering to the constraints of the one-way ring road.",
