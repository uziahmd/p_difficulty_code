Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the number of valid Morse code substrings after each step of building a string S. Hmm, let's try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that each Morse code letter is represented by a string of 1-4 characters, consisting of 0s and 1s. But not all possible combinations are valid. There are four invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So any substring in S that corresponds exactly to one of these four shouldn't be counted as a valid English letter.\n\nWait, but the problem isn't just about counting valid letters. It's about counting all possible non-empty substrings that represent some valid letter. So for each position in S, I need to look at all possible substrings starting or ending there and check if they form a valid Morse code.\n\nBut considering that m can be up to 3000, a naive approach of checking every possible substring each time would be way too slow. I need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Maybe I can track for each position in S, the number of valid substrings ending at that position. That sounds promising.\n\nSo, for each new character added to S, I'll look back a few steps (up to 4 steps) and see if adding this new character forms a valid substring. For example, if the current character is '1', then I can look at the last 1, 2, 3, or 4 characters to form a substring of length 1, 2, 3, or 4. Each of these could be a valid Morse code if their combined string isn't one of the invalid ones.\n\nWait, but how do I efficiently track what substrings end at the current position?\n\nMaybe I can maintain a DP array where dp[i] represents the number of valid substrings ending at the i-th character. Then, for each new character, I can compute new values based on the previous few dp values.\n\nBut wait, the substrings can vary in length. So for each new character, I need to consider all possible lengths from 1 to 4 and see if the substring is valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each position i, I can keep track of the possible endings of substrings of different lengths. Like, for each i, I can track the last 1, 2, 3, 4 characters. Because any valid substring ending at i can be formed by appending the current character to a substring of length up to 3 before it.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let's say we have a variable current_substrings which keeps track of the counts for substrings ending at the current position. For each new character c (either '0' or '1'), we'll process it as follows:\n\nWe can create a temporary dictionary or variables to hold the counts for the new substrings. For each possible length l (from 1 to 4), we take the last l characters including the current one. We then check if this substring is valid. If it is, we add the count to the current result.\n\nWait, but that might not capture all possibilities. Because for each new character, the new substrings are those that end with it, possibly starting anywhere from the last 3 characters back.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: for each position i, we can track the number of valid substrings ending exactly at i, considering all possible lengths up to 4.\n\nSo, let's say we have an array dp where dp[i] is the number of valid substrings ending at position i.\n\nFor each new character s_i, we can look at the previous 3 positions (i-1, i-2, i-3) and see if adding s_i creates a valid substring of length 4, 3, 2, or 1.\n\nBut how do we handle this without checking all possibilities each time?\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model it like this:\n\nInitialize dp[0] = 0.\n\nFor each i from 1 to m:\n   current_char = s[i]\n   total = 0\n   for j in range(1, 5):\n       start = i - j + 1\n       if start < 0:\n           continue\n       substring = s[start:i+1]\n       if substring not in invalid:\n           total += dp[start-1]  # because dp[start-1] is the count of substrings ending at start-1, which when extended by substring gives a longer substring\n   dp[i] = total\n\nWait, but this seems a bit off. Because for a substring of length j, the number of new valid substrings is the sum of all valid substrings ending at the previous j-1 steps, plus 1 if the substring itself is valid. Or wait, no— because dp[i] should represent the total number of valid substrings ending at i.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each new character, I can compute the contribution to the total based on the previous characters.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's consider that for each new character, the new valid substrings are those that end with it and have length 1, 2, 3, or 4. Each such substring can be built by taking the current character and adding it to the end of a substring of length 1, 2, 3, etc., from the previous characters.\n\nBut how to avoid duplicate counts? Because the same substring can be extended in multiple ways.\n\nWait, perhaps for each position i, the number of new valid substrings ending at i is the sum of the previous 1, 2, 3, 4 positions, but only if adding the current character makes the substring valid.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a rolling array where for each i, I look back up to 3 steps, and for each possible length (1-4), check if the substring is valid, and accumulate the count.\n\nBut checking all possible substrings each time would be O(m * 4), which for m=3000 is manageable.\n\nSo, here's an idea:\n\nWe'll maintain a variable 'total' which accumulates the sum of all valid substrings so far. For each new character, we can look back 1, 2, 3, and 4 steps to see if the substring ending at the current position is valid. For each valid substring, we add the number of such substrings to 'total'.\n\nWait, but how to calculate the number of valid substrings ending at each position. Maybe for each new character, we can compute the number of new substrings that end here and are valid.\n\nLet me think of it step by step.\n\nSuppose after adding the i-th character (0-based or 1-based?), we look at the last 1, 2, 3, 4 characters. For each possible length l (1 to 4), we extract the substring, check if it's valid, and if it is, add the count of substrings ending at the previous l-1 steps.\n\nWait, maybe that's getting complicated. Let me try to model it.\n\nLet's index the string from 0 to m-1. For each i, after adding the i-th character, we can look back 1, 2, 3, 4 steps (if possible). For each possible length l (1 to 4), the substring is s[i-l+1 ... i]. We need to check if this substring is valid (not one of the four invalid ones). If it is valid, then the number of valid substrings ending at i is equal to the number of valid substrings ending at i-l, plus 1 (the new substring itself).\n\nWait, no. Because for each l, the substring s[i-l+1 ... i] can be considered as a new valid substring. The number of times this substring appears depends on how many times it's formed by extending previous substrings.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this with a dynamic programming approach where for each position i, we track the number of valid substrings ending at i for each possible length l (1-4). So, for each i, we can have a list dp_l where dp_l[j] represents the number of substrings ending at i with length j.\n\nThen, for each new character, we can compute these dp_l[j] values.\n\nSo, let's structure it like this:\n\nWe have a list of lists dp, where dp[i][j] represents the number of substrings ending at position i with length j, and being valid.\n\nBut given that m can be up to 3000, and j can be up to 4, this is manageable.\n\nThe transition would be:\n\nFor each i from 0 to m-1:\n   for j from 1 to 4:\n       if i >= j-1:\n           substring = s[i-j+1 ... i]\n           if substring is valid:\n               if j == 1:\n                   dp[i][j] = 1\n               else:\n                   dp[i][j] = dp[i-j][j-1]\n           else:\n               dp[i][j] = 0\n   total += sum(dp[i][j] for j in 1..4)\n\nWait, but for j=2, dp[i][2] = dp[i-1][1], because the new substring is two characters, and the first part is a valid substring of length 1.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this captures all cases correctly.\n\nAlternatively, for each position i, for each possible length l (1-4), check if the substring ending at i of length l is valid. If it is, then the number of such substrings is equal to the number of substrings ending at i-l, of length l-1, plus 1 if the substring itself is valid.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the example.\n\nIn the first sample input, after adding three '1's, the string is \"111\". The valid substrings are:\n\n- \"1\" (positions 0)\n- \"11\" (positions 0-1)\n- \"111\" (positions 0-2)\n- \"1\" (positions 1)\n- \"11\" (positions 1-2)\n- \"1\" (positions 2)\n\nSo, each step adds new substrings.\n\nAt each step, for each new character, we can check all possible substrings ending at that position and count them.\n\nSo, perhaps for each i, the number of new valid substrings is the sum over l=1 to 4 of (if the last l characters form a valid substring, then 1 plus the number of valid substrings of length l-1 ending at i-l).\n\nWait, no. Because for l=2, the substring is built by adding the current character to a substring of length 1 ending at i-1. So the count for l=2 is the count of valid substrings of length 1 ending at i-1, since each of those can be extended by the current character to form a valid substring of length 2.\n\nWait, but this is only true if the new substring (of length l) is valid.\n\nSo the algorithm can be structured as follows:\n\nInitialize a variable total = 0.\n\nFor each new character c in the string:\n\n   create a variable added = 0\n\n   for l in 1 to 4:\n\n       if i >= l-1 (since we're 0-based):\n\n           substring = s[-l:]\n\n           if substring is valid:\n\n               if l == 1:\n\n                   added += 1\n\n               else:\n\n                   added += dp[i - l + 1][l-1]\n\n   total += added\n\n   output total mod MOD\n\n   update dp[i] with the counts for each l.\n\nWait, but how to manage the dp array.\n\nPerhaps, for each i, we can keep a dictionary that holds for each possible l, the count of valid substrings ending at i of length l.\n\nSo, for each i, we process each possible l (1 to 4). For each l, if the substring s[i-l+1 ... i] is valid, then the count is 1 plus the count from i-l's (l-1)th position.\n\nWait, no. Because the count for l is the number of substrings ending at i with length l. Each such substring is either:\n\n- A new substring of length l, which is the substring s[i-l+1 ... i], if it's valid.\n\nOR\n\n- An extension of a substring of length l-1 ending at i-l, by adding the current character. So, for each such extension, it contributes 1 substring.\n\nSo, for l=1: the substring is just c. If it's valid, then the count is 1.\n\nFor l>1: the substring is the previous l-1 substring plus c. So, the count is the count from l-1 at i-l.\n\nBut wait, that's not entirely correct. Because for l=2, the substring is two characters. The count is the number of valid substrings of length 1 ending at i-1 (since adding the current character to each of those forms a valid substring of length 2).\n\nWait, maybe yes. So for each l, the count is the sum of the counts from l-1 at i-l, plus 1 if the current substring is valid.\n\nWait, no. Because for l=2, the count is the number of substrings of length 1 ending at i-1, because each such substring can be extended by the current character to form a valid substring of length 2.\n\nBut only if the substring of length 2 is valid. So, the count for l=2 is equal to the count of valid substrings of length 1 ending at i-1, multiplied by whether the substring of length 2 is valid.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the key. For each l, the substring is valid only if the entire l-length substring is valid. So, for each l, the count is 0 unless the substring is valid, in which case it's equal to the count from l-1 at i-l plus 1.\n\nWait, no, because when you have a substring of length l, it can be formed by adding the current character to a substring of length l-1 ending at i-1. So the count for l is the number of valid substrings of length l-1 ending at i-1, provided that the substring of length l is valid.\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. Because the substring of length l may be invalid, in which case it doesn't contribute.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each i, for each l in 1..4:\n\n   if the substring s[i-l+1 ... i] is valid:\n\n       if l == 1:\n\n           count_l = 1\n\n       else:\n\n           count_l = dp[i-l][l-1]\n\n       dp[i][l] = count_l\n\n   else:\n\n       dp[i][l] = 0\n\nThen, the total is the sum of all dp[i][l] for l=1..4.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for each new character, we process each possible l (1 to 4), check if the substring is valid, and if so, set dp[i][l] to the appropriate value.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, I'll need a helper function to check if a substring is valid.\n\nThe four invalid substrings are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". So, for any substring, if it's one of these four, it's invalid.\n\nSo, the helper function is something like:\n\ndef is_valid(sub):\n    return sub not in {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n\nNext, I need to build the dp structure. Since for each i, we only need the previous 3 entries (for l=4, we look back 3 steps), we can optimize space by using a rolling array.\n\nWait, but for l=4, looking back 3 steps would mean checking i-3, but i is 0-based. So for l=4, i must be >=3 (since i starts at 0).\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to have a separate array for each l. Alternatively, since l is small, we can have a dictionary per i.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps we can track for each i the possible l's and their counts.\n\nSo, let's proceed step by step.\n\nInitialize a list of dictionaries, where dp[i] is a dictionary mapping l to the count of substrings ending at i with length l.\n\nWe'll also have a variable 'total' that accumulates the sum of all valid substrings so far.\n\nFor each character in the input:\n\n   i = current index (0-based)\n   c = current character\n\n   for l in 1 to 4:\n\n       start = i - l + 1\n       if start < 0:\n           continue  # not enough characters\n       sub = S[start:i+1]  # since S is 0-based, from start to i inclusive\n       if is_valid(sub):\n           if l == 1:\n               count = 1\n           else:\n               # look up the previous l-1 count\n               # but for l-1, the previous position is i - l + 1 + (l-1) -1 = i - l?\n               # Wait, no. For l, we have the substring ending at i with length l.\n               # So for l, the previous position is i - l, and the length is l-1.\n               # So, the count is dp[i - l][l-1] if i - l >=0 else 0\n               if (i - l) >= 0:\n                   prev_count = dp[i - l].get(l-1, 0)\n               else:\n                   prev_count = 0\n               count = prev_count\n           dp[i][l] = count\n       else:\n           dp[i][l] = 0\n\n   # Now, add all the counts for this i to the total\n   current_total = sum(dp[i].values())\n   total += current_total\n   print(total % MOD)\n\nWait, but initializing the dp as a list of dictionaries might be a bit tricky. Also, for l=1, the previous position is i-1, but for l=1, l-1 is 0, which doesn't exist. So the initial condition is that for l=1, the count is 1 if the substring is valid.\n\nBut what about when i is less than l-1? For example, when i=0 and l=2, start would be -1, so we skip.\n\nSo, in code, for each i, we loop l from 1 to 4. For each l, we check if start is >=0. If not, continue.\n\nNow, the main issue is handling the dp correctly.\n\nLet me outline the code structure.\n\nMOD = 10**9 +7\n\ninvalid = {'0011', '0101', '1110', '1111'}\n\nm = int(input())\ns = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    line = input().strip()\n    s.append(line[0])\n\n# Initialize dp as a list of dictionaries\ndp = [{} for _ in range(m)]\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(m):\n    c = s[i]\n    current_dp = {}\n    for l in range(1,5):\n        start = i - l + 1\n        if start <0:\n            continue\n        sub = s[start:i+1]\n        if sub in invalid:\n            current_dp[l] = 0\n            continue\n        if l ==1:\n            current_dp[l] =1\n        else:\n            prev_pos = i - l\n            if prev_pos >=0:\n                prev_count = dp[prev_pos].get(l-1,0)\n            else:\n                prev_count =0\n            current_dp[l] = prev_count\n    # Add the current_dp to the total\n    sum_l = sum(current_dp.values())\n    total = (total + sum_l) % MOD\n    # Update dp[i]\n    dp[i] = current_dp.copy()\n\n    # Print the total after each step\n    print(total % MOD)\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let's test this logic with the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1']\n\nSo, m=3, and the string is '1','1','1'.\n\nLet's walk through each step.\n\ni=0 (c='1'):\n\nCheck l=1: substring is '1' → valid → current_dp[1]=1.\n\nl=2: start =0-2+1 = -1 → skip.\n\nSimilarly for l=3,4: start is negative.\n\ncurrent_dp has {1:1}. sum is 1. total becomes 1.\n\nOutput: 1.\n\ni=1 (c='1'):\n\nCheck l=1: '1' → valid → 1.\n\nl=2: substring '11' → is it valid?\n\nLooking at invalid set: no. So sub is valid.\n\nSince l=2, look back to i -2= -1 → no. So current_dp[2] =0.\n\nWait, wait. No, l=2's prev_pos is i -2 =1-2= -1. So prev_count is 0.\n\nSo current_dp[2] =0.\n\nl=3: substring '111'? Wait, no, i is 1, so s[start=1-3+1= -1 → invalid. So l=3 is skipped.\n\nSimilarly, l=4 is skipped.\n\nSo current_dp is {1:1, 2:0}.\n\nSum is 1. total becomes 1+1=2.\n\nWait, but according to the sample, after the second step, the output is 3.\n\nWait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, in the sample after two '1's, the string is '11'. The valid substrings are '1' (twice), '11' (once). So total is 3.\n\nBut according to the code above, for i=1:\n\nl=1: '1' → count 1.\n\nl=2: substring '11' is valid. So for l=2, since l>1, prev_pos =1-2= -1, which is invalid. So current_dp[2] =0.\n\nSo sum is 1 (l=1) +0 (l=2) =1. Adding to total, which was 1, gives 2. But the correct total is 3.\n\nHmm, so the code is undercounting.\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nAh, I see. Because for l=2, the substring '11' is valid, but the code is assuming that the count is the number of valid substrings of length 1 ending at i-l (which is i-2= -1, so 0), but in reality, for l=2, the substring is '11', which is valid, and the count should be 1, not 0.\n\nWait, no. Because for l=2, the substring is '11', which is valid. So the count for l=2 is the number of valid substrings of length 1 ending at i-1 (i=1, l=2: i-l= -1. So no). So the code is not capturing this.\n\nWait, perhaps the logic is flawed. Because for l=2, the substring is '11', which is valid. So, the count is 1 (the substring itself) plus any extensions from previous.\n\nWait, no. Because in this case, the substring is '11', which is a new substring, so it contributes 1. But according to the code, for l=2, it's looking at the previous l-1 (1) position, which is i-l= -1, so it returns 0. So the code is not adding 1 for this case.\n\nSo the code is missing this case. Hmm.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: for each l, the substring is valid, and the count for l is 1 plus the count from l-1 at i-l.\n\nWait, but for l=2, the substring '11' is valid, but the previous position is i-2= -1, which is invalid. So the count for l=2 is 1 (the substring itself) plus 0 (since there's no l-1=1 substring ending at i-2=-1). So the code is correct in setting it to 1.\n\nWait, but in the code, for l=2, the code does:\n\ncurrent_dp[l] = dp[i - l].get(l-1, 0)\n\nBut i - l is 1-2= -1, which is invalid. So dp[-1] is accessed, which is out of bounds.\n\nWait, no. Because in the code, for l=2, the start is i - l +1 = 1-2+1=0. So the substring is s[0:1+1] → s[0:2] → '11' → valid.\n\nThen, for l=2, the code looks at dp[i-l] = dp[1-2= -1], which is invalid. So the code is trying to access dp[-1], which is not in the list.\n\nSo, in the code, we need to handle cases where i-l is <0.\n\nThus, in the code, for l=2:\n\nprev_pos = i-l =1-2= -1.\n\nprev_count is 0.\n\nSo current_dp[2] =0.\n\nBut that's wrong because the substring '11' is valid, so it should contribute 1.\n\nAh! So the code is not considering the case where the substring itself is valid, regardless of any previous substrings.\n\nSo, the code is only adding 1 for l=1, but for l>1, it's adding the count from l-1 at i-l. But for l=2, the substring '11' is valid, but since i-l is -1, it adds 0, but the substring itself is a new valid substring.\n\nSo the code is undercounting.\n\nSo the approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative plan: For each l, if the substring is valid, the count is 1 plus the count from l-1 at i-l, but only if i-l >=0.\n\nWait, but for l=2, i-l is -1, which is invalid. So for l=2, the count is 1 (the substring itself), but for l>1, the count is the sum of the previous l-1 substrings plus 1 if the current substring is valid.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nfor each l, if substring is valid:\n\n   if l ==1:\n\n       count =1\n\n   else:\n\n       count = (dp[i-l][l-1] if i-l >=0 else 0) + 1\n\nBut that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach should be modified to include the substring itself as a valid option, regardless of previous substrings.\n\nWait, maybe the correct way is:\n\nFor each l in 1..4:\n\n   if substring is valid:\n\n       if l ==1:\n\n           count = 1\n\n       else:\n\n           count = dp[i-l][l-1] + 1\n\nBecause the substring itself is valid, and any previous substrings ending at i-l of length l-1 can be extended.\n\nWait, but in the sample case where l=2, i-l =1-2=-1. So dp[-1][1] is not accessible. So in that case, the count would be 0 +1=1, which is correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula is:\n\nfor l in 1..4:\n\n   if substring is valid:\n\n       if l ==1:\n\n           count =1\n\n       else:\n\n           if (i-l) >=0:\n\n               count = dp[i-l][l-1] +1\n\n           else:\n\n               count =1\n\nThis way, for l=2, the substring is valid, and i-l is -1, so count is 1.\n\nIn the first step (i=0, l=1): count is 1.\n\nIn the second step (i=1, l=1): count is 1.\n\nFor l=2: substring '11' is valid, i-l = -1, so count is 1.\n\nSo current_dp for i=1 is {1:1, 2:1} → sum is 2.\n\nAdding to total: 1 (after i=0) + 2 → total 3.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSimilarly, for i=2, c='1':\n\nCheck l=1: '1' → valid → count 1.\n\nl=2: substring '11' → valid. i-l=0, so dp[0][1] is 1. So count =1 +1=2.\n\nl=3: substring '111' is valid. i-l= -1 → count is 1.\n\nl=4: start is 2-4+1= -1 → skip.\n\nSo current_dp is {1:1, 2:2, 3:1} → sum is 4. Total is 3+4=7.\n\nWhich matches the sample's third output.\n\nSo, the corrected approach is:\n\nfor each l in 1..4:\n\n   if substring is valid:\n\n       if l ==1:\n\n           count =1\n\n       else:\n\n           if (i - l) >=0:\n\n               count = dp[i-l][l-1] + 1\n\n           else:\n\n               count =1\n\n       current_dp[l] = count\n\n   else:\n\n       current_dp[l] =0\n\nSo, updating the code accordingly.\n\nSo, in the code, for each l:\n\nsub = s[start:i+1]\n\nif sub is valid:\n\n   if l ==1:\n\n       count =1\n\n   else:\n\n       if (i - l) >=0:\n\n           prev_count = dp[i-l].get(l-1, 0)\n\n       else:\n\n           prev_count =0\n\n       count = prev_count +1\n\n   current_dp[l] = count\n\nelse:\n\n   current_dp[l] =0\n\nWait, but wait. Why are we adding 1 in the else case?\n\nBecause the substring itself is a valid substring of length l, so it contributes 1. And any substrings of length l-1 ending at i-l can be extended by the current character, contributing their count.\n\nSo, for l=2, the substring '11' is valid. So, the count is 1 (itself) plus dp[i-2][1], which is 0 (since i-2 is -1), so total 1.\n\nFor l=3, substring '111' is valid. i-l = 2-3 = -1. So, count is 1.\n\nFor l=4, substring is '1111', which is invalid, so count is 0.\n\nThus, the code needs to be updated.\n\nSo, the revised code will be:\n\nfor i in range(m):\n    c = s[i]\n    current_dp = {}\n    for l in range(1,5):\n        start = i - l +1\n        if start <0:\n            continue\n        sub = ''.join(s[start:i+1])\n        if sub in invalid:\n            current_dp[l] =0\n            continue\n        if l ==1:\n            current_dp[l] =1\n        else:\n            if (i - l) >=0:\n                prev_count = dp[i - l].get(l-1, 0)\n            else:\n                prev_count =0\n            current_dp[l] = prev_count +1\n    sum_l = sum(current_dp.values())\n    total = (total + sum_l) % MOD\n    dp[i] = current_dp.copy()\n    print(total % MOD)\n\nWait, but in the sample case, when i=1 and l=2, the code correctly adds 1.\n\nTesting the sample again.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nAfter first character (i=0):\n\nsum is 1.\n\nAfter second character (i=1):\n\ncurrent_dp[1]=1, current_dp[2]=1.\n\nsum is 2. total is 1+2=3.\n\nAfter third character (i=2):\n\ncurrent_dp[1]=1, l=2: substring '11' is valid. i-l=0, dp[0][1]=1 → count=1+1=2.\n\nl=3: substring '111' is valid. i-l= -1 → count=1.\n\nSo current_dp is {1:1, 2:2,3:1}, sum is 4. total is 3+4=7.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code now correctly handles this case.\n\nAnother test case: what about the second sample.\n\nSample Input:\n\n5\n\n1 0 1 0 1.\n\nWait, let's see what happens after each step.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to proceed to write the code with this corrected approach.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead m, then read m lines, each line is a single character (0 or 1).\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to m-1:\n\n   c = s[i]\n\n   for l in 1..4:\n\n       start = i - l +1\n\n       if start <0: continue.\n\n       sub = s[start:i+1]\n\n       if sub in invalid: continue.\n\n       if l ==1:\n\n           count =1\n\n       else:\n\n           if (i - l) >=0:\n\n               prev_count = dp[i-l].get(l-1, 0)\n\n           else:\n\n               prev_count =0\n\n           count = prev_count +1\n\n       current_dp[l] = count\n\n   sum_l = sum(current_dp.values())\n\n   total += sum_l mod MOD\n\n   dp[i] = current_dp.copy()\n\n   print(total mod MOD)\n\nSo, implementing this in Python.\n\nNow, considering that m can be up to 3000, and for each i, processing up to 4 l's, it's manageable.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- When the substring is of length 1, which is always valid except for certain cases.\n\nWait, no: the four invalid substrings are all longer than 1, except for '0011' which is 4, but the others are 4,4,4,4.\n\nWait, the invalid substrings are all of length 4 except for '0011' which is length 4. So, any substring of length 1 is valid.\n\nSo, in code, for l=1, the substring is always valid, so current_dp[1] =1.\n\nThus, in code, for l=1, the count is 1.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when the substring is of length 4 and is invalid.\n\nSo, the code should not count it.\n\nAnother edge case: when the substring is of length 4 and is valid.\n\nLike '0000' → is that a valid Morse code?\n\nWait, according to the note, the four invalid substrings are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n\nSo, '0000' is valid.\n\nThus, the code correctly counts it.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nSo, putting it all together, here's the Python code.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented as valid Morse code substrings after each modification to an initially empty string. The result should be printed modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Morse Code Validity Check**: Each Morse code string is a sequence of dots (0) and dashes (1). Not all possible combinations are valid. Specifically, the strings \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\" are invalid.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: We use a DP array where `dp[i][l]` represents the number of valid Morse code substrings ending at position `i` with length `l`.\n3. **Rolling Update**: For each new character added to the string, we check all possible substrings ending at this character of lengths 1 to 4. If a substring is valid, we update our DP array accordingly.\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: For each new character, we look back up to 3 positions to consider substrings of lengths 1 to 4. We then update the total count of valid substrings.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\ninvalid = {'0011', '0101', '1110', '1111'}\n\nm = int(input())\ns = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    line = input().strip()\n    s.append(line[0])\n\ndp = [{} for _ in range(m)]\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(m):\n    c = s[i]\n    current_dp = {}\n    for l in range(1, 5):\n        start = i - l + 1\n        if start < 0:\n            continue\n        sub = ''.join(s[start:i+1])\n        if sub in invalid:\n            current_dp[l] = 0\n            continue\n        if l == 1:\n            current_dp[l] = 1\n        else:\n            if (i - l) >= 0:\n                prev_count = dp[i - l].get(l-1, 0)\n            else:\n                prev_count = 0\n            current_dp[l] = (prev_count + 1) % MOD\n    sum_l = sum(current_dp.values()) % MOD\n    total = (total + sum_l) % MOD\n    dp[i] = current_dp.copy()\n    print(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and stored in a list `s`, which represents the string being built.\n2. **DP Initialization**: A list of dictionaries `dp` is initialized to keep track of valid substrings ending at each position.\n3. **Processing Each Character**: For each character added to the string, we check substrings of lengths 1 to 4 ending at this character.\n4. **Validity Check**: Each substring is checked against the set of invalid strings. If valid, the count of such substrings is updated in the DP array.\n5. **Updating Total Count**: The total number of valid substrings is updated and printed after each modification.\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks valid substrings using dynamic programming, ensuring that we only consider valid Morse code sequences while handling up to 3000 modifications efficiently.",
