Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Vasily has some candles and can make new ones from the leftover stubs. The goal is to find out how many hours he can keep the room lit. Let's see.\n\nThe problem says that each candle burns for one hour before going out. So initially, he has 'a' candles, which will burn for 'a' hours. But then, for every 'b' stubs (which are the remains after a candle burns), he can make a new candle. So I think the process is like this: after burning all initial candles, collect the stubs, convert them into new candles, burn those, collect again, and repeat until he doesn't have enough stubs to make more.\n\nWait, but during this process, each time he makes new candles, they add to the total hours. Because each new candle burns for an hour, contributing to the total.\n\nSo the approach should be:\n\n1. Start with the initial number of candles 'a'. The total hours is a.\n2. Then, calculate how many stubs he has after burning all a candles: that's a stubs.\n3. For every b stubs, he can make 1 new candle. So the number of new candles is (a // b).\n4. Each new candle adds an hour to the total. So add (a // b) to the total.\n5. Now, the stubs from these new candles: each new candle gives 1 stub, so it's (a // b). So the new total stubs is (a % b) + (a // b) * 1. Wait, no, because the initial a gives a stubs, then the new candles give (a//b) stubs.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you burn a candles, you get a stubs. Then, using the stubs, you make (a // b) new candles. Each of these new candles when burned gives another stub. So the total stubs after this step is (a % b) + (new_candles).\n\nBecause:\n\n- a is the initial number. After burning, a stubs are made. Then, you use as many as possible to make new candles: (a // b) times. Each of these contributes 1 stub. So the remaining stubs after making new candles would be a % b. Then, adding the stubs from the new candles, which is (a // b).\n\nSo the next step's stubs are (a % b) + (a // b).\n\nThen, you add the new candles to the total hours. Because each new candle gives 1 hour. So the process continues.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Initialize total_hours = a\n- current_stubs = a\n- while current_stubs >= b:\n    new_candles = current_stubs // b\n    total_hours += new_candles\n    current_stubs = (current_stubs % b) + new_candles\n- Once the loop ends, return total_hours.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nLet me test this logic with the sample input.\n\nFirst sample: 4 2.\n\nInitial total:4.\n\ncurrent_stubs=4.\n\nLoop: 4 >=2.\n\nnew_candles=4//2=2. Add 2 → total becomes 6.\n\ncurrent_stubs =4%2=0 + 2 = 2.\n\nNow, 2 >=2.\n\nnew_candles=2//2=1. Add 1 → total 7.\n\ncurrent_stubs=0+1=1 <2. Loop stops.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample:6 3.\n\nInitial total:6.\n\ncurrent_stubs=6.\n\n6 >=3 → new=2. Total 8.\n\ncurrent_stubs=6%3=0 +2=2 <3. So loop stops. So output is 8.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where a is less than b? Like a=3, b=5.\n\nThen initial 3 hours. current_stubs=3 <5, so no more. Output 3.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=5.\n\nInitial 5 hours. stubs=5. Make 1 new, total 6. Stubs now 5-5=0 +1=1 <5. So total is 6.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=3.\n\nInitial 10.\n\nStubs=10.\n\n10//3=3, add 3 →13.\n\nStubs now: 10%3=1 +3=4.\n\n4 >=3 →1 new, add 1 →14.\n\nStubs:4%3=1 +1=2 <3. Stop. Total 14.\n\nYes, let's compute manually:\n\n10 →3 hours added (total 13), then 3 more candles (each burning 1h), so 13+3=16? Wait, wait, maybe my logic is wrong.\n\nWait wait, no. Let me re-calculate.\n\nWait, initial a=10. So 10 hours.\n\nStubs:10.\n\nMake 10//3=3 new candles. Each burns for 1h → 3 more hours. So total 13.\n\nThese 3 candles when burned give 3 stubs. So current_stubs is 10 -10 (used) =0, plus 3 stubs from new candles: 3. Then, 3 >=3 → make 1 candle, which burns for 1h → total 14.\n\nThat candle gives 1 stub. So current_stubs is 3-3=0 +1=1. So loop ends.\n\nSo yes, 14 is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm seems right.\n\nSo now, the plan is to write a Python code that reads a and b, then applies this logic.\n\nRead the input as two integers, a and b.\n\nCompute as per the steps above.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nRead the input line, split into a and b.\n\nInitialize total = a\n\ncurrent_stubs = a\n\nloop while current_stubs >=b:\n\n   new = current_stubs // b\n\n   total += new\n\n   current_stubs = current_stubs % b + new\n\nOnce loop ends, print total.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting with sample input:\n\nFor '4 2', it gives 7.\n\nFor '6 3', it gives 8.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nI think this should handle all cases, including when a is zero (but according to the problem statement, a is at least 1, so no issue).\n\nWhat about when b is 1? Well, according to the problem statement, b is at least 2, so that's not allowed.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo the Python code is straightforward.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nWe'll read the input as a single line, split into a and b.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a list, but in the problem statement, the input is two integers on a single line. So the input is a string like '4 2'.\n\nSo in code:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, proceed as per the logic.\n\nSo the code:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\ncurrent = a\nwhile current >= b:\n    new = current // b\n    total += new\n    current = current % b + new\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nI think that should do it.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has and the stubs from burned-out candles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles `a`, which will burn for exactly `a` hours.\n2. **Recycle Stubs**: After burning all initial candles, collect the stubs. For every `b` stubs, Vasily can make a new candle, which will then burn for another hour.\n3. **Iterative Process**: Continue converting stubs into new candles until there are not enough stubs left to make another candle. Each new candle contributes to the total hours of illumination.\n4. **Loop Until Exhaustion**: Use a loop to repeatedly convert stubs into new candles and add the resulting hours to the total until the number of stubs is less than `b`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\ncurrent_stubs = a\nwhile current_stubs >= b:\n    new_candles = current_stubs // b\n    total += new_candles\n    current_stubs = current_stubs % b + new_candles\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initial Burn**: The initial `a` candles burn for `a` hours.\n- **Stub Collection**: After burning all candles, collect the stubs.\n- **New Candles**: Convert stubs into new candles using the ratio `b`. Each new candle burns for 1 hour, adding to the total.\n- **Repeat**: Continue this process until the number of stubs is insufficient to make another candle.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the maximum hours by iterating through the process of converting stubs into new candles until no more can be made. The solution handles all edge cases and ensures optimal performance.",
