            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Vanya and Cards\n\nVanya loves playing. He even has a special set of cards to play with. Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Vanya is trying to balance the sum of his found cards to zero. The problem gives me the number of found cards (n) and the maximum absolute value x on any card. Also, it's given that all the found cards have numbers within -x to x. My task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find to make the total sum zero.\n\nHmm, let's think about this. The initial sum of the found cards can be calculated, and then we need to determine how many more cards (with values between -x and x) are needed so that when added, the total becomes zero.\n\nSo first, I'll calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum 'current_sum'. Then, the required sum to add is 'required' = -current_sum. Because the sum of all cards (found plus new) must be zero.\n\nNow, each new card can contribute a value between -x and x. But since we want the minimal number of cards, we should maximize each card's contribution towards the required sum. That means, for each new card, we should choose the maximum possible value in the positive direction if the required sum is positive, or the negative direction if the required sum is negative.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Suppose the required sum is S. We need to find the minimal k such that |S| <= k * x. Because each new card can contribute at most x towards the sum (if positive) or at least -x (if negative). So the minimal k is the ceiling of |S| divided by x.\n\nBut wait, what if |S| is exactly divisible by x? Then k is |S|/x. Otherwise, it's |S|/x + 1.\n\nFor example, if the required sum is 5 and x is 3. Then 5/3 is 1.666..., so we need 2 cards: one with 3 and another with 2, which adds up to 5. Or alternatively, two cards with 3 each would give 6, which is more than 5. Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Oh right, because each card can be any value between -x and x. So the maximum possible per card is x, and the minimal is -x.\n\nSo, to reach S with the least number of cards, each card should contribute as much as possible towards S. So for S positive, each card should be x, and as many as needed. Similarly, if S is negative, each card should be -x.\n\nSo the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of |S| / x. But wait, let's test some examples.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\n3 2\n-1 1 2\n\nThe sum is (-1) +1 +2 = 2. So required sum is -2. So |S|=2. x is 2. So 2/2=1. So one card of -2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond sample:\n\n2 3\n-2 -2\n\nSum is -4. Required sum is 4. x is 3. 4/3 is 1.333... so we need 2 cards. Each can contribute 3, totaling 6, which is more than 4. Alternatively, one card of 3 and another of 1, but that's also 2 cards. So the minimal is 2.\n\nSo yes, the formula is correct.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read n and x from input.\n2. Read the list of found cards.\n3. Compute current_sum as the sum of these cards.\n4. Compute required = -current_sum.\n5. If required is zero, no new cards are needed.\n6. Else, compute the minimal k as ceil(|required| / x).\n7. Output k.\n\nWait, but wait: what if required is zero? Then no new cards are needed. So that's a special case.\n\nNow, let's think about some edge cases.\n\nCase 1: All found cards sum to zero. So required is zero. So output 0.\n\nCase 2: Found sum is 5, x=5. So required is -5. So one card of -5.\n\nCase 3: Sum is 6, x=3. 6/3=2, so two cards of 3 each. Sum is 6.\n\nAnother case: sum is 5, x=2. 5/2=2.5 → ceil is 3. So three cards: 2+2+1. Or 3 cards contributing 2 each would give 6, which is more than 5, but that's allowed as long as the sum is reached.\n\nWait, but each card can be any value up to x. So for 5, using two 2's gives 4, but then the third card needs to be 1, which is allowed.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nSo now, the code.\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is two lines. First line has n and x. Second line has n integers.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsum_found = sum(cards)\nrequired = -sum_found\n\nif required == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # calculate minimal k\n    abs_required = abs(required)\n    k = (abs_required + x -1) // x  # this is integer division rounded up.\n    print(k)\n\nWait, let's test this with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\nsum is 2 → required is -2 → abs is 2. x=2. (2+2-1)//2 → (3)//2=1 → correct.\n\nSample 2:\nsum is -4 → required is 4. x=3. (4+3-1)/3=6/3=2 → correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x=5 → (5+5-1)//5=9//5=1 → correct.\n\nAnother test: sum is 4, x=3 → 4+3-1=6 → 6//3=2 → correct.\n\nWhat if required is 0? Like all found cards sum to zero. Then code will print 0.\n\nWhat if sum is 0 but x is 10? Then no new cards needed.\n\nAnother test: sum is 7, x=3. 7/3 is ~2.333, so ceil is 3. 3*3=9>7. So code would compute (7+3-1)//3 =9//3=3. Correct.\n\nSo seems solid.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nBut wait, what if the required sum is zero even before adding any cards? Like sum is zero. Then required is zero, so no cards needed. So code handles that.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is as above.\n\nWait, but the input is given as a string like '3 2\\n-1 1 2'—but in Python, when you split on '\\n', you get the two lines. So perhaps the second line is read correctly.\n\nTesting the code:\n\nFor the first sample input:\n\nInput is:\n\n3 2\n-1 1 2\n\nsum is (-1 +1 +2)=2. required is -2 → abs is 2. (2 +2-1) //2= (3)//2=1. So output is 1.\n\nSecond sample:\n\n2 3\n-2 -2\n\nsum is (-4). required is 4. (4+3-1)//3=6//3=2.\n\nSo outputs are 1 and 2, as expected.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nI think that's it.\n",
