There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck but let's try to think through it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on a street with certain spots. Each spot can have a house of height between 0 and h. Each house contributes a squared value to the profit. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in a certain range [l_i, r_i], the tallest house must be at most x_i. My goal is to maximize the total profit by choosing the heights optimally.\n\nHmm. So, how do I model this? It feels like an optimization problem with constraints. The variables are the heights of each spot, and the constraints are the m restrictions.\n\nWait, but with n up to 50, maybe a dynamic programming approach is feasible. Because 50 is manageable for certain DP solutions.\n\nLet me think about the possible states. Maybe for each position i, I can track the maximum possible height given the constraints up to that point. But how?\n\nAlternatively, I can model this as intervals and find for each interval what's the minimum allowed maximum height. Wait, but overlapping intervals complicate things because a spot might be covered by multiple restrictions. For example, a spot could be in two different restrictions, each imposing their own maximum. So, the height for that spot must be the minimum of all those maximums.\n\nSo, perhaps for each spot, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of all x_i where l_i ≤ i ≤ r_i. Additionally, each spot's height cannot exceed h.\n\nWait, yes! Because for a particular spot i, any restriction that includes i will impose that the height at i must be ≤ x_i. So the maximum possible height for spot i is the minimum of all x_i across all restrictions that cover i, but also not exceeding h.\n\nWait, no. Because if a spot is covered by multiple restrictions, say, two restrictions: one says max 5, another says max 3. Then the spot's height must be at most 3. So the effective maximum for spot i is the minimum x_j over all j where l_j ≤ i ≤ r_j, and also min(h).\n\nBut wait, not exactly. Because for a spot i, if it's covered by multiple restrictions, the maximum allowed is the minimum of all x_i's for those restrictions plus possibly h.\n\nWait, no. Each restriction on [l_i, r_i] requires that the maximum in that interval is ≤ x_i. So for each spot in that interval, their heights must be ≤ x_i. So for a spot i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum x of all restrictions that include i. If there are no such restrictions, then the maximum is h.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that each spot's height can be up to h. So for a spot not covered by any restriction, the maximum is h.\n\nSo the first thing I need to do is for each spot i, compute the maximum possible height it can have, which is the minimum of x from all restrictions that cover i, and also not more than h.\n\nWait, but for each spot i, if there are multiple restrictions covering it, the height can't exceed any of their x values. So for i, its maximum allowed is the minimum of x_j for all j where l_j ≤i ≤r_j. But if there are no such j, then it's h.\n\nSo for each spot, compute min_x = min of all x_i's in restrictions that include it. If none, min_x is h.\n\nOnce we have this min_x for each spot, the problem reduces to assigning each spot a height between 0 and its min_x (inclusive), such that the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nWait, but that's only true if the min_x is the tightest constraint. Because, for example, if I have a spot i whose min_x is 5, but in a restriction that includes i, maybe that same spot is part of a larger interval that has a higher x. But no, because the min is taken, the higher x's don't affect it.\n\nWait, perhaps that's correct. Because each restriction that covers i contributes x_i as an upper limit for the spot. So the maximum possible height for i is the smallest of all x_i's across those restrictions, but also not exceeding h.\n\nSo first, for each spot, I can compute this maximum allowed height.\n\nOnce I have these maximum allowed heights, the problem becomes: assign to each spot a height a_i where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ M_i (M_i is the computed max), such that the sum of a_i squared is as large as possible.\n\nBut wait, is that sufficient? Because the original problem's constraints are that for each interval [l_i, r_i], the maximum a_j in that interval is ≤ x_i. So, when I set M_i as the min of x_j's for each spot, I ensure that for each spot, a_i ≤ M_i, which implies that the maximum in any interval is ≤ the M_i of that spot. But does that ensure that for each interval, the maximum in that interval is ≤ x_i of that restriction?\n\nWait, no. Because suppose I have two restrictions:\n\nRestriction A: [1,3], x=5\n\nRestriction B: [2,4], x=3\n\nThen for spot 2, M_i is min(5,3) =3.\n\nFor spot 3, M_i is min(5, ...) depends on whether any other restrictions cover it. Suppose there's another restriction C: [3,5], x=4. Then for spot 3, M_i is min(5,4,3) =3.\n\nNow, in the interval [2,4], the maximum allowed is 3. But the restriction B requires the maximum in [2,4] to be ≤3, which is satisfied.\n\nWait, but perhaps my initial approach isn't sufficient. Because, even if each spot's M_i is correctly computed, the sum of squares may not satisfy some constraints on the intervals.\n\nWait, no. Because for any interval [l, r], the maximum a_i in that interval is the maximum of a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r. Since each a_i in that interval is ≤ M_i, which is the minimum of x's for that spot, including the x of the current restriction. So the maximum in that interval would be ≤ x of that restriction.\n\nWait, no. Because the M_i for each spot is the minimum of all x_j that cover it. So for a particular restriction K with [l, r] and x_k, the M_i for each spot in [l, r] includes x_k as one of the x's. So the maximum a_i in [l, r] is the maximum of all a_i's, which are each ≤ their respective M_i's. But since M_i's are each ≤ x_k (because x_k is one of the x's contributing to M_i), then the maximum a_i in [l, r] is ≤x_k.\n\nAh, right! Because for each spot i in [l, r], M_i is the minimum of x_j's for all j that include i. So x_k is one of those x_j's. So M_i <=x_k. Therefore, a_i <= M_i <=x_k. So the maximum a_i in [l, r] is <=x_k.\n\nSo the initial approach is correct. So, the steps are:\n\n1. For each spot i, compute M_i as the minimum of all x_j where i is in [l_j, r_j], or h if there are no such x_j.\n\n2. Now, the problem reduces to choosing a_i's such that 0<=a_i <= M_i, and the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nBecause this ensures that all the constraints are satisfied.\n\nSo now the problem is to compute the maximum sum of squares given the M_i's.\n\nThis seems like a much simpler problem. Now, the question is, how to maximize the sum of squares given that each a_i can be up to M_i.\n\nWhat's the optimal choice for each a_i? Well, the square function is increasing for non-negative numbers. So, to maximize the sum, each a_i should be as large as possible.\n\nTherefore, for each spot i, the optimal a_i is M_i.\n\nSo, the maximum profit is the sum of (M_i)^2 for each spot.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Are all the M_i's valid? Because in the problem statement, the city's own limit is h, which is the maximum height allowed for any spot. So, for each spot, M_i is the minimum of the x_j's and h.\n\nYes, because when computing M_i, we take the minimum of all x_j's that cover it, and then compare it to h. So M_i = min( min_x, h ). Or wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, the initial approach was to compute M_i as the minimum of all x_j that cover i, and then if that minimum is less than h, it's M_i. Otherwise, it's h? No, wait. Because h is the maximum allowed regardless of any other constraints. So, for any spot, if no restrictions cover it, M_i is h.\n\nWait, let me re-express M_i correctly:\n\nM_i = min( x_j for all j where l_j <=i <= r_j ) \n\nif there are such j's; else, M_i = h.\n\nSo, for each spot, M_i is the smallest x among all the restrictions that include it, and if there are no such restrictions, M_i is h.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the maximum sum is the sum of squares of M_i's for each spot.\n\nSo, the solution is straightforward:\n\nCompute M_i for each spot i.\n\nSum the squares of M_i's.\n\nThat's it.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1 1 1 → affects spot 1.\n\n2 2 3 → affects spot 2.\n\n3 3 2 → affects spot 3.\n\nSo, for each spot:\n\nSpot 1: min(1) → 1.\n\nSpot 2: min(3) →3.\n\nSpot 3: min(2) →2.\n\nSo, sum is 1^2 +3^2 +2^2= 1+9+4=14. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2 3 8 → affects spots 2 and 3.\n\n3 4 7 → affects spots 3 and 4.\n\nCompute M_i for each spot:\n\nSpot 1: no restrictions. So M_1 =10.\n\nSpot 2: min(8) →8.\n\nSpot 3: min(8,7)=7.\n\nSpot4: min(7) →7.\n\nSum is 10^2 +8^2 +7^2 +7^2 =100+64+49+49=262. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo, this approach works.\n\nThus, the solution is to compute M_i for each spot as the minimum of x_j of all restrictions covering it, or h if no restrictions, then sum the squares.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nFor each spot from 1 to n, collect all x_j where l_j <=i <=r_j.\n\nM_i is the minimum of those x_j's, or h if none.\n\nSum the squares of M_i.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nCreate an array M with size n+1 (since spots are 1-based). Initialize all M[i] to h.\n\nFor each of the m restrictions:\n\n   l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n   for i in range(l, r+1):\n\n       if M[i] > x:\n\n           M[i] = x\n\nSum the squares.\n\nPrint the sum.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because for each restriction, for each spot in its range, we check if the current M[i] is larger than x. If so, we set it to x, which effectively takes the minimum.\n\nYes, that's efficient and handles all cases.\n\nTesting this logic:\n\nIn the first example, for each spot:\n\nSpot 1: initially 3. The first restriction sets it to 1. So M[1]=1.\n\nSpot 2: Initially 3. The second restriction sets it to 3.\n\nSpot 3: Initially 3. Third restriction sets it to 2.\n\nSo the code correctly computes M as [1,3,2].\n\nIn the second example:\n\nSpot 1: remains 10.\n\nSpot 2: 10 → after first restriction, becomes 8.\n\nSpot3: starts at 10, then first restriction (covers 2-3) sets it to min(10,8)=8, then the second restriction (covers 3-4) sets it to min(8,7)=7.\n\nSpot4: starts at 10. Second restriction sets it to 7.\n\nThus, the code produces M as [10,8,7,7], summing to 262.\n\nAnother test case: suppose a spot is covered by multiple restrictions with varying x's.\n\nE.g., spot 2 is covered by restrictions:\n\n1-3, x=5\n\n2-4, x=3\n\n3-5, x=4.\n\nSo, for spot 2, the x's are 5,3,4. So M_i is 3.\n\nSo the code correctly sets it to 3.\n\nYes, this approach seems solid.\n\nSo, now, to implement this in Python.\n\nThe code structure would be:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nInitialize M as list of h for each spot from 0 to n (but 1-based indexing, so M[1]..M[n]).\n\nFor each of m lines:\n\n   Read l, r, x.\n\n   For i in l to r inclusive:\n\n       if M[i] > x:\n\n           M[i] = x\n\nCompute the sum of M[i]^2 for i=1 to n.\n\nPrint the sum.\n\nYes, that's straightforward.\n\nTesting this code on the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nAfter processing:\n\nM[1] = min(3, 1) =1.\n\nM[2] = min(3,3) =3.\n\nM[3] = min(3,2) =2.\n\nSum is 1+9+4=14.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nProcessing:\n\nM[1] remains 10.\n\nM[2] is min(10,8) =8.\n\nM[3] is min(10,8,7) → min(8,7) is7.\n\nM[4] is min(10,7) =7.\n\nSum is 100 +64 +49 +49 =262.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, h=5, m=0.\n\nSo, M[1]=5. Sum is 25.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, h=10, m=1.\n\nRestriction: 1 2 5.\n\nSo M[1] =5, M[2]=5. Sum is 5² +5²=50.\n\nIf another restriction is added: 2 2 3.\n\nThen, M[2] becomes min(5,3)=3.\n\nSum is 25+9=34.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to given zoning restrictions.
