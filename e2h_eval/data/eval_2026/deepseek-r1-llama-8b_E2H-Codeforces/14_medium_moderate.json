He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where given a number of trailing zeros m, I have to find all the positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. Then, output the count of such n's and the numbers themselves in order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because there are always more multiples of 2 than 5, the number of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So, for each multiple of 5, we add one zero, but also for multiples of higher powers like 25, 125, etc.\n\nSo the formula for the number of trailing zeros Z(n) is:\nZ(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nThe task is, given m, to find all n such that Z(n) = m. And then return how many such n's exist and the list in order.\n\nWait, but how do I find the possible n's for a given m? Because the function Z(n) is non-decreasing as n increases. It can stay the same for several consecutive n's before increasing again.\n\nFor example, let's take m=5. The sample shows that the possible n's are 5,6,7,8,9. So Z(5) is 5//5=1, plus 5//25=0, so total 1. But wait, wait no—wait, 5! is 120, which has 1 zero. Wait, but the sample says m=1, but the output is 5,6,7,8,9. Oh right, in the sample input, the first case is '1' and the output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9. So for m=1, the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9 because Z(5)=1, Z(6)=1 (since 6//5 is 1, 6//25 is 0), same for 7,8,9. Then Z(10) would be 10//5 + 10//25 = 2 + 0 = 2, so m=2.\n\nSo for a given m, the possible n's form a consecutive range. We need to find the start and end of this range.\n\nSo the approach is to find the smallest n where Z(n) >= m, then check if it's exactly m. Then, see how far the consecutive n's go where Z(n) remains m.\n\nBut how to find the starting point?\n\nI think a binary search approach could work here. Because Z(n) is monotonically non-decreasing, for a given m, the minimal n where Z(n) equals m will give us the start. Then, we can find the maximal n where Z(n) is still m. The difference between max and min plus one is the count.\n\nSo step by step:\n\n1. Find the lower bound: the smallest n where Z(n) >= m. Let's call this low.\n   - If Z(low) > m, then there's no solution for m, so output 0.\n   - Else, check if Z(low) is exactly m. If not, search again.\n   - Wait, maybe better to use binary search to find the minimal n where Z(n) = m.\n\n2. Once the minimal n is found, then find the maximal n where Z(n) = m. This can be done by incrementing n until Z(n) exceeds m.\n\nAlternatively, since the function is monotonic, after finding the minimal n, the maximal n is the next n where Z(n) > m minus one.\n\nWait, perhaps using binary search to find the leftmost and rightmost positions where Z(n) = m.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Use binary search to find the minimal n such that Z(n) = m.\n   - If no such n exists (i.e., the minimal n where Z(n) >= m has Z(n) > m), output 0.\n- Then, find the maximal n where Z(n) = m. This can be done by searching until Z(n) exceeds m, then subtract one.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to find the lower and upper bounds.\n\nWait, let's think about how to compute the minimal n with Z(n) = m.\n\nWe can perform a binary search between 0 and some upper limit. What's the maximum possible n for a given m? Well, for m=1e5, the maximum n is at most 5*m, but probably less.\n\nWait, the maximum n for m is when all m comes from the highest power of 5. So for example, m = k, then n can be up to 5^k * (something). Hmm, but it's hard to estimate.\n\nSo, for binary search, the high can be set to something like 5 * m, but perhaps even higher.\n\nWait, for m=1, the n is 5, which is 5*1.\n\nFor m=2, n is 10, which is 5*2.\n\nFor m=3, n is 15, etc. So perhaps setting high as 5*m is sufficient.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Find the minimal n where Z(n) = m.\n\n   a. Initialize low=0, high=5*m.\n\n   b. While low <= high:\n\n      i. mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n      ii. Compute Z(mid)\n\n      iii. If Z(mid) < m: set low = mid + 1\n\n      iv. Else if Z(mid) > m: set high = mid -1\n\n      v. Else: set low = mid, high = mid.\n\n   c. After loop, if low's Z is not equal to m, then no solution. So output 0.\n\n   d. Else, record low as the start.\n\n2. Now, find the maximum n where Z(n) = m.\n\n   a. Start from low and keep checking n+1, n+2, etc., until Z(n) > m. The last n where Z(n) =m is the end.\n\n   b. But this might be time-consuming if the range is large. So perhaps a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the binary search for the minimal n, we can find the maximal n as well.\n\nWait, perhaps the same binary search can be adjusted to find the range.\n\nWait, another approach is to find the minimal n where Z(n) = m, and then find the next n where Z(n) exceeds m. The maximal n is that value minus 1.\n\nSo, once you have the minimal n, you can start from n and increment until Z(n) exceeds m, then stop. The last n is the maximal.\n\nSo for example, for m=5:\n\nStart with n=5: Z(5)=1 <5? No, wait m=5. Wait, no, in the sample, the input was '1' and the output was 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me restate the sample input: in the note, it says that for m=1, the output is 5 followed by 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nWait, wait, no—the sample input is ['1', '5'], but the output is:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWait, that suggests that for the first input, m=1, the output is 5 followed by the numbers 5 through 9, meaning there are 5 numbers. For the second input, m=5, there are zero numbers.\n\nSo for m=5, no n exists such that n! has exactly 5 trailing zeros.\n\nHmm. So how to find whether any n exists for a given m.\n\nSo back to the algorithm.\n\nOnce I have the minimal n where Z(n) = m, I can then find the maximal n by finding the next n where Z(n) > m, then the maximal is previous n.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Use binary search to find the minimal n where Z(n) = m.\n\n   - If no such n exists (i.e., after binary search, Z(n) > m), output 0.\n\n- Else, find the largest n where Z(n) = m.\n\n   - Starting from the minimal n, increment until Z(n) exceeds m.\n\n- Collect all n from minimal to maximal inclusive.\n\nSo the code outline is:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute the minimal n where Z(n) == m.\n\nIf no such n exists, output 0.\n\nElse, find the maximal n where Z(n) == m.\n\nCollect all numbers from minimal to maximal, inclusive.\n\nOutput the count, followed by the numbers in order.\n\nNow, the key functions needed are:\n\n1. A function to compute Z(n), the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThis is straightforward:\n\ndef count_zero(n):\n    res = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        res +=n\n    return res\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\n2. Binary search for the minimal n.\n\nInitialize low=0, high=5*m.\n\nBut what if m is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, m >=1.\n\nWait, problem statement says 1 ≤ m ≤ 1e5.\n\nSo no need to handle m=0.\n\nSo proceed.\n\nIn the binary search:\n\nlow starts at 0, high at 5*m.\n\nLoop:\n\nwhile low <= high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n   z = count_zero(mid)\n\n   if z < m:\n\n       low = mid + 1\n\n   elif z > m:\n\n       high = mid -1\n\n   else:\n\n       low = mid\n\n       high = mid\n\nAt the end, if low is such that count_zero(low) != m, then no solution.\n\nWait, but after the binary search, if count_zero(low) == m, then it's the minimal n.\n\nElse, no solution.\n\nSo after binary search, check if count_zero(low) == m. If yes, proceed. Else, output 0.\n\nOnce the minimal n is found, find the maximal n.\n\nTo find the maximal n:\n\nstart from low, and keep checking n+1, n+2, etc., until count_zero(n) > m.\n\nThe maximal is the last n where count_zero(n) == m.\n\nBut for large m, this could take O(m) time, which may be acceptable since m is up to 1e5.\n\nWait, but for m=1e5, the maximum n could be up to say 5e5, and looping from low to high may be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, we can find the maximal n via binary search as well.\n\nLet me think: after finding the minimal n where Z(n) = m, the maximal n is the largest n where Z(n) = m.\n\nSo the condition is to find the largest n where Z(n) <= m, but wait no. Because Z(n) is non-decreasing. So for n's beyond the minimal n, Z(n) remains m until a certain point.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximal n is the minimal n' where Z(n') > m, minus one.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nFind the minimal n where Z(n) > m. Then the maximal n is (n' -1).\n\nSo how to find this n'.\n\nAgain, perform a binary search.\n\nSet low = current_min_n (the minimal n where Z(n) = m), high = current_min_n + 5*m (some high enough value).\n\nWait, perhaps setting high to current_min_n *5 or something similar.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to set high as some large value, like 5*(m+1).\n\nSo for the binary search, to find the first n where Z(n) > m.\n\nOnce found, the maximal n is that n-1.\n\nSo let's try to write the code.\n\nWait, but for the binary search to find the first n where Z(n) > m.\n\nSo the code for this binary search:\n\ndef find_first_greater(m):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * (m + 1)\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        z = count_zero(mid)\n\n        if z > m:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nWait, no, because when we find a mid where z >m, we need to look to the left for the first occurrence.\n\nWait, perhaps the standard binary search approach for the first occurrence.\n\nSo, the function returns the minimal n where Z(n) >m.\n\nThen, the maximal n where Z(n) =m is (first_greater -1).\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nSo steps in code:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute the minimal n where Z(n) == m.\n\nIf not found, print 0.\n\nElse, compute first_greater = find_first_greater(m).\n\nmaximal_n = first_greater -1.\n\nCollect all n from minimal_n to maximal_n inclusive.\n\nPrint the count and the list.\n\nNow, let's test this logic.\n\nTest case 1: m=1.\n\ncount_zero(5) = 1.\n\nBinary search for minimal n where Z(n) =1.\n\nWhat is Z(4)? 4//5=0, so 0.\n\nSo minimal n is 5.\n\nThen find first_greater for m=1.\n\nWe need to find the first n where Z(n) >1.\n\nLooking for n where Z(n) >1.\n\nLet's compute Z(5) =1, Z(6)=1, Z(7)=1, Z(8)=1, Z(9)=1, Z(10)=2.\n\nSo first_greater is 10.\n\nmaximal_n=10-1=9.\n\nSo the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: m=5.\n\nWhat is Z(25)?\n\n25//5=5, 25//25=1, total 6.\n\nSo for m=5, what is the minimal n?\n\nWe need to find n where Z(n)=5.\n\nLet's see:\n\nAt n=20: Z(20) =4+0=4.\n\nn=21: same as 20.\n\nn=22: same.\n\nn=23: same.\n\nn=24: same.\n\nn=25: Z=5+1=6>5.\n\nWait, but wait: 20//5=4, 20//25=0. So Z(20)=4.\n\nn=24: same as 20.\n\nn=25: 5+1=6.\n\nSo for m=5, there is no n where Z(n)=5.\n\nBecause the next n after 24 is 25, which gives 6.\n\nSo for m=5, the binary search would find that the minimal n where Z(n)>=5 is 25, but Z(25)=6>5, so no solution.\n\nThus, output 0.\n\nAnother test case: m=2.\n\nWhat is the minimal n where Z(n)=2.\n\nLet's compute Z(10)=2+0=2.\n\nSo minimal n is 10.\n\nFirst_greater is the first n where Z(n)>2. Let's see:\n\nn=10: 2.\n\nn=11: 2.\n\n...\n\nn=14: 2.\n\nn=15: 15//5=3, 15//25=0. So Z=3>2.\n\nSo first_greater is 15.\n\nmaximal_n is 14.\n\nSo the numbers are 10,11,12,13,14 → 5 numbers.\n\nThus, for m=2, output is 5 followed by those numbers.\n\nSo the logic seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is a single integer m. So:\n\nm = int(input().strip())\n\nThen, write the count_zero function.\n\ndef count_zero(n):\n\n    res =0\n\n    while n>0:\n\n        n = n//5\n\n        res +=n\n\n    return res\n\nThen, find the minimal n where Z(n) ==m.\n\nImplement the binary search.\n\nlow=0\n\nhigh=5*m\n\nfound = False\n\nmin_n = None\n\nwhile low <= high:\n\n    mid = (low + high)//2\n\n    z = count_zero(mid)\n\n    if z < m:\n\n        low = mid +1\n\n    elif z > m:\n\n        high = mid -1\n\n    else:\n\n        # z == m\n\n        min_n = mid\n\n        # Try to find the smallest possible\n\n        high = mid -1\n\n        # But wait, after this, we might miss a smaller mid.\n\n        # So perhaps, after setting min_n, continue searching for a lower mid.\n\n        # Or, after the loop, check if min_n is correctly set.\n\n        # Maybe it's better to collect all possibilities.\n\n        # Alternatively, after the loop, check if min_n is correct.\n\n        # Because in the loop, we only set min_n when z == m.\n\n        # So after the loop, if min_n is None, no solution.\n\n        pass\n\nAfter the loop, check if min_n is not None and count_zero(min_n) == m.\n\nIf not, output 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nWait, but perhaps the code should be written as:\n\nlow =0\n\nhigh =5*m\n\nmin_n = None\n\nwhile low <= high:\n\n    mid = (low + high)//2\n\n    z = count_zero(mid)\n\n    if z < m:\n\n        low = mid +1\n\n    elif z > m:\n\n        high = mid -1\n\n    else:\n\n        # z == m\n\n        min_n = mid\n\n        # Try to find the smallest possible.\n\n        high = mid -1\n\n# After loop:\n\nif min_n is not None and count_zero(min_n) == m:\n\n    # proceed\n\nelse:\n\n    print(0)\n\nBut wait, perhaps the code needs to adjust the high to find the minimal n.\n\nWait, perhaps the binary search isn't handling the case where multiple mid points have z == m.\n\nIn any case, after the binary search, the min_n is the smallest n where Z(n) =m.\n\nIf no such n exists, output 0.\n\nElse, find the maximal n.\n\nTo find the maximal n, we can perform a binary search for the first n where Z(n) >m.\n\nWait, but in code, perhaps writing a helper function to find the first n where Z(n) > m.\n\nSo:\n\ndef find_first_greater(m):\n\n    low =0\n\n    high =5*(m +1)\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        z = count_zero(mid)\n\n        if z > m:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nSo first_greater = find_first_greater(m)\n\nmaximal_n = first_greater -1\n\nNow, if maximal_n < min_n, then no solution.\n\nWait, but since min_n is the smallest n where Z(n) =m, and first_greater is the smallest n where Z(n) >m, then maximal_n = first_greater -1 must be >= min_n.\n\nSo, the list is from min_n to maximal_n inclusive.\n\nSo the numbers are min_n, min_n+1, ..., maximal_n.\n\nThe count is (maximal_n - min_n +1).\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif min_n is None:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    first_greater = find_first_greater(m)\n\n    if first_greater ==0:\n\n        # No n found.\n\n        print(0)\n\n    else:\n\n        maximal_n = first_greater -1\n\n        # Check if maxima >= min_n.\n\n        if maximal_n < min_n:\n\n            # Impossible, but shouldn't happen.\n\n            print(0)\n\n        else:\n\n            count = maximal_n - min_n +1\n\n            print(count)\n\n            print(' '.join(map(str, range(min_n, maximal_n +1))))\n\nWait, but in cases where min_n is not found, like m=5, then first_greater would be 25, but Z(25)=6>5. So minimal_n is None, so output 0.\n\nAnother thing: for some m, the minimal n may be such that Z(n) =m, but there is no n where Z(n) =m. Wait, no, because the binary search for minimal n finds it.\n\nWait, no: for example, m=5, the binary search for minimal n would have high=25, mid= (0+25)/2=12, z=2<5, so low=13.\n\nmid= (13+25)/2=19, z=3<5 → low=20.\n\nmid= (20+25)/2=22.5→22. z=4<5 → low=23.\n\nmid= (23+25)/2=24 → z=4<5 → low=25.\n\nNow, mid=25: z=6>5 → high=24.\n\nLoop ends, low=25>high=24.\n\nCheck if min_n is not None and Z(min_n) ==m. Since min_n is None, output 0.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nAnother test case: m=2.\n\nAs discussed, min_n=10, first_greater=15, maximal_n=14.\n\nSo the code should output 5 and the numbers 10-14.\n\nNow, what about m=6.\n\nCompute Z(25) =5+1=6.\n\nSo min_n is 25.\n\nThen find first_greater: find first n where Z(n) >6.\n\nZ(26) =5+1=6.\n\nZ(30)=6 +1=7.\n\nWait, no: 30//5=6, 30//25=1 → total 7.\n\nSo first_greater is 30.\n\nmaximal_n=29.\n\nSo the numbers are 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nCount is 5.\n\nSo the code should output 5 followed by 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nCase where m=0: but according to the problem statement, m >=1.\n\nCase where m=1.\n\nAnother case: m=3.\n\nCompute Z(14): 14//5=2, 14//25=0 → total 2.\n\nZ(15)=3.\n\nSo min_n=15.\n\nThen find first_greater: Z(15)=3, Z(16)=3, etc., until Z(20)=4.\n\nSo first_greater is 20.\n\nmaximal_n=19.\n\nSo the numbers are 15,16,17,18,19 → 5 numbers.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nNow, let's think about the code in Python.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The initial binary search for min_n might not find it if the high is too low.\n\nBut in the code, high is set to 5*m, which for m=1e5 is 5e5. Which is manageable.\n\nAnother issue: the function count_zero is efficient enough. For 5e5, it's log base 5 steps, which is 5 steps per count_zero. So for binary search steps (log 5e5 is about 19 steps), it's manageable.\n\nThus, the code should be efficient.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nRead m.\n\nCheck if m=0 → output 0 (but according to problem, m>=1, so not needed).\n\nCompute min_n via binary search.\n\nIf no min_n found, output 0.\n\nElse, compute first_greater.\n\nIf first_greater is 0 → output 0.\n\nElse, maximal_n = first_greater -1.\n\nCollect the numbers.\n\nNow, code:\n\ndef count_zero(n):\n    res = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        res +=n\n    return res\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low =0\n    high=5*m\n    min_n = None\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        z = count_zero(mid)\n        if z < m:\n            low = mid +1\n        elif z > m:\n            high = mid -1\n        else:\n            min_n = mid\n            high = mid -1\n    return min_n\n\ndef find_first_greater(m):\n    low =0\n    high=5*(m +1)\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        z = count_zero(mid)\n        if z > m:\n            high = mid -1\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input().strip())\n\nmin_n = find_min_n(m)\nif min_n is None:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    first_greater = find_first_greater(m)\n    if first_greater ==0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        maximal_n = first_greater -1\n        if maximal_n < min_n:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            count = maximal_n - min_n +1\n            print(count)\n            print(' '.join(map(str, range(min_n, maximal_n +1))))\n            print()\n\nWait, but in the code, after printing the count and the list, we have an extra print(), which is not correct.\n\nWait, looking at the sample output, the first case is printed as \"5\\n5 6 7 8 9\", which is the count followed by the list.\n\nSo, the code should print the count, then a new line, then the list separated by spaces, then a new line.\n\nWait, the sample output shows:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nSo, for the first case, the output is a string that starts with '5\\n', then the space-separated numbers, then another newline? Or perhaps the output is the count, then the numbers on the same line.\n\nWait, the sample input shows the output as two lines. Wait no, the sample output is a list of two strings. The first string is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', which seems to represent the output as 5 followed by the five numbers on the same line.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should print the count, followed by a new line, then the numbers separated by spaces and a new line.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nprint(count)\nprint(' '.join(map(str, range(min_n, maximal_n+1)))\n\nWhich would produce:\n\n5\n\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nBut in the sample, it's shown as a single string '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. So perhaps the code should output the count and the list on the same line.\n\nWait, no: the sample output shows the first case as having an output of '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', which suggests that the count is printed, followed by a new line, then the numbers are printed on the same line.\n\nWait, perhaps in the problem statement, the output is that the first line is k, the second line is the k numbers.\n\nSo, in the sample, the first case's output is:\n\n5\n\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo the code should print the count on the first line, then the numbers on the second line.\n\nSo, in the code, after computing the count and the list, the code should print the count, then print the list as space-separated numbers.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nprint(count)\nprint(' '.join(map(str, range(min_n, maximal_n +1))))\n\nBut when testing, perhaps the judge expects the output as a single line with the count, followed by the numbers, but I'm not sure.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe output should first print k, then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\nSo, the output is two lines: the first is k, the second is the numbers separated by spaces.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut in the code above, after the else clause, the code prints count, then the list, then another print().\n\nWhich would cause an empty line. That's incorrect.\n\nSo, in the code, the last print() is wrong.\n\nSo the corrected code is:\n\nif min_n is None:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    first_greater = find_first_greater(m)\n\n    if first_greater ==0:\n\n        print(0)\n\n    else:\n\n        maximal_n = first_greater -1\n\n        if maximal_n < min_n:\n\n            print(0)\n\n        else:\n\n            count = maximal_n - min_n +1\n\n            print(count)\n\n            print(' '.join(map(str, range(min_n, maximal_n +1))))\n\nSo, in the code, the print statements are fixed.\n\nTesting this code with m=1 should output:\n\n1\n\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=5.\n\nNo solution, so output 0.\n\nSo the code should print 0.\n\nNow, code-wise, all looks correct.\n\nNow, let's see about the helper functions.\n\nWait, what about when m is such that the minimal n is 0?\n\nWell, for m=0, but according to the problem, m is at least 1.\n\nThus, no problem.\n\nAnother case: m=6.\n\nAs earlier, min_n=25.\n\nFirst_greater is 30.\n\nmaximal_n=29.\n\nSo the code should output 5 followed by 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nThus, correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, considering that for m=1e5, the code will perform binary searches and count_zero efficiently.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. The solution involves efficiently finding these integers using binary search and understanding the properties of trailing zeros in factorials.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) (factorial of \\( n \\)) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are always more multiples of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the count of 5s in the prime factors of \\( n! \\). This can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until the division yields zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Minimal \\( n \\)**: Use binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) = m \\). If no such \\( n \\) exists, output 0.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Maximal \\( n \\)**: After finding the minimal \\( n \\), find the first \\( n \\) where \\( Z(n) > m \\). The largest \\( n \\) with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros will be one less than this value.\n\n4. **Output the Results**: Once the range of valid \\( n \\) values is determined, output the count of these values followed by the values themselves.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zero(n):\n    res = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        res += n\n    return res\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    min_n = None\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_zero(mid)\n        if z < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        elif z > m:\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            min_n = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n    return min_n\n\ndef find_first_greater(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * (m + 1)\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_zero(mid)\n        if z > m:\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input().strip())\n\nmin_n = find_min_n(m)\nif min_n is None:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    first_greater = find_first_greater(m)\n    if first_greater == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        maximal_n = first_greater - 1\n        if maximal_n < min_n:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            count = maximal_n - min_n + 1\n            print(count)\n            print(' '.join(map(str, range(min_n, maximal_n + 1))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **count_zero Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) by summing the contributions from multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc.\n- **find_min_n Function**: Uses binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) = m \\).\n- **find_first_greater Function**: Uses binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) where \\( Z(n) > m \\).\n- **Main Logic**: Reads input, determines the range of valid \\( n \\) values, and prints the results accordingly.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, ensuring the solution is both optimal and scalable for large values of \\( m \\).",
