You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to maximize the value of a given integer 'a' by replacing some of its digits with digits from a sequence 's'. Each digit in 's' can be used at most once for replacement. Hmm.\n\nLet me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. So, I'm given two strings: a and s. The string a represents the number, and s is a sequence of digits. For each digit in s, I can choose any position in a to replace one of its digits with that digit, but each digit from s can only be used once. My goal is to perform these replacements such that the resulting number is as large as possible.\n\nWait, right. So the key is to replace the earliest possible digit in 'a' with the largest possible available digit from 's' that's larger than the current digit. But I also need to consider which digits to use from 's' to maximize the overall number.\n\nFirst, let's think about how to approach this. I think the optimal strategy would be to iterate through each digit of 'a' from left to right. For each position, if there's a digit in 's' that's larger than the current digit, we should replace it with the largest possible such digit. Then, we move on to the next position and repeat the process with the remaining digits in 's'.\n\nBut wait, maybe not just the largest possible. Because sometimes, using a slightly smaller digit early on might allow us to use larger digits later. Or perhaps not—since earlier digits have higher significance. So, the optimal approach is to always pick the largest possible digit from 's' that's larger than the current digit in 'a' at the earliest position possible.\n\nSo, here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Convert both 'a' and 's' into lists of characters (digits) so that we can manipulate them.\n2. Sort the 's' list in descending order so that we can pick the largest available digit first.\n3. Iterate through each digit of 'a' from left to right:\n   a. For the current position, check if there are any digits left in 's' that are larger than the current digit.\n   b. If yes, replace the current digit with the largest possible digit from 's' that's bigger. Then, remove that digit from 's' (since each can be used only once).\n   c. If no such digit exists, move to the next position.\n4. Once all possible replacements are done, output the modified 'a' as the result.\n\nWait, but after sorting 's' in descending order, for each position, I can check if any digit in 's' is larger than 'a's current digit. The first such digit (largest possible) should be used to replace it. That way, we maximize the leftmost possible digits, which contributes more to the overall number's value.\n\nLet me think about an example. Suppose a is \"1024\" and s is \"010\". So s sorted in descending order is ['1', '0', '0'].\n\nProcessing each digit:\n\n- First digit is '1'. Looking at s, the largest digit is '1' which is equal. Since it's not larger, we don't replace it. So move to next position.\n- Second digit is '0'. The largest in s is '1' which is larger. Replace it. Now, a becomes \"1124\", and s is now ['0', '0'].\n- Third digit is '2'. The remaining s has 0s, which are smaller. No replacement.\n- Fourth digit is '4'. Same, no replacement.\n\nSo the result is \"1124\", which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: if a is \"987\" and s is \"1234567\". Wait, no, the sample input was different. Oh wait, in the sample input, the second line is '987\\n1234567', but in the output, '987' remains because s is '1234567' which are all smaller than the digits in a except maybe 7. Let's see:\n\nWait, a is \"987\". s is \"1234567\". So sorted s is ['7', '6', '5', '4', '3', '2', '1'].\n\nNow, processing a's digits:\n\nFirst digit is '9'. Look for the largest in s which is '7'. Since 7 <9, no replacement. So move to next digit.\nSecond digit is '8'. Largest in s is '7' still. 7 <8, so no replacement.\nThird digit is '7'. Now, the largest in s is '7' which is equal. So no replacement.\nSo no changes. Output is 987.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: a is \"0\". Well, according to the problem statement, a doesn't have",

Each digit in 's' can be used at most once for replacement. The goal is to perform these replacements such that the resulting number is as large as possible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Inputs**: Convert both the integer 'a' and the sequence 's' into lists of characters (digits) for easy manipulation.\n2. **Sort the Sequence**: Sort the sequence 's' in descending order so that we can access the largest available digit first.\n3. **Iterate Through Digits**: Iterate through each digit of 'a' from left to right:\n   - For each position, check if there are any remaining digits in 's' that are larger than the current digit in 'a'.\n   - If such a digit exists, replace the current digit with the largest possible digit from 's' and remove that digit from 's'.\n4. **Construct Result**: After processing all possible replacements, construct the resulting number from the modified list of digits of 'a'.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the value of 'a' by using the largest possible digits from 's' at the earliest positions, which have the highest significance.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na = input().strip()\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Convert a into a list of characters for easy manipulation\na_list = list(a)\ns_list = list(s)\n\n# Sort s in descending order to pick the largest possible digit first\ns_list.sort(reverse=True)\n\nfor i in range(len(a_list)):\n    # Current digit to compare\n    current_digit = a_list[i]\n    # Check if there's a digit in s that is larger than current_digit\n    for j in range(len(s_list)):\n        if s_list[j] > current_digit:\n            # Replace and break out of loops\n            a_list[i] = s_list[j]\n            del s_list[j]\n            break\n    else:\n        # No replacement possible, continue to next digit\n        continue\n\nprint(''.join(a_list))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Conversion and Sorting**: The integer 'a' is converted into a list of characters to facilitate digit replacement. The sequence 's' is sorted in descending order to easily access the largest available digit.\n- **Digit Replacement**: For each digit in 'a', starting from the left, we check if there is a digit in 's' that is larger. If found, we replace the current digit with this larger digit and remove it from 's'. This ensures that we maximize the value of 'a' by making the highest possible changes early on.\n- **Efficiency**: This approach efficiently processes each digit of 'a' and each digit of 's' in linear time relative to their lengths, ensuring optimal performance even for the maximum constraints.",
