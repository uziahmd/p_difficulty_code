Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. Hmm, let me think about the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, what defines an 'X' in this context? Oh right, the diagonals must all be the same character, and all other squares (not on the diagonals) must be the same different character. Also, the diagonals should form an X shape, which means their intersection is at the center.\n\nSo the plan is: for each test case, check two main conditions.\n\nCondition 1: Both diagonals are composed of the same character. So the top-left to bottom-right diagonal and the top-right to bottom-left diagonal must have the same character. Let's call this character 'diag_char'.\n\nCondition 2: All the non-diagonal squares must be the same character, which is different from 'diag_char'. Let's call this 'other_char'.\n\nAdditionally, the grid size n must be odd, which it always is according to the input constraints.\n\nWait, but how do I find the diagonals? Let's see: for a grid of size n x n, the main diagonal runs from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1), and the anti-diagonal runs from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0).\n\nSo I'll need to iterate through each cell in the grid and check if it's on either of these diagonals.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the input: first n, then n lines each containing n characters.\n2. For each cell (i,j), determine if it's on the main diagonal (i == j) or the anti-diagonal (i + j == n-1).\n3. Collect all the characters on both diagonals. If these two sets don't have the same characters, then the condition 1 fails.\n4. Once condition 1 is satisfied, collect all the non-diagonal characters. They must all be the same, and different from the diagonal character.\n5. If both conditions are met, output \"YES\"; else, \"NO\".\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: The grid is 3x3. For example, the second sample input has a 3x3 grid where both diagonals are 's', and the others are 'w's except maybe the center? Wait no, wait the second sample's output is YES. Let me check the input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nWait, wait, the first line is 'wsw', so the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\nRow 1: s w s\nRow 2: w s w\n\nSo the main diagonal is w, s, w. The anti-diagonal is w, w, w. So the diagonals have different characters, so condition 1 fails. Hmm, but according to the sample output, the second input gives \"YES\". Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the sample.\n\nWait, no. Looking back, the sample input is:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nWait the second input is 3 lines. Let me parse them correctly.\n\nWait, each line is n=3, so each row is 3 characters.\n\nLine 1: 'wsw' → row 0: w s w\nLine 2: 'sws' → row 1: s w s\nLine 3: 'wsw' → row 2: w s w\n\nSo the main diagonal is row 0[0], row 1[1], row 2[2] → w, w, w. So diag_char is 'w'.\n\nAnti-diagonal is row 0[2], row 1[1], row 2[0] → w, w, w. So both diagonals are same. Now, the other cells: for example, (0,1) is 's', (1,0) is 's', etc. Are all non-diagonal cells 's'? Yes. So condition 2 is met. So output is YES.\n\nAnother edge case: when n is 1? But according to input, n is at least 3.\n\nAnother case: when the diagonals have varying characters. Like, in a 5x5 grid, the main diagonal is x, o, x, o, x. Then the anti-diagonal is o, x, o, x, o. These are different, so condition 1 fails.\n\nAnother case: the non-diagonal cells have multiple different characters. For example, some are 'a's and others are 'b's. Then condition 2 fails.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. The grid must have both diagonals composed of the same character, and all other cells must be the same different character.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the integer `n` which specifies the size of the grid, followed by reading the grid itself.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: Identify the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left). Ensure both diagonals consist of the same character.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: Verify that all cells not on the diagonals contain the same character, which must be different from the diagonal character.\n4. **Result Determination**: If both conditions are satisfied, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Function to check if a cell is on the main or anti-diagonal\ndef is_diagonal(i, j):\n    return i == j or i + j == n - 1\n\ndiag_char = None\nother_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if is_diagonal(i, j):\n            if diag_char is None:\n                diag_char = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if diag_char != grid[i][j]:\n                    # Diagonals don't have the same character\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit()\n        else:\n            other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(set(other_chars)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Check if the other character is different from diag_char\n    if set(other_chars) == {diag_char}:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The grid dimensions and contents are read from standard input.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: For each cell in the grid, we check if it lies on either of the two diagonals. If any cell on the diagonals does not match the expected diagonal character, the result is immediately \"NO\".\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: Collect all characters not on the diagonals. If these characters are not all the same and different from the diagonal character, the result is \"NO\".\n4. **Output Result**: Based on the checks, the appropriate result (\"YES\" or \"NO\") is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check the necessary conditions with a time complexity of O(n^2), which is optimal for the given constraints.",
