They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if it's possible to assign numbers to lawns such that all the given edges' GCD and LCM conditions are satisfied. And if it is possible, output any one of the valid assignments.\n\nHmm, let me read the problem statement again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe input gives me n lawns and m known roads. Each road connects two lawns and has a GCD and LCM pair. My task is to assign each lawn a number such that for every known road, the GCD of the two numbers is equal to the given GCD and the LCM is equal to the given LCM. If it's not possible, I should output NO. Otherwise, output YES and the assigned numbers.\n\nSo, the approach here is to model this as a system of equations and constraints. For each edge, the two nodes u and v must satisfy:\n\nGCD(a_u, a_v) = g\nLCM(a_u, a_v) = l\n\nWhere a_u is the number assigned to node u.\n\nI remember that for two numbers x and y, GCD(x, y) * LCM(x, y) = x * y. So, for each edge, we can say that a_u * a_v = g * l.\n\nThat's a crucial relation. So for each edge, the product of the two node values is fixed as g * l.\n\nWait, but then also, the GCD of the two must be exactly g. How does that affect the possible values?\n\nLet me think: suppose a_u and a_v are such that their GCD is g, and LCM is l. Then, since GCD(a_u, a_v) = g, we can write a_u = g * a, a_v = g * b, where a and b are coprime (their GCD is 1). Then, the LCM would be g * a * b, which equals l. So, a * b = l / g.\n\nSo, for each edge, the product a_u * a_v is g*l, and a and b are coprimes whose product is l/g.\n\nTherefore, for each edge, the product of the two node values is g*l, and the two node values must be multiples of g, such that when divided by g, they are coprime.\n\nSo, how do I model this?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled using a graph where each node's value is a multiple of some base variable, and the edges impose constraints on the possible multiples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this with variables in a way that each node's value is expressed in terms of another node, perhaps through a spanning tree.\n\nBut wait, the problem might not form a connected graph. So I need to handle that.\n\nWait, but the initial map may have multiple components. So for each connected component, I can assign values independently. Because the constraints between nodes in different components don't affect each other.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each connected component in the graph, process it separately.\n2. For each component, assign values to the nodes such that all the edges' constraints are satisfied.\n3. If any component cannot be processed (i.e., no solution exists for it), the overall answer is NO.\n4. Otherwise, assign values and output.\n\nSo, the first step is to find all connected components. Then, for each component, solve the system of equations.\n\nNow, how to model each component.\n\nEach edge in the component imposes a constraint on two nodes. The variables are the a_i's, the numbers assigned to the nodes.\n\nWe can model this as a system of equations where for each edge, a_u * a_v = g * l.\n\nBut also, the GCD condition implies that a_u and a_v must be multiples of g, and after division by g, their GCD is 1.\n\nWait, because:\n\na_u = g * x, a_v = g * y.\n\nThen, GCD(a_u, a_v) = g * GCD(x, y).\n\nSince GCD(a_u, a_v) must be g, GCD(x, y) must be 1.\n\nAlso, LCM(a_u, a_v) = (g x y) / GCD(x, y) = g x y, since x and y are coprimes.\n\nWhich must equal l.\n\nSo, l = g * x * y → x * y = l / g.\n\nSo, for each edge, x and y are coprimes, and x*y = (l/g).\n\nSo, for each edge, the product of x and y is known, and x and y must be coprimes.\n\nHmm, but how do we model this? Because the x's and y's are dependent on each other.\n\nWait, perhaps we can represent each node as a variable that is a multiple of a certain value, and the edges define the product constraints.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model this as a system of equations where for each edge (u, v), a_u * a_v = k, where k is g * l.\n\nBut then, the additional constraints are that the GCD of a_u and a_v is g.\n\nWait, but earlier analysis shows that a_u = g * x and a_v = g * y, with x and y coprimes, and x*y = (l/g).\n\nSo, the product a_u * a_v is g^2 x y = g * l → g x y = l → x y = l/g.\n\nSo, for each edge, we have x * y = (l/g), and x and y are coprimes.\n\nSo, for each edge, the product of x and y is fixed, and x and y are coprimes.\n\nThis suggests that for each edge, the possible pairs (x, y) are factor pairs of (l/g) that are coprimes.\n\nSo, for each edge, we can precompute all possible (x, y) pairs.\n\nBut with multiple edges, how do these pairs constrain the variables?\n\nWait, but if the edges form a system where each variable is connected through equations, perhaps we can model this with a Union-Find structure or a system of equations.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the variables x for each node must be such that for each edge (u, v), x_u * x_v = t, where t is (l/g) for that edge.\n\nWait, but t varies per edge, right? Because each edge has its own g and l.\n\nWait, no. Wait, each edge has its own g and l. So for each edge (u, v), a_u * a_v = g * l → (a_u / g) * (a_v / g) = l/g.\n\nSo, the product of x and y is (l/g), where x = a_u / g, y = a_v / g.\n\nSo, for each edge, x * y = (l/g), and x and y are coprimes.\n\nSo, for each edge, the pair (x, y) must be such that x * y = s, where s = l/g, and x and y are coprimes.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding x variables for each node such that for every edge, x_u * x_v = s_uv, where s_uv is l/g for that edge.\n\nAnd x_u and x_v must be coprimes for each edge.\n\nWait, but in the edge (u, v), the s_uv is l/g, and x_u * x_v must equal s_uv.\n\nBut what about the case where s_uv is zero? No, the problem says the initial numbers on the roads were at least 1, so s_uv = (l/g) ≥ 1.\n\nWait, because l is the LCM, which is ≥ g (since g is GCD ≤ LCM). So s_uv is ≥ 1.\n\nSo, now, for each edge, x_u * x_v = s_uv, and x_u and x_v are coprimes.\n\nThis seems similar to a system where variables are connected via multiplicative constraints.\n\nSo, how can we model this? It's a system of multiplicative constraints.\n\nBut solving such a system could be tricky.\n\nAnother thought: since x variables are coprimes for each edge, perhaps we can model them as primes, but that's probably not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the variables can be represented in terms of their prime factors. But that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the variables as a tree, assigning values based on the constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a system where each connected component is a tree, and we can perform a BFS or DFS, assigning x values to each node, ensuring that for each edge, the product is s and the variables are coprimes.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think about a simple example.\n\nSuppose we have three nodes: A, B, C.\n\nEdge AB: s=6, so x_A * x_B=6, and x_A and x_B are coprimes.\n\nEdge BC: s=8, x_B * x_C=8, x_B and x_C are coprimes.\n\nWhat's the possible assignment?\n\nFor AB: possible pairs are (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). But since x_A and x_B must be coprimes.\n\nSimilarly for BC.\n\nSo, let's say for AB, x_A=2, x_B=3.\n\nThen for BC, x_B=3 and x_C must be such that 3*x_C=8. But 8 is not divisible by 3. So that's impossible.\n\nThus, perhaps the only way is if x_B is 1, but then for AB, x_A=6. Then, for BC, x_C=8.\n\nCheck: x_A=6, x_B=1, x_C=8.\n\nAB: 6*1=6, correct. Are 6 and 1 coprimes? Yes.\n\nBC: 1*8=8, correct. Coprimes? Yes.\n\nSo that works.\n\nSo the assignment is possible.\n\nAnother example: suppose a triangle where each edge has s=4.\n\nSo, for AB: x_A * x_B=4, coprimes.\n\nPossible options: (1,4) or (4,1), or (2,2) but 2 and 2 are not coprimes.\n\nSo, let's pick x_A=1, x_B=4.\n\nThen, for AC: x_A * x_C=4 → x_C=4.\n\nBut then, for BC: x_B * x_C=4 *4=16, which is not equal to s=4. So invalid.\n\nAlternatively, for AB, pick x_A=4, x_B=1.\n\nThen AC: x_C=1.\n\nThen BC: x_B=1, x_C=1 → product is 1, not 4. Invalid.\n\nAnother option: AB could be x_A=2, x_B=2, but they are not coprimes. So no.\n\nThus, no solution.\n\nSo the conclusion is that sometimes, even if each edge individually allows solutions, the combination might not.\n\nHence, the problem requires us to model the constraints across all edges and find a consistent assignment.\n\nSo, the approach is to model the problem as a system of equations where each equation is x_u * x_v = s_uv, and x_u and x_v are coprimes.\n\nNow, how can we model this system and find a solution?\n\nOne approach is to model this as a graph where each node has a value x, and edges impose constraints on pairs of nodes.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps, for each connected component, we can choose a root and assign x values relative to the root.\n\nWait, that's a promising idea.\n\nLet's consider choosing a root node, say node r.\n\nWe can assign x_r = 1, then proceed to assign x for other nodes based on the edges.\n\nBut then, for each edge (u, v), x_u * x_v = s_uv. So, for node u and v, if u is the parent of v, then x_v = s_uv / x_u.\n\nBut this approach only works if the edges form a tree, or if cycles are handled correctly.\n\nWait, but if the component has cycles, then the constraints must be consistent around the cycle.\n\nSo, for example, in a cycle u → v → w → u, each edge imposes an equation:\n\nx_u * x_v = s_uv\n\nx_v * x_w = s_vw\n\nx_w * x_u = s_wu\n\nIf substituting, we get:\n\nx_u * x_v = s_uv\n\nx_v = s_vw / x_w\n\nSubstituting into first equation: x_u * (s_vw / x_w) = s_uv → x_u * x_w = s_uv * x_w / x_v ... Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to see is that along any cycle, the product of the edge constraints must multiply to 1.\n\nBecause for a cycle u-v-w-u:\n\nx_u * x_v = s_uv → (1)\n\nx_v * x_w = s_vw → (2)\n\nx_w * x_u = s_wu → (3)\n\nMultiply all three equations: (x_u x_v)(x_v x_w)(x_w x_u) ) = s_uv * s_vw * s_wu\n\nLeft side is x_u² x_v² x_w² → (x_u x_v x_w)^2.\n\nRight side is product of s's.\n\nSo, (x_u x_v x_w)^2 = s_uv * s_vw * s_wu.\n\nTaking square roots, x_u x_v x_w = sqrt(s_uv * s_vw * s_wu) or negative, but since x's are positive integers, we can ignore negative.\n\nBut for the product to be consistent, the product of s's must be a perfect square.\n\nOtherwise, no solution.\n\nSo, in general, for any cycle in the component, the product of the s's along the cycle must be a perfect square. Otherwise, no solution.\n\nThus, during processing, for each connected component, we must check for cycles and ensure that the product of s's around any cycle is a perfect square.\n\nIf any component has a cycle that doesn't satisfy this, output NO.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n1. Check if it's a tree (no cycles). If it's a tree, process the edges to assign x values.\n\n2. If it has cycles, check if for every cycle, the product of the s's (l/g for the edges in the cycle) is a perfect square. If any cycle fails this, output NO.\n\n3. If all cycles are okay, process the component by choosing a root and assigning x values accordingly.\n\nBut wait, how to process the component after checking the cycles.\n\nOnce we know that all cycles are valid, we can proceed to assign x values.\n\nWe can choose a root (like node 1), and assign x_root = 1.\n\nThen, for each edge, starting from the root, assign x_v = s_uv / x_u.\n\nBut we need to make sure that x_v is an integer and that for each edge, x_u and x_v are coprimes.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nBecause each edge (u, v) requires that x_u and x_v are coprimes, and their product is s_uv.\n\nSo, during the assignment, for each edge, once x_u is determined, x_v must be s_uv divided by x_u, and this must result in an integer. Additionally, x_u and x_v must be coprimes.\n\nSo, in the BFS/DFS approach, when we assign x_v based on x_u, we must ensure that x_u divides s_uv, and that x_v is coprime with x_u.\n\nBut wait, how can that be guaranteed? Because x_u and x_v must be coprimes.\n\nWait, perhaps during the traversal, when processing an edge, we have x_u and must compute x_v as s_uv / x_u. We can check if s_uv is divisible by x_u. If not, it's impossible.\n\nAlso, x_v and x_u must be coprimes. Since x_v = s_uv / x_u, and x_u and x_v must be coprimes.\n\nBut since x_u and x_v are coprimes, it's necessary that x_u divides s_uv, and that the quotient x_v is coprime with x_u.\n\nSo, during the assignment, we must verify both conditions.\n\nBut how can we model this in code?\n\nPerhaps, for each edge (u, v), during BFS:\n\n- When visiting u, for each neighbor v that hasn't been visited yet, we can compute x_v as s_uv / x_u.\n\n- We must check that x_v is an integer, i.e., s_uv mod x_u == 0.\n\n- Also, x_v and x_u must be coprimes.\n\nIf any of these checks fail, the component has no solution.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nBut what about if v has already been visited? That means there's a cycle.\n\nIn that case, we must check whether the current assignment of x_v is consistent with the previously assigned x_v.\n\nHow?\n\nBecause in the component, we've already processed some edges and assigned x values.\n\nWhen we hit a back edge (v has been visited), we need to check whether the x_v computed via this edge is equal to the existing x_v.\n\nIf not, the constraints are inconsistent, and the component has no solution.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n- Choose a root node, assign x_root = 1.\n\n- Perform a BFS or DFS, assigning x values to adjacent nodes.\n\n- For each edge, when moving from u to v (unvisited), assign x_v = s_uv / x_u, check divisibility and coprimality.\n\n- For each edge, when moving from u to v (already visited), check if the computed x_v equals the existing x_v. Also, check that x_u * x_v equals s_uv.\n\nWait, but if the edge is processed as part of a back edge, then the product x_u * x_v must equal s_uv. But since x_v was already assigned, we need to confirm that this holds.\n\nSo, during the BFS/DFS, when we reach a node v via a new edge, we compute x_v and compare it to the existing x_v (if any). If they differ, it's a conflict.\n\nIf everything is consistent, continue; else, mark the component as invalid.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. For each connected component:\n\n   a. Check if it has any cycles. How? Well, during BFS, if we encounter a back edge, we can note that a cycle exists.\n\n   b. For each cycle found in the component, compute the product of s's along the cycle. If it's not a perfect square, the component is invalid.\n\n   c. Once all cycles are checked and found to have products that are perfect squares, proceed to assign x values.\n\n2. Assign x values:\n\n   a. Choose a root node (say, the first node in the component).\n\n   b. Assign x[root] = 1.\n\n   c. Use BFS or DFS to assign x values to all nodes reachable from the root.\n\n   d. For each edge in the component:\n\n      i. If it's part of a tree (parent-child relationship), assign x_child = s / x_parent, ensuring s is divisible by x_parent and x_parent and x_child are coprimes.\n\n      ii. If it's a back edge, check if x_parent * x_child equals s. If not, conflict.\n\n3. After processing all components, if any component is invalid, output NO.\n\n4. Else, compute the a_i's for each node as g * x_i, where g is the GCD of the edge's GCD value.\n\nWait, no. Because for each edge, the GCD is given as g, so a_u = g * x_u and a_v = g * x_v.\n\nYes, because x_u is (a_u)/g, and x_v is (a_v)/g.\n\nSo, once x values are assigned, a_i = g_i * x_i, where g_i is the GCD of the edge(s) connected to node i.\n\nWait, no. Because for each node, the GCD is determined by all edges connected to it. But for a node with multiple edges, all edges must agree on the same GCD.\n\nWait, that's a key point.\n\nEach node's a_i is fixed, so all edges incident to it must have the same GCD.\n\nWait, that's a problem because the initial problem may have edges with different GCDs for the same node.\n\nSo, for example, if node u has two edges: one with GCD g1, another with GCD g2, then a_u must satisfy that GCD(a_u, a_v) = g1 and also GCD(a_u, a_w) = g2.\n\nWhich implies that g1 must divide a_u and g2 must divide a_u.\n\nSo, unless g1 and g2 are compatible (i.e., their LCM divides a_u), but this complicates things.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the initial map had edges with specific GCD and LCM. So, for the given edges, their GCD and LCM must be consistent with the a_i's.\n\nSo, for each node u, all edges incident to u must have the same GCD.\n\nWait, no. Because a node can have multiple edges, each connecting to different nodes. The GCD for each edge depends on the other node's a value.\n\nSo, it's possible for a node u to have multiple edges with different GCDs, provided that for each edge, the GCD is correct.\n\nBut wait, how?\n\nFor example, node u could have a value a_u=6.\n\nEdges:\n\nu-v: GCD is 2 → a_v is 3 (since 6 and 3 have GCD 3, not 2). Wait, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nFor an edge (u, v), a_u and a_v must satisfy GCD(a_u, a_v) = g and LCM(a_u, a_v) = l.\n\nWhich implies that a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, with x and y coprimes and x*y = l/g.\n\nSo, for each edge, the GCD is fixed as g.\n\nBut a node u can have multiple edges, each with their own g.\n\nWait, that's possible.\n\nFor example, node u could be connected to v1 with GCD 2, and to v2 with GCD 3.\n\nThen, a_u must be a multiple of both 2 and 3, so a_u must be a multiple of 6.\n\nSo, a_u = 6k.\n\nThen, for edge u-v1: a_v1 = 2m, and m must be coprime with a_u/2 = 3k.\n\nSo, m must be coprime with 3k.\n\nSimilarly, for edge u-v2: a_v2 = 3n, and n must be coprime with 2k.\n\nSo, it's possible for a node to have multiple edges with different GCDs, as long as a_u is a multiple of all those GCDs, and the other nodes' a values are set accordingly.\n\nThus, the problem allows for a node to have multiple edges with varying GCDs.\n\nBut this complicates the matter because for a node u, the a_u is determined by all edges connected to it, which must all share a common multiple.\n\nWait, but a_u must be a multiple of each edge's GCD.\n\nSo, the GCDs for the edges connected to u must all divide a_u.\n\nWhich means that a_u must be a multiple of the least common multiple of all the GCDs of edges connected to u.\n\nSo, for each node u, let's compute the LCM of all GCDs of edges connected to it. Let's call this G_u.\n\nSo, a_u must be a multiple of G_u.\n\nBut since a_u is determined by the x variables, which are related to the edges, this may impose additional constraints.\n\nWait, but in the earlier approach, for each edge (u, v), a_u is g * x_u, a_v is g * x_v.\n\nSo, for a node u with multiple edges, each edge has its own g.\n\nSo, a_u is g1 * x1, g2 * x2, etc.\n\nBut x1, x2, etc., are determined by the constraints of the edges.\n\nThus, for a_u to be consistent, all the g's must divide a_u.\n\nWhich implies that a_u must be a multiple of the LCM of all the g's connected to u.\n\nBut in the earlier approach, a_u is built as g * x_u, which is a multiple of g.\n\nBut if a_u is connected to edges with different g's, then a_u must be a multiple of each g, thus a multiple of their LCM.\n\nSo, how can this be handled?\n\nAh, perhaps in the initial setup, the g's for edges connected to a node u must be such that their LCM is a divisor of a_u.\n\nBut a_u is determined by the x variables, which are tied to the edges.\n\nSo, perhaps during the BFS/DFS assignment of x variables, for each node u, the product of the edges' g's must be considered.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nInstead of trying to model the x variables directly, perhaps model the a variables, considering that for each edge, a_u and a_v must satisfy the GCD and LCM constraints.\n\nBut how?\n\nEach edge (u, v) imposes that a_u * a_v = g * l.\n\nSo, for each edge, a_u * a_v is fixed.\n\nAdditionally, the GCD(a_u, a_v) must be g.\n\nWhich implies that a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, where x and y are coprimes, and x*y = l/g.\n\nSo, for each edge, a_u and a_v must be multiples of g, and their product after dividing by g must be x*y = l/g, with x and y coprimes.\n\nSo, for each node u, all edges connected to u must have a_u being a multiple of their g's.\n\nSo, a_u must be a multiple of the LCM of all g's for edges connected to u.\n\nBut a_u is also determined by the x variables.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\nFor each node u, collect all the g's from its edges. Compute G_u as the LCM of these g's.\n\nThen, a_u must be a multiple of G_u.\n\nBut a_u is also g_x * x, where g_x is the g for the edge from which we derived x.\n\nWait, perhaps this is too intertwined.\n\nAlternative idea: For each connected component, build a system of equations where each equation is a_u * a_v = g * l.\n\nThen, the variables are a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.\n\nBut solving such a system for n variables is impractical for n up to, say, 1e5.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input size isn't specified, but the constraints on g and l are up to 1e3. So perhaps n is manageable.\n\nBut for the sample input, n is 3, m is 4.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the input could have up to m=1e5 edges, which would require an efficient solution.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to model the problem using the x variables as before, but ensuring that for each node u, the product of x's and the edge constraints are consistent.\n\nBut I'm stuck on how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the x variables can be considered as fractions, and the problem is to find a system of equations where x_u * x_v = s_uv, with x_u and x_v coprimes.\n\nBut how to manage this.\n\nAnother approach: model the x variables as a tree, and for each node, assign x values based on the root.\n\nBut for nodes connected via multiple edges, the constraints must be consistent.\n\nSo, perhaps the process is:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n1. Check if it's bipartite in a way that all cycles have products of s's that are perfect squares. If not, return NO.\n\n2. Choose a root, assign x_root = 1.\n\n3. BFS/DFS to assign x values for all nodes in the component.\n\n4. For each edge, during assignment, check if x_u * x_v = s_uv, and x_u and x_v are coprimes.\n\n5. Also, for each node u, collect all the g's from edges connected to u, compute their LCM, and ensure that a_u is a multiple of this LCM.\n\nWait, but a_u is g_x * x, where g_x is the g for an edge. So, a_u must be a multiple of each g_x.\n\nThus, the LCM of all g_x's for edges connected to u must divide a_u.\n\nBut a_u = g_x * x, so x must be such that g_x * x is a multiple of the LCM of all g_x's.\n\nWait, but the LCM of all g_x's for u is the LCM of the GCDs of all edges connected to u.\n\nLet's denote this as G_u.\n\nSo, a_u must be a multiple of G_u.\n\nBut a_u is also equal to g_x * x, where g_x is the GCD of some edge connected to u.\n\nThus, G_u must divide g_x * x.\n\nBut since G_u is the LCM of all g_x's, which includes g_x, G_u is a multiple of g_x.\n\nSo, G_u = k * g_x, where k is an integer.\n\nThus, a_u = g_x * x must be a multiple of G_u = k * g_x → x must be a multiple of k.\n\nSo, x must be a multiple of k, which is G_u / g_x.\n\nBut x is determined by the edges, so perhaps during the BFS/DFS, we can ensure that x is a multiple of (G_u / g_x).\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each node u, calculate G_u = LCM of all g's from edges connected to u.\n\nThen, a_u must be a multiple of G_u.\n\nBut a_u is determined by the x variables as a_u = g_x * x.\n\nSo, G_u must divide g_x * x → x must be a multiple of (G_u / g_x).\n\nBut x is determined via the edges.\n\nSo, for each node u, after assigning x, we can check if G_u divides g_x * x.\n\nIf not, the component is invalid.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nThis suggests that during the BFS/DFS, after assigning x, we must compute G_u for each node u, and check that G_u divides g_x * x.\n\nBut since G_u depends on all edges connected to u, which may not have been processed yet, this could be challenging.\n\nHmm.\n\nThis seems quite involved.\n\nPerhaps, the way forward is to implement the initial approach, handling the x variables and ensuring that for each edge, the product and coprimality constraints are met.\n\nBut then, after computing x variables, compute G_u for each node u and check if a_u (which is g_x * x) is a multiple of G_u.\n\nIf not, the component is invalid.\n\nBut how to compute G_u for each node.\n\nG_u is the LCM of all g's from edges connected to u.\n\nSo, for each node u, during the processing of the component, collect all the g's of its edges.\n\nCompute G_u as their LCM.\n\nThen, check if G_u divides a_u = g_x * x.\n\nIf yes, proceed; else, invalid.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n1. Check for cycles, ensuring that for each cycle, the product of s's is a perfect square.\n\n2. Assign x variables using BFS/DFS, ensuring that for each edge, x_u * x_v = s_uv and x_u and x_v are coprimes.\n\n3. For each node u in the component:\n\n   a. Collect all g's from edges connected to u.\n\n   b. Compute G_u as the LCM of these g's.\n\n   c. Find the edge (u, v) with g = g_x (any edge, perhaps the first one).\n\n   d. Compute a_u_candidate = g_x * x_u.\n\n   e. Check if a_u_candidate is a multiple of G_u.\n\n   f. If any node fails this check, component is invalid.\n\nIf all steps pass, component is valid.\n\nElse, overall answer is NO.\n\nSo, in code, how to implement this.\n\nImplementing steps 1 and 2 is manageable.\n\nBut step 3 is a bit involved.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nNow, the plan for the code:\n\nRead the input.\n\nBuild a graph where each edge has information about the g and l, and the two nodes it connects.\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n   Check for cycles, and compute the product of s's for each cycle. If any cycle's product isn't a perfect square, mark component as invalid.\n\n   Else, assign x values.\n\n      Choose a root, assign x[root] = 1.\n\n      BFS/DFS to assign x values.\n\n      For each edge, during traversal:\n\n         if it's a parent edge, assign x_child = s_uv / x_parent.\n\n         check if x_child is integer, and x_parent and x_child are coprimes.\n\n         if not, invalid.\n\n         if it's a back edge, check x_parent * x_child == s_uv.\n\n   After BFS/DFS, for each node u:\n\n      collect all g's from edges connected to u.\n\n      compute G_u = LCM of all g's.\n\n      find any edge (u, v) with g = g_x.\n\n      compute a_u_candidate = g_x * x[u].\n\n      check if a_u_candidate % G_u == 0.\n\n      if not, invalid.\n\nIf any component is invalid, output NO.\n\nElse, compute a_i = g_x * x[i], where g_x is the GCD of the edge used to assign x.\n\nWait, but how to find g_x for each node?\n\nWait, perhaps for each node, we can take the first edge and use its g as g_x.\n\nBut this may not be correct if the node has multiple edges.\n\nAlternatively, for each node u, iterate over all edges connected to u, collect their g's, and compute G_u as the LCM.\n\nThen, select any edge (u, v) with g = g_x, where g_x is the GCD of that edge.\n\nWait, but perhaps the first edge is sufficient.\n\nBut in any case, for each node, we have a G_u, and for a candidate a_u, it must be a multiple of G_u.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nAfter BFS/DFS, for each node u:\n\n   collect all g's in edges connected to u.\n\n   compute G_u = LCM of all g's.\n\n   for each edge (u, v):\n\n      current_g = edge.g\n\n      current_l = edge.l\n\n      s = current_g * current_l // (a_u * a_v) ? No, wait s is l/g.\n\n      Wait, for edge (u, v), a_u * a_v = g * l.\n\n      But a_u = current_g * x_u.\n\n      a_v = current_g * x_v.\n\n      So, a_u * a_v = current_g^2 * x_u x_v = current_g * l → x_u x_v = l / current_g.\n\n      Which is the same as s = l / current_g.\n\n      So, for each edge, s_uv = l / current_g.\n\n      So, for the edge (u, v), s_uv = l / current_g.\n\n      So, during the BFS, s_uv is known.\n\nBut in the BFS, we've already processed the s for each edge.\n\nSo, during the BFS, for each edge (u, v), s_uv is computed as l / current_g.\n\nThus, for the code:\n\nWe'll represent each edge as a tuple (u, v, g, l), and for each edge, compute s_uv = l // g.\n\nBut we need to ensure that l is divisible by g, otherwise, the edge is invalid.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the initial numbers on the roads were such that GCD <= LCM, so l is always >= g, and since l must be a multiple of g, s_uv will be an integer.\n\nSo, for each edge, s_uv = l // g.\n\nThus, for each edge, s_uv is an integer.\n\nThus, during the BFS:\n\nFor each edge, compute s_uv = l // g.\n\nThen, during the BFS, for each edge (u, v):\n\nIf u is the parent of v:\n\n   x_v = s_uv / x_u.\n\n   check if x_v is integer, and x_u and x_v are coprimes.\n\nElse if v is the parent of u:\n\n   x_u = s_uv / x_v.\n\n   check same.\n\nElse:\n\n   check if x_u * x_v == s_uv.\n\nThus, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nSo, to recap, the steps for each component are:\n\n1. Check for cycles, and for each cycle, compute the product of s's along the cycle. If it's not a perfect square, component is invalid.\n\n2. Assign x values via BFS/DFS, ensuring that for each edge, x_u * x_v = s_uv and x_u and x_v are coprimes.\n\n3. For each node u, compute G_u as the LCM of all g's from edges connected to u.\n\n4. For each node u, check that a_u = g_x * x_u is a multiple of G_u, where g_x is the GCD of any edge connected to u.\n\nIf all steps pass, the component is valid.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nWe can represent each node's edges as a list of tuples (v, g, l).\n\nWe can represent the graph as an adjacency list.\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n   Check for cycles and compute cycle products.\n\n   If any cycle's product is not a perfect square, mark as invalid.\n\n   Else, proceed to assign x values.\n\n   Choose a root (e.g., the first node in the component).\n\n   Assign x[root] = 1.\n\n   Perform BFS or DFS.\n\n   For each edge (",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to assign numbers to lawns such that all given edges' GCD and LCM conditions are satisfied. If possible, we should output any valid assignment; otherwise, we should output \"NO\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the problem as a graph where each node is a lawn and each edge has a GCD and LCM pair.\n2. **Cycle Check**: For each connected component, check for cycles. If any cycle exists, ensure the product of the s values (where s = LCM / GCD for each edge in the cycle) is a perfect square. If not, the component is invalid.\n3. **BFS/DFS for x Values**: Use BFS or DFS to assign values to each node starting from a root node. Ensure that each edge's constraints are satisfied, i.e., the product of the assigned values equals s and they are coprime.\n4. **Validation**: After assigning values, validate each node to ensure all
