She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Luba is trying to close some tabs in her browser. Hmm, let me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo, the setup is that she has n tabs open, from 1 to n. The cursor starts at position pos. She needs to keep the tabs from l to r and close all others. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right, but only within the current available tabs. Or she can close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum number of seconds needed to achieve this.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. It seems like a state problem where each state is determined by the current position of the cursor and which tabs are still open. But considering that n can be up to 100, it's manageable, but perhaps there's a smarter way than brute-forcing all possibilities.\n\nWait, maybe I can break it down into steps. What needs to be done is:\n\n1. Move the cursor to a position where closing left or right tabs would help.\n2. Close the tabs to the left or right as much as possible in one step.\n\nFor example, if the current position is somewhere in the middle, she can move to the left end of the desired segment, close all left tabs, then move to the right end and close all right tabs.\n\nBut wait, sometimes it's better to do the opposite: move to the right end first and close right, then left. So I need to calculate both possibilities and choose the minimal time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she doesn't need to move at all if the current position is already optimal for closing tabs.\n\nLet me outline the possible cases.\n\nCase 1: All tabs outside [l, r] are already closed. Then, the answer is zero.\n\nWait, no. The initial state has all tabs open. So unless l=1 and r=n, she needs to close some tabs.\n\nWait, no, the initial state is that all tabs are open, and she's starting from pos.\n\nSo, the initial a is 1, b is n.\n\nShe needs to have, after operations, that the only open tabs are those between l and r.\n\nSo, the process involves:\n\n- Closing all tabs to the left of l and to the right of r.\n\nEach close operation can be done in one step: close left (which closes everything to the left of current cursor) or close right (everything to the right).\n\nBut before that, she needs to position herself correctly to perform these close operations.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Move to the optimal position to close left, then close left.\n2. Move to the optimal position to close right, then close right.\n\nAlternatively, decide whether to close left first or right first, whichever is faster.\n\nHmm, so the steps could involve moving to the left end of the desired range, then close left, then move to the right end and close right. Alternatively, maybe it's better to close right first if the cursor is closer to the right end.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal approach is:\n\n- Determine the positions to close left (position l) and to close right (position r).\n\nBut she might not need to move to l and r if she can close in a single movement.\n\nWait, no. Because when she's at position l, closing left will close all tabs before l. Similarly, at position r, closing right will close all after r.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Move to l, close left (cost: |pos - l| + 1)\nOR\n- Move to r, close right (cost: |pos - r| + 1)\n\nBut wait, maybe she can close both in two steps, but perhaps it's better to first close one side and then the other, possibly with less movement.\n\nWait, another option is to close the left first, then the right. Or vice versa.\n\nSo, let's consider all possibilities.\n\nOption A: Close left first.\n\n- Move to l: distance is |pos - l|\n- Close left: +1\n- Then, move to r: distance is |l - r|\n- Close right: +1\nTotal cost: (|pos - l| + |l - r|) + 2\n\nOption B: Close right first.\n\n- Move to r: |pos - r|\n- Close right: +1\n- Then, move to l: |r - l|\n- Close left: +1\nTotal cost: (|pos - r| + |r - l|) + 2\n\nOption C: Maybe she can close both in a single movement, but I don't think so because each close is a separate action.\n\nWait, no. Each close action is a single step. So, she can't do both in one step.\n\nSo, the minimal cost would be the minimum between Option A and Option B.\n\nWait, but what if l == r? Then, she just needs to close all tabs except l, but in that case, perhaps she can just close left and right in two steps.\n\nWait, for example, if l = r, then after moving to l, she can close left and right in one step? No, because closing left would close everything to the left of l, and closing right would close everything to the right of l. So, she needs to do both.\n\nWait, no. If l = r, then she needs to close all tabs except l. So, she can do:\n\nMove to l: distance from pos to l.\n\nClose left: +1.\n\nClose right: +1.\n\nTotal cost: (|pos - l|) + 2.\n\nAlternatively, she can close right first, then left, but that's the same as above.\n\nSo, for the case when l < r, the options are to close left first or right first, each taking (distance to l + distance to r) + 2 steps.\n\nBut wait, maybe she can do better. What if she is already in a position where she can close both without moving much.\n\nFor example, if the initial position is such that she can close left and then right without moving, but that depends on where l and r are.\n\nWait, maybe there's another scenario where she can close both in two steps without needing to move beyond certain points.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a smarter way to compute the minimal steps.\n\nAnother approach: the minimal steps required are the sum of the steps to reach l, close left, then reach r, close right. Or the same for closing right first.\n\nSo, the minimal is min( (distance to l + distance to r) * 2 + 2, ... )\n\nWait, but perhaps she can combine the movement steps.\n\nWait, for instance, if she goes from pos to l to r, that's |pos - l| + (r - l). But then she has to close both, adding 2 steps.\n\nAlternatively, if she goes to r first, then to l, that's |pos - r| + (r - l), plus 2 steps.\n\nSo, the total steps are (|pos - l| + (r - l)) + 2, or (|pos - r| + (r - l)) + 2.\n\nWhich is better? Let's see.\n\nCompare (|pos - l| + (r - l)) vs (|pos - r| + (r - l)).\n\nIf pos is closer to l, then the first option is better. Otherwise, the second.\n\nSo the minimal steps would be:\n\nmin( (|pos - l| + (r - l)) + 2, (|pos - r| + (r - l)) + 2 )\n\nBut wait, the (r-l) is fixed in both cases. So it's equivalent to comparing |pos - l| vs |pos - r|.\n\nSo, if pos is closer to l, then the first option is better, else the second.\n\nSo, the minimal steps would be (min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) ) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because in the first case, you go from pos to l, then to r. That's |pos - l| + (r - l) steps. Then add 2 for closing.\n\nIn the second case, you go from pos to r, then to l. That's |pos - r| + (r - l) steps. Add 2.\n\nSo, the minimal is min( |pos - l| + (r - l), |pos - r| + (r - l) ) + 2.\n\nWhich can be written as (r - l) + min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|) + 2.\n\nWait, but that's only true if the path from l to r is straight, which it is because l < r.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another scenario where she can close both in a single step, but I don't think so.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose l=2, r=4, and pos=3.\n\nThen, moving to l (2) takes 1 step, then to r (4) takes 2 steps (2->3->4). So total movement steps: 3. Then, 2 steps for closing. Total 5 steps.\n\nWhich matches the sample input where the output is 5.\n\nAnother example: Input '6 3 1 3' → Output '1'.\n\nIn this case, she needs to close tabs outside 1-3. The initial position is 3.\n\nShe can close the right of 3 in one step. Because closing right would close tabs 4,5,6. So she doesn't need to move. So the steps are 1 (close right). So the output is 1.\n\nAnother test case is when l=1, r=5, and pos=2. Then, she needs to close left (tabs 1 is already included, so no) and close right (nothing to close since r=5 is the end). So, she can just close the right, but wait, no—she needs to close all tabs outside [1,5], which are nothing. Wait, no: the desired state is [l, r], which is [1,5]. So in this case, no tabs need to be closed. So the output is 0.\n\nWait, no, in the third example given in the problem statement, the input is '5 2 1 5', and the output is 0. So yes, when l=1 and r=n, no tabs need to be closed.\n\nSo, back to the problem.\n\nThe first thing to check is whether l=1 and r=n. If so, output 0.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, for the general case:\n\nWe need to find the minimal steps to close all tabs to the left of l and all tabs to the right of r.\n\nSo, the steps required are:\n\nEither:\n\n1. Move to l, close left (cost |pos - l| + 1), then move to r, close right (cost |l - r| + 1). Total steps: |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2.\n\nOr:\n\n2. Move to r, close right (cost |pos - r| + 1), then move to l, close left (cost |r - l| + 1). Total steps: |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nWhich is better?\n\nSo, the minimal steps would be the minimum between these two options.\n\nBut wait, sometimes, moving directly from l to r is not the fastest. For example, if pos is in between l and r, then moving from l to r is just (r - l) steps. But if pos is outside l and r, then the movement may require more steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the minimal steps for each of the two options and take the smaller.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n\noption1 = (distance from pos to l) + (distance from l to r) + 2.\n\noption2 = (distance from pos to r) + (distance from r to l) + 2.\n\nWait, but the distance from l to r is (r - l). So option1 is (|pos - l|) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nSimilarly, option2 is (|pos - r|) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nSo, the minimal of option1 and option2 is the minimal steps.\n\nWait, but let's think about when l and r are adjacent. For example, l=3, r=4, and pos is 2.\n\nOption1: move from 2 to 3 (1 step), close left (1 step), then move to 4 (1 step), close right (1 step). Total 4 steps.\n\nOption2: move from 2 to 4 (2 steps), close right (1 step), then move back to 3 (1 step), close left (1 step). Total 5 steps.\n\nSo option1 is better.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nAnother example: l=2, r=4, pos=3.\n\nOption1: 1 + 2 + 2 =5.\n\nOption2: 1 + 2 +2=5. So same.\n\nSo, the formula gives correct result.\n\nWhat about when pos is at l? Then option1 is 0 + (r-l) + 2. Option2 is (r - l) + (r-l) + 2 = 2(r-l)+2.\n\nSo, option1 is better.\n\nSo, the minimal steps are the minimum between option1 and option2.\n\nBut wait, another scenario: what if she can close both in a single movement? Like, perhaps she can close left and then close right without moving much.\n\nBut I think the formula covers that.\n\nAnother edge case: when l=r. So, she needs to close all tabs except l.\n\nIn this case, she can move to l, close left (which closes everything to the left of l, but l is the only one that remains), and then close right (but after closing left, the right is l+1 to r, but wait, after closing left, the a becomes l, and the b becomes the previous b.\n\nWait, no. When she closes left, the a becomes l. So any remaining tabs are from l to b.\n\nSo, after closing left, she needs to close right of l, which is from l+1 to previous b.\n\nSo, in the case l=r, she needs to close all tabs except l.\n\nSo, she can:\n\n- Move to l: distance is |pos - l|.\n\n- Close left: 1 step.\n\n- Now, the right of l is l+1 to b, but since l=r, she needs to close everything to the right of l. So she needs to move to l (already there?), then close right.\n\nWait, but after closing left, the a is l. So the right of l is from l+1 to current b, which was r.\n\nWait, in this case, after closing left, the remaining tabs are l to r. But she needs to close all except l, so she must close the right of l. So she needs to move to r, then close right.\n\nWait, no. Because after closing left, she's at l. Then she needs to close all tabs to the right of l. So she can move to r, then close right. But r is now the new b, since the a is l.\n\nWait, perhaps she can just move to l, close left (1 step), then move to r (r - l steps), close right (1 step). So total steps: (|pos - l| + (r-l) ) + 2.\n\nWhich aligns with the formula.\n\nSo, the formula seems to cover all cases.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nFirst, check if l == 1 and r == n. If yes, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute option1 = (distance from pos to l) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nCompute option2 = (distance from pos to r) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nTake the minimum of option1 and option2.\n\nThat's the minimal steps.\n\nWait, but what about when the initial position is already beyond l or r? Or in such a way that she can close both in one movement.\n\nWait, perhaps in some cases, she can close both in fewer steps.\n\nWait, let's think about another scenario.\n\nSuppose l=2, r=4, pos=5.\n\nOption1: move to 2 (distance 3), close left (1), move to 4 (distance 2), close right (1). Total 7 steps.\n\nOption2: move to 4 (distance 1), close right (1), move to 2 (distance 2), close left (1). Total 5 steps.\n\nSo, option2 is better.\n\nSo, the formula gives 3+2+2=7 for option1, and 1+2+2=5 for option2. So minimal is 5.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother case: pos is 1, l=3, r=5.\n\nOption1: move to 3 (2 steps), close left (1), move to 5 (2 steps), close right (1). Total 6 steps.\n\nOption2: move to 5 (4 steps), close right (1), move to 3 (2 steps), close left (1). Total 8 steps.\n\nSo, option1 is better.\n\nSo the formula holds.\n\nAnother test case: pos=3, l=2, r=4. Steps are 5, as in the sample.\n\nSo, yes, the formula seems to hold.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read n, pos, l, r.\n\n- If l == 1 and r ==n: output 0.\n\n- Else:\n\n   compute steps for option1 and option2.\n\n   option1 = |pos - l| + (r-l) + 2.\n\n   option2 = |pos - r| + (r-l) + 2.\n\n   minimal_steps = min(option1, option2).\n\n   output minimal_steps.\n\nWait, but what about the case where she can close both in a single movement.\n\nWait, no, because each close is a separate step.\n\nWait, what about when she is at position l, and can close left and then close right without moving.\n\nNo, she needs to move to r to close right.\n\nSo, the formula is correct.\n\nWait, but what about when the initial position is in [l, r].\n\nLike, l=2, r=4, pos=3.\n\nThen, option1 is 1 + 2 +2=5.\n\nOption2 is 1 + 2 +2=5.\n\nSo, same.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: l=1, r=5, pos=3.\n\nShe needs to close all except 1-5. Since l=1 and r=5, which is the entire set, output is 0.\n\nWait, no. Because l=1 and r=5 is the entire set, so no tabs need to be closed.\n\nSo, output is 0.\n\nBut according to the formula, since l != 1 and r !=n, but wait, n=5, l=1, r=5. So condition is met, output 0.\n\nSo, code-wise, the first step is to check if l ==1 and r ==n. If so, output 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the third case is '5 2 1 5', which outputs 0. So correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. As per the first sample, the output is 5.\n\nAccording to the formula, option1 is |3-2| + 2 + 2 =1+2+2=5.\n\nOption2 is |3-4| + 2 +2=1+2+2=5. So min is 5.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3. So, she needs to close 4,5,6.\n\nShe is at 3. So, she can close right in one step. So, steps=1.\n\nAccording to formula:\n\noption1: |3-1| + (3-1) +2 =2+2+2=6.\n\noption2: |3-3| +2+2=0+2+2=4.\n\nWait, but the correct answer is 1. So what's wrong here.\n\nAh! Oh right, I think I made a mistake.\n\nBecause when l=1 and r=3, and she is at 3, she can close right, which will close tabs 4,5,6. So she just needs to close right once.\n\nSo, the formula is not considering this case.\n\nWait, why? Because according to the formula, the minimal steps would be min(option1, option2).\n\nBut in this case, she can close right without moving.\n\nSo, the formula isn't accounting for cases where she can close one side without moving.\n\nSo, the formula is incorrect.\n\nHmm, that's a problem.\n\nI need to adjust the approach.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula is correct when l < r, but when l <= pos <= r, she can close the other side in one step without moving.\n\nWait, but in the example I'm thinking, l=1, r=3, and pos=3.\n\nShe can close right (tabs 4-6) in one step.\n\nBut according to the formula, option2 is |3-3| + (3-1) + 2 → 0 + 2 + 2=4 steps, but the actual steps are 1.\n\nSo the formula is wrong.\n\nWait, what's happening here.\n\nThe formula is designed to handle when she needs to close both left and right of the desired segment. But in this case, she only needs to close the right side.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is that the formula assumes that she has to close both left and right, but sometimes she only needs to close one side.\n\nAh, right. So the formula is only applicable when both ends need to be closed. But if l=1, then she doesn't need to close anything on the left. Similarly, if r=n, she doesn't need to close anything on the right.\n\nSo, the formula is only considering the case where both sides need to be closed. But in cases where only one side needs to be closed, the formula may overcount.\n\nSo, the approach needs to be adjusted.\n\nSo, the problem is: determine whether the current position allows her to close the required parts without moving.\n\nSo, the steps should be calculated based on whether she needs to close left, right, or both.\n\nSo, the minimal steps depend on whether she needs to close left, right, or both.\n\nSo, the problem can be broken down into several cases:\n\nCase 1: l > 1 and r < n.\n\nIn this case, she needs to close both left and right.\n\nSo, she has to perform two close operations, each requiring moving to their respective ends.\n\nSo, the steps are as per the formula.\n\nCase 2: l == 1 and r < n.\n\nShe only needs to close the right side. So, she can move to r, close right, which closes everything to the right of r. So, steps are |pos - r| + 1.\n\nCase 3: l > 1 and r ==n.\n\nShe only needs to close the left side. Steps are |pos - l| +1.\n\nCase 4: l ==1 and r ==n.\n\nShe needs to close nothing. Steps 0.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nCheck which case we're in.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nif l == 1 and r ==n:\n    steps =0\nelif l ==1:\n    # need to close right\n    steps = |pos - r| +1\nelif r ==n:\n    # need to close left\n    steps = |pos - l| +1\nelse:\n    # need to close both left and right\n    # compute option1 and option2\n    option1 = |pos - l| + (r-l) + 2\n    option2 = |pos - r| + (r-l) + 2\n    steps = min(option1, option2)\n\nWait, but in the case where l==1 and r <n, she can just move to r and close right, which is |pos - r| +1.\n\nSimilarly, when r ==n and l>1, she can move to l and close left.\n\nSo, the formula needs to be adjusted to account for these cases.\n\nSo, let's rework the logic.\n\nFirst, check if l ==1 and r ==n. If yes, output 0.\n\nElse, check if l ==1. If yes, she needs to close right (since all tabs to the right of r need to be closed). So steps are |pos - r| +1.\n\nElse, check if r ==n. If yes, she needs to close left. Steps: |pos - l| +1.\n\nElse, she needs to close both left and right. So compute option1 and option2 as before.\n\nSo, the code should implement this logic.\n\nTesting this with the earlier example:\n\nSample input 2: 6 3 1 3.\n\nHere, l=1, r=3 <6. So steps are |3-3| +1=0+1=1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nAs in the first sample, l!=1, r!=6, so compute option1 and option2.\n\nOption1: |3-2|=1, r-l=2, +2 → 1+2+2=5.\n\nOption2: |3-4|=1, +2+2=5. So min is 5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5.\n\nSince l=1 and r=5, output 0.\n\nAnother case: n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=4.\n\nShe needs to close right of 4. Steps: |3-4|=1 +1=2.\n\nSo, output is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=5.\n\nShe needs to close left (tabs 1) and right (tabs 6).\n\nSo, compute option1: |3-2|=1, (5-2)=3, +2 → 1+3+2=6.\n\nOption2: |3-5|=2, 3+2=5 → 2+3+2=7.\n\nSo minimal is 6.\n\nSo steps would be 6.\n\nSo, the code should correctly handle all these cases.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nif l ==1 and r ==n:\n    print(0)\nelif l ==1:\n    # close right\n    steps = abs(pos - r) +1\nelif r ==n:\n    # close left\n    steps = abs(pos - l) +1\nelse:\n    # compute both options\n    option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) +2\n    option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) +2\n    steps = min(option1, option2)\nprint(steps)\n\nWait, but what about when she needs to close both, but the minimal steps involve moving to l, then r, but perhaps she can optimize the movement.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct because the movement from l to r is (r-l) steps, which is optimal.\n\nSo, I think the code is correct.\n\nLet me test the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 6 3 2 4.\n\nOutput is 5.\n\nAs per code:\n\nl=2 !=1, r=4 !=6.\n\noption1: |3-2|=1, 4-2=2 →1+2+2=5.\n\noption2: |3-4|=1, 2+2=4 →1+2+2=5.\n\nmin is 5. Correct.\n\nSample 2: 6 3 1 3.\n\nl=1, r=3<6.\n\nsteps: |3-3| +1=0+1=1. Correct.\n\nSample3:5 2 1 5 → output 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=6, pos=3, l=3, r=6.\n\nThen, l=3, r=6 !=n (n=6), so code enters else.\n\noption1: |3-3|=0, 3 steps (6-3=3) +2 → 0+3+2=5.\n\noption2: |3-6|=3, 3+2=5 → 3+3+2=8. So min is 5.\n\nSo steps are 5.\n\nWhich would involve:\n\nmove to 3, close left (tabs 1-2) → 1 step.\n\nthen move to 6, close right (tabs 7-6? No, 6 is the last tab, so nothing to close). Wait, no.\n\nWait, after closing left, she is at 3. Then she needs to close right of 6, but 6 is the maximum, so nothing to close. So, perhaps she doesn't need to close right.\n\nWait, wait. No, in this case, the desired state is [3,6]. So, she needs to close all tabs outside this segment.\n\nInitially, a=1, b=6.\n\nShe needs to close all to the left of 3 and all to the right of 6.\n\nWait, but 6 is the maximum, so she needs to close the right of 6, which is nothing. So, she only needs to close the left.\n\nSo, in this case, the code would not enter the 'else' clause.\n\nWait, because l=3 !=1, and r=6 ==n=6.\n\nSo, the code would enter the 'elif r ==n' clause.\n\nSo steps are |3 -3| +1=0+1=1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAh, I see. So my code handles this case correctly.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nThus, the approach is to implement the code as described.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment [l, r] in her browser. The solution involves calculating the optimal path for closing the necessary tabs efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Edge Cases**: \n   - If the entire range of tabs (from 1 to n) is within the segment [l, r], no tabs need to be closed, so the result is 0.\n   \n2. **Single Side Closing**:\n   - If the segment starts at the first tab (l = 1), only the right side of the segment needs to be closed. Calculate the steps required to move to the end of the segment and close the right side.\n   - Similarly, if the segment ends at the last tab (r = n), only the left side of the segment needs to be closed. Calculate the steps required to move to the start of the segment and close the left side.\n\n3. **Both Sides Closing**:\n   - When both sides of the segment need to be closed, compute the steps required for two scenarios:\n     - Moving to the start of the segment, closing the left side, then moving to the end and closing the right side.\n     - Moving to the end of the segment, closing the right side, then moving to the start and closing the left side.\n   - Choose the scenario with the minimum number of steps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelif l == 1:\n    print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\nelif r == n:\n    print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\nelse:\n    option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n    option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Edge Case Handling**: The code first checks if the entire range of tabs is within the desired segment, resulting in 0 steps needed.\n- **Single Side Closing**: If the segment starts at the first tab or ends at the last tab, the code calculates the steps required to close only the necessary side.\n- **Both Sides Closing**: For segments that neither start at the first tab nor end at the last tab, the code computes the steps for both possible optimal paths and selects the minimum.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum steps required by considering all possible scenarios and choosing the optimal path.",
