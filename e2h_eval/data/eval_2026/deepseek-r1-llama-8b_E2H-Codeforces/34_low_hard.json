And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the average sleep time per week for Polycarp based on his sleep records over n days. Each week consists of k consecutive days. So there are (n - k + 1) possible weeks. For each week, we sum the sleep times of those k days and then compute the average by dividing the total sum by the number of weeks.\n\nHmm, right. The input gives n and k, followed by a list of a1 to an. The output should be the average with at least six decimal places.\n\nLet's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to process all possible consecutive k-day windows in the array a. For each window, calculate the sum of its elements, add all these sums together, and then divide by the number of windows to get the average.\n\nBut wait, if n is up to 2e5, doing this naively by iterating through each window and summing each time would take O(nk) time, which could be up to 2e10 operations. That's way too slow for Python; it won't handle that in reasonable time.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way to compute the sums. Oh right, the sliding window technique can help here. Because each new window only adds one element and removes the first element from the previous window.\n\nWait, but the sliding window for sum works when we can compute the sum incrementally. Let me think: initially, the first window is the sum of the first k elements. Then, for each subsequent window, subtract the element leaving the window and add the new element entering.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the initial sum for the first window.\n2. Add this sum to a running total.\n3. For each next window:\n   a. Subtract the outgoing element (the first element of the previous window).\n   b. Add the incoming element (the next element after the previous window ends).\n   c. Add this new sum to the running total.\n4. After processing all windows, divide the total sum by the number of windows to get the average.\n\nThat way, the time complexity becomes O(n), which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nGreat! So the plan is:\n\n- Read n and k from input.\n- Read the array a.\n- If k is equal to n, then there's only one window, just return the sum divided by 1.\n- Otherwise, compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n- Initialize the total sum as this initial value.\n- Then, for each i from k to n-1 (since arrays are 0-based?), subtract a[i - k] and add a[i], and add the new sum to the total.\n- Finally, compute the average as total_sum / (number of windows), which is (n - k + 1).\n\nWait, but wait, the initial sum is added once, then for each of the remaining (n - k) windows, we add their sum. So the loop runs for (n -k) times, adding each sum to the total.\n\nSo the code structure would be something like:\n\nsum_total = sum(a[0:k])\ncount = 1\nfor i in range(k, len(a)):\n    sum_total += a[i] - a[i - k]\n    count += 1\n\nThen average = sum_total / count.\n\nWait, but no, because in the first step, sum_total is the sum of the first window, and for each next window, we compute the new sum and add to sum_total. But wait, no: in each iteration, the new sum is the current window's sum, which is the previous sum minus a[i-k] plus a[i]. So each time, the sum for the window is computed, and added to the total.\n\nWait no, wait: the initial sum is the first window, which is added to sum_total. Then, for each next window, we compute the new sum by subtracting the outgoing element and adding the incoming, and then add this new sum to sum_total. So yes, each window contributes its sum to the total.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nsum_total = sum(a[0:k])\nwindow_count = 1\nfor i in range(k, n):\n    sum_total += a[i] - a[i - k]\n    window_count += 1\n\naverage = sum_total / window_count\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, let's think about the data types. Since n can be up to 2e5 and each a_i up to 1e5, the sum can be up to 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10. Adding all such sums (up to 2e5 windows) could make the total sum up to 2e15, which is within the range of Python's integers, so no problem.\n\nRegarding output: the average",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time per week for Polycarp based on his sleep records over n days. Each week consists of k consecutive days, and we need to compute the average over all possible weeks formed by these consecutive days.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We are given a sequence of sleep times for n days and need to compute the average sleep time per week. A week is defined as k consecutive days. There are (n - k + 1) such possible weeks.\n2. **Efficient Sum Calculation**: Instead of recalculating the sum for each window from scratch, we use a sliding window technique to efficiently compute the sum for each subsequent window. This reduces the time complexity from O(nk) to O(n).\n3. **Sliding Window Technique**: \n   - Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n   - For each subsequent window, update the sum by subtracting the element that is leaving the window and adding the new element that is entering the window.\n   - Keep a running total of all window sums.\n4. **Average Calculation**: After computing the total sum of all windows, divide it by the number of windows to get the average sleep time per week.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    \n    if k == 0:\n        print(0.0)\n        return\n    \n    current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n    window_count = 1\n    total = current_sum\n    \n    for i in range(k, n):\n        current_sum += a[i] - a[i - k]\n        total += current_sum\n        window_count += 1\n    \n    average = total / window_count\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single string and split into individual components. The first two values are n and k, followed by the sleep times for n days.\n- **Initial Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first k elements is computed to initialize the sliding window.\n- **Sliding Window Update**: For each subsequent element, the window sum is updated by adding the new element and subtracting the element that is no longer in the window. This sum is added to the total.\n- **Average Calculation**: The total sum of all window sums is divided by the number of windows to get the average sleep time per week, which is then printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles all edge cases, providing the correct result within the required precision.",
