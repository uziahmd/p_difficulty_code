During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.Neko has two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $$$k$$$ such that the least common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $$$k$$$, he needs to choose the smallest one.Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b \\le 10^9$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint the smallest non-negative integer $$$k$$$ ($$$k \\ge 0$$$) such that the lowest common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible.If there are many possible integers $$$k$$$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 10', '21 31', '5 10']\n\n### Output\n['2', '9', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test, one should choose $$$k = 2$$$, as the least common multiple of $$$6 + 2$$$ and $$$10 + 2$$$ is $$$24$$$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where given two integers a and b, I have to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a+k) and (b+k) is minimized. And if there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest one.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's happening when we add k to both a and b. The new numbers are a + k and b + k. But wait, since a and b could be in any order, maybe I should first compute the difference between them. Oh right, because if a is larger than b, then adding k to both doesn't change their order. Wait no, if a > b, then a +k is still bigger than b +k. So the LCM would be a +k if they are coprime, but maybe not.\n\nWait, actually, the LCM of two numbers x and y is (x*y)/GCD(x,y). So, for a +k and b +k, their GCD is important here.\n\nLet me denote d = |a - b|. Because when you add k to both, the difference remains the same as d. So the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) would be the same as the GCD of (d, (a +k) - (b +k)) which simplifies to GCD(d, a - b). Since d is fixed, the GCD depends on the difference between a and b.\n\nWait, no. Let me see: the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) is equal to the GCD of (a +k - (b +k)) and (b +k), which is GCD(a - b, b +k). But a - b could be positive or negative; the absolute value matters. So, it's GCD(d, b +k), where d is |a - b|.\n\nWait, no, because GCD is always non-negative. So yes, the GCD is GCD(d, b +k).\n\nSo, the LCM of a +k and b +k is (a +k)*(b +k) / GCD(a +k, b +k) = (a +k)(b +k) / g, where g is GCD(a +k, b +k).\n\nBut since g is GCD(d, b +k), because a +k - (b +k) = a - b, which is either d or -d, depending on which is bigger. So, regardless, the GCD is the same as GCD(d, b +k).\n\nHmm. So, the problem reduces to finding k such that GCD(d, b +k) is as large as possible, because a larger GCD would make the LCM smaller.\n\nWait, because the LCM is (a +k)(b +k)/g. If g is large, then the LCM is small. So, the optimal k is the one that maximizes g, which is GCD(d, b +k). But we also need to consider the product (a +k)(b +k) being as small as possible.\n\nWait, no. Because sometimes, even if g is large, the product might be too big. So, perhaps the optimal point is where g is as large as possible, but also considering the product.\n\nThis seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can model this differently.\n\nLet me consider that for any k, the two numbers are a +k and b +k. Letâ€™s denote x = a +k and y = b +k. Then, since x - y = a - b, which is a fixed value. So, x = y + (a - b). Or y = x + (b - a), depending on which is larger.\n\nThe LCM of x and y is (x * y) / g, where g is GCD(x, y). Since x - y is fixed as d, which is |a - b|, the GCD(x, y) must divide d. So, the possible values of g are the divisors of d.\n\nWait, yes. Because GCD(x, y) divides x - y, which is d. So, any divisor of d is a possible value for g.\n\nSo, for each possible divisor g of d, we can try to find the k that makes GCD(x, y) equal to g. Then, among all these possibilities, we can choose the one that gives the minimal LCM.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|. If d is 0, then a and b are equal, so any k will make x = y = a +k, so the LCM is x, which is minimized when x is as small as possible. So,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \\( k \\) that yield the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key insight is that adding \\( k \\) to both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) results in two numbers whose difference remains constant. This constant difference, \\( d = |a - b| \\), plays a crucial role in determining the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two resulting numbers.\n\n2. **Divisors of Difference**: The GCD of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) must be a divisor of \\( d \\). Therefore, we can consider each divisor of \\( d \\) as a potential candidate for maximizing the GCD, which in turn minimizes the LCM.\n\n3. **Finding Optimal \\( k \\)**: For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( d \\), we determine the smallest \\( k \\) such that \\( g \\) is the GCD of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\). We then compute the LCM for each valid \\( k \\) and select the one with the smallest value.\n\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: By iterating over all divisors of \\( d \\) and checking the corresponding \\( k \\) values, we ensure that we efficiently find the optimal solution without unnecessary computations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef find_min_k(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return 0\n    d = abs(a - b)\n    current_gcd = d\n    best_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0\n\n    for g in get_divisors(d):\n        if g == 0:\n            continue\n        x = a + k_candidate(g, a, b)\n        y = b + k_candidate(g, a, b)\n        if math.gcd(x, y) != g:\n            continue\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // g\n        if current_lcm < best_lcm or (current_lcm == best_lcm and x < best_x):\n            best_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k_candidate(g, a, b)\n            best_x = x\n\n    return best_k\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\ndef k_candidate(g, a, b):\n    if a > b:\n        x = a + k\n        y = b + k\n        target = g\n        remainder = (b + k) % target\n        k = ((target - remainder) % target) - b\n    else:\n        x = b + k\n        y = a + k\n        target = g\n        remainder = (a + k) % target\n        k = ((target - remainder) % target) - a\n    return k\n\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    print(find_min_k(a, b))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If \\( a \\) equals \\( b \\), the smallest \\( k \\) is 0.\n3. **Divisor Calculation**: We generate all divisors of the absolute difference \\( d \\) between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n4. **Optimal \\( k \\) Search**: For each divisor \\( g \\), we compute the corresponding \\( k \\) that maximizes the GCD and thus minimizes the LCM.\n5. **LCM Calculation**: For each valid \\( k \\), we calculate the LCM and keep track of the smallest LCM and corresponding \\( k \\).\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal \\( k \\) by leveraging the properties of divisors and GCD, providing an optimal solution in a reasonable time frame.",
