He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve where I need to determine whether each of the given strings is a prefix or a suffix of some string s of length n. And then output a string composed of 'P's and 'S's indicating which are prefixes and which are suffixes.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. So the input gives 2n-2 strings, which includes all possible prefixes and suffixes of length from 1 to n-1. But they're mixed up, and I don't know which are prefixes and which are suffixes.\n\nThe goal is to assign each string as either a prefix (P) or suffix (S) such that there exists at least one string s of length n that has exactly those prefixes and suffixes.\n\nWait, but how do I figure out for each string whether it's a prefix or suffix? Because for each possible position in s, certain strings must be the correct prefix or suffix.\n\nMaybe I can model this by considering that the correct string s must have all its proper prefixes and suffixes present in the input. So the task is to find a way to assign P and S to each input string such that:\n\n- All the strings assigned as prefixes are indeed proper prefixes of s.\n- All the strings assigned as suffixes are indeed proper suffixes of s.\n- Additionally, the full string s can be determined based on these assignments.\n\nBut wait, the output doesn't require us to find s; we just need to correctly assign each input string as P or S.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to determine for each possible length l (from 1 to n-1), what the possible candidates are for the prefix of length l and the suffix of length l.\n\nBecause for each l, there are two strings: one must be the prefix of length l, and the other must be the suffix of length l. Wait no, because for each l, there are two strings, but only one could be the prefix and the other the suffix. Or maybe both could be something else?\n\nNo, that's not right. Because for a string s of length n, for each l, the prefix of length l is unique, and similarly for the suffix of length l. But since the input gives exactly two strings for each l, one must be the prefix and the other the suffix.\n\nWait, but for each l, how do I know which one is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nI think for l=1, the two strings must be the first character of s and the last character of s. So if s starts with 'a' and ends with 'b', then for l=1, the two strings are 'a' (prefix) and 'b' (suffix). So for l=1, the two strings are distinct, and one is the prefix, the other is the suffix.\n\nSimilarly, for l=2, the prefix is the first two characters of s, and the suffix is the last two. So for each l, the two strings are the possible prefix and suffix of that length.\n\nBut how do I connect them across different l's?\n\nAh, perhaps for each possible l, the prefix of length l must be a prefix of the prefix of length l+1. Similarly, the suffix of length l must be a suffix of the suffix of length l+1.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the prefix of length l is the beginning of the prefix of length l+1. So for example, if the prefix for l=2 is \"ab\", then the prefix for l=3 must start with \"ab\".\n\nSo for each l, the two possible strings (for that length) should form a chain where the prefix for l is a prefix of the prefix for l+1, and the suffix for l is a suffix of the suffix for l+1.\n\nWait, but for each l, there are two strings. So for l=1, let's say the two strings are 'a' and 'b'. Then for l=2, the two strings could be 'aa' and 'ab', but one of them must be the prefix for l=2, and the other the suffix.\n\nWait, no, because the suffix for l=2 must be the last two characters of s. So the suffix for l=1 is the last character of s. So for l=2, the suffix must end with the suffix for l=1.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So for each l, the suffix of length l must be a suffix of the suffix of length l+1. Because the suffix of l+1 is longer and ends with the suffix of l.\n\nSimilarly, the prefix of l must be a prefix of the prefix of l+1.\n\nSo the idea is to find, for each l from 1 to n-1, which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix, such that this condition holds.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. For each possible l, collect",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether each of the given strings is a prefix or a suffix of some string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes based on the constraints provided.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Prefixes and Suffixes**: For a string `s` of length `n`, all proper prefixes (from length 1 to n-1) and proper suffixes (from length 1 to n-1) are given. Each length from 1 to n-1 has exactly two strings, one being a prefix and the other a suffix.\n2. **Constraints on Prefixes and Suffixes**: \n   - The prefix of length `l` must be a prefix of the prefix of length `l+1`.\n   - The suffix of length `l` must be a suffix of the suffix of length `l+1`.\n3. **Chain Formation**: For each length `l`, the two strings must form a valid chain where one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. This ensures consistency across all lengths.\n4. **Determine Prefix/Suffix for Each Length**: By iterating through each possible length and checking which string can extend the previous prefix/suffix while maintaining the chain, we can assign each string as either a prefix or suffix.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nstrings = [input().strip() for _ in range(2*n-2)]\n\n# For each possible length, collect all candidates\nlength_to_candidates = {}\nfor s in strings:\n    l = len(s)\n    if l not in length_to_candidates:\n        length_to_candidates[l] = []\n    length_to_candidates[l].append(s)\n\n# Now, process from l=1 to l=n-1\nprefixes = {}\nsuffixes = {}\nfor l in range(1, n):\n    candidates = length_to_candidates[l]\n    # Try all possible assignments\n    for c1, c2 in candidates:\n        # Check if c1 can be the prefix of l, c2 the suffix\n        valid = True\n        # Check if c1 is a prefix of any longer prefix\n        if l > 1 and (prefixes.get(l-1) is None or not c1.startswith(prefixes[l-1])):\n            valid = False\n        # Similarly, check if c2 is a suffix of any longer suffix\n        if l > 1 and (suffixes.get(l-1) is None or not c2.endswith(suffixes[l-1])):\n            valid = False\n        # Also, check that the suffix starts with the previous suffix\n        # Wait no, because for the suffix, it's about the end, so for l, the suffix should end with the suffix of l-1\n        # So c2 must end with suffixes.get(l-1, '')\n        if valid:\n            if l == 1:\n                # For l=1, the suffix must end with itself\n                if c1 != c2:\n                    valid = False\n                else:\n                    prefixes[l] = c1\n                    suffixes[l] = c2\n            else:\n                # Check if c1 starts with the previous prefix\n                if not c1.startswith(prefixes[l-1]):\n                    valid = False\n                # Check if c2 ends with the previous suffix\n                if not c2.endswith(suffixes[l-1]):\n                    valid = False\n                if valid:\n                    prefixes[l] = c1\n                    suffixes[l] = c2\n        if valid:\n            break\n    if not valid:\n        # Try swapping c1 and c2\n        for c1, c2 in candidates:\n            valid = True\n            if l > 1 and (prefixes.get(l-1) is None or not c2.startswith(prefixes[l-1])):\n                valid = False\n            if l > 1 and (suffixes.get(l-1) is None or not c1.endswith(suffixes[l-1])):\n                valid = False\n            if valid:\n                if l == 1:\n                    if c2 != c1:\n                        valid = False\n                    else:\n                        prefixes[l] = c2\n                        suffixes[l] = c1\n                else:\n                    if not c2.startswith(prefixes[l-1]):\n                        valid = False\n                    if not c1.endswith(suffixes[l-1]):\n                        valid = False\n                    if valid:\n                        prefixes[l] = c2\n                        suffixes[l] = c1\n            if valid:\n                break\n\nresult = []\nfor s in strings:\n    l = len(s)\n    if l in prefixes:\n        result.append('P')\n    elif l in suffixes:\n        result.append('S')\n    else:\n        # This shouldn't happen as per problem statement\n        result.append('P' if 'P' else 'S')\n\nprint(''.join(result))\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe code processes each string by first categorizing them by their lengths. It then iterates through each possible length from 1 to n-1, determining which string is the prefix and which is the suffix based on the constraints that they must extend the previous prefixes and suffixes correctly. This ensures that the assignment is consistent and valid for the entire string. Finally, it constructs the result string by marking each input string as 'P' or 'S' based on its role.",
