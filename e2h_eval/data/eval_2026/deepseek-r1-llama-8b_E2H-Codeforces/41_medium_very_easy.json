There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and I need to figure out the best way to approach it. Let's read through the problem statement again carefully.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on spots along a street. Each spot can have a house with a height between 0 and h, inclusive. For each spot, the profit from that house is the square of its height. But there are some restrictions: for certain ranges of spots, the tallest house in that range must be at most a given x_i. The goal is to maximize the total profit while satisfying all these restrictions.\n\nHmm. So, the input gives n spots, maximum height h, and m restrictions. Each restriction specifies a range [l_i, r_i] and a maximum height x_i. All these restrictions must be satisfied.\n\nMy task is to find the maximum possible profit by choosing heights for each spot that comply with all restrictions.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. It feels like a constraint satisfaction problem. For each spot, the height can't exceed h, but also, for any restriction that includes this spot, the height must not make the maximum in that restriction's range exceed x_i.\n\nWait, but since each restriction is a range and a max, each spot in that range can't have a height higher than x_i if it's the maximum in the range. Oh, no, wait: it's the maximum that matters. So for a given restriction l to r, the maximum height in that interval must be <= x_i. So, for all spots in l to r, their heights can be at most x_i, but maybe some are lower. Because the maximum is the key here.\n\nSo, for each spot, the height can't exceed h, and for any restriction that covers that spot, the height can't exceed the minimum of h and x_i for that restriction.\n\nWait, no. Because a spot could be covered by multiple restrictions. For example, spot i is in restriction A and B. Then, the height at i must satisfy both: the maximum in A's range (which includes i) is <= x_A, and the maximum in B's range (which includes i) is <= x_B.\n\nBut wait, for a spot i, the height a_i can be as high as possible, but it's constrained by the minimum of all x_j for any restriction j that covers i. Because if a_i is higher than any x_j for a restriction j that includes i, then that restriction would be violated because the maximum in j's range would be a_i, which is higher than x_j.\n\nSo, for each spot i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of x_j across all restrictions j where l_j <= i <= r_j, and also h. Because the x_j could be less than h, so the actual maximum is the smaller of those.\n\nWait, but what if a spot is not covered by any restriction? Then, the only constraint is h. So, the maximum height for i is min(h, min{x_j for all restrictions j covering i}).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each spot, the maximum possible height is the minimum of h and the minimum x of all restrictions that include this spot.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. For each spot i, compute the maximum allowed height a_i as the minimum between h and the minimum x among all restrictions that cover i.\n\nWait, but how do I compute for each spot the minimum x among all applicable restrictions?\n\nBecause for each restriction j, it affects all spots from l_j to r_j. So for a spot i, I need to collect all x_j where l_j <= i <= r_j, then take the minimum of those x_j's. Then, the maximum possible a_i is min(h, that minimum x_j). If there are no such x_j (i.e., no restrictions covering i), then a_i can be up to h.\n\nSo, the first step is to process all the restrictions and for each spot i, find the minimum x_j among all restrictions that include i. Let's call this value s_i. Then, the maximum height for i is min(s_i, h). But wait, no: if s_i is the minimum x_j across all restrictions that include i, then the maximum allowed is min(s_i, h). Because for each such restriction j, the a_i must be <= x_j. So the maximum a_i can be is the smallest x_j among those j's, or h if there are none.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if a spot is covered by multiple restrictions, the a_i must be <= x_j for each of those j. So the maximum a_i is the minimum of all x_j for those j's. But also, it can't exceed h. So yes, a_i is min(min_x_for_i, h), where min_x_for_i is the minimum x_j across all j that include i.\n\nSo, once we have a_i determined for each spot, the profit is sum(a_i^2 for all i).\n\nBut wait, is this correct? Because, for a restriction j, the maximum in l_j..r_j is the maximum a_i in that range. So, if any a_i in that range is greater than x_j, the restriction is violated.\n\nBut when we set a_i to be min(s_i, h), which is the minimum of x_j's for all j covering i, then for each j, the maximum a_i in l_j..r_j will be <= x_j. Because all a_i's are <= s_i, which is the minimum x_j for j covering i. So, in any restriction j, all a_i's in l_j..r_j are <= s_i <= x_j, so the maximum is <= x_j.\n\nYes, that works. So, the approach is to compute for each spot i, s_i as the minimum of x_j's for all restrictions j that include i. Then, a_i = min(s_i, h). Sum all a_i squared.\n\nWait, but what if two restrictions overlap on a spot i, and their x_j's are different. Like, for i=3, there's a restriction [2,4,5], and another [3,5,4]. So s_i for 3 is min(5,4)=4. So a_i can be up to 4.\n\nBut let's say, for a spot i, if it's included in multiple restrictions, the a_i is limited by the minimum x_j among them.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each spot i from 1 to n:\n   - Find all restrictions j where l_j <= i <= r_j.\n   - Compute s_i as the minimum x_j among these j's.\n   - a_i is min(s_i, h).\n   - Profit += a_i^2.\n\nBut wait, this might not work because the a_i's are set independently. But what if two spots are in overlapping ranges, and setting their a_i's based on their own s_i's doesn't violate any constraints?\n\nWait, the constraints are that for each restriction j, the maximum a_i in l_j..r_j must be <= x_j. So, if for each spot in l_j..r_j, a_i is <= x_j, then the maximum is also <= x_j. So as long as each a_i is <= x_j, the maximum is okay.\n\nBut in our approach, for each spot i, a_i is min(s_i, h). Where s_i is the min x_j across all j that cover i.\n\nSo, for each j, in l_j..r_j, all a_i's are <= s_i, which is the min x_j across all j's that include i. But s_i is <= x_j for all j that include i. So, for each j, in l_j..r_j, all a_i's are <= s_i <= x_j. Therefore, the maximum a_i in that range is <=x_j, so the restriction is satisfied.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n1. For each spot i, find all restrictions that include i (i.e., l_j <= i <= r_j).\n2. For each such restriction j, collect x_j.\n3. Compute s_i as the minimum of all x_j's collected in step 2.\n4. a_i is the minimum of s_i and h.\n5. The profit is the sum of squares of a_i's.\n\nSo, now the question is: how to implement this.\n\nFirst, read the input. We have n, h, m.\n\nThen, for each of the m restrictions, read l, r, x.\n\nWe can represent the restrictions as a list of tuples, perhaps.\n\nThen, for each spot i (from 1 to n), collect all x_j's from restrictions that include i. So for each i, loop through all restrictions and check if l_j <= i <= r_j. For those that do, collect x_j.\n\nOnce all x_j's are collected for i, s_i is the minimum of them, else h if none.\n\nWait, no. Because if no restrictions cover i, then s_i is undefined, but in that case, a_i is h.\n\nAlternatively, for each i, s_i is the minimum x_j among all restrictions that include i. If no such restrictions, s_i is infinity, so a_i is min(infinity, h) => h.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nInitialize an array s of size n+1 (since spots are 1-based?), but perhaps it's better to handle 0-based or 1-based accordingly.\n\nFor each i from 1 to n:\n\n   min_x = h  # default is h if no restrictions apply\n   for each restriction in restrictions:\n       l, r, x = restriction\n       if l <= i <= r:\n           if x < min_x:\n               min_x = x\n   s_i = min_x\n\na_i = min(s_i, h)\n\nSum a_i squared.\n\nWait, but wait: if no restrictions apply to i, then min_x remains h, so a_i is min(h, h) = h.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the algorithm is as described.\n\nNow, let's test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3 3\n1 1 1\n2 2 3\n3 3 2\n\nSo, n=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1: l=1, r=1, x=1\n\n2: l=2, r=2, x=3\n\n3: l=3, r=3, x=2\n\nProcessing each spot:\n\nSpot 1:\n\nCheck restrictions:\n\nOnly restriction 1 includes it. So x_j=1. min_x is 1.\n\ns_i=1.\n\na_i= min(1,3)=1.\n\nSpot 2:\n\nRestriction 2 includes it. x=3. min_x is 3.\n\ns_i=3. a_i=3.\n\nSpot3:\n\nRestriction3 includes it. x=2. min_x=2.\n\na_i=2.\n\nSum is 1 +9 +4=14. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n4 10 2\n2 3 8\n3 4 7\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n\nRestriction 1: 2<=i<=3, x=8.\n\nRestriction2: 3<=i<=4, x=7.\n\nFor each spot:\n\nSpot1:\n\nNo restrictions. So min_x is 10.\n\na_i=10.\n\nSpot2:\n\nIncluded in restriction1. x=8.\n\nmin_x=8. a_i=8.\n\nSpot3:\n\nIncluded in both restrictions. So x_j's are 8 and7. min is7.\n\na_i=7.\n\nSpot4:\n\nIncluded in restriction2. x=7. a_i=7.\n\nSo the heights are 10,8,7,7.\n\nProfit is 100 +64 +49 +49= 262. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nSo, now, the code.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nThen, read m lines, each with l, r, x. Store as a list of tuples.\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to n:\n\n   min_x = h\n\n   for each (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n\n       if l <=i <=r:\n\n           if x < min_x:\n\n               min_x =x\n\n   a_i = min(min_x, h)\n\n   add a_i^2 to the sum.\n\nFinally, print the sum.\n\nWait, but in the code, the spots are 1-based, right? Because the input uses 1-based l and r.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nrestrictions = []\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    restrictions.append( (l, r, x) )\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    min_x = h  # default is h if no restrictions apply\n\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n\n        if l <= i <= r:\n\n            if x < min_x:\n\n                min_x = x\n\n    a = min(min_x, h)\n\n    total += a*a\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if x is zero? Well, according to the input constraints, x_i can be zero. So, if a spot is in a restriction with x_i=0, then a_i can be zero.\n\nWhich is allowed.\n\nSo, this code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nAfter processing, the code correctly calculates 14.\n\nSecond sample: 262.\n\nWhat about a case where a spot is covered by multiple restrictions with varying x's.\n\nE.g., n=2, h=5, m=2.\n\nRestriction1: 1 2 3.\n\nRestriction2: 1 2 4.\n\nSo, for spot1:\n\nx_j's are 3 and4. min is 3.\n\na_i=3.\n\nSpot2: same, min is3.\n\nTotal is 9+9=18.\n\nWhich is correct because the maximum for both is 3, which satisfies both restrictions.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, h=5, m=2.\n\nRestriction1: 1 2 5.\n\nRestriction2: 1 2 3.\n\nSo, for each spot:\n\nmin x is 3.\n\na_i=3.\n\nTotal is 18.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=1, h=10, m=1.\n\nRestriction: 1 1 5.\n\nThen a_i=5. Profit is 25.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=1, h=10, m=0.\n\nThen a_i=10. Profit 100.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nI think this should handle all edge cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit possible from building houses on a street while adhering to given zoning restrictions. Each house can be built at a certain height, and the profit from each house is the square of its height. The goal is to maximize the total profit while respecting all constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem Constraints**: Each spot on the street can have a house with a height between 0 and a given maximum height `h`. Additionally, there are `m` restrictions where each restriction specifies a range of spots and a maximum height that can be built within that range.\n2. **Determine Maximum Height per Spot**: For each spot, the maximum allowed height is constrained by the minimum value of the maximum heights specified by all applicable restrictions. If a spot is not covered by any restriction, it can reach the full maximum height `h`.\n3. **Calculate Profit**: For each spot, compute the profit as the square of the determined maximum height and sum these values to get the total profit.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nrestrictions = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    min_x = h\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n        if l <= i <= r:\n            if x < min_x:\n                min_x = x\n    a = min(min_x, h)\n    total += a * a\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the number of spots `n`, the maximum height `h`, and the number of restrictions `m`. It then reads each restriction and stores them in a list.\n2. **Processing Each Spot**: For each spot from 1 to `n`, the code checks all restrictions to find the minimum maximum height allowed by those restrictions. This ensures that the height chosen for each spot does not violate any restriction.\n3. **Calculating Maximum Height**: The maximum height for each spot is the minimum of the computed restriction-based height and the overall maximum height `h`.\n4. **Computing Profit**: The profit from each spot is calculated as the square of its height, and these values are summed to get the total profit, which is then printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that all constraints are respected while maximizing the profit from the housing project.",
