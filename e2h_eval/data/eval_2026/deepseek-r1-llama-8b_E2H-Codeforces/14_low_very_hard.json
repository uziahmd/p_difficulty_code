He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where given a number of trailing zeros m, I have to find all the positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. Then, output the count of such n's and the numbers themselves in order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because there are always more multiples of 2 than 5, the number of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So, for each multiple of 5, we add one zero, but also for multiples of higher powers like 25, 125, etc.\n\nSo the formula for the number of trailing zeros Z(n) is:\nZ(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nThe task is, given m, to find all n such that Z(n) = m. And then return how many such n's exist and the list in order.\n\nWait, but how do I find these n's? Since Z(n) is a non-decreasing function, once it reaches m, it will stay at m or increase. But sometimes, it can jump over m, meaning no n satisfies Z(n) = m. Like if m is very large, perhaps.\n\nBut for our problem, the input m can be up to 100,000, which isn't too bad.\n\nI think the approach is to find the smallest n where Z(n) >= m, and then check how many consecutive n's have Z(n) equal to m.\n\nWait, no. Because Z(n) increases by 1 when n is a multiple of 5, but sometimes more. For example, when n is 25, Z(24) is floor(24/5) + floor(24/25) = 4 + 0 =4. Z(25)=5+1=6. So between 24 and 25, it jumps from 4 to 6. So m=5 would have no solution. That's why in the sample input where m=1, the output is 5 because 5! is 120 with one zero, and 6!,7!,8!,9! also have one zero. Wait, wait, no, wait: 5! has one zero, 6! has one (since 720 ends with one zero?), wait no, 5! is 120, one zero. 6! is 720, which also has one zero. Oh right, because 720 ends with one zero, not two. Wait, no, wait: 6! is 720, which has one zero. 7! is 5040, which also has one zero. 8! is 40320, which has one zero. 9! is 362880, which has one zero. 10! is 3628800, which has two zeros. So the numbers 5,6,7,8,9 all give Z(n)=1. So for m=1, the count is 5, and the numbers are 5-9.\n\nWait, so the way Z(n) works is that it can remain the same for multiple n's before increasing again. So the key is to find all the n's where Z(n) equals m.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For a given m, find the minimal n such that Z(n) = m.\n2. Then, find the maximal n such that Z(n) = m.\n3. The count is (max_n - min_n + 1).\n4. If there's no such n, then output 0.\n\nBut how do I find the minimal and maximal n's?\n\nWait, maybe I should use binary search to find the lower and upper bounds.\n\nYes, because Z(n) is a monotonic function. So for a given m, there might be a range [low, high] where Z(n) = m. We can find the first occurrence where Z(n) = m and the last occurrence.\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, the minimal n is the smallest n where Z(n) >= m and Z(n-1) < m. Similarly, the maximal n is the largest n where Z(n) <= m and Z(n+1) > m.\n\nWait, no. Because once Z(n) reaches m, it might stay at m for several n's. So the minimal n is the first n where Z(n) = m, and the maximal n is the last n where Z(n) = m.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nMaybe using binary search to find the lower bound and then check the next few numbers to find the upper bound.\n\nLet me think about the steps.\n\nFirst, write a helper function to compute Z(n).\n\ndef count_zeroes(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n =",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of \\( n \\) values that satisfy the given condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are always more multiples of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until \\( n \\) divided by the current power of 5 is zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) = m \\), we use binary search. Similarly, we extend the search to find the largest \\( n \\) where \\( Z(n) = m \\).\n\n3. **Counting Valid \\( n \\) Values**: Once the bounds are found, the count of valid \\( n \\) values is determined by the difference between the upper and lower bounds, inclusive.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeroes(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m  # Initial guess\n    while True:\n        cnt = count_zeroes(high)\n        if cnt < m:\n            low = high\n            high *= 2\n        elif cnt > m:\n            high //= 2\n        else:\n            break\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        c = count_zeroes(mid)\n        if c < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\ndef find_max_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while True:\n        cnt = count_zeroes(high)\n        if cnt < m:\n            low = high\n            high *= 2\n        elif cnt > m:\n            high //= 2\n        else:\n            break\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2\n        c = count_zeroes(mid)\n        if c <= m:\n            low = mid\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input().strip())\nmin_n = find_min_n(m)\nmax_n = find_max_n(m)\n\nif min_n > max_n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    k = max_n - min_n + 1\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(min_n, max_n + 1))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeroes Function**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) using the formula mentioned earlier.\n2. **find_min_n Function**: Uses binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) = m \\).\n3. **find_max_n Function**: Similarly, uses binary search to find the largest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) = m \\).\n4. **Main Logic**: Reads the input \\( m \\), computes the minimum and maximum \\( n \\) values, checks if they form a valid range, and prints the result accordingly.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, ensuring the solution is optimal even for large values of \\( m \\).",
