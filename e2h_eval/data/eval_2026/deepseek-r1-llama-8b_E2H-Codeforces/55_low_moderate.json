Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string — the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the lexicographically smallest possible string after performing a series of allowed swaps. The allowed swaps are only between adjacent '0's and '1's, or adjacent '1's and '2's. Hmm, right, so for example, I can swap '0' and '1' if they're next to each other, but not '0' and '2'. Similarly, '1' and '2' can be swapped, but '0' and '2' cannot.\n\nLet me think about what this means for the arrangement of characters. So, the key is that '0's can be reordered among themselves, and '1's can be reordered among themselves, but '0's cannot directly swap with '2's. Wait, but wait—can a '0' get past a '2' through some chain of swaps?\n\nWait, no. Because suppose we have '0', then '1', then '2'. The '0' and '1' can be swapped, making it '1','0','2'. Then, the '1' and '2' can be swapped, making '1','2','0'. But now, '2' and '0' are next to each other, but we can't swap them. So the '0' can't move past the '2' in this case. So that suggests that the relative order between '0's and '2's is fixed; you can't have a '0' moving past a '2' via these swaps.\n\nSo this implies that the order of '0's must come before '1's, which must come before '2's. Or wait, maybe not exactly, but perhaps certain groupings. Let me think: since '0's can't swap with '2's, any '0' that comes before a '2' in the original string will remain before all the '2's. Similarly, any '2' that comes before a '0' in the original string will stay there.\n\nWait, no, because '1's can be moved around. So perhaps the '0's can be rearranged among themselves, and the '2's can be rearranged among themselves, but their relative order with respect to each other is fixed based on the initial string. So for example, if the original string has a '0' followed by a '2', then after any number of swaps, that '0' will still come before that '2'. Similarly, if a '2' comes before a '0', then it remains so.\n\nSo the first thing I realize is that the relative positions of '0's and '2's are fixed. They can't cross each other. So when trying to find the lex smallest string, I need to arrange the '0's as early as possible, then the '1's, and then the '2's, but subject to the constraint that the order of '0's relative to '2's and vice versa is preserved.\n\nHmm. So the approach is to process the string, keeping track of the positions of '0's, '1's, and '2's, and then arrange them in such a way that all '0's come first, followed by '1's, followed by '2's, but without allowing '0's to come after '2's or '2's before '0's.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. For example, in the sample input '100210', the output is '001120'. Let me see why.\n\nOriginal string is '100210', which is 1,0,0,2,1,0.\n\nThe allowed swaps can move the '0's around each other, and the '1's around each other. The '2' is fixed in its position relative to the '0's and '1's. So the '2' is at position 4 (0-based index 3). So any '0's or '1's before that position can be rearranged, but those after can't cross over.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the output is '001120', which is 0,0,1,1,2,0. Oh, wait, the last character is 0, which was originally in position 5. So how did that happen? Because the '2' is at position 3, and the 0 at position 5 is after the '2'. So in the output, that 0 is moved to the end, but that would require moving it past the '2', which isn't allowed. So maybe my initial understanding is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing the sample. Let me look again.\n\nSample Input 1: '100210' → Output '001120'\n\nWait, the output is '001120' which is 0,0,1,1,2,0. But the original string is 1,0,0,2,1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing allowed adjacent swaps. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1' or '1' and '2', but not between '0' and '2'. This constraint means that '0's can only be rearranged among themselves, '1's among themselves, and '2's among themselves, but their relative order with respect to other digits cannot change.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Separate Characters**: We can separate the string into three groups: '0's, '1's, and '2's. The relative order of these groups cannot be changed because we cannot swap a '0' with a '2'.\n2. **Reconstruct the String**: To form the smallest lexicographical string, we arrange all '0's first, followed by all '1's, and then all '2's. This ensures the smallest possible order given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Separate the characters\nzeros = []\nones = []\ntwos = []\n\nfor c in s:\n    if c == '0':\n        zeros.append(c)\n    elif c == '1':\n        ones.append(c)\n    else:\n        twos.append(c)\n\n# Reconstruct the string\nmin_string = []\n# Add all zeros first\nmin_string += zeros\n# Then add ones\nmin_string += ones\n# Then add twos\nmin_string += twos\n\nprint(''.join(min_string))\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution works by first separating the input string into three lists based on the character values '0', '1', and '2'. Each list maintains the order of characters as they appear in the original string. By concatenating these lists in the order of '0's, '1's, and '2's, we ensure the resulting string is the lexicographically smallest possible under the given constraints. This approach efficiently handles the problem within linear time complexity, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 100,000 characters.",
