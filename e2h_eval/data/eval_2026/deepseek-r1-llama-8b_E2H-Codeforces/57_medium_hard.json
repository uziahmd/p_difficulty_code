His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about an Olympiad where participants' results from two tours are given. But the problem is that the teacher only has the points for each tour, not which participant got which. The teacher knows that Vasya's total (sum of his two scores) is at least x. We need to find the best and worst possible places Vasya could have gotten.\n\nHmm. So, the key here is to figure out all possible ways to pair the a_i and b_j such that their sum is at least x, and then determine how many participants have a higher or equal sum than Vasya's sum. Wait, no, because the participants are sorted by their total sum in descending order. So, the best place is when Vasya's sum is as high as possible, making him as high as possible in the rankings. The worst place is when his sum is as low as possible but still ≥x, which would make him as low as possible in the rankings.\n\nWait, no. Wait, to get the best possible rank, we want Vasya to have the maximum possible sum. Because that way, fewer people can have a higher sum than his. For the worst possible rank, we want his sum to be as low as possible (but still at least x), so more people could have a higher sum.\n\nSo the approach is: find the maximum possible sum Vasya could have, and the minimum possible sum he could have (but at least x). Then, for each of these sums, calculate how many participants have a higher sum, and thus determine his rank.\n\nBut wait, how do we pair the a's and b's? Because each a and b must be used exactly once, right? Because each participant is in both tours.\n\nSo, the first step is to compute all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) such that each a and b is used exactly once, and for each such pairing, compute the sum s = a_i + b_j. Then, among all these s values, Vasya's sum is one of them, and it's ≥x. We need to find, across all possible pairings, the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya.\n\nBut considering all possible pairings is computationally expensive, especially since n can be up to 105. So we need an efficient way to model this.\n\nWait, but for each possible way to assign the a's and b's into pairs, the sum s for each participant is determined by a permutation of the a's and b's. So for each a_i, it's matched with some b_j, and all are matched in a bijection.\n\nBut trying all possible permutations is O(n!) which is way too big for n=105.\n\nSo, we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about what determines the sum of each participant. Each participant's sum is a_i + b_σ(i), where σ is a permutation of the b array.\n\nWe need to find the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya's sum.\n\nBut perhaps we can model this as follows:\n\nTo find the best possible rank for Vasya:\n\n- We want his sum to be as large as possible. So, we need to maximize his sum while ensuring that the other participants' sums don't exceed his.\n\nWait, no. Because the best rank is determined by how many participants have a sum greater than his. So to minimize the count of those, we want his sum to be as large as possible.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst case, we want his sum to be as small as possible (≥x), which may allow more participants to have higher sums.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Find all possible pairs (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. For each possible pair, calculate the sum s_ij = a_i + b_j.\n\n2. For each possible s_ij, compute how many participants can have a sum greater than s_ij, given that the a's and b's are assigned in such a way that each is used exactly once.\n\nWait, but that's tricky because the assignment affects others.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nFor the best possible rank:\n\n- Assign the a's and b's such that Vasya's sum is as large as possible. So, choose the maximum possible s_ij that is >=x. Then, for this s_ij, how many participants can have a sum larger than s_ij.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because other participants might have higher sums even if Vasya's is high.\n\nAlternatively, to find the best possible rank, we can try to arrange the pairings such that as few as possible participants have a sum higher than Vasya's.\n\nHow to achieve that? Well, we can pair the largest a's with the largest b's, but that's not necessarily the case. Wait, maybe the optimal way to maximize Vasya's sum is to take the largest a and the largest b, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the best possible scenario for Vasya is when he has the maximum possible sum, and everyone else has a sum ≤ his sum.\n\nWait, but that's not always possible. For example, suppose someone else also has a very high sum.\n\nWait, no. Because the a's and b's are fixed. For instance, if a_i is the largest a, and b_j is the largest b, then s_ij is the maximum possible sum for any participant.\n\nSo, in that case, Vasya's sum can be set to this maximum, and then his best rank is 1.\n\nIn another case, maybe other participants can have sums equal to or higher than s_ij, but if Vasya takes the maximum, then his rank is 1.\n\nWait, yes. Because if Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, then he is at least tied for first place. Since the jury can assign the places arbitrarily among ties, his best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo, for the best possible rank, the maximum possible sum s is a_i + b_j for some i,j, and this sum is ≥x. Then, the best rank is 1.\n\nWait, but that's assuming that there exists a pairing where this s is achievable and that in that pairing, Vasya's sum is s_ij, and no one else has a sum >s_ij.\n\nBut wait, if Vasya's sum is the maximum possible across all possible pairings, then in any pairing, including the one where he has s_max, no one can have a sum higher than s_max. Therefore, his best rank is 1.\n\nSo, for the best possible rank, the maximum possible sum s that is ≥x is considered, and then the best rank is 1.\n\nWait, but perhaps the maximum sum is not achievable because the sum of a_i + b_j is less than x. But according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that there exists at least one i,j such that a_i + b_j >=x. So, in the best case, the maximum sum is achieved, and thus the best rank is 1.\n\nWait, let me test this idea against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n5 2\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nAll possible sums are 2. So, the best rank is 1, worst is 5.\n\nSample Output matches this.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nSecond sample:\n\nn=6, x=12.\n\na = [4,3,5,6,4,4]\nb = [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n\nWait, the second line is '6 7\\n...' Oh wait, the sample input is written as:\n\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\nWait, n=5 in the first case and 6 in the second?\n\nNo, the first line is 5 2, then 5 a's and 5 b's. Second line is 6 7, then 6 a's and 6 b's.\n\nSo in the second case, for the best possible rank, the maximum sum is a_i + b_j, which could be 5+8=13. So Vasya can have 13, and that's higher than all others, so rank 1.\n\nIn the worst case, perhaps the sum is 4+3=7, but others have higher sums.\n\nWait, but how is that arranged?\n\nWait, perhaps in the worst case, the other participants' sums are as high as possible, leaving Vasya's sum as low as possible.\n\nSo, for the worst possible rank:\n\nWe need to find the minimal possible sum s that is ≥x, and then compute how many participants have sums >s, which will give the worst possible rank.\n\nBut how to find this minimal s.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal s is the smallest possible sum that is >=x, and in the arrangement where as many other participants as possible have higher sums.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nCompute the maximum possible sum s_max (which is a_i + b_j, maximum over all i,j).\n\nThen, the best rank is 1.\n\nFor the worst possible rank:\n\nWe need to find the minimal s that is >=x, and then see how many participants can have a sum >s.\n\nBut how to compute this minimal s.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as follows:\n\nWe can pair the a's and b's such that as many participants as possible have sums greater than s, which is our chosen s for the worst case.\n\nSo, to minimize s (but s >=x), and arrange the pairings so that as many participants as possible have sums greater than s.\n\nThus, the worst rank is 1 plus the number of participants whose sum is greater than s.\n\nWait, but how to find s.\n\nThis seems tricky.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can generate all possible pairs (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x. For each such pair, compute the sum s_ij. Then, for each s_ij, compute the maximum possible number of participants that can have a sum >s_ij, given that a_i and b_j are paired accordingly.\n\nWait, but again, this seems computationally heavy for n=105.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps, to find the worst case, the minimal s is x. But that's not necessarily possible because some a_i + b_j could be x, but others could be higher. But if we can arrange the pairings so that as many participants as possible have sums higher than s, then s can be as low as possible.\n\nWait, but how.\n\nAnother thought: for each possible s (>=x), compute the minimal number of participants that must have a sum >s.\n\nWait, perhaps the worst case for Vasya is when his sum is s, and the number of participants with sum >s is as large as possible.\n\nSo, for each s >=x, compute the maximum possible number of participants that can have sum >s.\n\nThen, the worst rank is 1 + that number.\n\nBut how to compute this for all possible s >=x.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal s is x, but we can check whether it's possible to arrange the pairings so that the number of participants with sum >s is as large as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the worst case for Vasya is when his sum is as small as possible (but >=x), and as many other participants as possible have higher sums.\n\nSo, for each possible s that is >=x, we need to find the maximum number of participants that can have a sum >s, given that the pairings are done in a way that allows this.\n\nWait, but how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst case is when Vasya's sum is x, and all other participants have sums as high as possible.\n\nBut that's not necessarily the case, because perhaps you can't pair the a's and b's in a way that allows all others to have higher sums.\n\nWait, for example, if n=2, and a1=0, b1=5; a2=5, b2=0. x=5.\n\nThen, Vasya's sum could be either 5 or 5, so he's tied with the other participant. So the best rank is 1, worst is 2.\n\nBut according to the above logic, if s is 5, then the number of participants with sum>5 is zero, so rank is 1.\n\nBut wait, in reality, both have 5, so the worst rank is 2.\n\nSo, the initial approach is wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the problem is that when multiple participants have the same sum as Vasya, their ranks can vary depending on the jury's decision.\n\nSo, for the worst case, Vasya's sum is s, and the number of participants with sum >s is k. Then, the worst rank is 1 + k. Because in the worst case, the jury assigns Vasya the lowest possible position among those with sum s.\n\nSo, to find the worst possible rank, we need to find the minimal s >=x, and compute the maximum possible k (number of participants with sum >s), then the worst rank is 1 +k.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor the best possible rank:\n\n- The maximum possible sum s_max is a_i + b_j for some i,j, which is >=x. Then, the best rank is 1.\n\nFor the worst possible rank:\n\n- Find the minimal s >=x, and the maximum possible number of participants that can have a sum >s in some pairing. Then, the worst rank is 1 + that number.\n\nSo, now the question is how to compute for each possible s (>=x) the maximum possible k, which is the number of participants with sum >s.\n\nBut considering all possible s is difficult.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal s is x. So, if we can find a pairing where s =x, and as many participants as possible have sum >x, then that's the worst case.\n\nBut is it possible to arrange the pairings so that s =x for Vasya, and as many others as possible have sum >x.\n\nWait, but how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal s is x, but the maximum possible k is the number of participants that can have sum >x.\n\nSo, to compute this, we can:\n\n1. Find all possible s >=x.\n\n2. For each s, compute the maximum possible k, which is the maximum number of participants that can have sum >s, given that Vasya's sum is s.\n\nThen, the worst rank is 1 + k.\n\nBut how to compute k for a given s.\n\nWait, but for each s, to compute k, we need to pair the a's and b's such that as many participants as possible have sum >s, given that one participant (Vasya) has sum s.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nGiven s, can we pair the a's and b's in such a way that:\n\n- Exactly one participant has sum s.\n\n- As many other participants as possible have sum >s.\n\nSo, to compute this, for a given s, the algorithm would be:\n\n- Assign to Vasya a pair (a_p, b_q), such that a_p + b_q = s.\n\n- Then, for the remaining a's and b's, pair them in a way that maximizes the number of participants with sum >s.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nThe remaining a's and b's should be paired to maximize the number of participants with sum >s.\n\nSo, for each a_i (not a_p), pair it with a b_j such that a_i + b_j is as large as possible.\n\nBut we have to pair each a and b exactly once.\n\nSo, the strategy is:\n\n1. Choose a_p and b_q such that a_p + b_q = s.\n\n2. Then, pair the remaining a's and b's in a way that each a_i is paired with the largest possible b_j that hasn't been used yet, and a_i + b_j >s.\n\nWait, but this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given s, the maximum number of participants that can have sum >s is:\n\nmax_k = the number of a's and b's that can be paired such that a_i + b_j >s, given that a_p + b_q =s.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps to model this, we can:\n\n- Sort the a's in non-decreasing order.\n\n- Sort the b's in non-decreasing order.\n\nThen, for a given s, to find the maximum possible k, we can try to pair the a's and b's in a way that as many as possible pairs sum to >s.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given s, the maximum possible k is the number of a_i + b_j > s, considering that exactly one pair (a_p, b_q) sums to s, and the rest are paired in a way that maximizes the sum.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to find the maximum possible number of pairs that can be formed where a_i + b_j >s, and exactly one pair is s.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nThis seems challenging. Maybe I need to find a way to compute, for each s >=x, the maximum number of participants that can have a sum >s when Vasya's sum is s.\n\nAnother angle: For the worst case, we can try to make Vasya's sum as small as possible, i.e., s=x, and then find the maximum possible number of participants with sum >x.\n\nSo, for s=x, the maximum possible k is the maximum number of participants that can have sum >x, given that one participant has sum x.\n\nHow can we compute this?\n\nWe can proceed as follows:\n\n1. For each possible pair (a_p, b_q) where a_p + b_q =x, assign this to Vasya.\n\n2. Then, for the remaining a's and b's, pair them in a way that as many as possible have sum >x.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n- For each (p,q) where a_p + b_q =x:\n\n   a. Remove a_p and b_q from the lists.\n\n   b. Pair the remaining a's and b's to maximize the number of pairs with sum >x.\n\n   c. Compute the number of such pairs, add 1 (for Vasya) to get k.\n\n   d. Keep track of the maximum k across all (p,q) pairs.\n\nSo, the maximum possible k is the maximum number of participants that can have sum >x, plus 1 for Vasya.\n\nBut how to efficiently compute this for all possible (p,q) pairs.\n\nWait, but n is up to 105, so for each (p,q) pair, it's O(n^2), which is manageable.\n\nWait, but for each (p,q) pair, we have to process the remaining a's and b's, which is O(n) each time.\n\nWait, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a smarter way.\n\nAnother approach: After choosing (p,q) such that a_p + b_q =x, the remaining a's and b's can be paired in a way that as many as possible have sum >x.\n\nThis can be done by sorting the a's and b's in decreasing order and pairing them greedily.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nSort a's in non-decreasing order, and sort b's in non-decreasing order.\n\nWait, no, perhaps we should sort them in non-increasing order.\n\nBecause to maximize the number of pairs with sum >x, we can pair the largest a with the largest b, and so on.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nAfter removing a_p and b_q, sort the remaining a's in non-decreasing order, sort the remaining b's in non-decreasing order.\n\nThen, pair the largest a with the largest b, next largest a with next largest b, etc., counting how many pairs have sum >x.\n\nWait, but maybe this isn't the optimal way. Because sometimes pairing a smaller a with a larger b could yield more pairs with sum >x.\n\nBut perhaps the greedy approach of pairing largest a with largest b is sufficient to maximize the count.\n\nI'm not entirely sure, but for the purposes of solving this problem, let's proceed with this approach.\n\nSo, the steps for the worst case are:\n\nFor each possible (p, q) where a_p + b_q >=x:\n\n   - Assign Vasya to (p, q), sum s = a_p + b_q.\n\n   - Now, remove a_p and b_q from the a and b lists.\n\n   - Sort the remaining a's in non-decreasing order, and the same for the b's.\n\n   - Then, pair the largest a with the largest b, the next largest with next largest, etc.\n\n   - Count how many of these pairs have sum >s.\n\n   - The current k is this count +1 (Vasya's position).\n\n   - Keep track of the maximum k across all possible (p,q).\n\nBut wait, in the worst case, we want to minimize s, which is why we should consider s=x, but perhaps for some (p,q), a_p + b_q is larger than x, but in that case, maybe we can get a better (worse) k.\n\nWait, but for the worst case, s should be as small as possible, because a smaller s allows more participants to have sum >s, leading to a worse rank.\n\nSo, for the worst case, we need to find the minimal s >=x, and then compute the maximum possible k for that s.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- Find all possible s >=x.\n\n- For each s, compute the maximum possible k, which is the maximum number of participants that can have sum >s when Vasya's sum is s.\n\n- Among all s >=x, select the s with the minimal value (since that gives the worst case), and the corresponding k.\n\n- The worst rank is 1 +k.\n\nBut how to find all possible s >=x.\n\nAn alternative approach is to find the minimal s >=x, which is x itself, but perhaps there are no (p,q) pairs that sum to x.\n\nIn that case, s would have to be the minimal sum >=x that is achievable.\n\nBut the problem says that it's guaranteed that Vasya was present, so there exists at least one pair (p,q) with a_p +b_q >=x.\n\nSo, the minimal s is the minimal sum achievable by any (p,q) pair with a_p +b_q >=x.\n\nSo, for the worst case, we need to find the minimal s >=x, and for that s, compute the maximum possible k.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Find all possible s that can be formed by any (p,q) pair, where s >=x.\n\n2. Among these s, find the minimal s (call it s_min).\n\n3. For s_min, find the maximum possible k, which is the maximum number of participants that can have sum >s_min when Vasya's sum is s_min.\n\n4. The worst rank is 1 +k.\n\nSo, now, the problem reduces to:\n\n- Find s_min.\n\n- For s_min, compute the maximum possible k.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this efficiently.\n\nImplementing step 1: find all s >=x.\n\nBut for n=105, the number of possible s is up to 2*105=210, so it's manageable.\n\nWait, but for n=105, the maximum a_i is 105, and b_j is 105, so maximum s is 210.\n\nSo, the possible s values are limited, so we can precompute all possible s and track the minimal s >=x.\n\nOnce s_min is found, proceed to compute k.\n\nSo, first, find s_min.\n\nImplementing step 2: compute k.\n\nTo compute k for s_min, we need to find the maximum number of participants that can have sum >s_min when Vasya's sum is s_min.\n\nSo, for each possible (p,q) where a_p +b_q =s_min:\n\n   a. Remove a_p and b_q.\n\n   b. Sort the remaining a's in non-decreasing order.\n\n   c. Sort the remaining b's in non-decreasing order.\n\n   d. Pair them in a way that as many pairs as possible have sum >s_min.\n\n      i. How? One approach is to pair the largest available a with the largest available b, then next largest, etc.\n\n      ii. Count how many such pairs have sum >s_min.\n\n   e. The current k is count +1.\n\n   f. Keep track of the maximum k across all (p,q) pairs.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple (p,q) pairs that sum to s_min? We need to try each possible (p,q) pair, compute k for each, and find the maximum k.\n\nSo, the code would be something like:\n\nInitialize max_k =0.\n\nFor each p in 0..n-1:\n\n   for each q in 0..n-1:\n\n       if a[p] + b[q] == s_min:\n\n           create copies of a and b, remove a[p] and b[q].\n\n           sort the remaining a's in non-decreasing order.\n\n           sort the remaining b's in non-decreasing order.\n\n           count_pairs =0\n\n           i=0, j=0\n\n           while i < len(a_sorted) and j < len(b_sorted):\n\n               if a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[j] > s_min:\n\n                   count_pairs +=1\n\n                   i +=1\n\n                   j +=1\n\n               else:\n\n                   # move to next in a or b\n\n                   if a_sorted[i] > b_sorted[j]:\n\n                       i +=1\n\n                   else:\n\n                       j +=1\n\n           # Also, handle cases where one list is exhausted but the other has remaining elements.\n\n           # For example, if i reached end, then all j's can form pairs with the remaining a's? No, because after i is at end, j is also at end, since we've paired as much as possible.\n\n           # So, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\n           i = j =0\n\n           count =0\n\n           while i < len(a_sorted) and j < len(b_sorted):\n\n               if a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[j] > s_min:\n\n                   count +=1\n\n                   i +=1\n\n                   j +=1\n\n               else:\n\n                   if a_sorted[i] <= b_sorted[j]:\n\n                       i +=1\n\n                   else:\n\n                       j +=1\n\n           # After this loop, some a's or b's may remain unpaired.\n\n           # However, in the context of the problem, each a and b must be paired, so perhaps the loop ensures that.\n\n           # Or perhaps not, but for the purpose of maximizing count, we can ignore the unpaired ones, as they cannot contribute to count.\n\n           current_k = count +1\n\n           if current_k > max_k:\n\n               max_k = current_k\n\nSo, for each (p,q) that sums to s_min, compute count_pairs as above, and keep the maximum current_k.\n\nOnce all (p,q) are tried, the maximum_k is the maximum possible k.\n\nThen, the worst rank is 1 + max_k.\n\nWait, but how to find all (p,q) pairs that sum to s_min.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Collect all possible s values from a_p +b_q for all p, q.\n\n2. Find s_min as the minimal s >=x.\n\n3. Collect all (p,q) pairs where a_p +b_q ==s_min.\n\n4. For each such (p,q), compute the count as described.\n\n5. The maximum count across all (p,q) is the maximum possible k.\n\n6. The worst rank is 1 +k.\n\nBut wait, what if no (p,q) pair sums to s_min? Then, s_min is larger than the minimal possible s that can be achieved, but that's impossible because s_min is the minimal possible s >=x.\n\nWait, no. Because s_min is the minimal s >=x that is achievable by any (p,q) pair.\n\nSo, for s_min, there must be at least one (p,q) pair.\n\nSo, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, let's outline the overall steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead a and b arrays.\n\nCompute all possible s = a_p + b_q for p, q in 0..n-1.\n\nCollect all s >=x. If none, but the problem says there is at least one, so proceed.\n\nFind s_min as the minimal s in this collection.\n\nNow, collect all (p,q) pairs where a_p +b_q ==s_min.\n\nFor each (p,q) in this list:\n\n   Create a copy of a and b.\n\n   Remove a_p and b_q.\n\n   Sort the remaining a's in non-decreasing order.\n\n   Sort the remaining b's in non-decreasing order.\n\n   Initialize i=0, j=0, count=0.\n\n   While i < len(a_sorted) and j < len(b_sorted):\n\n       if a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[j] > s_min:\n\n           count +=1\n\n           i +=1\n\n           j +=1\n\n       else:\n\n           if a_sorted[i] <= b_sorted[j]:\n\n               i +=1\n\n           else:\n\n               j +=1\n\n   current_k = count +1\n\n   update max_k if necessary.\n\nAfter processing all (p,q), the worst rank is 1 + max_k.\n\nBut wait, this approach may not capture all possible (p,q) pairs that sum to s_min, because for each (p,q), the a_p and b_q may vary, and the way to pair the remaining a and b may vary, leading to different counts.\n\nSo, we have to try all possible (p,q) pairs that sum to s_min and find the maximum count.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut handling all possible (p,q) pairs is O(n^2) which is acceptable for n=105.\n\nSo, the code steps are:\n\nRead n, x.\n\nRead a as list.\n\nRead b as list.\n\nCompute all possible s.\n\ns_list = [a[p] + b[q] for p in range(n) for q in range(n)]\n\ns_candidates = [s for s in s_list if s >=x]\n\nif not s_candidates:\n\n   # but problem says Vasya exists, so this is impossible.\n\ns_min = min(s_candidates)\n\n# Now, collect all (p,q) pairs that sum to s_min.\n\npairs = []\n\nfor p in range(n):\n\n   for q in range(n):\n\n       if a[p] + b[q] == s_min:\n\n           pairs.append( (p, q) )\n\nmax_k =0\n\nfor (p, q) in pairs:\n\n   # Make copies of a and b.\n\n   a_copy = a.copy()\n\n   b_copy = b.copy()\n\n   a_copy.pop(p)\n\n   b_copy.pop(q)\n\n   # Sort a_copy in non-decreasing order.\n\n   a_copy.sort()\n\n   # Sort b_copy in non-decreasing order.\n\n   b_copy.sort()\n\n   i = j = 0\n\n   count =0\n\n   while i < len(a_copy) and j < len(b_copy):\n\n       if a_copy[i] + b_copy[j] > s_min:\n\n           count +=1\n\n           i +=1\n\n           j +=1\n\n       else:\n\n           if a_copy[i] <= b_copy[j]:\n\n               i +=1\n\n           else:\n\n               j +=1\n\n   current_k = count +1\n\n   if current_k > max_k:\n\n       max_k = current_k\n\nworst_rank = 1 + max_k\n\nFor the best rank, as discussed earlier, it's always 1.\n\nSo, the output is best_rank=1, worst_rank=1 + max_k.\n\nWait, but wait! Is that always the case?\n\nIn the first sample, the best rank is 1, which makes sense.\n\nIn the second sample, the best rank is 1, which is correct.\n\nBut what about other cases?\n\nSuppose n=2, a = [0, 10], b = [10, 0], x=10.\n\nPossible s_candidates are 10 and 20.\n\ns_min is 10.\n\nThe pairs are (0,0): a[0]+b[0]=10, and (1,1): a[1]+b[1]=10.\n\nFor each pair:\n\nCase 1: p=0, q=0.\n\nRemaining a: [10], b: [0].\n\nPair 10 and 0: sum is 10, which is not >10. So count=0.\n\ncurrent_k=0+1=1.\n\nCase 2: p=1, q=1.\n\nRemaining a: [0], b: [10].\n\nPair 0 and 10: sum is 10, not >10. So count=0.\n\ncurrent_k=1.\n\nSo, max_k is 1.\n\nSo, worst rank is 2.\n\nWhich is correct, because in the worst case, Vasya's sum is 10, and the other has 10, so he can be last.\n\nBut in this case, the best rank is 1.\n\nSo, the code correctly computes this.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3, a=[1, 2, 3], b=[3, 2, 1], x=5.\n\nPossible s values:\n\n1+3=4, 1+2=3, 1+1=2,\n\n2+3=5, 2+2=4, 2+1=3,\n\n3+3=6, 3+2=5, 3+1=4.\n\ns_candidates >=5 are 5,5,6,5,5,6.\n\ns_min is 5.\n\nThe pairs that sum to 5 are:\n\n(1,2) (a=2, b=3?), wait indexes are 0-based.\n\nWait, a is [1,2,3], indexes 0,1,2.\n\nb is [3,2,1], indexes 0,1,2.\n\nSo:\n\na[0] + b[1] =1+2=3 <5.\n\na[0] + b[2] =1+1=2 <5.\n\na[1] + b[0] =2+3=5.\n\na[1] + b[1] =2+2=4 <5.\n\na[1] + b[2] =2+1=3 <5.\n\na[2] + b[0] =3+3=6.\n\na[2] + b[1] =3+2=5.\n\na[2] + b[2] =3+1=4 <5.\n\nSo the pairs are (1,0), (2,1).\n\nSo for each pair:\n\nCase 1: p=1, q=0.\n\nRemaining a: [1,3], b: [2,1].\n\nSort a: [1,3], sort b: [1,2].\n\nPair 1+1=2 <=5 → move a to next.\n\n1+2=3 <=5 → move b to next.\n\n3+1=4 <=5 → move a to next (no more a's). So count remains 0.\n\ncurrent_k=0+1=1.\n\nCase 2: p=2, q=1.\n\nRemaining a: [1,2], b: [3,1].\n\nSort a: [1,2], sort b: [1,3].\n\nPair 1+1=2 <=5 → move a.\n\n1+3=4 <=5 → move b.\n\n2+1=3 <=5 → move a.\n\nSo count remains 0.\n\ncurrent_k=1.\n\nSo, the maximum k is 1, so worst rank is 2.\n\nBut wait, in reality, is there a way to have Vasya's sum 5 and others have higher sums?\n\nIn this case, the other participants have sums 6 and 5.\n\nWait, in case 1, after removing a[1] and b[0], the remaining a's are 1 and 3, and b's are 2 and 1.\n\nWhen sorted, a is [1,3], b is [1,2].\n\nPair 1+1=2, then 3+2=5. Both are <=5. So count is 0.\n\nBut in the other case, when we have a[2] and b[1], remaining a is [1,2], b is [3,1]. So sorted a is [1,2], b is [1,3].\n\nPair 1+1=2, 2+3=5. Both are <=5.\n\nSo, in this case, the worst rank is 2.\n\nBut what's the actual situation.\n\nIn this case, when Vasya's sum is 5, the other participants can have sum 6 and 5.\n\nSo, the other participant with sum 6 is higher than 5, so Vasya's rank is 2.\n\nBut is there a way to have more participants with sum >5?\n\nIn this case, no, because the other participants can have at most 6 and 5.\n\nSo, the code correctly finds that the worst rank is 2.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle this correctly.\n\nThus, the plan is solid.\n\nNow, let's proceed to write the code.\n\nFirst, read the inputs.\n\nBut note that the input is given as a single string with lines separated by newlines.\n\nSo, in Python, reading from stdin:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\nb = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nThen, compute all possible s.\n\ns_list = []\nfor p in range(n):\n    for q in range(n):\n        s = a[p] + b[q]\n        s_list.append(s)\n\ns_candidates = [s for s in s_list if s >= x]\n\nif not s_candidates:\n    # According to problem statement, this won't happen.\n    pass\n\ns_min = min(s_candidates)\n\npairs = []\nfor p in range(n):\n    for q in range(n):\n        if a[p] + b[q] == s_min:\n            pairs.append( (p, q) )\n\nmax_k = 0\n\nfor (p, q) in pairs:\n    a_copy = a.copy()\n    b_copy = b.copy()\n    a_copy.pop(p)\n    b_copy.pop(q)\n    a_copy.sort()\n    b_copy.sort()\n    \n    i =",

The solution involves finding the maximum and minimum possible sums of his scores and then determining how many participants could have higher scores than him in each case.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - Vasya's total score is the sum of his points from two tours.\n   - We need to find the best and worst possible ranks considering all possible pairings of participants' scores.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Best Rank**: The best rank is achieved when Vasya's score is as high as possible. This is simply the highest possible sum of any participant's scores from the two tours.\n   - **Worst Rank**: The worst rank is determined by the lowest possible sum Vasya can have while still meeting or exceeding the minimum required score. This involves maximizing the number of participants who could have a higher score than Vasya.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Compute all possible sums of scores from the two tours.\n   - Identify the minimum sum (s_min) that is at least the given minimum score (x).\n   - For each possible pairing that results in s_min, compute how many other participants can have a higher sum than s_min.\n   - The worst rank is determined by the maximum number of participants with higher sums plus one for Vasya.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    # Generate all possible sums\n    s_list = []\n    for p in range(n):\n        for q in range(n):\n            s = a[p] + b[q]\n            s_list.append(s)\n    \n    # Find candidates s >=x\n    s_candidates = [s for s in s_list if s >= x]\n    s_min = min(s_candidates)\n    \n    # Collect all (p, q) pairs where a[p] + b[q] == s_min\n    pairs = []\n    for p in range(n):\n        for q in range(n):\n            if a[p] + b[q] == s_min:\n                pairs.append( (p, q) )\n    \n    max_k = 0\n    \n    for (p, q) in pairs:\n        # Create copies and remove the selected elements\n        a_copy = a.copy()\n        b_copy = b.copy()\n        a_copy.pop(p)\n        b_copy.pop(q)\n        a_copy.sort()\n        b_copy.sort()\n        \n        i = j = count = 0\n        while i < len(a_copy) and j < len(b_copy):\n            if a_copy[i] + b_copy[j] > s_min:\n                count += 1\n                i += 1\n                j += 1\n            else:\n                if a_copy[i] <= b_copy[j]:\n                    i += 1\n                else:\n                    j += 1\n        \n        current_k = count + 1\n        if current_k > max_k:\n            max_k = current_k\n    \n    best_rank = 1\n    worst_rank = 1 + max_k\n    \n    print(f\"{best_rank} {worst_rank}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of participants, the minimum score, and the scores from the two tours.\n2. **Generating Possible Sums**: We compute all possible sums of scores from the two tours to determine valid candidates.\n3. **Finding Minimum Valid Sum**: The minimum valid sum (s_min) is identified to use for determining the worst rank.\n4. **Pairing Scores**: For each valid pairing resulting in s_min, we simulate the scenario where Vasya's score is s_min and calculate how many other participants can have higher scores.\n5. **Calculating Worst Rank**: The worst rank is derived by finding the maximum number of participants who can have higher scores than s_min, plus one for Vasya.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine both the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya based on the given constraints and scores.",
