The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$. Print the number of such pairs modulo $$$mod$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lex smaller than q, and the number of inversions in p is greater than in q. And then output this count modulo a given mod value.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. The constraints are n up to 500, which isn't too bad, but I need an efficient solution. Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, permutations p and q. For each pair (p, q), two conditions must hold:\n1. p is lex smaller than q.\n2. inversion(p) > inversion(q).\n\nI need to count all such pairs.\n\nLet me break it down. The total number of possible pairs is (n!)^2. But I can't iterate through all possible pairs for n=500 since 500! is way too big. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, maybe I can model this with dynamic programming or combinatorics. Let's think about what defines a permutation's lex order and its inversion count.\n\nLex order: p is lex smaller than q if, at the first position where they differ, p has a smaller number than q. So for example, if p = [1,3,2] and q = [1,4,2], p is lex smaller because the second element is 3 < 4.\n\nInversion count: the number of pairs (i,j) where i < j and p[i] > p[j]. So for p = [3,2,1], the inversion count is 3*(3-1)/2 = 3, as every pair is an inversion.\n\nNow, the key is to find for each permutation p, how many permutations q are there such that:\n- q is lex greater than p.\n- inversion(q) < inversion(p).\n\nThen, summing over all p gives the answer.\n\nBut even that seems tricky because for each p, I'd need to know the number of q's that satisfy both conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute some information about all permutations and combine them.\n\nWait, maybe I can precompute for all possible inversion counts and lex orders. But again, for n=500, even that might be challenging.\n\nAnother angle: think about the relation between the lex order and inversion counts. Is there any known relationship or property that could help here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into counting for each permutation p, the number of q's that are lex greater and have fewer inversions than p.\n\nSo, for each p, the number of such q's is equal to the sum over k < inv(p) of the number of permutations q with inversion count k and q > p in lex order.\n\nBut even that seems complicated. How can I efficiently compute this for each p?\n\nHmm. Let's think about the structure of permutations. Maybe we can group permutations based on their inversion counts and lex order.\n\nWait, but the lex order and inversion count are two different measures. They aren't directly related in an obvious way.\n\nWait, perhaps we can find for each permutation p, the minimal number of inversions that a permutation q must have to be considered. Or perhaps, find for each permutation p, the number of q's that are lex larger and have inversion count less than p's.\n\nBut again, for n=500, enumerating all permutations isn't feasible.\n\nWait, another thought: the lex order and inversion count are both properties that can be handled using dynamic programming. Perhaps we can model the state based on these two aspects.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think differently.\n\nWhat's the total number of pairs where p < q in lex order? That's simply the sum over all p < q. But the condition on inversion counts complicates things.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be approached by considering that for a pair (p, q), p < q implies that p differs from q at the first differing position by having a smaller element. So perhaps, for such p and q, the inversion counts can be compared.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's possible to find that for certain structures of p, the number of q's that satisfy the inversion condition can be computed more easily.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for some combinatorial identity or inclusion-exclusion principle that can help here.\n\nAnother idea: consider that for each permutation q, the number of p's that are lex smaller than q and have more inversions than q. Summing this over all q would give the desired count.\n\nSo the problem becomes: for each q, count the number of p < q (lex) such that inversion(p) > inversion(q). Then sum over all q.\n\nThis might be easier because for each q, I can consider all p's that are lex smaller than q, and count how many of them have higher inversion counts.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nFor each q, the set of p's that are lex smaller than q",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lexicographically smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than the number of inversions in q. The result should be returned modulo a given value.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves using dynamic programming to efficiently compute the required counts without enumerating all possible permutations, which would be computationally infeasible for large n. The key steps are:\n\n1. **Inversion Count Calculation**: Precompute the inversion counts for all permutations using dynamic programming.\n2. **Lexicographical Order Handling**: For each permutation, maintain a count of permutations that are lexicographically smaller and have a higher inversion count.\n3. **Dynamic Programming State**: Use a DP state where `dp[i][k]` represents the number of permutations of length i with exactly k inversions. This helps in efficiently computing the necessary counts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    MOD = 10**9 +7\n    n, mod = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    max_inv = n*(n-1)//2\n\n    # Precompute factorial and inverse factorial modulo mod\n    fact = [1]*(n+1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        fact[i] = fact[i-1]*i % mod\n\n    # Compute dp table: dp[i][j] = number of permutations of length i with j inversions\n    dp = [[0]*(max_inv +1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    dp[1][0] = 1\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(max_inv +1):\n            if j ==0:\n                dp[i][j] = fact[i]\n            else:\n                for k in range(j):\n                    if k <= max_inv - i:\n                        dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][k]\n                        dp[i][j] %= mod\n                dp[i][j] %= mod\n\n    # Now, for each permutation, compute the number of q's > p lex and less inversion\n    # But instead, we can precompute for each inversion count and permutation structure\n    # We'll use another DP where we track for each permutation type, the count of lex smaller ones with higher inversions.\n\n    # We need to consider all possible permutations p and for each, count q's > p lex and inv(q) < inv(p).\n    # So, we can model this by considering the first position where p and q differ.\n\n    # Let's think about the structure where we process the first differing position between p and q.\n\n    # For each possible position i (from 0 to n-1), and for each possible value v at that position,\n    # compute the contributions based on whether p has a value less than q's value at i.\n\n    # However, this approach might be too complex.
