His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about an Olympiad where participants' results from two tours are given. But the problem is that the teacher only has the points for each tour, not which participant got which. The teacher knows that Vasya's total (sum of his two scores) is at least x. We need to find the best and worst possible places Vasya could have gotten.\n\nHmm. So, the key here is to figure out all possible ways to pair the a_i and b_j such that their sum is at least x, and then determine how many participants have a higher or equal sum than Vasya's, which would affect his rank.\n\nWait, but the participants are in arbitrary order. So, the a list is the first tour points, but we don't know which corresponds to which participant. Same with the b list. So, we need to consider all possible permutations of pairing a's and b's, but that's computationally impossible because n can be up to 105, leading to factorial possibilities.\n\nWait, no. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The a and b lists are given as separate arrays, but each a_i is the score of some participant in the first tour, and each b_j is the score of the same participant in the second tour. But the problem says that the a and b are given in arbitrary order. So for each participant, their a and b are somewhere in the a and b arrays, but not necessarily aligned by index.\n\nSo, the actual approach is to find a way to pair each a_i with a b_j such that each a_i is paired with exactly one b_j, and each participant is represented once. Because each participant took both tours, so each a_i and b_j must be used exactly once each.\n\nBut since the lists are given in arbitrary order, we don't know which a corresponds to which b. So, the problem is to find the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya, considering all possible valid pairings.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that each participant participated in both tours. So, the a and b arrays contain the points for each participant in each tour, but in arbitrary order. So for each possible permutation of matching a's to b's, we can form the total for each participant, and then compute their rank.\n\nBut trying all possible permutations is computationally impossible when n is 105.\n\nSo, that approach isn't feasible. Therefore, I need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about what determines Vasya's rank. For the best case, he should have the maximum possible sum, so that as few others have higher sums as possible. For the worst case, he should have the minimum possible sum, but still >=x, and as many others have higher sums as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is:\n\nIn the best case scenario for Vasya, his sum is as high as possible, while others' sums are as low as possible. But no, wait: the sum of others depends on how we pair a and b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible pairing, we can compute the sum for each participant, sort them, and find Vasya's position. But again, with n=105, this is impossible.\n\nWe need another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the a and b arrays can be paired in any way, but each a_i must be paired with exactly one b_j, and vice versa.\n\nWait, but what's the condition for a valid pairing? Each a and b must be used exactly once. So, each a_i is matched to a unique b_j.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding all possible matchings between a and b, compute the sum for each participant, and then determine Vasya's rank based on these sums.\n\nBut again, n=105 is too big for this approach.\n\nSo, perhaps we need to find the minimal and maximal possible number of participants who have a sum greater than or equal to Vasya's sum.\n\nWait, but since Vasya's sum is at least x, but could be any value >=x, depending on how we pair a and b. So, to find the best possible rank, we want to make Vasya's sum as high as possible, while making as few others have sums >= his sum.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst possible rank, we want to make Vasya's sum as small as possible (but >=x), while maximizing the number of others with sums >= his.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think differently. Since the a and b are given, but in any order, the problem allows us to pair them in any way as long as each a is used once and each b is used once.\n\nSo, for each possible pairing, we can calculate the sum for each participant, and then compute Vasya's rank.\n\nBut since the pairing can be any permutation, perhaps we can model the problem by considering all possible pairings and find the best and worst possible positions.\n\nBut again, this seems computationally intensive.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mathematical way to model this without enumerating all possibilities.\n\nLet me think about the best possible rank.\n\nIn the best case, Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and as few other participants as possible have a sum higher than or equal to his.\n\nTo maximize his sum, we can pair the largest a with the largest b, but that might not always be optimal. Alternatively, perhaps we can choose for Vasya a pair (a_p, b_q) such that a_p + b_q is maximized, and then arrange the rest of the pairs to minimize the number of participants with sum >= a_p + b_q.\n\nWait, but the arrangement of the rest affects the number of participants with sum higher than Vasya's.\n\nSo, for the best case:\n\n- Choose the maximum possible sum s for Vasya, s >=x.\n- Then, for the remaining participants, arrange their a and b in such a way that as few as possible have sum >=s.\n\nBut how do we find s and the corresponding minimal count of participants with sum >=s?\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible s is the maximum a_i + b_j for all i,j. But we can't necessarily have that because each a and b can be used only once.\n\nWait, but if Vasya's sum is a_i + b_j, then all other participants must have a and b assigned from the remaining a's and b's.\n\nHmm.\n\nThis seems tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the best possible rank, we can arrange the a and b in such a way that Vasya has the highest possible sum, and the other participants have as low as possible sums.\n\nWait, perhaps to achieve the best rank, we can try to pair the largest a with the largest b, the second largest a with the second largest b, etc., except for Vasya's pair.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of sorted a and b arrays.\n\nWait, let's sort a in non-decreasing order and b in non-decreasing order.\n\nThen, the maximum sum is achieved when we pair the largest a with the largest b. But that's just a thought.\n\nBut perhaps for the best case, we can pair the largest a with the largest b, the next largest with the next, etc., and see what sum Vasya can get.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily correct because perhaps another pairing gives a higher sum for Vasya.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way to maximize Vasya's sum is to take the maximum a plus maximum b, but ensuring that this sum is >=x.\n\nWait, but the problem states that Vasya exists, so there's at least one pair (i,j) where a_i +b_j >=x.\n\nSo, for the best case, perhaps the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum a_i + maximum b_j. But then, is it possible for Vasya to have that sum?\n\nOnly if there's a way to pair those two a and b, and the rest can be paired in a way that doesn't conflict.\n\nWait, but if a and b are in any order, then yes, we can choose to pair the max a with max b for Vasya.\n\nWait, perhaps the best case is when Vasya's sum is the maximum possible sum of a and b, and the rest of the pairings are arranged so that as few as possible have higher sums than Vasya.\n\nSo, for the best possible rank, Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and others' sums are as low as possible.\n\nSo, the steps for best rank:\n\n1. Find all possible a_i + b_j >=x, choose the maximum possible s.\n\n2. Then, for the remaining participants, pair the a's and b's in a way that minimizes the number of participants whose sum is >=s.\n\nWait, but how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best possible rank is determined by how many participants can have a sum >=s, where s is Vasya's sum.\n\nBut to minimize the number of such participants, after choosing s as large as possible, we need to arrange the remaining a and b to form as few sums >=s as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of participants with sum >=s is determined by the number of pairs (a_k, b_l) where a_k + b_l >=s, minus 1 (since Vasya is counted once).\n\nBut how do we arrange the pairings to achieve this minimal number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best possible rank is 1 (if Vasya can have the maximum sum) plus the number of participants that can have sum >=s.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck.\n\nLet me think about the example given.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nn=5, x=2.\n\na = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nb = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nEach possible pairing will give each participant a sum of 2.\n\nSo, regardless of how they are paired, all have sum 2. So, in the best case, Vasya can be first, and in the worst case, last.\n\nSo, the output is 1 5.\n\nIn the second sample:\n\nn=6, x=12.\n\na is [4,3,5,6,4,4] → sorted: 3,4,4,4,5,6.\n\nb is [8,6,0,4,3,4] → sorted:0,3,4,4,6,8.\n\nWait, in the best case, Vasya's sum is 4+8=12, which is the maximum possible.\n\nAnd the other participants' sums are arranged to be as small as possible.\n\nSo, in this case, the other participants' sums are 3+3=6, 4+4=8, etc.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should look at the sample note.\n\nIn the note, the best case is when Vasya has 12 points, and others have lower.\n\nSo, for the best rank, Vasya is first.\n\nFor the worst case, he has a sum of 7 (4+3=7), and others have higher sums.\n\nWait, in that case, how many participants have sum >=7?\n\nLooking at the example, in the worst case, Vasya's sum is 7, and others have sums 8,8,10, etc.\n\nSo, how many participants have sum >=7? It's possible that 5 participants have higher sums than him.\n\nSo, his rank is 6th, but in the output it's 5th. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the output for the second sample is '1 5'.\n\nHmm, perhaps the worst case is when Vasya has sum 7, and 4 other participants have higher sums, so his rank is 5th.\n\nWait, let me think: if Vasya has 7, and four others have 8 or higher, then he is fifth.\n\nSo, the worst rank is 5.\n\nSo, the problem is to find, for all possible pairings, the minimal and maximal possible ranks of Vasya.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nThe best possible rank is 1 if Vasya's sum can be made the maximum possible, and the worst is n if all others have higher sums.\n\nBut how to find whether it's possible for Vasya to have the maximum possible sum.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible sum for any participant is the sum of the maximum a and maximum b.\n\nBut in the sample, the maximum a is 6, maximum b is 8, sum is 14, which is higher than x=12. So why isn't the best rank 1 in that case?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Oh, because in the first sample, all participants have sum 2, but Vasya can be first or last.\n\nSo, the key is that the sum is not fixed; it depends on how a and b are paired.\n\nSo, to find the best possible rank for Vasya, we can pair the a and b in such a way that Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and the others' sums are as low as possible.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst case, Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but >=x), and others' sums are as high as possible.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. For the best case:\n   - Find the maximum possible sum s that Vasya can have (s >=x).\n   - Then, arrange the remaining a and b to form as few sums >=s as possible.\n\n2. For the worst case:\n   - Find the minimum possible sum s that Vasya can have (s >=x).\n   - Arrange the remaining a and b to form as many sums >=s as possible.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding s for the best and worst cases, and then computing how many participants can have sums >=s.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think about the best case.\n\nThe maximum possible s is the maximum a_i + b_j, but that's only possible if we can pair a_i and b_j, and assign the rest in a way that no other sum exceeds s.\n\nWait, but that may not be possible because some a's and b's could add up to more than s.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother approach: For the best possible rank, we can try to pair Vasya with the maximum possible sum, and then pair the remaining a's and b's in a way that the sum of each pair is as small as possible.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is 1 plus the number of pairs where a_i + b_j > s, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best possible rank is determined by how many participants can have a sum higher than Vasya's sum.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the best case is when Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and the number of participants with sum >= Vasya's sum is as small as possible.\n\nSo, to find the maximum possible s for Vasya, which is the maximum possible a_i + b_j, but also ensuring that the remaining a and b can be paired in such a way that no other participant has a sum >=s.\n\nWait, but how can that happen? Because after taking a_i and b_j, the remaining a's and b's could form sums that are larger than s.\n\nFor example, suppose a has 5, and b has 5, and Vasya takes a_i=5 and b_j=5, s=10. Then the remaining a's and b's are 4 and 4, which sum to 8 <10. So in this case, Vasya's rank is 1.\n\nBut if the a's are [6,3], b's are [4,5], and x is 11.\n\nVasya's maximum s is 6+5=11. Then the remaining a's are 3 and b's 4. Their sum is 7 <11. So Vasya is first.\n\nBut if a's are [5,5], b's [5,5], and x is 10. Then Vasya can take 5+5=10. The others also have 5+5=10. So Vasya's rank can be first, second, etc., depending on the jury's decision.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the jury can arrange ties as they like. So for the best case, Vasya can be first, even if others have the same sum.\n\nSo, in that case, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\nBest case:\n\nFind the maximum possible sum s that Vasya can have, which is the maximum a_i + b_j, and see if it's possible to pair the remaining a's and b's in such a way that no sum >=s exists.\n\nIf yes, then the best rank is 1.\n\nOtherwise, we need to find how many participants have sum >=s.\n\nWait, but how to determine if it's possible to pair the remaining a and b to have all sums <s.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best case is when Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, and then the rest have sums less than or equal to that.\n\nBut how to find this.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in descending order. Then, pair the largest a with the smallest b, etc., but that's probably not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to find the maximum possible sum s for Vasya, which is the maximum a_i + maximum b_j, and then check if the sum of the next largest a and the next largest b is <= s.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's see.\n\nAnother idea: To maximize Vasya's sum, we can pair the largest a and the largest b. Then, for the rest, pair the next largest a with the next largest b, etc. This would result in the maximum possible sum for Vasya and the minimal possible for others.\n\nWait, but in this case, others could have sums equal to or larger than Vasya's sum, depending on the pairing.\n\nBut perhaps if a is sorted in ascending order, and b is sorted in descending order, and then paired accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps to maximize Vasya's sum, we can pair the largest a with the largest b, the next largest a with the next largest b, and so on. Then, the sum for Vasya is a_n + b_n.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way is to try to pair a and b in a way that Vasya's sum is as large as possible, and then for the remaining a's and b's, pair them in a way that their sums are as small as possible.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n1. Sort a in non-decreasing order.\n\n2. Sort b in non-decreasing order.\n\n3. Pair a[0] with b[-1], a[1] with b[-2], etc., in a greedy way that maximizes Vasya's sum.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the best case, we can pair the largest a and largest b for Vasya, then for the remaining a's and b's, pair them in a way that their sum is as small as possible.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Find the maximum possible s where a_i + b_j = s, and s >=x.\n\n- Then, for the remaining a and b, pair them in such a way that their sum is as small as possible. So, the minimal number of participants with sum >=s is 0, making Vasya's rank 1.\n\nBut how to verify if this is possible.\n\nWait, but sometimes, after pairing Vasya, the remaining a and b may have to be paired in such a way that some sums are >=s.\n\nFor example, suppose a = [5,4], b=[5,4]. If Vasya takes 5 and 5, s=10. Then the remaining are 4 and 4, which sum to 8 <10. So Vasya is first.\n\nAnother example: a = [6,3], b = [4,5]. Suppose Vasya takes 6 and 5 (sum 11). Remaining a is 3 and b is 4, sum 7 <11. So Vasya is first.\n\nBut what if a = [5,5], b = [5,5]. Vasya takes 5+5=10. Others have 5+5=10. So, even though Vasya's sum is 10, others also have 10. So, the best rank is 1, and the worst is 2.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the jury can arrange the ties as they like. So, in the best case, Vasya can be first.\n\nSo, perhaps the best possible rank is 1, provided that Vasya's sum is the maximum possible.\n\nBut how to confirm that.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is:\n\nFor the best possible rank, find the maximum possible s that Vasya can have, which is the maximum a_i + b_j, and then check if all other possible pairs sum to less than s.\n\nWait, but that's not possible in general.\n\nWait, perhaps not. For example, suppose a = [3,2], b = [2,3]. Maximum s is 5 (3+2 or 2+3). But pairing 3 and 3 would give sum 6, which is higher than 5. So, it's not possible for Vasya to have s=5, because the other pair would sum to 6>5.\n\nSo, in that case, the maximum s is 5, but others can have 6. So Vasya's best rank is 2.\n\nWait, but wait: the a and b are [3,2] and [2,3], respectively.\n\nIf we pair 3 with 3, that's 6. But that's only possible if we have a pair of 3 and 3. But in the a array, there's only one 3, and in the b array, only one 3.\n\nSo, in this case, the maximum s is 5 (3+2 or 2+3). But in that case, the other pair would be 2+3=5 or 3+2=5, so in either case, all have sum 5. So, Vasya's sum is 5, and others also have 5. So, the best rank is 1, worst is 2.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum s is not always achievable in a way that others have sums <s.\n\nThus, to determine whether Vasya can have the maximum possible s, and whether others can have sums <s, we need to find if, after pairing Vasya's a and b, the remaining a and b can be paired in such a way that all sums are <= s-1.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to compute for the best case:\n\nSort a in non-decreasing order and b in non-increasing order.\n\nPair a[i] with b[j], starting from the end.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way to maximize Vasya's sum is to pair the largest a with the largest b, the next largest a with the next largest b, and so on, but leave the smallest a and b for Vasya.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way is to pair the largest a with the largest b, then the next largest a with the next largest b, etc., and then assign the smallest a and b to Vasya.\n\nNo, that would minimize Vasya's sum.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to pair the largest a with the smallest b, the next largest a with the next smallest b, etc., to maximize the sum.\n\nWait, but I'm getting stuck.\n\nLet me think about the problem differently. Since the pairing can be done in any way, perhaps the minimal and maximal possible rank can be determined by the following:\n\nBest case:\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible s such that s >=x, and s is the sum of some a_i and b_j.\n\nThen, for the remaining a's and b's, we need to pair them in a way that as few as possible have sum >=s.\n\nWait, but how to model this.\n\nPerhaps for the best case, the maximum possible s is the maximum a_i + b_j, but if that's possible.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example where a = [3,2], b = [2,3], the maximum a_i + b_j is 5 (3+2=5, 2+3=5). But then, after pairing, the other pair is 2+3=5, which equals s. So, in that case, Vasya's sum is 5, and others have 5. So, the best rank is 1, as the jury can place him first.\n\nBut what about a case where after pairing Vasya, the others can have sums higher than s.\n\nLike a = [5,4], b = [6,3].\n\nMax s is 5+6=11.\n\nThen, the remaining a is 4, b is 3. Sum is 7 <11. So, Vasya's sum is 11, others have 7. So, best rank is 1.\n\nAnother example: a = [4,3], b = [5,4].\n\nMax s is 4+5=9. Remaining a is 3, b is 4. Sum is 7 <9. So, Vasya is first.\n\nAnother case: a = [5,5], b = [5,5]. Max s is 10. Others have 5+5=10. So, Vasya can be first.\n\nSo, perhaps the best case is always 1.\n\nWait, but what if a = [5,4], b = [6,5].\n\nThen, max s is 5+6=11. Remaining a is 4, b is5. Sum is 9 <11. So, Vasya is first.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, perhaps the best case is always 1.\n\nWait, but what if a = [5,3], b = [5,4].\n\nMax s is 5+5=10.\n\nRemaining a is 3, b is4. Sum is 7 <10. So, Vasya is first.\n\nSo, perhaps the best case is always 1, as long as Vasya can have the maximum sum.\n\nBut what about when the maximum sum is achievable for multiple participants.\n\nFor example, a = [3,3], b = [3,3]. All possible pairings give sum 6.\n\nSo, Vasya can be first, or second, etc. But the best case is 1.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo, perhaps the best case is always 1.\n\nWait, but what about the sample where n=5, x=2, and all a and b are 1.\n\nSo, the sum is 2 for everyone. So, the best possible rank is 1, and the worst is 5.\n\nSo, in that case, the best case is 1.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps the best case is always 1.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya's sum is at least x. So, perhaps the maximum s is the maximum a_i + b_j, but only if that s >=x.\n\nSo, the best case is 1 if the maximum s is >=x.\n\nOtherwise, it's impossible because the problem states that Vasya was present and his sum is >=x.\n\nWait, the problem says that it's guaranteed that there exists i and j such that a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nSo, in the best case, we can assume that the maximum s is >=x.\n\nSo, for the best case, the rank is 1.\n\nBut wait, what about when the maximum s is achievable for multiple participants, but the rest can have sums >=s.\n\nLike, a = [5,5], b = [5,5]. So, all possible pairings have sum 10.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is 1, because the jury can choose to put Vasya first.\n\nSo, perhaps the best possible rank is always 1.\n\nSo, perhaps the best case is to output 1.\n\nWait, but what about the sample where the best case is 1 and the worst is 5.\n\nSo, the code can have best_rank =1.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nNow, for the worst case.\n\nIn the worst case, Vasya's sum is as small as possible (>=x), and as many others as possible have sums >= Vasya's sum.\n\nSo, to find the worst possible rank, we need to find the minimal possible s that is >=x, and then arrange the remaining a and b to form as many participants with sum >=s.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n1. Find the minimal possible s >=x that can be formed by any a_i + b_j.\n\n2. Then, arrange the remaining a and b in such a way that as many participants as possible have sum >=s.\n\nSo, how to find s.\n\nThe minimal s is the minimal a_i + b_j that is >=x.\n\nWait, no. Because perhaps there are multiple a_i + b_j that are >=x, but the minimal among them is s_min.\n\nBut then, perhaps s can be s_min, but then, the number of participants with sum >=s_min can be as high as possible.\n\nBut how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst case is when Vasya's sum is as small as possible (>=x), and the others are as large as possible.\n\nSo, to find s as the minimal possible sum >=x, and then arrange the remaining a and b into pairs with sum >=s.\n\nSo, the steps for worst case:\n\n1. Find all possible a_i + b_j >=x.\n\n2. Choose s as the minimal possible sum (s_min) among these.\n\n3. Then, pair the remaining a and b in a way that as many as possible have sum >=s_min.\n\nSo, how to find the maximum number of participants with sum >=s_min.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the worst case is when Vasya's sum is s_min, and all other participants have sum >=s_min.\n\nBut that's not always possible.\n\nFor example, in the sample where a and b are all 1, the worst case is when Vasya has sum 2, and all others have sum 2.\n\nSo, in that case, the rank is n (5), but the problem's sample output is 5.\n\nWait, but the sample output shows that the worst rank is 5.\n\nSo, in that case, the worst case is when Vasya is last.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nWait, perhaps the worst possible rank is the number of participants whose sum is >=s_min, including Vasya.\n\nBecause in the worst case, Vasya's sum is s_min, and all others have sum >=s_min, so the rank is (number of participants with sum >=s_min).\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, in the sample where a and b are all 1, all participants have sum 2, so the worst case is 5th place.\n\nWhich is indeed n.\n\nSo, perhaps the worst possible rank is the maximum between the number of participants with sum >=s_min and 1.\n\nWait, but in the case where some participants have sum <s_min, but others >=s_min.\n\nBut in the worst case, we arrange the pairings so that as many participants as possible have sum >=s_min.\n\nSo, the worst case is when the number of participants with sum >=s_min is as large as possible.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- Find s_min, the minimal possible sum >=x.\n\n- Then, find the maximum possible number of participants (including Vasya) that can have sum >=s_min.\n\n- That maximum number is the worst possible rank.\n\nSo, how to compute this.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think about the sample where a and b are all 1.\n\ns_min is 2.\n\nThen, all participants have sum 2.\n\nSo, the maximum number is 5.\n\nSo, the worst rank is 5.\n\nAnother example: a = [4,3,5,6,4,4], b = [8,6,0,4,3,4].\n\nIn the worst case, Vasya's sum is 7 (4+3=7), and others have higher sums.\n\nWait, but how.\n\nWait, in the note, in the worst case, Vasya's sum is 4+3=7, and others have 8,8, etc.\n\nSo, how many participants have sum >=7? Let's see.\n\nIn the worst case scenario:\n\nThe table is {4:8,4:6,6:4,5:4,4:3,3:0}.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, perhaps the worst case is when Vasya has sum 7, and others have sums 8,8, etc.\n\nSo, how many have sum >=7.\n\nLet's see:\n\nParticipant 1: 4+8=12 >=7.\n\nParticipant 2:4+6=10 >=7.\n\nParticipant3:6+4=10 >=7.\n\nParticipant4:5+4=9 >=7.\n\nParticipant5:4+3=7 >=7.\n\nParticipant6:3+0=3 <7.\n\nSo, participants 1,2,3,4,5 have sum >=7. So, total of 5 participants.\n\nSo, the worst rank is 5.\n\nSo, the worst possible rank is 5.\n\nSo, the question is, how to find s_min and the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=s_min.\n\nSo, to model this:\n\ns_min is the minimal sum that can be formed by any a_i + b_j, which is >=x.\n\nOnce s_min is found, the next step is to determine the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=s_min.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the way is to find the maximum possible k such that there exists a way to pair a and b such that at least k participants have sum >=s_min.\n\nBut how to find this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible k is the number of a_i + b_j >=s_min, but this is not necessarily correct.\n\nWait, for example, in the sample where a and b are all 1, the number of participants with sum >=2 is 5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: a = [5,4], b = [6,3].\n\ns_min is 4+3=7.\n\nWait, no, because 5+3=8 >=x, and 4+6=10 >=x, but s_min is 5+3=8, which is the minimal sum >=x.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no, s_min is the minimal sum >=x. So, in this case, if x is 7, then 5+3=8 is the minimal sum >=7.\n\nSo, s_min=8.\n\nNow, how many participants can have sum >=8.\n\nWe can pair 5 and 3: sum 8.\n\nBut the remaining a is 4 and b is6: sum 10 >=8.\n\nSo, both participants have sum >=8. So, the maximum number is 2.\n\nThus, the worst rank is 2.\n\nSo, the worst case is when Vasya's sum is 8, and the other participant's sum is 10. So, rank is 2.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the other participant's sum is 10, which is higher than 8.\n\nSo, Vasya is second.\n\nSo, the worst rank is 2.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is:\n\nCompute s_min as the minimal sum >=x.\n\nThen, find the maximum possible number of participants that can have sum >=s_min.\n\nThis can be done by pairing the a's and b's in a way that as many as possible have sum >=s_min.\n\nSo, how to compute this.\n\nIdea:\n\nSort a in non-decreasing order.\n\nSort b in non-decreasing order.\n\nThen, for the worst case, we can pair the smallest a with the largest possible b, and so on, to maximize the number of pairs with sum >=s_min.\n\nWait, perhaps.\n\nWait, perhaps for the worst case, the way to maximize the number of participants with sum >=s_min is to pair the smallest a with the largest possible b, the next smallest a with the next largest b, etc., as long as their sum >=s_min.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Find s_min as the minimal a_i + b_j >=x.\n\n2. Sort a in non-decreasing order.\n\n3. Sort b in non-increasing order.\n\n4. For each i, check if a[i] + b[i] >=s_min. If yes, count it as a participant with sum >=s_min.\n\n5. The maximum number of such participants is the worst possible rank.\n\nBut wait, perhaps this isn't correct.\n\nWait, in the sample where a = [5,4], b = [6,3], x=7.\n\ns_min is 8.\n\nAfter sorting a: [4,5], sorted in non-decreasing.\n\nb sorted in non-increasing: [6,3].\n\nPair 4 with6: sum 10 >=8 → count 1.\n\nPair5 with3: sum 8 >=8 → count 2.\n\nSo, the maximum number is 2.\n\nWhich matches our earlier example.\n\nAnother example: a = [3,2], b = [2,3], x=5.\n\ns_min is5.\n\nAfter sorting a: [2,3], b sorted non-increasing: [3,2].\n\nPair 2+3=5 >=5 → count 1.\n\nPair3+2=5 >=5 → count 2.\n\nSo, the worst case is 2.\n\nWhich makes sense, as all participants have sum 5, so the worst rank is 2.\n\nAnother example: a = [4,3,5,6,4,4], b = [8,6,0,4,3,4], x=12.\n\ns_min is12.\n\nWait, but looking for a_i + b_j >=12.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\na",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his scores from two tours. The key is to consider all possible valid pairings of participants' scores from the two tours.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: \n   - To find the best possible rank, we aim for Vasya to have the highest possible score. This is achieved by maximizing his total score while ensuring it is at least `x`. The best rank is always 1 because the jury can place Vasya first even if others have the same score.\n\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**:\n   - For the worst possible rank, we minimize Vasya's total score while ensuring it is at least `x`. We then maximize the number of participants who have a higher or equal score than Vasya. This involves finding the smallest possible sum `s_min` that is at least `x` and then determining the maximum number of participants who can have sums greater than or equal to `s_min`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    # For best case, Vasya can be first\n    print(\"1\", end=' ')\n    \n    # For worst case, find minimal s >=x and compute how many can have sum >= s\n    min_sum = float('inf')\n    for ai in a:\n        for bj in b:\n            s = ai + bj\n            if s >= x and s < min_sum:\n                min_sum = s\n    \n    # Now, sort a in non-decreasing order and b in non-increasing order\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b, reverse=True)\n    \n    count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[i] >= min_sum:\n            count += 1\n    print(count, end='')\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Best Rank Calculation**: The best rank is always determined to be 1 because Vasya can be placed first by the jury regardless of others' scores.\n- **Worst Rank Calculation**: \n  - We first find the minimum possible sum `s_min` that is at least `x` by iterating through all possible pairs of scores from the two tours.\n  - Next, we sort the scores in such a way to maximize the number of participants with sums greater than or equal to `s_min`. By sorting one list in ascending order and the other in descending order, we can efficiently check how many pairs meet the condition.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the best and worst possible ranks using optimal pairing strategies.",
