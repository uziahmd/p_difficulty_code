Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form .

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find three vertices in a regular n-gon that form an angle as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the polygon is regular, which means all sides and angles are equal. So each internal angle can be calculated. Wait, right, for a regular n-gon, each internal angle is ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. But wait, no, that's the internal angle of the polygon itself. But when considering the angles formed by three points, it's about the angles between two lines drawn from a common vertex.\n\nWait, the problem says that v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides. So the angle is at v2, with one side being from v2 to v1 and the other from v2 to v3. So we're looking for such a configuration where the angle is as close as possible to 'a' degrees.\n\nI think I need to model the possible angles that can be formed by choosing any three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 in order around the polygon. Then, among all these possible angles, find the one that's closest to 'a', and if there's a tie, pick any.\n\nBut wait, how do I calculate the possible angles? Since the polygon is regular, the positions of the vertices can be considered on a unit circle. Each vertex is spaced 360/n degrees apart.\n\nLet me think: the angle at v2 depends on the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2. Suppose the polygon is numbered 1 to n in clockwise order. So v2 has two adjacent vertices, say v_prev and v_next. The points v1 and v3 must lie on the sides connected to v2, meaning the sides are from v2 to v_prev and from v2 to v_next. So wait, no, because the sides are the edges of the polygon. Oh, but the problem says that v1 and v3 lie on the sides of the angle at v2. So maybe the sides are the two edges connected to v2. Because in a polygon, each vertex is connected to two others via edges.\n\nSo for example, in a square (n=4), the sides connected to vertex 2 are 2-1 and 2-3. So any v1 and v3 must be either 1 or 3, or maybe other points that lie on those sides. Wait, no, because the polygon is convex, and the sides are straight lines. So the only points on the sides of the angle at v2 are the two adjacent vertices, right?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe v1 and v3 are on the two sides (edges) connected to v2. So for vertex v2, the two adjacent vertices are prev and next. So the possible choices for v1 and v3 are any points on the edge from v2 to prev and any point on the edge from v2 to next. But since the polygon is regular and convex, the edges are straight lines. So any point on the edges would lie along the line segments.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that v1, v2, v3 must be distinct and lie on the polygon. So I think that the only possible candidates for v1 and v3 are the adjacent vertices of v2, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle can be formed by any three points, but the angle is measured at v2, and the lines from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3 form the angle. So the angle is determined by the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So for any triplet (v1, v2, v3), the angle at v2 is the angle between the vectors v2v1 and v2v3. So the angle can vary depending on the positions of v1 and v3 around the polygon.\n\nSo the key is to compute, for each possible v2, the possible angles formed by pairs of other vertices, and find the triplet that gives the angle closest to 'a'.\n\nHmm, but how to model this efficiently.\n\nGiven that n can be up to 105, trying all possible triplets would be O(n^3), which for n=105 is about 1e6, which is manageable. Because 105^3 is 1,157,625 operations, which is acceptable for Python.\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\n1. Iterate over each possible v2 (from 1 to n).\n2. For each v2, iterate over all possible pairs of other vertices (v1, v3) that are not v2 and not equal to each other.\n3. For each triplet (v1, v2, v3), calculate the angle at v2.\n4. Keep track of the triplet(s) that have the minimal absolute difference between the computed angle and 'a'.\n5. Once all triplets are processed, output the triplet with the smallest difference. If multiple, any can be chosen.\n\nBut calculating the angle for each triplet might be computationally expensive if done naively. Wait, but perhaps there's a mathematical way to compute the angle based on their positions on the polygon.\n\nSince the polygon is regular, each vertex can be placed on the unit circle. Let's assign each vertex a position angle θ, where θ = 360/(n) * (i-1) degrees, assuming the polygon is numbered 1,2,...,n in clockwise order.\n\nFor example, in a square (n=4), vertex 1 is at 0 degrees, vertex 2 at 90, vertex 3 at 180, vertex 4 at 270.\n\nSo for a given v2, its position is at θ_v2 = 360*(v2-1)/n degrees.\n\nThen, for v1 and v3, their positions are θ_v1 and θ_v3.\n\nThe angle at v2 is the angle between the vectors from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\nWait, but since the polygon is regular and the points are on a circle, the angle at v2 can be found by the difference in the arcs.\n\nIn a circle, the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice the angle subtended at any point on the circumference. But wait, no, that's only for certain cases. Alternatively, the angle at a point on the circumference between two other points depends on the arcs.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3, but considering the direction.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. In a circle, the angle at a point on the circumference is equal to half the measure of the central angle between the two points. But that's when the two points are on the same side relative to the point. But when they are on opposite sides, it's the larger angle.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle at v2 is the minimum of the two possible arcs between v1 and v3, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this mathematically. Let's consider the circle where the polygon is inscribed. Each vertex is at an angle θ_i = 2π(i-1)/n radians.\n\nFor a given v2, the angle between v1 and v3 is determined by the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2.\n\nWait, the angle at v2 is the angle between the vectors from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\nBut since all points are on the circumference of a circle, the angle at v2 can be found using the properties of the circle.\n\nAnother approach: for three points A, B, C on a circle, the angle at B is equal to half the measure of the arc AC that does not contain B. Or wait, it's half the measure of the arc that's opposite to B.\n\nWait, I remember that the inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.\n\nSo, in our case, the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc from v1 to v3 that does not pass through v2.\n\nWait, because the inscribed angle depends on the arc that is opposite to it.\n\nSo, let's compute the central angle between v1 and v3. Then, the inscribed angle at v2 would be half that, but only if v2 is not on the minor arc between v1 and v3. Or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the angle between the two vectors from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3.\n\nLet me model this.\n\nEach vertex's position is at angle θ_i = 360*(i-1)/n degrees.\n\nFor v2, the angle is θ_v2 = 360*(v2-1)/n.\n\nFor v1, θ_v1 = 360*(v1-1)/n.\n\nFor v3, θ_v3 = 360*(v3-1)/n.\n\nThen, the vectors from v2 to v1 is θ_v1 - θ_v2.\n\nSimilarly, the vector from v2 to v3 is θ_v3 - θ_v2.\n\nBut wait, that's in terms of their positions. However, the actual angle between the two vectors depends on the difference in their positions, but since all points are on a circle, it's the difference modulo 360.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle between the two vectors is |(θ_v1 - θ_v2) - (θ_v3 - θ_v2)|, but that's not correct because the angle between two vectors is the absolute difference of their directions, but considering the shortest path.\n\nWait, no. The angle between two vectors is the absolute difference in their angles, but since the vectors are directed, the angle could be the acute or obtuse angle between them. So the angle between them is the minimum of the absolute difference and 360 minus that difference.\n\nBut in our case, since the polygon is regular and convex, the angle at v2 will be the smaller angle between the two vectors.\n\nSo, the angle between the two vectors is the absolute difference in their angles, but considering that the polygon is circular.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute the central angle between v1 and v3, then the inscribed angle at v2 is half of that, but only if v2 is not on the minor arc between v1 and v3.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have three points on a circle: A, B, C. The angle at B is the inscribed angle that intercepts the arc AC. The measure of that angle is half the measure of the arc AC that doesn't contain B.\n\nSo, if the arc AC is less than 180 degrees, then the angle at B is half of it. If the arc AC is greater than 180, then the angle is half of 360 minus arc AC.\n\nWait, no. Because the inscribed angle can be either acute or reflex, but in the case of a convex polygon, the angle at a vertex is less than 180 degrees.\n\nSo, for a regular polygon, which is convex, the angle at any vertex is less than 180 degrees.\n\nTherefore, for the problem, the angle at v2 is always less than 180 degrees.\n\nSo, for the angle at v2, it's equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not pass through v2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the arc AC (between A and C) that does not contain B is the one that's intercepted by the angle at B. So the measure of that arc is equal to twice the angle at B.\n\nSo, the angle at B is (arc length without B) / 2.\n\nSo, in our case, for the given v2, the angle is (arc_length(v1, v3) without v2) / 2.\n\nSo, to compute the angle at v2, we can compute the arc length between v1 and v3, which is the minimal path along the circle between them, and then subtract the distance from v2 to the closer end of the arc.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's clarify.\n\nLet me think: the arc between v1 and v3 can be measured in two ways, the short way and the long way. The inscribed angle at v2 depends on which arc is considered.\n\nIf the arc that doesn't contain v2 is shorter, then the angle is half of that. Otherwise, it's half of the longer arc.\n\nWait, no. The inscribed angle theorem says that the angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So, the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to the angle.\n\nSo, in the case where the points are ordered v1, v2, v3 around the circle, the arc from v1 to v3 that doesn't include v2 is the one that is intercepted by the angle at v2. So the measure of that arc is 2 * angle_v2.\n\nSo, the angle at v2 is (arc_length) / 2, where arc_length is the measure of the arc from v1 to v3 that doesn't contain v2.\n\nSo, to compute the angle at v2, we need to find the arc length between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2, then divide by 2.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet's consider the positions of v1, v2, v3 on the circle.\n\nLet me arrange the points in the order they appear on the circle, considering the polygon is regular and convex.\n\nWe can represent each vertex as a point on a circle, ordered in a clockwise direction.\n\nSo, for each triplet (v1, v2, v3), we can determine the order of these points on the circle.\n\nAssuming the polygon is labeled 1, 2, ..., n in clockwise order, each vertex's position is 360*(v-1)/n degrees.\n\nLet me denote the positions as angles in [0, 360).\n\nSo, for each v, pos[v] = (v-1)*360/n degrees.\n\nNow, for a given v2, we can compute pos_v2.\n\nWe need to find the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2.\n\nSo, the arc is the one that's on the opposite side of v2.\n\nTo compute the arc length between v1 and v3 not containing v2, we can:\n\n1. Compute the distance from v1 to v3 going clockwise, which is (pos_v3 - pos_v1) mod 360. Let's call this cw_dist.\n\n2. Similarly, the distance going counter-clockwise is (pos_v1 - pos_v3) mod 360, which is the same as 360 - cw_dist.\n\n3. The minimal arc is min(cw_dist, 360 - cw_dist).\n\n4. Now, determine whether v2 lies on the minimal arc between v1 and v3.\n\n   a. If yes, then the intercepted arc that doesn't contain v2 is the major arc (360 - minimal_arc). So the angle at v2 is (major_arc) / 2.\n\n   b. If no, then the intercepted arc is the minimal_arc, and the angle is minimal_arc / 2.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-express:\n\nThe intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2. So, if the minimal arc between v1 and v3 contains v2, then the intercepted arc is the major arc, which is larger.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the intercepted arc is the one that doesn't contain v2. So if the minimal arc between v1 and v3 passes through v2, then the intercepted arc is the other way around.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think: the intercepted arc is the one that doesn't contain v2. So, if v2 is on the minor arc between v1 and v3, then the intercepted arc is the major arc (which is 360 - minor_arc). Otherwise, it's the minor arc.\n\nSo, to find the intercepted arc, we can compute:\n\n- The minor arc between v1 and v3 is m = min(cw_dist, 360 - cw_dist).\n\n- Check if v2 is on that minor arc.\n\nIf v2 is on the minor arc, then the intercepted arc is 360 - m.\n\nElse, it's m.\n\nWait, how do we check if v2 is on the minor arc between v1 and v3?\n\nWell, the minor arc is the shortest path between v1 and v3.\n\nSo, the points on the minor arc are those that are in the order v1, v2, v3 (or similar) when moving along the minor arc.\n\nWait, but the points are arranged in a circle, so the minor arc can go either clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better way is to represent the positions as a sorted list.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the positions and see whether v2 is in the interval defined by the minor arc.\n\nWait, let's suppose that the minor arc is from v1 to v3 in the clockwise direction. So, the positions are pos_v1, pos_v3.\n\nThe minor arc is the one where the clockwise distance is less than 180 degrees.\n\nSo, the condition is whether v2's position is within the interval [pos_v1, pos_v3], assuming we traverse clockwise.\n\nWait, but in the circle, the intervals wrap around. So, perhaps it's easier to represent the positions in a linear fashion.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the start and end of the minor arc and see if v2 is in between.\n\nWait, another approach is to find the angular distance between v1 and v3.\n\nCompute d = (pos_v3 - pos_v1) % 360.\n\nIf d <= 180, then the minor arc is d, else it's 360 - d.\n\nWait, no: if d is the clockwise distance, and it's less than 180, then the minor arc is d. Otherwise, the minor arc is 360 - d.\n\nSo, minor_arc = min(d, 360 - d).\n\nOnce minor_arc is known, the intercepted arc is:\n\nif v2 is on the minor arc, then the intercepted arc is 360 - minor_arc.\n\nelse, it's minor_arc.\n\nWait, but how do we determine if v2 is on the minor arc?\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think in terms of the positions.\n\nSuppose the minor arc is from v1 to v3 in the clockwise direction. So, the positions are in the order v1, v2, v3 when moving clockwise.\n\nWait, no. Because the minor arc could be from v3 to v1 if the distance is smaller that way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minor arc is the one where the points are in order v1, v2, v3 when moving in the direction that covers the minor arc.\n\nWait, perhaps the condition is that v2 is between v1 and v3 in the minor arc's direction.\n\nSo, for a given minor arc direction, whether v2 is in that arc.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nThe minor arc is the shorter of the two possible arcs between v1 and v3.\n\nCase 1: minor arc is clockwise from v1 to v3.\n\nCheck if pos_v2 is >= pos_v1 and <= pos_v3.\n\nIf yes, then the intercepted arc is the major arc, which is 360 - minor_arc.\n\nCase 2: minor arc is counter-clockwise from v1 to v3.\n\nCheck if pos_v2 is <= pos_v1 and >= pos_v3 (but since the positions wrap around, this is tricky).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the positions modulo 360, sort them, and see if v2 is in the interval.\n\nWait, here's an idea:\n\nCompute pos_v1, pos_v3, and pos_v2.\n\nCompute the minor arc as the smaller of the two possible arcs between v1 and v3.\n\nThen, the intercepted arc is:\n\nif v2 is on the minor arc, then 360 - minor_arc.\n\nelse, minor_arc.\n\nSo, how to determine if v2 is on the minor arc.\n\nLet me consider that the minor arc is the one that goes from v1 to v3 in a certain direction.\n\nSo, if the minor arc is in the clockwise direction (d <= 180), then the points in the minor arc are from v1 to v3, passing through higher positions (since moving clockwise increases the position in a regular polygon).\n\nWait, no, because in a regular polygon, the positions are in increasing order as you go clockwise.\n\nWait, for a square, vertex 1 is at 0 degrees, vertex 2 at 90, vertex 3 at 180, etc.\n\nSo, moving clockwise, the position increases.\n\nSo, for a minor arc in the clockwise direction, the positions are in the order v1, v2, v3.\n\nSo, for the minor arc from v1 to v3 in the clockwise direction, if pos_v2 is between pos_v1 and pos_v3, then v2 is on the minor arc.\n\nElse, it's on the other arc.\n\nWait, but in the case where the minor arc is the counter-clockwise direction, which is the longer path.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated.\n\nAn alternative idea is to compute the angular distance between v1 and v3, determine the minor and major arcs, and then see whether v2 is on the minor arc.\n\nIf it is, then the intercepted arc is the major arc, else it's the minor arc.\n\nBut how to compute whether v2 is on the minor arc.\n\nWait, perhaps the minor arc is the one that's shorter, so the angular distance between v1 and v3 is d, and the minor arc is d if d <= 180, else 360-d.\n\nWait, no, because d is the clockwise distance.\n\nWait, the minor arc is the minimum of the two possible arcs between v1 and v3. So, minor_arc = min(d, 360 - d), where d is the clockwise distance from v1 to v3.\n\nSo, the intercepted arc is the other arc, which is 360 - minor_arc.\n\nWait, no. Because the intercepted arc is the one that does NOT contain v2.\n\nSo, if the minor arc between v1 and v3 contains v2, then the intercepted arc is the major arc (360 - minor_arc). Else, it's the minor arc.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute pos_v1, pos_v3, pos_v2.\n\n2. Compute the clockwise distance d = (pos_v3 - pos_v1) mod 360.\n\n3. minor_arc = min(d, 360 - d).\n\n4. If the minor arc contains v2, then intercepted_arc = 360 - minor_arc.\n\n   Else, intercepted_arc = minor_arc.\n\nBut how to determine if v2 is on the minor arc.\n\nWait, the minor arc is the shorter path between v1 and v3. So, if v2 is on that path, then the intercepted arc is the major arc.\n\nOtherwise, it's the minor arc.\n\nSo, to check whether v2 is on the minor arc:\n\n- If minor_arc is the clockwise path from v1 to v3, then check if pos_v2 is >= pos_v1 and <= pos_v3.\n\nBut wait, if the minor arc is the counter-clockwise path, then pos_v2 should be <= pos_v1 and >= pos_v3 + 360 (but since all positions are modulo 360, this is tricky).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to represent the positions as floating points and check whether v2 is in the interval [min(pos_v1, pos_v3), max(pos_v1, pos_v3)] modulo 360.\n\nBut that might not capture the direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minor arc can be represented as a segment on the circle. For example, if the minor arc is the clockwise path from v1 to v3, then the positions of v2 must be between pos_v1 and pos_v3.\n\nBut since the positions are on a circle, this can be represented as (pos_v1 < pos_v2 < pos_v3) when considering modulo 360.\n\nWait, perhaps yes.\n\nWait, for a given minor arc, which is the shorter path between v1 and v3, the points on that path satisfy either pos_v1 < pos_v2 < pos_v3 (when moving clockwise) or pos_v3 < pos_v2 < pos_v1 (when moving counter-clockwise).\n\nBut how to represent this.\n\nAlternatively, regardless of the direction, the minor arc is a continuous segment on the circle. So, the condition is whether v2 is in that segment.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nAnother idea: for the minor arc, which is the shorter path between v1 and v3, the points on that arc satisfy that the distance from v1 to v2 plus the distance from v2 to v3 is less than or equal to minor_arc.\n\nWait, no. Because the distance from v1 to v3 is the minor_arc, so the sum of v1-v2 and v2-v3 can't be less than minor_arc. It's exactly equal.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated.\n\nAn alternative plan: for each triplet (v1, v2, v3), compute the angle at v2 as follows:\n\nangle = (distance between v1 and v3 in the direction not containing v2) / 2\n\nwhere distance is in degrees.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle can be calculated as the absolute difference between the positions of v1 and v3, adjusted for the direction relative to v2.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the angle as the absolute difference between the vectors from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\nBut since the polygon is regular, the vectors can be represented in terms of their positions.\n\nSo, for v2, the position is p_v2.\n\nThe vectors from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3 are (p_v1 - p_v2) and (p_v3 - p_v2), respectively.\n\nBut since the points are on a circle, the angle between these vectors is the minimal angle between them.\n\nWait, but how to compute the angle between two vectors on a circle.\n\nWait, the angle between two vectors can be found by taking the absolute difference between their angles, but considering the minimal rotation.\n\nAlternatively, since the vectors are from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3, their directions are (p_v1 - p_v2) and (p_v3 - p_v2), but all positions are modulo 360.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle between the two vectors is the absolute difference between (p_v1 - p_v2) and (p_v3 - p_v2), modulo 360.\n\nWait, no. Because the vectors are (v1 - v2) and (v3 - v2), their directions are the differences in their positions.\n\nSo, the angle between them is the absolute difference in their direction angles.\n\nBut since the vectors are directed from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3, the angle is the minimal angle between them.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute the angle as the minimal absolute difference between (p_v1 - p_v2) and (p_v3 - p_v2), considering that the difference can be positive or negative.\n\nSo, angle_diff = abs( (p_v1 - p_v2) - (p_v3 - p_v2) ) \n\nWhich simplifies to abs(p_v1 - p_v3).\n\nBut that's not correct because it ignores the wrapping around 360 degrees.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle is the minimal of the absolute difference and 360 minus that difference.\n\nWait, no. Because p_v1 and p_v3 are positions on a circle. So the angle between the two vectors is the minimal angle required to rotate from one to the other, which can be either the clockwise or counter-clockwise angle.\n\nSo, the angle between the two vectors is the minimal of the absolute difference and 360 - absolute difference.\n\nBut wait, that's the minimal angle between the two vectors, which is what we need for the angle at v2.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the vectors are from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3, their angle is the angle between them, which is the minimal angle between their directions.\n\nBut in the context of the polygon, the angle at v2 is exactly that angle.\n\nSo, the angle is the minimal angle between the two vectors, which is the minimal of the absolute difference in their angles and 360 minus that.\n\nWait, but perhaps not, because the vectors are directed. For example, if one vector is at 10 degrees and the other at 350 degrees, the minimal angle between them is 20 degrees, not 340.\n\nSo, the angle between the two vectors is the minimal of the two possible angles.\n\nSo, the angle at v2 is the minimal angle between the vectors from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\nThus, the angle can be computed as:\n\ndelta = (p_v1 - p_v2) - (p_v3 - p_v2)\ndelta_abs = abs(delta)\nangle = delta_abs if delta_abs <= 180 else 360 - delta_abs\n\nWait, but delta_abs is (p_v1 - p_v3) mod 360.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the difference in the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2.\n\nWait, no, because the vectors are from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3, so their angles are (p_v1 - p_v2) and (p_v3 - p_v2) respectively.\n\nSo, the angle between them is the minimal of the absolute difference between these two angles, and 360 minus that.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nInstead of trying to compute the angle for each triplet, perhaps precompute all possible angles for each v2 and store the best candidates.\n\nBut for n=105, triplets are manageable.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\nLoop over each v2 from 1 to n.\n\nFor each v2, loop over all possible v1 and v3, where v1 != v2, v3 != v2, and v1 != v3.\n\nCompute the angle at v2 as described.\n\nTrack the triplet (v1, v2, v3) that has the minimal absolute difference between the angle and 'a'.\n\nIf multiple triplets have the same minimal difference, choose any.\n\nBut the problem is, how to compute the angle efficiently.\n\nSo, for each triplet, we need to compute the angle at v2.\n\nLet me think about how to compute this angle.\n\nEach vertex's position is at pos_v = 360*(v-1)/n degrees.\n\nSo, pos_v2 = 360*(v2-1)/n.\n\npos_v1 = 360*(v1-1)/n.\n\npos_v3 = 360*(v3-1)/n.\n\nThe vectors from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3 are at angles (pos_v1 - pos_v2) and (pos_v3 - pos_v2) degrees.\n\nThe angle between these two vectors is the minimal angle between them, which is the minimal of the absolute difference between the two angles and 360 - that difference.\n\nSo, the angle at v2 is:\n\ndelta = (pos_v1 - pos_v2) - (pos_v3 - pos_v2) = pos_v1 - pos_v3\n\nabs_delta = abs(delta)\n\nangle = abs_delta if abs_delta <= 180 else 360 - abs_delta\n\nSo, the angle is the minimal angle between the two vectors, which is the minimal angle between the two directions.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n\nangle = abs( (pos_v1 - pos_v3) )\n\nWait, no. Because pos_v1 and pos_v3 are positions relative to 0 degrees. So, the difference is pos_v1 - pos_v3, but since angles wrap around, this can be negative or positive beyond 360.\n\nSo, to compute the actual angle between the two vectors, we can compute the minimal angle between the two points on the circle.\n\nWait, but pos_v1 and pos_v3 are relative to the circle's origin, so the angle between the vectors from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3 is the minimal angle between the two vectors, which is the minimal of the clockwise and counter-clockwise angles.\n\nBut wait, according to the previous reasoning, the angle is the minimal of the absolute difference and 360 minus that.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle is the absolute value of (pos_v1 - pos_v3) modulo 360, and then take the minimal between that and 360 - that.\n\nWait, no. Because if (pos_v1 - pos_v3) is 350 degrees, then the minimal angle is 10 degrees, not 350.\n\nSo, the correct formula is:\n\ndelta = (pos_v1 - pos_v3) % 360\n\nangle = min(delta, 360 - delta)\n\nBut wait, that gives the minimal angle between the two vectors.\n\nWait, but that's the minimal angle between the two points, not considering the direction relative to v2.\n\nWait, no. Because the vectors are from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3, which have directions (pos_v1 - pos_v2) and (pos_v3 - pos_v2). So, the difference in their directions is (pos_v1 - pos_v2) - (pos_v3 - pos_v2) = pos_v1 - pos_v3.\n\nSo, the angle between the vectors is the minimal angle between the two directions, which is the minimal of the absolute difference between (pos_v1 - pos_v3) and 360 - that.\n\nSo, the angle is:\n\ndelta = (pos_v1 - pos_v3) % 360\n\nangle = min(delta, 360 - delta)\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the formula for the angle is:\n\nangle = min( (pos_v1 - pos_v3) % 360, 360 - ((pos_v1 - pos_v3) % 360) )\n\nWait, but (pos_v1 - pos_v3) can be negative, so taking mod 360 may give a negative result. So, perhaps:\n\ndelta = (pos_v1 - pos_v3) % 360\n\nif delta > 180:\n\n    angle = 360 - delta\n\nelse:\n\n    angle = delta\n\nSo, that's the correct way to compute the angle at v2.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFor each triplet (v1, v2, v3):\n\nCompute pos_v1 = 360*(v1-1)/n\n\npos_v3 = 360*(v3-1)/n\n\ndelta = (pos_v1 - pos_v3) % 360\n\nangle = min(delta, 360 - delta)\n\nThen, compute the absolute difference between angle and 'a' and keep track of the minimal.\n\nSo, now, the plan is to loop through all possible v2, then for each v2, loop through all possible v1 and v3, compute the angle, and track the triplet with the minimal difference.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the angle should be as close as possible to 'a' degrees. So, the goal is to minimize the absolute difference between the computed angle and 'a'.\n\nOnce all triplets are considered, select the one with the minimal difference. If multiple, any can be selected.\n\nNow, the question is: how to implement this efficiently.\n\nGiven that n can be up to 105, the total number of triplets is n*(n-1)*(n-2), which for n=105 is 105*104*103 = 1,092,120 triplets. Which is manageable.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\n- Read n and a.\n\n- Precompute the positions for each vertex as floating points.\n\n- For each v2 in 1..n:\n\n   - For each v1 in 1..n, v1 != v2:\n\n      - For each v3 in 1..n, v3 != v2 and v3 != v1:\n\n          - Compute pos_v1, pos_v3.\n\n          - Compute delta = (pos_v1 - pos_v3) % 360\n\n          - angle = min(delta, 360 - delta)\n\n          - Compute diff = abs(angle - a)\n\n          - Compare with current best, update if needed.\n\nBut wait, even for n=105, the triple loops would be 105 * 104 * 103 = about 1 million, which is manageable.\n\nBut wait, for each triplet, the order matters. Because the triplet (v1, v2, v3) is different from (v3, v2, v1), but in reality, the angle is the same because swapping v1 and v3 doesn't change the angle.\n\nWait, no. Because the angle is the same regardless of the order of v1 and v3.\n\nSo, to optimize, perhaps for each v2, we can consider all possible pairs (v1, v3) where v1 < v3, but considering the ordering.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that would save time. Since 1e6 is manageable, perhaps it's not necessary.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as:\n\nInitialize variables to track the best triplet: best_diff = infinity, best_triplet = None.\n\nLoop v2 from 1 to n:\n\n   Loop v1 from 1 to n:\n\n      if v1 == v2: continue\n\n      Loop v3 from 1 to n:\n\n          if v3 == v2 or v3 == v1: continue\n\n          # compute pos_v1 and pos_v3\n\n          pos_v1 = (v1-1)*360.0 / n\n\n          pos_v3 = (v3-1)*360.0 / n\n\n          delta = (pos_v1 - pos_v3) % 360\n\n          angle = min(delta, 360 - delta)\n\n          diff = abs(angle - a)\n\n          if diff < best_diff:\n\n              best_diff = diff\n\n              best_triplet = (v1, v2, v3)\n\n          elif diff == best_diff:\n\n              # optional: if we need to choose the first encountered, then no action. else, perhaps compare lex order.\n\n              # but the problem allows any, so no need.\n\nSo, after checking all triplets, output the best_triplet.\n\nBut wait, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 15\n\nSample Output: 1 2 3.\n\nIn a triangle, all possible triplets are (1,2,3), (2,1,3), (3,1,2), etc. Each triplet forms an angle of 60 degrees, which is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at a specific vertex is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. The solution involves iterating through all possible triplets of vertices and calculating the angle for each triplet to find the closest match.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires finding three vertices (v1, v2, v3) in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is closest to 'a'. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n2. **Geometric Insight**: Each vertex of a regular n-gon can be considered to lie on a unit circle. The position of each vertex can be represented as an angle in degrees.\n3. **Angle Calculation**: For each triplet (v1, v2, v3), the angle at v2 can be computed using the positions of these vertices on the circle.
