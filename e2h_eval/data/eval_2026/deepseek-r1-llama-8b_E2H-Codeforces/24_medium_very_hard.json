She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Luba is trying to close some tabs in her browser. Hmm, let me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo, the setup is that she has n tabs open, from 1 to n. The cursor starts at position pos. She needs to keep the tabs from l to r and close all others. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right, but only within the current available tabs. Or she can close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum number of seconds needed to achieve this.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. It seems like a state space problem where each state is defined by the current position of the cursor and the range of currently open tabs (a and b). But since a and b change as tabs are closed, this could get complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider what actions are necessary. To close the tabs outside [l, r], she needs to:\n\n1. Close all tabs to the left of l.\n2. Close all tabs to the right of r.\n\nBut wait, maybe not exactly. Because when you close tabs to the left of l, you have to make sure that the left closure doesn't affect the remaining tabs. So for example, if she closes all to the left of l, then the new a becomes l. Similarly, closing to the right of r sets the new b to r.\n\nSo the process involves moving the cursor to a position where she can perform these operations optimally.\n\nLet me break it down into steps:\n\nFirst, determine which tabs need to be closed. Those are everything before l (if l > 1) and everything after r (if r < n). So, the initial state has a=1 and b=n. The desired state is a = l and b = r.\n\nEach action is either moving the cursor or closing a side.\n\nWhen she moves, the cursor can go left or right, but within the current a and b. So, for example, if a is 3 and b is 6, and she's at 4, she can move to 3 or 5.\n\nWhen she closes, say, the left side, all tabs left of the current cursor (i-1) are closed, so a becomes i. Similarly for the right.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimal time to go from a=1, b=n to a=l, b=r via a series of moves and closures.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model this as a BFS problem where each state is (current_position, a, b). The transitions would be moving left, moving right, closing left, or closing right.\n\nWait, but the state space could be manageable because n is up to 100. So for each possible a and b, and each possible position between a and b, the state is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, since a and b can only change in certain ways, perhaps we can find a way to compute the minimal steps without exploring all possibilities.\n\nLet me think about the cases:\n\nCase 1: No need to close anything. If l=1 and r=n, then the answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: Only need to close left. So, she needs to close all tabs before l. She can do this by moving to l, then close left. The time is the distance from pos to l, plus 1 (for closing).\n\nCase 3: Only need to close right. Similar to case 2.\n\nCase 4: Need to close both left and right.\n\nIn case 4, she needs to:\n\n- Move to l, close left (cost: steps to l + 1).\n- Then, move to r, close right (steps from l to r + 1).\nTotal steps: (steps from pos to l) + 1 + (steps from l to r) + 1.\n\nBut wait, maybe she can optimize by closing one side first. Like, move to the furthest point needed, then close both sides.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's see.\n\nAlternative approach: the minimal steps would be determined by the order in which she closes the left and right.\n\nLet me see the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\nInput: 6 3 2 4\nShe needs to close tabs 1 and 5,6.\n\nThe solution is: move from 3 to 2 (1 step), close left (1 step). Then move to 3 (step?), then to 4 (another step), close right (1 step). Total 5 steps.\n\nWait, let's count:\n\nStep 1: move to 2 (from 3)\nStep 2: close left (tabs 1 are closed, a becomes 2)\nThen, current position is 2, a=2, b=6.\n\nShe needs to close 5 and 6.\n\nSo she moves from 2 to 3 (step 3), then to 4 (step 4), then close right (step5). So total 5 steps.\n\nAnother possible approach: Could she move to 4 first, then close right, then move back to 2, then close left? Let's see:\n\nFrom 3 to 4: 1 step. Close right: 5,6 are closed. Now a remains 1, but after closing right, the new b is 4.\n\nWait, no. When you close right of 4, you close 5,6. So now the available tabs are 1-4.\n\nThen she needs to close 1. So she can move from 4 to 2 (two steps?), but wait, after closing right, the current position is 4, and the new a is 1, but after closing left of 4, a would become 4.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think that after each close operation, a and b change.\n\nWait, for example, if she is at position i and closes the left, then the new a is i, because all tabs to the left are closed. Similarly, closing right sets b to i.\n\nSo, in the first sample, when she closes left at 2, a becomes 2.\n\nThen, she can move to 4 (positions 2 →3→4: 2 steps), then close right at 4, setting b to 4. So the steps are:\n\n1. move to 2: 1 step.\n\n2. close left: 1 step.\n\n3. move to 3: 1 step.\n\n4. move to 4: 1 step.\n\n5. close right: 1 step.\n\nTotal 5 steps.\n\nAlternatively, what if she first closes the right?\n\nAfter closing right at 3, the new b is 3. So the available tabs are 1-3, but she needs to keep 2-4. So that's not acceptable. So she can't do that.\n\nSo, the order matters. She needs to close left first, then right.\n\nSo the plan is to:\n\n1. Move to the position where she can close the left part. That would be l.\n\n2. Close the left part.\n\n3. Move to the position where she can close the right part. That would be r.\n\n4. Close the right part.\n\nBut wait, maybe she can close the right part first if it's more efficient.\n\nWait, for example, suppose l is on the left, and r is on the right. So she can choose to close the right first, then move to the left, close left.\n\nWhich is better depends on the distances.\n\nSo, the minimal steps would be the minimum between:\n\nOption A: close left first, then right.\n\nOption B: close right first, then left.\n\nWe need to calculate both options and choose the one with the least steps.\n\nSo, how to model this.\n\nFor option A:\n\nTime to move to l: |pos - l| steps.\n\nPlus 1 step to close left.\n\nThen, move from l to r: |r - l| steps.\n\nPlus 1 step to close right.\n\nTotal: |pos - l| + 1 + |r - l| + 1.\n\nBut wait, after closing left, the available tabs are from l to current b. So when she moves to r, she can go directly, because the movement is within l to current b, which is now n, but after closing left, the right hasn't been closed yet, so the right is still up to n until she closes the right.\n\nWait, no. Because after closing left, the a becomes l, but the b remains the same unless she closes the right.\n\nSo, in the first option, after closing left, she can move freely within the current a (l) and b (n), but when she's done, she'll close the right.\n\nSo, yes, moving from l to r is straightforward, as the path is direct.\n\nSimilarly, for option B:\n\nMove to r: |pos - r| steps.\n\nClose right: 1 step.\n\nThen move to l: |r - l| steps.\n\nClose left: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: |pos - r| + 1 + |r - l| + 1.\n\nWe need to calculate both options and take the minimum.\n\nBut wait, sometimes the initial position is already in a good spot.\n\nFor example, in the second sample input:\n\n6 3 1 3.\n\nShe needs to close all tabs except 1-3. Initially, pos is 3. So she can close the right side (tabs 4-6) in one step. So total steps: 1.\n\nThat's because she is already at 3, so moving is not needed.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal steps can be computed as follows:\n\nCompute the minimal steps required to close the left and right parts, considering whether she should close left first or right first.\n\nBut what about cases where she can close both in a single movement?\n\nWait, another scenario: she's at position x, and she can close left and right in such a way that the total movement is minimized.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps are the sum of the steps required to reach l and r, plus 2 (for closing each once), but also considering the initial position.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal steps can be calculated as follows:\n\nIf both l and r are to be closed, then:\n\nCompute the time to reach l, close left, then reach r, close right.\n\nPlus the time to reach r, close right, then reach l, close left.\n\nTake the minimum of these two.\n\nAdditionally, if l == r, then no steps are needed except possibly moving if needed.\n\nWait, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Check if l == 1 and r ==n. If so, output 0.\n\n2. Else, check if l == r. In this case, she needs to close all tabs outside l. So she can close left and/or right.\n\n   For example, if l=3 and r=3, then she needs to close all tabs before 3 and after 3.\n\n   So, she can move to 3, then close left, then close right.\n\n   The steps would be (distance from pos to 3) + 1 (close left) + 1 (close right).\n\n   But wait, perhaps she can close left and right in any order, but the movement is from pos to 3, then back and forth, but that might not be optimal.\n\nWait, no. Once she closes left, a becomes 3. Then she can close right by moving to 3 and closing right, which would set b to 3.\n\nSo the movement is pos to 3 (d steps), close left (1), then close right (1). So total d+2.\n\nAlternatively, if she closes right first, then she can close right from 3, then move to 3 again to close left. Same steps.\n\nSo, in this case, the minimal steps are d + 2.\n\nBut maybe she can do it faster by moving to 3, close left, then close right, which is the same as above.\n\nSo, for l == r, the steps are the steps to reach l, plus 2.\n\n3. Else, when both l and r are to be kept, and they are not covering the entire range.\n\nThen, the problem is to decide whether to close left first or right first, whichever gives the minimal steps.\n\nSo, for each option, compute the steps:\n\nOption 1: close left first.\n\n- Steps: move from current pos to l, which is |pos - l| steps.\n\n- Close left: +1 step.\n\n- Then, move from l to r: |r - l| steps.\n\n- Close right: +1 step.\n\nTotal: |pos-l| + 1 + |r-l| + 1 = |pos-l| + |r-l| + 2.\n\nOption 2: close right first.\n\n- Steps: move from pos to r: |pos - r| steps.\n\n- Close right: +1 step.\n\n- Then, move from r to l: |r - l| steps.\n\n- Close left: +1 step.\n\nTotal: |pos-r| + 1 + |r-l| + 1 = |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because after closing right, the a remains the same, but the b becomes r. So when moving from r to l, the movement is within a = current a (which is 1 initially) and b = r.\n\nWait, no, after closing right, the b becomes r, so the available tabs are from a (which is 1) to r.\n\nSo, when moving from r to l, the path is from r to l, but within 1 to r. So the movement is |r - l| steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the total steps for each option is (option1) (pos to l) + 1 + (l to r) +1 = (pos to l) + (l to r) + 2.\n\nSimilarly for option2: (pos to r) + (r to l) + 2.\n\nWait, but wait, (l to r) and (r to l) are the same, so the difference between option1 and option2 is the initial movement from pos to l or to r.\n\nSo, the minimal steps will be the minimum between (|pos - l| + |r - l| + 2) and (|pos - r| + |r - l| + 2).\n\nWait, because |r - l| is fixed, it's the same in both options.\n\nSo, the minimal steps would be min( |pos - l| + 2, |pos - r| + 2 ) + (r-l)*something?\n\nWait, no, because |r-l| is added in both cases.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-calculate:\n\nOption1: |pos - l| (move to l) + 1 (close left) + |r - l| (move to r) + 1 (close right) = |pos-l| + |r-l| + 2.\n\nOption2: |pos - r| (move to r) + 1 (close right) + |r - l| (move to l) + 1 (close left) = |pos - r| + |r-l| + 2.\n\nSo the minimal steps are min(option1, option2) = (min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|)) * 2 + (r-l)*1 + 2? Wait, no, because |r-l| is added in both options.\n\nWait, the total steps for both options is |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2 and |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nSo, the minimal between those two is min( |pos-l| + |r-l| + 2, |pos -r| + |r-l| + 2 ).\n\nSince |r-l| is common, it's equivalent to min( |pos - l| + 2, |pos - r| + 2 ) + (r-l).\n\nWait, no. Because |pos - l| + |r-l| = |pos - l| + (r - l), assuming r >= l.\n\nSimilarly, |pos - r| + |r-l| = |pos - r| + (r - l).\n\nSo the minimal steps would be min( (|pos-l| + (r-l)) + 2, (|pos - r| + (r-l)) + 2 ), which simplifies to (r-l) + 2 + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ).\n\nWait, but that's not accurate because |pos - l| + |r - l| is not necessarily equal to |pos - l| + (r - l). For example, if l=2, r=4, and pos is 3, then |pos-l|=1, |r-l|=2, sum is 3. Which is same as |pos-l| + (r-l) = 1+2=3.\n\nBut what if pos is 5, l=2, r=4. Then |pos-l| is 3, |r-l| is 2. Sum is 5, while |pos - l| + (r-l) is 3+2=5.\n\nSo, in general, |pos - l| + |r - l| = |pos - l| + (r - l) since r >= l.\n\nWait, because |r - l| is r-l as r >= l.\n\nSo, yes, |pos - l| + |r-l| is |pos-l| + (r-l).\n\nSame for |pos - r| + |r-l| = |pos - r| + (r-l).\n\nSo, the minimal steps would be (r - l) + 2 + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ).\n\nWait, but that's not correct because in some cases, the initial position might be in a way that allows for a better movement.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal steps can be found by considering both options and choosing the one that gives the minimal sum.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nIf she needs to close both left and right, the minimal steps are the minimum between:\n\n- Moving to l, close left, then move to r, close right.\n\nOR\n\n- Moving to r, close right, then move to l, close left.\n\nAnd each of these requires:\n\nFor option 1: (|pos - l| + 1) + (|r - l| + 1) = |pos-l| + |r-l| + 2.\n\nFor option 2: (|pos - r| + 1) + (|r-l| +1) = |pos-r| + |r-l| + 2.\n\nSo the minimal steps would be the minimum of option1 and option2.\n\nNow, considering all the cases.\n\nLet me think about some examples.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nOption1: move to 2 (1 step), close left (1), then move to 4 (2 steps), close right (1). Total: 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nOption2: move to 4 (1 step), close right (1), then move to 2 (2 steps), close left (1). Total: 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nSo both options give 5 steps.\n\nThus, the answer is 5.\n\nTest case 2:\n\nn=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3.\n\nShe needs to close 4-6. So she can close right from 3, which takes 1 step.\n\nBecause moving from 3 to 3 is 0 steps, then close right (tabs 4-6 are closed). So total steps: 0 +1 =1.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5.\n\nShe needs to close nothing, so steps are 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nShe needs to close 1 and 5.\n\nOption1: move to 2 (1 step), close left (1), then move to4 (2 steps), close right (1). Total 5 steps.\n\nOption2: move to4 (1 step), close right (1), move to2 (2 steps), close left (1). Also 5 steps.\n\nAnother example: n=7, pos=4, l=3, r=5.\n\nShe needs to close 1-2 and 6-7.\n\nOption1: move to3 (1 step), close left (1), move to5 (2 steps), close right (1). Total 5 steps.\n\nOption2: move to5 (1 step), close right (1), move to3 (2 steps), close left (1). Total 5 steps.\n\nWhat if pos is in between l and r?\n\nLike n=10, pos=5, l=3, r=7.\n\nOption1: move to3 (2 steps), close left (1), move to7 (4 steps), close right (1). Total 8 steps.\n\nOption2: move to7 (2 steps), close right (1), move to3 (4 steps), close left (1). Total 8 steps.\n\nWhat if she can reach l or r with zero steps? Like if pos is already at l or r.\n\nFor example, pos= l=3, r=5, n=10.\n\nOption1: 0 steps to l, close left (1), then move to5 (2 steps), close right (1). Total 4 steps.\n\nOption2: 0 steps to r, close right (1), move to3 (2 steps), close left (1). Total 4 steps.\n\nSo, same as before.\n\nAnother case: l=1, r=n. Then, no steps needed.\n\nAnother case: l=1, r=3, n=5, pos=5.\n\nShe needs to close 4 and 5.\n\nOption1: move to1 (4 steps), close left (1), but that's not helpful because closing left when already at 1 does nothing. So perhaps, she needs to instead move to3, close right.\n\nWait, no, because l=1, r=3.\n\nWait, she needs to close everything except 1-3. So, she can close right from 3, which takes 1 step. So steps: 2 steps (move from5 to3) +1 =3.\n\nBut according to our earlier approach, option2 is better.\n\nBecause option1 would require moving to l=1, which is far.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal steps are 2 (move from5 to3) +1 (close right) =3 steps.\n\nBut according to our formula, for option2:\n\n|pos -r| is 2 (5 to3), |r-l|=2.\n\nSo option2's steps: 2 + 2 + 2 =6? That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-calculate.\n\nWait, the formula was for when both l and r need to be closed.\n\nWait, in this case, l=1, r=3, and she needs to close 4 and 5.\n\nSo according to our approach, she needs to close both left and right.\n\nWait, no, because l=1 is already the first tab. So she only needs to close the right.\n\nSo, this case is when she only needs to close the right, not both.\n\nSo, in this case, the approach is different.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial analysis was incomplete because I didn't account for the fact that sometimes only one side needs to be closed.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nThe problem says that she needs to leave the segment [l, r] open. So, any tabs before l must be closed, and any tabs after r must be closed.\n\nSo, the number of tabs to close is (l-1) + (n - r).\n\nSo, if l>1, she needs to close the left part.\n\nIf r <n, she needs to close the right part.\n\nSo, the steps depend on whether both are needed.\n\nSo, the problem can be broken down into:\n\nIf l>1 and r <n:\n\n   Need to close both left and right.\n\nElse if l>1 and r==n:\n\n   Only need to close left.\n\nElse if r <n and l==1:\n\n   Only need to close right.\n\nElse if l==1 and r==n:\n\n   Do nothing.\n\nSo, the initial approach is to handle each of these cases.\n\nSo, let's structure the solution:\n\nCalculate the number of tabs to close on the left and right.\n\nleft_close = (l > 1)\n\nright_close = (r < n)\n\nif neither left nor right needs to be closed:\n\n   output 0\n\nelse if both:\n\n   compute the minimal steps to close both, which is the minimum between option1 and option2.\n\nelif only left:\n\n   steps: move to l, close left.\n\n   but wait, after closing left, the a becomes l.\n\n   but she may need to move to l, but she can be at any position.\n\n   So, steps are (distance from pos to l) + 1.\n\nelif only right:\n\n   steps: (distance from pos to r) +1.\n\nWait, but in the case where l>1 and r <n, the steps for only closing left would be moving to l, then closing. But then, after that, she also needs to close the right.\n\nWait, no. Because in that case, she has to close both.\n\nWait, no. For example, if l=2, r=4, n=6, pos=3.\n\nShe needs to close 1,5,6.\n\nShe can choose to first close left, then right.\n\nBut that's what the case where both are closed is.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect. Let me think differently.\n\nThe problem is to compute the minimal steps to close all tabs outside [l, r].\n\nThis requires closing all tabs less than l and all tabs greater than r.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Close all tabs to the left of l.\n\n2. Close all tabs to the right of r.\n\nBut the order of these steps can vary.\n\nSo, the minimal steps would be the sum of the steps to close each side, considering the most optimal way to reach the positions to perform the closures.\n\nSo, for closing the left side:\n\nShe needs to be at a position >= l.\n\nWait, no. Because when she is at position i, she can close all tabs to the left, which are i-1 and below.\n\nSo, to close the left, she needs to be at i >= l.\n\nSimilarly, to close the right, she needs to be at i <= r.\n\nSo, she can choose to close left first, then right, or vice versa.\n\nThus, the minimal steps would be:\n\nsum = steps_to_close_left + steps_to_close_right.\n\nWhere steps_to_close_left is the minimal steps to reach a position >= l, then close left.\n\nsteps_to_close_right is the minimal steps to reach a position <= r, then close right.\n\nBut the movement after closing left affects the possible positions.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternative approach: model the problem as BFS, where each state is (current_pos, a, b), and each transition is a move or a close.\n\nBut given that n is small (up to 100), this is feasible.\n\nEach state can be represented as (current_pos, a, b).\n\nThe initial state is (pos, 1, n).\n\nThe target states are those where a == l and b == r.\n\nEach transition is either:\n\n1. Move left: current_pos -1, but not less than a.\n\n2. Move right: current_pos +1, but not more than b.\n\n3. Close left: a becomes current_pos, and current_pos decreases by 1 (since after closing, the new a is current_pos).\n\nWait, no. Closing left sets a to current_pos, so all tabs to the left of current_pos are closed.\n\nSimilarly, closing right sets b to current_pos.\n\nSo, when you close left, the new a is current_pos.\n\nSo, the next state after closing left would be (current_pos, a_new, b), where a_new is current_pos.\n\nBut since the movement is allowed only within a and b, after closing left, the a increases, so the movement options change.\n\nSo, the BFS approach would explore all possible states and find the minimal steps.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Use BFS to explore all possible states.\n\n- Each state is (current_pos, a, b).\n\n- The initial state is (pos, 1, n).\n\n- The target is any state where a == l and b == r.\n\n- For each state, generate all possible next states:\n\n   a. Move left: new_pos = current_pos -1. But new_pos >= a.\n\n   b. Move right: new_pos = current_pos +1. But new_pos <= b.\n\n   c. Close left: new_a = current_pos. new_b remains the same. So, new state is (current_pos, new_a, b).\n\n   d. Close right: new_b = current_pos. new_a remains the same. So, new state is (current_pos, a, new_b).\n\nEach transition takes 1 step.\n\nWe can use a priority queue or a visited array to track the minimal steps to reach each state.\n\nWait, but since we're looking for the minimal steps, BFS is appropriate.\n\nSo, the algorithm would proceed as follows:\n\nInitialize a queue with the initial state (pos, 1, n), steps=0.\n\nMark this state as visited.\n\nWhile the queue is not empty:\n\n   Dequeue the current state (p, a, b), steps.\n\n   If a == l and b == r: return steps.\n\n   For each possible action (move left, move right, close left, close right):\n\n      Compute the new_pos, new_a, new_b based on the action.\n\n      Check if new_pos is within [new_a, new_b]. Because after closing, new_a and new_b change.\n\n      Wait, after closing left, the new a is p, so new_a = p. So, new_pos can be p (since after closing, the cursor is at p, and the new a is p).\n\n      Similarly for closing right.\n\n      So, for each action:\n\n      1. Move left:\n\n         new_p = p -1.\n\n         if new_p >= a: valid.\n\n         new_a = a.\n\n         new_b = b.\n\n      2. Move right:\n\n         new_p = p +1.\n\n         if new_p <= b: valid.\n\n         new_a = a.\n\n         new_b = b.\n\n      3. Close left:\n\n         new_a = p.\n\n         new_p = p.\n\n         new_b = b.\n\n         So, new_p must be >= new_a? No, because after closing, new_a is p, so new_p is p >= new_a (since new_a is p).\n\n         So, it's always valid.\n\n      4. Close right:\n\n         new_b = p.\n\n         new_p = p.\n\n         new_a = a.\n\n         So, new_p must be <= new_b.\n\n         Since new_b is p, which is the current position, this is valid.\n\n      For each transition, compute new_p, new_a, new_b.\n\n      If this new state hasn't been visited, enqueue it with steps+1.\n\nOnce the target state is found, return the steps.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nTesting this approach against the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nInitial state: (3,1,6), steps=0.\n\nCheck if a==l and b==r: 1 !=2, so proceed.\n\nPossible actions:\n\nMove left: new_p=2, a=1, b=6.\n\nMove right: new_p=4, a=1, b=6.\n\nClose left: new_p=3, a=3, b=6.\n\nClose right: new_p=3, a=1, b=3.\n\nEnqueue all these.\n\nLet's see:\n\nAfter step 1, the queue has:\n\n(2,1,6): steps=1.\n\n(4,1,6): steps=1.\n\n(3,3,6): steps=1.\n\n(3,1,3): steps=1.\n\nNow, process (2,1,6):\n\nCheck if a=1 == l=2? No.\n\nPossible actions:\n\nMove left: new_p=1, a=1, b=6.\n\nMove right: new_p=3, a=1, b=6.\n\nClose left: new_p=2, a=2, b=6.\n\nClose right: new_p=2, a=1, b=2.\n\nEnqueue these.\n\nBut perhaps the BFS will find the minimal steps.\n\nIn the end, the solution will find the minimal steps.\n\nSo, implementing this BFS approach should work.\n\nBut considering that n is up to 100, the possible states are manageable.\n\nEach state is (current_pos, a, b). Since a and b can each be up to 100, and current_pos is up to 100, the total possible states are 100*100*100 = 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is to implement BFS.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nWe'll represent each state as a tuple (pos, a, b).\n\nWe'll use a 3D visited array or a dictionary to track visited states.\n\nWe can use a priority queue, but since BFS finds the minimal steps level by level, a standard queue is sufficient.\n\nSo, steps:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nCompute initial a=1, b=n.\n\nIf l ==1 and r ==n:\n\n   output 0.\n\nElse:\n\n   Initialize a queue with (pos, a, b) and steps=0.\n\n   Create a visited set to track visited (a, b, pos).\n\n   While queue not empty:\n\n      Dequeue (p, a, b), steps.\n\n      If a == l and b == r: return steps.\n\n      For each possible action:\n\n         compute new_p, new_a, new_b.\n\n         if new_p is within [new_a, new_b], and (new_a, new_b, new_p) not visited:\n\n             enqueue it with steps+1.\n\n             mark as visited.\n\nContinue until found.\n\nNow, let's implement this.\n\nWait, but when we close left, new_a becomes p, but new_p is p.\n\nSo, after closing left, the new a is p, and new_p is p.\n\nSimilarly for closing right.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nFor each action:\n\n   if action is 'move left':\n\n       new_p = p -1\n\n       if new_p >= a:\n\n           new_state = (new_p, a, b)\n\n   elif action is 'move right':\n\n       new_p = p +1\n\n       if new_p <= b:\n\n           new_state = (new_p, a, b)\n\n   elif action is 'close left':\n\n       new_a = p\n\n       new_p = p\n\n       new_state = (new_p, new_a, b)\n\n   elif action is 'close right':\n\n       new_b = p\n\n       new_p = p\n\n       new_state = (new_p, a, new_b)\n\nWait, but after closing, the new a or b changes.\n\nSo, for 'close left', the new a is p, and the new p is p.\n\nFor 'close right', the new b is p, and the new p is p.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor each possible action:\n\n   if action is move left:\n\n       new_p = p -1\n\n       if new_p >= a:\n\n           new_state = (new_p, a, b)\n\n   elif action is move right:\n\n       new_p = p +1\n\n       if new_p <= b:\n\n           new_state = (new_p, a, b)\n\n   elif action is close left:\n\n       new_p = p\n\n       new_a = p\n\n       new_state = (new_p, new_a, b)\n\n   elif action is close right:\n\n       new_p = p\n\n       new_b = p\n\n       new_state = (new_p, a, new_b)\n\nSo, in code, for each action, compute new_p, new_a, new_b.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nif l ==1 and r ==n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    a = 1\n\n    b = n\n\n    from collections import deque\n\n    visited = set()\n\n    queue = deque()\n\n    queue.append( (pos, a, b) )\n\n    visited.add( (a, b, pos) )\n\n    found = False\n\n    while queue:\n\n        p, a, b = queue.popleft()\n\n        if a == l and b == r:\n\n            print(steps)\n\n            found = True\n\n            break\n\n        # Generate all possible next states.\n\n        # Move left\n\n        new_p = p -1\n\n        if new_p >= a:\n\n            new_state = (new_p, a, b)\n\n            if (a, b, new_p) not in visited:\n\n                visited.add( (a, b, new_p) )\n\n                queue.append( (new_p, a, b) )\n\n        # Move right\n\n        new_p = p +1\n\n        if new_p <= b:\n\n            new_state = (new_p, a, b)\n\n            if (a, b, new_p) not in visited:\n\n                visited.add( (a, b, new_p) )\n\n                queue.append( (new_p, a, b) )\n\n        # Close left\n\n        new_p = p\n\n        new_a = p\n\n        new_b = b\n\n        new_state = (new_p, new_a, new_b)\n\n        if (new_a, new_b, new_p) not in visited:\n\n            visited.add( (new_a, new_b, new_p) )\n\n            queue.append( (new_p, new_a, new_b) )\n\n        # Close right\n\n        new_p = p\n\n        new_a = a\n\n        new_b = p\n\n        new_state = (new_p, new_a, new_b)\n\n        if (new_a, new_b, new_p) not in visited:\n\n            visited.add( (new_a, new_b, new_p) )\n\n            queue.append( (new_p, new_a, new_b) )\n\n    if not found:\n\n        # This shouldn't happen as per problem constraints.\n\n        pass\n\nBut wait, the code isn't handling the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment [l, r] in her browser. The approach involves using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible states efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Luba can move the cursor left or right within the current range of open tabs or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor. The goal is to find the minimal steps required to leave only the tabs from l to r open.\n\n2. **State Representation**: Each state is represented by the current position of the cursor and the range of currently open tabs (a and b). The initial state starts with the cursor at position `pos`, and the range from 1 to n.\n\n3. **BFS Algorithm**: We use BFS to explore all possible states because it guarantees finding the shortest path (minimum steps) in an unweighted graph. Each state transition corresponds to moving the cursor or closing tabs on either side.\n\n4. **State Transitions**: From each state, we consider four possible actions: moving left, moving right, closing all tabs to the left, and closing all tabs to the right. Each action changes the state and the range of open tabs accordingly.\n\n5. **Termination Condition**: The BFS terminates when we reach a state where the range of open tabs is exactly [l, r].\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    visited = set()\n    queue = deque()\n    initial_a, initial_b = 1, n\n    queue.append((pos, initial_a, initial_b))\n    visited.add((initial_a, initial_b, pos))\n    found = False\n    steps = 0\n\n    while queue:\n        p, a, b = queue.popleft()\n        if a == l and b == r:\n            print(steps)\n            found = True\n            break\n        # Generate all possible next states\n        # Move left\n        new_p = p - 1\n        if new_p >= a:\n            new_state = (new_p, a, b)\n            key = (a, b, new_p)\n            if key not in visited:\n                visited.add(key)\n                queue.append(new_state)\n        # Move right\n        new_p = p + 1\n        if new_p <= b:\n            new_state = (new_p, a, b)\n            key = (a, b, new_p)\n            if key not in visited:\n                visited.add(key)\n                queue.append(new_state)\n        # Close left\n        new_p = p\n        new_a = p\n        new_b = b\n        new_state = (new_p, new_a, new_b)\n        key = (new_a, new_b, new_p)\n        if key not in visited:\n            visited.add(key)\n            queue.append(new_state)\n        # Close right\n        new_p = p\n        new_a = a\n        new_b = p\n        new_state = (new_p, new_a, new_b)\n        key = (new_a, new_b, new_p)\n        if key not in visited:\n            visited.add(key)\n            queue.append(new_state)\n    if not found:\n        print(-1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initial Check**: If the target range [l, r] covers all tabs (from 1 to n), no steps are needed.\n- **BFS Initialization**: Start BFS from the initial state with the cursor at `pos` and the range from 1 to n.\n- **State Exploration**: For each state, explore all possible actions (moving left, moving right, closing left, closing right) and generate new states.\n- **Visited States**: Track visited states to avoid reprocessing and ensure efficiency.\n- **Termination**: The BFS terminates when the target state (tabs exactly in [l, r]) is reached, and the number of steps is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible ways to close the unnecessary tabs using BFS, ensuring the minimum steps are found.",
