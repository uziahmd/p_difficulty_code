    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the maximum value of a function f(x) for x in the range 0 ≤ x ≤ m. The function f(x) is calculated by summing certain elements of an array a based on the binary representation of x. \n\nLet me break down what the function f(x) does. For each bit i in the binary representation of x, if the bit is 1, we add a_i to the sum. So f(x) is the sum of a_i's where the ith bit in x is set.\n\nMy task is to find the maximum value of f(x) for all x from 0 to m, inclusive.\n\nThe input includes:\n- n: the number of elements in array a.\n- The array a itself.\n- A binary string representing m.\n\nSo first, I need to process the binary string into an integer m. Then, compute f(x) for every x from 0 to m and find the maximum.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 105, which means that a has 105 elements. The maximum x can be up to m, which could be as big as 2^105 - 1, because the binary string has n digits. Wait, no, wait. The binary string is given for m, but the length of the binary string is n digits? Or is it that the binary string is a sequence of s_0 to s_{n-1}, which represents m. Hmm, the problem statement says: \"the third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn-1 — the binary representation of number m.\" So m is a number whose binary form has exactly n bits. So m can be as large as 2^n -1. But n can be up to 105, which is a very large number. So m can be up to 2^105, which is way too big to handle with a brute force approach.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because if n is 105, then m can be up to 2^105, which is around 10^31. We can't iterate through all x from 0 to m because that would take way too long. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nHmm, so the key is to find a way to compute the maximum f(x) without checking every possible x in the range.\n\nLet me think about how f(x) behaves. f(x) is the sum of a_i for each bit i that is set in x. So f(x) is like a bitmask sum. To maximize f(x), we want x to have as many high-value a_i's as possible.\n\nThis sounds similar to the problem of finding the maximum subset sum, but constrained by the bits that x can have. So perhaps the optimal x is the one that selects the maximum possible a_i's, subject to x being less than or equal to m.\n\nWait, but x must not exceed m. So the maximum f(x) will be either the sum when all a_i's are selected (but only if that x is <=m) or some combination that doesn't exceed m.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as trying to find a subset of the bits that can be turned on in x such that the resulting x is <=m, and the sum of the corresponding a_i's is maximized.\n\nSo the problem reduces to selecting a subset of bits (each bit corresponds to a position i) such that the sum of 2^i for those bits is <= m, and the sum of a_i's is as large as possible.\n\nBut even this isn't directly helpful because the a_i's may not be in any particular order, and we can't just choose all bits because their sum might be larger than m.\n\nWait, but perhaps the a_i's can be considered in a certain way. Since each bit contributes its a_i to the sum, maybe we should try to include as many high a_i's as possible, starting from the highest bit.\n\nBut since the bits correspond to their positions, the higher bits have higher weights in x's value. So including a high a_i (like a_3 for 8) could contribute a lot to both x and the sum f(x).\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to try to construct x bit by bit, starting from the highest bit, deciding whether to include each a_i if doing so keeps x within m.\n\nWait, but how? Because including a higher a_i may restrict lower bits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum f(x) is achieved by the largest possible x less than or equal to m, but that's not necessarily true because some a_i's might be small, and adding more of them could give a higher sum even if x is smaller.\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose a_0 is 100, and a_1 is 1. Then x=1 gives f(x)=100, which is better than x=3 (binary 11) which gives f(x)=101.\n\nSo sometimes, choosing a lower x (with more low bits set) can yield a higher sum.\n\nSo the optimal x may not be the maximum possible x under m. Therefore, we need to find a way to explore the possible subsets of bits that are allowed under m and find the one that gives the maximum sum.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 105, the total possible subsets is 2^105, which is impossible to check exhaustively.\n\nSo we need a dynamic programming approach.\n\nHmm, let's model the problem as a knapsack-like problem. Each bit can be considered as an item, and choosing it adds a_i to the sum and contributes 2^i to the x's value. However, the constraint is that the sum of 2^i's must be ≤ m.\n\nBut the problem is that the bits are not independent; each bit is a specific power of two. So perhaps, processing the bits from the highest to the lowest, and for each bit, decide whether to include it or not, ensuring that including it doesn't make x exceed m.\n\nThis sounds like a dynamic programming approach where the state is the current x value, and the maximum sum achievable up to that point.\n\nBut with m up to 2^105, the state space is way too big for standard DP.\n\nWait, but maybe the sum can be represented in a way that allows us to track the maximum sum for each possible x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent the possible x values and their maximum sums in a way that builds upon each bit.\n\nLet me think: for each bit position i (from 0 to n-1, perhaps?), we can consider whether to set it or not.\n\nWait, but the bits are from 0 to n-1, right? Because the binary string is s_0 to s_{n-1}. So each s_j is the j-th bit of m. So for example, if the binary string is '11010', then m is 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 16 + 8 + 2 = 26.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the binary string is s0 s1 ... sn-1, which represents m. So for example, s0 is the least significant bit (2^0), s1 is 2^1, etc., up to sn-1, which is 2^{n-1}.\n\nSo the bits are ordered from least significant to most significant. So for the binary string, the leftmost digit is the highest bit.\n\nSo when building x, each bit i corresponds to 2^i, and whether the bit is set depends on the corresponding s_i in the binary string.\n\nWait, no. Because in the binary string, the first character is s_0, which is the 2^0 place. So the order is from least significant to most significant. So for example, the binary string '11010' represents:\n\ns0 = 0 → 2^0 *0\ns1 = 1 → 2^1 *1\ns2 = 0 → 2^2 *0\ns3 = 1 → 2^3 *1\ns4 = 1 → 2^4 *1\nWhich sums to 0 + 2 + 0 + 8 + 16 = 26.\n\nSo the bits are numbered 0 to n-1, with 0 being the least significant.\n\nSo when building x, each bit i (starting from 0) contributes 2^i to x.\n\nNow, the problem is to select a subset of these bits such that the sum of 2^i for the selected bits is ≤ m, and the sum of a_i's is maximized.\n\nHmm. So the key is that for each bit i, if it's selected, it contributes 2^i to x and a_i to the sum. So we need to select a subset of bits where the sum of 2^i's is ≤ m, and the sum of a_i's is as large as possible.\n\nSo the problem is similar to a knapsack problem where each item is a choice to include a certain 2^i, which has a weight (2^i) and a value (a_i). We can choose any subset of items, but the total weight must not exceed m, and we aim to maximize the total value.\n\nHowever, in the standard knapsack problem, the weights are additive, and each item can be taken at most once. This fits here because each bit can be either 0 or 1.\n\nSo the problem can be modeled as a 0-1 knapsack problem where the capacity is m, and each item corresponds to a bit i, with weight 2^i and value a_i.\n\nBut the issue is that m can be up to 2^105, which is a huge number. The standard dynamic programming approach for knapsack has a time complexity of O(n * C), where C is the capacity. Here, C is up to 2^105, which is way beyond anything manageable.\n\nTherefore, the standard DP approach is not feasible.\n\nWe need another approach.\n\nLet me think differently. Since each bit is a power of two, perhaps we can process the bits in order from the highest to the lowest, making decisions at each step.\n\nAt each step, for bit i (starting from the highest), we can decide whether to set it or not. If setting it is possible (i.e., the sum of 2^i plus the sum of previously set bits is ≤ m), then we do so if it increases the sum. Otherwise, we leave it unset.\n\nWait, but that's a greedy approach. Would it work?\n\nFor example, suppose a_i is very large for a higher bit, but including it would cause x to exceed m. So perhaps we need to include it if possible, but if not, look for other options.\n\nAlternatively, the optimal solution is to include as many high a_i's as possible, but subject to x being ≤ m.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother idea is to model the problem as a binary decision tree, where each node represents a certain sum of 2^i's, and the path represents the bits chosen. The goal is to find the path that maximizes the sum of a_i's without exceeding m.\n\nBut again, with 105 bits, this seems unmanageable.\n\nWait, but perhaps the sum of a_i's can be represented in a way that allows us to find the maximum without considering all possible combinations.\n\nWait, let's think about the bits in reverse order. Let me process them from the highest bit (n-1) down to 0.\n\nFor each bit i, I can decide whether to include it in x. If I include it, I add a_i to the sum and 2^i to x. But I have to ensure that x doesn't exceed m.\n\nBut since x is built from the higher bits to lower, including a higher bit may limit the choices for lower bits.\n\nSo the approach could be to try to include each bit if possible, but perhaps there's a case where including a lower bit gives a better sum despite having a higher x.\n\nBut I'm not sure. It might be tricky.\n\nAn alternative approach is to note that each bit can be either included or not, and the selection of bits must form a number x ≤ m. So for each bit, if the bit is set in m, then in our x, we can choose to set it or not. But if the bit is not set in m, we cannot set it in x.\n\nWait, no. Because x can be any number up to m, not necessarily a subset of m's bits. For example, m could be 5 (101 in binary). x can be 6 (110), but that's larger than m. So no, that's not allowed.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because x must be ≤ m. So for each bit i, the choice is whether to set it in x, but the overall x must be ≤ m.\n\nSo for each bit i, if the current prefix of x is already less than m's prefix, then we can set or not set the bit. If the prefix is equal, then we can't set the bit if m's bit is 0.\n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding the maximum number less than or equal to m, constructed by selecting certain bits, with each bit contributing a_i to the sum.\n\nWait, yes! So the problem can be approached by greedily choosing the bits that maximize the sum, but ensuring that the resulting x is ≤ m.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the binary representation of m. Let's say m has bits b_0, b_1, ..., b_{n-1}, where b_0 is the least significant bit.\n\nWe need to build x's bits x_0, x_1, ..., x_{n-1}, such that x ≤ m, and the sum of a_x's is maximized.\n\nSo for each bit from the highest (leftmost) to the lowest (rightmost), decide whether to set x_i to 1.\n\nAt each step, when considering bit i, we can track whether the current x is already less than the prefix of m up to i bits. If it is, then for the remaining bits, we can choose to set any bits, as they won't affect the x being ≤ m. If it's equal, then we can't set bits beyond this point unless m's bit is 1.\n\nWait, perhaps this can be modeled using a recursive approach, keeping track of whether the current x is already less than m's prefix up to bit i.\n\nBut with 105 bits, recursion might be too slow, but perhaps memoization can help.\n\nAlternatively, we can model this with a state that tracks whether the current x is tight (exactly matching m's prefix up to this bit) or not.\n\nSo the state can be represented as (current bit, is_tight). At each step, for the current bit, we can decide to set it to 0 or 1, but if is_tight is true, then we can't set it to 1 if m's bit is 0.\n\nWait, but for the sum of a_i's, setting a bit to 1 gives a_i, but also affects the x's value.\n\nSo the DP state needs to track the sum of a_i's so far, along with whether the current x is tight.\n\nBut the sum can be up to 105 * 104 = 10920, which is manageable.\n\nWait, that's a good point. Each a_i can be up to 104, and there are up to 105 bits. So the maximum sum is 105 * 104 = 10920. That's manageable.\n\nSo the DP approach would involve tracking for each bit, the possible sum, and whether the x is still tight (i.e., whether the current x is equal to m's prefix up to this bit). For each state, we can try setting x_i to 0 or 1, provided that it doesn't violate the m constraint.\n\nSo the DP table can be something like dp[i][sum][tight], representing the maximum sum achievable after processing the first i bits, with a sum of 'sum', and the current x is 'tight' (i.e., whether x is exactly equal to m's prefix up to i bits).\n\nWait, but the sum can be up to 10920, and n is 105, so the state size is 105 * 10920 * 2, which is about 2.3 million. That's manageable.\n\nThe transitions would be as follows:\n\nFor each bit i from 0 to n-1:\n   For each possible sum s in dp[i][tight]:\n      For each possible choice of x_i (0 or 1):\n          if tight is true:\n              if x_i is 1, then check if m's i-th bit is 1. Because if the current x is tight, setting x_i to 1 would require that m's i-th bit is 1. Otherwise, it's invalid.\n              So, if x_i is 1 and m's bit is 0, then this choice is not allowed.\n          else:\n              x_i can be 0 or 1.\n          compute the new_sum = s + a_i if x_i is 1, else s.\n          new_tight is (tight and (x_i == m's bit)) ? true : false.\n          Update dp[i+1][new_sum][new_tight] to be the maximum between its current value and new_sum.\n\nWait, but wait. The bits are processed from the highest (n-1) to the lowest (0). Because each higher bit has a higher weight in x. So the order of processing is from higher to lower bits.\n\nWait, but in the binary string, the leftmost digit is the highest bit. So when processing, the first bit is the most significant.\n\nSo the correct order is to process the bits from the highest (n-1) to the lowest (0).\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read n, a array, and the binary string s.\n\n2. Compute m by converting the binary string s to an integer.\n\n3. Precompute a list of bits of m, from the highest (n-1) to the lowest (0), but wait, no. Because the binary string is s_0 to s_{n-1}, where s_0 is 2^0, s_1 is 2^1, etc. So the bits are ordered from least significant to most significant.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the binary string is s0 s1 s2 ... sn-1, which represents the binary number s0 * 2^0 + s1 * 2^1 + ... + sn-1 * 2^{n-1}.\n\nSo the first character is the least significant bit, the second is 2^1, etc. So the leftmost character is the highest bit.\n\nSo to process from highest to lowest, we need to start from the end of the string and move backward.\n\nWait, for example, the binary string '11010' is 4 bits long, representing 16 + 8 + 2 = 26.\n\nSo s0 is 0, s1 is 1, s2 is 0, s3 is 1, s4 is 1.\n\nBut in terms of bits, the highest is s4 (2^4), then s3 (2^3), etc.\n\nSo, the list of bits for m is s[0], s[1], ..., s[n-1], where s[i] is the i-th bit (2^i). So when processing from highest to lowest, we process s[n-1], s[n-2], ..., s[0].\n\nWait, no. Wait, for i from 0 to n-1, the bit is 2^i. So the highest bit is 2^{n-1}, which is s[n-1].\n\nSo when processing the bits, we need to go from s[n-1] (highest) down to s[0] (lowest).\n\nSo in code, the bits are stored as a list, where bits[i] is the value of s[i] (0 or 1), and the weight is 2^i.\n\nBut in the DP, we'll process the bits from i = n-1 down to 0.\n\nSo, the initial state is at bit i = n-1, sum = 0, tight = True.\n\nWait, but in the DP, the sum starts at 0, and for each bit, we can choose to take it or not, but if tight is True, we can't take it if m's bit is 0.\n\nSo, the DP transition will be as follows:\n\nWe can represent the state as (current_bit, sum_so_far, is_tight). For each state, we can try to set the current bit to 0 or 1, provided that the constraints are met.\n\nWait, but the sum_so_far is the sum of a_i's for the bits set so far. So when we set the current bit to 1, we add a_i to the sum. If we don't set it, the sum remains the same.\n\nSo, during the DP, for each state, we can consider both possibilities (set or not set) for the current bit, and update the next state accordingly.\n\nThe initial state is before processing any bits. So, for the first bit (n-1), we can choose to set it or not, provided that it doesn't make x exceed m.\n\nBut in the DP, for each bit, we process it in order from highest to lowest.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Convert the binary string s into a list of bits, where bits[i] = int(s[i]), and the weight is 2^i.\n\n- Initialize the DP table. The DP will be a dictionary (or a list of dictionaries) where for each bit, we track the possible sums and the tightness.\n\n- Start with bit i = n-1, sum = 0, tight = True.\n\n- For each bit i from n-1 down to 0:\n\n   For each state in the current DP:\n\n      For each possible choice (set or not set):\n\n         if set:\n\n             if tight is True:\n\n                 if m's bit i is 0 → can't set, so skip.\n\n                 else → new_tight = (current bit was set and m's bit is 1) → new_tight is True only if the previous tight was True and the current bit is set to 1 and m's bit is 1.\n\n                 new_sum = sum + a_i.\n\n             else:\n\n                 new_tight = False.\n\n                 new_sum = sum + a_i.\n\n         else:\n\n             new_sum = sum.\n\n             new_tight = (tight and (bit is not set and m's bit is 1)) → wait, no. If the current tight is True, and we don't set the bit, then the new tight depends on whether the bit in m is 1 or 0.\n\n             Wait, no. If we're tight and we don't set the bit, then the new tight is (bit is not set) and (previous tight was True) and (m's bit is 0). Because if m's bit is 0, then not setting the bit keeps x's prefix equal to m's.\n\n             So, new_tight = tight and (x_i == m_i).\n\n             Wait, x_i is 0 if not set, and m_i is the bit at i.\n\n             So, if we are in tight state, and x_i is 0, and m_i is 0 → new_tight is True (since x's prefix is now equal to m's up to i bits).\n\n             If m_i is 1, and we set x_i to 0 → new_tight is False.\n\n             So, in code:\n\n             if tight is True:\n\n                 new_tight = (x_i == m_i)\n\n             else:\n\n                 new_tight = False.\n\nSo, putting it all together, for each state (sum, tight), and each possible choice (set or not set), we compute the new_sum and new_tight.\n\nWe can represent the DP as a list of dictionaries, where for each bit, we have a dictionary mapping sum values to the maximum sum achieved for that sum and tightness.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nInitialize dp as a list of dictionaries. Each dp[i] will represent the states after processing the i-th bit.\n\ndp starts with dp[-1] being the initial state, but perhaps it's better to process from high to low.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to process from i = n-1 down to 0.\n\nLet me outline the code steps:\n\n1. Read n, a array, s string.\n\n2. Compute m by converting s to an integer.\n\n3. Precompute the bits for each position. For i in 0 to n-1, bits[i] = (s[i] == '1').\n\n4. Precompute the a array as a list, a[i] is the value for the i-th bit.\n\n5. Initialize the DP. We can represent the DP as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary is keyed by sum and has a boolean indicating whether the state is tight.\n\n6. Start with the initial state before processing any bits: sum 0, tight True.\n\n7. For each bit i from n-1 down to 0:\n\n   For each state in dp[i]:\n\n      current_sum = state's sum.\n\n      is_tight = state's tightness.\n\n      for choice in [0, 1]:\n\n          if choice is 1:\n\n              if is_tight and not bits[i]:\n\n                  # can't set this bit because m's bit is 0 and we are tight.\n\n                  continue.\n\n              new_sum = current_sum + a[i]\n\n              if is_tight:\n\n                  new_tight = (bits[i] == 1)\n\n              else:\n\n                  new_tight = False\n\n              # Now, add this new state to the next bit's DP.\n\n              if new_sum not in dp[i+1][new_tight]:\n\n                  dp[i+1][new_tight][new_sum] = True\n\n              else:\n\n                  # Keep the maximum sum, but since we're processing from highest to lowest, each sum is unique.\n\n                  # Actually, for each state, we can keep track of the maximum sum.\n\n                  # Maybe the sum can be updated, but I think in this problem, each sum is achievable only once.\n\n                  pass\n\n          else:\n\n              # choice is 0.\n\n              new_sum = current_sum\n\n              if is_tight:\n\n                  new_tight = (bits[i] == 0)\n\n              else:\n\n                  new_tight = False\n\n              # Add to next DP.\n\n              if new_sum not in dp[i+1][new_tight]:\n\n                  dp[i+1][new_tight][new_sum] = True\n\n              else:\n\n                  pass\n\n8. After processing all bits, the maximum sum across all possible states in dp[n] is the answer.\n\nWait, but the DP structure needs to be correctly built. Let's see:\n\n- Initially, at i = n, dp[n] is empty.\n\n- For i = n-1, we process the first bit (highest), and for each choice (0 or 1), add the new state to dp[n].\n\nThen, for i = n-2, process each state in dp[n], and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the DP is represented as a list where dp[i] represents the states after processing the i-th bit.\n\nWait, perhaps I should index the bits from 0 to n-1, and process from the last (n-1) to the first (0). So for each i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n\n   For each state in dp[i], process the choice of setting or not setting the i-th bit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the DP as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary corresponds to the possible sum and tightness after processing up to the i-th bit.\n\nSo, for each bit i (starting from 0 to n-1), we process it, and for each state in the current DP, we generate new states for the next bit.\n\nBut perhaps the initial approach is to represent the DP as a list of dictionaries, where for each bit position, we have a dictionary that maps (sum, tight) to a value, but in this problem, the value isn't needed—only the existence of the state matters.\n\nWait, no. Because multiple paths can lead to the same sum and tightness, but the maximum sum is the one we need. So for each state (sum, tight), we can track the maximum sum.\n\nWait, no, because for each state, the sum is fixed. So for each state, the sum is the key, and the tightness is a flag.\n\nSo, for each state, the sum is the key, and the tightness is a parameter.\n\nSo, the DP can be represented as a list of dictionaries, where each entry in the dictionary is a sum value, and the presence of the key indicates that this sum is achievable with the corresponding tightness.\n\nSo, the initial state is sum=0, tight=True.\n\nProcessing each bit, for each state, we consider both choices (set or not set), compute the new sum and new tightness, and add them to the next state.\n\nOnce all bits are processed, the maximum sum is the maximum key in the final DP.\n\nBut wait, the final DP is for the 0th bit. So after processing all bits, the maximum sum is the maximum key in dp[0].\n\nWait, no. Because the bits are processed from highest to lowest, so the 0th bit is processed last. So the final DP is for i=0.\n\nSo after processing all bits, the maximum sum is the maximum key in dp[0], considering all possible tightness.\n\nWait, no, because after processing all bits, the tightness is irrelevant because all bits have been processed. So the maximum sum is the maximum key in dp[0].\n\nBut perhaps I should think of it as the DP starts with i = n-1, and after processing all bits, the state is at i=0.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nInitialize dp as a list of dictionaries. dp[0] starts with sum=0, tight=True.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to have dp as a list where each element represents the state after processing the i-th bit. So for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reorganize the processing order.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nStart with the highest bit (n-1), and process down to 0.\n\nAt each step, for each state, consider setting or not setting the current bit.\n\nSo, the initial state is sum=0, tight=True, before processing any bits.\n\nThen, for each bit i from n-1 downto 0:\n\n   create a new_dp for the next bit (i+1).\n\n   for each state in dp[i]:\n\n       current_sum, current_tight = state.\n\n       for choice in 0, 1:\n\n           if choice == 1:\n\n               if current_tight and (bits[i] == 0):\n\n                   # can't set this bit.\n\n                   continue.\n\n               new_sum = current_sum + a[i]\n\n               new_tight = current_tight and (bits[i] == 1)\n\n           else:\n\n               new_sum = current_sum\n\n               new_tight = current_tight and (bits[i] == 0)\n\n           # Now, add this new state to new_dp.\n\n           if new_sum not in new_dp[new_tight]:\n\n               new_dp[new_tight][new_sum] = True\n\n   dp[i+1] = new_dp\n\nWait, but in code, perhaps we can represent dp as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary holds the sum and tightness.\n\nSo, the initial dp is { (sum=0, tight=True) }.\n\nThen, for each i from n-1 downto 0:\n\n   create a new empty dictionary for the next state.\n\n   for each state in dp:\n\n       sum_s, is_tight = state.\n\n       for choice in 0, 1:\n\n           if choice == 1:\n\n               if is_tight and not bits[i]:\n\n                   continue.\n\n               new_sum = sum_s + a[i]\n\n               new_is_tight = is_tight and (bits[i] == 1)\n\n           else:\n\n               new_sum = sum_s\n\n               new_is_tight = is_tight and (bits[i] == 0)\n\n           # Now, add to the new dictionary.\n\n           key = (new_sum, new_is_tight)\n\n           if key not in new_dp:\n\n               new_dp[key] = True\n\n   dp = new_dp.copy()\n\nWait, but in Python, handling dictionaries with tuples as keys may be a bit tricky. Alternatively, for each state, we can track the sum and tightness as separate variables.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the state as a tuple (sum, is_tight). So for each step, we process each state in the current DP, and for each choice, we compute the new state and add it to the next DP.\n\nSo, the code would look something like this:\n\nbits = [int(c) for c in s]\na = list of a_i's.\n\ndp = { (0, True): None }  # sum 0, tight=True.\n\nfor i in reversed(range(n)):\n    new_dp = {}\n    for (sum_s, is_tight) in dp:\n        for choice in [0, 1]:\n            if choice == 1:\n                if is_tight and not bits[i]:\n                    # Can't set this bit, since m's bit is 0 and we're tight.\n                    continue\n                new_sum = sum_s + a[i]\n                new_is_tight = is_tight and (bits[i] == 1)\n            else:\n                new_sum = sum_s\n                new_is_tight = is_tight and (bits[i] == 0)\n            # Now, check if this new state is valid.\n            if (new_sum, new_is_tight) in new_dp:\n                # We've already seen this state, so no need to add again.\n                continue\n            new_dp[(new_sum, new_is_tight)] = True\n    dp = new_dp\n\nFinally, the maximum sum is the maximum key in dp.values(), looking for the maximum sum across all possible states.\n\nWait, but after processing all bits, the state is at i=0, which is the least significant bit.\n\nSo, the maximum sum is the maximum of all the sums in the final dp.\n\nSo, the code would collect all the sums from the final dp and take the maximum.\n\nBut wait, some sums may not be possible. For example, if in the final state, the sum is 0, but other sums are higher.\n\nSo, the maximum sum is the maximum value of the keys in dp.\n\nIn Python, to get the maximum sum, we can do max(sum for (sum, is_tight) in dp.keys()).\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nBut let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=2\n\na = [3, 8]\n\nbinary string s = '10'\n\nSo, m is 10 (binary 1010?), wait no.\n\nWait, s is '10', which is two bits.\n\nWait, the binary string is '10', which is 2 bits. So s[0] is '1' → 2^0 *1 =1, s[1] is '0' → 2^1 *0=0. So m is 1.\n\nWait, but the sample input says m=20, which is 10100 in binary. Wait, perhaps the sample input is misrepresented.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's sample:\n\nIn the first test case, m=20, which is 10100 in binary, which is 5 bits. So n is 2, but the binary string is 5 bits long. Wait, that can't be. Because the input says the third line is a binary string of length n. So perhaps the sample is not accurately represented.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is incorrect, but regardless, let's proceed.\n\nAnother sample is:\n\nInput:\n\n['2\\n3 8\\n10', '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010']\n\nSo, n=2, a = [3,8], and s is '10' → m is 2 (binary 10 is 2). But the note says m=20, which is 10100 in binary. So perhaps the sample's s is longer than n.\n\nHmm, perhaps the sample is incorrect. But regardless, let's proceed.\n\nIn the first sample, the function f(x) is computed for x up to m=20.\n\nWait, perhaps the binary string is longer than n. So perhaps the problem statement allows m to have more bits than n? No, the binary string is given as s_0 to s_{n-1}, which is exactly n bits. So m is a number with exactly n bits.\n\nSo, perhaps the sample is incorrect in the description, but the code should process it correctly.\n\nIn any case, the code should handle any m correctly.\n\nSo, to recap, the plan is to model the problem as a 0-1 knapsack where each item is a bit, with weight 2^i and value a_i, and the sum of weights must not exceed m.\n\nBut with the standard DP approach being infeasible due to the large m, we use a state-based DP that tracks the sum and whether the current x is tight (exactly matching m's prefix up to this bit).\n\nThe code processes the bits from highest to lowest, and for each state, considers setting or not setting the current bit, updating the sum and tightness accordingly.\n\nThis approach should be efficient enough for the constraints, as the sum can be up to 10920, and the number of states is manageable.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nFirst, read the inputs.\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nCompute m: m is the integer value of the binary string s.\n\nBut wait, the binary string is s_0 s_1 ... s_{n-1}, which represents m as sum(s_i * 2^i).\n\nSo, m = int(s, 2)\n\nBut wait, the binary string is given as a string of '0's and '1's, so using int(s, 2) should work.\n\nThen, process each bit.\n\nbits = [int(c) for c in s]\n\nThen, initialize the DP.\n\ndp = {(0, True): None}\n\nBut perhaps it's better to use a dictionary where each key is a tuple (sum, is_tight), and the value is",
