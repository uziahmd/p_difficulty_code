A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain resources: drink, lime slices, and salt. I need to calculate the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given the available resources.\n\nLet's break down the input variables:\n\n- n: number of friends\n- k: number of bottles of drink\n- l: milliliters per bottle\n- c: number of limes cut into slices\n- d: slices per lime, so total slices are c * d\n- p: grams of salt\n- nl: milliliters of drink needed per toast per friend\n- np: grams of salt needed per toast per friend\n\nEach toast for all friends requires each person to have their own set. So, for one toast, each friend needs nl ml, one slice, and np grams.\n\nSo, let's think about the total resources required for a certain number of toasts, say t.\n\n1. Drink: For each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So total drink required is n * t * nl. We have k * l ml available. So the maximum t allowed by drink is (k * l) // (n * nl).\n\n2. Lime slices: Each toast uses one slice per friend. So for t toasts, each friend uses t slices. So total slices needed is n * t. The total available is c * d. So t_max_lime = (c * d) // n.\n\n3. Salt: Each toast per friend needs np grams. So per toast, total salt used is n * np. Total available is p. So t_max_salt = p // (n * np).\n\nThe actual maximum number of toasts is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but in the note, the first sample says that the drink allows 6 toasts (20ml /3), which is 6 toasts. But then it's divided by 3 because each friend makes 2 toasts? Wait no, wait: in the sample, the output is 2 toasts per friend. Hmm.\n\nWait, the sample input is 3 friends. Let me recalculate:\n\nDrink: 4 bottles *5ml=20ml. Each toast, each friend needs 3ml. So per toast, 3 friends need 3*3=9ml. So total toasts possible from drink: 20 /9 = 2.222, so 2 toasts.\n\nLime: 10 limes *8 slices =80 slices. Each toast, each friend needs 1 slice. So per toast, 3 slices. So 80 /3 is 26.666, so 26 toasts.\n\nSalt: 100g. Each toast, 3 friends need 1g each. So 3g per toast. 100/3 =33.333, so 33 toasts.\n\nBut the maximum possible is the minimum of 2,26,33, which is 2. So each friend can make 2 toasts.\n\nAh, right! So the initial approach was correct. So the steps are:\n\nCompute the maximum possible toasts based on each resource, then take the minimum.\n\nSo the formula is t = min( (k*l)/(n * nl), (c*d)/n, p/(n * np) )\n\nWait, but since all are integer divisions, we need to compute floor division.\n\nSo in Python, using integer division with '//' operator.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\n1. Read the input line as a list of integers.\n\n2. Compute each resource's contribution.\n\nFor each resource:\n\n- Drink: (k * l) // (n * nl)\n- Lime: (c * d) // n\n- Salt: p // (n * np)\n\n3. The maximum number of toasts is the minimum of the above three.\n\n4. Output that number as a string.\n\nWait, what if any of these divisions result in zero? Like if there's not enough for even one toast. Then the output is zero, which is correct.\n\nSo now, let's think about the code.\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is a single line with 8 integers. So:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute each component:\n\ndrink_toasts = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlime_toasts = (c * d) // n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nmax_toasts = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nPrint max_toasts as a string.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, when the first case is:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1']\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nCompute drink_toasts: (4*5) =20, divided by (3*3)=9 → 20//9=2.\n\nlime_toasts: (10*8)=80, divided by 3 → 26.\n\nsalt_toasts: 100/(3*1)=33.\n\nmin is 2 → correct.\n\nAnother test case: the second input is 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3.\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → drink: 1000ml. Each toast per friend is 4ml, so per toast all friends use 5*4=20ml. So 1000//20=50.\n\nLime: c=1, d=19 → 19 slices. Divided by 5 → 3.\n\nSalt: p=90, per toast each friend needs 3g, so per toast total 15g. 90//15=6.\n\nSo min(50,3,6) is 3. So output is 3.\n\nThird test case: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1.\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → drink: 1000*1000=1e6, divided by (10*50)=500 → 1e6 /500=2000.\n\nLime: 25 *23=575, divided by 10→57.\n\nSalt: 1/(10*1)=0.1 → 0.\n\nSo min(2000,57,0) is 0. So output is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where any of the denominators are zero? Well, the constraints say all numbers are positive, so n, nl, np are at least 1. So no division by zero issues.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, implement it.\n\nRead the inputs, compute each value, take the min, print as string.\n\nSo the code will be:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlime = (c * d) // n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\nprint(min(drink, lime, salt))\n\nYes, that should do it.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Resources**: Each toast requires:\n   - `nl` milliliters of drink per friend.\n   - 1 lime slice per friend.\n   - `np` grams of salt per friend.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**:\n   - **Drink**: The total amount of drink available is `k * l` milliliters. Each toast for all friends uses `n * nl` milliliters. Thus, the maximum number of toasts possible from the drink is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n   - **Lime Slices**: The total number of lime slices is `c * d`. Each toast requires one slice per friend, so the maximum number of toasts possible from lime slices is `(c * d) // n`.\n   - **Salt**: The total salt available is `p` grams. Each toast requires `n * np` grams, so the maximum number of toasts possible from salt is `p // (n * np)`.\n\n3. **Determine the Limiting Resource**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the smallest value among the three calculated resources.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlime = (c * d) // n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\nprint(min(drink, lime, salt))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input values are read and parsed into respective variables.\n- **Calculating Toasts from Each Resource**: For each resource (drink, lime slices, salt), we compute the maximum number of toasts possible based on the available quantity.\n- **Finding the Minimum**: The actual maximum number of toasts each friend can make is determined by the minimum value among the three computed resources, as this represents the limiting factor.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make while respecting all constraints.",
