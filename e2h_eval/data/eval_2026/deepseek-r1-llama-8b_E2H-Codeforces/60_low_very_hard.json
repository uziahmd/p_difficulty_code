Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the number of valid Morse code substrings after each step of building a string S. Hmm, let's try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that each Morse code letter is represented by a string of 1-4 characters, consisting of 0s and 1s. But not all possible combinations are valid. There are four invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So any substring in S that corresponds exactly to one of these four shouldn't be counted as a valid English letter.\n\nWait, but the problem isn't just about counting valid letters. It's about counting all possible non-empty substrings that represent some valid letter. So for each position in S, I need to look at all possible substrings starting or ending there and check if they form a valid Morse code.\n\nBut considering that m can be up to 3000, a naive approach of checking every possible substring each time would be way too slow. I need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Maybe I can track for each position in S, the number of valid substrings ending at that position. That sounds promising.\n\nSo, for each new character added to S, I'll look back a few steps (up to 4 steps before) and see if the substring from i-3 to i, i-2 to i, etc., forms a valid Morse code. Then, I can sum the counts for all such valid substrings ending at i.\n\nBut wait, how do I efficiently check if a substring of length l (l being 1,2,3,4) is valid? One approach is to precompute all valid Morse codes and store them in a set. Then, for any substring, I can check if its corresponding binary string is in this set.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me create a list of all valid Morse codes. According to the problem statement, the total valid codes are 26 letters, each with unique codes except those four invalid ones. Wait, no—wait, the problem says that each of the four strings does not correspond to any letter. So the total number of valid Morse codes is 30 (all possible 1-4 bit strings) minus 4, which equals 26. So each valid Morse code is unique and represents a distinct letter.\n\nSo first, I'll generate all valid Morse codes. But wait, how? Because I don't have the mapping from letters to Morse, but I know the four invalid codes. Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows me to consider all possible 1-4 length binary strings except those four. So the valid codes are all binary strings of lengths 1,2,3,4 except those four.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"each string of '0' and/or '1' of length at most 4 translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings...\" So, the valid Morse codes are all possible binary strings of length 1-4 except those four. So, for example, a 3-character string like '000' is valid because it's not among the four invalid ones.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute all valid Morse codes (strings of 0s and 1s of lengths 1-4, excluding the four given strings).\n2. For each step when we add a new character to S, determine all possible substrings ending at this position that form a valid Morse code.\n3. Sum the counts for each such occurrence.\n\nBut how do I efficiently compute this for each new character?\n\nMaybe for each position i (starting from 0), I look back up to 4 positions and check if the substring s[i - l + 1 ... i] is a valid Morse code. Then, for each such valid substring, add 1 to the total count.\n\nBut this approach could be O(m*4), which is manageable since m is 3000.\n\nWait, but that's only looking at substrings of lengths 1 to 4. So for each i, I consider the last 1, 2, 3, 4 characters, including i. But wait, the substring can't be longer than i+1, because i starts from 0. Hmm, maybe for i=0, the substring can only be length 1. For i=1, substrings of length 1 and 2, etc.\n\nWait, no. For each new character, I should look back 1, 2, 3, 4 positions, but not more than what's available. For example, if i is the current index (assuming 0-based), then the possible substrings ending at i are s[i], s[i-1..i], s[i-2..i], s[i-3..i], s[i-4..i], but only if i-3 >=0 for the 4-length substring.\n\nSo for each new",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of valid Morse code substrings after each modification to a string S. Each modification appends either a dot ('0') or a dash ('1') to S. A valid Morse code substring corresponds to a unique English letter and is of length 1 to 4, excluding four specific invalid strings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Valid Morse Codes**: Generate all valid Morse codes of lengths 1 to 4, excluding the four invalid strings.\n2. **Dynamic Programming**: Use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of valid Morse code substrings ending at each position in S.\n3. **Check Substrings**: For each new character added to S, check all possible substrings ending at this character (of lengths 1 to 4) to see if they form a valid Morse code.\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the results can be very large, use modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to keep the numbers manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n# Precompute all valid Morse codes\nvalid_codes = set()\nfor l in range(1, 5):\n    for code in ['0'] * l + ['1'] * l:\n        # Generate all possible combinations\n        s = ''.join(['0' if i % 2 == 0 else '1' for i in range(l)])\n        # Skip the invalid codes\n        if s not in {'0011', '0101', '1110', '1111'}:\n            valid_codes.add(s)\n\n# Now, for each step, track the possible endings\nprev_states = [0] * 5  # dp[i]: count ending with i steps back (i=1 to 4)\ntotal = 0\n\nm = int(input())\nfor _ in range(m):\n    c = input().strip()\n    \n    # Update the current character's states\n    new_dp = [0] * 5\n    for l in range(1, 5):\n        if len(c) >= l:\n            substring = c[-l:]\n            if substring in valid_codes:\n                # Look back up to l-1 steps\n                # The sum of prev_states for positions 1 to l-1\n                sum_prev = sum(prev_states[1:l])\n                new_dp[l] = sum_prev\n        else:\n            new_dp[l] = 0\n    \n    # Merge the new_dp into prev_states\n    for i in range(1, 5):\n        prev_states[i] += new_dp[i]\n        if prev_states[i] >= MOD:\n            prev_states[i] -= MOD\n    \n    # Calculate the total by summing all possible new endings\n    current_total = sum(prev_states[1:5]) % MOD\n    print(current_total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Valid Codes**: We generate all possible binary strings of lengths 1 to 4 and exclude the four invalid strings.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: `prev_states` keeps track of the number of valid substrings ending at each position. It has 5 elements where `prev_states[i]` represents substrings ending at the current position and having length `i`.\n3. **Update for Each Character**: For each new character, we check all possible substrings ending at this character (lengths 1 to 4). If a substring is valid, we update the corresponding entry in `new_dp`.\n4. **Sum and Modulo**: After updating `prev_states`, we compute the total number of valid substrings by summing all entries in `prev_states` and apply modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks valid substrings using dynamic programming, ensuring that each step is processed in constant time, making the solution scalable for up to 3000 modifications.",
