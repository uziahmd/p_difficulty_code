After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the number of successful students in a group. A student is considered successful if there's at least one subject where they are the best. Being the best means that no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\nHmm, so for each subject, I need to determine which student has the maximum mark. Then, for each student, check if they are the maximum in any subject.\n\nLet me think about the steps I need to take.\n\nFirst, I'll read the input. The input starts with two integers n and m. Then there are n lines, each representing a student's grades for m subjects. Each line is a string of m characters, each being a digit from 1 to 9.\n\nFor each subject (from 0 to m-1), I need to find the maximum mark among all students. Then, for each student, I'll check if their mark in that subject is equal to the maximum. If yes, then the student is a candidate for being the best in that subject.\n\nWait, but how do I track which student is the best in each subject? Because for each subject, only one student can be the best. So for each subject, I'll find the student(s) who have the maximum mark. But since it's possible to have multiple students with the same max, but only one of them can be considered as the best, right? Or wait, no. The definition says a student is the best in a subject if no one else has a higher mark. So if multiple students have the same max, they are all considered the best in that subject.\n\nWait, the note in the problem says: \"Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\" So if multiple students have the maximum mark, they are all the best in that subject. So for each such student, they get a count towards being successful.\n\nWait, no. Wait, suppose in a subject, two students have the same maximum mark. Then both of them are the best in that subject because none have a higher mark than them. So each of them would count as being the best in that subject.\n\nSo for example, if in a subject, three students have marks 5, 5, 4. Then the first two are both best in that subject. So each of those two students gets a success point.\n\nOh right, that makes sense. So the problem is not just to find one student per subject, but for each subject, all students who have the maximum mark in that subject contribute to the count of successful students.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each subject, find the maximum mark among all students.\n2. For each student, count how many subjects they are the maximum in. If the count is at least one, the student is successful.\n3. Sum up all such students.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the count is not per student; rather, for each subject, all students who have the max in that subject contribute to their own success. So for each subject, for each student who has the max in that subject, add one to their success count.\n\nWait, yes. So the plan is:\n\n- For each subject:\n   - Find the maximum mark in that subject across all students.\n   - For each student, check if their mark in that subject equals the maximum.\n   - For each such student, increment their success counter by 1.\n\nOnce we've processed all subjects, the number of students with a success counter >=1 is our answer.\n\nSo how to implement this?\n\nLet me outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line is n and m. Then, read n lines, each line is a string of length m. For each line, we can split it into individual characters, each representing a subject's mark for that student.\n\nBut wait, each line is a string like '223', which represents m=3 subjects: 2, 2, 3.\n\nSo for each student, we can represent their marks as a list of integers or strings.\n\nWe can create a 2D array where rows are students and columns are subjects. For example, student_scores[i][j] is the mark of student i in subject j.\n\nThen, for each subject j (from 0 to m-1):\n\n   max_mark = the maximum value in student_scores[:, j]\n\n   for each student i:\n\n      if student_scores[i][j] == max_mark:\n\n          add 1 to their success count.\n\nFinally, count the number of students whose success count is >=1.\n\nThat's the plan.\n\nSo, let's think about data structures.\n\nWe can represent the student scores as a list of lists. Each inner list represents a student's marks across subjects.\n\nThen, for each subject, iterate through each student to see if their mark is the maximum.\n\nNow, let's think about handling",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks across multiple subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students `n` and the number of subjects `m`.\n2. **Data Representation**: Store each student's marks in a 2D list where each row represents a student and each column represents a subject.\n3. **Subject-wise Analysis**: For each subject, determine the maximum mark achieved by any student. Identify all students who have this maximum mark in that subject.\n4. **Count Successes**: For each student, count how many subjects they are the best in. If a student is the best in at least one subject, they are marked as successful.\n5. **Result Calculation**: Sum up the number of successful students.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    student_marks = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students.append(student_marks)\n\nsuccess_count = [0] * n\n\nfor subject in range(m):\n    max_mark = -1\n    for student in students:\n        if student[subject] > max_mark:\n            max_mark = student[subject]\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][subject] == max_mark:\n            success_count[i] += 1\n\nsuccessful = sum(1 for cnt in success_count if cnt >= 1)\nprint(successful)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). Each subsequent line represents a student's marks for each subject.\n2. **Storing Marks**: Each student's marks are stored in a list of lists, where each inner list corresponds to a student's marks across all subjects.\n3. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject, iterate through all students to find the maximum mark. This helps in identifying which students are the best in that subject.\n4. **Counting Successful Students**: For each subject, increment the success count for each student who has the maximum mark in that subject.\n5. **Calculating Result**: Finally, count how many students have at least one success, indicating they are successful in at least one subject.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each subject and determines the successful students by leveraging nested loops and simple counting mechanisms.",
