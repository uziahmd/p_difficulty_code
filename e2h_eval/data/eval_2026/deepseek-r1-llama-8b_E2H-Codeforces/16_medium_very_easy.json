Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a plane with n infinite line roads. Each road is given by the equation a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0. These roads divide the plane into blocks. The home and university are in some blocks, not on any road. I need to find the minimal number of steps to get from home to university. A step is moving from one block to another if they share a border of non-zero length. So, moving through an intersection point doesn't count as a step because their shared boundary is just a point, which has zero length.\n\nHmm, so how do I model this? Well, each road is a line that divides the plane. The key idea here is probably to determine for each road whether the home and university are on the same side or different sides. Because each time you cross a road (i.e., move from one block to another adjacent via that road), that's like switching sides of that road.\n\nWait, right! Because each road can split the plane into two half-planes. If home and university are on opposite sides of the road, then you must cross that road an odd number of times, contributing to the total steps. But if they are on the same side, you don't need to cross that road at all.\n\nSo the minimal number of steps required is equal to the number of roads for which home and university are on opposite sides. Because each such road must be crossed once, and each crossing contributes one step.\n\nThat makes sense. Because each crossing of such a road will take you from one block to another. And since the roads are independent (in terms of how they partition the plane), the total number of steps is just the count of such roads.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each road, compute whether home and university are on the same side or different sides.\n2. Count the number of roads where they are on opposite sides. That count is the answer.\n\nHow do I check if two points are on the same side of a line?\n\nThe line equation is a*x + b*y + c = 0. For a point (x0, y0), substitute into the equation: a*x0 + b*y0 + c. The sign tells us on which side of the line the point lies.\n\nIf the value is positive, the point is on one side; if negative, on the other; if zero, on the line. But in our case, the points are guaranteed not to lie on any road, so we don't have to handle zero.\n\nSo for each road, compute f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c, and f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If f1 and f2 have the same sign (both positive or both negative), then the points are on the same side of the road. Otherwise, they are on opposite sides.\n\nSo for each road, we calculate the product of f1 and f2. If the product is positive, same side; if negative, opposite sides.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward:\n\n- Read home (x1, y1), university (x2, y2).\n- Read n roads.\n- For each road, compute f1 and f2.\n- Check if f1 * f2 < 0 → count += 1.\n- The answer is count.\n\nLet me test this logic with the example provided.\n\nExample Input:\nHome: 1 1\nUniversity: -1 -1\nn=3\n\nRoads:\n1. 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y=0. Home is at y=1 (positive side), University is at y=-1 (negative). So they are on opposite sides. So this road counts.\n\n2. 1x + 0y + 0 = 0 → x=0. Home is at x=1 (positive), University at x=-1 (negative). Opposite sides. Counts.\n\n3. 1x + 1y -3 =0. Let's compute for home: 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3=-1. For university: (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) -3 = -1-1-3=-5. Both negative, same side. Doesn't count.\n\nSo total is 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nNow, what about handling the calculation accurately? We have to avoid integer overflows, but in Python, that's not a problem. Also, since the numbers can be as large as 1e6 in magnitude, but in Python, integers can be big, so no issues.\n\nSo the steps to implement:\n\nRead x1, y1.\nRead x2, y2.\nRead n.\nFor each of n lines:\n    Read a, b, c.\n    Compute f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n    Compute f2 = a*x2 + b*x2 + c\n    if (f1 * f2) < 0 → increment count.\nReturn count.\n\nSo code-wise, in Python:\n\nWe'll read the input lines, parse them, and process each road.\n\nWait, the home and university are given as strings in the sample input, but in the actual problem, it's standard input as separate lines. So the first line is x1 y1, second x2 y2, third n, followed by n lines of a, b, c.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nYes, that should do it.\n\nTesting with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n1 1\n-1 -1\n2\n0 1 0 → y=0 → val1=1, val2=-1 → product -1 <0 → count 1.\n1 0 0 → x=0 → val1=1, val2=-1 → product -1 <0 → count 2.\n\nSo output is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: suppose home and university are on same side for all roads. Then count is 0.\n\nWhat if there's a road where val1 and val2 are both positive: same side, no count.\n\nWhat about when val1 and val2 are both negative: same, no count.\n\nOnly when their product is negative, count increases.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think this handles all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town. Each step allows moving from one block to another if they share a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem can be simplified by understanding that each road (line) divides the plane into two half-planes. If your home and university are on opposite sides of a road, you must cross that road at least once. Conversely, if they are on the same side, you do not need to cross that road.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each road, we check if the home and university lie on opposite sides. This can be determined by evaluating the sign of the expression \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) for both points. If the signs differ, the points are on opposite sides of the road.\n3. **Algorithm**: \n   - Read the coordinates of home and university.\n   - For each road, compute the value of the linear equation at both home and university.\n   - Count how many roads have opposite signs for these values, indicating a crossing is needed.\n4. **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently processes each road in constant time, resulting in an overall time complexity of \\(O(n)\\), which is optimal given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, starting with the coordinates of home and university, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n- **Evaluating Roads**: For each road, the values of the linear equation at home and university are computed. If these values have opposite signs, it indicates that the road needs to be crossed.\n- **Counting Crossings**: The total number of such crossings is counted and printed as the result, representing the minimum steps needed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum steps required by leveraging the geometric properties of lines dividing the plane.",
