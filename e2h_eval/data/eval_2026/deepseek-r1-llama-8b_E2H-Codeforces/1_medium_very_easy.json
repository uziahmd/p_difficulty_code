    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I calculate the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. Let's see what the problem says.\n\nThe plate is w rows by h columns. We have k rings to gild. Each ring is a border around an inner rectangle that's getting smaller each time. The first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away from the edge, and so on.\n\nHmm, each ring contributes some cells. So for each i from 1 to k, I need to find the number of cells in that ring and sum them all up.\n\nWait, how do I calculate the number of cells for each ring? Let me think about it.\n\nFor the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h -4*(i-1)). Because each ring reduces both width and height by 2 on each side. So for each layer, it's subtracting 2 from both ends, so 4 in total per step.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let's clarify. For each ring, the size reduces by 2 on each side. So for example, the original is w x h. The first ring is around it, which has a perimeter of 2*(w + h) -4, but wait, no—because the corners are counted twice if you just do 2*(w + h). So the correct formula for the perimeter is 2*(w + h) - 4. Because for a rectangle, the perimeter is 2*(width + height) -4, since each corner is counted once instead of four times when considering the outer loop.\n\nSo for each ring, we can compute its perimeter as 2*(current_w + current_h) -4, where current_w and current_h are the dimensions of that ring's rectangle.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, each ring is the border of the inner rectangle. So for the i-th ring, the inner rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h -4*(i-1)). So for each i, starting at 1, we calculate the perimeter of that rectangle.\n\nBut wait, what happens when i increases beyond a certain point? Because after a few steps, the inner rectangle might become too small to form a ring.\n\nBut according to the input constraints, k is such that it won't cause any issues. So for each i from 1 to k, we can safely compute the perimeter.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nFor i from 1 to k:\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\n    add perimeter to total\n\nReturn total\n\nLet me test this with the examples given.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput: 3 3 1\n\ncurrent_w = 3, current_h=3\n\nperimeter = 2*(3+3) -4 = 12-4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example:\n\n7 9 1.\n\ncurrent_w=7, current_h=9.\n\nperimeter = 2*(16) -4=32-4=28. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2.\n\nFor i=1: 7*9: perimeter 2*(16)-4=28.\n\ni=2: current_w=7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5.\n\nperimeter is 2*(3+5)-4= 16-4=12. Wait, 3x5 perimeter is 2*(8) -4 = 12.\n\nSo 28+12=40, which is correct.\n\nYes, that seems to work.\n\nSo the plan is to loop through each ring, compute the perimeter for each, sum them up.\n\nNow, in code.\n\nRead w, h, k from input.\n\nInitialize total =0.\n\nLoop i in 1..k:\n\n   cw = w -4*(i-1)\n\n   ch = h -4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2*(cw + ch) -4\n\n   total += perimeter\n\nPrint total.\n\nBut wait, what if cw or ch becomes less than or equal to zero? But according to the problem statement, k is constrained so that this doesn't happen.\n\nSo the code should be straightforward.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code.\n\nRead the input line as a list, split into three integers.\n\nThen loop from 1 to k inclusive.\n\nSum the perimeters.\n\nFinally, print the total as a string.\n\nSo code:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal =0\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    cw = w -4*(i-1)\n    ch = h -4*(i-1)\n    perimeter = 2*(cw + ch) -4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n\nTesting this with the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\n3 3 1 → 8.\n\nSample 2:\n\n7 9 1 → 28.\n\nSample 3:\n\n7 9 2 → 28 + 12=40.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: let's say w=5, h=5, k=2.\n\nRing 1: 5x5 → perimeter 2*(10)-4=16.\n\nRing 2: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. So 1x1. Perimeter is 2*(2) -4=0. So total is 16+0=16.\n\nBut wait, does a 1x1 have a perimeter? Because the perimeter would be the four sides, but each side is 1 cell. So the perimeter is 4 cells.\n\nWait, wait! Did I make a mistake here?\n\nWait, for a 1x1 square, the perimeter is 4 cells because each side is length 1. So the calculation 2*(1+1) -4=0 is wrong.\n\nHmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, I think my initial approach is incorrect for cases where the current_w or current_h is less than 2.\n\nBecause for a 1x1, the perimeter is 4 cells, not 0.\n\nSo my formula works when the rectangle is at least 2x2, but for smaller ones, it's not correct.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the rings must be formed by the border of the inner rectangle. So for a 1x1, perhaps it's considered a single cell, but that's not a ring because a ring requires a border.\n\nWait, maybe the problem assumes that each ring is valid, i.e., the inner rectangle has at least 2 cells in each dimension beyond the previous ring.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input constraints ensure that k is such that it's possible. So perhaps in our code, we don't have to handle cases where cw or ch is less than 2.\n\nWait, but for the case where w=5, h=5, k=2.\n\nAfter i=1, the inner rectangle is 5-4=1 row and 5-4=1 column. That's 1x1. But according to the problem statement, a ring is formed by the border of the inner rectangle. So for 1x1, is there a ring? Or is it not considered a ring because it's just a single cell.\n\nHmm, but the problem statement's third example is 7x9 with k=2. For i=2, the rectangle is 3x5, which is fine.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct only when the current_w and current_h are >=2.\n\nBecause for a 2x2 square, the perimeter is 2*(2+2) -4= 8-4=4, which is correct.\n\nFor 3x3: 2*(6) -4=8, correct.\n\nBut for 1x1: the formula gives 0, but the actual count is 1, but perhaps in the problem, such a ring isn't considered because the inner rectangle can't form a ring.\n\nWait, but the problem's input constraints say that k is at most floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ), which for w=h=5, min is 5. (5+1)/4=1.5, floor is 1. So k can't be more than 1. So in this case, the code is okay.\n\nWait, let's take another example. Suppose w=5, h=5, k=1.\n\nThen the code correctly adds 2*(5+5) -4=20-4=16.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWhat if someone inputs w=3, h=3, k=1: correct.\n\nWhat about w=2, h=2, k=1. Then the formula gives 2*(2+2) -4= 8-4=4. But for a 2x2 grid, the perimeter is indeed 4 cells.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nWhat about when the inner rectangle is 1x1. Like, for i=2 when w=5, h=5, but then the code would compute 2*(1+1)-4= 0. But that's invalid because 1x1 can't form a ring.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input ensures that k is such that it doesn't go beyond the maximum possible rings.\n\nSo for w=5, h=5, the maximum k is 1, because (5+1)/4=1.5, floor is 1.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nSo perhaps the formula works correctly for all cases within the problem's constraints.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is formed along the border of an increasingly smaller inner rectangle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Understanding**: The plate is divided into a grid of `w` rows and `h` columns. We need to add `k` gilded rings, each forming a border around a smaller inner rectangle.\n2. **Ring Formation**: Each subsequent ring is formed by reducing both the width and height of the rectangle by 4 units (2 units from each side). The perimeter of each ring is calculated based on the current dimensions of the inner rectangle.\n3. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the perimeter is computed as `2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4`, where `current_w` and `current_h` are the dimensions of the current inner rectangle.\n4. **Summing Up**: We sum the perimeters of all `k` rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k`.\n- **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the current width and height of the inner rectangle.\n- **Calculate Perimeter**: For each inner rectangle, compute its perimeter using the formula `2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4`.\n- **Sum Perimeters**: Accumulate the perimeters of all `k` rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n- **Output Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring that all constraints are respected.",
