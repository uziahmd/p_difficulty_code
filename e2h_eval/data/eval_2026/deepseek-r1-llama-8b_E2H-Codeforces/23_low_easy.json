            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles, and I have to find the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form at least one mentsu. A mentsu can be a triplet (three same tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\nHmm, let's break it down. First, I need to process each of the three input strings. Each string represents a tile, like '1s', '2m', etc. So, I'll probably represent each tile as a tuple of (number, suit), which I can convert into integers for easier handling.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Read the input: it's a single line with three space-separated strings.\n2. For each of these three tiles, extract their number and suit.\n3. Then, for each possible way of adding 0, 1, 2, or maybe more tiles, check if any of the possible combinations after adding those tiles can form a mentsu.\n\nWait, but how do I approach checking all possibilities? Since the maximum needed is 4 extra tiles (because with 3 original, plus 4 makes 7, and perhaps that's enough to form a mentsu). But wait, maybe even fewer. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best approach is to generate all possible sets of tiles after adding 0, 1, 2, or up to 4 extra tiles. For each possible number of draws (starting from 0 upwards), check if any of the possible mentsu can be formed with the current tiles plus the drawn ones.\n\nBut considering that the maximum required could be 4, but maybe even less, since for example, with 3 tiles, you might already have a triplet or sequence.\n\nWait, but the output is three separate numbers, each representing the minimum draws needed for each initial set. Wait no, the input is three tiles, but the output is a single line with three numbers. Wait, looking back: the sample input shows three lines, but the actual input is one line with three strings. Oh, no, the sample input in the note shows that each of the three tiles is part of the input. So, for each of the three possible initial hands, compute the minimal number of draws needed.\n\nWait no, the problem says: \"the only line contains three strings\". So, the input is three tiles, and for each tile, we need to compute the minimal number of draws needed for that specific set of three tiles. So, the output is three numbers, each being the minimal draws needed for each of the three input cases.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the output in the sample is three numbers, each corresponding to the three input cases. Or wait, the sample shows that the output is ['0', '0', '1'], which corresponds to the three inputs. So, the input is three tiles, and each of them is processed individually to determine the minimal draws needed. So, the output is three numbers, each for one of the three initial tile sets.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So for each of the three given tile sets, compute the minimal draws needed to form at least one mentsu.\n\nSo, for each of the three initial hands, I need to compute the minimal number of tiles to draw (could be zero) such that the resulting collection has at least one mentsu.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each initial hand (each of the three input strings):\n\n- Generate all possible ways to add 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... tiles (but realistically, up to 4, because beyond that, it's unlikely to find a better solution than earlier draws).\n- For each possible combination, check if any of the possible mentsu can be formed.\n- Find the minimal number of tiles needed for this hand.\n\nSo, for each initial hand, I need to find the smallest k (0 <= k <= 4) such that when adding k tiles (any possible tiles), the hand can form at least one mentsu.\n\nNow, the question is: How to model the problem for each initial hand.\n\nLet's model each initial hand as a multiset of tiles. For each possible k (number of draws), generate all possible multisets after adding any k tiles, and check if any of them contains a mentsu.\n\nBut considering that the possible tiles are infinite, it's impossible to check all possibilities. So, we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to precompute all possible mentsu options, and for each initial hand, see what is the minimal number of tiles needed to complete any of those options.\n\nEach possible mentsu is either a triplet (like 1m,1m,1m) or a sequence (like 1m,2m,3m).\n\nSo, for each possible mentsu, calculate how many tiles from the initial hand are already present",
