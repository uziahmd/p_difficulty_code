    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where Homer and Marge are playing a TV game. The goal is to maximize their total prize by choosing the sequence of moves optimally. Let me try to understand the problem.\n\nThe game starts with a number A that's 2n digits long. Each turn, the player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their own number. After that, that digit is removed from A. They take turns doing this exactly n times each. So in total, there are 2n moves, each adding a digit to either S1 or S2.\n\nThe output should be a string of 'H' and 'M' characters indicating who took each digit. The goal is to maximize the sum of S1 and S2. If multiple sequences give the same maximum, any can be output.\n\nHmm. So, how do we model this? It feels like a dynamic programming problem. Because for each step, the choice of H or M affects the future state, and we need to keep track of what's best at each step.\n\nLet me think about the state representation. Since the order of the digits matters, the state needs to consider which digits have been taken so far and whose turn it is. But wait, the players alternate turns, so maybe the state can be represented by the current index in the string and whose turn it is. Because after each move, the next player will take the next digit.\n\nWait, no. Because each player makes exactly n moves. So the first move is player 1 (Homer), then player 2, and so on, alternating until all 2n digits are processed.\n\nSo, the state can be defined as the current position in the string (i) and whether it's Homer's turn (H) or Marge's turn (M). But since each player must make exactly n moves, we also need to track how many moves each has made so far. Wait, but the number of moves each has made is determined by the number of steps taken: if i is even, it's Homer's (since he starts first) nth move, but wait, no—each step alternates between the two. So step 0 is the initial state, then step 1 is Homer's first move, step 2 is Marge's first, step 3 is Homer's second, etc. So for the ith step (0-based?), the player depends on whether i is even or odd. Or perhaps 0-based or 1-based?\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\n- Initially, A is a string of 2n digits.\n- For each move, the leftmost digit is taken.\n- The players alternate, starting with Homer (H) for the first move.\n- Each player makes exactly n moves.\n\nSo, the first move is H, second is M, third is H, fourth is M, etc., up to 2n moves.\n\nBut in terms of the state, when processing the ith digit (0-based), it's the (i+1)th move. So for i=0, move 1 (H), i=1, move 2 (M), i=2, move 3 (H), and so on.\n\nWait, no. Because each digit is taken one by one. So for i from 0 to 2n-1, each represents the next digit to process. So the first digit is taken by H, the second by M, third by H, fourth by M, etc.\n\nSo, for each position i, the current player is H if i is even (0,2,4,...) and M if i is odd (1,3,5,...).\n\nWait, because i starts at 0. So yes, for each i, the player is H if i is even, else M.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n2\n1234\n\nSample Output:\nHHMM\n\nWhich would mean the first two digits are taken by H, next two by M. Let's see:\n\nDigits: 1,2,3,4.\n\nMove 1: H takes 1 → S1 = '1'\nMove 2: M takes 2 → S2 = '2'\nMove 3: H takes 3 → S1 becomes '12'\nMove 4: M takes 4 → S2 becomes '24'\n\nSo S1 is 12, S2 is 24. Sum is 36.\n\nAlternatively, if the order was HM HM, the sum would be 13 + 24 = 37, which is better. But the sample output is HHMM, which suggests that perhaps the optimal is achieved by taking the highest possible digits as early as possible for both players.\n\nWait, wait. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the sample. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the sample input given is:\n\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\nWait, that might be a typo, because the first line is 2, the second line is 1234, and the second input is 2 and 9911. Oh, perhaps the actual input is n=2, A=1234, and another test case.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample is not very clear. Anyway, back to the problem.\n\nOur task is to choose for each digit whether it's H's or M's move. But each digit can only be assigned once, in order. So the first digit is H's, then M's, and so on.\n\nWait, no! That's not correct. Because each move is a choice between H and M, but the order of the digits in A is fixed. So, the leftmost digit is taken in each step, but the decision is whether it's added to S1 or S2, based on whose turn it is.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the players take turns, but the order of the digits is fixed as the original A. So, the first digit is always taken by H, the second by M, third by H, fourth by M, etc. Is that correct? Or does each player choose which digit to take next?\n\nNo, no. The problem says that before each turn, the players determine who will make the next move. So, the order is determined by the players' choices. Wait, that's confusing.\n\nWait, re-reading the problem statement: Before each turn, players determine who will make the next move. So, for example, after a move by H, it's up to H and M to decide who will make the next move. But each player must make exactly n moves.\n\nWait, that changes everything. So the order isn't fixed as H, M, H, M... It's up to the players to decide the next turn after each move.\n\nOh! That's a completely different situation. So the players can alternate the turns as they wish, provided each makes exactly n moves.\n\nThis complicates things because now, the decision is not just about assigning H or M to each step, but about when to switch turns.\n\nSo for each step, the next player could be the same as the current, or switch. But the total number of H and M moves must each be exactly n.\n\nThis is a key point. So the problem is not about selecting a sequence of H and M of length 2n, but rather about a sequence where exactly n are H and n are M, and the order is chosen such that the sum of S1 and S2 is maximized.\n\nBut wait, the order in which the digits are taken is fixed as the leftmost digit of A. So the first digit is taken in the first move, second in the second, etc. So the order of processing the digits is fixed; the only choice is who takes each digit.\n\nSo the problem reduces to assigning H or M to each of the 2n positions, ensuring that exactly n are H and n are M, and the sum of the digits in the H positions and M positions is maximized.\n\nWait, no. Because S1 is the concatenation of all H digits in the order they were taken, and S2 similarly for M. So the value of S1 is the sum of the digits multiplied by their positional values. Similarly for S2. So, the total prize is the sum of S1 and S2, which is the sum of all digits, but their contribution depends on their position in S1 and S2.\n\nSo, for example, the first digit taken by H is worth 10^{k} * d, where k is the position in S1. Similarly, the first digit taken by M is worth 10^{k} * d for M's S2.\n\nThus, the problem is to assign each digit to H or M, with exactly n digits each, such that the sum of the values of S1 and S2 is maximized.\n\nSo the goal is to arrange the assignments of H and M such that the higher-value digits are placed in positions that contribute more to the sum.\n\nWait, but the positions in S1 and S2 are determined by the order in which the digits are taken. Because the earlier a digit is taken, the higher its place in S1 or S2.\n\nTherefore, the problem can be viewed as follows:\n\nWe have 2n digits, ordered from left to right. Each digit is assigned to either S1 or S2, but exactly n must go to S1 and n to S2. The assignment must be done in such a way that the sum of the numerical values of S1 and S2 is as large as possible.\n\nSo, the question is to choose for each digit whether it goes to S1 or S2, but subject to exactly n digits each, and the order is preserved as per the original A. The goal is to maximize the sum of S1 and S2.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find the optimal assignment.\n\nThis sounds like a dynamic programming problem. Because for each digit, we can choose to assign it to H or M, but with the constraints on the counts.\n\nLet me think about the DP approach.\n\nWe can model the state as (i, h, m), where i is the current digit being considered, h is the number of H assignments used so far, and m is the number of M assignments used so far.\n\nThe value of the state would be the maximum sum achievable from this point onward.\n\nAt each step, for the ith digit, we can choose to assign it to H (if h < n) or to M (if m < n). Then, we add the value of this digit multiplied by 10^{(position in S1 or S2)}.\n\nWait, but the position in S1 or S2 depends on when the digit is assigned. Because the order is fixed as the original A, the earlier digits are added to the beginning of S1 or S2, thus contributing more to their sum.\n\nWait, for example, if the first digit is assigned to S1, it's the first digit of S1. If the second digit is assigned to S2, it's the first digit of S2. The third digit assigned to S1 is the second digit, and so on.\n\nSo, the place value of a digit in S1 depends on how many H digits have been taken before it. Similarly for M.\n\nSo, for each digit, when we assign it to H, its place value is 10^{h}, where h is the number of H digits assigned before this one. Similarly for M.\n\nBut wait, the digits are processed in order, so the first digit (i=0) is assigned to either H or M, then the second (i=1), etc.\n\nWait, but the assignment is not necessarily contiguous. So, for example, H may take the first, third, and fifth digits, while M takes the rest.\n\nIn this case, the first digit is the first in S1, the third is the second in S1, the fifth is the third, etc. Similarly for M.\n\nSo, the place value for a digit assigned to H is 10^{h_count}, where h_count is the number of H digits assigned before this one. Similarly for M.\n\nThus, for each digit, when assigning it to H, the multiplier is 10^current_h_assignments, which is the number of H digits assigned so far plus one.\n\nWait, no. For example, the first H assignment: h_count is 0, so the multiplier is 10^0 = 1, but that's the units place. Wait, no, wait—no, wait: the first digit is the most significant. So for S1, the first digit is multiplied by 10^{(n-1)}, the second by 10^{n-2}, etc., depending on the number of digits.\n\nWait, no. Wait, S1 is built by appending digits to the end. So, the first digit is the most significant. For example, if S1 has digits d1, d2, d3, then S1 is d1*100 + d2*10 + d3*1. So, each digit is multiplied by 10^{(length of S1 - position - 1)}.\n\nSimilarly for S2.\n\nBut the issue is that the assignment of digits to S1 and S2 is not sequential. Because a digit assigned to S1 comes from any position in A, but earlier digits in A are assigned before later ones.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's precompute for each possible assignment of H and M, the sum of S1 and S2, and find the maximum. But 2n can be up to 36, leading to 2^36 possibilities, which is way too big.\n\nThus, dynamic programming seems necessary.\n\nSo, the DP state must capture the following:\n\n- The current index in the digit string (i)\n- The number of H assignments made so far (h)\n- The number of M assignments made so far (m)\n\nThe value stored is the maximum sum achievable starting from this state.\n\nFor each state, we can choose to assign the current digit to H or M, provided h < n or m < n respectively.\n\nWhen assigning to H, the digit's contribution is digit[i] * 10^{h} (since h is the number of H digits before this one, so this will be the (h+1)-th digit in S1, contributing 10^(h) place).\n\nWait, no. Because if the digit is the first H assignment, it's the first digit in S1, so the multiplier is 10^{n-1}, because S1 has n digits. Wait, that's not correct. Because S1 is built as the sum of digits multiplied by 10^{k}, where k is the position in S1 from the left minus one.\n\nWait, for example, if S1 is \"d1 d2 d3\", then d1 is multiplied by 100, d2 by 10, d3 by 1. So for each digit in S1, the multiplier is 10^{(n - pos_in_S1 - 1)}.\n\nBut the problem is that the order in which digits are assigned to S1 determines their position. So, if a digit is assigned to S1 earlier, it gets a higher multiplier.\n\nThus, the earlier a digit is assigned to S1, the higher its contribution.\n\nSimilarly for M.\n\nSo, for each digit, when it is assigned to S1, it's added to S1 as the (h+1)th digit, where h is the current count of H assignments. So, the multiplier is 10^{n - (h + 1)}.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose n = 2.\n\nIf the first digit is assigned to H, then it's the first digit, multiplier is 10^(2-1) = 10.\n\nIf the second digit is assigned to H, it's the second digit, multiplier is 10^(2-2) = 1.\n\nSo, for the i-th digit in the original A, when it's assigned to H, the multiplier is 10^{(n - (h+1))}.\n\nSimilarly for M.\n\nSo, the state needs to know h and m, because that determines the multipliers for the next assignments.\n\nThus, the DP state is (i, h, m), where i is the current position in A, h is the number of H assignments made so far, m is the number of M assignments made so far.\n\nThe transition is:\n\nFrom (i, h, m), we can choose to assign A[i] to H if h < n, resulting in a new state (i+1, h+1, m). The contribution is A[i] * 10^{(n - (h+1))}.\n\nOr, assign A[i] to M if m < n, resulting in (i+1, h, m+1), with contribution A[i] * 10^{(n - (m+1))}.\n\nThe base case is when i == 2n, where the sum is 0.\n\nWe need to compute the maximum sum, and track the path that leads to it.\n\nSo, the DP recurrence is:\n\ndp[i][h][m] = max(\n    (if h < n) dp[i+1][h+1][m] + (digit * 10^{n - (h+1)}),\n    (if m < n) dp[i+1][h][m+1] + (digit * 10^{n - (m+1)})\n)\n\nBut wait, for each digit, the multiplier depends on when it's assigned. So, for the current assignment, the multiplier is determined by how many H or M assignments have been made before this one.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the initial state is (i=0, h=0, m=0), and the goal is to compute dp[2n][n][n].\n\nNow, considering that n can be up to 18, 2n is 36. So, the DP table size is 36 x 19 x 19, which is manageable. Because 36 * 19 * 19 is about 13044, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the power of 10 for all possible exponents needed. Since n can be up to 18, the exponents range from 0 to 17. So, precompute a list pow10 where pow10[k] = 10^k.\n\n2. Implement the DP with memoization. Since Python doesn't handle memoization with mutable parameters well, perhaps using lru_cache with a helper function.\n\nBut wait, Python can handle memoization with tuples as keys. So, we can represent the state as a tuple (i, h, m).\n\n3. For each state, compute the maximum between assigning to H or M.\n\n4. Keep track of the path taken to reach the maximum sum, so that we can reconstruct the sequence of H and M assignments.\n\nWait, but the standard DP approach only computes the maximum sum, not the path. So, to reconstruct the sequence, we need to track not just the maximum sum but also the decisions made along the way.\n\nThis complicates things a bit. One approach is to use a DP table that stores for each state (i, h, m) the maximum sum, and also a parent pointer indicating whether the previous decision was H or M.\n\nBut storing the parent pointers for each state would require additional memory, which may be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, during the DP computation, we can backtrack from the final state to reconstruct the path.\n\nBut in the case of memoization, it's challenging because the function returns the maximum sum without information about the path. So, perhaps, the DP needs to store for each state both the maximum sum and the choice made (H or M) that led to it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can perform the DP in a way that tracks the path as we build the solution.\n\nBut this could complicate the implementation.\n\nAnother approach is to perform the DP and then, once the maximum sum is found, perform a backward search to reconstruct the path.\n\nWait, but that requires knowing which choices (H or M) lead to the maximum sum.\n\nHmm, perhaps the way to do this is to implement the DP with a memoization that, for each state, not only returns the maximum sum but also the choice that led to it. This way, when we reach the final state, we can backtrack through the choices to build the sequence.\n\nBut in Python, memoization with functions can be tricky because the function has to return multiple values.\n\nSo, perhaps, the function will return a tuple (max_sum, choice), where choice is None if it's the end state.\n\nAlternatively, for each state, we can store the choice that leads to the maximum sum.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\nImplement a recursive DP function with memoization.\n\nEach call to dp(i, h, m) returns the maximum sum achievable from this state onwards, along with the choice (H or M) that contributed to this sum.\n\nThe function works as follows:\n\n- If i >= len(A), return (0, None)\n- If (i, h, m) is in memo, return the stored value\n- Compute the maximum between assigning to H and M, if possible.\n- For each possible assignment, compute the next state's result.\n- Choose the option that gives the maximum sum.\n- Store the choice (H or M) in the memo.\n- Return the max sum.\n\nWait, but the choice also affects the next state. So, perhaps the function can return, for each possible choice, the sum.\n\nBut in practice, for each state, the choice is to assign to H or M (if allowed), and the function should select the option that gives the maximum overall sum.\n\nOnce the function has computed the maximum sum, the path can be reconstructed by backtracking through the choices.\n\nBut to implement this, perhaps the function should return a structure that contains the maximum sum and the choice.\n\nWait, let's think about the code structure.\n\nWe can write a function like this:\n\ndef dp(i, h, m):\n    if (i, h, m) in memo:\n        return memo[(i, h, m)]\n    if i == 2*n:\n        return (0, None)\n    max_sum = 0\n    best_choice = None\n    # Try assigning to H if possible\n    if h < n:\n        s_h, choice_h = dp(i+1, h+1, m)\n        current_sum = int(A[i]) * (10 ** (n - (h + 1))) + s_h\n        if current_sum > max_sum:\n            max_sum = current_sum\n            best_choice = 'H'\n    # Try assigning to M if possible\n    if m < n:\n        s_m, choice_m = dp(i+1, h, m+1)\n        current_sum = int(A[i]) * (10 ** (n - (m + 1))) + s_m\n        if current_sum > max_sum:\n            max_sum = current_sum\n            best_choice = 'M'\n    memo[(i, h, m)] = (max_sum, best_choice)\n    return (max_sum, best_choice)\n\nWait, but this approach may not work correctly because when choosing between H and M, the function may pick the choice that gives the higher immediate sum, but perhaps the subsequent choices could lead to a higher overall sum. So, this is a greedy approach and may not work.\n\nFor example, choosing H now might give a higher immediate gain, but leave fewer options for the future, which may result in a lower overall sum than choosing M now.\n\nThus, the function must consider all possible choices and choose the one that leads to the maximum possible sum.\n\nSo, the function needs to explore both options (assign to H or M, if possible) and choose the one that gives the higher total sum.\n\nThus, the function should:\n\n- For each possible choice (H or M, if allowed), compute the sum recursively.\n- Among all possible options, choose the one with the maximum sum.\n\nSo, the function should return the maximum sum obtainable from the current state, regardless of the choice made.\n\nWait, perhaps the function can be written as:\n\ndef dp(i, h, m):\n    if (i, h, m) in memo:\n        return memo[(i, h, m)]\n    if i == 2*n:\n        return (0, None)\n    options = []\n    if h < n:\n        s_h, _ = dp(i+1, h+1, m)\n        val_h = int(A[i]) * (10 ** (n - (h+1))) + s_h\n        options.append( ('H', val_h) )\n    if m < n:\n        s_m, _ = dp(i+1, h, m+1)\n        val_m = int(A[i]) * (10 ** (n - (m+1))) + s_m\n        options.append( ('M', val_m) )\n    if not options:\n        # No possible moves, but since n is at least 1, this shouldn't happen\n        return (0, None)\n    max_val = max(options, key=lambda x: x[1])\n    memo[(i, h, m)] = (max_val[1], max_val[0])\n    return (max_val[1], max_val[0])\n\nThis way, the function tries both options (if possible) and chooses the one that gives the higher sum.\n\nBut wait, in this approach, the function considers all possible options and picks the best, but it doesn't track which choices are made, making it impossible to reconstruct the path.\n\nSo, the function can compute the maximum sum, but we need to track the choices made to build the sequence.\n\nThus, perhaps the function can return the maximum sum and the best choice. But in cases where multiple choices yield the same sum, any can be chosen.\n\nSo, during the DP computation, the function will select the choice (H or M) that leads to the maximum sum.\n\nOnce the DP is computed, the path can be reconstructed by backtracking from (2n, n, n) to (0, 0, 0).\n\nWait, no. Because the function starts at i=0, h=0, m=0, and proceeds to i=1, etc.\n\nSo, to reconstruct the path, we can start from (2n, n, n), and for each step, see whether H or M was chosen in the previous step.\n\nWait, but the function's memoization only keeps track of the maximum sum and the choice for each state. So, perhaps, for each state, we need to store the choice that was made to reach the maximum sum.\n\nThus, the memo will store for each (i, h, m) not only the sum but also the choice (H or M) that was made to get there.\n\nSo, the memo can be a dictionary where each key is (i, h, m), and the value is a tuple (sum, choice).\n\nSo, modifying the function:\n\nmemo = {}\ndef dp(i, h, m):\n    key = (i, h, m)\n    if key in memo:\n        return memo[key]\n    if i == 2*n:\n        return (0, None)\n    options = []\n    if h < n:\n        s_h, choice_h = dp(i+1, h+1, m)\n        val_h = int(A[i]) * (10 ** (n - (h+1))) + s_h\n        options.append( (val_h, 'H') )\n    if m < n:\n        s_m, choice_m = dp(i+1, h, m+1)\n        val_m = int(A[i]) * (10 ** (n - (m+1))) + s_m\n        options.append( (val_m, 'M') )\n    if not options:\n        # Impossible, but n >=1, so this won't happen\n        return (0, None)\n    # Find the option with maximum value\n    max_val = max(options, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    # If multiple options have the same max_val, pick the first one (or any)\n    memo[key] = (max_val[0], max_val[1])\n    return (max_val[0], max_val[1])\n\nWait, but in this case, the function returns the sum and the choice for the current state. So, for the initial state (0,0,0), the function returns the sum and the choice, which is the first choice made.\n\nBut for the DP, the function needs to choose between the two options (H and M) based on which one gives the higher total sum. Thus, the function correctly selects the best choice.\n\nOnce the function completes, we can get the sum and the initial choice. Then, to reconstruct the sequence, we need to backtrack from (2n, n, n) to (0, 0, 0), recording each choice.\n\nWait, no. The initial call is to (0,0,0), which returns the maximum sum and the first choice. But to reconstruct the entire sequence, we need to track all the choices made during the recursion.\n\nSo, perhaps, during the DP, for each state, we can store not only the maximum sum but also the choice made to reach it.\n\nOnce the maximum sum is found, we can then reconstruct the path by stepping back through the states, noting each choice.\n\nAn alternative approach is to have a separate data structure that keeps track of the path.\n\nBut this can become complex.\n\nSo, perhaps, the function can be modified to return the sequence of choices, but that's not feasible for memoization purposes.\n\nAlternatively, once the maximum sum is found, we can perform a BFS or DFS from (2n, n, n) to (0, 0, 0), tracking the choices made in reverse.\n\nWait, but that would require a lot of computation, as we'd have to explore all possible paths backward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function can be modified to not only compute the maximum sum but also keep track of the choices made to reach it.\n\nBut that's difficult with the current setup.\n\nWait, perhaps, during the DP computation, for each state, we can store the choice that was made to achieve the maximum sum. Then, once the initial state is computed, we can backtrack from (2n, n, n) to (0, 0, 0), collecting the choices in reverse order.\n\nWait, but the memoization only stores the sum and the choice for each state. So, for example, when we reach (2n, n, n), it's the end state, and we don't have a choice. Then, for (2n-1, n-1, n), the choice is either H or M, depending on which option was chosen to reach the maximum sum.\n\nBut reconstructing the path requires knowing, for each step, whether the digit was assigned to H or M.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the maximum sum using the DP function.\n2. Reconstruct the sequence of choices by backtracking from (2n, n, n) to (0, 0, 0).\n\nTo reconstruct the path:\n\nStart at (2n, n, n). Since this is the end, there's no choice. Move to (2n-1, n, n), and see which choice (H or M) was made to reach this state. The choice is stored in the memo for (2n-1, n, n).\n\nThen, for each previous state, we record the choice, and proceed to the next state.\n\nBut wait, the memo for (i, h, m) contains the choice that was made to reach (i, h, m). So, for (i, h, m), the choice was made when assigning the i-th digit.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because the function assigns the i-th digit to H or M, and then proceeds to i+1, h+1 or m+1.\n\nSo, for the state (i, h, m), the choice is whether the i-th digit was assigned to H or M.\n\nThus, to reconstruct the sequence, we can start from (2n, n, n), which is the state after all digits are processed. Then, for each state, we move to the previous state (i-1, h-1, m) if the choice was H, or (i-1, h, m-1) if the choice was M.\n\nWait, no. Because for each state (i, h, m), the choice corresponds to the i-th digit.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- To reach (i, h, m), the i-th digit was assigned to H if h = h_prev +1, or M if m = m_prev +1.\n\nThus, to backtrack, for a state (i, h, m), the previous state is:\n\nIf the choice was H, then the previous state is (i-1, h-1, m). The digit was assigned to H, so the i-th digit was the (h)th H assignment.\n\nIf the choice was M, then the previous state is (i-1, h, m-1).\n\nThus, to reconstruct the path, we can start from (2n, n, n) and work backwards.\n\nBut wait, the state (2n, n, n) is the end state, and the previous state is (2n-1, n-1, n) or (2n-1, n, n-1), depending on whether the last digit was H or M.\n\nBut how do we know which choice was made? Because the memo for (2n-1, ...) would contain the choice that led to (2n, ...).\n\nWait, no. Because the memo for (i, h, m) contains the choice that was made to assign the i-th digit.\n\nSo, for state (2n-1, h, m), the choice is whether the (2n-1)-th digit was assigned to H or M.\n\nThus, the process is:\n\nInitialize the result list.\n\nSet current state to (2n, n, n).\n\nWhile current state is not (0, 0, 0):\n\n   Get the choice from the memo for the current state.\n\n   Add the choice to the result list.\n\n   Determine the previous state:\n\n      if choice is 'H': previous state is (i-1, h-1, m)\n\n      if choice is 'M': previous state is (i-1, h, m-1)\n\n   Set current state to previous state.\n\nBut wait, the memo for (i, h, m) gives the choice made to reach (i, h, m). So, for example, for state (i, h, m), the choice was to assign digit i to H or M.\n\nSo, to reconstruct the sequence, the first choice is for digit 0, then digit 1, etc.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\nresult = []\n\ncurrent_state = (2n, n, n)\n\nwhile current_state != (0, 0, 0):\n\n   i, h, m = current_state\n\n   # Get the choice for this state\n\n   # But wait, the memo for (i, h, m) is the choice made to assign the i-th digit.\n\n   # So, if the current state is (i, h, m), the choice is the choice that was made for the i-th digit.\n\n   # So, for example, if the choice is 'H', then the i-th digit was assigned to H.\n\n   # So, the previous state is (i-1, h-1, m).\n\n   # But wait, for i=2n, the previous state is (2n-1, ...), but in that case, the choice for (2n, n, n) is irrelevant.\n\n   # So, perhaps, the loop starts from i=2n and moves back to i=0.\n\n   # Wait, perhaps the initial state is (0, 0, 0), and the function returns the choice for i=0.\n\n   Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nEach time the function processes i-th digit, it makes a choice (H or M), and then proceeds to i+1.\n\nSo, the choice for i=0 is recorded in the memo for (0, 0, 0), which tells us whether the first digit was H or M.\n\nThen, for i=1, the choice is stored in (1, h, m), etc.\n\nThus, to reconstruct the sequence, we can start from i=0, and for each step, note the choice, then proceed to i=1, etc.\n\nBut how to do this using the memoization.\n\nWait, perhaps, the function can be modified to not only compute the maximum sum but also track the choices made in a separate data structure, like a parent pointer.\n\nBut with 36 * 19 * 19 possible states, this may be manageable.\n\nSo, perhaps, during the DP, for each state, we can store the choice that was made to reach it.\n\nThus, the memo can be a dictionary where each key is (i, h, m), and the value is a tuple (sum, choice).\n\nSo, the function would look like this:\n\nmemo = {}\n\ndef dp(i, h, m):\n    key = (i, h, m)\n    if key in memo:\n        return memo[key]\n    if i == 2*n:\n        return (0, None)\n    options = []\n    if h < n:\n        s_h, choice_h = dp(i+1, h+1, m)\n        val_h = int(A[i]) * (10 ** (n - (h + 1))) + s_h\n        options.append( ('H', val_h) )\n    if m < n:\n        s_m, choice_m = dp(i+1, h, m+1)\n        val_m = int(A[i]) * (10 ** (n - (m + 1))) + s_m\n        options.append( ('M', val_m) )\n    if not options:\n        return (0, None)\n    max_val = max(options, key=lambda x: x[1])\n    memo[key] = (max_val[1], max_val[0])\n    return (max_val[1], max_val[0])\n\nWait, no. Because the function returns the sum and the choice, but the choice is the one that was made to reach the current state.\n\nWait, perhaps the function can be written to return the choice made at the current state, and the sum is the sum after that choice.\n\nThus, for the current state (i, h, m), the function returns the choice (H or M) that was made, and the sum that results from that choice.\n\nBut in that case, the function can't choose the best option because it would have to consider all possible choices.\n\nWait, perhaps the function should return the maximum sum achievable from this state, along with the best choice.\n\nBut then, during the DP, for each state, the function would have to consider all possible choices and choose the one that gives",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the sequence of moves for Homer and Marge in a TV game such that their total prize is maximized. The game involves two players taking turns to append the leftmost digit of a given number to their respective numbers, with each player making exactly `n` moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming (DP). The key idea is to use memoization to store the maximum possible sum starting from each state defined by the current position in the digit string, and the number of digits each player has taken so far.\n\n1. **State Representation**: The DP state is represented by a tuple `(i, h, m)`, where:\n   - `i` is the current position in the digit string.\n   - `h` is the number of digits taken by Homer so far.\n   - `m` is the number of digits taken by Marge so far.\n\n2. **Transition**: For each state `(i, h, m)`, we have two possible transitions:\n   - Assign the current digit to Homer if he hasn't taken `n` digits yet.\n   - Assign the current digit to Marge if she hasn't taken `n` digits yet.\n\n3. **Memoization**: We use a dictionary to store the maximum sum achievable from each state and the choice (H or M) that leads to this sum.\n\n4. **Reconstruction**: After computing the maximum sum using DP, we backtrack from the final state to reconstruct the sequence of moves that led to this maximum sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    pow10 = [10**i for i in range(n+1)]\n    \n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(i, h, m):\n        if i == 2 * n:\n            return (0, None)\n        \n        options = []\n        if h < n:\n            next_h, next_choice = dp(i + 1, h + 1, m)\n            val = int(A[i]) * pow10[n - (h + 1)] + next_h\n            options.append(('H', val))\n        if m < n:\n            next_m, next_choice = dp(i + 1, h, m + 1)\n            val = int(A[i]) * pow10[n - (m + 1)] + next_m\n            options.append(('M', val))\n        \n        if not options:\n            return (0, None)\n        \n        max_val = max(options, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        choice = max_val[1]\n        return (max_val[0], choice)\n    \n    max_sum, initial_choice = dp(0, 0, 0)\n    \n    result = []\n    current_i, current_h, current_m = 0, 0, 0\n    while True:\n        if current_i == 2 * n:\n            break\n        sum_val, choice = dp(current_i, current_h, current_m)\n        result.append(choice)\n        if choice == 'H':\n            current_h += 1\n        else:\n            current_m += 1\n        current_i += 1\n    \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Read the input values and precompute the powers of 10 needed for calculating the place values of the digits.\n\n2. **DP Function**: The `dp` function uses memoization to store the maximum sum achievable from each state `(i, h, m)`. It considers both possible moves (assigning the current digit to Homer or Marge) and chooses the one that maximizes the total sum.\n\n3. **Memoization**: The results of the DP function are stored in a dictionary to avoid recomputation and improve efficiency.\n\n4. **Path Reconstruction**: After determining the maximum sum, the path is reconstructed by backtracking from the final state to the initial state, collecting the choices made at each step.\n\nThis approach ensures that we explore all possible sequences of moves efficiently and find the one that maximizes the total prize for both players.",
