He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine for each of the 2n-2 given strings whether it's a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. The output is a string where each character is either 'P' or 'S' based on that classification.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. The main idea is that for each possible string length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings: one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. But wait, no—wait, Ivan has provided all the improper prefixes and suffixes, but we don't know which are which. So our job is to figure out for each of these strings whether it's a prefix or a suffix.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each of the 2n-2 strings is either a prefix or a suffix, but not necessarily unique. So for each position in the output string, it's either 'P' or 'S' depending on whether the corresponding input string is a prefix or suffix of the original s.\n\nSo how can I model this? Let's see. The key is to find the correct s such that all the P and S assignments are consistent with s being the string.\n\nBut since s is unknown, perhaps we can reconstruct s step by step.\n\nLet me think: the first step is to group the input strings by their lengths. For each length l (from 1 to n-1), there are two strings. One of them must be a prefix, and the other must be a suffix.\n\nWait, no. Because for a string of length l, if it's a prefix, then the next part must match accordingly. Similarly for suffixes.\n\nWait, but for example, suppose for l=2, the two strings are 'ab' and 'ba'. If s starts with 'ab', then 'ba' could be a suffix if s ends with 'ba'. But that depends on s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to try to build the string s by combining prefixes and suffixes.\n\nAnother thought: the overall string s must be such that for each possible prefix and suffix, the overlapping parts must agree. For example, if a certain string is a prefix, then any longer string starting with it as a prefix would also be considered.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to proceed is as follows:\n\n1. Find the possible candidates for s.\n\nBut with n up to 100, trying all possibilities isn't feasible because there are 26^100 possible strings, which is impossible.\n\nSo another approach is needed.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nWe can model the problem by considering that for each length l, the two strings must satisfy that one is a prefix of s and the other is a suffix of s.\n\nSo for each l, the two strings at that length must satisfy that one is a proper prefix of the other when concatenated, but perhaps that's not directly applicable.\n\nWait, no. Let's think differently.\n\nSuppose that for each l, the two strings are p and q. Then, one of them is a prefix, say p is a prefix, and the other is a suffix. But how do they relate?\n\nWell, the prefix of length l is p, and the suffix of length l is q. So, when you combine them, you get a string of length l + (n - l) = n, but that's not necessarily directly helpful.\n\nWait, but the entire string s must have s[0..l-1] = p and s[n-l..n-1] = q. So for the two strings p and q at length l, they must be compatible in some way.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, the two strings at that length must be such that p is a prefix of s, and q is a suffix of s. So the entire string s must start with p and end with q.\n\nMoreover, for l' < l, the same applies.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to construct s step by step, using the information from the given strings.\n\nLet's consider that for each l, the two strings are a prefix candidate and a suffix candidate.\n\nFor l=1, the two strings are, say, 'a' and 'b'. So s must start with either 'a' or 'b' as its first character, and end with either 'a' or 'b' as its last character.\n\nBut for higher l, we have more constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the minimal possible s, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: for each possible pair of prefix and suffix at each l, the entire s must be formed by combining the prefix and suffix, ensuring that the overlapping parts match.\n\nWait, for example, if at l=2, the prefix is 'ab' and the suffix is 'ba', then s would have to be 'ab...ba', but the middle part needs to be consistent.\n\nWait, but perhaps the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine for each of the given strings whether it is a prefix or a suffix of the original string `s` of length `n`. The output will be a string where each character is either 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix).\n\n### Approach\nThe key idea is to construct the string `s` step by step using the given prefixes and suffixes. For each length from 1 to `n-1`, there are exactly two strings: one must be a prefix and the other a suffix. We can build `s` by ensuring that the overlapping parts of these strings agree.\n\n1. **Group Strings by Length**: Group the input strings by their lengths. For each length `l`, there are two strings which must be a prefix and a suffix.\n2. **Construct the String**: Start by determining the first character of `s` from the shortest strings. Then, iteratively extend `s` by checking the compatibility of the next possible characters from both the prefix and suffix candidates.\n3. **Check Compatibility**: Ensure that each new character added to `s` from both the prefix and suffix candidates matches, thus building `s` correctly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nstrings = []\nfor _ in range(2 * n - 2):\n    s = input().strip()\n    strings.append(s)\n\n# Group by length\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nlength_map = defaultdict(list)\nfor s in strings:\n    length_map[len(s)].append(s)\n\n# Find the minimal possible s\ns = [''] * n\n\n# Determine first character\nif len(length_map[1]) == 2:\n    # Only two options, but for n >=2, at least one must be the first char\n    pass  # handled in the loop below\n\ncurrent_s = []\nfor l in sorted(length_map.keys()):\n    candidates = length_map[l]\n    if l == 1:\n        # The first character can be either of the two\n        # Choose one arbitrarily; it might not matter, but let's pick the first\n        s_char = candidates[0][0]\n        current_s.append(s_char)\n    else:\n        # We have already built up to l-1\n        # Now, try to add the next character\n        # The next character should match both the prefix and suffix\n        # Take the last character of the current s as the starting point\n        last_char = current_s[-1]\n        possible_prefix = candidates[0][1:l] + last_char\n        possible_suffix = candidates[1][0:l] + last_char\n        # Check if possible_prefix and possible_suffix can form the next part\n        # Or, alternatively, find a common extension\n        # This part is more complex, perhaps we need to find a way to merge them\n        # For simplicity, let's assume that one of the candidates is the correct prefix and the other is the suffix\n        # So, check if the prefix starts with the current s, and the suffix ends with it\n        # But how?\n        # Alternatively, try to see if the prefix can be extended from the current s\n        # Or the suffix can be\n        # This is getting complicated, maybe another approach is needed\n        # Since time is limited, perhaps we can proceed with the initial approach, assuming that the first candidate is the prefix and the second is the suffix\n        # So, try to build s by taking the prefix and then the suffix\n        # If they don't match, swap them\n        prefix_candidate = candidates[0]\n        suffix_candidate = candidates[1]\n        if len(prefix_candidate) < l:\n            prefix_candidate += last_char\n        if len(suffix_candidate) < l:\n            suffix_candidate += last_char\n        if prefix_candidate == current_s + last_char[:l]:\n            current_s.append(last_char)\n        else:\n            # Try swapping\n            current_s.append(last_char)\n\n# Wait, this approach might not work.

Let's model the possible transitions between the possible prefixes and suffixes.\n\n# Maybe we can represent the state as the current possible prefix and suffix up to a certain length.\n\n# But this might get too complex.

The way I'm building current_s may not always work because sometimes the prefix and suffix may not directly align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to consider that the correct s is determined by the minimal possible prefix and suffix. Once s is determined, we can then assign P or S to each string based on whether it matches the corresponding prefix or suffix.\n\nBut how to determine s?\n\nAnother approach is to realize that s must be such that for each l, the two strings at that length l must be a prefix and a suffix. Thus, for each l, one of the strings must be a prefix, and the other a suffix.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to consider that for each l, the two strings must be such that one is a prefix and the other is a suffix of s. So, for each l, the two strings must be such that when you concatenate them, they form a longer string that is consistent with s.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best way is to refer to the solution approach described in the problem's note. Specifically, the problem can be approached by reconstructing the string s by considering that for each length l, the two strings must fit together such that the prefix is a prefix of s and the suffix is a suffix of s.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n1. Group the input strings by their lengths.\n2. For each length l, determine the correct order of the two strings (which is the prefix and which is the suffix) by checking if they can form a valid extension of the current s.\n3. Once s is constructed, assign 'P' or 'S' to each string based on whether it matches the corresponding prefix or suffix.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nstrings = []\nfor _ in range(2 * n - 2):\n    s = input().strip()\n    strings.append(s)\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nlength_map = defaultdict(list)\nfor s in strings:\n    length_map[len(s)].append(s)\n\ncurrent_s = []\nfor l in sorted(length_map.keys()):\n    candidates = length_map[l]\n    found = False\n    for prefix_candidate, suffix_candidate in [(candidates[0], candidates[1]), (candidates[1], candidates[0])]:\n        if len(current_s) > 0:\n            if prefix_candidate != current_s[:len(prefix_candidate)]:\n                continue\n            if suffix_candidate != current_s[-len(suffix_candidate):] if len(current_s) >= len(suffix_candidate) else None:\n                continue\n        current_s += list(prefix_candidate)\n        found = True\n        break\n    if not found:\n        current_s += list(candidates[0])\n        current_s += list(candidates[1][- (len(current_s) - l):])\n\n# Now, build the output\noutput = []\nfor s_str in strings:\n    l = len(s_str)\n    if current_s[:l] == s_str:\n        output.append('P')\n    elif current_s[-l:] == s_str:\n        output.append('S')\n    else:\n        # This shouldn't happen according to the problem statement\n        output.append('P')\n\nprint(''.join(output))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Grouping by Length**: The input strings are grouped by their lengths into a dictionary where each key is a length and the value is a list of strings of that length.\n2. **Constructing the String**: The string `s` is built incrementally.
