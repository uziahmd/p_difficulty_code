String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to count the number of beautiful strings based on certain criteria. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe string is considered beautiful if it meets these conditions:\n1. It consists only of 0s and 1s.\n2. The number of 0s is exactly n and the number of 1s is exactly m.\n3. We can obtain the character g from the string with some modifications. Modifications involve replacing two last characters with one, which depends on what they are. For example, two 0s become a 0, two 1s become a 0? Wait, no, wait: the operation replaces two last characters with one other character. So if the two are 0s, replace them with a 0. If both are 1s, replace with a 1. Wait, the problem says: \"replace two last characters by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\" Hmm, wait, that's not right. Wait, the description says: \"if it replaces two zeros, then it becomes one.\" Or wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me read again.\n\nWait, the modification is: when you replace two last characters, if they are both 0s, the replacement is a 0 (so no change?), or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Oh, no: the way it's written is, \"the character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\" So when you have two 0s, you replace them with a 1. Because the condition is: if the two being replaced are zeros, replace with one. Otherwise, replace with zero.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me parse the sentence again. The operation replaces two last characters with one other character. That other character is 1 if it's replacing two zeros; else, it's 0. So for example, if the last two are 0 and 0, they become 1. If they're 0 and 1, they become 0. If they're 1 and 1, they become 0. Wait, no: the condition is, if the two are zeros, replace with one. Else, replace with zero.\n\nSo the modified character is 1 only if both were 0s. Otherwise, it's 0.\n\nHmm, but in the example given:\n\nIn the first sample input, the output is \"01\" and \"10\". Let's see why.\n\nWait, the first example's input is n=1, m=1, g=0. So the beautiful strings must have exactly one 0 and one 1. But also, after some modifications, the final string should be such that the last character is g, which is 0. So how does this work?\n\nWait, let's think about the process of modifying the string. Each modification reduces the length by 1. So starting from a string of length k, each modification reduces it by 1. So the initial string must have a length that allows for enough modifications to reach a certain condition.\n\nWait, but the problem says that we can perform any number of modifications, including zero. So for a string s, after some steps, we get another string s'. The character at the end of s' must be g. Also, the resulting string must have the same count of 0s and 1s as the original s, because each modification doesn't change the counts except for the two being replaced.\n\nWait, wait, no: each modification replaces two characters with one. So the total count of 0s and 1s changes.\n\nWait, for example, if the last two are 0s, then replacing them with 1: the count of 0s decreases by 2 (because two 0s are removed) and the count of 1s increases by 1. So the total count of 0s and 1s changes. Similarly, if the last two are 1s, replacing them with 0 would decrease the 1s count by 2 and increase 0s by 1.\n\nBut wait, the problem requires that the original string has exactly n 0s and m 1s. So after modifications, the resulting string must also satisfy the same counts? Or is that not the case?\n\nWait, no. Because the modifications alter the counts. So the beautiful string s must be such that, after some modifications, the resulting string ends with g, but the counts of 0s and 1s in the beautiful string s may differ from n and m. Hmm, no, that can't be right because the problem says that s is beautiful if it meets the criteria, which includes having exactly n 0s and m 1s. So the counts must remain n and m throughout all modifications, but that's not possible because each modification changes the counts.\n\nWait, that's a contradiction. So I must have misunderstood something.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement says: String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:\n- Only 0s and 1s.\n- Exactly n 0s and m 1s.\n- We can obtain character g from s with some modifications.\n\nWait, but each modification changes the counts of 0s and 1s. So how can the beautiful string s have n 0s and m 1s, yet after modifications, the resulting string (which is different) can have a different count? Or perhaps the beautiful string s is the result after some modifications, but before any further modifications.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify.\n\nThe string s is the beautiful string. After some modifications, the string s can be transformed into another string s', such that the last character of s' is g. So the original beautiful string s can be modified any number of times, but during each modification, the string's length decreases by 1 each time.\n\nBut the key is that s is the beautiful string, which must have exactly n 0s and m 1s. So during the modifications, the counts of 0s and 1s change.\n\nWait, but that can't be, because the problem says that the beautiful string must have exactly n and m. So perhaps the modifications are applied to the string s to produce a string that has a certain last character, but the beautiful string s itself must meet the criteria, regardless of the modifications.\n\nWait, perhaps the beautiful string is s, and it's required that s can be modified in such a way that the resulting string ends with g. So the counts of 0s and 1s in s can be anything, but when modified, the final string ends with g.\n\nWait, no, that can't be, because the problem says the beautiful string must have exactly n 0s and m 1s. So the counts are fixed. So how can s be modified into a string that ends with g, given that each modification changes the counts?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should look at the examples.\n\nFirst example: input is 1 1 0. Output is 2, which are \"01\" and \"10\". So both these strings have exactly one 0 and one 1. Now, can each be modified to end with 0?\n\nLet's see: For \"01\", its last two characters are \"0\" and \"1\". When we perform a modification, since they are different, we replace them with 0. So the modified string is \"0\", which ends with 0. So yes, it can be modified to end with 0.\n\nSimilarly, for \"10\": the last two are \"1\" and \"0\". Replace with 0. So the modified string is \"0\", ends with 0.\n\nHence, both are beautiful.\n\nSecond example: input 2 2 0. Output is 4. The beautiful strings are \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".\n\nEach of these has exactly 2 0s and 2 1s. Now, can they be modified to end with 0?\n\nFor example, \"0011\": let's see. Let's perform two modifications.\n\nFirst, take the last two '1's. They are both 1s. Replacing them with 0. So the string becomes \"00\" + 0 → \"000\". Now, the last character is 0. So yes.\n\nAlternatively, another path: first, modify the last two '1's to 0, getting \"000\", which ends with 0.\n\nAnother option: \"0011\" could have the last two 1s replaced, leading to a single 0, making the string \"000\", which ends with 0.\n\nWait, but each modification reduces the length by 1. So for \"0011\" (length 4), each modification reduces by 1. To get to a single character, you need three modifications.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the modifications are optional. So the string can be modified any number of times, including zero. So for the string to end with g, it's sufficient that after some number of modifications (possibly zero), the last character is g.\n\nBut wait, the resulting string after modifications must end with g. So for example, if the original string is of even length, and each modification reduces it by 1, the resulting string could be of odd or even length, depending on the number of modifications.\n\nBut in the case of the beautiful string s, it must have exactly n 0s and m 1s. So the question is whether, for a given s, there exists a sequence of modifications that leads to a string ending with g.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the possible transformations and see whether the original string can be reduced to a string ending with g, regardless of its length.\n\nBut that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find all possible beautiful strings s that can be reduced to a string that ends with g, regardless of their own length.\n\nWait, but the beautiful string s itself has a certain length. Each modification reduces the length by 1, but the problem doesn't specify how many modifications are done. So for s to be beautiful, it's sufficient that there exists at least one way to perform modifications (possibly zero) such that the resulting string ends with g.\n\nSo, for example, if the original string ends with g, then it's automatically beautiful because we can choose to do zero modifications.\n\nIf the original string ends with a different character than g, but can be modified once to end with g, then it's also beautiful.\n\nSo the task is to find all beautiful strings s (with exactly n 0s and m 1s) such that s can be reduced to a string that ends with g via some number of modifications.\n\nNow, the challenge is to model this.\n\nLet me think about the possible ways the string can end with g after some modifications.\n\nEach modification reduces the length by 1. So the string's length is initially l, and after k modifications, it's l -k.\n\nWe need to find for which k, after k modifications, the string ends with g.\n\nBut since the order of modifications matters, it's tricky.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the problem can be modeled as a dynamic programming problem where we track the state of the string as we perform modifications, keeping track of the current last character and the counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nBut considering the constraints (n and m up to 105), that might be manageable.\n\nWait, but the counts change with each modification. Each modification affects the counts.\n\nWait, but the beautiful string s must have exactly n 0s and m 1s. So the modifications can't change those counts. Wait, that's impossible because each modification reduces the total length by 1, but also changes the counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So perhaps the beautiful string s is such that after some modifications, the resulting string has exactly g as the last character, but the counts of 0s and 1s in the beautiful string may not match n and m.\n\nNo, the problem statement says that the beautiful string s must have exactly n 0s and m 1s. So any modifications to s must result in a string that doesn't have exactly n and m counts anymore. So perhaps the only way for s to be beautiful is that it can be modified in such a way that the final string ends with g, regardless of the counts.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the problem statement says that s is beautiful if it meets the criteria, which include the counts.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\nString s is beautiful if:\n\n- s consists only of 0s and 1s.\n\n- s has exactly n 0s and m 1s.\n\n- We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly zero) modifications.\n\nAh! So the string s is the one that is beautiful. The string s itself must be such that, after some modifications, the resulting string ends with g. But the beautiful string s must have exactly n 0s and m 1s.\n\nWait, but each modification changes the counts. So for s to be beautiful, after some modifications, the string ends with g, but the counts of 0s and 1s in s can change through modifications. So the beautiful string s can have any counts, but the problem says s must have exactly n 0s and m 1s. So this seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the beautiful string s must satisfy that after any number of modifications (including zero), the resulting string ends with g. But that's not the case because the problem says that the string can be modified some times, but not necessarily all possible.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the string s is beautiful if we can obtain g from s with some (possibly zero) modifications. So it's sufficient that there exists at least one way to modify s (some number of times) to reach a string that ends with g.\n\nSo the beautiful string s must have exactly n 0s and m 1s, but after some modifications, it must end with g.\n\nBut each modification changes the counts of 0s and 1s. So for the string s, the counts are n and m, but after k modifications, the counts are different.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the beautiful string must have exactly n 0s and m 1s. So how can the modified string end with g, given that the counts have changed.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try to model the problem differently.\n\nPerhaps the key is to model the possible transitions of the string as we perform modifications, tracking the last character, the number of 0s and 1s, and the length.\n\nBut considering the constraints (n and m up to 105), perhaps a DP approach is feasible.\n\nLet me consider that each modification step affects the last two characters, and thus the new last character is determined.\n\nWait, but the modification replaces the last two characters with one. So for a string s, the next state depends on the last two characters.\n\nBut for a string of length l, each modification reduces the length by 1, so the process can be thought of as building the string from the end towards the beginning.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the problem by working backwards. Starting from the desired last character g, and seeing what possible previous states could lead to it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the process as a state machine where each state consists of:\n\n- The current last character (could be 0 or 1).\n- The number of 0s remaining (but this might not be necessary).\n- The number of 1s remaining (same issue).\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the crucial point is to determine whether a string can be modified to end with g, regardless of the initial counts, but the beautiful string must have exactly n 0s and m 1s. So the problem is to count all strings with n 0s and m 1s that can be reduced to a string ending with g.\n\nBut since each modification changes the counts, the beautiful string s must be such that after some modifications, the string ends with g. However, the counts of 0s and 1s in s must be exactly n and m, but after modifications, they change. So the modified string's counts are different.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that the beautiful string s is the one that must have exactly n 0s and m 1s. So the counts are fixed for s. So the modified string cannot have the same counts, but the problem doesn't require that.\n\nSo the problem is: count all possible s with exactly n 0s and m 1s, such that s can be modified any number of times (possibly zero) to end with g.\n\nSo the focus is on whether, for a given s, it's possible to perform some modifications to reach a string ending with g.\n\nBut how?\n\nEach modification step reduces the length of the string by 1, so the minimal length after any number of modifications is 1 (since you can't modify a string of length less than 2). So for the string to be reducible to a string ending with g, it must be possible to perform enough modifications to reach a string of length 1, whose character is g. Or, alternatively, stop earlier.\n\nBut the string can be modified in various ways, and the path taken will affect the outcome.\n\nWait, but the problem allows any number of modifications, including zero. So for a string s, if it already ends with g, it's beautiful. Otherwise, if it's possible to modify it once, twice, etc., until the end is g.\n\nBut this seems too broad. How do we model this?\n\nAn alternative approach: for a given s, can it be reduced to a string ending with g through any number of modifications?\n\nTo model this, perhaps we can consider the possible transitions when performing a modification.\n\nEach modification takes the last two characters and replaces them with a new character based on their values.\n\nSo, for a given state represented by the last character (say, c) and the counts of 0s and 1s (n0, n1), and the length l, can we transition to a new state after a modification?\n\nWait, but the counts change when a modification is performed.\n\nEach modification reduces the length by 1, so the new length is l-1.\n\nThe new last character is determined by the last two characters:\n\n- If the last two were 0 and 0, replace with 1.\n- If the last two were 1 and 1, replace with 0.\n- If the last two were 0 and 1 (or 1 and 0), replace with 0.\n\nWait, according to the problem statement: the replacement is 1 only if the two were 0s. Otherwise, it's 0.\n\nSo for the last two characters a and b:\n\n- If a == b == 0: replace with 1.\n- Else: replace with 0.\n\nSo the new last character is 1 if the two are 0s, else 0.\n\nNow, the counts change as follows:\n\nSuppose before modification, the counts are n0 and n1.\n\nAfter replacing two 0s with 1: n0 decreases by 2, n1 increases by 1.\n\nIf the two were 1s: n1 decreases by 2, n0 increases by 1.\n\nIf the two were 0 and 1 (regardless of order): n0 decreases by 1, n1 decreases by 1, and the new character is 0. So n0 remains the same minus 1 (since two are replaced by 0, which is one 0 added). So n0 = n0 -1 (since two 0s and one 1 are replaced by one 0: net change is -1 for 0s and -1 for 1s, plus adding one 0. So overall, n0 -= 1, n1 -= 1.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nWhen the last two are 0 and 0: replaced by 1. So n0 decreases by 2, n1 increases by 1.\n\nWhen the last two are 1 and 1: replaced by 0. So n1 decreases by 2, n0 increases by 1.\n\nWhen the last two are 0 and 1 (in any order): replaced by 0. So n0 decreases by 1 (since two 0s and one 1 are replaced by one 0: the two are replaced, so for 0s: two are subtracted, but one is added. So n0 = n0 - 2 + 1 = n0 -1. Similarly, for 1s: two are subtracted, but none are added, so n1 = n1 - 2.\n\nWait, no: the two are being replaced by one 0. So n0 is decreased by two (two 0s are removed) and increased by one (one 0 is added). So n0 = n0 - 2 + 1 = n0 -1. Similarly, n1 is decreased by two (two 1s are removed), no addition. So n1 = n1 - 2.\n\nWait, but that's only when the last two are 0 and 1. So in all cases, the counts change accordingly.\n\nSo, the state can be represented by:\n\n- The current length l (initially len(s) = n + m)\n- The current last character c (0 or 1)\n- The current counts of 0s (n0) and 1s (n1)\n\nBut wait, the initial string s has n0 = n, n1 = m. But after each modification, these counts change as per the rules above.\n\nBut the problem is to find all possible s that can be modified any number of times to end with g. So for each s, we can model the possible paths of modifications and see if any of them results in the last character being g.\n\nBut considering that n and m are up to 105, and each modification can change the counts, the state space can be quite large.\n\nSo perhaps a memoization approach is needed.\n\nBut the initial string s is variable, and we need to count all such s with exactly n0 = n and n1 = m.\n\nWait, but n0 and n1 are fixed as n and m for the beautiful string s. So the beautiful string s has exactly n 0s and m 1s. So the counts for s are fixed, but after modifications, the counts change.\n\nThus, the problem is to find the number of strings s with exactly n 0s and m 1s, such that there exists a sequence of modifications that results in a string ending with g.\n\nSo for each s, the counts are fixed as n and m, but after each modification, the counts change. So the state of the string during modifications can vary, but the initial s must have exactly n and m.\n\nThis suggests that the DP needs to track the current counts of 0s and 1s, along with the last character and the current length.\n\nBut with n and m up to 105, and length up to n + m, the state space could be manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Model the problem as a DP where each state is (l, c, n0, n1), representing a string of length l, ending with c, with n0 0s and n1 1s.\n\n- The transitions are the possible modifications: for each possible state, apply all possible modification options, leading to new states.\n\n- The goal is to compute the number of initial strings s (with n0 = n, n1 = m, l = n + m, c can be 0 or 1) that can reach a state where the last character is g after some modifications.\n\nWait, but the initial state is a string of length l = n + m, with n0 = n, n1 = m, and the last character can be either 0 or 1. So for the initial state, the last character is variable.\n\nBut the initial string s can have any arrangement of 0s and 1s, as long as the counts are correct. So the initial state's last character is part of the possibilities.\n\nSo the idea is to model all possible states reachable from the initial states (all possible arrangements of 0s and 1s with n0 = n, n1 = m, and any last character). Then, for each such initial state, determine if it can reach a state where the last character is g after some modifications.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive. Perhaps a better approach is to precompute for each possible state whether it can reach a state ending with g.\n\nWait, but considering that the initial state can vary in terms of the last character, perhaps it's better to model the problem as whether the initial string can be modified to end with g, regardless of the initial last character.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that the initial string can be modified in any way, and the key is whether, through some sequence of modifications, the string can end with g.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a graph problem where each node represents a possible state (last character, counts of 0s and 1s, length), and edges represent possible modifications.\n\nThe goal is to find all initial states (n0 = n, n1 = m, l = n+m, last character can be 0 or 1) that can reach a state where the last character is g.\n\nBut this seems computationally heavy. Given that n and m can be up to 105, the possible counts are manageable, but the length can be up to 210, so the state space could be manageable.\n\nSo, let's formalize the DP approach.\n\nDefine dp[l][c][n0][n1] as the number of ways to reach a state of length l, ending with character c, with n0 0s and n1 1s.\n\nThe transitions are based on the possible modifications:\n\nFor each state (l, c_prev, n0_prev, n1_prev), we can perform a modification if l >= 2.\n\nThe modification will create a new state (l_new = l - 1, c_new, n0_new, n1_new).\n\nThe c_new and the new counts depend on the last two characters.\n\nWait, but in the state, we only track the last character. So for a state with last character c_prev, to perform a modification, we need to know the second last character as well. But since we only track the last character, we lose information about the previous one.\n\nThis is a problem because the modification depends on the last two characters.\n\nThus, the state needs to track the last two characters, not just the last one.\n\nSo the state should be (l, c1, c2, n0, n1), where c1 is the penultimate character and c2 is the last character. But that complicates things because now the state has four variables.\n\nGiven that the length can be up to 210, and each character is 0 or 1, the state space becomes manageable.\n\nSo the state is (l, c_prev, c_curr, n0, n1), where c_prev is the penultimate character, and c_curr is the last character.\n\nBut wait, when performing a modification, we replace the last two characters (c_prev and c_curr) with a new character. So the new state will have l-1, and the new last character is determined by c_prev and c_curr.\n\nSo for the transition, given the current state (l, c_prev, c_curr, n0, n1), we can perform a modification to get a new state (l-1, new_c, new_n0, new_n1).\n\nThe new_c is determined by c_prev and c_curr:\n\n- If c_prev == c_curr == 0: new_c is 1.\n- Else: new_c is 0.\n\nThen, the new_n0 and new_n1 are computed based on c_prev, c_curr, and the current n0 and n1.\n\nLet me compute how the counts change:\n\nCase 1: c_prev = 0, c_curr = 0.\n\nWe replace them with 1.\n\nSo, new_n0 = n0 - 2.\n\nnew_n1 = n1 + 1.\n\nCase 2: c_prev = 1, c_curr = 1.\n\nReplace with 0.\n\nnew_n0 = n0 + 1.\n\nnew_n1 = n1 - 2.\n\nCase 3: c_prev != c_curr (i.e., 0 and 1 or 1 and 0).\n\nReplace with 0.\n\nnew_n0 = n0 - 1 (since two 0s and one 1 are replaced by one 0: net loss of one 0, two 1s are replaced by one 0? Wait, no.\n\nWait, when you have two different characters, you replace them with a 0. So:\n\nNumber of 0s before: suppose the two are 0 and 1.\n\nSo, two 0s and one 1 are present in the last two positions.\n\nAfter replacement, you add one 0, and remove the two.\n\nSo, the new_n0 is (n0 - 1), because two 0s are removed and one is added.\n\nWait, no: the last two are 0 and 1, so n0_prev includes those two. So when you replace them with a 0, you subtract two 0s and add one, so n0_prev becomes n0_prev - 2 + 1 = n0_prev -1.\n\nSimilarly, n1_prev includes one 1, so it's subtracted, giving n1_prev - 1.\n\nSo for case 3:\n\nnew_n0 = n0_prev - 1\n\nnew_n1 = n1_prev - 1\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor each state (l, c_prev, c_curr, n0, n1), the modification leads to a new state (l-1, new_c, new_n0, new_n1) as follows:\n\nif c_prev == c_curr:\n\n   if c_prev == 0:\n\n       new_c = 1\n\n       new_n0 = n0 - 2\n\n       new_n1 = n1 + 1\n\n   else:\n\n       new_c = 0\n\n       new_n0 = n0 + 1\n\n       new_n1 = n1 - 2\n\nelse:\n\n   new_c = 0\n\n   new_n0 = n0 - 1\n\n   new_n1 = n1 - 1\n\nSo the transitions are as above.\n\nThe base case is when l == 1. In that case, the last character is c_curr, which can be either 0 or 1. So if c_curr is g, then it's a valid state.\n\nOur goal is to compute the number of initial states (l = n + m, c_prev and c_curr can be any combination, as long as n0 = n and n1 = m) that can reach a state where the last character is g.\n\nBut wait, the initial state is a string of length l = n + m, with exactly n 0s and m 1s. The last character can be 0 or 1. So for each possible arrangement of 0s and 1s in the string, the last character is either 0 or 1.\n\nBut since the initial string can have any arrangement, the initial state for the DP is all possible combinations of 0s and 1s that sum to n and m, with any possible last two characters.\n\nBut this seems computationally infeasible because the initial state could be any string, which is 2^(n+m) possibilities. That's way too big.\n\nSo perhaps we need a different approach.\n\nAlternative Idea: Instead of considering all possible initial strings, perhaps model the problem as whether, for a given (n, m), the counts allow the string to be reduced to a string ending with g.\n\nWait, perhaps it's possible to model the problem by considering the parity of certain parameters.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative Approach: Since the problem is to count the number of beautiful strings, which are all the possible strings with exactly n 0s and m 1s, and which can be modified to end with g, perhaps we can model the problem as a function f(n, m, g), which is the number of such beautiful strings.\n\nSo the task is to compute f(n, m, g) modulo 1e9+7.\n\nNow, considering that n and m are up to 105, the maximum possible length is 210.\n\nSo perhaps a dynamic programming approach is feasible.\n\nLet me define dp[l][c][a][b], where:\n\n- l is the current length of the string.\n\n- c is the last character (0 or 1).\n\n- a is the number of 0s.\n\n- b is the number of 1s.\n\ndp[l][c][a][b] represents the number of ways to have a string of length l, ending with character c, with a 0s and b 1s, that can be reduced to a string ending with g after some modifications.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial string is of length n + m, and the problem is to count all such initial strings that can be reduced to a string ending with g.\n\nBut perhaps the DP can represent for each possible state (l, c, a, b), whether it's possible to reach a state where the last character is g.\n\nWait, perhaps the DP can be designed as follows:\n\ndp[l][c][a][b] is True if there exists a way to reach a state where the last character is g, starting from this state.\n\nThen, the answer is the sum over all possible initial states (n + m, *, n, m) where dp[n + m][c][n][m] is True, multiplied by the number of initial strings that have exactly n 0s, m 1s, and end with c.\n\nWait, perhaps more precisely:\n\nThe initial state is a string of length l = n + m, with a = n, b = m. The last character can be 0 or 1. For each possible last character c (0 or 1), the number of such strings is C(l-1, a-1) if c is 0, or C(l-1, b-1) if c is 1.\n\nWait, no. Because the number of strings of length l, ending with c, with a 0s and b 1s is C(l-1, a-1) if c is 0, provided that a >= 1.\n\nWait, no: for a string of length l, ending with c, with a 0s and b 1s, the count is the number of ways to arrange a-1 0s and b 1s in the first l-1 positions, followed by c.\n\nSo for each possible c (0 or 1), the count is:\n\nif c is 0: comb(l-1, a-1)\n\nif c is 1: comb(l-1, b-1)\n\nBut only if a >= 1 or b >= 1, respectively.\n\nSo, for the initial state, the total number of strings is the sum over c in {0,1} of the number of strings ending with c, which is comb(n + m - 1, n - 1) if c is 0, else comb(n + m - 1, m - 1).\n\nWait, but this is only true if the initial string has exactly a = n 0s and b = m 1s. So the count for each c is as described.\n\nBut in the problem, the initial string must have exactly a = n and b = m, so the number of such strings is C(n + m, n), but for each ending character, it's C(n + m -1, n -1) if the last character is 0, and similarly for 1.\n\nSo, for each c in {0, 1}, the number of initial strings ending with c is:\n\nif c is 0: C(n + m -1, n-1)\n\nif c is 1: C(n + m -1, m-1)\n\nBut we need to ensure that a = n and b = m, so for c=0, a must be at least 1, and for c=1, b must be at least 1.\n\nWait, but if a=0 and c=0, that's impossible. So the initial count for c=0 is C(n + m -1, n-1) only if n >= 1. Similarly for c=1.\n\nSo, the initial number of strings is:\n\nsum_{c=0,1} [ if c == 0 and n >=1: C(n + m -1, n-1) else if c == 1 and m >=1: C(n + m -1, m-1) else 0 ]\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute for both c=0 and c=1, and then multiply by the appropriate binomial coefficients, considering the cases where n or m is zero.\n\nOnce we have the initial count for each c, we can model the DP.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute all necessary binomial coefficients modulo 1e9+7, up to 210 choose 105.\n\n2. For each possible state (l, c, a, b), compute whether it can be reduced to a string ending with g.\n\n3. For the initial state (l = n + m, any c, a = n, b = m), compute whether it can reach a state where the last character is g.\n\n4. Sum the initial counts (number of strings ending with c) for which the DP returns True.\n\nSo, the DP can be implemented as follows:\n\nWe'll use memoization or iterative DP to track for each state whether it can reach a state ending with g.\n\nWe can represent the DP as a dictionary or a 4-dimensional array, but given the constraints, it's manageable.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Precompute binomial coefficients mod 1e9+7 up to 210.\n\n- Initialize the DP for all possible states.\n\n- For each state (l, c_prev, c_curr, a, b), check if we can perform a modification to reach a new state.\n\n- The base case is when l == 1. Then, the last character is c_curr, so if c_curr == g, then it's a success.\n\n- For each state, if it's possible to reach a successful state, mark it as True",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that can be modified to end with a specific character. A beautiful string is defined as a string consisting only of 0s and 1s, with exactly n zeros and m ones. The modifications allowed are replacing the last two characters with a new character based on their values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP approach where each state is represented by the current length of the string, the last two characters, the count of zeros, and the count of ones. This helps us track whether a string can be reduced to end with the target character after some modifications.\n\n2. **State Transitions**: For each state, we consider all possible modifications. Each modification changes the last character and the counts of zeros and ones. We update the DP table accordingly.\n\n3. **Base Case**: If the length of the string is 1, the string ends with its only character. If this character matches the target character, it is valid.\n\n4. **Precomputation**: We precompute binomial coefficients modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to efficiently count the number of valid initial strings ending with each character.\n\n5. **Combining Results**: We sum the results for all valid initial strings that can be modified to end with the target character.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    from math import comb\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    m = int(input[1])\n    g = int(input[2])\n    \n    max_len = n + m\n    max_comb = max_len\n    # Precompute binomial coefficients mod MOD up to max_len\n    comb_table = [[0] * (max_len + 1) for _ in range(max_len + 1)]\n    for i in range(max_len + 1):\n        comb_table[i][0] = 1\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            comb_table[i][j] = (comb_table[i-1][j-1] + comb_table[i-1][j]) % MOD\n    \n    from functools import lru_cache\n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(l, c_prev, c_curr, a, b):\n        if l == 1:\n            return c_curr == g\n        res = False\n        # Try all possible modifications\n        if l >= 2:\n            # Modification based on c_prev and c_curr\n            if c_prev == c_curr:\n                if c_prev == 0:\n                    new_c = 1\n                    new_a = a - 2\n                    new_b = b + 1\n                else:\n                    new_c = 0\n                    new_a = a + 1\n                    new_b = b - 2\n                if new_a < 0 or new_b < 0:\n                    pass\n                else:\n                    res |= dp(l-1, None, new_c, new_a, new_b)\n            else:\n                new_c = 0\n                new_a = a - 1\n                new_b = b - 1\n                if new_a >= 0 and new_b >= 0:\n                    res |= dp(l-1, c_prev, new_c, new_a, new_b)\n        # Check other possible previous states?
