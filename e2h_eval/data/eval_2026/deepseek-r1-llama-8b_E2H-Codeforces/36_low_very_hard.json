The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about radio towers in towns. There are n+2 towns, numbered from 0 to n+1. We build a tower in each town 1 to n with probability 1/2 each, independently. Then, we assign each built tower a signal power between 1 and n. The goal is to set these powers such that:\n\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 get no signal.\n2. Each of the towns 1 to n gets exactly one signal.\n\nWe need to compute the probability of being able to do this, modulo 998244353.\n\nHmm. So the probability is the number of valid configurations divided by the total possible configurations, which is (2^n). Because each tower is built or not with probability 1/2, so 2^n possibilities.\n\nBut how to count the valid configurations?\n\nLet me think about what makes a configuration valid.\n\nEach town from 1 to n must be covered exactly once. Also, the signal can't reach town 0 or n+1.\n\nSo for a given set S of built towers, can we assign signal powers such that every town 1..n is covered exactly once, and 0 and n+1 are not covered?\n\nWait, but the way the signal works is that a tower at i with power p covers all towns c where |c -i| < p. So the coverage is [i - p + 1, i + p -1], right? Because |c-i| < p implies c is in (i-p, i+p), so excluding i-p and i+p. Wait, no: |c-i| < p means c is greater than i-p and less than i+p. So the coverage is the interval (i-p, i+p). But since c is an integer, the covered towns are those where c is >= i-p+1 and <= i+p-1.\n\nSo for example, if a tower is at position i=2 and has p=2, it covers towns 1, 2, 3. Because 2-2+1=1 and 2+2-1=3.\n\nBut wait, in the sample given when n=5, they built towers in 2,4,5. They set 2's p=2 (covers 1,2,3), 4's p=1 (covers 4), 5's p=1 (covers 5). So yes, that works.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: find a set of intervals (from the built towers) such that each interval is non-overlapping, except for the endpoints, and collectively they cover exactly 1..n, and also no interval extends beyond 0 or n+1.\n\nWait, but each interval is determined by the tower's position and power. So the intervals must form a partition of {1, 2, ..., n}, with each interval assigned to exactly one tower.\n\nThis sounds similar to tiling the line with certain blocks, where each block is an interval defined by a tower's position and power.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nPerhaps another approach: the valid configurations are those sets S where the built towers can be arranged as a perfect matching of intervals covering all towns 1..n, without any overlaps, and without touching 0 or n+1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be thought of in terms of independent intervals. For example, each tower's interval must not only cover a part of the towns but also not interfere with others.\n\nWait, maybe dynamic programming can help here. Let's consider dp[i] as the probability that the first i towns can be covered correctly.\n\nBut I'm not sure yet. Let me think differently.\n\nWhat is the condition for a set S to be valid? It must be possible to assign each tower in S a power such that their coverage intervals are non-overlapping and exactly cover 1..n.\n\nWait, but the intervals must be such that:\n\n- Each interval is of the form [a, b], where a = i - p + 1 and b = i + p -1.\n\n- All these intervals are disjoint.\n\n- Their union is exactly {1, 2, ..., n}.\n\nAdditionally, the intervals must not extend beyond 0 or n+1.\n\nSo the first step is to model the problem in terms of these intervals.\n\nLet me think about the possible intervals. Each interval is determined by its start and end points. For a tower at position i, the maximum possible power is such that the interval doesn't touch 0 or n+1. So for i=1, the leftmost possible coverage is [1, 2p-1]. To avoid covering 0, 1 - p + 1 > 0 => p < 2. Since p is at least 1, the maximum p for i=1 is 1, which covers [1,1].\n\nSimilarly",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that we can set the signal powers of radio towers such that each town from 1 to n is covered exactly once, while towns 0 and n+1 are not covered. This probability must be computed modulo 998244353.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be approached by recognizing that the valid configurations of towers form a perfect partition of the towns using non-overlapping intervals. Each interval is determined by the position of a tower and its signal power. The key insight is to use dynamic programming to count the number of valid configurations and then compute the probability based on these counts.\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We define `dp[i]` as the number of ways to cover the first `i` towns (from 1 to i) with valid intervals.\n2. **Transition State**: For each town `i`, consider all possible valid intervals ending at `i`. Each interval can start from some town `j` where `j < i` and ensure no overlap with previously considered intervals.\n3. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be modulo 998244353, we use modular arithmetic to keep our numbers manageable and avoid overflow.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\nn = int(input())\n\n# dp[i] represents the number of ways to cover the first i towns\ndp = [0] * (n + 1)\ndp[0] = 1\n\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    # Consider all possible intervals ending at i\n    for j in range(1, i + 1):\n        # The interval must start at least at i - p + 1, but since p >=1, j can be from 1 to i\n        # But the interval cannot extend beyond i\n        # Also, the starting point j must be such that there's a tower built at j, which is part of the configuration\n        # Wait, but in our DP approach, it's about the structure of intervals, not the actual built towers.\n        # Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem here.\n        # Oh wait, the DP approach I thought was incorrect because the built towers are a subset, but the DP is considering all possible valid interval arrangements regardless of the specific towers built.\n        # That's not correct. So perhaps the initial approach is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is needed. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative Approach:\nThe problem can be modeled using combinatorics and inclusion-exclusion principles. Specifically, we need to count the number of valid subsets of towers that can form a partition of the towns into non-overlapping intervals. Each interval corresponds to a tower's coverage area.\n\n1. **Valid Configurations**: A valid configuration is a set of intervals that exactly cover towns 1 to n without overlapping and without touching towns 0 or n+1.\n2. **Counting Valid Configurations**: Use dynamic programming to count the number of ways to partition the towns into such intervals.\n3. **Probability Calculation**: The probability is the number of valid configurations divided by 2^n, computed modulo 998244353 using modular inverses.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\nn = int(input())\n\n# Precompute factorial and inverse factorial up to n\nmax_n = n\nfact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\nfor i in range(1, max_n + 1):\n    fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD\n\ninv_fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\ninv_fact[max_n] = pow(fact[max_n], MOD-2, MOD)\nfor i in range(max_n -1, -1, -1):\n    inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD\n\ndef comb(n, k):\n    if k < 0 or k > n:\n        return 0\n    return fact[n] * inv_fact[k] % MOD * inv_fact[n -k] % MOD\n\ndp = [0] * (n + 1)\ndp[0] = 1\n\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    # For each possible last interval ending at i\n    for l in range(1, i + 1):\n        # The last interval can start at any position from (i - p + 1) to i\n        # But p must be at least 1, so the earliest start is 1\n        # So the last interval can start anywhere from 1 to i, but must form a valid interval\n        # Also, the start must be such that there's a tower built there, but in our DP, we are not tracking which towers are built, only the structure of the intervals\n        # So perhaps the DP approach is not sufficient, and a different method is needed.\n        # Another way: the number of valid sets S is equal to the number of compositions of n into certain parts.\n        # Alternatively, think about the problem as counting the number of tilings with certain tiles.\n        # Each tile is an interval [a, b], and the tiles must cover 1..n exactly once, with no overlaps.\n\n        # For each possible end at i, the start can be anywhere from 1 to i, but the interval must be valid.\n        # So for each possible start j, where 1 <= j <= i, and the interval [j, i] is valid (i.e., j - 1 < 1 and i + 1 < n+1? No, that's not right.)\n        # Wait, the interval [j, i] must not include town 0 or n+1. So j must be >=1 and i <=n.\n        # Which is always true since i ranges from 1 to n.\n\n        # So for each i, the possible starts j can be any from 1 to i, but the interval [j, i] must be such that j is the starting position of a tower, and the interval doesn't extend beyond 0 or n+1.\n\n        # But in our problem, the towers are built randomly. So the presence of a tower at j is a binary choice. However, in the DP approach, we are not tracking which towers are built, but rather the structure of the intervals.\n\n        # So perhaps the DP[i] should represent the number of ways to have a valid configuration covering up to i, considering the towers built along the way.\n\n        # But this seems complicated. Maybe another way: the valid configurations correspond to certain types of trees or structures.\n\n        # Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct solution involves precomputing the number of valid subsets S, which is the same as the number of ways to tile the line with certain blocks.\n\n        # After some research, this problem is similar to tiling a 1xn grid with dominoes and trominoes, but in this case, the tiles are variable-length intervals.\n\n        # It turns out that the number of valid configurations is equal to the (n)th Fibonacci number. But I'm not sure.\n\n        # Alternatively, the number of valid configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose positions for the towers such that their intervals form a partition.\n\n        # For example, when n=2, the valid configurations are when both towers are built, and each has power 1. So 1 way. When n=3, the valid configurations are either having all three towers built with power 1, or having the middle tower with power 3. So 2 ways. So the sequence seems to match the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n        # So perhaps the number of valid configurations is the (n)th Fibonacci number. Then the probability is Fib(n) / 2^n.\n\n        # Testing small cases:\n        # n=1: only one tower, must have power 1. So 1 way. Probability 1/2.\n        # n=2: only when both towers are built, each with power 1. So 1 way. Probability 1/4.\n        # n=3: two ways. Probability 2/8 = 1/4.\n        # n=4: fib(4)=3. So 3/16.\n\n        # Looking at the sample input:\n        # For n=2, the output is 748683265, which is 1/4 mod MOD.\n        # For n=3, the output is 748683265, which is 1/4 mod MOD.\n        # So perhaps the number of valid configurations is the (n)th Fibonacci number.\n\n        # Therefore, the solution is to compute the nth Fibonacci number, compute the modular inverse of 2^n, multiply them, and take modulo MOD.\n\n        # So the steps are:\n        # 1. Compute Fib(n) modulo MOD.\n        # 2. Compute 2^n modulo MOD.\n        # 3. Compute the inverse of 2^n modulo MOD.\n        # 4.
