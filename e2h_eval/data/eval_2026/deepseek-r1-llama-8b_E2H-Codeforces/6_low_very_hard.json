Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Leha who wants to split his vacation into two parts using two vouchers. The goal is to find the minimal total cost of such two vouchers that don't overlap and their durations add up exactly to x.\n\nHmm, let's break down the problem.\n\nSo, each voucher has a start day li, end day ri, and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. We need to choose two different vouchers i and j such that:\n\n1. Their durations sum exactly to x.\n2. They don't intersect. That means either the end of one is before the start of the other, or vice versa.\n3. The total cost is as minimal as possible.\n\nIf no such pair exists, we output -1.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this efficiently because n can be up to 2e5, which is pretty big. So any O(n^2) approach is out of the question; that would be way too slow.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the solution.\n\nFor each voucher, maybe we can precompute what other vouchers could form a valid pair with it. But even that might not be efficient if done naively.\n\nWait, but for a pair (i, j), the sum of their durations must be x. So for each voucher i, the required duration of another voucher j would be x - duration_i.\n\nSo perhaps for each voucher, we can find all vouchers that have the required duration and then check if they are non-overlapping.\n\nBut how do we efficiently find such vouchers?\n\nAnother thought: for each voucher, we can record its start and end time, along with its cost. Then, for each possible duration d that could pair with the current voucher's duration, we look for vouchers with duration d that don't overlap.\n\nBut even this could be expensive if not handled properly.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Preprocess each voucher to compute its duration and store along with li, ri, cost.\n\n2. For each voucher i, we calculate the needed duration d = x - duration_i.\n\n3. Now, we need to find all vouchers j where duration_j == d and j is not overlapping with i.\n\n4. Among these, select the one with minimal cost and see if the total (i's cost + j's cost) is better than the current minimum.\n\nBut the problem is step 3: how to find j's efficiently.\n\nWait, but how do we represent the vouchers in a way that allows us to quickly query for non-overlapping vouchers with a specific duration?\n\nHmm, perhaps we can group vouchers by their duration. For each possible duration d, we have a list of vouchers with that duration. Then, for each voucher i, we can look into the group for d = x - duration_i, and find vouchers j that don't overlap with i.\n\nBut even that might require checking a lot of vouchers for each i.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can sort the vouchers in a way that allows us to perform binary searches for possible candidates.\n\nLet me think about the non-overlapping condition. Voucher j must satisfy either rj < li or lj > ri.\n\nSo for each voucher i, when looking for j's in the group d, we can consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: j ends before i starts. So rj < li.\n\nCase 2: j starts after i ends. So lj > ri.\n\nSo for each i, we need to find in the group d, the minimal cost j that satisfies either case.\n\nBut how can we efficiently find such j's?\n\nPerhaps we can pre-sort the vouchers for each duration group.\n\nFor example, for each duration d, we can have two sorted lists:\n\n- One sorted by ri, so that for a given li, we can quickly find all j's with rj < li.\n\n- Another sorted by lj, so that for a given ri, we can quickly find all j's with lj > ri.\n\nWait, that makes sense.\n\nSo for each d, we'll have two sorted lists:\n\n- Sorted by ri in ascending order. This will help in case 1, where j ends before i starts.\n\n- Sorted by lj in ascending order. This will help in case 2, where j starts after i ends.\n\nAdditionally, for each group, we can keep track of the minimal cost for any prefix or suffix of the sorted list. Because in case 1, we want the minimal cost among all j's with rj < li. Similarly, in case 2, the minimal cost among j's with lj > ri.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Preprocess each voucher into a structure containing li, ri, cost, and duration. Compute the duration for each voucher.\n\n2. Group all vouchers by their duration. For each duration d, create two sorted lists:\n\n   a. List A: sorted by ri in ascending order. Each entry also stores the minimal cost up to",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers whose combined duration equals exactly `x` days and whose total cost is minimized. The approach involves efficiently searching for valid pairs of vouchers using sorting and preprocessing to handle the constraints effectively.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Preprocessing Vouchers**: Each voucher is processed to compute its duration and stored along with its start day, end day, and cost.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration. For each duration, we maintain two sorted lists:\n   - One sorted by the end day (ri) for efficient lookup of vouchers ending before a given start day.\n   - Another sorted by the start day (li) for efficient lookup of vouchers starting after a given end day.\n3. **Binary Search for Minimal Cost**: For each voucher, we determine the required duration of the second voucher to sum up to `x`. We then use binary search within the relevant groups to find the minimal cost voucher that does not overlap with the current voucher.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n, x = int(input[idx]), int(input[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[idx])\n        ri = int(input[idx+1])\n        cost = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx +=3\n        duration = ri - li + 1\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, cost, duration))\n    \n    # Group vouchers by their duration\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    duration_groups = defaultdict(list)\n    for v in vouchers:\n        d = v[3]\n        duration_groups[d].append(v)\n    \n    min_total_cost = float('inf')\n    found = False\n    \n    # For each voucher, look for another voucher with duration x - current.duration\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_li, current_ri, current_cost, current_d = vouchers[i]\n        needed_d = x - current_d\n        if needed_d < 0:\n            continue\n        \n        if needed_d not in duration_groups:\n            continue\n        \n        # Case 1: j ends before i starts (rj < li)\n        # We need j's where rj < li, and find the one with minimal cost\n        group = duration_groups[needed_d]\n        # Sort group by ri\n        sorted_by_ri = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        # Find all j where rj < current_li\n        # To find the first j where rj >= current_li, everything before is valid\n        pos = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_by_ri, (current_li, 0, 0), key=lambda x: x[1]) \n        # All j's up to pos-1 are candidates\n        if pos > 0:\n            # Find the minimal cost in the first pos elements\n            min_cost = min(sorted_by_ri[:pos][::-1], key=lambda x: x[2])\n            total = current_cost + min_cost[2]\n            if total < min_total_cost:\n                min_total_cost = total\n                found = True\n        \n        # Case 2: j starts after i ends (lj > ri)\n        # Sort group by lj\n        sorted_by_lj = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        pos = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_by_lj, (current_ri, float('inf'), float('inf')), key=lambda x: x[0])\n        if pos < len(sorted_by_lj):\n            # Find the minimal cost in the elements from pos onwards\n            min_cost = min(sorted_by_lj[pos:], key=lambda x: x[2])\n            total = current_cost + min_cost[2]\n            if total < min_total_cost:\n                min_total_cost = total\n                found = True\n    \n    if found:\n        print(min_total_cost)\n    else:\n        print(-1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers, each represented by its start day, end day, cost, and duration.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration to facilitate efficient lookup of potential pairs.\n3. **Sorting and Binary Search**: For each voucher, the algorithm checks for valid pairs by sorting the groups and using binary search to find non-overlapping vouchers with the required duration, ensuring minimal cost computation through efficient lookups and checks.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimal cost pair of vouchers without overlapping, leveraging sorting and binary search to handle the constraints effectively.",
