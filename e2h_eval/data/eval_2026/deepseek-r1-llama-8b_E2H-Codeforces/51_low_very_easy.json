Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to check if the pile of letters can exactly form the two names given. Hmm, right.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again. Oh right, the input consists of three lines: guest's name, host's name, and the pile. We need to check if the pile is a rearrangement of all the letters from both names combined. So basically, the total count of each letter in the pile should equal the sum of counts from the two names.\n\nSo, how do I approach this? Well, I think I can count the frequency of each character in each of the three parts and then compare.\n\nWait, wait. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll need to process each string: guest, host, and pile. For each, I'll create a frequency dictionary that counts how many times each character appears.\n\nThen, I'll combine the guest and host's frequency dictionaries. Because together, they should make up the pile's frequency. So, for each character, the sum of guest and host's counts should equal the pile's count.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to first combine the guest and host into one string, then compare its frequency with the pile's frequency.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, step by step:\n\n1. Read the three lines: guest, host, pile.\n2. Concatenate guest and host to get the expected combined string.\n3. Check if the sorted version of this combined string equals the sorted version of the pile. If yes, output YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, because if the combined length is not equal to the pile's length, then immediately it's impossible. So, first, check if len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, return NO.\n\nOtherwise, sort both and compare.\n\nYes, that's a straightforward approach.\n\nFor example, in the sample input:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS\nHost: DEDMOROZ\nCombined: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\n\nPile: BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sample input's pile is 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER'? Or wait, perhaps the third line is the entire pile.\n\nWait, the sample input shows the third line as 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER'? Or maybe not—perhaps the input is three lines, which when joined, form the pile.\n\nWait, no, the third line is the pile, as per the problem statement. So, for example, in the first sample, the guest is 'SANTACLAUS', host is 'DEDMOROZ', and the pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nWhen we combine guest and host, the combined string is 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ' which, when sorted, should match the sorted pile.\n\nYes, because the sample output is YES.\n\nIn the second sample, the guest is 'PAPAINOEL', host is 'JOULUPUKKI'. Their combined length is 10 + 10 = 20. The pile's length is... let's see: 'PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKIJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI'—wait, no. Wait, the second sample's pile is 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER'. Oh, no, wait, the second sample's input is:\n\nThe three lines are:\n['PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', ...] No, wait, looking at the note in the problem statement.\n\nWait, the sample input in the problem is written as:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, no, the input is three lines: the first is the guest's name, the second is the host's name, the third is the pile.\n\nSo, for the second sample, the guest is 'PAPAINOEL', the host is 'JOULUPUKKI', and the pile is 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI' (but wait, the third line is 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI' or is it a multi-line string? Wait,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the pile of letters found at the door can be rearranged to form both the guest's name and the host's name exactly. This means that the total count of each letter in the guest's and host's names combined should match the count of letters in the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the three lines of input which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Check Lengths**: If the combined length of the guest's and host's names does not match the length of the pile, immediately return \"NO\".\n4. **Sort and Compare**: Sort both the combined string and the pile string. If they are identical, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the exact match of letter counts by leveraging sorting, which is straightforward and effective for this problem.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read the input lines\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\n# Combine guest and host names\ncombined = guest + host\n\n# Check if the lengths match\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Sort both combined and pile strings\n    if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads three lines of input corresponding to the guest's name, host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's and host's names are concatenated into a single string to form the expected combined string.\n3. **Length Check**: The combined length is compared with the pile's length. If they do not match, it is impossible to form the names, so the result is \"NO\".\n4. **Sorting and Comparison**: Both the combined string and the pile string are sorted. If they match exactly, it means the pile can be rearranged to form both names, resulting in \"YES\". Otherwise, the result is \"NO\".\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem by ensuring that all characters and their counts match exactly between the combined names and the pile, providing a clear and concise answer.",
