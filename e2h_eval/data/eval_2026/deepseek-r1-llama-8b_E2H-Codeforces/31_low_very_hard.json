Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Vanya is trying to balance the sum of his found cards to zero. The problem gives me the number of found cards (n) and the maximum absolute value x on any card. Also, it's given that all the found cards have numbers within -x to x. My task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find to make the total sum zero.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I should calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. We want the total sum after adding some cards to be zero. So, the sum of the additional cards should be -S. Let's denote this required sum as T = -S.\n\nNow, each additional card can contribute a value between -x and x. But since we're trying to minimize the number of cards, each card should contribute as much as possible towards T. So, each card should be of maximum possible absolute value, which is x. \n\nWait, but depending on the sign of T, the direction matters. For example, if T is positive, we need cards with positive values, and if T is negative, negative cards. But each card can only contribute up to x per card.\n\nSo, the minimal number of cards would be the ceiling of |T| / x. Because each card contributes at most x towards the sum. \n\nBut wait, what if T is zero? Then no additional cards are needed. That's an edge case I need to consider.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the input: n, x, and the list of found card numbers.\n2. Compute the sum S of these numbers.\n3. Calculate T = -S.\n4. If T is zero, output 0.\n5. Otherwise, compute the minimal number of cards as the ceiling of |T| / x.\n6. Output this number.\n\nWait, but let's test this logic against the examples provided.\n\nFirst example:\nInput: 3 2\nCards: -1, 1, 2\nSum S = (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So T is -2. So |T|=2. x=2. 2/2=1. So minimal cards is 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond example:\nInput: 2 3\nCards: -2, -2\nSum S = -4. T=4. |T|=4. x=3. 4/3 is 1.333, so ceiling is 2. So two cards each of 2 (since 3 is the max, but wait, 3 is allowed. Wait, why not use two 2s? Oh, because 2*2=4. So yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but 4 divided by 3 is 1.333, which when you take the ceiling, is 2. So that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: Suppose S is 5, x is 3. T is -5, so |T|=5. 5/3 is ~1.666, so ceiling is 2. So two cards: 3 and 2, sum to 5. Or 3 and 3 is 6, which is more than 5, so that's not allowed. Wait, but in that case, the sum has to be exactly T. So each card must add exactly x towards the sum. Wait, no, because each card can be any value between -x and x. So, for T=5 and x=3, the minimal number is 2: 3+2=5. So that works.\n\nWait another scenario: S=0. So T=0. No cards needed.\n\nWhat if S is 1, x is 1. Then T=-1. So one card is needed.\n\nWhat if S is 4, x is 3. T is -4. 4/3 is 1.333, ceiling is 2. So two cards: 3 and 1. Sum is 4.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nThe steps in code:\n\n- Read n and x from input.\n- Read the list of integers as the found cards.\n- Compute S = sum of the found cards.\n- T = -S.\n- If T == 0: print 0.\n- Else: compute the minimal number of cards as (abs(T) + x -1) // x. Because integer division using ceiling.\n- Print that number.\n\nWait, wait: Let's see. For |T|=4 and x=3: (4 +3-1)//3 = (6)//3=2. Correct.\n\nFor |T|=5, x=3: (5+3-1)/3=7/3=2.333",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards (found and additional) equals zero. Each card can have a value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: Compute the sum of the values on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Target Sum**: The target sum for the additional cards is the negative of the current sum. This is because we want the total sum to be zero.\n3. **Check for Zero Need**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Cards**: If a non-zero target sum exists, compute the minimum number of additional cards required. Each card can contribute up to x towards the target sum. The minimum number of cards is given by the ceiling of the absolute value of the target sum divided by x.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent_sum = sum(cards)\ntarget = -current_sum\n\nif target == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    minimal_cards = (abs(target) + x - 1) // x\n    print(minimal_cards)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers followed by a list of integers representing the found cards.\n- **Current Sum Calculation**: We compute the sum of the found cards.\n- **Target Sum Calculation**: The target sum for the additional cards is the negative of the current sum.\n- **Zero Check**: If the target sum is zero, print 0 as no additional cards are needed.\n- **Minimum Cards Calculation**: For a non-zero target sum, calculate the minimum number of cards needed using integer division to achieve the ceiling effect, ensuring we get the smallest number of cards needed to reach or exceed the target sum.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of additional cards required using basic arithmetic operations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
