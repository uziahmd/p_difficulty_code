    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem correctly. The task is to find the maximum possible length of a substring that occurs two or more times in the input string. The occurrences can overlap. For example, in the sample input 'ababa', the substring 'aba' appears twice, overlapping each other. So the output is 3.\n\nLet me consider some examples. If the input is 'abcd', all substrings are unique, so the answer is 0. For 'zzz', the substrings 'zz' and 'zz' appear (overlapping), so the answer is 2.\n\nSo the approach is to check all possible substrings of the string, starting from the longest possible, and see if any of them appears more than once.\n\nHow do I generate all possible substrings and check their occurrences efficiently?\n\nI think I can loop through possible lengths, starting from the largest possible down to 1. For each possible length L, I'll generate all substrings of that length and see if any appears more than once.\n\nThe steps could be:\n\n1. Iterate L from len(s) down to 1.\n   - For each L, collect all substrings of length L.\n   - Check if any substring appears at least twice.\n   - If yes, return L as the answer.\n\nWait, but for each L, I might have multiple substrings. How to efficiently check if any of these substrings occur more than once?\n\nAnother approach: For each possible L, create a set of all substrings of length L. If the size of this set is less than the number of such substrings, that means there are duplicates. So, for a given L, if the number of substrings (which is len(s) - L + 1) is greater than the size of the set, then there must be duplicates.\n\nWait, no. Because the same substring can appear multiple times, but the set will only store unique ones. So if the count of substrings (n = len(s)-L+1) is greater than the size of the set (s), then s must have duplicates.\n\nSo for each L from len(s) down to 1:\n   - n = len(s) - L + 1\n   - create a set of all substrings of length L\n   - if n > len(set), then return L as the answer.\n\nThat makes sense. So the algorithm would be:\n\nFor L in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n    substrings = set()\n    for i in range(len(s) - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        substrings.add(substr)\n    if len(substrings) < (len(s) - L + 1):\n        return L\n\nIf we find such an L, that's the maximum possible. So we can stop and return it.\n\nLet's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 'abcd' \nLength is 4. We check L=4: only one substring, so no duplicates. Then L=3: each substring is unique. Similarly, L=2, L=1. All have no duplicates, so output is 0.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa' \nCheck L=5: only one substring. L=4: two substrings, which are 'baba' and 'abab'? Wait wait, no, 'ababa' has substrings of length 4: positions 0-4 (no, wait, indices are 0-based. So for L=4, the substrings are s[0:4] = 'abab' and s[1:5] = 'baba'. These are different. So the set size is 2, which is less than 2? No, wait len(s)-L+1 is 2, so the condition is len(substrings) < 2? No, because len is 2 which equals 2. So move on.\n\nL=3: substrings are 'aba' (positions 0-3), 'bab' (1-4), 'aba' (2-5). So the set is {'aba', 'bab'}, which has size 2. But len(s)-L+1 is 3, so 2 < 3. So yes, return 3.\n\nSample 3: 'zzz'\nCheck L=3: only one substring. L=2: two substrings, 'zz' and 'zz'. So the set has size 1, which is less than 2. So return 2.\n\nYes, this logic seems correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nThe steps for the code:\n\n1. Read the input string. It's given as the first line, but the way it's presented isn't clear. Wait, in the example, the input is ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], but I think that's just the sample input, not the actual input format. Looking back at the problem statement, the input is the first line, which contains the string. So the code should read a single line, stripping any whitespace.\n\nSo in code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nThen, for each L from len(s) down to 1:\n\nfor L in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n\nBut wait, if the string is empty, but according to the problem statement, it's non-empty, so we don't need to handle that case.\n\nFor each L, compute the number of possible substrings: n = len(s) - L + 1.\n\nIf n < 2, then even if L is the maximum possible, but since n is 1, no duplicates. So proceed.\n\nElse, create a set of all substrings of length L. If the size of the set is less than n, then there are duplicates. So return L.\n\nOnce found, print L and exit.\n\nOtherwise, continue checking smaller L.\n\nIf after checking all L down to 1, none found, return 0.\n\nWait, but when L is 1, n is len(s). So for a string like 'aaa', len is 3. L=3: n=1, no. L=2: n=2. Substrings 'aa' and 'aa' → set size 1 < 2 → return 2.\n\nWait, but what if the entire string is made of the same character. For 'aaaaa', len=5. Let's see:\n\nL=5: n=1 → no.\n\nL=4: n=2. Substrings 'aaaa' and 'aaaa' → set size 1 < 2 → return 4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nIn code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor L in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n    n = len(s) - L + 1\n    if n < 2:\n        continue  # not enough substrings\n    substr_set = set()\n    for i in range(n):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        substr_set.add(substr)\n    if len(substr_set) < n:\n        max_len = L\n        break  # since we're checking from largest to smallest\n\nprint(max_len)\n\nWait, but let's test this with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 'abcd' → len=4.\n\nLoop L from 4 down:\n\nL=4: n=1 → skip.\n\nL=3: n=2. Substrings 'abc' and 'bcd' → set size 2 == n → no.\n\nL=2: n=3. Substrings 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' → set size 3 == n → no.\n\nL=1: n=4. Substrings 'a','b','c','d' → set size 4 == n → no.\n\nSo max_len remains 0.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa' → len=5.\n\nL=5: n=1 → skip.\n\nL=4: n=2. Substrings 'abab' and 'baba' → set size 2 → equal to n → no.\n\nL=3: n=3. Substrings 'aba','bab','aba' → set size 2 <3 → yes. So max_len is 3.\n\nSample 3: 'zzz' → len=3.\n\nL=3: n=1 → skip.\n\nL=2: n=2. Substrings 'zz' and 'zz' → set size 1 <2 → yes. So return 2.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaa' → len=4.\n\nCheck L=4: n=1 → skip.\n\nL=3: n=2. Substrings 'aaa' and 'aaa' → set size 1 <2 → return 3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcabc' → len=6.\n\nCheck L=6: n=1 → skip.\n\nL=5: n=2. Substrings 'abcab' and 'bcabc' → different → set size 2 → no.\n\nL=4: n=3. Substrings 'abca','bcab','cabc' → all unique → set size 3 ==n → no.\n\nL=3: n=4. Substrings 'abc','bca','cab','abc' → set size 3 <4 → yes. So return 3.\n\nWhich is correct because 'abc' appears twice.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nWhat about when the string has all unique characters? Like 'abcdxyz'. Then the code returns 0, which is correct.\n\nWhat about when the entire string is a repetition of a substring? Like 'abababab' → the maximum L is 4, since 'abab' appears multiple times.\n\nYes, because for L=4, the substrings are 'abab' repeated.\n\nSo the code would find for L=4, n=7 (since len=8, 8-4+1=5? Wait wait, len(s) is 8, L=4: 8-4+1=5 substrings. Each is 'abab', 'baba', 'abab', 'baba', 'abab' → set size is 2. 2 <5 → yes. So return 4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code looks solid.\n\nThus, the Python code should read the input string, loop L from len(s) down to 1, for each L, calculate the number of substrings, create a set, and check if the set size is less than the number of substrings. If so, return that L as the maximum length.\n\nSo the code is as written above.\n",

For each length `L`, we generate all substrings of that length and check if any of them appear more than once. If a duplicate is found, we return the length `L` as the result.\n\n1. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: Start from the maximum possible length of the string and decrement down to 1.\n2. **Generate Substrings**: For each length `L`, generate all substrings of that length.\n3. **Check for Duplicates**: Use a set to store these substrings. If the number of unique substrings is less than the total number of substrings of that length, it means there are duplicates.\n4. **Return Result**: As soon as a duplicate is found, return the current length `L` as it is the longest valid substring length.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor L in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n    n = len(s) - L + 1\n    if n < 2:\n        continue\n    substr_set = set()\n    for i in range(n):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        substr_set.add(substr)\n    if len(substr_set) < n:\n        max_len = L\n        break\n\nprint(max_len)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n- **Loop Through Lengths**: We loop from the length of the string down to 1 to check the longest possible substrings first.\n- **Substring Generation and Check**: For each length `L`, we generate all possible substrings and store them in a set.
