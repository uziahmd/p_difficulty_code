            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles, and I have to find the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form at least one mentsu. A mentsu can be a triplet (three same tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, I need to process each of the three input strings. Each string represents a tile, like '1s', '2m', etc. So, I'll probably represent each tile as a tuple of (number, suit), which I can convert into integers for easier handling.\n\nSo, step one: parse the input into three tiles. Then, for each possible way of adding tiles (from any of the four suits, but I think we can focus on the existing suits plus others, but maybe it's better to consider all possibilities), compute the minimal draws needed.\n\nWait, no. Wait, she can draw any tiles, including those she already has. So, for example, if she already has a triplet, she doesn't need to draw anything.\n\nSo, the approach is: For each possible way to form a mentsu by adding some tiles, compute how many are needed beyond the initial three, and find the minimal such number across all possibilities.\n\nBut considering all possibilities could be computationally heavy because there are a lot of options. However, since the initial hand is only three tiles, perhaps we can model this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about what constitutes a mentsu. It can be a triplet (all same) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit). So for each tile, we can check if it's part of any possible mentsu, either as part of a triplet or a sequence.\n\nBut wait, the mentsu can consist of any three tiles in her hand after drawing. So, perhaps the approach is to generate all possible mentsu candidates that can be formed by adding some tiles, and then find the minimal number of required draws for each candidate, then choose the smallest among all.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible mentsu, determine whether it can be formed given the current tiles, and calculate the required draws.\n\nBut considering that the number of possible mentsus is manageable, perhaps it's feasible.\n\nWait, the initial hand is three tiles. So, when we add some tiles, the total number of tiles becomes 3 + added. The mentsu is any set of three tiles in the entire collection (after adding) that form a triplet or a sequence.\n\nSo, for each possible mentsu, check if it's possible to form it by adding some tiles, and compute the minimal required.\n\nBut how do I enumerate all possible mentsus?\n\nWait, perhaps instead, I can look for all possible triplets and sequences that can be formed, given the initial tiles plus any number of added tiles, and find the minimal required.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible combination of the initial tiles with added tiles, see if any triplet or sequence exists, and track the minimal number of added tiles required.\n\nBut considering that the initial tiles are only three, the possible mentsu could be:\n\n- Any triplet that can be formed using some of the initial tiles plus some added.\n- Any sequence that can be formed using some of the initial tiles plus some added.\n\nHmm, perhaps the way to approach this is:\n\nFor each possible mentsu (triplet or sequence), compute how many tiles are missing from the initial three, and find the minimal number of tiles to add to get that mentsu.\n\nThen, among all possible mentsus, choose the one that requires the least number of added tiles. Also, note that the mentsu can consist of any three tiles, not necessarily all from the initial.\n\nWait, but the mentsu must consist of exactly three tiles. So, for a given mentsu, the number of tiles needed from the initial plus what's being added should be at least three, but the mentsu itself is three tiles.\n\nWait, no. Because after adding tiles, the total is more than three, but the mentsu is just a subset of three.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each possible triplet (could be three same tiles) or sequence (three consecutive same suit, sequential numbers), determine the minimal number of tiles needed to form such a triplet or sequence, considering that some tiles may already be present.\n\nOnce I have all possible mentsus and their required draws, pick the minimal one.\n\nSo, first, I need to generate all possible mentsus, which includes:\n\n- All possible triplets: for each suit, for each number 1-9, create a triplet of three same tiles (e.g., 1m, 1m, 1m).\n- All possible sequences: for each suit, for each starting number 1-7, create a sequence of three consecutive numbers (e.g., 4m,5m,6m).\n\n",

For each triplet, we count how many of the required tiles are already present and determine how many more are needed. Similarly, for each sequence, we check the presence of consecutive numbers in the same suit and calculate the necessary additions. The minimum number of draws required across all possible triplets and sequences is then determined and printed. This approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal solution by considering all potential mentsus.",
