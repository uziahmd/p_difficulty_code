The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where Xenia is trying to complete her tasks by moving along a ringroad. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem statement says that Xenia lives in a city with n houses arranged in a ring. The traffic is one-way and clockwise. She starts at house 1 and has m tasks. For each task i, she needs to be at house a_i. But not just that—she also has to complete all tasks with numbers less than i. So for the first task (i=1), she must be at a_1, then for the second task, she must be at a_2 after the first is done, and so on.\n\nWait, wait. Oh right, no—the description says she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me read that again.\n\nNo, it's more precise: to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house ai, and she must have completed all tasks with numbers less than i before that. So, for example, the first task is i=1, she must be at a_1, and since there are no tasks before that, she just needs to get there. The second task requires her to be at a_2 after having done task 1. So the order of tasks is fixed as per their indices, but she can process them in any order as long as she does them in the order of their indices.\n\nHmm, no, wait. Maybe the way the problem is phrased is that she has to process the tasks in the order of their indices. Because for the i-th task, she has to be at ai, and all previous j < i tasks must be done before. So the order is 1, 2, ..., m. So she has to visit a_1, then a_2, then a_3, etc., each time after the previous.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the minimal path that starts at 1, and then visits a_1, a_2, ..., a_m in that order. Each move between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time. Since the ring is circular, moving from n to 1 is considered moving forward.\n\nBut wait, what's the optimal way to do this? Because each a_i could be in any position around the ring. So for each step from a_{k} to a_{k+1}, we need to find the minimal distance.\n\nWait, but the initial position is 1. So for the first task, she has to go from 1 to a_1. Then from a_1 to a_2, and so on until a_m.\n\nBut the minimal path would involve finding the shortest possible way to move from the current position to the next required position, considering the circular arrangement.\n\nWait, but each movement is a single step between adjacent houses. So the distance between two points x and y on a circle is min( (y -x) mod n, (x - y) mod n ). Or wait, no—since the ring is arranged in a circle, the minimal steps between x and y is the minimal of (y -x) mod n and (x - y) mod n, but since each step is one unit, the distance is |y -x| if they are in the same direction. Wait, perhaps not. Wait, the ring is circular, so moving clockwise or counter-clockwise. So the minimal distance between x and y is min( (y -x) % n, (x - y) % n ), but actually, the correct formula is the minimal of the two possible paths.\n\nAlternatively, since the ring is unidirectional (traffic is only clockwise), that complicates things. Wait, no—the ring is a one-way road that is clockwise. So you can't move counter-clockwise. So you have to move in the direction of the ring. That changes everything.\n\nOh! Oh right, I completely missed that part. So the ring is a one-way, and the traffic is only in the clockwise direction. So all movement is in the same direction. So the houses are arranged in a circle, and movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction. So to get from house x to y, you can only go through the path that goes clockwise.\n\nWait, but how does that work? Like, if you're at house 4 in a ring of 4, moving clockwise would take you to 1, right? So the arrangement is such that house 1 is connected to 2, which is connected to 3, then 4, then back to 1.\n\nSo, for any two houses x and y, the distance from x to y is the number of steps you have to take going clockwise. So if x is 3 and y is 1 in a 4-house ring, you have to go ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a one-way ringroad in a clockwise direction. Each movement between adjacent houses takes exactly one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must visit each task location in the given order. The ring is circular, meaning after house `n`, she moves back to house 1. Since the traffic is one-way and clockwise, she can only move in that direction.\n2. **Intuition**: For each task, calculate the shortest path from the current house to the next required house. The shortest path on a circular ring can be found by considering the minimal steps in the clockwise direction.\n3. **Algorithm**: \n   - Start at house 1.\n   - For each subsequent task, compute the clockwise distance from the current house to the next task location.\n   - Sum these distances to get the total time required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor i in range(m):\n    target = tasks[i]\n    # Calculate the clockwise distance from current to target\n    if target >= current:\n        dist = target - current\n    else:\n        dist = (n - current) + target\n    total_time += dist\n    current = target\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line lists the task locations.\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task location, compute the clockwise distance from the current house to the task location. This is done by checking if the target is ahead or behind the current position on the ring.\n- **Update Current Position**: After each task, update the current house to the target location.\n- **Output Total Time**: Sum up all the distances to get the total time required to complete all tasks.\n\nThis approach ensures that we always take the shortest possible path in the clockwise direction, which is optimal for this problem.",
