For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine whether a given triad is major, minor, or strange. Hmm, let's break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the problem statement says that a major triad has notes X, Y, Z such that when ordered correctly, the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones and Y to Z is 3. So together, they form a perfect fifth (7 semitones in total). For a minor triad, the distances are 3 and 4 semitones respectively, adding up to 7 as well, but in a different order.\n\nThe input is three notes, like 'C E G', and I need to process them. The output is either 'major', 'minor', or 'strange'.\n\nSo my plan is:\n\n1. Read the three notes.\n2. Generate all possible permutations of these three notes.\n3. For each permutation, check if it forms a major or minor triad.\n4. Once a permutation is found that fits either major or minor, decide which one it is based on the order.\n5. If none fit, it's strange.\n\nBut wait, how do I represent the notes numerically? Because then I can calculate the distances between them.\n\nI think I should assign each note a numerical value based on their position in the scale. Let me list them:\n\nThe order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait. Wait, the problem says the notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, is that correct? Or is H perhaps a typo? Because normally, in music theory, the sequence is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B, and then back to C. Oh, but the problem states that after H comes C again. Wait, maybe the problem uses H instead of B? Or perhaps it's a mistake, but according to the problem statement, H is the last note before C. So the list is:\n\nNotes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nWait, no, wait: the problem says \"the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H.\" So the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So that's 12 notes, right?\n\nWait, count: C (1), C# (2), D (3), D# (4), E (5), F (6), F# (7), G (8), G# (9), A (10), B (11), H (12). Yes, that makes 12 notes. So the order is as above.\n\nSo I'll create a list of the notes in order, with their positions from 0 to 11. Wait, perhaps mapping each note to an index. Like C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc., up to H which is 11.\n\nSo first, I need to create a dictionary or a list that maps each note to its index. Let's make a list called note_order where note_order[i] gives the ith note.\n\nWait, for example, note_order[0] = 'C', note_order[1] = 'C#', ..., note_order[11] = 'H'.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the order is as per the problem: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the indexes would be 0 to 11.\n\nSo I can create a list like:\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for any two notes, say X and Y, the distance from X to Y is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. Because the scale is cyclic. But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower note to the higher one, so for two consecutive notes, the distance is 1 semitone, which is 0.5 tone. Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that the distance between two consecutive notes is exactly one semitone. So each step is 0.5 tones, because a semitone is half a tone.\n\nWait, wait, the problem says: \"between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone.\" So each step is 1 semitone, which is 0.5 tone.\n\nSo, for example, C to C#",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given triad of musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The triad consists of exactly three notes, and we need to check their order based on the distances between them in the musical scale.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Representation**: Represent each note as an index in a predefined list of 12 notes. This helps in calculating the distance between notes.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between each pair of notes in both forward and backward directions to handle cyclic nature of the scale.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three notes and check each permutation to see if it fits the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n4. **Major Triad Check**: For a permutation to be a major triad, the distance between the first and second note should be 4 semitones, and between the second and third note should be 3 semitones.\n5. **Minor Triad Check**: For a permutation to be a minor triad, the distance between the first and second note should be 3 semitones, and between the second and third note should be 4 semitones.\n6. **Determine Result**: If any permutation satisfies the major or minor criteria, classify the triad accordingly. If none do, classify it as strange.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read the input notes\nnotes = input().split()\n\n# Define the order of the notes\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\n# Create a mapping from note to its index\nnote_indices = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\ndef get_distance(a, b):\n    # Calculate the distance from a to b (forward direction)\n    dist = (b - a) % 12\n    return dist\n\ndef is_major_permutation(notes_perm):\n    a, b, c = notes_perm\n    d1 = get_distance(note_indices[a], note_indices[b])\n    d2 = get_distance(note_indices[b], note_indices[c])\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef is_minor_permutation(notes_perm):\n    a, b, c = notes_perm\n    d1 = get_distance(note_indices[a], note_indices[b])\n    d2 = get_distance(note_indices[b], note_indices[c])\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        return True\n    return False\n\n# Generate all possible permutations of the three notes\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nall_perms = permutations(notes)\n\nresult = 'strange'\n\nfor perm in all_perms:\n    if len(perm) != 3:\n        continue\n    if is_major_permutation(perm):\n        result = 'major'\n        break\n    if is_minor_permutation(perm):\n        result = 'minor'\n        break\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution involves reading the input notes, converting them into numerical indices based on their position in the musical scale, and then generating all permutations of these notes. Each permutation is checked to see if it forms a major or minor triad by comparing the distances between consecutive notes. If any permutation fits the criteria, the result is determined; otherwise, it is classified as strange. This approach ensures that all possible configurations of the notes are considered efficiently.",
