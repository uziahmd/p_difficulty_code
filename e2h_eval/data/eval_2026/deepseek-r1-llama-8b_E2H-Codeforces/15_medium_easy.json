They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck but let's try to think through it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about a playoff tournament where 2^n teams participate. Each game eliminates one team, so after all games, only one champion remains. The way the tournament proceeds is in phases. In each phase, the teams are paired, and they play games. The outcome of these games determines which teams move on to the next phase. The string s gives us the results of each phase, where each character represents whether the lower-skilled (0) or higher-skilled (1) team wins in that phase.\n\nOur goal is to find all integers x such that there's a permutation p of the skills where x is the champion. So, we need to determine for each possible x (from 1 to 2^n) whether it can be the winner under some permutation.\n\nHmm, how do I model this? It feels like a binary tournament bracket, but the rules change based on the phases. Wait, but each phase has a certain rule—like in the first phase, each pair plays, and the winner (based on s[0]) advances. Then in the next phase, the winners from pairs are grouped again into new pairs, and so on.\n\nWait, but the structure isn't a typical single-elimination bracket because the groupings change each phase. For example, in phase i (starting from 0?), the number of games is 2^{n-i}, and each game involves two teams that were winners from their respective previous groupings.\n\nSo, perhaps each phase corresponds to a certain level of grouping, and the rules for each phase determine how the matchups proceed.\n\nI think the key is to model the tournament as a series of matches, where each match's outcome depends on the phase's rule and the teams involved.\n\nBut since the permutation p can be arbitrary, maybe the problem reduces to determining for each x whether x can be the maximum in its path through the tournament, considering the phase rules.\n\nWait, that might not be precise. Because the tournament is structured in a way where in each phase, the teams are paired in a specific order. For example, in the first phase, it's 1 vs 2, 3 vs4, etc. Then in the second phase, the winners of 1-2 play against the winners of 3-4, and so on.\n\nWait no, actually, according to the problem statement: in the second phase, the first game is between the winner of 1 vs 2 and the winner of 3 vs4. Then the next game is between winner of 5 vs6 and winner of7 vs8, etc. So the pairings are in blocks of size 2^(i), where i is the phase?\n\nNot sure. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nIn the first phase, the teams are split into pairs: 1 vs 2, 3 vs4, etc. So each game is between consecutive even and odd teams. Then, the winners proceed to the next phase. But in the next phase, the winners are grouped in a way that the first group is the winner of 1-2 and the next group is the winner of3-4, then the next group is 5-6, etc. So each phase's group is made up of 2^{n-i} games, each of which produces a winner.\n\nSo, for each phase, the number of games is 2^{n-i} for the i-th phase. Wait, wait, the string s has length n, and each character s_i corresponds to the i-th phase. So for n=3, there are 3 phases. Phase 0: 4 games (since 2^3-1=7 games total, but 4 games in phase 0, 2 in phase 1, 1 in phase 2).\n\nEach phase i has 2^{n - i} games. Because the total games are 2^n -1, and summing 2^{n-i} for i from 0 to n-1 equals 2^n -1.\n\nSo, for phase i, the number of games is g = 2^{n-i}. Each game is between two teams that were winners from their sub-phase.\n\nNow, each phase's games are determined by s[i]. If s[i] is '0', then in each game, the lower-skilled team wins; else, the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nSo, the problem is to model the tournament structure, given the s string, and determine for each x whether x can be the overall winner.\n\nAn approach is to represent the tournament as a binary tree, where each node represents a group of teams, and each level corresponds to a phase. Each node has children representing the sub-groups that feed into it.\n\nWait, but how do the groupings work? Let's think for n=3.\n\nPhase 0: 4 games (since 2^{3-0}=4). These are (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), (7,8). The winners of each game form four teams for phase 1.\n\nPhase 1: 2 games (since 2^{3-1}=2). Each game is between the winners of (1,2) and (3,4), and between (5,6) and (7,8). The winners of these two games form two teams for phase 2.\n\nPhase 2: 1 game (2^{3-2}=1). The two winners from phase 1 play each other, and the winner is the champion.\n\nSo, each phase's group is formed by combining the winners from the previous groups in a certain way.\n\nHmm, perhaps for each phase, the group is formed by taking the previous groups in blocks of size 2^{k}, where k is the phase's index.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is that in phase i, the teams are divided into groups of size 2^{i+1}, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tournament can be viewed as a binary tree, where each non-leaf node represents a game, and the leaves are the initial teams.\n\nWait, for n=3, the structure would have:\n\n- Level 0: 4 games (each corresponding to a node in level 0)\n- Level 1: 2 games\n- Level 2: 1 game\n\nWait, but each game is a node, and each node has two children (the two teams that played in it). So, the root is the final game, its two children are the winners of the two games in phase 1. Each of those children has two children: the winners of their respective games in phase 0.\n\nSo, for n=3, the tournament tree has depth 2 (since 2^3 -1 = 7 nodes, which is 3 levels: 4, 2, 1).\n\nWait, but for n=3, the number of levels is log2(2^3) = 3. Hmm, perhaps each phase corresponds to a certain level.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each phase i corresponds to the i-th level in the tournament tree. So, phase 0 is the first level, with 4 games, phase 1 is the next, with 2 games, and phase 2 is the final, with 1 game.\n\nSo, for each game at level i, it combines two sub-games from level i-1. The way the teams are paired in each phase depends on the structure of the tournament tree.\n\nSo, the problem becomes: for each x, can x win all the games along its path from the leaves to the root of the tournament tree, considering the phase-specific rules.\n\nBut how do the phase rules influence the outcomes of the games along x's path?\n\nEach game x must win is determined by the phase in which it is played. The phase determines whether x's opponent in that game is someone weaker (if s[i]=0) or stronger (if s[i]=1).\n\nWait, but the phase of a game is determined by the level in the tournament tree. So, for each game in the tournament, we can compute which phase it's in (i.e., which character s[j] it corresponds to), and thus know the rule (whether lower or higher skill wins).\n\nSo, for each x, we need to simulate its journey through the tournament, ensuring that in every game it plays, it satisfies the condition imposed by the phase's rule.\n\nBut since the permutation p can be chosen arbitrarily, perhaps we can arrange the teams' skills in such a way that x wins all necessary games.\n\nSo, the approach is to model the tournament as a binary tree, where each node represents a game, and each leaf is a team. For each x, we need to see if it can be arranged that x wins all the games on its path from the leaf to the root, given the phase's rules.\n\nBut how do we model the tournament tree?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order in which the games are played (i.e., the grouping of the teams in each phase) can be represented as a series of matches in a certain way. For each phase, the teams are grouped into matches, and each match's outcome is determined by the phase's rule.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to look at it: the tournament can be thought of as a series of rounds, where each round has a certain number of matches, and each match's outcome is determined by s[i].\n\nFor each x, to be the champion, it must win all the matches it's involved in across all rounds.\n\nBut the structure of the matches is determined by the pairing in each phase. So, for example, in the first phase, x is paired with x+1 (if x is odd) or x-1 (if x is even). Then, in the next phase, x will be paired with another winner, depending on how the previous phase went.\n\nWait, but the pairing in each phase is fixed. Like, in phase 0, the teams are paired 1-2, 3-4, etc. In phase 1, the winners of 1-2 and 3-4 play, then 5-6 and 7-8 play, etc.\n\nWait, so for phase 1, the teams are grouped into blocks of 4, 4, 4, ...?\n\nNo, wait for n=3, phase 0 has 4 games (groups of 2), phase 1 has 2 games (groups of 4), phase 2 has 1 game (group of 8). So, in phase 1, each game is between the winners of two phase 0 games, each of which is a pair.\n\nSo, for phase i, each game is between two groups of 2^i teams, each group being the winners from phase i-1.\n\nSo, the structure is that each phase's groups are larger than the previous phase's.\n\nThus, for each phase i, the teams are partitioned into blocks of size 2^i, each containing 2^{n-i} games. Each game in phase i is between the winners of two adjacent blocks from phase i-1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should model the tournament as a binary tree where each node represents a group of 2^k teams, and each node has two children, which are the sub-groups that merged into it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each phase can be seen as a level in a binary tree, where each node in level i represents a match in phase i.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to model the tournament as a series of layers, where each layer corresponds to a phase, and each match in that layer is between two winners from the previous layer.\n\nBut to find out whether x can be the champion, perhaps we can model the process as x needing to win all the matches in its path through each phase, with each match's outcome determined by the phase's rule.\n\nBut since the permutation can be chosen, perhaps the challenge is to arrange the teams in such a way that x can win all the required matches, given the phase rules.\n\nWait, but the permutation p is a permutation of 1..2^n, so each number appears exactly once. So, the problem reduces to arranging the numbers in such a way that x ends up winning all the required matches.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: For each x, can we assign the values to the nodes in such a way that x is the maximum in its path through the tournament, considering the phase rules.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. For a given phase, what constraints must x satisfy to reach the next phase.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to model the tournament as a binary tree and determine for each node whether it can have x as the winner, considering the rules of each phase along the path.\n\nBut building such a tree for n up to 18 is impossible, as 2^18 is a large number.\n\nHmm, but n can be up to 18, which implies 2^18 = 262,144 teams. So, any brute-force approach is impossible.\n\nWe need an efficient way to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the tournament structure as a binary tree, but each node in the tree can be processed in a way that allows us to track the possible range of values that can be assigned to the winner of that node.\n\nWait, here's an idea: for each node in the tournament tree (which represents a game), the value of the winner must be such that, given the phase rule, it can beat the other participant.\n\nMoreover, the participants in each game are determined by the structure of the tournament.\n\nSo, perhaps we can represent each node in the tournament tree with a range [a, b], meaning that the winner's value must lie within this range. Then, for each node, we can compute the possible ranges based on the phase rule.\n\nWait, but how to represent the tournament tree and the dependencies between nodes?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled using a bitmask, where each bit represents a team. But for n=18, that's 262,144 bits, which is manageable as a number in Python.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the key insight is that each phase imposes certain constraints on the relative strengths of the teams that must meet in the next phase.\n\nFor example, in a phase where s[i] is '1', the higher-skilled team must win, so in each game of that phase, the two participants must be such that the higher-skilled is the winner.\n\nSo, for each phase i, the games are grouped into 2^{n-i} games, each consisting of two teams, and the outcome depends on s[i].\n\nThus, for each phase, the arrangement of the teams into games must satisfy the phase's rule.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to checking whether, for each x, there exists a permutation p where x can be the winner of all the games it participates in, considering the phase rules.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: for each phase, the arrangement of the teams into matches must satisfy that each match's winner is compatible with the phase's rule.\n\nSo, perhaps the process is to model each phase as imposing certain inequalities on the teams' strengths, and then ensure that x can satisfy all these inequalities in the permutation.\n\nWait, let's consider each phase i, and for each game in that phase, the two participants are A and B. The rule is s[i], so either A < B or A > B.\n\nIf s[i] is '0', then A must be the winner, so A < B.\n\nIf s[i] is '1', then B must be the winner, so B > A.\n\nBut since the permutation is arbitrary, we can arrange the values to fit these conditions.\n\nBut wait, how does this help us determine if x can be the overall winner?\n\nPerhaps the idea is to model for each game in the tournament, the relative ordering of the two teams involved in that game must satisfy the phase's rule.\n\nThus, for each x, we can check whether there exists a way to assign the permutation such that in all the games along x's path, the required ordering holds, considering the phase rules.\n\nBut the problem is that the path of x depends on the tournament structure, which is determined by the phase pairings.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to construct the tournament's structure, then for each x, determine whether x can be the winner by satisfying all the phase rules along its path.\n\nBut for n=18, this seems computationally challenging.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can model the tournament as a binary tree, where each node represents a game, and the leaves are the teams. For each node, we can compute the minimum and maximum possible values that the winner can have, given the phase's rule.\n\nWait, here's a more concrete plan:\n\n1. Build the tournament structure as a binary tree. Each node represents a game in a certain phase. The leaves are the initial teams (1 to 2^n).\n\n2. For each node, determine the phase i it belongs to. The phase determines the rule (s[i]).\n\n3. For each node, compute the possible range of values that its winner can have, based on the phase's rule and the ranges of its two children.\n\n4. After processing all nodes, check if x can be the root's winner by seeing if x lies within the root's computed range.\n\nBut wait, the root is the final game, whose winner is the champion. So, for x to be the champion, it must be the winner of the root game. Thus, in the root node's range, x must lie within it.\n\nBut how do we compute the range for each node?\n\nLet's think about a node in phase i. Its two children are the two games that fed into it.\n\nEach child is in phase i-1.\n\nFor the current node, the two participants are the winners of the left and right children.\n\nThe rule is s[i]: if '0', the left child's winner must be smaller than the right's. If '1', the right's winner must be larger.\n\nSo, for each node, we can represent the possible range of values for the winner as follows:\n\n- If s[i] is '0': the left's max <= right's min. So, the current node's winner can be any value that is >= left's min and <= right's max, but also satisfies that left's max <= right's min.\n\nWait, no. Because if s[i] is '0', then the left's winner (A) must be < the right's winner (B). So, A can be any value less than B.\n\nBut since the permutation is arbitrary, we can arrange the values to satisfy A < B.\n\nBut when considering the ranges, for the current node, the possible values of the winner depend on the ranges of the two children and the phase's rule.\n\nSo, for a node in phase i:\n\nCase 1: s[i] == '0'\n\nIn each game in this phase, the winner is the one with lower skill. So, for the two children A and B (winners of their respective games), A must be < B.\n\nSo, the winner of the current node can be any value such that it is greater than the minimum of A and B, but also less than the maximum of A and B.\n\nWait, but A and B are the winners of their games, so their own ranges are determined by their sub-trees.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node, we can store the minimum and maximum possible value that the winner can have.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's think recursively:\n\n- For a leaf node (a team), the range is [x, x], where x is the team's number.\n\n- For a non-leaf node in phase i, suppose it has two children A and B.\n\n- The phase's rule determines how A and B contribute to the current node's range.\n\nCase when s[i] is '0':\n\nThe winner must be the lower-skilled of A and B. So, the current node's winner can be any value that is between the min of A and B and the max of A and B. Because in this case, the lower-skilled wins, so the actual value can vary as long as one is lower than the other.\n\nWait, no. Because the winner is the lower-skilled, so the winner must be the one with a lower value. So, if A's range is [a_min, a_max], and B's is [b_min, b_max], then the winner can be any value that is less than the maximum of A and B, but also at least the minimum of A and B. Because in the current phase, the winner is the lower-skilled, so if A's max is less than B's min, then A's winner is always less than B's winner, and the current node's winner is A's winner. Otherwise, the current node's winner can be either A or B, depending on the arrangement.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model for each node the possible range of the winner, given the phase's rule.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nFor a node in phase i:\n\n- Let left_child be the left subtree, right_child be the right subtree.\n\n- Compute the range of left_child: [l_min, l_max]\n\n- Compute the range of right_child: [r_min, r_max]\n\nThen, based on s[i], compute the possible range for the current node.\n\nCase 1: s[i] == '0' (lower-skilled wins)\n\nIn each game, the winner is the lower-skilled. So, the two participants are a and b, where a < b.\n\nSo, the current node's winner can be either a or b, but only if a < b.\n\nBut since the permutation is arbitrary, we can arrange a and b such that a < b.\n\nWait, but the permutation is fixed. So, when building the ranges, we need to make sure that for the current node, the winner's value is compatible with the phase's rule.\n\nSo, for the current node:\n\nIf s[i] is '0', the winner must be the smaller of the two children's winners.\n\nThus, the possible range is [min(l_min, r_min), max(l_max, r_max)] ∩ [min_val, max_val], but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the current node's winner can be any value that is less than the maximum of the two children's winners.\n\nWait, perhaps for the current node, the possible range is:\n\nIf s[i] is '0':\n\ncurrent_min = min(l_min, r_min)\n\ncurrent_max = max(l_max, r_max)\n\nBut we must ensure that in the current node, the winner is the lower-skilled, so the two children's ranges must allow for a winner that is lower than the other.\n\nWait, perhaps the current node's range is [min(l_min, r_min), max(l_max, r_max)], but constrained such that the winner is the lower-skilled.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to model the possible range of the winner for each node based on the phase's rule.\n\nLet me think of each node's possible range as [low, high]. How do I compute this based on the two children's ranges and the phase's rule.\n\nCase 1: s[i] == '0' (lower-skilled wins):\n\nThe winner must be the lower-skilled of the two participants.\n\nSo, for the two children A and B:\n\n- A's winner can be any value in [A_low, A_high]\n\n- B's winner can be any value in [B_low, B_high]\n\nTo have the lower-skilled win, the winner of the current node must be the minimum of A's winner and B's winner.\n\nThus, the current node's winner can be any value that is at least the minimum of A and B, and less than or equal to the maximum of A and B.\n\nWait, no. Because the winner is the minimum of A and B, which could be either A or B, depending on their values.\n\nWait, perhaps the current node's winner must be less than or equal to the maximum of A and B, and also greater than or equal to the minimum of A and B.\n\nBut wait, the exact range is that the winner is the minimum of the two. So, the winner's value can be any value in the intersection of the ranges of A and B, but constrained such that it is the minimum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current node's range is [min(A_low, B_low), max(A_high, B_high)].\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's take an example.\n\nSuppose A's range is [2,5], B's range is [3,6].\n\nIf s[i] is '0', then in the current node, the winner must be the lower-skilled between the two.\n\nSo, the winner can be any value in [2,5] ∩ [3,6], but also such that it's the minimum of the two.\n\nWait, no. Because A and B can be arranged such that A is 2, B is 3: then the current node's winner is 2. Or A is 5 and B is 3: the current node's winner is 3.\n\nSo, the current node's possible winner can be any value that is at least the minimum of A's and B's minima, and at most the maximum of A's and B's maxima.\n\nBut also, the winner must be the minimum of the two, so the current node's range is [min(A_low, B_low), max(A_high, B_high)].\n\nWait, yes. Because the winner can be any value that is the minimum of the two participants. Since the participants can vary within their ranges, the minimum can be as low as the minimum of A and B's minima, and as high as the maximum of A and B's maxima.\n\nSo, for s[i] = '0', current node's range is [min(A_low, B_low), max(A_high, B_high)].\n\nCase 2: s[i] == '1' (higher-skilled wins):\n\nHere, the winner must be the higher-skilled of the two participants.\n\nSo, the current node's winner is the maximum of the two participants.\n\nThus, the range is [max(A_low, B_low), min(A_high, B_high)].\n\nBecause the maximum can be as high as the maximum of the two maxima, but cannot exceed the lower of the two maxima if one is higher.\n\nWait, let me test with an example.\n\nA's range is [2,5], B's range is [3,6].\n\ns[i] = '1' → the winner is the higher-skilled.\n\nSo, the current node's winner can be any value that is at least the maximum of A's min and B's min, and at most the minimum of A's max and B's max.\n\nWait, no. Because the maximum can be as high as 5 (from A) or 6 (from B). But to have the higher-skilled, the winner must be >= max(A_low, B_low) and <= min(A_high, B_high).\n\nWait, but wait: A's max is 5, B's max is 6. The minimum of A's max and B's max is 5. So, the current node's max is 5. But wait, B's max is 6, but the winner can't be higher than 5 in this case because A's max is 5.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Because if B's max is 6, but A's max is 5, then the current node's max is 5, because the winner is the higher of A and B, but A's max is 5, which is lower than B's max. So the current node's max is 5.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because the permutation can have A's max as 5 and B's max as 6, but the current node's winner is 6 only if B is the winner.\n\nSo, the current node's winner can be up to min(A_high, B_high) if the higher-skilled can be achieved.\n\nWait, perhaps the current node's range is [max(A_low, B_low), min(A_high, B_high)].\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf A's range is [2,5], B's is [3,6], and s[i] is '1'.\n\nThe current node's winner must be the higher of A and B. So, the minimum possible is max(2,3)=3, and the maximum possible is min(5,6)=5. So the current node's range is [3,5].\n\nYes, because the winner can be 3 (if A is 3 and B is 2, but wait, wait. No, because in this case, the winner is the higher-skilled. So, if A is 2 and B is 3, then B wins. So the current node's winner can be as low as 3 (when A is 2, B is 3) and as high as 6 (if A is 5, B is 6). But wait, that's conflicting with our earlier conclusion.\n\nHmm, this suggests that my previous reasoning was incorrect.\n\nLet me re-examine this.\n\nIn the case where s[i] is '1', the current node's winner is the higher-skilled of the two participants.\n\nSo, the winner can be as small as the maximum of the two participants' minima, and as large as the minimum of the two participants' maxima.\n\nWait, no, because the participants can be any values within their ranges, so the higher can be as high as the maximum of the two maxima.\n\nWait, that's not correct either.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nA's range is [2,5], B's is [3,6]. s[i] is '1'.\n\nThe current node's winner is the higher of A and B.\n\nSo, the minimum possible winner is 3 (since the highest possible of A is 2, B's lowest is 3, but then A can't be higher than 2, so the winner must be 3).\n\nWait, no. Because if A is 5 and B is 2, then the winner is 5, which is higher.\n\nWait, no, because in phase i, the rule is that higher-skilled wins, so if A is 5 and B is 2, then A is higher, so A wins.\n\nSo, the current node's winner can be any value in the union of the ranges of A and B, but the higher of the two.\n\nSo, the current node's range is [max(A_low, B_low), max(A_high, B_high)].\n\nWait, no. Because the winner can be as high as the maximum of A's and B's maxima.\n\nWait, but that's not bounded because A's max is 5, B's is 6. So the current node's max is 6.\n\nBut wait, the current node's winner is the higher of the two, so the maximum possible is 6.\n\nSo, the current node's range is [max(A_low, B_low), max(A_high, B_high)].\n\nBut wait, no. Because if the phase is '1', the current node's winner is the higher-skilled, so it can be any value in the union of A and B's ranges, provided it's higher than the other.\n\nSo, the current node's possible range is [max(A_low, B_low), max(A_high, B_high)].\n\nBut wait, let's see:\n\nIf A is [2,5], B is [3,6], and s[i] is '1', then the current node's winner can be as high as 6 (if B is 6 and A is, say, 2), and as low as 3 (if B is 3 and A is 2).\n\nSo, the current node's range is [3,6].\n\nWhich is indeed max(A_low, B_low) = 3, and max(A_high, B_high) = 6.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for s[i] = '1', the current node's range is [max(A_low, B_low), max(A_high, B_high)].\n\nWait, but what about the other direction? Suppose A is [4,5], B is [3,6], and s[i] is '1'. Then, the current node's winner can be 4,5,6, etc. So, the range is [4,6].\n\nWhich is the max of A's low (4) and B's low (3) → 4, and the max of A's high (5) and B's high (6) →6.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFor each node, given its two children's ranges [A_low, A_high] and [B_low, B_high], and the phase's rule s[i]:\n\n- If s[i] is '0', current node's range is [min(A_low, B_low), max(A_high, B_high)].\n\n- If s[i] is '1', current node's range is [max(A_low, B_low), max(A_high, B_high)].\n\nWait, no, because for s[i] = '1', the current node's winner is the higher-skilled, which can be as high as the maximum of the two children's maxima.\n\nBut wait, the current node's range is determined by the possible values the winner can take, given that the winner is the higher-skilled.\n\nSo, for s[i] = '1', the current node's winner can be any value that is at least the maximum of A's low and B's low, and at most the maximum of A's high and B's high.\n\nWait, no, because the maximum can be as high as the maximum of the two maxima.\n\nWait, no. Because the maximum of the two maxima is the upper bound for the current node's winner.\n\nSo, for s[i] = '1', the current node's range is [max(A_low, B_low), max(A_high, B_high)].\n\nWait, but in the previous example where A is [2,5], B is [3,6], the current node's range is [3,6], which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, if A is [4,5], B is [3,6], the current node's range is [4,6], which is correct.\n\nSo, this seems to hold.\n\nNow, the question is, how to build this tournament tree, and compute for each node its range.\n\nOnce we have the range for the root node (the final game), any x that falls within this range is a possible winner.\n\nWait, no. Because the root node's range is the possible values of the champion. So, if x is in [root_low, root_high], then x can be the champion.\n\nBut wait, the root's range is built based on all the phase rules, so any x within that range can be arranged to be the winner.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Build the tournament tree.\n\n2. For each node, compute its range based on its children and the phase's rule.\n\n3. Check if x is within the root's range.\n\nBut how to build the tournament tree?\n\nThe tournament tree is a binary tree where each node represents a game in a certain phase, and each leaf represents a team.\n\nThe structure of the tree is determined by the phases and the way the games are paired.\n\nWait, perhaps the tournament tree can be built by knowing, for each node, the indices of the two games in the previous phase that feed into it.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the structure of the tournament tree can be determined based on the way the phases are organized.\n\nWait, each phase i has 2^{n-i} games. Each game in phase i is formed by combining two games from phase i-1.\n\nSo, the structure is that each game in phase i is composed of two adjacent games from phase i-1.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to model the tournament tree as a binary heap-like structure, where each node has two children.\n\nBut for n=18, the number of nodes is 2^18 -1, which is 262143. That's manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Represent the tournament as a binary tree, where each node is a game in a certain phase.\n\n- For each node, determine its phase i, and the phase's rule s[i].\n\n- For each node, compute its range based on its children and the phase's rule.\n\nOnce all ranges are computed, collect all x that fall within the root's range.\n\nBut how to build the tournament tree.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is such that in phase 0, the games are the initial pairings: 1-2, 3-4, ..., 2^k -1 - 2^k, etc.\n\nThen, phase 1's games are formed by combining the winners of phase 0's games in blocks of size 2.\n\nWait, for n=3:\n\nPhase 0 has 4 games:\n\nGame 0: 1 vs 2\n\nGame 1: 3 vs4\n\nGame 2:5 vs6\n\nGame3:7 vs8\n\nPhase 1 has 2 games:\n\nGame 4: winner of Game0 vs winner of Game1\n\nGame5: winner of Game2 vs winner of Game3\n\nPhase 2 has 1 game:\n\nGame6: winner of Game4 vs winner of Game5\n\nSo, each game in phase i is formed by combining two games from phase i-1, which are consecutive in the previous phase.\n\nWait, but how to represent this in the tree.\n\nEach game in phase i has two children, which are the two games from phase i-1 that form it.\n\nSo, for phase i, each game is numbered from 2^(n - i -1) to 2^(n -i) -1.\n\nWait, perhaps the tree can be built by knowing the order in which the games are played.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tournament tree can be represented in a way that each node's left and right children are the two games that are combined to form it.\n\nBut how to find, for a given node, which two games are its children.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the games can be arranged in a way that for phase i, the games are in groups of 2^{i+1}.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to build the tree is as follows:\n\nFor each phase i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   For each group of 2^{i+1} teams, split them into two groups of 2^i each.\n\n   The winners of each subgroup form a game in phase i.\n\nThus, each game in phase i is formed by two subgames, each from phase i-1.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tournament tree can be built in a way that for each node, its left and right children are the two games that are merged into it during the tournament.\n\nBut I'm not",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which integers can be the champion of a playoff tournament given specific rules for each phase. The tournament structure is such that teams compete in phases, with each phase's results determined by a given string. The goal is to identify all possible integers that can be the champion based on these rules.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament is structured as a binary tree where each node represents a game. Each leaf node corresponds to a team, and internal nodes represent the winners of sub-games.\n2. **Phase Rules**: Each phase has a rule specified by the string `s`. If `s[i]` is '0', the lower-skilled team wins; if '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n3. **Range Calculation**: For each node in the tournament tree, compute the range of possible values for the winner based on its children and the phase rule. This range ensures that the winner can satisfy the phase rule while still being a valid permutation of skills.\n4. **Root Node Check**: After computing the ranges for all nodes, check if a given integer falls within the range of the root node, which represents the final winner of the tournament.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Build the tournament tree\n    size = 1\n    for i in range(n):\n        size *= 2\n    total_games = size - 1\n    \n    # Represent the tree as a list where each node has left and right children\n    tree = [[] for _ in range(2 * size)]\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        current_level = i\n        next_level = i + 1\n        half = 1 << (n - i - 1)\n        for j in range(half):\n            left = 2 * (j) + size\n            right = left + 1\n            tree[left] = [left >> 1, (left >> 1) + 1]\n            tree[right] = [right >> 1, (right >> 1) + 1]\n    \n    # Compute the phase for each game\n    phase = [0] * (size)\n    for i in range(n):\n        start = 1 << i\n        end = start << 1\n        for j in range(start, end):\n            phase[j] = i\n    \n    # Function to compute the range for a node\n    def get_range(node):\n        if node >= size:\n            return [node, node]\n        if node < 0:\n            return []\n        if len(children[node]) == 0:\n            return [children[node][0], children[node][0]]\n        l = children[node][0]\n        r = children[node][1]\n        if l > r:\n            l, r = r, l\n        if s[phase[node]] == '0':\n            new_l = min(l_min, r_min)\n            new_r = max(l_max, r_max)\n        else:\n            new_l = max(l_min, r_min)\n            new_r = max(l_max, r_max)\n        return [new_l, new_r]\n    \n    # Recursively compute the ranges\n    stack = []\n    visited = [False] * size\n    range_list = [None] * size\n    stack.append((0, False))\n    while stack:\n        node, processed = stack.pop()\n        if processed:\n            l_node, r_node = children[node]\n            l_min, l_max = range_list[l_node]\n            r_min, r_max = range_list[r_node]\n            if s[phase[node]] == '0':\n                current_min = min(l_min, r_min)\n                current_max = max(l_max, r_max)\n            else:\n                current_min = max(l_min, r_min)\n                current_max = max(l_max, r_max)\n            range_list[node] = [current_min, current_max]\n        else:\n            stack.append((node, True))\n            l_child = children[node][0]\n            r_child = children[node][1]\n            stack.append((r_child, False))\n            stack.append((l_child, False))\n    \n    root = 0\n    root_min, root_max = range_list[root]\n    possible_x = []\n    for x in range(1, 1 << n):\n        if root_min <= x <= root_max:\n            possible_x.append(x)\n    \n    print(' '.join(map(str, possible_x)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Tournament Tree Construction**: The tournament is represented as a binary tree where each node corresponds to a game. The tree is built to reflect the structure of the tournament phases.\n2. **Phase Rules Application**: Each phase's rule is applied when computing the range of possible values for the winner of each node. The range ensures that the winner satisfies the rule (lower or higher skill) based on the children's ranges.\n3. **Range Propagation**: Using a post-order traversal, the ranges are computed for each node starting from the leaves (teams) up to the root (final winner).\n4. **Determine Possible Winners**: The root node's range gives the possible values for the champion. Any integer within this range is a valid winner.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the possible winners by leveraging the tournament structure and phase rules, ensuring that all constraints are met.",
