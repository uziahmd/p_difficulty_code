Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the number of valid Morse code substrings after each step of building a string S. Hmm, let's try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that each Morse code letter is represented by a string of 1-4 characters, consisting of 0s and 1s. But not all possible combinations are valid. There are four invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So any substring in S that corresponds exactly to one of these four shouldn't be counted as a valid English letter.\n\nWait, but the problem isn't just about counting valid letters. It's about counting all possible non-empty substrings that represent some valid letter. So for each position in S, I need to look at all possible substrings starting or ending there and check if they form a valid Morse code.\n\nBut considering that m can be up to 3000, a naive approach of checking every possible substring each time would be way too slow. I need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Maybe I can track for each position in S, the number of valid substrings ending at that position. That sounds promising.\n\nSo, for each new character added to S, I'll look back a few steps (up to 4 steps before) because Morse codes can be up to 4 characters long. For each possible length from 1 to 4, I'll check if the substring is a valid Morse code. If it is, I add the count from the previous step (if applicable) to my current total.\n\nWait, no. Because when adding a new character, the new possible substrings end at this character. So for each position i, I can consider all substrings ending at i with lengths 1,2,3,4, provided that i has enough preceding characters.\n\nFor example, if i is the current index, then the substrings ending here could be of length 1 (just the current character), 2 (current and previous), 3 (current, previous two), 4 (current, three before, four before). For each of these lengths, I need to check whether the substring is a valid Morse code.\n\nIf it is, then I can add the sum of the counts for the substrings that can form it. Wait, maybe not the sum but how?\n\nAlternatively, for each position i, I can keep track of the number of valid substrings ending at i of each possible length (1,2,3,4). Then, for each new character, I can compute these based on the previous state.\n\nHmm, perhaps a DP array where dp[i][l] represents the number of valid substrings ending at position i with length l. Since l can be up to 4, this seems manageable.\n\nLet me structure it:\n\n- Initialize an array dp where each element is a list of size 5 (lengths 1-4), initialized to 0.\n- For each new character c:\n   - For l in 1 to 4:\n      - If i >= l-1 (since we need l-1 previous characters):\n          - Check if the substring ending at i with length l is a valid Morse code.\n          - If yes, then dp[i][l] = dp[i-1][l-1] + 1?\n          - Wait, not exactly. Because the substring itself could be a new valid code, contributing 1, and if the previous part was also valid, it adds to the count.\n\nNo, maybe it's better to think recursively. For a substring of length l ending at i, if the last character is c, then the substring is either a new code (just c), or a longer code formed by appending c to a valid substring of length l-1 that ended at i-1.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So for each position i, and for each possible length l, we can compute dp[i][l] as follows:\n\n- If the substring s[i-l+1..i] is a valid Morse code, then dp[i][l] = dp[i-1][l-1] + 1.\n- Otherwise, dp[i][l] remains 0.\n\nWait, no. Because even if the substring is not a valid code, the previous part may still contribute to other substrings. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAnother approach: for each new character, we can consider all possible substrings that end with this character. Each such substring is a candidate for being a valid Morse code. We need to find all such substrings and count them.\n\nBut checking all possible substrings each time is O(m*4), which is acceptable for m=3000. Let's see:\n\nEach new character can form up to 4 new substrings (of lengths 1,2,3,4). For each of these substrings, we need to check if it's a valid Morse code. If",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of valid Morse code substrings after each modification to a string S. Each modification appends either a dot ('0') or a dash ('1') to S. A valid Morse code substring corresponds to a unique English letter, excluding four specific invalid strings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP array where `dp[i][l]` represents the number of valid Morse code substrings ending at position `i` with length `l`.\n2. **Modulo Operation**: Since the results can be large, we take results modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n3. **Check Validity**: For each new character added, check all possible substrings ending at this character of lengths 1 to 4. If a substring is valid (i.e., it does not match any of the four invalid strings), update the DP array accordingly.\n4. **Efficient Updates**: For each new character, compute the number of valid substrings by considering substrings of increasing lengths and updating the DP state based on previous results.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n# Precompute valid codes\nvalid_codes = {\n    '0': {'0', '00', '000', '0000'},\n    '1': {'1', '11', '111', '1111'}\n}\n\n# Invalid codes\ninvalid = {'0011', '0101', '1110', '1111'}\n\nm = int(input())\ns = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    c = input().strip()\n    s.append(c)\n\n# Initialize DP: dp[i][l] is the count for position i, length l\ndp = [[0] * 5 for _ in range(len(s))]\ntotal = [0] * len(s)\nfor i in range(len(s)):\n    current = s[i]\n    # Check all possible lengths from 1 to 4\n    for l in range(1, 5):\n        if i >= l - 1:\n            substr = s[i - l + 1:i + 1]\n            if substr in valid_codes.get(current, set()):\n                # Check if the substring is valid\n                if substr not in invalid:\n                    if l == 1:\n                        dp[i][l] = 1\n                    else:\n                        if i - l >= 0:\n                            dp[i][l] = dp[i - l][l - 1]\n                        dp[i][l] += 1\n                    dp[i][l] %= MOD\n            else:\n                dp[i][l] = 0\n        else:\n            dp[i][l] = 0\n    # Calculate total up to this point\n    total_i = 0\n    for l in range(1, 5):\n        if dp[i][l]:\n            total_i += dp[i][l]\n    total_i %= MOD\n    total[i] = total_i\n\n# Now output the totals\nfor i in range(len(s)):\n    print(total[i])\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We initialize a DP array where each entry `dp[i][l]` keeps track of valid substrings ending at position `i` with length `l`.\n- **Valid Substrings Check**: For each new character, we check all possible substrings ending at this character of lengths 1 to 4. If a substring is valid, we update the DP array.\n- **Efficient Updates**: By using dynamic programming, we efficiently update the count of valid substrings without rechecking previously known states, ensuring the solution remains efficient even for the upper constraint of `m = 3000`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count valid Morse code substrings after each modification to the string S, providing the required results in an optimal manner.",
