Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Hmm, let's see. The problem says that two boots are compatible if their colors are the same or one is a question mark. Oh right, because the question mark is compatible with any color.\n\nSo, the input gives me two strings, l and r, each of length n. Each character in these strings represents a color for a left or right boot respectively. My goal is to pair each left boot with a right boot such that the pair is compatible, and each boot can be in at most one pair. And I have to maximize the number of such pairs.\n\nWait, but how do I approach this? Let me think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to count all possible compatible pairs and then figure out the maximum matching. But since each left can only be paired once, and each right as well, it's more like a bipartite graph matching problem. But with n up to 150,000, a standard maximum bipartite matching algorithm like Hopcroft-Karp would be too slow because its time complexity is O(E√V), and E could be up to n^2, which is way too big.\n\nSo, I need a smarter approach. Maybe I can model this as a bipartite graph but find a way to compute the maximum matching efficiently without enumerating all possible edges.\n\nWait, perhaps I can precompute for each possible color (including '?') the counts on the left and right sides. Then, for each color, calculate how many possible pairs can be formed, considering that some left and right boots are already used.\n\nBut no, that might not directly give the maximum matching because some overlaps can occur. For example, using a certain color for some pairs might block others.\n\nHmm. Another thought: since the '?' is compatible with everything, maybe we can first handle all the '?' cases and then deal with specific color matches.\n\nLet me break it down into steps:\n\n1. Count the number of left '?' and right '?'.\n   - The maximum possible pairs from these is min(left_q, right_q). We can take as many as possible here. Because each '?' can pair with any other, including other '?'s.\n   - Also, for each specific color c, the number of left c's and right c's can be added together, but again, ensuring that each is used only once.\n\nWait, but how to combine these. Maybe the '?'s can be considered as a flexible resource that can be used to pair with any available left or right boot.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal solution is to first pair as many specific color pairs as possible, and then use the remaining '?'s to pair the leftovers.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think differently.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a bipartite graph where each left node is connected to all right nodes it can form a compatible pair with. Then, the maximum matching is what we're looking for. But with n up to 150,000, building the adjacency list is impossible due to memory constraints.\n\nSo, I need a way to represent this graph implicitly without storing all edges.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps I can group the left and right nodes by their colors and calculate how many can be matched between those groups.\n\nWait, yes! Because for each color c, any left boot with color c can pair with any right boot with color c. Additionally, any left boot with color '?' can pair with any right boot, and any right boot with color '?' can pair with any left.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be broken down into:\n\n- Calculate the number of pairs where both are '?', then for each specific color, the minimum of left count and right count, and then handle the cross between specific and '?.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because when you have a specific color, say 'a', and some left and right 'a's, those can pair among themselves. But also, the left 'a's can pair with right '?', and vice versa.\n\nBut the order in which you process these can affect the total number of pairs.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Let me think about how to model this.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- left_counts[c]: the number of left boots with color c.\n- right_counts[c]: the number of right boots with color c.\n\nAlso, left_q = number of left boots with '?'\nright_q = number of right boots with '?'\n\nNow, the maximum possible pairs is the sum of all possible compatible pairs, but subject to each boot being used at most once.\n\nWait, but it's not just a matter of adding up the possible pairs for each color. Because some left and right boots may overlap.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to:\n\n1. Pair as many specific color pairs as possible (i.e., left and right with the same color).\n2. Then, pair the remaining left and right boots with '?', using as much as possible.\n\nWait, but that might not be optimal",

We first pair as many specific color matches as possible. Then, we use the question marks to form additional pairs with any remaining boots. This approach ensures that we maximize the number of compatible pairs efficiently. The code reads the input, processes the colors, and then constructs the result by pairing compatible boots, ensuring each boot is used at most once.",
