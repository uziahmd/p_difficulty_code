He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether it's a prefix or a suffix of the original string. The output should be a string where each character is either 'P' or 'S' indicating the classification of each input string.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. The key here is that each string of length k (from 1 to n-1) appears exactly twice in the input—once as a prefix and once as a suffix of the original string. But wait, no, actually, for each k, there are two strings: one that is a prefix of some possible s and another that is a suffix. Or maybe both are prefixes and suffixes but in different possible s strings. Wait, but Ivan says that the given set corresponds to all the prefixes and suffixes of s, which is unique. So each k-length string is either a prefix or a suffix.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that Ivan has provided all the improper prefixes and suffixes, but he hasn't told us which are which. So the input consists of 2n-2 strings, each of length from 1 to n-1, with exactly two strings for each length. These are the possible prefixes and suffixes, but we don't know which are prefixes and which are suffixes. Our task is to assign each string to P or S such that there exists at least one string s of length n whose prefixes and suffixes match this assignment.\n\nSo the approach is to find a possible s that fits the assignment.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nAnother way: For each possible string s of length n, check whether the given strings can be partitioned into prefixes and suffixes according to s. If such an s exists, then the output would be the correct P/S assignment.\n\nBut since n can be up to 100, trying all possible strings is impossible because 26^100 is way too big. So that approach isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: Since each string is either a prefix or a suffix, perhaps the correct s must start with all the prefixes and end with all the suffixes. Wait, but that might not directly help.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible s. For each possible string s, the prefixes are the first k characters for k=1 to n-1. The suffixes are the last k characters for k=1 to n-1. So for each string in the input, it must be either a prefix of s or a suffix of s. But how can we find s such that this condition holds?\n\nWait, but the input gives us all the possible candidates for prefixes and suffixes. So for each possible s, the prefixes are a subset of the input, and the suffixes are another subset.\n\nBut again, enumerating all possible s is impractical.\n\nHmm, maybe we can model the possible s by considering the constraints from the input strings. Let's consider that the first character of s is fixed as the first character of a certain string, say, a certain prefix. Then, the next character would be the second character of the same prefix, and so on.\n\nWait, but the input includes multiple strings of the same length. For example, for length 1, there are two strings. One must be the prefix, the other the suffix. Similarly for each k.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct s can be built by choosing, for each position, the character that is consistent across all possible options.\n\nWait, let's think about the first character of s. It must be the same as every possible prefix of length 1. Because any s starts with that character. So among the two strings of length 1 in the input, one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. But the prefix's first character is the first character of s. So both of the length 1 strings must have their first character equal to s[0]. So both length 1 strings must be either the same as each other. Because one is the prefix (s[0]) and the other is the suffix (also s[-1], but of length 1). Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. Because the suffix of length 1 is s[-1], which could be different from the prefix of length 1.\n\nWait, no, wait. For example, if s is \"ababa\", the prefix of length 1 is 'a', and the suffix of length 1 is 'a'. So in the input, the two length 1 strings would both be 'a'. But suppose s is \"aabba\", then the prefix of length 1 is 'a', and the suffix of length 1 is 'a' as well. So for the length 1 case, the two strings in the input must be equal. Because the prefix is s[0] and the suffix is s[-1]. So if they're different, then s can't have both as its prefix and suffix. But wait, that's not possible because for s, the prefix of length 1 is s[0], the suffix is s[-1], which can be different.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is guaranteed to correspond to some s. So for each k, the two strings of length k are either both prefixes, both suffixes, or one is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nWait, no. The problem statement says that the input is exactly 2n-2 strings, consisting of all the prefixes and suffixes of s. So for each k from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings in the input, each of length k, which are either prefixes or suffixes. So for example, for k=1, there are two strings, each of length 1. One is a prefix of s, the other is a suffix of s. So those two may or may not be the same.\n\nWait, for example, in the third sample input:\n\nInput:\n2\na\nc\n\nThe two strings are 'a' and 'c'. So s could be 'ac' (prefix 'a', suffix 'c') or 'ca' (prefix 'c', suffix 'a'). So the output would be 'SP' (for 'a' being prefix, 'c' being suffix) or 'PS' (if 'c' is prefix, 'a' is suffix).\n\nSo for length 1, the two strings can be different.\n\nHmm, okay, so back to the problem. We need to find for each string in the input whether it is a prefix or a suffix of some s, such that all the given strings are exactly the prefixes and suffixes of s.\n\nBut the problem is that we don't know what s is. So perhaps we can find s by building it step by step.\n\nAn approach could be:\n\n1. For each possible candidate s (but that's impossible for n=100), but maybe we can find s by using the given strings.\n\nWait, but perhaps s can be determined by looking for the longest common prefix and suffix.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for each possible s, the prefixes are the first k characters, and the suffixes are the last k characters. So for each possible s, the prefixes and suffixes would form two sets of strings, each of size n-1.\n\nBut since we don't know s, perhaps we can reconstruct s based on the given strings.\n\nAnother approach is to realize that for each k, exactly one of the two strings of length k is a prefix, and the other is a suffix. So for each k, among the two strings, one is part of the prefix chain and the other is part of the suffix chain.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct s can be built by determining the order of the prefixes and the order of the suffixes.\n\nWait, for the prefixes, they form a chain: each prefix of length k+1 starts with the prefix of length k. Similarly, the suffixes form a chain where each suffix of length k+1 ends with the suffix of length k.\n\nSo, for the prefixes, the string of length k must be the prefix of the string of length k+1. So for all k from 1 to n-2, the two strings of length k must be compatible with the two strings of length k+1.\n\nWait, perhaps the prefixes can be ordered in a way that each longer prefix starts with the shorter ones. Similarly for the suffixes.\n\nSo, let's try to group the input strings by their lengths. For each k, there are two strings. For each k, one will be a prefix and the other a suffix.\n\nBut how do we decide which is which? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct s can be constructed by taking the maximum possible prefix chain and the maximum possible suffix chain.\n\nWait, perhaps we can collect all possible candidates for s by combining the possible prefix chains and suffix chains.\n\nFor example, for each possible way to choose a prefix chain (each step adding a character to the end), and a suffix chain (each step adding a character to the beginning), and see if the combined string is consistent.\n\nBut even that seems computationally expensive, especially for n=100.\n\nWait, but for each k, the two strings of length k must be either a prefix or a suffix. So for k=1, the two strings are the first and last character of s. So s[0] is one of them, and s[-1] is the other.\n\nWait, no. Because for k=1, the two strings could be any of the two options: one is the prefix (s[0]), the other is the suffix (s[-1]). So the two strings for k=1 can be in any order.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. Find all possible combinations of which string is the prefix and which is the suffix for each k.\n\nBut wait, for k=1, there are two possibilities: either the first string is the prefix and the second is the suffix, or vice versa.\n\nSimilarly, for each k, there are two possibilities.\n\nThis leads to a combinatorial explosion, but perhaps we can manage it.\n\nBut for n=100, the number of possibilities is 2^(n-1), which is way too big.\n\nSo that approach isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's construct s step by step.\n\nLet's assume that s is built as follows:\n\n- The first character is determined by the k=1 prefixes and suffixes.\n\nWait, but for k=1, the two strings are s[0] and s[-1]. So the first character of s is one of the two strings, and the last character is the other.\n\nBut without knowing which is which, it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible starting character, we can build the possible s.\n\nBut with 26 letters, that's manageable for small n, but for n=100, it's still a lot.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's try to find the correct s by considering that s must have all its prefixes and suffixes present in the input.\n\nSo for s, all the prefixes (lengths 1 to n-1) and suffixes (lengths 1 to n-1) must be in the input, exactly once each, except for the full string s itself.\n\nWait, but the input contains exactly 2n-2 strings, each of length 1 to n-1, and each length has exactly two strings.\n\nSo for each k, exactly two strings are present, and each is either a prefix or a suffix.\n\nThus, for each k, one string is a prefix, the other is a suffix.\n\nSo, for each k, we can represent the two options as (A, B), meaning A is the prefix, B is the suffix, or (B, A).\n\nNow, the challenge is to find a way to select for each k which string is the prefix and which is the suffix, such that the resulting s is consistent.\n\nMoreover, the prefixes form a chain where each prefix is the start of the next, and similarly for the suffixes.\n\nSo, for each k, the prefix of length k+1 must start with the prefix of length k. Similarly, the suffix of length k+1 must end with the suffix of length k.\n\nSo, let's think about grouping the strings by their lengths. For each k, we have two strings: s1 and s2.\n\nWe need to choose for each k whether s1 is the prefix and s2 the suffix, or vice versa, such that the prefixes form a chain and the suffixes form a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to arrange the prefixes in a chain where each is a prefix of the next, and similarly for the suffixes.\n\nSo, for each k, the chosen prefix for k must be a prefix of the chosen prefix for k+1.\n\nSimilarly, the chosen suffix for k must be a suffix of the chosen suffix for k+1.\n\nWait, but for k from 1 to n-2, the next k+1 depends on the current choice.\n\nThis suggests that the prefixes and suffixes form chains.\n\nSo, perhaps the algorithm is as follows:\n\n1. For each k from 1 to n-1, collect the two strings of that length.\n\n2. For each k, decide which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix, ensuring that for the prefix chain, each step is a prefix of the next, and for the suffix chain, each step is a suffix of the next.\n\nBut how to model this? It sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where for each k, we track possible states (the current prefix and suffix) and see if they can extend to the next k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can greedily build the prefix and suffix chains.\n\nAnother idea: The prefix chain must form a sequence where each subsequent string is longer and starts with the previous. Similarly for the suffix chain.\n\nSo, for each possible starting string of length 1, which is a prefix, we can try to build the prefix chain.\n\nWait, but the starting string of length 1 could be either of the two strings of length 1. So for each possible starting string of length 1, try to build the prefix chain.\n\nSimilarly, for the suffix chain, the ending string of length 1 could be either of the two, and the rest of the chain would have to fit.\n\nBut again, for n=100, this could be computationally heavy.\n\nWait, perhaps for the prefixes, the correct chain is the one where each string is a proper prefix of the next. So for each k, the two strings must be such that one is a prefix of the other.\n\nBut that's not necessarily the case. For example, in the third sample input, the two strings for k=1 are 'a' and 'c'. So for k=1, the correct s could be 'ac' where 'a' is the prefix and 'c' is the suffix. Or 'ca' where 'c' is the prefix and 'a' is the suffix.\n\nIn this case, the prefixes are 'a' and 'c' for the two possible s's, but the prefixes for each s are single-character strings.\n\nWait, no. For s = 'ac', the prefixes are 'a' (k=1) and 'ac' (k=2). For s = 'ca', the prefixes are 'c' and 'ca'.\n\nSo in this case, the two strings of k=1 for the prefixes are 'a' and 'c', which are the two possible options.\n\nHmm, this complicates things.\n\nAlternative approach: For each possible pair of strings (p, s) where p is a prefix of length m and s is a suffix of length m, and for each m from 1 to n-1, check if the entire set forms a valid structure.\n\nBut again, this seems computationally intensive.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be approached by considering that the correct s is uniquely determined by the input. So perhaps we can find s by building it step by step.\n\nLet me think about the prefixes and suffixes:\n\nSuppose that for each k, the two strings are s1 and s2. For the prefixes, one of them is the prefix of length k, and the other is the suffix of length k.\n\nBut how do we find out which one is which?\n\nAnother idea: The correct s must start with the prefix of length 1, which is one of the two strings of length 1. Then, the prefix of length 2 must start with the prefix of length 1. Similarly, the suffix of length 1 must end with the suffix of length 2.\n\nWait, maybe it's possible to build the prefix and suffix chains incrementally.\n\nFor the prefixes:\n\n- Start with all possible strings of length 1 that are prefixes.\n\nFor each possible starting string of length 1 (either of the two in the input), attempt to build the prefix chain.\n\nAt each step k, check if the chosen prefix for k is a prefix of any of the possible candidates for k+1.\n\nSimilarly, for the suffixes:\n\n- Start with all possible strings of length 1 that are suffixes.\n\nFor each possible ending string of length 1 (either of the two in the input), attempt to build the suffix chain.\n\nAgain, at each step k, check if the chosen suffix for k is a suffix of any of the possible candidates for k+1.\n\nBut how to combine these two chains?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct s is the concatenation of the prefix chain and the suffix chain, but only if the last character of the prefix chain matches the first character of the suffix chain.\n\nNo, that's not necessarily the case. For example, in the third sample, s is 'ac' or 'ca'. The prefix chain is 'a' and 'ac' for the first case, and 'c' and 'ca' for the second. The suffix chain is 'c' and 'ac' for the first case, and 'a' and 'ca' for the second.\n\nWait, but in the first case, the suffix chain for k=1 is 'c', and for k=2 it's 'ac', which is a suffix of 'ac'.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck here.\n\nAlternative approach inspired by the example:\n\nPerhaps the correct s is such that for each k, the prefix of length k is the first k characters of s, and the suffix of length k is the last k characters of s.\n\nThus, for each k, the two strings in the input must consist of the prefix and suffix of s.\n\nBut how can we find s?\n\nAnother idea: For each possible string s of length n, check whether the given input strings can be partitioned into prefixes and suffixes of s.\n\nBut n can be up to 100, making this approach impossible due to the sheer number of possibilities.\n\nSo we need a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct s is the one that can be built by combining the maximum possible prefix chain and maximum possible suffix chain.\n\nHere's an outline of the approach:\n\n1. For each possible way to choose the prefix chain:\n\n   a. For each k from 1 to n-1, choose one of the two strings of length k as the prefix, ensuring that each step is a prefix of the next.\n\n   b. Once the prefix chain is built, the suffix chain must be built in a way that each step is a suffix of the next, and the last character of the suffix chain must match the first character of the prefix chain.\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct s can be found by finding a common superstring of all the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut that's vague.\n\nAnother angle: Since the problem allows any valid answer, perhaps we can find s by greedily building it.\n\nLet's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, for each possible s of length n, the first character is the prefix of length 1, and the last character is the suffix of length 1.\n\nSo, the two strings of length 1 are s[0] and s[-1].\n\nThus, for the two length 1 strings, one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. So, their first characters must be s[0] and s[-1], respectively.\n\nBut without knowing which is which, it's unclear.\n\nWait, but for the two length 1 strings, one is the prefix, the other is the suffix. So, for s, the first character is one of them, and the last is the other.\n\nThus, the two length 1 strings are s[0] and s[-1], but the order is unknown.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct s can be determined by trying all possible combinations of the two length 1 strings as s[0] and s[-1], and for each combination, see if the rest of the strings can form a valid prefix and suffix chain.\n\nBut for n=100, trying all possible combinations is manageable because for each of the two length 1 strings, there are two possibilities for which is s[0] and which is s[-1].\n\nSo the total number of possibilities is 2 * 2 = 4, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but for each possibility, we have to check if the rest of the strings can form a valid chain.\n\nSo let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Collect all the strings grouped by their lengths. For each k from 1 to n-1, we have two strings: let's call them a and b.\n\n2. For each possible way to assign the two length 1 strings as s[0] and s[-1], i.e., four possibilities:\n\n   a. s[0] = s1, s[-1] = s2\n\n   b. s[0] = s2, s[-1] = s1\n\n   Where s1 and s2 are the two length 1 strings.\n\n3. For each possibility, try to build the prefix chain and the suffix chain:\n\n   a. Prefix chain: starts with s[0], then for k=2, find a string in the input of length 2 that starts with the previous prefix (s[0]) and is also a possible prefix of s.\n\n   b. Similarly, for the suffix chain: starts with s[-1], then for k=2, find a string in the input of length 2 that ends with the previous suffix (s[-1]).\n\n   c. Continue building the prefix and suffix chains for higher k until all possible strings are accounted for.\n\n4. If for a particular assignment of s[0] and s[-1], the prefix and suffix chains can be built correctly, then this s is the correct string, and we can assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet's think about the process in code.\n\nFirst, group the input strings by their lengths.\n\nThen, for each possible assignment of s[0] and s[-1], as described:\n\nFor each k from 1 to n-1:\n\n   For the current assignment, the prefix of length k is either a or b.\n\n   We can try to build the prefix chain:\n\n   - The first character is s[0].\n\n   - For k=2, the prefix must be a string of length 2 that starts with the prefix of length 1.\n\n   But which of the two strings of length 2 is the correct one?\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible k, the correct prefix is the one that starts with the previous prefix, and the correct suffix is the one that ends with the previous suffix.\n\nBut how to decide which string is the prefix and which is the suffix for each k.\n\nWait, perhaps for each k, we can collect all possible candidates for the prefix of length k and the suffix of length k, based on the previous steps.\n\nBut again, this can get complicated.\n\nAlternative approach inspired by the sample:\n\nIn the first sample, the correct s is \"ababa\".\n\nThe prefixes are 'a', 'ab', 'aba', 'abab'.\n\nThe suffixes are 'a', 'ba', 'aba', 'baba'.\n\nEach of these appears exactly once in the input.\n\nThus, for each k, the two strings in the input are one prefix and one suffix.\n\nSo, for the algorithm:\n\nFor each possible assignment of s[0] and s[-1], as per the length 1 strings:\n\n   For each k from 1 to n-1:\n\n      The prefix of length k must be a string that starts with the previous prefix and is present in the input.\n\n      Similarly, the suffix of length k must be a string that ends with the previous suffix and is present in the input.\n\nBut how to manage this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible initial assignment (s0 and sn), we can try to build the prefix and suffix chains step by step.\n\nLet's outline this in more detail.\n\nAlgorithm steps:\n\n1. Read all the input strings, group them by their lengths.\n\n2. For each possible way to assign the two length 1 strings as s[0] and s[-1]:\n\n   a. Let current_s0 = s0_candidate, current_sn = sn_candidate.\n\n   b. Initialize the prefix_chain and suffix_chain.\n\n      - prefix_chain[1] = current_s0.\n\n      - suffix_chain[1] = current_sn.\n\n   c. For k from 2 to n-1:\n\n      i. Among the strings of length k, find those that start with prefix_chain[k-1]. These are the candidates for the prefix of length k.\n\n      ii. Among the strings of length k, find those that end with suffix_chain[k-1]. These are the candidates for the suffix of length k.\n\n      iii. Check if there's a way to choose one as the new prefix and the other as the new suffix.\n\n      iv. Also, ensure that the new prefix starts with the previous prefix, and the new suffix ends with the previous suffix.\n\n      v. Additionally, the last character of the new prefix must match the first character of the new suffix, because when you build the full string s, the prefix and suffix must overlap correctly.\n\nWait, no. The full string s is built by the prefix chain and the suffix chain, but they may not necessarily align. Wait, no, because s is the concatenation of the prefix chain and the reverse of the suffix chain (excluding the overlapping character).\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think: The full string s is the prefix_chain[n-1], and the suffix_chain is built as the last k characters. So s is equal to the prefix_chain[n-1], and the suffix_chain[k] must be the last k characters of s.\n\nThus, for each k, the suffix_chain[k] must be the last k characters of s.\n\nSo, for k=2, the suffix_chain[2] must be the last two characters of s.\n\nBut s is the prefix_chain[n-1], so the last two characters of s are s[-2:].\n\nThus, for k=2, the suffix_chain[2] must be equal to s[-2:], which is the last two characters of the prefix_chain[n-1].\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case because the suffix_chain is built independently.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nOnce the prefix_chain is built up to n-1, the suffix_chain must be the suffixes of the full s.\n\nThus, for each k, the suffix_chain[k] must be the last k characters of s, which is prefix_chain[n-1].\n\nThus, for each k, the suffix_chain[k] must be a substring of s starting at position (n - k).\n\nSo, during the process, once the prefix_chain is built, the suffix_chain can be derived as the last k characters of the prefix_chain[n-1].\n\nThus, for each k, the suffix_chain[k] must be equal to the last k characters of s.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm could be:\n\nFor each possible assignment of s0 and sn (the two length 1 strings):\n\n   a. Build the prefix_chain as follows:\n\n      i. prefix_chain[1] = s0.\n\n      ii. For k from 2 to n-1:\n\n          Among the strings of length k, find those that start with prefix_chain[k-1]. These are the possible candidates for prefix_chain[k].\n\n          Choose one as prefix_chain[k], ensuring that the next step can continue.\n\n   b. Once the prefix_chain is built, the suffix_chain is determined as the last k characters of prefix_chain[n-1], for each k.\n\n   c. Check if for each k, the corresponding suffix_chain[k] is present in the input.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, then this assignment is valid, and we can proceed to assign 'P' and 'S' accordingly.\n\nSimilarly, after building the prefix_chain, the suffix_chain is determined, and we can verify if all required suffixes are present.\n\nSo the steps in code would be:\n\n1. Read all input strings, group them by length.\n\n2. For each possible assignment of the two length 1 strings as s0 and sn:\n\n   a. Try to build the prefix_chain:\n\n      i. prefix_chain starts with s0.\n\n      ii. For k from 2 to n-1:\n\n          Look at the group of strings of length k.\n\n          Filter those that start with prefix_chain[k-1].\n\n          If there's exactly one such string, proceed.\n\n          Else, backtrack (this assignment is invalid).\n\n   b. Once prefix_chain is built, extract s as prefix_chain[n-1].\n\n   c. For each k from 1 to n-1:\n\n          Compute the expected suffix_chain[k] as s[-k:].\n\n          Check if this string exists in the input group of length k.\n\n   d. If all expected suffix_chain[k] exist, then this assignment is valid.\n\n   e. Record the assignment as a possible solution.\n\n3. After checking all possible assignments, find one that works.\n\nOnce a valid s is found, create the output string by assigning 'P' or 'S' to each input string based on whether it is a prefix or a suffix in the s.\n\nBut how to handle cases where multiple s's are possible? Since the problem allows any valid answer, it's sufficient to find one such s.\n\nNow, the implementation details:\n\n- How to group the strings by length.\n\n- For each possible assignment of s0 and sn, attempt to build the prefix_chain.\n\n- During the building of the prefix_chain, for each k, select the next possible string.\n\nBut wait, for each k, there are two strings in the input. So when building the prefix_chain, for each k, the next string must be one of the two.\n\nSo for each step k, the next string must be one of the two available strings of length k, and must start with the previous prefix.\n\nThus, for each step, if there's more than one option, it's a branching point, leading to multiple possibilities to explore.\n\nThis makes the problem similar to a state-space search, where each state is a partial prefix_chain and the current step.\n\nBut for n up to 100, this could become computationally expensive.\n\nAlternative idea: To try to greedily choose the next possible string for the prefix_chain.\n\nAt each step k, among the possible strings of length k that start with prefix_chain[k-1], pick the one that allows the longest possible continuation.\n\nBut this is heuristic and may not work for all cases.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible assignment of s0 and sn, try to build the prefix_chain in a way that for each step, the next string is the one that allows the maximum possible future choices.\n\nBut again, this may not always work.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem allows any valid answer, perhaps we can find a way to greedily build the prefix_chain by always choosing the string that starts with the previous prefix, and has the maximum possible matching for the next steps.\n\nBut this requires a way to model possible future steps, which may be computationally heavy.\n\nAn alternative approach is to precompute for each possible assignment of s0 and sn, and for each k, the possible next strings in the prefix_chain.\n\nBut with n=100, and for each step having 2 options, this is 2^99 steps, which is impossible.\n\nThus, perhaps a better way is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct s can be uniquely determined by the input, so for each possible s0 and sn, there's at most one way to build the prefix_chain.\n\nIn that case, the algorithm can proceed as:\n\nFor each possible assignment of s0 and sn:\n\n   a. Try to build the prefix_chain as follows:\n\n      i. prefix_chain[1] = s0.\n\n      ii. For k=2 to n-1:\n\n          Look for the two strings of length k.\n\n          For each, check if it starts with prefix_chain[k-1].\n\n          If exactly one does, set prefix_chain[k] to that string.\n\n          If none, or more than one, this assignment is invalid.\n\n   b. If the prefix_chain is successfully built, then extract s as prefix_chain[n-1].\n\n   c. For each k, check if the expected suffix_chain[k] (s[-k:]) is present in the input.\n\n   d. If all suffix_chain[k] are present, return this s as the correct one.\n\nThus, this approach tries each possible assignment of s0 and sn, and for each, attempts to build the prefix_chain greedily by choosing the only possible string at each step.\n\nIf this results in a valid s, then it's the correct s.\n\nThis seems manageable because for each assignment, the steps are linear in n, and there are only 4 assignments.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop over the two possible ways to assign the two length 1 strings as s0 and sn.\n\nFor each assignment:\n\n   Build the prefix_chain:\n\n      current_prefix = s0.\n\n      for k from 2 to n-1:\n\n          get the list of two strings of length k.\n\n          filter them to find which start with current_prefix.\n\n          if exactly one such string exists, set current_prefix to it.\n\n          else, this assignment is invalid.\n\n   if the prefix_chain is built completely:\n\n      s = current_prefix.\n\n      for each k from 1 to n-1:\n\n          expected_suffix = s[-k:]\n\n          check if expected_suffix exists in the input.\n\n          if not, break.\n\n      else:\n\n          return this s as the correct one.\n\nThus, in code, for each possible assignment of s0 and sn, we try to build the prefix_chain, and if it's valid, check the suffixes.\n\nOnce such an s is found, the answer can be generated.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this.\n\nFirst, read all the input strings, group them by their lengths.\n\nFor the two length 1 strings, s1 and s2, generate all possible assignments of s0 and sn.\n\nThere are two possibilities: s0 = s1, sn = s2; or s0 = s2, sn = s1.\n\nWait, no, because for the assignment, it's possible that s0 is one of the two, and sn is the other. So for each of the two length 1 strings, assign it to s0 and the other to sn.\n\nSo for each possible pair (a, b) where a and b are the two length 1 strings, in both orders.\n\nSo, for the two length 1 strings, there are 2 possible assignments:\n\n1. s0 = a, sn = b.\n\n2. s0 = b, sn = a.\n\nThus, in code, for each of these two possibilities, proceed.\n\nNow, for each step in building the prefix_chain:\n\nFor each k from 2 to n-1:\n\n   collect the two strings of length k.\n\n   filter them to see which start with the current_prefix.\n\n   if exactly one string remains, that's the next prefix.\n\n   else, this assignment is invalid.\n\nThus, for each k, we have to look at the two strings of length k.\n\nSo in code, for each assignment:\n\ncurrent_prefix = s0.\n\nprefix_chain = [current_prefix]\n\nfor k in 2 to n-1:\n\n   possible_prefixes = [x for x in input_strings_of_length_k if x.startswith(current_prefix)]\n\n   if len(possible_prefixes) != 1:\n\n       break and mark as invalid.\n\n   current_prefix = possible_prefixes[0]\n\n   prefix_chain.append(current_prefix)\n\nif the loop completes, then s is current_prefix.\n\nThen, for each k from 1 to n-1:\n\n   expected_suffix = s[-k:]\n\n   if expected_suffix not in input_strings_of_length_k:\n\n       invalid.\n\nThus, after building s, we check if all expected suffixes are present.\n\nIf yes, then this s is valid.\n\nOnce a valid s is found, we can proceed to generate the output string.\n\nBut what if neither assignment of the length 1 strings leads to a valid s? Then, the problem statement says that it's guaranteed that there is at least one possible s, so this shouldn't happen.\n\nThus, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead all 2n-2 strings, stripping any newlines.\n\nGroup the strings by their lengths. For each length k, collect the two strings.\n\nSeparate the two length 1 strings, s_a and s_b.\n\nFor each possible assignment (s0, sn):\n\n   a. s0 = s_a, sn = s_b.\n\n   b. s0 = s_b, sn = s_a.\n\n   For each assignment:\n\n      build the prefix_chain.\n\n      if successful:\n\n          s = prefix_chain[-1]\n\n          check for all k in 1..n-1:\n\n              expected_suffix = s[-k:]\n\n              if expected_suffix not in the group for k:\n\n                  break.\n\n          if all expected_suffix are present:\n\n              record this s as valid.\n\n              break out of the loop.\n\nOnce a valid s is found, generate the output string.\n\nGenerate the output string as follows:\n\nfor each input string in the original order:\n\n   if it's a prefix of s, output 'P'\n\n   else, output 'S'\n\nBut wait, how to determine if a string is a prefix of s.\n\nBecause for each string in the input, it's either a prefix or a suffix of s.\n\nThus, for each input string, if it's in the prefix_chain, it's a prefix, else it's a suffix.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nprecomputed = set(prefix_chain)\n\nfor each string in input_order:\n\n   if string in precomputed:\n\n       output 'P'\n\n   else:\n\n       output 'S'\n\nWait, no. Because the suffix_chain is the last k characters of s, but the actual suffix_chain may include the same strings as some of the prefixes.\n\nThus, the above approach may not work.\n\nWait, no. Because for each string in the input, it's either a prefix or a suffix of s. So for each string, we can determine whether it is a prefix or a suffix by checking if it is in the prefix_chain or the suffix_chain.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\nFor each string in the input:\n\n   if it is in the prefix_chain: it's a prefix → 'P'\n\n   else: it's a suffix → 'S'\n\nBut how to compute the suffix_chain.\n\nWait, the suffix_chain can be derived from s.\n\nFor each k, the expected suffix",
