Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of used candles needed to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have 'a' candles. Each candle burns for 1 hour and then becomes a used candle.\n   - We can take 'b' used candles and convert them into one new candle (which can then be burned).\n\n How the process goes?\n   - First, we burn as many new candles as we have. Let's say we start with 'a' candles.\n   - We burn all 'a' candles, which gives us 'a' hours of light and leaves us with 'a' used candles.\n   - Then, we can form floor(a / b) new candles from these used ones, and we are left with a % b used candles.\n\n But note: the new candles we form can also be burned and then become used again. So we can continue the process until we don't have enough used candles to form a new one.\n\n Steps:\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_candles = a\n   used_candles = 0\n\n However, we can simulate:\n\n   Step 1: Burn all current_candles (each gives 1 hour) -> total_hours += current_candles\n            Then we have current_candles used candles (from burning) and we also have the previous used_candles? \n            Actually, we should account for the used candles that we have from before.\n\n Alternatively, we can think:\n\n   total_used = 0\n   total_new = a   # initially\n   hours = 0\n\n   while total_new > 0:\n        # Burn all new candles\n        hours += total_new\n        # Now, these total_new candles become used, so we have total_used += total_new\n        total_used += total_new\n        # Now, we can form new candles from the used ones: each 'b' used candles make one new candle.\n        total_new = total_used // b\n        remaining_used = total_used % b\n\n        # But wait, after forming the new candles, we are left with some remaining_used. However, note that the new candles are formed and then burned, but the remaining_used is kept for next cycle.\n\n        # However, we must not lose the remaining_used. Actually, the problem does not specify that we can mix cycles arbitrarily, but we can keep the remaining_used in the next cycle.\n\n        # But note: we just did the entire process: we burned the current_new, then we have total_used (which includes the previous ones). Then we form new candles from the total_used, and the leftover used candles (remaining_used) will be carried over.\n\n        # However, in the next iteration, we only have the new candles (total_new) to burn, and then the used candles from this set (the same total_new) plus the leftover from previous? \n\n   But wait, the above simulation would accumulate total_used from every burning. However, the problem is that after burning the new candles, we have to account for the used candles from the previous cycles as well.\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n   Let:\n     candles = a   # the current number of candles we can burn (new or recycled)\n     used = 0      # the current stock of used candles\n\n   Then, while we have candles (either new or recycled), we can burn them.\n\n   But note: the process is that we burn a candle and then it becomes used. Then we can use the used ones to make more candles.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   total = 0\n   current = a\n   while current > 0:\n        total += current\n        # Now, we have current used candles (because we burned 'current' candles) and we can make new ones from the total used candles?\n        # But wait, we haven't tracked the total used candles separately.\n\n   Another way:\n\n   We can break down:\n\n   Step 0: We start with a new candles (a) and 0 used.\n   Step 1: Burn the a candles -> get a hours, and now we have a used candles.\n        Then, we can make floor(a / b) new candles, and the remaining used candles are a % b.\n\n   Step 2: Now we have the new candles (floor(a/b)) and we also have the remaining used (a % b). So we can consider the next step: burn the floor(a/b) candles -> get floor(a/b) hours, and then we have (a % b) + floor(a/b) used candles.\n\n   Then, we can make floor( (a % b + floor(a/b)) / b ) new candles, etc.\n\n   This is similar to:\n\n   total = a\n   candles = a\n   while candles >= b:\n        # But actually, we can use the used candles to make more, but we also have the initial ones.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The key observation here is that each candle burns for one hour and then becomes a used candle. These used candles can be combined in groups of `b` to form new candles, which can then be burned again. The process continues until there are not enough used candles left to form a new candle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with `a` new candles. Each candle provides one hour of light.\n2. **Burning Candles**: Burn all available candles (either new or recycled) to get the maximum hours. After burning, these candles become used.\n3. **Recycling Used Candles**: Use the used candles to create new ones. Specifically, every `b` used candles can be converted into one new candle.\n4. **Repeat Until Exhaustion**: Continue the process of burning candles and recycling used ones until there are fewer than `b` used candles left, at which point no more new candles can be formed.\n\nThe algorithm involves iteratively burning candles and converting the resulting used candles into new ones until it's no longer possible. The total hours are accumulated during each burning phase.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    total_hours = 0\n    current_candles = a\n    leftover_used = 0\n    \n    while current_candles > 0:\n        total_hours += current_candles\n        current_candles = (leftover_used + current_candles) // b\n        leftover_used = (leftover_used + current_candles) % b\n    \n    print(total_hours)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The program reads the initial number of candles (`a`) and the required number of used candles to form a new one (`b`).\n2. **Loop Until No More Candles**: The loop continues as long as there are candles to burn (`current_candles > 0`).\n3. **Burning Phase**: In each iteration, the current number of candles is added to `total_hours` (each candle burns for one hour). The candles are then converted into new ones based on the ratio `b`.\n4. **Recycling Phase**: The used candles (both leftover from previous iterations and those just burned) are divided by `b` to determine how many new candles can be made. The remainder after division becomes the leftover used candles for the next iteration.\n5. **Termination**: The loop exits when there are no more candles to burn, and the total hours accumulated are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning and recycling candles, ensuring the maximum number of hours is achieved by leveraging all available resources optimally.",
