There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament with n players, given that two players can only play if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\nObservation:\nIn a standard knockout tournament, the winner must win all his games. However, the grid arrangement is constrained by the rule: two players can only play if their previous game counts differ by at most one.\n\nWe can think of the tournament as being divided into rounds, but note that the rule allows for a more flexible pairing. The key is to maximize the number of games the winner plays.\n\nLet k be the total number of games the winner plays. Then the winner must defeat k opponents. Moreover, the tournament structure must allow the winner to accumulate k wins while satisfying the condition on the number of prior games.\n\nAnother way to look at it: we are effectively trying to build a path (for the winner) of k wins, and the entire tournament must have a structure that accommodates this.\n\nConsider that the tournament is a complete binary tree? But note: the constraint is not just about the round, but about the entire history.\n\nActually, we can model the tournament as having two halves: one where the winner accumulates games and the other half must provide the necessary opponents.\n\nBut note: the problem is similar to building a sequence of wins for the winner such that when he plays his k-th game, the next opponent must have a history of either k-1 or k (but wait, actually the rule is about the difference being at most one). However, the winner's record increases with each win, so the opponents in his path must have been built up appropriately.\n\nWe can use recursion or dynamic programming, but note that n can be up to 10^18, so we need a mathematical/logical approach.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of the maximum k such that there exists a tournament structure where the winner wins k games, and the entire tournament has at least k+1 players (since the winner must defeat k distinct players). But note: the tournament is knockout, so the total number of matches is n-1.\n\nHowever, the constraint on the pairing complicates things.\n\nLet f(k) be the minimum number of players required to allow a player to win k games under the given rule.\n\nHow do we compute f(k)?\n\nBase cases:\n- To win 0 games: 1 player (the winner without playing)\n- To win 1 game: we need the winner and one opponent, so 2 players.\n- To win 2 games: the winner must first play one opponent, then another. But the second opponent must have played at most 1 game (because the winner has 1 game, so the difference must be at most one). However, the second opponent must have been defeated in his first game (if he played one). So we need to account for the entire subtree.\n\nActually, consider:\n\nTo have a player win k games, we can break the tournament into two parts:\n\n1. The winner's own path: k wins, which requires k opponents.\n2. The opponents' subtrees: each opponent must have won some games (say, j) before losing to the winner. The condition is that when the winner plays an opponent, the opponent must have played either j = k-1 or j = k-2 (or maybe j = k-1, k-2, but note the winner's games: at the time of the match, the winner has played (number of wins so far) and the opponent has played j.\n\nBut wait, the rule says: two players can play only if the absolute difference between their current number of games is at most one.\n\nSo when the winner is about to play his k-th game, he has already played k-1 games, and the opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2.\n\nSimilarly, when the winner plays his first game, the opponent must have 0 or 1? Actually, initially, both have 0. Then after the first win, the winner has 1 and the opponent leaves with 0 or 1 (if the opponent had played before, but initially no). However, the problem states that the tournament hasn't started so initially everyone has 0.\n\nBut note: the entire tournament must be arranged according to the rule. We are free to arrange the grid arbitrarily (as long as the rule holds for every game).\n\nWe can use a recursive structure:\n\nf(0) = 1\nf(1) = 2\nFor k>=2, we can consider:\n\nThe winner must have two types of opponents in his k games:\n\n- Some opponents that were defeated in the winner's k-th game (so they must have played k-1 or k-2 games before that)\n- But actually, the entire tournament must be built so that the winner's opponents are themselves winners of subtrees.\n\nWe can define:\n\nf(k) = 1 + f(k-",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if the difference in their previous game counts is at most one. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the tournament structure must allow the winner to play as many games as possible while adhering to the given constraint. The solution involves finding the largest integer \\( k \\) such that the total number of players \\( n \\) is sufficient to support \\( k \\) wins for the winner under the specified rules.\n2. **Insight**: The problem can be approached by recognizing that the minimum number of players required for a winner to have \\( k \\) wins follows a specific pattern. For \\( k = 0 \\), 1 player is needed. For \\( k = 1 \\), 2 players are needed. For higher values of \\( k \\), the number of players required is the sum of the players needed for \\( k-1 \\) and \\( k-2 \\) wins plus one additional player (the winner themselves).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution uses a recursive approach to compute the minimum number of players required for \\( k \\) wins. However, given the constraints (n can be as large as \\( 10^{18} \\)), a more efficient method is employed by leveraging mathematical patterns and binary search to determine the maximum \\( k \\) directly without excessive computation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    # We will use a recursive function but with memoization or iterative method for efficiency\n    # Alternatively, we can use a known pattern: f(k) = 2^k - 1 doesn't hold, but we can use a different recurrence.\n    # Let f(k) be the minimum number of players needed to have a tournament where the winner plays k games.\n    # f(0) = 1\n    # f(1) = 2\n    # f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2) + 1   for k >= 2\n    \n    # But note: the recurrence above is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with an extra +1.\n    # However, let's verify with small values:\n    # f(0) = 1\n    # f(1) = 2\n    # f(2) = f(1) + f(0) + 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 -> but the example says for n=4, answer is 2, meaning k=2 requires 4 players? Actually, the example input 4 gives output 2, so the winner plays 2 games. So indeed, f(2) should be 4.\n    # f(3) = f(2) + f(1) + 1 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 -> so for 7 players, the winner can play 3 games.\n    \n    # We are to find the maximum k such that f(k) <= n.\n    # Since n can be very large (up to 10^18), we cannot iterate k from 0 upwards until f(k) exceeds n because k can be up to around 100 (since Fibonacci grows exponentially). But we can use binary search or simply iterate until we exceed n because the maximum k is logarithmic in n (base golden ratio).\n\n    def min_players_for_k_wins(k):\n        if k == 0:\n            return 1\n        elif k == 1:\n            return 2\n        else:\n            a, b = 1, 2\n            for i in range(2, k+1):\n                next_val = a + b + 1\n                a, b = b, next_val\n            return b\n\n    # But note: we need the maximum k such that min_players_for_k_wins(k) <= n.\n    # However, the above function computes f(k) correctly for k>=0.\n\n    # We'll find the maximum k such that f(k) <= n.\n    k = 0\n    a, b = 1, 2\n    while b <= n:\n        k += 1\n        a, b = b, a + b + 1\n\n    # Now, the winner can play k games, but note: in the loop, we break when b (f(k)) exceeds n.\n    # Then k is the last value for which f(k) <= n.\n    # But wait, in the loop, we start from k=0 (a=1, b=2) and then increment k and update a and b.\n    # Actually, we started with k=0, then set a=1, b=2 (which is f(1)). Then we enter the loop and compute for k=1 (but we already have k=0). Let me reframe.\n\n    # Better to start with k=0, and then simulate until we exceed n.\n\n    # Alternatively, we can adjust the loop to start from k=0 and then check the next value.\n    # Let me rewrite the loop:\n\n    # Initialize for k=0 and k=1.\n    # We know for k=0: players_needed = 1\n    # k=1: players_needed = 2\n    # We want the maximum k such that players_needed <= n.\n\n    # Let k = 0, and then we can go up to k_max where f(k_max) <= n.\n\n    # Instead, we can do:\n    k = 1\n    a, b = 1, 2\n    while b <= n:\n        k += 1\n        a, b = b, a + b + 1\n\n    # Now, the answer is k-1? Because in the loop, we break when for k (current value) the players needed (b) exceeds n. But note, when we break, k is the first value for which f(k) > n, so the maximum valid k is k-1.\n\n    # However, let's test with n=2:\n    # Initially, k=1, a=1, b=2 -> condition: 2<=2 -> true, then k becomes 2, and a=2, b= (1+2+1)=4 -> 4>2 -> break. Then k=2, so answer would be k-1=1. Correct.\n    # For n=3: \n    # k=1, a=1, b=2 -> 2<=3 -> true, then k=2, a=2, b=4 -> 4>3 -> break. Answer=1, but expected output for n=3 is 2? Wait, no: the example input 3 gives output 2. So there's a discrepancy.\n\n    # Let me check the example: \n    # Input: 3 -> Output: 2\n    # Our method: for k=2, we require 4 players, but n=3. So how can the winner play 2 games with only 3 players?\n    # The example states: \"In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3.\" So with 3 players, the winner plays 2 games. This implies that our function f(k) might not be correctly modeling the requirement.\n\n    # Let me reexamine the recurrence:\n    # To have a winner with k wins, the tournament must have:\n    # - The winner himself.\n    # - Two subtrees: one for the matches where the opponent has played k-1 games (so that they can challenge the winner who has played k-1 games before) and another for the matches where the opponent has played k-2 games (so that they can challenge the winner who has played k-1 games, but the difference is 1).\n    # Therefore, the total players required is 1 (for the winner) + f(k-1) + f(k-2). \n    # But note: the winner does not necessarily defeat all opponents from the same subtree. Actually, the standard way to build such a tournament is to have two subtrees: one that provides opponents with k-1 wins (so they can challenge the winner who has k-1 wins) and another that provides opponents with k-2 wins (so they can challenge the winner who has k-1 wins, making the difference 1). However, the entire tournament must include these two subtrees and the winner.\n\n    # But wait, the recurrence I used was: f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2) + 1. However, the example with n=3 and k=2 requires 1 (winner) + f(1) [for the opponent with 1 win] + f(0) [for the opponent with 0 wins]. So f(2) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. But with 3 players, we can have the winner play two games. How?\n\n    # Actually, the recurrence might be incorrect. Let's think again:\n    # In order for the winner to play k games, he must have k opponents. Each opponent must come from a subtree that has been built according to the rules. However, the subtrees themselves must be arranged such that the root of each subtree (the player who meets the winner) has either k-1 or k-2 wins. \n\n    # But note: the entire tournament has n players. The winner is one, and the rest are distributed between two groups: those who meet the winner in his k-th game and those who meet him earlier. However, the structure is such that the winner's path is built by combining two smaller tournaments: one for k-1 wins and one for k-2 wins. \n\n    # However, the example with 3 players: \n    # The winner plays two games. The first game: he defeats one player (who has 0 wins). Then he defeats another player (who also has 0 wins). But wait, after the first game, the winner has 1 win, and the second opponent must have at most 1 win. Since the second opponent hasn't played any game (or perhaps they lost their only game), they have 0 wins. The difference is 1, which is allowed. \n\n    # Therefore, the recurrence should account for the fact that the two subtrees can share some players? Actually, no, because the players are distinct. \n\n    # Let me define:\n    # Let g(k) be the minimum number of players needed so that one player can win k games under the rule.\n\n    # Base cases:\n    # g(0) = 1 (no game, just the winner)\n    # g(1) = 2 (the winner and one opponent)\n\n    # For k>=2, consider the last game the winner plays. In that game, the opponent must have either k-1 or k-2 wins. \n    # Case 1: Opponent has k-1 wins. Then the opponent came from a tournament of size g(k-1). But note, the winner had k-1 wins before this game, so the opponent must have won k-1 games (including the one against someone else). However, the entire tournament for the opponent requires g(k-1) players. Similarly, the other opponents in the winner's path (the first k-1 games) must be provided by another tournament. But wait, the winner's path has k-1 wins before the last game, so the entire structure for the first k-1 wins requires g(k-1) players? \n\n    # Actually, the correct recurrence is:\n    # g(k) = 1 + g(k-1) + g(k-2)\n    # Explanation: \n    # - The winner (1 player).\n    # - The tournament for the opponents who have k-1 wins (g(k-1) players).\n    # - The tournament for the opponents who have k-2 wins (g(k-2) players).\n\n    # Now, let's compute:\n    # g(0) = 1\n    # g(1) = 1 + g(0) + g(-1) -> not defined. So base cases must be adjusted.\n\n    # Alternatively, we can define:\n    # g(0) = 1\n    # g(1) = 2\n    # g(2) = 1 + g(1) + g(0) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4\n    # g(3) = 1 + g(2) + g(1) = 1 + 4 + 2 = 7\n    # g(4) = 1 + g(3) + g(2) = 1 + 7 + 4 = 12\n\n    # Now, for n=3, what is the maximum k such that g(k) <= 3?\n    # g(0)=1 <=3 -> k=0\n    # g(1)=2 <=3 -> k=1\n    # g(2)=4 >3 -> so maximum k is 1. But the example says for n=3, the answer is 2.\n\n    # This indicates that the recurrence might not be matching the example.\n\n    # Let me re-analyze the example with n=3 (players: 1,2,3). The winner (player1) plays two games:\n    # Game1: Player1 vs Player2 -> Player1 wins. Now, Player1 has 1 win, Player2 has 0.\n    # Game2: Player1 vs Player3 -> Player1 wins. Now, Player1 has 2 wins, Player3 has 0.\n    # In the second game, the difference is 1 (Player1 has 1 win, Player3 has 0 wins) which is allowed.\n\n    # How many players are required for a winner to have 2 wins? \n    # - The winner (1 player).\n    # - The two opponents (2 players).\n    # Total: 3 players.\n\n    # Therefore, the minimum number of players for a winner to have 2 wins is 3, not 4.\n\n    # So the recurrence must be different.\n\n    # Let me try to derive:\n    # The winner must defeat k opponents. Each opponent must have a certain number of wins (either k-1 or k-2) at the moment they face the winner. But note, the entire tournament must have been structured so that these opponents were defeated in their respective matches.\n\n    # We can think of the tournament as being built in rounds, but the rule allows non-standard pairing. The key is that the winner can accumulate wins by defeating players who themselves have won some games (but not too many).\n\n    # Another approach: \n    # Let k be the number of games the winner plays. Then, the total number of players must be at least:\n    # 1 (the winner) + the number of players in the first round + the number of players in the second round + ... \n\n    # But note, the structure is not strictly binary. \n\n    # Observation: \n    # In order for the winner to play k games, we need k rounds of matches. However, the rule allows the winner to play against players who have played fewer games. This means that the tournament does not necessarily require a full binary tree.\n\n    # After careful thought, note that the problem is equivalent to finding the maximum k such that the (k+1)-th Fibonacci number (or a variant) is less than or equal to n. \n\n    # Let me list the minimal number of players required for k wins:\n    # k = 0: 1\n    # k = 1: 2\n    # k = 2: 3\n    # k = 3: 5\n    # k = 4: 9\n\n    # Pattern: 1, 2, 3, 5, 9 -> this looks like a Fibonacci-like sequence but starting from 1,2 and then each term is the sum of the previous two terms plus something.\n\n    # Check: \n    # 1, 2, 3 = 1+2, 5 = 2+3, 9 = 3+5+1? Not exactly.\n\n    # Alternatively, consider:\n    # k=0: 1\n    # k=1: 2\n    # k=2: 1 + 2 = 3\n    # k=3: 2 + 3 = 5\n    # k=4: 3 + 5 = 8? But the example for n=10 gives 4, meaning that with 10 players, the winner can play 4 games. Let's check the minimal players for 4 wins: 8? Then with 10 players, the winner can play 4 games because 8<=10.\n\n    # So the recurrence might be:\n    # g(k) = g(k-1) + g(k-2)\n    # with g(0)=1, g(1)=2.\n\n    # Then:\n    # g(2) = g(1) + g(0) = 2 + 1 = 3\n    # g(3) = g(2) + g(1) = 3 + 2 = 5\n    # g(4) = g(3) + g(2) = 5 + 3 = 8\n    # g(5) = 8 + 5 = 13\n\n    # Now, for n=10, the maximum k such that g(k) <= 10 is k=4 (since g(4)=8<=10, g(5)=13>10). The example says the answer for n=10 is 4, which matches.\n\n    # Also, for n=3: g(2)=3<=3 -> k=2, which is the expected answer.\n\n    # And for n=4: \n    # g(0)=1, g(1)=2, g(2)=3, g(3)=5 -> the maximum k for n=4 is 2 (since g(2)=3<=4 and g(3)=5>4). But the example input 4 gives output 2, which matches.\n\n    # Therefore, the recurrence is:\n    # g(0) = 1\n    # g(1) = 2\n    # g(k) = g(k-1) + g(k-2) for k>=2.\n\n    # Now, we need to find the maximum k such that g(k) <= n.\n\n    # Since n can be up to \\( 10^{18} \\), we cannot compute g(k) for large k by iterating from 0 upwards (as k would be about 100, which is manageable, but we can use a loop to compute g(k) until it exceeds n).\n\n    # Steps:\n    # 1. If n==2, print 1 (since g(1)=2<=2, but g(2)=3>2 -> k=1).\n    # 2. Otherwise, initialize two variables: a=1 (g(0)), b=2 (g(1)).\n    # 3.

The sequence starts with \\( g(0) = 1 \\) (no games) and \\( g(1) = 2 \\) (one game). For \\( k \\geq 2 \\), \\( g(k) = g(k-1) + g(k-2) \\). \n\nThe algorithm initializes the sequence values and iterates until the sequence value exceeds the given number of players \\( n \\). The maximum number of games the winner can play is then \\( k-1 \\), where \\( k \\) is the first index for which \\( g(k) \\) exceeds \\( n \\).\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large values of \\( n \\) (up to \\( 10^{18} \\)) by leveraging the exponential growth of the sequence, ensuring the loop runs in logarithmic time relative to \\( n \\).",

Because in the loop, we break when for k (current value) the players needed (b) exceeds n. But note, when we break, k is the first value for which f(k) > n, so the maximum valid k is k-1.\n\n    # However, let's test with n=2:\n    # Initially, k=1, a=1, b=2 -> condition: 2<=2 -> true, then k becomes 2, and a=2, b= (1+2+1)=4 -> 4>2 -> break. Then k=2, so answer would be k-1=1. Correct.\n    # For n=3: \n    # k=1, a=1, b=2 -> 2<=3 -> true, then k=2, a=2, b=4 -> 4>3 -> break. Answer=1, but expected output for n=3 is 2? Wait, no: the example input 3 gives output 2. So there's a discrepancy.\n\n    # Let me check the example: \n    # Input: 3 -> Output: 2\n    # Our method: for k=2, we require 4 players, but n=3. So how can the winner play 2 games with only 3 players?\n    # The example states: \"In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3.\" So with 3 players, the winner plays 2 games. This implies that our function f(k) might not be correctly modeling the requirement.\n\n    # Let me reexamine the recurrence:\n    # To have a winner with k wins, the tournament must have:\n    # - The winner himself.\n    # - Two subtrees: one for the matches where the opponent has played k-1 games (so that they can challenge the winner who has played k-1 games before) and another for the matches where the opponent has played k-2 games (so that they can challenge the winner who has played k-1 games, but the difference is 1).\n    # Therefore, the total players required is 1 (for the winner) + f(k-1) + f(k-2). \n    # But note: the winner does not necessarily defeat all opponents from the same subtree. Actually, the standard way to build such a tournament is to have two subtrees: one that provides opponents with k-1 wins (so they can challenge the winner who has k-1 wins) and another that provides opponents with k-2 wins (so they can challenge the winner who has k-1 wins, making the difference 1). However, the entire tournament must include these two subtrees and the winner.\n\n    # But wait, the recurrence I used was: f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2) + 1. However, the example with n=3 and k=2 requires 1 (winner) + f(1) [for the opponent with 1 win] + f(0) [for the opponent with 0 wins]. So f(2) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. But with 3 players, we can have the winner play two games. How?\n\n    # Actually, the recurrence might be incorrect. Let's think again:\n    # In order for the winner to play k games, he must have k opponents. Each opponent must come from a subtree that has been built according to the rules. However, the subtrees themselves must be arranged such that the root of each subtree (the player who meets the winner) has either k-1 or k-2 wins. \n\n    # But note: the entire tournament has n players. The winner is one, and the rest are distributed between two groups: those who meet the winner in his k-th game and those who meet him earlier. However, the structure is such that the winner's path is built by combining two smaller tournaments: one for k-1 wins and one for k-2 wins. \n\n    # However, the example with 3 players: \n    # The winner plays two games. The first game: he defeats one player (who has 0 wins). Then he defeats another player (who also has 0 wins). But wait, after the first game, the winner has 1 win, and the second opponent must have at most 1 win. Since the second opponent hasn't played any game (or perhaps they lost their only game), they have 0 wins. The difference is 1, which is allowed. \n\n    # Therefore, the recurrence should account for the fact that the two subtrees can share some players? Actually, no, because the players are distinct. \n\n    # Let me define:\n    # Let g(k) be the minimum number of players needed so that one player can win k games under the rule.\n\n    # Base cases:\n    # g(0) = 1 (no game, just the winner)\n    # g(1) = 2 (the winner and one opponent)\n\n    # For k>=2, consider the last game the winner plays. In that game, the opponent must have either k-1 or k-2 wins. \n    # Case 1: Opponent has k-1 wins. Then the opponent came from a tournament of size g(k-1). But note, the winner had k-1 wins before this game, so the opponent must have won k-1 games (including the one against someone else). However, the entire tournament for the opponent requires g(k-1) players. Similarly, the other opponents in the winner's path (the first k-1 games) must be provided by another tournament. But wait, the winner's path has k-1 wins before the last game, so the entire structure for the first k-1 wins requires g(k-1) players? \n\n    # Actually, the correct recurrence is:\n    # g(k) = 1 + g(k-1) + g(k-2)\n    # Explanation: \n    # - The winner (1 player).\n    # - The tournament for the opponents who have k-1 wins (g(k-1) players).\n    # - The tournament for the opponents who have k-2 wins (g(k-2) players).\n\n    # Now, let's compute:\n    # g(0) = 1\n    # g(1) = 1 + g(0) + g(-1) -> not defined. So base cases must be adjusted.\n\n    # Alternatively, we can define:\n    # g(0) = 1\n    # g(1) = 2\n    # g(2) = 1 + g(1) + g(0) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4\n    # g(3) = 1 + g(2) + g(1) = 1 + 4 + 2 = 7\n    # g(4) = 1 + g(3) + g(2) = 1 + 7 + 4 = 12\n\n    # Now, for n=3, what is the maximum k such that g(k) <= 3?\n    # g(0)=1 <=3 -> k=0\n    # g(1)=2 <=3 -> k=1\n    # g(2)=4 >3 -> so maximum k is 1. But the example says for n=3, the answer is 2.\n\n    # This indicates that the recurrence might not be matching the example.\n\n    # Let me re-analyze the example with n=3 (players: 1,2,3). The winner (player1) plays two games:\n    # Game1: Player1 vs Player2 -> Player1 wins. Now, Player1 has 1 win, Player2 has 0.\n    # Game2: Player1 vs Player3 -> Player1 wins. Now, Player1 has 2 wins, Player3 has 0.\n    # In the second game, the difference is 1 (Player1 has 1 win, Player3 has 0 wins) which is allowed.\n\n    # How many players are required for a winner to have 2 wins? \n    # - The winner (1 player).\n    # - The two opponents (2 players).\n    # Total: 3 players.\n\n    # Therefore, the minimum number of players for a winner to have 2 wins is 3, not 4.\n\n    # So the recurrence must be different.\n\n    # Let me try to derive:\n    # The winner must defeat k opponents. Each opponent must have a certain number of wins (either k-1 or k-2) at the moment they face the winner. But note, the entire tournament must have been structured so that these opponents were defeated in their respective matches.\n\n    # We can think of the tournament as being built in rounds, but the rule allows non-standard pairing. The key is that the winner can accumulate wins by defeating players who themselves have won some games (but not too many).\n\n    # Another approach: \n    # Let k be the number of games the winner plays. Then, the total number of players must be at least:\n    # 1 (the winner) + the number of players in the first round + the number of players in the second round + ... \n\n    # But note, the structure is not strictly binary. \n\n    # Observation: \n    # In order for the winner to play k games, we need k rounds of matches. However, the rule allows the winner to play against players who have played fewer games. This means that the tournament does not necessarily require a full binary tree.\n\n    # After careful thought, note that the problem is equivalent to finding the maximum k such that the (k+1)-th Fibonacci number (or a variant) is less than or equal to n. \n\n    # Let me list the minimal number of players required for k wins:\n    # k = 0: 1\n    # k = 1: 2\n    # k = 2: 3\n    # k = 3: 5\n    # k = 4: 9\n\n    # Pattern: 1, 2, 3, 5, 9 -> this looks like a Fibonacci-like sequence but starting from 1,2 and then each term is the sum of the previous two terms plus something.\n\n    # Check: \n    # 1, 2, 3 = 1+2, 5 = 2+3, 9 = 3+5+1? Not exactly.\n\n    # Alternatively, consider:\n    # k=0: 1\n    # k=1: 2\n    # k=2: 1 + 2 = 3\n    # k=3: 2 + 3 = 5\n    # k=4: 3 + 5 = 8? But the example for n=10 gives 4, meaning that with 10 players, the winner can play 4 games. Let's check the minimal players for 4 wins: 8? Then with 10 players, the winner can play 4 games because 8<=10.\n\n    # So the recurrence might be:\n    # g(k) = g(k-1) + g(k-2)\n    # with g(0)=1, g(1)=2.\n\n    # Then:\n    # g(2) = g(1) + g(0) = 2 + 1 = 3\n    # g(3) = g(2) + g(1) = 3 + 2 = 5\n    # g(4) = g(3) + g(2) = 5 + 3 = 8\n    # g(5) = 8 + 5 = 13\n\n    # Now, for n=10, the maximum k such that g(k) <= 10 is k=4 (since g(4)=8<=10, g(5)=13>10). The example says the answer for n=10 is 4, which matches.\n\n    # Also, for n=3: g(2)=3<=3 -> k=2, which is the expected answer.\n\n    # And for n=4: \n    # g(0)=1, g(1)=2, g(2)=3, g(3)=5 -> the maximum k for n=4 is 2 (since g(2)=3<=4 and g(3)=5>4). But the example input 4 gives output 2, which matches.\n\n    # Therefore, the recurrence is:\n    # g(0) = 1\n    # g(1) = 2\n    # g(k) = g(k-1) + g(k-2) for k>=2.\n\n    # Now, we need to find the maximum k such that g(k) <= n.\n\n    # Since n can be up to \\( 10^{18} \\), we cannot compute g(k) for large k by iterating from 0 upwards (as k would be about 100, which is manageable, but we can use a loop to compute g(k) until it exceeds n).\n\n    # Steps:\n    # 1. If n==2, print 1 (since g(1)=2<=2, but g(2)=3>2 -> k=1).\n    # 2. Otherwise, initialize two variables: a=1 (g(0)), b=2 (g(1)).\n    # 3. Start with k=1 (since g(1)=2) and then compute subsequent g(k) until g(k) > n.\n    # 4. The answer is the current k when we break.\n\n    # However, note that g(0)=1 is for k=0, but the winner must play at least one game (if n>=2) so we are interested in k>=1.\n\n    # But the problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner can play, which is k.\n\n    # Implementation:\n\n    a, b = 1, 2\n    k = 1\n    if n < 2:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        while b <= n:\n            # When we break, b is the first g(k) that exceeds n.\n            # But we need to advance k and update a, b.\n            # We start with k=1 (b=2) and then compute next value for k+1.\n            # Let's break the loop when b > n, then the answer is k (the last k for which g(k) <= n).\n            # But wait, in the loop condition we check b (which is g(k)) <= n, so we enter the loop for k=1, then update to k=2 and compute g(2)=3, then check if 3<=n, etc.\n            # We need to count the number of iterations.\n\n            # Actually, we want to keep track of k and update a and b for the next iteration.\n\n            # We are currently at k, with a = g(k-1) and b = g(k).\n            # For the next iteration, we want to compute g(k+1) = g(k) + g(k-1) = b + a.\n            # Then set a = b, b = b + a.\n\n            # But note: after the update, k becomes k+1.\n\n            # However, the loop condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration. We want to count the current k (which is the number of wins) and then continue.\n\n            # Let me restructure:\n\n            # We want to find the maximum k such that g(k) <= n.\n\n            # We start with k=0, g0=1; k=1, g1=2.\n            # Then for k>=2, gk = g(k-1) + g(k-2).\n\n            # We can do:\n\n            # k = 0: g0 = 1\n            # k = 1: g1 = 2\n            # Then we want to find the maximum k such that gk <= n.\n\n            # We can iterate from k=2 upwards until gk > n, counting k.\n\n            # But since we start the loop with k=1 and b=2, and the condition is b<=n, then we update to k=2 and compute g2=3, then check if 3<=n.\n\n            # So the code inside the loop should update k and the values of a and b.\n\n            # We already have k=1, and we want to compute k=2.\n\n            # We can do:\n\n            # Before the loop, we set:\n            # k = 1\n            # a = g(k-1) = 1, b = g(k) = 2\n\n            # Then the loop condition checks b<=n (i.e., g(1)<=n) -> true, so we enter.\n            # Then we update:\n            # k = k + 1 (now k=2)\n            # a = b (so a becomes 2, which is g(1))\n            # b = a + b_prev?

Answer=4.\n\n            # This matches the examples.\n\n            # So the plan is:\n            #   a = 1 (g0)\n            #   b = 2 (g1)\n            #   k = 1\n            #   while b <= n:\n            #       k += 1\n            #       a, b = b, a + b\n            #   Then print(k-1)\n\n            # But wait, in the loop we are updating k and then computing the next g(k).

Then the next iteration checks 3<=n.\n\n        # We need to count the current k (which is the number of wins) only if we are going to use it. Actually, we want the maximum k such that g(k)<=n.\n\n        # The variable k is the current index (starting at 1) and we update it at the beginning of the loop body.\n\n        # But note: the condition is on the current b (g(k)) and we update to g(k+1) at the end of the loop body.\n\n        # Actually, we want to find the maximum k for which g(k)<=n. The loop condition is g(k) <= n, and then we update to g(k+1) and increment k.\n\n        # Then when we break, the last k that satisfied the condition is k-1.\n\n        # But in the loop, we update k and then compute g(k+1). So after the update, k is now the next index, and b is g(k). Then the next condition is g(k)<=n.\n\n        # So to get the answer, we need to remember the last k for which g(k)<=n, which is k-1.\n\n        # However, in the example n=2:\n        #   Start: k=1, a=1, b=2 -> condition 2<=2 -> true.\n        #   Then k becomes 2, and b becomes 1+2=3, a becomes 2.\n        #   Then condition 3<=2 -> false, so we break.

Output 3-1=2.\n\n        # This is correct.\n\n        # But note: the initial condition sets k=1 and b=2. We must ensure that if n==1, we output 0? But the problem states n>=2.\n\n        # So the code is:\n\n        k += 1\n        a, b = b, a + b\n\n        # But wait, the above update is done once per iteration. However, the condition is checked at the beginning of the loop, so the first time we enter the loop, we are at k=1 and b=2. Then we update to k=2 and b=3. Then the next condition is on b=3.\n\n        # We need to break out of the loop when b > n, and then output k-1.\n\n    # However, the above update is inside the loop body, but we have a 'pass' statement.

Then we update to k=2 and compute g2=3. Then the next condition is g2=3<=n.\n\n    # This is correct.\n\n    # However, the initial state has k=1 and b=2.

Answer=5-1=4. Correct.\n\n    # Therefore, the code is:\n\n    # However, note that the initial k=1 corresponds to the first win. We are counting the wins by incrementing k at the beginning of the loop body and then computing the next g(k). \n\n    # But wait, the initial state has k=1 and b=2 (which is g(1)). We are not counting the initial state as a win? Actually, the initial state is the first win (k=1). Then we update to the next win (k=2) and so on.\n\n    # The answer is the number of wins, which is k-1 at the break.\n\n    # But note: the loop condition is checked for the current b (g(k)) and then we update to the next g(k) and increment k. This means that the value of k at the break is the next win number that would exceed n, so the last valid win count is k-1.\n\n    # However, the initial k=1 is the first win. We enter the loop and then update to k=2 (second win) and compute g(2). \n\n    # This is correct.\n\n    # But what if n=1? The problem states n>=2, so we don't handle n=1.\n\n    # We can now implement the loop.\n\n    # However, the initial code had a 'pass' and then broke out. We need to remove the pass and do the update.\n\n    # But note: the initial condition sets k=1, a=1, b=2. Then the loop condition checks b<=n.\n\n    # Let's write the loop properly.\n\n    # We'll use a while loop that continues as long as the current b (g(k)) is <= n.\n\n    # Inside the loop, we update k and the values of a and b.\n\n    # But note: we are updating k and then setting a and b for the next iteration.\n\n    # However, we want to count the wins. The variable k starts at 1 (first win) and we are going to compute the next win (k=2) in the first iteration.\n\n    # The answer is the number of wins, which is k-1 at the break.\n\n    # But wait, the initial k=1 is the first win, and we are about to compute the second win. Then the condition is on the first win's value (b=2) and we update to the second win.\n\n    # This is correct.\n\n    # We can now implement the loop.\n\n    # However, the above explanation is for the case where we start with k=1 and b=2. But the problem states that n>=2, so we don't need to handle n=1.\n\n    # Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n    # But note: the initial values are set for k=1 (one win). We want to find the maximum wins, so we start counting from win 1.\n\n    # The loop will break when the next win's player count exceeds n.\n\n    # However, the condition is checked at the beginning of the loop for the current win's player count. But wait, in the initial state, we are at win 1 with player count 2. We enter the loop, then update to win 2 and player count 3, then check if 3<=n.\n\n    # But the condition is on the current win's player count. So the condition is on the win we are about to leave (if we update, then we will have a new win). \n\n    # Actually, the condition is on the current b, which is the player count for the current win (k). We want to ensure that the current win's player count is <= n, then we can have a tournament with n players for that win, and then try for the next win.\n\n    # But the problem is asking for the maximum number of wins. So we want to find the largest k such that g(k) <= n.\n\n    # The loop condition is: while the current win's player count (g(k)) is <= n, then we can have k wins, and then we try for k+1.\n\n    # But note: the condition is checked at the beginning of the loop, and then we update to k+1 and compute g(k+1). Then the next condition is on g(k+1).\n\n    # This means that the loop will exit when g(k) > n, and the last win count we could achieve is k-1.\n\n    # However, the initial condition is for k=1 (g1=2). We enter the loop because 2<=n (given n>=2). Then we update to k=2 and g2=3, and then check if 3<=n. \n\n    # The loop continues until we find a win count k for which g(k) > n, then we output k-1.\n\n    # But note: the initial k=1 is included in the loop, and we are counting the wins by updating k at the beginning of the loop body.\n\n    # This is correct.\n\n    # However, the above code inside the loop was commented out. Let me uncomment and adjust.\n\n    # We'll remove the 'pass' and do:\n\n    # But note: the initial code had a 'pass' and then broke out. We need to replace the pass with the update.\n\n    # Since we are already in the loop, we can simply update the variables.\n\n    # Correction: The initial code had a 'pass' and then a comment. We need to remove the pass and do the update.\n\n    # Actually, the initial code structure was:\n\n    #   while b <= n:\n    #       pass\n\n    #   Then after the loop, print(k-1)\n\n    # But that would not work. We need to update the variables inside the loop.\n\n    # Let me restructure the code outside the loop.\n\n    # Since the problem is solved by the above logic, we'll implement:\n\n    a, b = 1, 2\n    k = 1\n    while b <= n:\n        k += 1\n        a, b = b, a + b\n\n    print(k-1)\n\n    # However, the initial code had a different structure. Let me run through the example n=2 with this code:\n\n    # n=2\n    # a=1, b=2, k=1 -> condition 2<=2 -> true.\n    # Then k=2, a=2, b=1+2=3.\n    # Then condition 3<=2 -> false, so break. Print 2-1=1.\n\n    # Correct.\n\n    # But wait, the initial condition sets a=1, b=2 for k=1. Then we enter the loop and update to k=2 and b=3. Then the condition fails.\n\n    # The answer is 1.\n\n    # This is correct.\n\n    # Now, let's run for n=3:\n    # a=1, b=2, k=1 -> true -> k=2, a=2, b=3 -> condition 3<=3 -> true -> k=3, a=3, b=5 -> condition 5<=3 -> false -> print 3-1=2.\n\n    # Correct.\n\n    # But note: the initial condition sets k=1 and b=2. The first win (k=1) requires 2 players, which is <=3, so we enter and then compute the second win (k=2) which requires 3 players, which is <=3, so we enter again and then compute the third win (k=3) which requires 5 players, which is >3, so we break and output 2.\n\n    # This is correct.\n\n    # However, note that the recurrence is g(k) = g(k-1) + g(k-2). This is the Fibonacci sequence starting from g0=1, g1=2.\n\n    # But the Fibonacci sequence usually starts from 0,1 or 1,1. This sequence is:\n    # k: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,...\n    # g(k):1,2,3,5,8,13,21,...\n\n    # This is a Fibonacci-like sequence.\n\n    # Given that n can be up to \\( 10^{18} \\), the loop will run at most about 90 times (since the Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially), which is efficient.\n\n    # Therefore, the final code is:\n\n    # Note: We assume n>=2.\n\n    # Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n    # Example inputs: [2,3,4,10]\n\n    # Expected outputs: [1,2,2,4]\n\n    # We'll run the code with these inputs.\n\n    # But wait, the example input 4 gives output 2, which matches.\n\n    # However, the example input 10 gives output 4, which matches.\n\n    # One more: n=1 -> not applicable.\n\n    # But the problem states n>=2.\n\n    # We'll submit the code.\n\n    # However, note: the initial code structure was different. We are now using a while loop that updates k and the Fibonacci-like sequence.\n\n    # But wait, the above code does not handle the case where n is very large (like \\( 10^{18} \\))? It does, because the loop runs in O(k) and k is logarithmic in n (base golden ratio), so it's efficient.\n\n    # Final code:\n\nexcept RecursionError:\n    # We are not using recursion, so this is just in case.\n    pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n    else:\n        a, b = 1, 2\n        k = 1\n        while b <= n:\n            k += 1\n            a, b = b, a + b\n        print(k-1)",
