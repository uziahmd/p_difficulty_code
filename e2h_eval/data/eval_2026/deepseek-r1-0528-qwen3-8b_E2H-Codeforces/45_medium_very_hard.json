There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\nWe are to find the maximum number of games the winner can take part in, given that two players can play only if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\nObservation:\nIn a knockout tournament, the total number of games is n-1 (each game eliminates one player until one remains). However, the winner must win all his games. But note: we are not required to eliminate all players, but we are allowed to arrange the grid arbitrarily as long as the rule holds.\n\nThe key is to maximize the number of games the winner plays. Let k be the number of games the winner plays. Then the winner must defeat k players (so there must be at least k other players). But note: the tournament has n players, and the winner must be one of them.\n\nHowever, the rule restricts the order: two players can play only if their previous game counts differ by at most one.\n\nWe can model the tournament as having rounds, but note: the rule allows for non-uniform bracket structures? Actually, the problem says \"the organizers are still arranging the grid\" but fixed the rule.\n\nLet us consider:\n\n- The winner must win k games. So we need at least 2^k players? Not necessarily, because we can have a structure that doesn't require full binary tree.\n\nBut note: the condition on the number of games played. The winner will have k wins (so k games). The next level players would have k-1, k-2, etc.\n\nActually, think of building the tournament backwards: the winner must have k wins. Then the players he beats must have fewer wins. However, the entire tournament must be arranged so that the condition holds.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider the following:\n\nWe can have a sequence of rounds. In the first round, we have some matches. Then the winners advance. But the rule says that when two players meet, their current numbers of games (i.e., wins) must differ by at most one.\n\nThis resembles a \"king of the hill\" structure with queues? \n\nActually, we can break the tournament into two halves? Or use a strategy where we build two groups: one with players that have played i games and the other with players that have played i+1 or i-1 games.\n\nBut note: the winner must be the one who started at the beginning (player 1) and won all his games.\n\nWe can consider a recursive structure or use mathematical formulation.\n\nLet f(n) be the maximum number of games the winner can play in a tournament with n players.\n\nConstraints:\n- The tournament is knockout, so we need to eliminate n-1 players.\n\nBut we are arranging the grid arbitrarily (as long as the rule holds) to maximize the winner's games.\n\nHow can we maximize the winner's games?\nWe want the winner to play as many games as possible. That means we want to have as many opponents as possible. But the rule restricts the order: the winner must face an opponent who has either the same or one less win.\n\nLet k be the number of wins for the winner.\n\nThen the tournament must have a structure such that the winner accumulates k wins. The players that the winner defeats must have been built from subtrees.\n\nBut note: the winner's path must satisfy that when he defeats a player, that player must have a certain number of wins. In particular, the first opponent (if any) must have 0 wins (since the winner starts with 0). Then the winner wins, now has 1 win. Then the next opponent must have either 0 or 1 wins. But wait, the next opponent must have at least 1 win (because the winner has 1, and the rule allows difference of at most 1, so the opponent must have 0 or 1). However, if we want to maximize the winner's games, we can design a structure that allows the winner to keep playing.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of the entire tournament as being divided into two parts: one part for the winner and one part for the rest.\n\nBut note: the problem is similar to the \"maximum chain\" in which the winner must beat k opponents, and each opponent must have been the winner of a sub-tournament of size at least 1, and then the next opponent must have a record (number of wins) that is at most one less than the winner's.\n\nActually, we can use a recursive approach:\n\nSuppose the winner plays k games. Then the tournament can be broken down as:\n\nRound 1: The winner plays his first game against a player who has 0 wins. This requires that the opponent is a leaf (so the opponent didn't play any game before).\n\nRound 2: The winner plays again. Now he has 1 win. The opponent must have 0 or 1 wins. But if we give the opponent 1 win, then that opponent must have beaten someone. So we need to have a sub-tournament of size 2 for that opponent.\n\nSimilarly, for the third game, the winner has 2 wins. The opponent must have 1 or 2 wins.\n\nBut note: we cannot have two different opponents with two wins because then the two opponents would have to come from separate sub-tournaments of size 4 (each) and then the winner would have to face one of them.\n\nWait, but the entire tournament must have n players. We are using one for the winner and then the rest are distributed.\n\nBut note: the winner is fixed. We are building the rest.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games.\n\nLet F(k) be the minimal number of players required so that the winner can have k wins.\n\nFor k=0: no games, just the winner -> 1 player.\n\nFor k>=1: \nThe winner must defeat k opponents. Each of these opponents must have been the winner of a sub-tournament. But the rule: when the winner (with k-1 wins) faces an opponent, the opponent must have either k-2 or k-1 wins (wait, let me re-index):\n\nActually, let the winner's wins be increasing. Before the first game: winner has 0 wins. The opponent must have 0 wins. So the opponent must be a single player (leaf). Then the winner has 1 win.\n\nBefore the second game: winner has 1 win. The opponent must have 0 or 1 wins. To minimize the total number of players, we might give the opponent 0 wins (so a leaf) and then the total for the second game is 2 players (the winner and the leaf). But wait, the opponent could have 1 win: then that opponent must have defeated one other player. So that would require 3 players (the opponent and the one he beat, plus the winner). \n\nBut we are trying to minimize the total number of players for k wins. So we choose the minimal option for each opponent.\n\nSo:\n\n- For the first opponent: 1 additional player (total for the first win: 1 + 1 = 2)\n- For the second opponent: we can choose a leaf (0 wins) -> 1 additional player (total: 2 + 1 = 3) OR an opponent with 1 win (then that opponent must have beaten one leaf, so 2 players) -> then total for the second win: 1 (the opponent) + 2 (his subtree) = 3, and then plus the winner's existing games? Actually, we are building the entire tree.\n\nBut note: the winner is already present, and we are adding the opponent and his subtree. So:\n\nk=0: 1\nk=1: 1 (winner) + 1 (opponent) = 2\nk=2: \n  Option 1: use a leaf for the second opponent: then total = 2 (from k=1) + 1 (the new leaf) = 3.\n  Option 2: use an opponent that has 1 win: then the opponent must have beaten one leaf, so the opponent's subtree has 2 players (the opponent and the leaf). Then total = 2 (from k=1) + 2 (the opponent's subtree) = 4.\n\nBut wait, the winner already has one win. The opponent for the second game must have either 0 or 1 wins. If we use a leaf (0 wins), then we add one new leaf. Then the total players is 3. Alternatively, if we use an opponent that has 1 win, we must have already built a tournament for that opponent (which took 2 players: the opponent and his one win). But note: the winner is already one player, and we are going to use that opponent from a subtree. However, the opponent must not be the same as the first opponent. So we are adding a whole new subtree of 2 players (the opponent and the leaf). Then the total becomes 1 (winner) + 1 (first opponent) [but wait, the first opponent was already used?] - no, actually the first opponent is already eliminated after the first game. \n\nWait, we must consider that the tournament is built from the beginning. Actually, we are building the entire bracket.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require the minimal number of players for k wins, but given n, what is the maximum k such that there exists a bracket with n players and the winner can have k wins.\n\nAlternatively, we can define:\n\nLet F(k) = minimal number of players required for the winner to have k wins.\n\nThen:\nF(0) = 1\nF(1) = 2\nFor k>=2, we have two possibilities for the last game (the k-th game):\n- The opponent has k-2 wins (then the opponent must have been the winner of a tournament that required F(k-2) players) but note: the opponent's tournament must be independent, and then we also need the opponent to have k-2 wins, meaning he won k-2 games. However, the winner of the entire tournament (our winner) is about to get his k-th win. But the opponent must have k-2 wins (so the opponent's subtree has F(k-2) players). Then the total players is: 1 (the winner) + F(k-1) (for the previous wins?) ... wait, no.\n\nActually, let's think:\n\nTo have k wins, the winner must have played k games. The k-th game is against an opponent who has either k-1 or k-2 wins (or more precisely, the condition is that the opponent's wins (w_opponent) must satisfy |w_winner - w_opponent| <= 1. At the k-th game, the winner has k-1 wins (before the k-th game). So the opponent must have either k-2, k-1, or k wins? Actually, no: the condition is at the time of the game, the opponent has a certain number of wins (say x). Then we require |(k-1) - x| <= 1, so x must be k-2, k-1, or k. But note: the opponent is about to lose, so his wins are from previous games. However, the problem states that the opponent must have already played x games (wins) and the winner has k-1.\n\nBut wait, the winner hasn't played the k-th game yet. So before the k-th game, the winner has k-1 wins. The opponent has x wins, and |(k-1) - x| <= 1.\n\nNow, how did the opponent get x wins? He must have won x games, so his entire subtree must have at least 2^x players? Not exactly, because the same rule applies.\n\nBut note: the entire tournament is built under the same rule. The opponent must have been the winner of a subtree that is built under the same rule.\n\nTherefore, to compute F(k): the minimal number of players to have a winner with k wins, we need:\n\n- The winner must have k wins, so he must have played k games. The k-th game is against an opponent with x wins (x = k-2, k-1, or k). But note: we want to minimize the total number of players, so we choose the minimal option.\n\nHowever, note that the opponent for the k-th game must be the winner of a subtree that has x wins (so that opponent must have x wins). Therefore, the minimal number of players for that opponent's subtree is F(x). Then the entire tournament would be:\n\n1 (the winner) + F(x) (the opponent's subtree) + (the rest of the bracket?) \n\nWait, but the winner must have won k-1 games already, so he must have defeated k-1 opponents. Each of those opponents must have been the winner of a subtree. And the k-th game is against a new opponent.\n\nBut note: the entire tournament is built from the winner and his k opponents, each opponent being the winner of a subtree. However, the rule requires that the opponent for the k-th game must have a win count within one of the winner's current win count (k-1). \n\nBut here's the catch: the winner's previous opponents must have been defeated when the winner had fewer wins. So the structure is:\n\n- The first opponent must have 0 wins (so a leaf, requiring 1 player).\n- The second opponent must have 0 or 1 wins. We choose 0 to minimize the total, so we use a leaf (1 player).\n- The third opponent must have 1 or 2 wins. We choose 1 win (minimal) so we use a subtree that gives 1 win (which requires F(1)=2 players).\n\nWait, but then the third opponent's subtree has 2 players (so one game). Then the total players for the winner to have 3 wins is:\n1 (winner) + 1 (first opponent) + 1 (second opponent) + 2 (third opponent's subtree) = 5.\n\nBut let me check:\n\nRound 1: winner (0 wins) vs leaf1 (0 wins) -> winner wins, now has 1 win, leaf1 eliminated.\nRound 2: winner (1 win) vs leaf2 (0 wins) -> winner wins, now has 2 wins, leaf2 eliminated.\nRound 3: winner (2 wins) vs opponent from a subtree of 2 players (so one game between two leaves, say leaf3 and leaf4). The winner of that subtree (say leaf3) has 1 win. Then the condition: |2-1|=1 -> allowed. Then the overall winner plays 3 games.\n\nTotal players: 1 (winner) + 1 (leaf1) + 1 (leaf2) + 2 (leaf3, leaf4) = 5.\n\nNow, if we choose for the third opponent to have 2 wins (so that he can be the winner of a subtree that requires F(2) players). Then F(2) = minimal players for a winner to have 2 wins. We don't know F(2) yet, but from above we computed F(3) as 5. Alternatively, we can define F(k) recursively.\n\nActually, we can define:\n\nLet F(k) be the minimal number of players needed to have a winner with k wins.\n\nThen, to achieve k wins, the winner must have played k games. The k-th game is against an opponent that has x wins, where x is either k-2, k-1, or k? Actually, the condition is |(k-1) - x| <= 1, so x can be k-2, k-1, or k.\n\nBut note: the opponent must have been the winner of a subtree. The minimal way to get an opponent with x wins is to use F(x) players. However, we are building the entire tournament: the winner and his k opponents. But wait, the k opponents must be distinct and each from a distinct subtree.\n\nBut note: the entire tournament must have:\n\n1 (the main winner) + sum_{i=1}^{k} (size of the i-th opponent's subtree)\n\nBut the i-th opponent's subtree must be built under the same rule, and the i-th opponent must have a certain number of wins (x_i) that satisfies |(i-1) - x_i| <= 1 (because the winner has i-1 wins before the i-th game). However, we are free to choose the structure of the opponent's subtree as long as the rule holds.\n\nBut to minimize the total players, we choose for each opponent the minimal number of players (i.e., the minimal F(x_i)) such that |(i-1) - x_i| <= 1.\n\nBut note: the opponent's wins (x_i) must be the total wins the opponent had in his own subtree. How do we relate x_i to the structure? The opponent must have won x_i games, so his entire subtree must have at least F(x_i) players (and the opponent is the winner of that subtree).\n\nMoreover, the condition for the i-th game is that |(i-1) - x_i| <= 1.\n\nNow, to minimize the total, we choose the smallest x_i that satisfies the condition and minimizes F(x_i). Since F is increasing (more wins require more players), we should choose the smallest x_i that is allowed (so x_i = i-2, i-1, or i) but we want to minimize the number of players, so we choose the smallest x_i that is >= (i-2) and satisfies |(i-1)-x_i|<=1. Actually, the allowed x_i are {i-2, i-1, i} but note: i-2 might be negative, so we take max(0, i-2) to i.\n\nBut note: for the first game (i=1): \nCondition: |0 - x_1| <= 1 -> x_1 in {0,1}. We choose x_1=0 (minimal) and F(0)=1.\n\nFor the second game (i=2):\nCondition: |1 - x_2| <= 1 -> x_2 in {0,1,2}. We choose x_2=0 (minimal) and F(0)=1.\n\nBut wait, that would give for the second game: the opponent has 0 wins, so a leaf. Then the total players for two wins is 1 (winner) + 1 (first opponent) + 1 (second opponent) = 3.\n\nBut earlier I thought for two wins we can also use an opponent with 1 win (then total 4). So the minimal for two wins is 3.\n\nHowever, the example input: \nInput: 4 -> Output: 2\n\nSo if n=4, the answer is 2. That means that with 4 players, the winner can have at most 2 wins.\n\nBut according to our minimal construction:\n\nFor k=0: 1 player -> n>=1\nFor k=1: 2 players -> n>=2\nFor k=2: 3 players -> n>=3\nFor k=3: 5 players -> n>=5\n\nSo for n=4, we can only have up to 2 wins (since 3 players is the minimal for 2 wins, so 4>=3 -> yes, but wait: the minimal for 3 wins is 5, so 4<5 -> so we cannot have 3 wins). Then the maximum wins is 2.\n\nBut wait, in the example: \nInput: 4 -> Output: 2\n\nAnd for n=10, output=4.\n\nSo the problem: given n, find the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\nBut note: the minimal number of players for k wins is F(k). Then we want the maximum k with F(k) <= n.\n\nNow, we need to compute F(k) for k from 0 up to ... until we exceed n (which is up to 10**18). \n\nHow to compute F(k)? \n\nWe have:\nF(0) = 1\nF(1) = 2\nF(2) = 1 + F(0) + F(0) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3   [But wait, we have two opponents: the first two games both use a leaf (0 wins). Then the total is 1 (winner) + 1 (first opponent) + 1 (second opponent) = 3]\n\nBut wait, the winner's two opponents are two separate leaves. Then the entire tournament has 3 players: the winner and two others. So yes, 3.\n\nBut then for k=3: \nThe third game: the winner has 2 wins (before the third game) -> condition: opponent must have 1,2, or 3 wins. We choose the minimal, so x=1 (win count). Then the opponent's subtree must have F(1)=2 players.\n\nTotal players = 1 (winner) + F(1) (for the third opponent) + (the two previous opponents, each F(0)=1) -> 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\nBut wait, we have three opponents. The first two are leaves (1 player each) and the third is a subtree of 2 players. So total players = 1 (winner) + 1 (first) + 1 (second) + 2 (third) = 5.\n\nBut note: the entire tournament must have distinct players. So the winner and the four others (two from the two leaves and two from the third opponent's subtree) -> total 5.\n\nNow, the recurrence:\n\nLet F(0) = 1\nFor k>=1, the k-th game (the k-th win) requires an opponent with x wins (x must be in {k-2, k-1, k} and we choose the smallest x that is nonnegative). Then the total players is:\n\nF(k) = 1 + F(k-1) + F(k-2)   ??? \n\nWait, no. Because the k-th game is against an opponent that has x wins (we choose x = k-2, k-1, or k). To minimize, we choose the smallest x that is allowed and for which F(x) is defined. However, note that the entire tournament includes the winner and the k opponents, but the opponents themselves must have their own subtrees.\n\nActually, the minimal structure for k wins is built by:\n\n- The winner must have k wins, so he must have k opponents (each from a distinct subtree).\n- For the i-th opponent (defeated in the i-th game), the minimal number of players in his subtree is F(x_i) where x_i is chosen as the smallest integer >= (i-2) and satisfying |(i-1) - x_i| <= 1.\n\nBut note: the condition for the i-th game is |(i-1) - x_i| <= 1, and we choose x_i as small as possible (to minimize the total players). The smallest x_i that satisfies |(i-1)-x_i|<=1 is max(0, i-2) (because i-2 might be negative, then we use 0). But wait, for i=1: x_1 = max(0, 1-2)=0, which is correct. For i=2: x_2 = max(0, 2-2)=0, which is correct. For i=3: x_3 = max(0, 3-2)=1, which is correct. For i=4: x_4 = max(0,4-2)=2, then condition: |3-2|=1 -> okay.\n\nBut then the total players is:\n\nF(k) = 1 + sum_{i=1}^{k} F(x_i)\n\nBut note: the subtrees for the opponents must be disjoint. And the entire tournament has the winner and the players from all the subtrees.\n\nSo:\n\nF(0) = 1\nFor k>=1, \n   x_k = max(0, k-2)   [the smallest x that satisfies |(k-1)-x|<=1] \n   Then F(k) = 1 + F(x_k) + [what?] \n\nWait, no: the winner is one player, and then we have k opponents. Each opponent comes with his entire subtree. The subtree for the i-th opponent has F(x_i) players (if we let the opponent have x_i wins). But note: the entire subtree for the i-th opponent must have F(x_i) players, and the opponent is included in that.\n\nBut the winner is separate. So the total number of players is:\n\nF(k) = 1 + sum_{i=1}^{k} F(x_i)\n\nBut note: the x_i for the i-th opponent is chosen as x_i = max(0, i-2). \n\nLet's verify:\n\nk=1: \n   x_1 = max(0,1-2)=0\n   F(1) = 1 + F(0) = 1+1 = 2 -> correct.\n\nk=2:\n   x_1 = 0, x_2 = max(0,2-2)=0\n   F(2) = 1 + F(0) + F(0) = 1+1+1 = 3 -> correct.\n\nk=3:\n   x_1=0, x_2=0, x_3=1\n   F(3) = 1 + F(0)+F(0)+F(1) = 1+1+1+2 = 5 -> correct.\n\nk=4:\n   x_1=0, x_2=0, x_3=1, x_4=2\n   F(4) = 1 + F(0)+F(0)+F(1)+F(2) = 1+1+1+2+3 = 8\n\nBut wait, the example: n=10 -> output=4. So with 10 players, the winner can have 4 wins.\n\nIndeed, F(4)=8 <=10, so 4 wins is achievable.\n\nBut what about k=5?\n\nk=5: \n   x_1=0, x_2=0, x_3=1, x_4=2, x_5=3\n   F(5)=1 + F(0)+F(0)+F(1)+F(2)+F(3) = 1+1+1+2+3+5 = 13\n\nSo for n=10, 10 < 13 -> maximum k is 4.\n\nBut wait, the example input 10 gives output 4.\n\nSo the solution is: find the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\nBut note: the minimal number of players for k wins is F(k). Then we want the largest k with F(k) <= n.\n\nHowever, note: the recurrence is:\n\nF(0) = 1\nFor k>=1: \n   x_k = max(0, k-2)\n   F(k) = 1 + F(0) + F(0) + ... (for the first k-1 terms) but wait, no: we have to sum over i=1 to k the F(x_i) and then add 1.\n\nBut note: the x_i depends on i. Specifically, for the i-th opponent (i from 1 to k) we set x_i = max(0, i-2). \n\nThen:\n\nF(0) = 1\nF(1) = 1 + F(0) = 2\nF(2) = 1 + F(0) + F(0) = 3\nF(3) = 1 + F(0)+F(0)+F(1) = 5\nF(4) = 1 + F(0)+F(0)+F(1)+F(2) = 1+1+1+2+3 = 8\nF(5) = 1 + F(0)+F(0)+F(1)+F(2)+F(3) = 1+1+1+2+3+5 = 13\nF(6) = 1 + F(0)+F(0)+F(1)+F(2)+F(3)+F(4) = 1+1+1+2+3+5+8 = 22\n\nThis sequence looks familiar: it is the Fibonacci numbers.\n\nLet me check:\n\nF(0)=1, F(1)=2, F(2)=3, F(3)=5, F(4)=8, F(5)=13, F(6)=21? Wait, 1+1+1+2+3+5+8 = 21? Actually, 1+1+1+2+3+5+8 = 21, but I wrote 22 above. Let me recalc:\n\nF(6) = 1 + F(0) + F(0) + F(1) + F(2) + F(3) + F(4)\n= 1 + 1 (for i=1: x_1=0) + 1 (for i=2: x_2=0) + 2 (for i=3: x_3=1) + 3 (for i=4: x_4=2) + 5 (for i=5: x_5=3) + 8 (for i=6: x_6=4? Wait, no: for i=6, x_6 = max(0,6-2)=4, so we need F(4)=8.\n\nBut wait, the recurrence for F(6) uses the x_i for i from 1 to 6: \ni=1: x_1 = max(0,1-2)=0 -> F(0)=1\ni=2: x_2 = 0 -> F(0)=1\ni=3: x_3=1 -> F(1)=2\ni=4: x_4=2 -> F(2)=3\ni=5: x_5=3 -> F(3)=5\ni=6: x_6=4 -> F(4)=8\n\nThen F(6)=1 + 1+1+2+3+5+8 = 21.\n\nBut note: the Fibonacci sequence is defined as:\nfib0=0, fib1=1, fib2=1, fib3=2, fib4=3, fib5=5, fib6=8, fib7=13, fib8=21.\n\nOur sequence: \nk:   0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6\nF(k):1,  2,  3,  5,  8, 13, 21\n\nWhich is similar to Fibonacci but shifted.\n\nActually, if we define:\nG(k) = F(k)   [our function]\n\nThen G(0)=1, G(1)=2, and for k>=2, G(k)=G(k-1)+G(k-2)\n\nBut wait, G(2)=3 = G(1)+G(0)=2+1=3 -> yes.\nG(3)=5 = G(2)+G(1)=3+2=5 -> yes.\nG(4)=8 = G(3)+G(2)=5+3=8 -> yes.\n\nSo G(k) is the Fibonacci sequence starting from:\n\nindex: 0 -> 1\nindex: 1 -> 2\nindex: 2 -> 3\nindex: 3 -> 5\n\nWhich is the Fibonacci sequence (starting at index0=1, index1=2) then index2=3, index3=5, index4=8, ...\n\nBut note: the standard Fibonacci sequence (with F0=0, F1=1) is:\n\nn: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\nFib:0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21\n\nOur G(k) for k>=0:\nG(0)=1 -> corresponds to Fib(3)=2? No.\n\nActually, we can write:\n\nG(k) = Fib(k+2)   if we define Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, Fib(7)=13, Fib(8)=21.\n\nThen:\nG(0)= Fib(2)=1 -> yes.\nG(1)= Fib(3)=2 -> yes.\nG(2)= Fib(4)=3 -> yes.\nG(3)= Fib(5)=5 -> yes.\n\nBut wait, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, Fib(7)=13, Fib(8)=21.\n\nSo G(k) = Fib(k+2)\n\nBut note: the standard definition of Fibonacci sometimes uses Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, ... so Fib(n) is the nth Fibonacci number.\n\nThen we have: F(k) = Fib(k+2)\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum k such that Fib(k+2) <= n.\n\nBut note: n can be up to 10**18. We cannot iterate k from 0 to ... until Fib(k+2)>n because k can be around 100 (since Fib grows exponentially, and Fib(100) is huge, but 10**18 is about Fib(90) to Fib(100)).\n\nSo we can generate Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Read n (as integer)\n2. We know that k=0 -> F(0)=1, k=1->2, etc.\n3. We want the maximum k such that Fib(k+2) <= n.\n\nBut note: the minimal players for k wins is F(k)=Fib(k+2). So we need to find the maximum k for which Fib(k+2) <= n.\n\nBut note: k is the number of wins. We are counting k from 0 upwards.\n\nExample: \nn=2 -> k=1 (because Fib(1+2)=Fib(3)=2 <=2, and Fib(4)=3>2 -> so k=1)\n\nn=3 -> k=2 (because Fib(2+2)=Fib(4)=3<=3, and Fib(5)=5>3 -> k=2)\n\nn=4 -> k=2 (because Fib(4)=3<=4, Fib(5)=5>4 -> k=2)\n\nBut wait, the example input 4 gives output 2, which matches.\n\nn=10 -> Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, Fib(7)=13 -> so maximum k such that Fib(k+2)<=10 is k=5? \n\nWait, let me map:\n\nk=0 -> Fib(2)=1\nk=1 -> Fib(3)=2\nk=2 -> Fib(4)=3\nk=3 -> Fib(5)=5\nk=4 -> Fib(6)=8\nk=5 -> Fib(7)=13\n\nSo for n=10, k=4 is the maximum (because Fib(6)=8<=10, but Fib(7)=13>10). So k=4.\n\nBut wait, the example input 10 gives output 4.\n\nSo the answer is k, the number of wins.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Print the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in\"\n\nEach game the winner plays is a win, so the number of wins is the number of games. So we output k.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious: the recurrence F(k)=Fib(k+2) is defined for k>=0.\n\nBut note: the Fibonacci numbers grow as O(2^k). So for k up to about 100, we can generate the Fibonacci sequence until we exceed n.\n\nAlgorithm:\n\nWe'll generate Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n. Then the index k+2 is the last one <= n.\n\nBut note: our F(k)=Fib(k+2). So if we let:\n\nfib[0] = 0\nfib[1] = 1\nfib[2] = 1\nfib[3] = 2\n...\n\nBut we don't need the entire array, we can iterate.\n\nSteps:\n\n- Initialize:\n   a = 0, b = 1   (a=fib0, b=fib1)\n   But we need to start from Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, etc.\n\nAlternatively, we can iterate by:\n\nLet k = 0, and we want to compute F(k)=Fib(k+2). We can generate Fibonacci numbers and count the index.\n\nBut note: we are given n, and we want the maximum k such that Fib(k+2) <= n.\n\nWe can do:\n\ncount = 0   # This will be k (the number of wins)\na, b = 1, 1  # These are Fib(1) and Fib(2) if we start from 0-indexed? \n\nWait, we have:\n\nFib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, ...\n\nWe need Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, ...\n\nSo if we set:\n   fib0 = 0\n   fib1 = 1\nThen Fib(2)=fib1+fib0=1, Fib(3)=fib2+fib1=1+1=2, Fib(4)=fib3+fib2=2+1=3, etc.\n\nBut we are interested in the index = k+2.\n\nWe can generate:\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by no more than one. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament follows a knockout format where each loss eliminates a player. The challenge is to arrange the tournament such that the winner plays as many games as possible while adhering to the given rule. The key observation is that the minimal number of players required for the winner to play `k` games follows a Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, the minimal number of players needed for `k` wins is the `(k+2)`-th Fibonacci number.\n\n2. **Insight**: The solution involves finding the largest `k` such that the `(k+2)`-th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to the given number of players `n`. This is because each Fibonacci number in this sequence represents the minimal number of players required for the winner to achieve `k` wins under the tournament's constraints.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We generate Fibonacci numbers iteratively until we find the largest Fibonacci number that does not exceed `n`. The index of this Fibonacci number minus two gives the maximum number of games the winner can play. This approach efficiently handles large values of `n` (up to \\(10^{18}\\)) by leveraging the exponential growth property of Fibonacci numbers.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in \\(O(\\log n)\\) time because Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, so the loop terminates after approximately \\(\\log_{\\phi} n\\) iterations, where \\(\\phi\\) is the golden ratio. This makes the solution efficient even for very large `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    a, b = 0, 1\n    count = 0\n    fib_index = 0\n    \n    while b <= n:\n        a, b = b, a + b\n        fib_index += 1\n        \n    k = fib_index - 2\n    print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: If there's only one player (`n = 1`), the winner doesn't play any games, so the answer is `0`.\n2. **Fibonacci Generation**: The code initializes two variables `a` and `b` to 0 and 1, respectively, representing the first two Fibonacci numbers. It then iteratively generates each subsequent Fibonacci number by updating these variables.\n3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as the current Fibonacci number (`b`) is less than or equal to `n`. The loop counter (`fib_index`) keeps track of the position in the Fibonacci sequence.\n4. **Result Calculation**: Once the loop exits, the result is derived by subtracting 2 from `fib_index`, which gives the maximum number of games the winner can play. This is because the minimal number of players for `k` wins is the `(k+2)`-th Fibonacci number, so `k` is `fib_index - 2`.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the properties of Fibonacci numbers to solve the problem within logarithmic time complexity, making it suitable for very large input sizes.",
