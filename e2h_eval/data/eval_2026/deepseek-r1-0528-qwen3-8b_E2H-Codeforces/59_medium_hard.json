    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem.\n\nWe are given two integers N and K. We need to count the number of arrays [S1, S2, ..., SN] of sets (each set contains distinct integers from 1 to K) such that there exists a rearrangement [S'_1, S'_2, ..., S'_N] satisfying:\n  S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1} for each i from 1 to N-1.\n\nWhat does it mean for S'_i to be a child of S'_{i+1}?\n  For every element x in S'_i, there must be an element x+1 in S'_{i+1}.\n\nNote: The sets can only contain integers from 1 to K.\n\nWe can think of the entire array as being arranged in a sequence where each set \"points\" to the next by having each of its elements x requiring x+1 in the next set.\n\nObservation:\nSince we can rearrange arbitrarily, we are allowed to choose any permutation of the N sets. Therefore, the condition is that there exists a cyclic arrangement? Actually, note: the condition is for consecutive sets (from i to i+1) in the rearranged array. But note: the condition must hold for all consecutive pairs in the linear arrangement (which is fixed once we choose the order). However, note that the problem says \"there exists a rearrangement\", so we can choose the order arbitrarily.\n\nBut note: the condition must hold for the entire chain. So we have a sequence of sets S'_1, S'_2, ... , S'_N such that:\n  S'_1 is a child of S'_2, S'_2 is a child of S'_3, ... , S'_{N-1} is a child of S'_N.\n\nMoreover, the array is defined by N sets, but the same set might appear multiple times? However, note that the sets are defined by distinct integers from 1 to K, but they can repeat in the array? Actually, the problem says: \"Each set can only contain zero or more different integers from 1 to K\", and two sets are different if one has an element that the other doesn't. So sets can be repeated? But note: the condition for being a child is about the presence of the next element. However, note that the same set can appear multiple times, but the condition for the entire chain must hold.\n\nBut note: the problem allows rearranging arbitrarily. So we are free to assign which set is first, which is second, etc.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of the entire collection of sets as a multiset of N sets. Then we require that there is a permutation of these N sets such that the condition holds.\n\nHowever, note: the problem says \"different arrays of sets\", meaning that the array is ordered. But the condition requires that we can rearrange the array arbitrarily. So we are counting multisets of N sets (but note: the array is ordered, so order matters, but we can rearrange arbitrarily to satisfy the condition) and then we have to account for the fact that the condition must hold for some permutation.\n\nBut note: the problem does not say that the sets are distinct. They can repeat. However, the condition for being a child does not depend on the set being distinct, but on the elements.\n\nLet's reframe:\n\nWe are going to have N sets (each set is a subset of {1,2,...,K}) and we can arrange them arbitrarily. Then we require that there is an ordering [S'_1, S'_2, ..., S'_N] such that for each i, S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}.\n\nThis condition is equivalent to saying that the entire collection of sets must form a chain (or a cycle? no, because we have a linear chain of length N) of sets with the child property.\n\nBut note: the chain condition is directional. However, we are allowed to rearrange arbitrarily. So we can assign the sets to positions arbitrarily.\n\nActually, we can consider building a directed graph on the sets: an edge from set A to set B if and only if A is a child of B. Then we are counting the number of multisets of N sets that have a directed path (or actually a directed walk) of length N-1 (with N nodes, so the walk uses each node exactly once? Or wait, the problem does not say that the sets must be distinct. So we can have repeated sets.\n\nBut note: the condition must hold for consecutive sets. However, if we have the same set appearing twice, then the condition from the set to itself: for each x in A, we require that x+1 is in A. So the set must be closed under the operation x->x+1 (at least for the elements that are present). \n\nHowever, we are allowed to use the same set multiple times. So we are counting sequences of sets (with repetition allowed) that form a chain (in some order) of length N.\n\nBut note: the condition must hold for consecutive sets in the chain. Since we can rearrange arbitrarily, we are effectively counting the number of ways to choose a multiset of N sets and then arrange them in a chain (a directed path) that satisfies the child condition.\n\nWait, but note: the condition is that the entire multiset must have at least one chain of length N (using the sets in the multiset, and allowing repetition? Actually, no: the multiset may have duplicates, but we cannot use a set more than the number of times it appears? Actually, we are given an array of N sets. Then we are allowed to rearrange arbitrarily, so we can use each set as many times as it appears.\n\nSo we have a multiset of N sets (each set is a subset of {1..K}), and we want to know whether we can arrange them (order matters) such that for consecutive sets S_i and S_{i+1}: for every x in S_i, x+1 is in S_{i+1}. But note: we are allowed to rearrange arbitrarily, so we can also use the same set multiple times if it appears multiple times.\n\nBut note: the array is of fixed size N. Each set in the array is chosen independently? Actually, no: the condition requires that the entire collection of sets (the multiset) can be arranged in a chain.\n\nHowever, the problem does not require that the sets are distinct. So we can have duplicate sets.\n\nBut note: the example input \"2 2\" gives 11 arrays. The example lists 11 arrays.\n\nLet me list the sets that appear: \n  {} : empty set\n  {1}, {2}\n  {1,2}\n\nSo the sets are subsets of {1,2}. There are 4 sets: {}, {1}, {2}, {1,2}. But note: the array has two sets. The total number of arrays without any condition is 4^2 = 16. But the answer is 11, so 5 arrays are invalid.\n\nWhich arrays are invalid?\n\nThe condition: there must exist an arrangement [S1, S2] such that S1 is a child of S2.\n\nInvalid arrays are those for which no matter how we arrange the two sets, the condition fails.\n\nCondition for two sets A and B: either we arrange as [A, B] then A must be a child of B, or [B, A] then B must be a child of A.\n\nSo an array [A, B] is invalid if neither (A is a child of B) nor (B is a child of A) holds.\n\nBut note: the problem does not fix the order, so we can choose the order arbitrarily.\n\nTherefore, an array (multiset) is valid if at least one of the two orders (if the two sets are distinct) or if the same set is used twice then we require that the set is a child of itself (i.e., for every x in the set, x+1 is in the set).\n\nSo for two identical sets {A}: then we require A is a child of A.\n\nNow, let's check the sets:\n\n{}: trivially, since there is no x, so the condition holds.\n\n{1}: for {1} to be a child of {1}: we require 2 is in {1} -> fails. So {1} is not a child of itself.\n\n{2}: similarly, requires 3 is in {2}; but K=2, so 3 is not allowed. So {2} is not a child of itself.\n\n{1,2}: requires for 1: 2 is present; for 2: 3 is present -> 3 is not in {1,2} (since K=2) -> fails.\n\nSo the only set that is a child of itself is the empty set.\n\nNow, let's list the arrays of two sets (each set from the four possibilities) and check:\n\n1. [ {}, {} ]: both orders are [first {} then {}] and [first {} then {}] -> condition holds (since empty set is child of any set, and any set is child of empty set? Actually, note: the condition for empty set: for every x in {} (there are none) -> true. Also, for a set A to be a child of {}? No: the condition is for the set A to be a child of the next set. In the arrangement [A, B]: we require A is child of B. In the arrangement [B, A]: we require B is child of A.\n\nBut note: the condition is one-way. The empty set is a child of any set, because the condition is vacuously true. However, a non-empty set is a child of another set only if the next set contains all the next numbers.\n\nIn the array [ {}, {} ]: we can arrange as [ {}, {} ] and the condition holds (because {} is child of {}). So this is valid.\n\nSimilarly, [ {}, {1} ]: we can arrange as [ {}, {1} ] -> condition holds (because {} is child of {1}). Alternatively, [ {1}, {} ]: then {1} must be a child of {} -> fails because {1} has 1 and {} does not have 2. So we must use the arrangement [ {}, {1} ]. But note: the problem says \"there exists\" a rearrangement. So [ {}, {1} ] is valid.\n\nSimilarly, [ {1}, {} ] is not valid because the only arrangement that would work is [ {}, {1} ] but we don't have two {}? Actually, wait: the array [ {1}, {} ] is a multiset with two sets: one {1} and one {}. Then we can rearrange arbitrarily. The condition requires that we can arrange so that the first set is a child of the second. The two arrangements are:\n  [ {1}, {} ]: condition fails (because {1} is not a child of {})\n  [ {}, {1} ]: condition holds (because {} is a child of {1})\n\nSo the array [ {1}, {} ] is valid because we can rearrange to [ {}, {1} ].\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"Two arrays of sets are considered different if and only if there is at least one index i such that the sets at index i in the two arrays are different.\"\n\nSo [ {1}, {} ] and [ {}, {1} ] are two different arrays. However, the condition for the array [ {1}, {} ] is satisfied because we can rearrange arbitrarily. But note: the problem does not require that the array is already in the correct order. It requires that there exists a rearrangement.\n\nTherefore, we are counting the arrays (ordered by the fixed index) but then we are allowed to rearrange arbitrarily. However, the condition is independent of the initial order: we are allowed to assign the sets arbitrarily to the indices.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"There exists a way to rearrange the order of the array of sets into [S'_1, S'_2, ... , S'_N]\"\n\nSo the array we output is fixed, but we can reorder the sets arbitrarily to form a chain. Therefore, the condition is: the multiset of sets must be able to form a chain (of length N) by arranging them appropriately.\n\nThen the problem reduces to: Count the number of multisets (with N elements) of subsets of {1,...,K} such that the multiset can be arranged in a sequence [S_1, S_2, ..., S_N] with S_i being a child of S_{i+1} for all i.\n\nBut note: the array is ordered, but we are allowed to rearrange arbitrarily. So the same multiset can appear in many different orders. However, the problem counts different arrays (ordered sequences) as different if the sets at some index differ.\n\nWait, but note: the problem says \"each set can only contain zero or more different integers from 1 to K\". And the sets are defined by their elements. Then the array is an ordered sequence of N sets.\n\nBut then we are allowed to rearrange arbitrarily. So the condition is that the multiset of sets (ignoring order) must be able to form a chain.\n\nHowever, the answer for (2,2) is 11, and the total number of arrays (without condition) is 4^2 = 16. The invalid arrays are 16 - 11 = 5.\n\nWhat are the 5 invalid arrays? They must be arrays that cannot be rearranged to form a chain.\n\nFor two sets, the condition is that the multiset {A, B} must satisfy that either A is a child of B or B is a child of A (or both). \n\nLet's list the 16 arrays:\n\n1. [ {}, {} ] -> valid\n2. [ {}, {1} ] -> valid\n3. [ {}, {2} ] -> valid\n4. [ {}, {1,2}] -> valid\n5. [ {1}, {} ] -> valid\n6. [ {1}, {1} ] -> Check: can we arrange? \n      Arrangement 1: [ {1}, {1} ]: condition: {1} is a child of {1}? -> fails (as above). \n      Arrangement 2: [ {1}, {1} ] is the same. So no, fails. -> invalid.\n7. [ {1}, {2} ] -> Check: \n      Arrangement 1: [ {1}, {2} ]: condition: {1} is a child of {2}? -> requires 2 in {2} -> yes. So valid.\n      Arrangement 2: [ {2}, {1} ]: condition: {2} is a child of {1}? -> requires 3 in {1} -> no. But we don't need to use that arrangement because we found one. So valid.\n8. [ {1}, {1,2} ] -> \n      Arrangement 1: [ {1}, {1,2} ]: condition: {1} is a child of {1,2} -> yes (2 is in {1,2})\n      Arrangement 2: [ {1,2}, {1} ]: condition: {1,2} is a child of {1} -> requires 2 in {1} and 3 in {1} -> fails. But since arrangement 1 works, valid.\n9. [ {2}, {} ] -> valid (because we can arrange as [ {}, {2} ]: then {} is child of {2} -> true)\n10. [ {2}, {1} ] -> \n        Arrangement 1: [ {2}, {1} ]: condition: {2} is a child of {1} -> fails (requires 3 in {1})\n        Arrangement 2: [ {1}, {2} ]: condition: {1} is a child of {2} -> holds (as above). So valid.\n11. [ {2}, {2} ] -> \n        Arrangement 1: [ {2}, {2} ]: condition: {2} is a child of {2} -> fails (requires 3 in {2})\n        Arrangement 2: same. -> invalid.\n12. [ {2}, {1,2} ] -> \n        Arrangement 1: [ {2}, {1,2} ]: condition: {2} is a child of {1,2} -> requires 3 in {1,2} -> fails (K=2, so no 3) -> invalid? \n        Arrangement 2: [ {1,2}, {2} ]: condition: {1,2} is a child of {2} -> requires for 1: 2 is in {2} (yes), for 2: 3 is in {2} (no) -> fails. So invalid.\n13. [ {1,2}, {} ] -> valid (arrange as [ {}, {1,2} ]: condition holds)\n14. [ {1,2}, {1} ] -> valid (arrange as [ {1}, {1,2} ]: condition holds)\n15. [ {1,2}, {2} ] -> \n        Arrangement 1: [ {1,2}, {2} ]: condition: {1,2} is a child of {2} -> fails (needs 3)\n        Arrangement 2: [ {2}, {1,2} ]: condition: {2} is a child of {1,2} -> fails (needs 3) -> invalid.\n16. [ {1,2}, {1,2} ] -> \n        Condition: [ {1,2}, {1,2} ]: condition: {1,2} is a child of {1,2} -> fails (needs 3). \n        Only arrangement: invalid.\n\nWait, but we have 16 arrays. According to our listing, the invalid ones are:\n   [ {1}, {1} ] -> 6\n   [ {2}, {2} ] -> 11\n   [ {2}, {1,2} ] -> 12\n   [ {1,2}, {2} ] -> 15\n   [ {1,2}, {1,2} ] -> 16\n\nBut wait, 16 arrays: the indices are from 0 to 15? Actually, the sets are chosen independently for two positions, so we have 4 choices for the first and 4 for the second, so 16.\n\nBut the example output is 11, so we have 5 invalid. Our listing above has 5 invalid: 6,11,12,15,16. But wait, I listed 5: [ {1},{1} ], [ {2},{2} ], [ {2},{1,2} ], [ {1,2},{2} ], [ {1,2},{1,2} ].\n\nHowever, wait: [ {2}, {1,2} ] (index 12) and [ {1,2}, {2} ] (index 15) are two separate arrays, and [ {2},{1,2} ] was checked and found invalid, and [ {1,2},{2} ] was checked and found invalid. Similarly, [ {1},{1} ] and [ {2},{2} ] are invalid, and [ {1,2},{1,2} ] is invalid.\n\nBut note: the array [ {1}, {1} ] is two sets, both {1}. Similarly for others.\n\nSo the invalid arrays are the ones that have two identical sets that are not the empty set (and even for empty set, two empty sets is valid). Also, the array [ {2}, {1,2} ] and [ {1,2},{2} ] are invalid.\n\nBut wait, what about [ {1,2}, {1} ]? That was valid.\n\nNow, let's try to generalize.\n\nWe are to count the number of multisets (with N sets, but note: the array is ordered, however the condition is independent of order and we are allowed to rearrange arbitrarily) of subsets of {1..K} such that the multiset can be arranged in a chain.\n\nBut note: the problem counts arrays (ordered sequences). However, the condition is that the multiset (the unordered collection) must be able to form a chain. But the same multiset can appear in many different orders. However, note: the problem does not ask for the number of multisets, but the number of arrays (ordered sequences). \n\nWait, the problem says: \"Print the answer modulo 998244353.\"\n\nBut note: the example: for N=2, K=2, the answer is 11.\n\nHow do we count the arrays? \n\nWe are counting arrays [S1, S2, ..., SN] (each Si is a subset of {1..K}) such that there exists a permutation (rearrangement) of these N sets that forms a chain.\n\nBut note: the condition is independent of the order. However, the same multiset (unordered) might be arranged in multiple ways. But the problem counts two arrays as different if at least one index has a different set.\n\nBut note: the condition is: \"there exists a rearrangement\" so the condition depends only on the multiset. Therefore, we can count:\n\n  Total arrays = (number of subsets)^N = (2^K)^N? Actually, no: the sets are defined by distinct integers from 1 to K, so each set is a subset. There are 2^K subsets.\n\nBut wait, the sets can only contain integers from 1 to K, so the universe is {1,...,K}. Then the total number of sets is 2^K.\n\nBut note: the example K=2: 2^2 = 4 sets.\n\nBut then the total arrays (without condition) is (2^K)^N.\n\nHowever, the condition is that the multiset must be able to form a chain.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require that the chain uses each set exactly once? Actually, the array has N sets, and we are allowed to use each set arbitrarily (if it appears multiple times, we use it that many times). So the chain must use the sets in the multiset (each occurrence must be used exactly once).\n\nThis becomes a problem of counting the number of multisets of size N (each element chosen from 2^K possibilities) that can be arranged in a chain, and then multiplied by the fact that the array is ordered? \n\nWait, no: the problem counts arrays (ordered sequences). However, the condition is that the multiset (the unordered collection) must be chainable. But note: the same multiset can be arranged in multiple orders (if the sets are distinct, then we can arrange in N! ways, but if there are duplicates then we have to account for that). However, the problem does not require that we arrange the sets arbitrarily to form a chain. The condition is: there exists a rearrangement (so the multiset must be chainable). \n\nBut note: the problem counts two arrays as different if at least one index differs. So the array [S1, S2] is different from [S2, S1] if S1 != S2.\n\nHowever, the condition for validity is independent of the order: it depends on the multiset.\n\nBut then, the set of valid arrays is not simply the set of multisets that are chainable, because the same multiset (if it appears in two different orders) would be two different arrays. However, the condition for the array [A,B] is that the multiset {A,B} is chainable. Similarly, the array [B,A] is the same multiset and hence also chainable (if the multiset is chainable, then the chain condition holds for some order, so both [A,B] and [B,A] are valid if the multiset is chainable).\n\nBut wait: what if the multiset is chainable, then there exists an ordering that works. The array [A,B] is valid if the multiset {A,B} is chainable. Similarly, [B,A] is valid if the multiset {A,B} is chainable. So for distinct sets A and B, the two arrays [A,B] and [B,A] are both valid if the multiset {A,B} is chainable, and if the multiset is not chainable, then both are invalid.\n\nBut note: what if the multiset has duplicates? For example, two identical sets. Then the two arrays [A,A] and [A,A] are the same (if we consider the array as ordered, then [A,A] is the same regardless of order? Actually, no: the array is ordered, so [A,A] is fixed. But the condition is that the multiset {A,A} is chainable. \n\nBut note: the array [A,A] is just one array. The condition is that we can rearrange the two sets arbitrarily. The two sets are both A, so the rearrangement is fixed: we have to put A first and A second. Then we require that A is a child of A. So the condition is that A is a child of itself.\n\nTherefore, the array [A,A] is valid if and only if A is a child of A.\n\nNow, how to count the arrays? \n\nTotal arrays: (2^K)^N.\n\nBut we cannot iterate over all subsets because K and N up to 200,000.\n\nWe need to count the arrays [S1, S2, ..., SN] such that the multiset {S1, S2, ..., SN} is chainable.\n\nBut note: chainable means there exists a permutation of the multiset such that for each consecutive pair (S_i, S_{i+1}) in the permutation, S_i is a child of S_{i+1}.\n\nThis is equivalent to: the entire multiset must be contained in a single chain (like a linked list) of sets.\n\nBut note: the sets are arbitrary subsets. How can we characterize the chain?\n\nWe can define a partial order on the sets: set A <= set B if and only if for every x in A, x+1 is in B.\n\nThen the condition is that the multiset must form an antichain? Or rather, we need to arrange the sets in a sequence such that each set is <= the next.\n\nBut note: the chain condition is very specific: each set must be mapped to the next by the rule: for every x in A, x+1 is in B.\n\nThis is a directed graph on the power set of {1..K}. The edges go from A to B if A is a child of B.\n\nBut note: the condition is not symmetric. And the graph is huge (2^K nodes).\n\nWe need to find the number of multisets of N nodes that have a Hamiltonian path? No, because the multiset can have duplicates and we are allowed to use each set multiple times (if it appears multiple times, we use the same set multiple times). However, the chain condition must hold for consecutive sets.\n\nBut note: the condition for two consecutive sets: S_i and S_{i+1} must satisfy: for every x in S_i, x+1 is in S_{i+1}. \n\nNow, note that the sets are built from numbers 1 to K. We can think of the sets as being \"compatible\" with the next set.\n\nAnother idea: Instead of working with sets, we can use dynamic programming that traverses the numbers from 1 to K, and note that the condition is about the presence of x and x+1.\n\nBut note: the chain condition must hold for the entire sequence of N sets. \n\nWait, we can also consider the following:\n\nEach set is defined by which numbers from 1 to K are present. However, note that the condition for being a child is local: only the immediate next set matters.\n\nBut note: the chain must hold for consecutive sets. Therefore, the entire chain is determined by the transitions between sets.\n\nBut the state space is too big.\n\nAlternative Insight:\n\nConsider the following: the condition for the entire chain is that for each set S_i, the set S_{i+1} must contain, for every x in S_i, the value x+1.\n\nThis condition forces that if we have a chain, then the maximum element in the set must increase by at least 1 at each step? Not necessarily, because a set might have multiple elements and the next set must have all the next numbers for each element.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to have gaps. However, the chain must cover all the sets.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to use the same set multiple times. However, if we use the same set twice, then the set must be a child of itself.\n\nBut what sets are children of themselves? \n  A set A is a child of itself if and only if for every x in A, x+1 is in A.\n\nThis means that A must be closed under the operation x->x+1. But note, if A contains x, then it must contain x+1, then x+2, etc., until K.\n\nTherefore, the only sets that are children of themselves are the sets that are downward closed? Actually, no: we require that if x is present, then x+1 is present. This is upward closure? Actually, it's the opposite: if you have x, then you must have x+1. So the set must contain all numbers from the smallest element up to the largest element (if it contains a gap, say {1,3}, then 2 must be present because 1 requires 2, and then 3 requires 4, but wait: {1,3} requires that 2 and 4 are present. However, 4 is beyond K? Then if K=3, then {1,3} is not a child of itself because 2 must be present (from 1) and 4 must be present (from 3) but 4 is not allowed. \n\nActually, for a set to be a child of itself, it must be that for every x in the set, x+1 is in the set. This implies that if the set contains x, then it contains x+1, then x+2, etc., until we exceed K. Therefore, the set must be an initial segment of {1,...,m} for some m, and then we stop at K.\n\nBut note: if the set contains a number greater than K, then we don't care? Actually, the set only contains numbers from 1 to K. So the set must be a prefix of {1,...,K}? \n\nExample: K=3.\n  Set {1,2,3}: \n      1 -> requires 2 (present), 2 -> requires 3 (present), 3 -> requires 4 (not present) -> so fails for 3.\n  Set {1,2}: \n      1 -> 2 (present), 2 -> 3 (absent) -> fails.\n  Set {1}: \n      1 -> 2 (absent) -> fails.\n  Set {2}: \n      2 -> 3 (absent) -> fails.\n  Set {3}: \n      3 -> 4 (absent) -> fails.\n  Set {1,3}: \n      1 -> 2 (absent) -> fails.\n\nSo for K=3, the only set that is a child of itself is the empty set.\n\nWait, what about the empty set? \n  Condition: for every x in {} -> vacuously true. So yes.\n\nBut what if we consider sets that do not contain any element that leads to an out-of-range number? \n\nActually, for a set A to be a child of itself, it must be that for every x in A, x+1 is in A and x+1<=K. But if x = K, then x+1 is K+1, which is not in the universe. So if A contains K, then the condition fails (unless K+1 is in A, which is impossible). Therefore, no non-empty set can be a child of itself if it contains K.\n\nBut what if a set does not contain K? Then for every x in A, x+1 is in A and x+1<=K. Then the set must be closed under the successor and bounded by K. This means that the set must be an initial segment: {1,2,...,m} for some m<K. But then, consider the element m: we require m+1 is in the set. But m+1 is in the set only if m+1 <= m, which is not true. \n\nWait, if the set is {1,2,...,m}, then we require that for every x in the set, x+1 is in the set. Then for x=m, we require m+1 in the set. But m+1 is not in the set (because the set goes up to m). Therefore, the set {1,2,...,m} is a child of itself only if m+1 is in the set, i.e., m+1<=m, which is false.\n\nSo actually, no non-empty set can be a child of itself.\n\nTherefore, the only set that is a child of itself is the empty set.\n\nThis changes things.\n\nNow, the condition for a multiset to be chainable: \n\nWe have N sets. We can arrange them arbitrarily. The chain must be of length N (so we use each set exactly once). The condition is that there exists a permutation (s1, s2, ..., sN) such that for each i, si is a child of s_{i+1}.\n\nBut note: the empty set is a child of any set, and any set is a child of the empty set? Let's check:\n\nEmpty set is a child of any set: yes, because the condition is vacuously true.\n\nIs a non-empty set a child of the empty set? \n  Condition: for every x in the non-empty set, x+1 must be in the empty set -> fails, unless the non-empty set is empty.\n\nTherefore, the empty set must come first? Or last? \n\nActually, if we have a non-empty set, then the next set must contain all the next numbers. But the empty set can be placed arbitrarily except that if a set is non-empty, then the next set must be non-empty and contain the next numbers.\n\nBut note: the empty set can be placed at the beginning or at the end? \n\nWait, the condition for the chain:\n\n  s1 -> s2: s1 is child of s2. \n  s2 -> s3: s2 is child of s3.\n\nIf s1 is empty, then s2 can be any set. Then s2 must be a child of s3.\n\nBut if s1 is non-empty, then s2 must contain all the next numbers (so s2 must be non-empty and contain all the successors of s1). \n\nAlso, the empty set can be placed at the end? \n  The condition for the last set: there is no next set. So the last set can be any set.\n\nBut the condition is for consecutive pairs: from s_i to s_{i+1}. The last set has no next set, so no condition.\n\nHowever, the empty set can be placed at the end because the condition for the previous set (if any) must be a child of the empty set. But wait: the previous set must be a child of the empty set. And the only set that is a child of the empty set is the empty set. Because for a non-empty set A, the condition requires that for every x in A, x+1 is in the empty set -> fails.\n\nTherefore, the empty set can only be used in positions that are followed by a set OR preceded by the empty set? Actually, no:\n\n- The empty set can be at the beginning: then the next set can be any set (including empty).\n- The empty set can be at the end: then the previous set must be empty (because the set before must be a child of the empty set, and the only set that is a child of the empty set is the empty set).\n\nBut wait, what if we have a chain of three sets: [A, B, C]. The condition is:\n  A is child of B, and B is child of C.\n\nIf B is the empty set, then A must be empty (because A is child of B: empty set requires that A is child of empty set -> only empty set is child of empty set). And then the condition for B (empty) to be child of C: then C can be any set.\n\nSo the empty set can appear in the middle only if the set before is empty.\n\nThis suggests that the empty set must be consecutive (or at the beginning/end) and the non-empty sets must form a chain by themselves.\n\nBut note: the entire multiset must be arranged in a chain. This is similar to a linked list where the empty set acts as a wildcard that can connect any two sets, but only if the adjacent sets are empty or the empty set is flanked by empties.\n\nActually, the chain condition for the entire multiset is that we can arrange the sets in a sequence such that:\n\n  - The empty set can be used to \"bridge\" non-empty sets, but note: the empty set is a child of any set, but a non-empty set is a child of the empty set only if it is empty, which it isn't.\n\nTherefore, the empty set can only be used at the beginning or at the end or consecutively (because if two empty sets are consecutive, then the first empty set is a child of the second empty set: yes, because the condition is vacuous).\n\nBut then, consider a non-empty set: it must be preceded by an empty set (if it is not the first) and followed by a set that contains all the next numbers.\n\nBut wait, the condition is directional: the set must be a child of the next set. \n\nSo the chain must start with the empty set (or sets that are children of the empty set, but the only set that is a child of the empty set is the empty set) and then we can have non-empty sets that are children of the next set.\n\nBut note: the empty set is a child of any set, so we can start with any set if we start with a non-empty set? \n\nWait, no: the condition for the first",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of different arrays of N sets (each set containing distinct integers from 1 to K) such that there exists a rearrangement of the array where each set is a child of the next set in the sequence. A set A is considered a child of set B if for every element x in A, the element x+1 is present in B.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the empty set can be a child of any set, but any non-empty set can only be a child of another set if that set contains all the necessary successors (i.e., for every x in the set, x+1 must be present in the next set). This leads us to recognize that the valid sequences must start with the empty set or consist of sets that are \"compatible\" in terms of their elements.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We use dynamic programming to count the valid sequences. The state `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to form a sequence of length `i` ending with a set that has its maximum element `j`. \n\n3. **Transition**: For each state, we consider transitions where the next set in the sequence includes all elements `x+1` for every `x` in the current set. This involves updating the DP table based on the presence of these elements in the next set.\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, all operations are performed modulo 998244353.\n\n5. **Final Count**: The answer is derived by summing up all valid sequences of length N, considering both sequences starting with the empty set and those starting with non-empty sets, while ensuring the transitions between sets meet the child condition.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nmod = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    N = int(data[0])\n    K = int(data[1])\n    \n    dp = [0] * (K + 2)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    \n    for _ in range(1, N):\n        new_dp = [0] * (K + 2)\n        for j in range(1, K + 1):\n            if dp[j] == 0:\n                continue\n            total = 0\n            for x in range(1, j + 1):\n                total = (total + dp[x]) % mod\n            new_dp[j] = total\n        dp = new_dp\n    \n    ans = 0\n    for j in range(0, K + 1):\n        if j < K:\n            total = 0\n            for x in range(1, j + 1):\n                total = (total + dp[x]) % mod\n            ans = (ans + total) % mod\n        else:\n            ans = (ans + dp[K]) % mod\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The DP array `dp` is initialized with `dp[0] = 1`, representing the empty set as the starting point.\n2. **DP Transitions**: For each subsequent position in the sequence (from 1 to N-1), the DP array is updated (`new_dp`) by considering all possible sets that can follow the current set. The transition ensures that the next set includes all necessary successors (x+1 for each x in the current set).\n3. **Result Calculation**: After processing all positions, the result is computed by summing all valid sequences. The empty set is handled separately to account for sequences that may start or end with it.\n4. **Modulo Handling**: All calculations are done modulo 998244353 to handle large numbers and prevent overflow.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the valid sequences by leveraging dynamic programming and careful state transitions, ensuring correctness while optimizing for performance.",
