Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n and x, then n lines of (li, ri, costi)\n Conditions: \n   - We need two distinct vouchers i and j such that:\n        (ri - li + 1) + (rj - lj + 1) = x   [total duration is x]\n   - The two vouchers do not intersect: meaning either ri < lj or rj < li.\n\n Steps:\n\n Observation: The total duration condition is (duration_i + duration_j = x). So if we let d_i = ri - li + 1, then we require d_i + d_j = x.\n\n Also, the two vouchers must be disjoint. This means that one voucher must end before the other starts.\n\n Approach:\n\n 1. Precompute the duration for each voucher.\n 2. We are going to group the vouchers by their duration. For a given duration d, we'll keep track of the best (lowest) cost for a voucher with that duration, but note: there might be multiple non-overlapping pairs and we have to check the disjoint condition.\n\n However, the disjoint condition is about intervals: even if two vouchers have the same duration, they might overlap. So we cannot simply take the minimal cost for each duration and then combine two durations that sum to x.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n Let's consider: We need two vouchers (i, j) such that d_i + d_j = x, and the intervals [li, ri] and [lj, rj] do not intersect.\n\n We can break the problem into two parts:\n\n   Part 1: Group by duration, but also store the intervals (or at least the start and end) for each voucher.\n\n   Part 2: For each voucher, we want to find a voucher with duration = x - d_i that does not intersect and has minimal cost.\n\n But note: There could be multiple vouchers with the same duration. We want the minimal cost for a voucher with duration d that does not intersect the current one.\n\n However, the disjoint condition: For two vouchers (a and b) with durations da and db (da+db=x), we require that either:\n      a ends before b starts: ra < lb OR rb < la.\n\n Since the two vouchers can be in any order, we can assume without loss of generality that the first voucher ends before the second starts (if we take the one that ends earlier as the first). But note: the two vouchers are independent. We have two cases.\n\n How to efficiently check for non-intersection?\n\n Idea: Instead of iterating over all pairs, we can precompute:\n\n   For each duration d, we want to record the minimal cost and also the earliest start time? Actually, for two vouchers to be disjoint, we require that one ends before the other starts.\n\n We can try to use two separate arrays for the two vouchers. But note: we are grouping by duration. We can also consider the entire set of vouchers and then for each voucher, look for a voucher of duration x-d_i that does not overlap.\n\n However, the constraints are up to 200,000, so we cannot iterate over each voucher and then for each duration x-d_i, iterate over all vouchers of that duration (which might be many).\n\n Another idea:\n\n   Precompute an array for each duration d (from 1 to max_duration) the minimal cost for a voucher with duration d, but also we need to know the interval (start and end) to check for non-intersection.\n\n But note: We cannot just take the minimal cost voucher because even if it has minimal cost, its interval might conflict. However, we might consider: for a fixed duration d, we want to record the minimal cost and also the minimal ending time (to leave as early as possible) and the maximal starting time (to leave as late as possible)? Actually, for non-intersection with another voucher, we have two conditions:\n\n   Condition 1: If we take a voucher with duration d (voucher A) and a voucher with duration d' (voucher B) such that d+d'=x, then we require either:\n        A ends before B starts: A: [l1, r1], B: [l2, r2] -> r1 < l2\n        or B ends before A starts: r2 < l1.\n\n Since the two vouchers are independent, we can consider two cases: one where the first voucher (with duration d) ends before the second (with duration d') starts, and the other where the second ends before the first starts.\n\n Therefore, we can split the problem into two cases:\n\n   Case 1: Voucher i (duration d) comes first, then voucher j (duration d') comes later, and they don't overlap if r_i < l_j.\n   Case 2: Voucher j (duration d') comes first, then voucher i (duration d) comes later, and they don't overlap if r_j < l_i.\n\n But note: In the problem, the two vouchers are chosen arbitrarily, so we can assign which one is first arbitrarily.\n\n However, we can reframe: We want to choose two vouchers (A, B) such that either:\n      A ends before B starts, OR B ends before A starts, and d_A + d_B = x.\n\n So we can consider two sets:\n\n   Set1: All vouchers with duration d (for each d) and we want to combine with Set2: All vouchers with duration x-d.\n\n Then, for each voucher in Set1 (with duration d) and each voucher in Set2 (with duration x-d), we check if they are disjoint.\n\n But that would be O(n^2) in worst-case.\n\n We need a more efficient method.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n   Step 1: Precompute for each duration d (from 1 to max_d) the list of vouchers (each voucher represented by (l, r, cost)).\n\n   Step 2: We'll create two dictionaries (or arrays) for each duration d:\n        dict_min[d] = minimal cost for a voucher of duration d, but we also need to know the entire set of intervals for that duration? \n\n   However, the disjoint condition requires checking the intervals.\n\n   Step 3: We can precompute for each duration d, the minimal cost and the minimal ending time (so that we can quickly check if there's a voucher that ends early enough to avoid overlapping with a given start) and similarly the maximal starting time (to see if there's a voucher that starts late enough to avoid overlapping with a given end). But note: we are combining two different durations (d and x-d). And we have two orders.\n\n   Let me break down:\n\n   For a fixed duration d, we want to consider two types of vouchers:\n\n        Type1: Those that can be used as the first part (ending early) for pairing with a voucher of duration x-d (the second part).\n        Type2: Those that can be used as the second part (starting late) for pairing with a voucher of duration x-d (the first part).\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n        For each duration d, we want to store two things:\n\n            Option1: The minimal cost for a voucher of duration d that ends as early as possible (so that it can be followed by a voucher of duration x-d that starts after this one's end).\n            Option2: The minimal cost for a voucher of duration d that starts as late as possible (so that it can be preceded by a voucher of duration x-d that ends before this one's start).\n\n   But wait, we have two different ways to pair: \n\n        Case1: Use a voucher of duration d (call it A) and a voucher of duration x-d (call it B) such that A ends before B starts.\n\n        Case2: Use a voucher of duration x-d (call it B) and a voucher of duration d (call it A) such that B ends before A starts.\n\n   Actually, these two cases are symmetric. So we can handle both by considering:\n\n        For each duration d, let d2 = x - d.\n\n        Then, for Case1: We want a voucher A (duration d) and a voucher B (duration d2) such that A's end < B's start.\n\n        For Case2: We want a voucher B (duration d2) and a voucher A (duration d) such that B's end < A's start.\n\n   Now, how to quickly find the minimal cost pair in each case?\n\n   We can precompute:\n\n        For each duration d, we store:\n            list_d[d] = list of (l, r, cost) for all vouchers of duration d.\n\n        Then, we can also precompute:\n\n            For each duration d, we want to create two arrays:\n\n                For Case1 (A ends early): We want to minimize the cost of A (with duration d) and also ensure that A ends (r) is less than the start (l) of some B (with duration d2). But note: we are going to look for the minimal total cost (cost_A + cost_B). \n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute for each duration d:\n\n            min_cost_early_end[d] = minimal cost among all vouchers of duration d that have the minimal ending time? Not exactly.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            For each duration d, we want to quickly answer: given a query of the form \"find a voucher of duration d that ends <= T\" (for T being the start of B minus one, or something) and then take the minimal cost among those.\n\n        But note: we are combining two sets. We need to consider:\n\n            Case1: For a voucher B (duration d2) with start s, we require that there exists a voucher A (duration d) with end < s. Then we want the minimal cost for A (duration d) that has end < s.\n\n        Similarly, Case2: For a voucher A (duration d) with start s, we require that there exists a voucher B (duration d2) with end < s. Then we want the minimal cost for B (duration d2) that has end < s.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Read input and compute d_i = r_i - l_i + 1 for each voucher.\n\n        Step 2: Group the vouchers by duration. Also, we are only interested in durations from 1 to x (since d_i >=1, and x>=2, and d_i+d_j=x, so d_i and d_j must be at least 1 and at most x-1).\n\n        Step 3: Precompute for each duration d (that appears) two data structures:\n\n            For Case1 (using A (duration d) and B (duration d2=x-d)):\n                We need to quickly, for a given start time s (of voucher B), find the minimal cost of a voucher A (duration d) with end < s.\n\n            Similarly, for Case2 (using B (duration d2) and A (duration d)):\n                We need to quickly, for a given start time s (of voucher A), find the minimal cost of a voucher B (duration d2) with end < s.\n\n        However, note: in Case1, the voucher A must have duration d, and we are looking for A with end < s (where s is the start of B). Similarly, in Case2, the voucher B must have duration d2, and we are looking for B with end < s (where s is the start of A).\n\n        But note: the two cases are symmetric. Actually, we can combine:\n\n            We are going to consider two scenarios:\n\n            Scenario 1: A (duration d) and B (duration d2) with A ending before B starts.\n                Total cost = cost_A + cost_B.\n                Conditions: r_A < l_B.\n\n            Scenario 2: B (duration d2) and A (duration d) with B ending before A starts.\n                Conditions: r_B < l_A.\n\n        We can process both by:\n\n            For each duration d (and corresponding d2 = x-d):\n\n                We have two sets: set_d (vouchers of duration d) and set_d2 (vouchers of duration d2).\n\n                For Scenario 1: We want to consider each voucher B in set_d2 (with start l_B) and then find the minimal cost voucher A in set_d that has end < l_B.\n\n                Similarly, for Scenario 2: We want to consider each voucher A in set_d (with start l_A) and then find the minimal cost voucher B in set_d2 that has end < l_A.\n\n        But doing that naively (iterating over each voucher and then scanning the other set) would be too slow.\n\n        We need to preprocess set_d and set_d2 for fast queries.\n\n        Idea for preprocessing:\n\n            For a fixed duration d, we want to be able to answer: \n                Query: Given a time t, what is the minimal cost of a voucher in set_d that has end < t?\n\n            Similarly, for set_d2.\n\n        Then, for Scenario 1:\n\n            For each voucher B in set_d2 (with start l_B and cost c_B), we query set_d for minimal cost of a voucher A (duration d) with end < l_B. Then candidate total cost = (min_cost_A) + c_B.\n\n            Similarly, for Scenario 2:\n\n            For each voucher A in set_d (with start l_A and cost c_A), we query set_d2 for minimal cost of a voucher B (duration d2) with end < l_A. Then candidate total cost = c_A + (min_cost_B).\n\n        Then we take the minimum candidate from both scenarios.\n\n        However, note: the same pair might be considered twice? But no, because in Scenario 1 we consider A and B in a fixed order (A then B) and in Scenario 2 we consider the reverse order (B then A). But note: the condition for Scenario 1 is A ends before B starts, and Scenario 2 is B ends before A starts. They are mutually exclusive. So we can consider both and take the minimum.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Precomputation:\n\n                Let max_day = 200000 (as per constraints)\n\n                Create a dictionary: groups = {}\n                For each voucher (l, r, cost):\n                    d = r - l + 1\n                    if d not in groups: groups[d] = []\n                    groups[d].append( (l, r, cost) )\n\n                Also, we are only interested in durations d such that d <= x-1 (because d2 = x-d must be at least 1, so d <= x-1) and d>=1.\n\n            Then, for each duration d (in the keys of groups) such that d <= x-1 and x-d is also in groups (or if x-d is not present, skip) we do:\n\n                d2 = x - d\n\n                Preprocess set_d (vouchers of duration d) for queries: We want to quickly get the minimal cost for a voucher that ends before a given time t.\n\n                Similarly for set_d2.\n\n                How to preprocess set_d for queries by end time?\n\n                    We can sort the vouchers in set_d by their end time (r). Then, we can create an array of (r, cost) and then for each distinct r, we want to know the minimal cost for vouchers with end <= t.\n\n                    Actually, we can do:\n\n                        Let arr_d = sorted( [(r, cost) for (l, r, cost) in groups[d]] , key=lambda x: x[0] )\n                        Then, we can create a prefix minimum array for arr_d: \n                            prefix_min[i] = min(cost for the first i+1 elements) but we want to consider all elements up to index i (by end time).\n\n                    But note: we are going to query by t (the start of the other voucher). We want the minimal cost for any voucher with end < t.\n\n                    We can use binary search to find the last voucher with end < t, then take the minimal cost from the prefix.\n\n                However, note: we might have multiple vouchers with the same end? Then we want the minimal cost among all vouchers with end < t.\n\n                Steps for set_d:\n\n                    Sort by r (end day) and then create an array of (r, min_cost_so_far) where min_cost_so_far is the minimal cost encountered up to that r.\n\n                    Then, for a query t, we find the largest r0 < t, then the minimal cost for any voucher with end <= r0 is stored at the position corresponding to r0.\n\n                But note: we don't care about the exact r0, just the minimal cost for any voucher with end < t.\n\n            Then, for Scenario1:\n\n                For each voucher B in set_d2 (duration d2) with (l_B, r_B, cost_B) [we don't need r_B for the query, but we use l_B as threshold t = l_B]:\n                    Query set_d: minimal cost of voucher A (duration d) with end < l_B -> call this min_cost_A.\n                    Then candidate = min_cost_A + cost_B.\n\n                Similarly, for Scenario2:\n\n                For each voucher A in set_d (duration d) with (l_A, r_A, cost_A):\n                    Query set_d2: minimal cost of voucher B (duration d2) with end < l_A -> call this min_cost_B.\n                    Then candidate = cost_A + min_cost_B.\n\n            Then we take the minimum candidate from both scenarios for this (d, d2) pair.\n\n            But note: we must consider that a voucher might appear in both sets? No, because d and d2 are fixed and the voucher has a fixed duration.\n\n        However, we must consider: the same voucher might be used twice? The problem says two distinct vouchers. But note: our grouping by duration d and d2 might be the same if d == d2, and then we are using two different vouchers (but same duration). That's allowed as long as they are distinct.\n\n        But wait: if d == d2, then we are considering the same set of vouchers (groups[d]) for both set_d and set_d2. Then we must ensure that we are not taking the same voucher twice.\n\n        However, the query for set_d in Scenario1: We are querying for a voucher A (from groups[d]) that ends < l_B (the start of B). Since B is from groups[d] (same set) and we are iterating over B, then when we query for A we are excluding B? Not necessarily: we don't know if the minimal cost voucher A is the same as B.\n\n        But note: we are iterating over B (vouchers of duration d) and then querying the entire set_d (including B?) for a voucher A with end < l_B. However, the voucher B has duration d and we are using the entire set_d. But the condition for Scenario1 is that A and B must be distinct. \n\n        However, we are not enforcing distinctness in the query. We are just taking the minimal cost from the entire set_d that satisfies the condition. But if the minimal cost voucher A happens to be the same as B, then we are using the same voucher twice. That is invalid.\n\n        How to avoid that?\n\n        We need to consider: if d == d2, then we are using two vouchers from the same set. We must ensure that the voucher A we pick is not the same as B.\n\n        One way: we can store the entire set_d and set_d2, and then for Scenario1, we want to exclude B from set_d? But then we have to know which voucher is B. Alternatively, we can design the query to return the minimal cost from set_d excluding the specific voucher B.\n\n        However, note: the condition for Scenario1 is that A must end < l_B. But if we are excluding B, then we must know which voucher is B. But we are iterating over B, so we could do:\n\n            For each B in set_d2 (which is the same as set_d if d==d2) we want to query set_d for a voucher A (distinct from B) with end < l_B.\n\n        But then we cannot simply precompute a global structure for set_d. We need to know the specific voucher B to exclude.\n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute two structures for set_d:\n\n            Structure1: Entire set_d (without exclusion) and then if d==d2, we also have to account for the fact that the minimal cost voucher might be B. \n\n        This complicates the matter.\n\n        Let me restructure: Instead, we can avoid using the same voucher by ensuring that the query for A (in Scenario1) returns a voucher that is not B. But note: the condition for Scenario1 is based on the end time of A and the start time of B. The same voucher B has an end time and a start time, and we are using B's start time to query A's end time.\n\n        However, the minimal cost voucher A might be B itself? Only if B's end < l_B (which is always true? Because B's start is l_B, and B's end is r_B, and by definition r_B >= l_B. So condition for B being A: we require r_B < l_B -> false. So if d == d2, then the same voucher B cannot be used as A (because for B to be used as A, we require r_B < l_B, which is never true). \n\n        Therefore, even if d == d2, the minimal cost voucher A that we find (from set_d) for a given B will never be B because the condition for A is that its end < l_B, and B's end is r_B which is >= l_B (since the voucher is [l_B, r_B] and r_B>=l_B). \n\n        Similarly, for Scenario2: the condition for B is that its end < l_A. And for a voucher A, if we consider it as B, then we require r_A < l_A, which is false. So again, we never pick the same voucher.\n\n        Therefore, we don't have to worry about excluding the same voucher.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Let ans = a very large number (like 10**18)\n\n            For each duration d that is in the groups and d <= x-1, and d2 = x-d is also in the groups:\n\n                Let set_d = groups[d]   (list of (l, r, cost))\n                Let set_d2 = groups[d2] (list of (l, r, cost))\n\n                Preprocess set_d for queries by end time (r) to answer: minimal cost for any voucher with end < t.\n\n                Preprocess set_d2 for queries by end time (r) to answer: minimal cost for any voucher with end < t.\n\n                Then:\n\n                    Scenario1: For each voucher in set_d2 (which we call B) with (l_B, r_B, cost_B):\n                            Query set_d: minimal cost for voucher A (duration d) with end < l_B.\n                            If found, candidate = query_result + cost_B, update ans.\n\n                    Scenario2: For each voucher in set_d (which we call A) with (l_A, r_A, cost_A):\n                            Query set_d2: minimal cost for voucher B (duration d2) with end < l_A.\n                            If found, candidate = cost_A + query_result, update ans.\n\n            Then, if ans remains the very large number, output -1, else output ans.\n\n        But note: we might have multiple pairs (d, d2) and (d2, d) but since d and d2 are symmetric (and we are iterating d from 1 to x-1, and if d != d2 then we will also consider d2 separately? Actually, we are iterating each d such that d<=x-1 and d2 exists. So we cover both (d, d2) and (d2, d) if d != d2? \n\n        Actually, no: if d != d2, then when we consider d, we look at d2. Then when we consider d2, we look at x-d2 = d. So we are covering both directions.\n\n        But wait, we are iterating d from the keys of groups. We must avoid double counting? Actually, no: we are updating the answer from both directions independently. And the minimal cost might be found in one direction or the other.\n\n        However, we are processing each (d, d2) only once (when d is present and d2 is present). And if d != d2, then we will process (d, d2) and (d2, d) separately (if both d and d2 are in the groups). But note: we are iterating over the keys of groups. We must ensure that we don't skip d2 if d2 is not the same as d.\n\n        Actually, we are iterating d over the keys of groups. Then for each d, we check if x-d is in groups. Then we process the pair (d, x-d). Then, when we later encounter d2 = x-d, we will process (d2, x-d2) = (d2, d). So we process each unordered pair twice (if d != d2). \n\n        But that's okay, because the two scenarios (A then B and B then A) are two different orders and might yield different costs (if the minimal cost in one scenario is cheaper than the other). However, the two scenarios are symmetric? Actually, no: the two vouchers are distinct and the conditions are symmetric, but the minimal cost might come from different vouchers.\n\n        But note: the total cost is additive and the two scenarios are independent. We want the minimal total cost overall. So we are covering all possibilities.\n\n        However, we must be cautious of performance: \n\n            We are iterating over each d (at most 200000 distinct d? Actually, the duration d can be from 1 to 200000, but n is 200000, so the distinct d might be up to 200000).\n\n            Then for each d, we are iterating over set_d and set_d2 (which might be large). The total number of vouchers is n=200000, so if we do two passes (one for set_d and one for set_d2) for each d, the total work would be O(n^2) in the worst-case if we iterate over every voucher in set_d and set_d2 for each d.\n\n        We need to optimize.\n\n        Instead, we can precompute for each duration d the sorted list and the prefix minimum for the entire set_d (by end time) and then for each voucher in set_d2, we do a binary search and then a constant-time lookup.\n\n        Then, for Scenario1, we are doing |set_d2| * (binary search in set_d) operations. Similarly for Scenario2.\n\n        The total work over all d would be:\n\n            For each d (that is present and d<=x-1 and d2 present) we do:\n\n                |set_d2| * log(|set_d|) + |set_d| * log(|set_d2|)\n\n            Then, we sum over all d.\n\n        But note: the same voucher might be counted in multiple d? Actually, each voucher has one duration. And we are grouping by duration.\n\n        The total number of vouchers is n, so the sum of |set_d| for all d is n. However, we are iterating over d (each distinct duration) and for each d we iterate over set_d and set_d2. \n\n        But note: each voucher is in exactly one set_d (by its own duration). However, we are processing a pair (d, d2) and then the same set_d might be used multiple times (for different d2). \n\n        Actually, we are iterating d from the keys of groups. The total number of distinct d is at most 200000, but the condition d<=x-1 and x-d in groups might reduce the number of pairs.\n\n        However, worst-case: if we have many distinct durations, and we do for each distinct d (say m distinct durations) and for each we do |set_d2| and |set_d|, then the total work is:\n\n            Sum_{d} [ |set_d| + |set_d2| ] = Sum_{d} [ |set_d| + |set_{x-d}| ]\n\n        And note that each voucher is included in two terms: once for d and once for x-d (if d != x-d) or once if d = x-d. \n\n        But wait: we are iterating d and then looking at d2 = x-d. Each voucher with duration d is included in the set_d for the pair (d, x-d) and also in the set_d2 for the pair (x-d, d). \n\n        Actually, we are processing each pair (d, d2) twice (if d != d2) and each voucher is in two sets (set_d and set_d2 for two different pairs). \n\n        The total work is O(n) per pair? Actually, no: the work for a fixed d is |set_d| (for Scenario2) and |set_d2| (for Scenario1). And we are doing that for each d that satisfies the condition.\n\n        Since each voucher is included in the size of set_d for each d that is its duration, and we are iterating over each d (each distinct duration) that is present, the total work is:\n\n            For each distinct d (that is present and d<=x-1 and x-d present) we do:\n\n                Work_d = |set_d| + |set_d2|\n\n            Then, the sum over d is:\n\n                Sum_{d: d in groups and d<=x-1 and x-d in groups} [ |set_d| + |set_d2| ]\n\n            And note that each voucher is counted in two terms: once in set_d (for the duration d) and once in set_d2 (for the duration d2) for the pair (d, d2). But wait: if d != d2, then the voucher is in set_d for the pair (d, d2) and in set_d2 for the pair (d2, d). So actually, each voucher is counted twice (once for each of the two pairs that involve its duration and the complementary duration).\n\n            Therefore, the total work is O(2*n) = O(n). But note: we are doing two binary searches per voucher? Actually, no: we are building the prefix minimum for set_d and set_d2, and then for each voucher in set_d2 we do one binary search (to find the maximal element in set_d with end < l_B) and then a constant time lookup. Similarly for set_d.\n\n        However, building the prefix minimum for set_d is O(|set_d|) for each d. Then the total building time is O(n) (because the sum of |set_d| is n). Similarly, the total query time is O(|set_d2| * log(|set_d|)) for Scenario1 and O(|set_d| * log(|set_d2|)) for Scenario2. Then, the total query time is O(n * log(n)) because the sum of |set_d2| over d is n (each voucher is in one set_d, and then we are iterating over each set_d2 for each d, but each voucher is in one set_d and then used in one set_d2 for the pair (d2, d) if d2 is present, and we are processing each distinct d).\n\n        Actually, the total query time is:\n\n            For each d: \n                Scenario1: |set_d2| * log(|set_d|)\n                Scenario2: |set_d| * log(|set_d2|)\n\n            Then, the total is:\n\n                Sum_{d} [ |set_d2| * log(|set_d|) + |set_d| * log(|set_d2|) ]\n\n            Since the sum of |set_d| for all d is n, and similarly for set_d2, and the logarithm base is the size of the set we are querying, we can bound:\n\n                <= n * log(max_set_size)\n\n            Because the maximum size of a set_d might be large (up to 200000) and the total number of queries is n (because each voucher is queried once in Scenario1 and once in Scenario2? Actually, no: in Scenario1, we are iterating over set_d2 (each voucher in set_d2 is queried once) and in Scenario2, we are iterating over set_d (each voucher in set_d is queried once). So the total number of queries is n (for Scenario1) + n (for Scenario2) = 2*n.\n\n            And each query is O(log(size)), so the total time is O(2*n*log(n)) which is acceptable for n=200000.\n\n        Implementation details:\n\n            We need to build for each duration d:\n\n                sorted_by_end = sorted( (r, cost) for (l, r, cost) in groups[d] )   # by r\n\n                Then, we build a prefix_min array for sorted_by_end:\n\n                    Let arr = sorted_by_end\n                    prefix_min[i] = minimum cost from arr[0] to arr[i]\n\n                Then, to query for a given t (time), we want the minimal cost for a voucher with end < t.\n\n                Steps for query:\n\n                    Use bisect_left to find the index of the first element with r >= t. Then the last element with r < t is at index = pos-1.\n\n                    If pos == 0, then no voucher has end < t.\n\n                    Otherwise, the minimal cost is prefix_min[pos-1].\n\n            Similarly for set_d2.\n\n        Example with sample: \n            Input: \"4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4\"\n\n            Vouchers:\n                (1,3,4): duration=3\n                (1,2,5): duration=2\n                (5,6,1): duration=2\n                (1,2,4): duration=2\n\n            x=5, so d+d'=5.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two distinct travel vouchers such that the sum of their durations equals exactly `x` (the total vacation days), and the vouchers do not overlap in time. The goal is to minimize the total cost of these two vouchers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. Each voucher is characterized by its start day, end day, and cost. The duration of a voucher is calculated as `(end_day - start_day + 1)`.\n\n2. **Check Valid Pairs**: For each duration `d` present in the grouped vouchers, we check if there exists another duration `d2 = x - d` also present in the groups. If such a pair exists, we proceed to find valid non-overlapping vouchers from both durations.\n\n3. **Efficient Query Handling**: For each valid pair of durations `(d, d2)`, we preprocess the vouchers of duration `d` and `d2` to quickly answer queries about the minimal cost voucher that ends before a given start day. This involves sorting the vouchers by their end day and building a prefix minimum array to facilitate efficient range minimum queries.\n\n4. **Scenario Analysis**: We consider two scenarios for each pair of durations:\n   - **Scenario 1**: A voucher from duration `d` ends before a voucher from duration `d2` starts.\n   - **Scenario 2**: A voucher from duration `d2` ends before a voucher from duration `d` starts.\n   \n   For each scenario, we query the preprocessed data structures to find the minimal cost combination of vouchers that meet the non-overlapping condition.\n\n5. **Result Compilation**: After evaluating all valid pairs and scenarios, we determine the minimal total cost. If no valid pair is found, we return `-1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom bisect import bisect_left\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n        \n    it = iter(data)\n    n = int(next(it)); x = int(next(it))\n    vouchers = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        l = int(next(it)); r = int(next(it)); cost = int(next(it))\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost))\n        \n    groups = {}\n    for (l, r, cost) in vouchers:\n        d = r - l + 1\n        if d not in groups:\n            groups[d] = []\n        groups[d].append((l, r, cost))\n        \n    ans = float('inf')\n    \n    for d in list(groups.keys()):\n        if d > x or (x - d) not in groups:\n            continue\n            \n        d2 = x - d\n        set_d = groups[d]\n        set_d2 = groups[d2]\n        \n        arr_d = []\n        for (l, r, cost_val) in set_d:\n            arr_d.append((r, cost_val))\n        arr_d.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n        m = len(arr_d)\n        prefix_min_d = [0] * m\n        if m > 0:\n            prefix_min_d[0] = arr_d[0][1]\n            for i in range(1, m):\n                prefix_min_d[i] = min(prefix_min_d[i-1], arr_d[i][1])\n                \n        def query_d(t):\n            pos = bisect_left(arr_d, (t, 0))\n            if pos == 0:\n                return float('inf')\n            return prefix_min_d[pos-1]\n            \n        arr_d2 = []\n        for (l, r, cost_val) in set_d2:\n            arr_d2.append((r, cost_val))\n        arr_d2.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n        p = len(arr_d2)\n        prefix_min_d2 = [0] * p\n        if p > 0:\n            prefix_min_d2[0] = arr_d2[0][1]\n            for i in range(1, p):\n                prefix_min_d2[i] = min(prefix_min_d2[i-1], arr_d2[i][1])\n                \n        def query_d2(t):\n            pos = bisect_left(arr_d2, (t, 0))\n            if pos == 0:\n                return float('inf')\n            return prefix_min_d2[pos-1]\n            \n        for (l_B, r_B, cost_B) in set_d2:\n            min_cost_A = query_d(l_B)\n            if min_cost_A != float('inf'):\n                total_cost = min_cost_A + cost_B\n                if total_cost < ans:\n                    ans = total_cost\n                    \n        for (l_A, r_A, cost_A) in set_d:\n            min_cost_B = query_d2(l_A)\n            if min_cost_B != float('inf'):\n                total_cost = cost_A + min_cost_B\n                if total_cost < ans:\n                    ans = total_cost\n                    \n    if ans == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed into individual vouchers, each represented by their start day, end day, and cost.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped into a dictionary where keys are durations and values are lists of vouchers with that duration.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each valid duration pair `(d, d2)`, we sort the vouchers by their end day and build a prefix minimum array to quickly find the minimal cost voucher ending before a specified day.\n4. **Query Processing**: For each voucher in the complementary duration, we query the preprocessed data to find the minimal cost voucher from the original duration that does not overlap. The results from both scenarios (original voucher first or complementary voucher first) are combined to find the overall minimal cost.\n5. **Result Output**: The minimal total cost is printed if valid vouchers are found; otherwise, `-1` is printed indicating no solution exists. \n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem using grouping and preprocessing, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
