The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the task locations)\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (from 1 to n, then back to 1), we can consider the movement in two directions.\n\n However, note: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in increasing order of index (i.e., she must do task1, then task2, ... up to taskm).\n\n The key observation:\n Since the ring is circular and we are only allowed to move clockwise, the movement from one task location to the next can be calculated by considering the ring.\n\n But note: the problem does not require to return to start. We just need to do all tasks in order.\n\n Steps:\n\n Let's denote:\n   current = 1   (starting house)\n\n For each task i (from first to last) at house a_i:\n   We need to go from current to a_i.\n\n How to compute the time from current to a_i in a clockwise ring?\n\n There are two ways to go from current to a_i in a clockwise ring? Actually, since the ring is one-way, we have to go clockwise.\n\n But wait: the ring has two arcs between two points? Actually, because the ring is one-way, we can only move clockwise. Therefore, the distance from current to a_i is:\n   Option 1: if a_i >= current, then we can go directly: (a_i - current) mod n? Actually, no, because we are in a circle and we cannot jump over the entire circle arbitrarily.\n\n However, note: the problem says moving from a house to a neighboring one takes 1 unit. And we can traverse the entire circle.\n\n But the ringroad is one-way. So from house x, you can only go to house x+1 (unless x is n, then next is 1). \n\n Therefore, the distance from current to a_i is:\n\n   If we are at current and want to go to a_i, we can compute:\n\n   Let d1 = (a_i - current) % n   [but this modulus might give negative? Actually, we can do:]\n\n   Actually, because we are moving clockwise, we can also consider going the long way? But wait, the problem states that the ringroad is one-way and we must move clockwise. However, note: the problem does not say that we can't go around the entire circle. But the minimal time would be the minimal steps in the clockwise direction.\n\n   However, in a one-way ring, the only way is clockwise. But there are two ways to get from A to B in a circular ring? Actually, no: we can only go clockwise, so if we are at current, we can either go:\n\n     Option 1: without wrapping: if a_i >= current, then steps = a_i - current.\n     Option 2: with wrapping: if a_i < current, then we go from current to n, then from n to 1, and then to a_i. But wait, we don't necessarily have to wrap the whole circle? Actually, we can also think:\n\n        If we are at current and a_i < current, then we can go:\n            from current to the end (n) and then from 1 to a_i. That would be: (n - current + 1) + (a_i - 1) = n - current + a_i.\n\n        Alternatively, we can also go: \n            from current to n, then from n to 1, and then to a_i, but note that from n to 1 is adjacent (since it's a ring). So the above formula is correct.\n\n        But wait, the direct clockwise path from current to a_i when a_i < current is: \n            total steps = (n - current + a_i)\n\n        However, note: the example: \n          n=4, current=3, a_i=2: \n          Then using the formula: (4-3+2) = 3. But actually, from 3 to 2 in a clockwise ring of 4: \n            3->4 (1 step), then 4->1 (another step), then 1->2 (another step) -> total 3 steps.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write: \n          distance = (a_i - current) % n   but if negative, we adjust.\n\n        Another way: \n          distance = (a_i - current) if a_i >= current else (n - current + a_i)\n\n        But note: we can also use modulo arithmetic to compute the distance in a circle for one-way:\n\n          Since we are going clockwise, we can define:\n          distance = (a_i - current) % n   -> but if (a_i - current) is negative, then we do:\n\n          Actually, we can compute: \n            distance = (a_i - current) % n   # This gives a non-negative number, but wait: \n            Example: current=3, a_i=2, n=4 -> (2-3) %4 = (-1)%4 = 3 (in Python, negative modulo gives a positive result). But is 3 the correct distance? Yes.\n\n          However, wait: if we do (a_i - current) % n, then for a_i>=current: \n            Example: current=1, a_i=3, n=4 -> (3-1)%4 = 2, which is correct.\n\n          But note: the modulus operation in Python for negative: \n            (x - y) % n = (x - y + n) % n if x-y is negative? Actually, the modulus operation in Python returns a result in [0, n-1]. \n\n          However, note: the actual distance should be the smallest nonnegative number such that (distance + current) mod n = a_i, but wait: our movement is linear and we are going clockwise.\n\n          But note: the problem is that we are constrained by the one-way ring. The distance from current to a_i is (a_i - current) if a_i>=current, and (a_i - current + n) if a_i < current.\n\n          Alternatively, we can write: \n            distance = (a_i - current) % n\n            But wait, if a_i < current, then (a_i - current) is negative, and adding n until positive: (a_i - current + n) % n? Actually, the modulus operation does that.\n\n          However, let me test:\n            Example 1: current=3, a_i=2, n=4 -> (2-3) %4 = (-1)%4 = 3 (which is correct).\n            Example 2: current=1, a_i=3, n=4 -> (3-1)%4 = 2 (correct).\n\n          But wait, what if we are at current=4, and a_i=1, n=4?\n            (1-4) %4 = (-3)%4 = 1. But the actual steps: from 4 to 1 is 1 step (since 4->1 is one step in the clockwise direction). Correct.\n\n          However, wait: the movement from 4 to 1 is indeed 1 step (because the ring is 4 houses: 1->2->3->4->1). So yes.\n\n          But note: the modulus operation gives the minimal nonnegative steps to get from current to a_i by moving clockwise? Actually, no: in a one-way ring, the distance is defined as the smallest nonnegative number d such that (current + d) mod n = a_i, but we must account for the fact that the ring is circular and we don't wrap the destination.\n\n          However, note: the problem does not require modular arithmetic for the destination. The houses are numbered 1 to n. The movement is:\n\n            We can express the position after d steps from current (without wrapping) as: \n                pos = current + d\n            But if we exceed n, then we wrap: \n                pos = (current + d - 1) % n + 1\n\n          Alternatively, we can define the distance as:\n\n            d = (a_i - current) % n\n            if d < 0: d += n   -> but in Python, % already makes it positive.\n\n          However, note: the modulus operation for negative numbers: \n            In Python, the modulus is defined so that: \n                (a // b) * b + (a % b) == a\n\n            And the sign of the modulus is the same as the divisor? Actually, no: the modulus has the same sign as the divisor? Actually, no: the modulus is always non-negative when the divisor is positive.\n\n          So we can use: \n            distance = (a_i - current) % n\n            But wait, let me check with the example: \n                current=3, a_i=2, n=4: (2-3) %4 = (-1)%4 = 3 (correct)\n\n          However, note: the modulus operation in mathematics for negative numbers is defined as the remainder after subtracting enough multiples of n so that the result is in [0, n-1]. So 3 is correct.\n\n          BUT: wait, is that the same as the actual steps? The steps we calculated manually was 3, and the modulus gives 3. \n\n          However, note: the modulus operation gives a result in [0, n-1]. What if the distance is 0? \n            Example: current=2, a_i=2, n=4: (2-2)%4=0 -> correct.\n\n          But wait: the problem says that Xenia starts at house 1, and then moves to the next houses. The movement is one step per adjacent house.\n\n          So the total time is the sum of the distances from the current house to each task (with the current house updated to the task house after each task).\n\n          However, note: the problem says \"she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i\". So after completing a task, she is at that house for the next task.\n\n          Therefore, we can simulate:\n\n            total_time = 0\n            current = 1\n            for each task_location in tasks:\n                # Calculate the distance from current to task_location\n                dist = (task_location - current) % n\n                # But wait: if the modulus gives a negative, we adjust by adding n? Actually, the modulus already gives a nonnegative value, but note: the modulus operation in Python for (x-y) % n is equivalent to (x-y+n) % n? Not exactly, but it gives a nonnegative value.\n\n                However, let me test: \n                  (2-3) %4 -> 3, which is the same as (2-3+4) %4 = 3%4=3.\n\n                So we can use: \n                  dist = (task_location - current) % n\n                But wait: what if (task_location - current) is positive? Then modulus is just the positive value if less than n.\n\n                However, note: the modulus operation is defined for any integer. But in our case, the maximum difference is from 1 to n: \n                  task_location can be from 1 to n, current from 1 to n.\n\n                Example: current=1, task_location=4, n=4: (4-1)%4 = 3%4=3 -> which is correct: 1->2->3->4 (3 steps).\n\n                Example: current=4, task_location=1, n=4: (1-4)%4 = (-3)%4 = 1 -> correct.\n\n                However, wait: the modulus operation gives 1 for (-3)%4, but the actual steps from 4 to 1 is 1 (because 4->1 is one step). So that matches.\n\n                But wait, is that always the case? The modulus operation gives the smallest nonnegative integer d such that (current + d) mod n = task_location? \n\n                Actually, in our ring, the positions are labeled 1 to n. We can map them to 0-indexed: \n                  Let current0 = current-1, task0 = task_location-1, then the distance in 0-indexed is (task0 - current0) mod n, then convert back? \n\n                Alternatively, we can think: \n                  The ring has n houses. The clockwise distance from current to task_location is (task_location - current) mod n, but if negative we add n until positive.\n\n                However, note: the modulus operation in Python for (a-b) % n is defined as (a-b) mod n, which is the smallest nonnegative residue.\n\n                But is that the same as the clockwise steps? \n\n                Consider: \n                  We are at current, and we want to reach task_location by moving clockwise. The steps required is the number of steps to reach task_location from current, which is:\n\n                    If we are at current and task_location is ahead (greater or equal): then steps = task_location - current.\n\n                    If task_location is behind (less than current): then steps = n - current + task_location.\n\n                Now, note: \n                  (task_location - current) % n = (task_location - current + n) % n   if task_location < current, then (task_location - current) is negative, so adding n once makes it positive, and then modulus n again? Actually, the modulus operation does that.\n\n                However, let me compare:\n\n                  Case 1: task_location >= current\n                    Then (task_location - current) % n = task_location - current   (because task_location - current is between 0 and n-1)\n\n                  Case 2: task_location < current\n                    Then (task_location - current) % n = (task_location - current + n) % n\n                    But note: task_location - current + n is in the range [1, n-1] (if task_location>=1 and current<=n) so no need to take modulus again? Actually, the modulus operation in Python will do:\n\n                    Example: n=4, task_location=2, current=3: (2-3+4)=3, and 3 %4=3.\n\n                    But wait, is that the same as n - current + task_location? \n                      n - current + task_location = 4-3+2 = 3. Yes.\n\n                So the modulus operation is giving the same as the two-case formula.\n\n                Therefore, we can compute the distance as: \n                  dist = (task_location - current) % n\n                  if dist == 0: then 0, but wait: if task_location==current, then 0, which is correct.\n\n                However, note: the modulus operation might give 0 when task_location==current, but also when (task_location - current) is a multiple of n? But since the difference is at most n-1 (because both are in [1, n]), the modulus will be 0 only when task_location==current.\n\n                But wait: if n=5, current=1, task_location=6? No, task_location is between 1 and n, so no.\n\n                Therefore, we can use:\n\n                  dist = (task_location - current) % n\n                  if dist < 0: \n                    dist += n   # Actually, the modulus operation already makes it nonnegative, so we don't need this.\n\n                However, in Python, the modulus operation for negative numbers returns a nonnegative value, so we don't need the if.\n\n            But wait: there's an issue. The modulus operation gives the same result as the two-case formula, but note: the two-case formula for task_location < current is n - current + task_location, which is the same as (task_location - current + n) % n? \n\n            Actually, the modulus operation does: \n                (task_location - current) % n = (task_location - current + k*n) % n, where k is chosen so that the result is in [0, n-1]. \n\n            But note: the modulus operation is defined so that the result is in [0, n-1]. However, the distance we want is the minimal steps to move clockwise, which is exactly the modulus result? \n\n            Let me test with an example that requires more than one wrap? Actually, we are only moving clockwise and the ring is fixed. We never need to wrap more than once because the maximum gap is n-1.\n\n            However, wait: the problem does not specify that the tasks are in increasing order of house numbers. They can be arbitrary.\n\n            Example: n=10, current=5, task_location=1: \n              Using modulus: (1-5)%10 = (-4)%10 = 6. \n              Actual steps: 5->6->7->8->9->10->1: 6 steps. Correct.\n\n            Example: n=10, current=5, task_location=10: \n              (10-5)%10=5 -> 5 steps: 5->6->7->8->9->10, correct.\n\n            Example: n=10, current=10, task_location=9: \n              (9-10)%10 = (-1)%10=9 -> 9 steps: 10->1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9? Actually, wait: \n              Steps: \n                10->1 (1), 1->2 (2), 2->3 (3), 3->4 (4), 4->5 (5), 5->6 (6), 6->7 (7), 7->8 (8), 8->9 (9). Correct.\n\n            However, wait: the example above shows that from 10 to 9, the modulus gives 9, but the minimal clockwise steps is 9. \n\n            But note: there is no shorter way because we can only go clockwise.\n\n            Therefore, the distance from current to task_location is (task_location - current) % n, but wait: what if the modulus gives a negative? We've seen that in Python, modulus handles negatives.\n\n            However, note: the modulus operation in Python for (a-b) % n is defined as (a-b) mod n, which is the smallest nonnegative integer congruent to (a-b) modulo n.\n\n            And that is exactly the clockwise steps we need.\n\n          Therefore, we can compute the distance as: \n            dist = (task_location - current) % n\n            But wait, if the modulus is 0, that's correct (no movement). If the modulus is positive, that's the steps.\n\n          However, there's a catch: the modulus operation in Python for (a-b) % n is defined as (a-b) mod n, and that is the minimal nonnegative residue. But note: the clockwise movement from current to task_location is the minimal nonnegative d such that (current + d) ≡ task_location (mod n) and d is in [0, n-1]. \n\n          But wait, is that the same as the actual steps? Yes, because we are moving one step per house and the ring is fixed.\n\n          However, note: the ringroad is one-way, and we are only moving clockwise, so the minimal steps is indeed the smallest nonnegative d such that (current + d) mod n = task_location, but we have to account for the labeling.\n\n          But here's the catch: the modulus operation gives a result in [0, n-1], and the steps we take are exactly that number.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n            total_time = 0\n            current = 1\n            for each task in the list of m tasks:\n                dist = (task - current) % n\n                if dist == 0:\n                    # Then we don't move, but we still update current to task (which is same as current)\n                    pass\n                else:\n                    total_time += dist\n                    current = task\n\n          But wait: what if the modulus result is 0? Then we don't add anything and we update current to task (which is the same). That is correct.\n\n          However, let me test with the provided examples.\n\n          Example 1: Input \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n\n          n=4, m=3, tasks=[3,2,3]\n\n          Step1: current=1, task=3\n            dist = (3-1)%4 = 2 %4 = 2 -> total_time=2, current becomes 3.\n\n          Step2: current=3, task=2\n            dist = (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4 = 3 -> total_time=2+3=5, current becomes 2.\n\n          Step3: current=2, task=3\n            dist = (3-2)%4 = 1 -> total_time=5+1=6, current becomes 3.\n\n          Output: 6, which matches the example.\n\n          Example 2: Input \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n\n          n=4, m=3, tasks=[2,3,3]\n\n          Step1: current=1, task=2\n            dist = (2-1)%4 = 1 -> total_time=1, current=2.\n\n          Step2: current=2, task=3\n            dist = (3-2)%4 = 1 -> total_time=2, current=3.\n\n          Step3: current=3, task=3\n            dist = 0 -> total_time=2, current=3.\n\n          Output: 2, which matches the example.\n\n          However, wait: the example input was given as two strings: \n            ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n          But the second example output is 2.\n\n          Therefore, the code is:\n\n            Read n and m\n            Read the list of m integers\n\n            total_time = 0\n            current = 1\n            for a in task_list:\n                # Compute the distance from current to a\n                # Note: the modulus operation in Python for (a - current) % n is safe.\n                dist = (a - current) % n\n                # However, wait: the modulus operation gives a value in [0, n-1]. But note: the modulus operation in our case is defined for the circular ring, and we have shown that the clockwise steps is the modulus result.\n\n                # But wait: what if the modulus result is 0? Then we don't move. Otherwise, we move.\n\n                total_time += dist\n                current = a\n\n          However, wait: in the second example, the first move from 1 to 2: \n            (2-1)%4 = 1 -> correct.\n            Then from 2 to 3: (3-2)%4=1 -> correct.\n            Then from 3 to 3: 0 -> correct.\n\n          But wait: the example input \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" is expected to output 2, and our total_time is 1+1+0=2.\n\n          Why did the example say: \n            Input: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n            Output: 2\n\n          So our code is correct.\n\n          However, let me reexamine the modulus operation: \n\n            The modulus operation is defined for negative numbers, and we are using (a - current) % n.\n\n          But note: the modulus operation in Python is efficient and works for large n and m (up to 10^5). \n\n          But wait: is there a possibility that the modulus operation is doing an expensive calculation? No, it's a constant time operation.\n\n          Therefore, the code is:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            total_time = 0\n            current = 1\n            for a in tasks:\n                # Calculate the clockwise distance from current to a\n                # We use modulus to account for the circular nature.\n                dist = (a - current) % n\n                # However, note: the modulus operation might give 0, which is correct, but sometimes we might get a negative? No, because modulus n gives nonnegative.\n\n                # But wait: what if (a - current) is negative? Then modulus n gives the positive equivalent. So we are good.\n\n                total_time += dist\n                current = a\n\n            print(total_time)\n\n          Let me test with a bigger example.\n\n          Example: n=5, tasks=[5,1,3]\n          Start at 1.\n\n          Step1: from 1 to 5: (5-1)%5=4 -> total_time=4, current=5.\n          Step2: from 5 to 1: (1-5)%5 = (-4)%5 = 1 -> total_time=5, current=1.\n          Step3: from 1 to 3: (3-1)%5=2 -> total_time=7.\n\n          Now, let's simulate the moves:\n\n          1->2->3->4->5: 4 steps (for 1 to 5)\n          5->1: 1 step (because 5->1 is one step)\n          1->2->3: 2 steps.\n\n          Total: 4+1+2 = 7.\n\n          But wait, the problem says that after completing a task, she is at that house. And the next task must be done from that house. \n\n          However, note: the problem says \"she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i\". So the first task is 5, then the second task is 1, then the third task is 3.\n\n          The simulation is correct.\n\n          But wait, is there a shorter path? \n\n          From 1 to 5: 4 steps (clockwise: 1,2,3,4,5) -> no other way.\n\n          From 5 to 1: 1 step (clockwise: 5->1) -> correct.\n\n          From 1 to 3: 2 steps (clockwise: 1->2->3) -> correct.\n\n          So 7 is correct.\n\n          However, wait: what if we consider the entire circle as a single path? The modulus method is correct.\n\n          But wait: the modulus operation is giving the minimal steps? Yes, because the ring is one-way and we cannot go counterclockwise.\n\n          Therefore, we can submit this code.\n\n          However, note: the modulus operation for (a - current) % n: \n\n            In the example from 5 to 1: \n                (1-5) %5 = (-4)%5 = 1 (because -4 + 5 = 1, and 1 is the remainder).\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          But wait: what if the modulus operation is not giving the minimal steps? \n\n          Let me clarify: \n\n            We are moving from current to a in a circle of n houses. The clockwise distance is defined as the smallest nonnegative integer d such that:\n\n                (current + d) mod n = a   (if we consider the houses as 1-indexed, then we have to adjust the modulus)\n\n          Actually, we mapped the houses to the circle. The movement from current to a is the same as the modulus of (a - current) by n, but we have to account for the fact that the circle has n houses.\n\n          However, note: the modulus operation in our computation is on the linear difference, but the houses are arranged in a circle.\n\n          There is a better way to think: \n\n            We can map the houses to 0-indexed: \n                Let current0 = current-1, a0 = a-1.\n\n            Then the clockwise distance from current0 to a0 is (a0 - current0) % n, but if negative then add n? \n\n            Actually, in 0-indexed, the clockwise distance from current0 to a0 is (a0 - current0) % n, but wait: \n\n            Example: n=5, current=1 (current0=0), a=5 (a0=4): \n                (4-0)%5=4 -> correct.\n\n            Example: current=5 (current0=4), a=1 (a0=0): \n                (0-4)%5 = (-4)%5 = 1 -> but wait, in 0-indexed, the clockwise distance from 4 to 0 should be: \n                    4->0 (which is the next house after 4) -> 1 step.\n\n            But wait, in 0-indexed, the houses are 0,1,2,3,4. The next house after 4 is 0. So the distance from 4 to 0 is 1.\n\n            However, the modulus operation gives 1, which is correct.\n\n            But note: the modulus operation in 0-indexed is the same as in 1-indexed? \n\n            Actually, we don't need to convert to 0-indexed because the modulus operation is defined for the 1-indexed values and the circle size n.\n\n          Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n          However, wait: the modulus operation for (a - current) % n is valid for 1-indexed? \n\n            Because the circle has n houses, and the labels are 1 to n.\n\n            The difference (a - current) might be negative, and then we add n until positive? The modulus operation does that.\n\n          So we'll use the above code.\n\n          But wait: one more example: n=10, current=10, a=9: \n            (9-10)%10 = (-1)%10 = 9 -> 9 steps. Correct.\n\n          However, wait: the example n=10, current=10, a=9: \n            Steps: 10->1 (step1), 1->2 (step2), 2->3 (step3), 3->4 (step4), 4->5 (step5), 5->6 (step6), 6->7 (step7), 7->8 (step8), 8->9 (step9). So 9 steps.\n\n          Therefore, the code is:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            ans = 0\n            cur = 1\n            for a in arr:\n                # Calculate the distance from cur to a\n                # Since the ring is one-way and circular, the distance is (a - cur) % n, but note: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers gives the positive equivalent.\n                # However, wait: what if (a - cur) is positive? Then modulus is the same as the positive value, unless it exceeds n? But since a and cur are in [1, n], the maximum positive is n-1, so modulus doesn't change it.\n\n                # But wait: the modulus operation for positive (a-cur) that is >=n? \n                # Example: n=5, a=10, but wait: a is in [1, n] so a<=n. Similarly, cur<=n. The maximum positive difference is (n-1) - 1 = n-2, which is less than n.\n\n                # Therefore, for positive (a-cur) we don't need modulus? But we do because if a<cur then we get negative.\n\n                # However, we can also write without modulus: \n                #   if a >= cur:\n                #       d = a - cur\n                #   else:\n                #       d = n - cur + a\n\n                # But the modulus operation unifies these two cases.\n\n                # Let me test: \n                #   a>=cur: (a-cur) % n = a-cur (if a-cur < n, which it is because a<=n, cur>=1 -> a-cur <= n-1, and n is the modulus, so the modulus doesn't change the value)\n\n                #   a<cur: (a-cur) is negative, then (a-cur) % n = (a-cur + n) % n, but since a-cur+n is in [0, n-1] (because a>=1, cur<=n, so a-cur+n >= 1-n+n = 1, and <= n-1+n? Actually, a>=1, cur<=n, so a-cur+n >= 1-n+n = 1, and a-cur+n <= n-1+n? Wait, no: a>=1, cur<=n, so the minimum value of (a-cur+n) is (1 - n + n)=1, the maximum is (n-1 - 1 + n) = 2*n-2? \n\n                #   But wait, n is fixed, and a and cur are in [1, n]. So a-cur+n is in [1, 2*n-1]. Then we take modulus n, which would reduce it to [0, n-1]. \n\n                #   However, we know that a-cur+n is at least 1 and at most 2*n-1. Then (a-cur+n) % n = (a-cur+n) - k*n, where k is floor((a-cur+n)/n). \n\n                #   But note: we want the minimal nonnegative d such that (cur+d) mod n = a. \n\n                #   Actually, the modulus operation in this case is giving the correct minimal steps.\n\n                #   But wait, why did the example n=10, current=10, a=9 work? \n                #       (9-10)%10 = (-1)%10 = 9, which is the same as (9-10+10)%10 = (9)%10=9.\n\n                #   However, note: the modulus operation is defined as: (a-b) % n = (a-b) mod n, which is the remainder when dividing (a-b) by n, but with the positive remainder.\n\n                #   Therefore, the modulus operation is correct.\n\n                # We'll stick to the modulus.\n\n                d = (a - cur) % n\n                # But wait: what if the modulus operation returns a value that is greater than the minimal steps? \n\n                # Let me test with a different approach: \n\n                #   The clockwise distance from cur to a is the smallest d>=0 such that (cur + d) mod n = a.\n\n                #   But note: the mapping of houses to the circle: \n                #       After d steps from cur, we are at house (cur + d - 1) % n + 1.\n\n                #   We want (cur + d - 1) % n + 1 = a.\n\n                #   => (cur + d - 1) % n = a - 1\n                #   => (cur - 1 + d) % n = a - 1\n                #   => d ≡ (a - 1 - (cur - 1)) mod n\n                #   => d = (a - cur) % n   [but wait, we are doing modulus in the additive group, but note: the modulus of negative numbers is defined as above]\n\n                #   Actually, the equation: (cur + d) mod n = a   (if we consider the circle without converting to 0-indexed) is not the same as the 0-indexed.\n\n                #   Alternatively, we can think: \n                #       In 1-indexed, the next house after cur is cur+1, unless cur==n then it's 1.\n\n                #   But the modulus operation we are using is on the linear difference, and we are getting the same result as the two-case formula.\n\n                #   Therefore, we'll use the modulus.\n\n                ans += d\n                cur = a\n\n            print(ans)\n\n          However, wait: there is a known issue: \n\n            In some languages, the modulus operation for negative numbers may not be defined as returning a nonnegative value. But in Python it is.\n\n          But wait: the problem constraints say n and m can be up to 10^5. The modulus operation is O(1) and the loop is O(m). So this is efficient.\n\n          Let me run the provided examples.\n\n          Example 1: \n            Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n            n=4, m=3, tasks=[3,2,3]\n            Step1: a=3, cur=1 -> d=(3-1)%4=2, ans=2, cur=3.\n            Step2: a=2, cur=3 -> d=(2-3)%4=(-1)%4=3, ans=5, cur=2.\n            Step3: a=3, cur=2 -> d=(3-2)%4=1, ans=6, cur=3.\n            Output:6\n\n          Example 2:\n            Input: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n            n=4, m=3, tasks=[2,3,3]\n            Step1: a=2, cur=1 -> d= (2-1)%4=1, ans=1, cur=2.\n            Step2: a=3, cur=2 -> d= (3-2)%4=1, ans=2, cur=3.\n            Step3: a=3, cur=3 -> d=0, ans=2, cur=3.\n            Output:2\n\n          It matches.\n\n          However, wait: there's a potential pitfall. The modulus operation is defined as:\n\n            (a - cur) % n\n\n          But what if (a - cur) is negative and the absolute value is huge? But note, a and cur are between 1 and n, so (a-cur) is between -(n-1) and (n-1). So (a-cur) is at most n-1 in absolute value.\n\n          Therefore, the modulus operation is safe.\n\n          But wait: the modulus operation for negative numbers in Python: \n            (-1) % 4 -> 3, which is correct.\n\n          So the code is:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            time = 0\n            current = 1\n            for a",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad. The ringroad consists of `n` houses arranged in a clockwise order, and Xenia starts at house 1. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and she must complete tasks in the given order. Moving between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia moves only in the clockwise direction. The key observation is that the time taken to move from one house to another depends on their positions in the circular arrangement. If the target house is ahead (greater than or equal to the current house), the distance is simply the difference between their positions. If the target house is behind (less than the current house), the distance is calculated by moving from the current house to the end of the ring and then continuing from the start to the target house.\n2. **Insight**: The movement can be efficiently calculated using modulo arithmetic. For any two houses `a` and `current`, the clockwise distance is `(a - current) % n`. This formula works because if `a` is less than `current`, adding `n` to the difference ensures the result is positive and correctly represents the path around the ring.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate through each task, compute the distance from the current position to the task's house using modulo arithmetic, accumulate the total time, and update the current position to the task's house after each move.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ntime = 0\ncurrent = 1\nfor a in tasks:\n    dist = (a - current) % n\n    time += dist\n    current = a\n\nprint(time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Read the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. Then read the list of task locations.\n2. **Time Calculation**: Start from house 1 (initial position). For each task location, compute the clockwise distance from the current position to the task's house using `(a - current) % n`. This handles both cases where the target house is ahead or behind the current position by leveraging modulo arithmetic.\n3. **Update Position**: After moving to the task's house, update the current position to this house for the next iteration.\n4. **Output**: After processing all tasks, print the total accumulated time.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal time by leveraging modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
