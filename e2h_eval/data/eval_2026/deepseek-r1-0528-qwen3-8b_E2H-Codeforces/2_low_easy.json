Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, and then n lines of n characters each.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. All the letters on both diagonals must be the same (but note: the center is shared by both diagonals).\n 2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must be the same letter and different from the diagonal letter.\n\n However, note that the example: \n   Input: 3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw -> Output: YES\n   But: \n        w s w\n        s w s\n        w s w\n\n Here, the diagonals are:\n   Diagonal1: [0][0] = 'w', [1][1]='w', [2][2]='w'\n   Diagonal2: [0][2]='w', [1][1]='w', [2][0]='w'\n\n So the diagonals are all 'w'. Then the rest (the four corners? Actually, in a 3x3, the non-diagonals are the middle row and middle column without the center? \n Actually, non-diagonals are the positions where i != j and i+j != n-1 (if we index from 0). But wait, the condition says: all other squares (not on the diagonals) must contain the same letter that is different.\n\n In the example, the non-diagonal positions are:\n   (0,1): 's', (1,0): 's', (1,2): 's', (2,1): 's'\n\n So they are all 's', which is different from 'w'. Hence, it's YES.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read n and then n lines.\n 2. We'll traverse the grid and collect:\n    - The two diagonals: one from top-left to bottom-right (i == j) and one from top-right to bottom-left (i + j == n-1).\n    - The non-diagonal elements: all the other positions.\n\n 3. Check:\n    a. All characters in the main diagonal (i==j) and anti-diagonal (i+j==n-1) should be the same. \n       However, note that the center (when i=j and also i+j==n-1) is included in both. So we can combine the two diagonals and check if they are all the same letter.\n\n    b. All non-diagonal elements must be the same letter and different from the diagonal letter.\n\n 4. But wait: what if the entire grid is the same letter? Then the non-diagonal would have the same letter as the diagonal, which violates condition (b). So we must ensure the non-diagonal letter is different.\n\n Implementation:\n\n Let grid be the list of strings.\n\n Step 1: Check the two diagonals (without worrying about the center being repeated) and see if they are all the same.\n\n However, note: the problem says the diagonals must be the same. So we can do:\n\n   diagonal_letter = None\n   for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][i] != grid[0][0]:\n            diagonal_letter = None   # But wait, we need to check consistency.\n\n Alternatively, we can combine the two diagonals into one set or check that every element in both diagonals is the same.\n\n Let's do:\n\n   diag1 = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n   diag2 = [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n\n   Now, we want to check that all characters in diag1 and diag2 are the same.\n\n   But note: the center is at index (n//2) for both, so it's the same element. So the entire set of diagonal elements should be the same.\n\n   However, there might be a case where the two diagonals have two different letters? Actually, the condition requires that on both diagonals all letters are the same. But note the center is shared. So if the entire diag1 is 'a' and the entire diag2 is 'a', then it's okay. But if diag1 is 'a' and diag2 is 'b', then we have two different letters on the diagonals.\n\n   Condition (a): both diagonals must have the same letter. So we can say:\n\n   Let d_letter = grid[0][0]   # but wait, the center might be different? Actually, the entire diag1 must be same, and entire diag2 must be same, and the two sets must have the same letter.\n\n   Actually, the problem states: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". It doesn't say the two diagonals must be the same as each other? Let me read again: \n\n   \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n   This could be interpreted as: the main diagonal has one letter, and the anti-diagonal",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given grid of letters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: First, we read the integer `n` which specifies the size of the grid (an odd number). Then, we read the next `n` lines to get the grid itself.\n2. **Check Diagonals**: We collect all characters from both the main diagonal (where row index equals column index) and the anti-diagonal (where row index plus column index equals `n-1`). These characters must all be the same.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Characters**: All characters not on either diagonal must be identical and different from the diagonal characters.\n4. **Output Result**: If both conditions are satisfied, we print \"YES\"; otherwise, we print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        grid.append(input().strip())\n    \n    diag_letters = set()\n    for i in range(n):\n        diag_letters.add(grid[i][i])\n        diag_letters.add(grid[i][n-1-i])\n    \n    if len(diag_letters) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    d_char = next(iter(diag_letters))\n    \n    non_diag_set = set()\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            non_diag_set.add(grid[i][j])\n            \n    if len(non_diag_set) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    non_d_char = next(iter(non_diag_set))\n    \n    if non_d_char == d_char:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the size of the grid `n` and then reads each line of the grid into a list of strings.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: It checks all characters along both diagonals (from top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left). If these characters are not all the same, it immediately outputs \"NO\".\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: For characters not on either diagonal, it ensures they are all the same and different from the diagonal characters. If any character on the non-diagonal does not meet this condition, it outputs \"NO\".\n4. **Result Output**: If both checks pass, the code outputs \"YES\", confirming the grid forms an \"X\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the conditions by leveraging sets to check uniformity and differences between diagonal and non-diagonal characters, ensuring correctness with minimal computational overhead.",
