After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are reading the first line to get n and m.\n Then, we read the next n lines, each containing a string of m characters (without spaces).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We'll read the input as described.\n 2. For each subject (column), we can determine the maximum mark (from '1' to '9') for that subject.\n    However, note: if there are multiple students with the same maximum mark in a subject, then all those students are best in that subject.\n\n 3. But note: a student is successful if there exists at least one subject in which he is the best.\n\n Approach:\n Let's create a list `students` where each element is a string (each row) of length m.\n\n We can do:\n   max_marks = [0] * m   # but actually we don't know the max until we compute per column.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute for each column j the maximum mark (as integer or character? But note: the marks are from '1' to '9')\n   For j in range(m):\n        col = [students[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n        max_col = max(col)   # This will give the maximum character\n\n Then, for each student i, we check for any subject j such that students[i][j] == max_col (for that j).\n\n However, note: the problem says \"best\" means no one has a higher mark. So if the max_col is the highest, then having that mark makes the student best for that subject.\n\n But wait: what if two students have the same highest mark? Then both are best in that subject.\n\n So we can do:\n\n   max_per_subject = [max(column) for column in zip(*students)]\n\n Then, for each student i, we look at his marks: \n   student_i_marks = list(students[i])\n   Then, check if there exists at least one j such that student_i_marks[j] == max_per_subject[j]\n\n But note: the example input: \n      Input: ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112']\n      This gives:\n          n=3, m=3\n          students = ['223', '232', '112']\n\n      Let's break down:\n        Subject0: ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2'\n        Subject1: ['2','3','1'] -> max is '3'\n        Subject2: ['3','2','2'] -> max is '3'\n\n      Now, for student0 ('223'):\n          Subject0: '2' == '2' -> yes, so he is best in subject0.\n          So student0 is successful.\n\n      Student1 ('232'):\n          Subject0: '2' == '2' -> yes, so successful.\n\n      Student2 ('112'):\n          Subject0: '1' != '2'\n          Subject1: '1' != '3'\n          Subject2: '2' != '3' -> not successful.\n\n      Thus, output 2.\n\n 4. However, note the second sample:\n        Input: ['3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n        n=3, m=5\n        students = ['91728', '11828', '11111']\n\n        Compute max_per_subject for each column (each of the 5 subjects):\n\n        Subject0: ['9','1','1'] -> max is '9'\n        Subject1: ['1','1','1'] -> max is '1'\n        Subject2: ['7','8','1'] -> max is '8'\n        Subject3: ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2'\n        Subject4: ['8','8','1'] -> max is '8'\n\n        Now, check each student:\n\n        Student0: '91728'\n            Subject0: '9' == '9' -> successful (so we can break early)\n\n        Student1: '11828'\n            Subject1: '1' == '1' -> successful\n\n        Student2: '11111'\n            Check each subject:\n                Subject0: '1' != '9'\n                Subject1: '1' == '1' -> successful\n\n        Therefore, all three are successful.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Read n and m from the first line.\n\n   Then read the next n lines.\n\n   Then, we can use:\n        grades = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n   Then, transpose the list of strings to get columns. Alternatively, we can use zip(*grades) to get the columns.\n\n   Let max_marks = [max(col) for col in zip(*grades)]\n\n   Then, for each student i (each string in grades), we check:\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grades[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                mark this student as successful and break inner loop.\n\n   Count the number of students that are successful.\n\n Example code:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   grades = []\n   for i in range(n):\n        grades.append(input().strip())\n\n   # But note: the input might be given as a single string? Actually, the problem says the first line is two integers, then n lines.\n\n   However, the example input is provided as: \n        Input: ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n   But when we read from stdin, we do:\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n   However, the problem states that the first line contains two integers, and then n lines. So:\n\n        first_line = input().split()\n        n = int(first_line[0]); m = int(first_line[1])\n        grades = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            grades.append(input().strip())\n\n   But note: the example input in the problem is given as two separate examples. We are to read from stdin.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might give the entire input in one go? The example input is shown as a list of two strings, but in reality, we have two test cases? \n\n   Actually, the problem statement says: \n        Input: \n            ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n   This is just an example. We are to read from standard input.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", meaning we are writing a program that reads from stdin and writes to stdout.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   But wait: what if the input is large? n, m up to 100, so it's small.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grades = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            grades.append(input().strip())\n\n        # Transpose the grades to get columns\n        # Using zip(*grades) to get the columns\n        if n > 0 and m > 0:\n            max_marks = [max(col) for col in zip(*grades)]\n        else:\n            # If there are no students or no subjects, then no successful students?\n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n\n        count_success = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            successful = False\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grades[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                    successful = True\n                    break\n            if successful:\n                count_success += 1\n\n        print(count_success)\n\n   Let's test with the first example:\n\n        Input: \n            n=3, m=3\n            grades = ['223', '232', '112']\n\n        max_marks = [ max('2','2','1') -> '2', max('2','3','1') -> '3', max('3','2','2') -> '3' ]\n\n        For student0: '223'\n            j0: '2' == '2' -> True -> successful.\n\n        For student1: '232'\n            j0: '2' == '2' -> True -> successful.\n\n        For student2: '112'\n            j0: '1' != '2'\n            j1: '1' != '3'\n            j2: '2' != '3' -> not successful.\n\n        Output: 2 -> correct.\n\n   Second example:\n\n        n=3, m=5\n        grades = ['91728', '11828', '11111']\n\n        max_marks = [max('9','1','1') -> '9', max('1','1','1') -> '1', max('7','8','1') -> '8', max('2','2','1') -> '2', max('8','8','1') -> '8']\n\n        Student0: '91728'\n            j0: '9'=='9' -> True -> successful.\n\n        Student1: '11828'\n            j0: '1' != '9'\n            j1: '1' == '1' -> True -> successful.\n\n        Student2: '11111'\n            j0: '1' != '9'\n            j1: '1' == '1' -> True -> successful.\n\n        Output: 3 -> correct.\n\n   However, note: the example input was given as a list of two strings, but our program expects two lines for the first example and five for the second.\n\n   But wait: the example input in the problem is shown as:\n\n        Input: \n            ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n   This is just two test cases. In competitive programming, we usually read one test case per run.\n\n   However, if the problem intended to have multiple test cases, then we would need to adjust. But the problem says:\n\n        The first input line contains two integers n and m ... Next n lines ...\n\n   So we are reading one test case.\n\n   But the example input is provided as two separate examples. Our program should work for one test case.\n\n   Since the problem does not specify multiple test cases, we assume one.\n\n   However, let me check the problem statement: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and the example input is given as two strings.\n\n   Actually, the example input format is:\n\n        Input: \n            ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n   This might be confusing. But note: the problem says \"Print the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\"\n\n   So we are to output one number per test case. But the example input has two test cases. \n\n   Wait, actually the example input is two separate examples. In many competitive programming problems, the input may consist of multiple test cases, but the problem statement here does not specify that.\n\n   Looking again: the input description says \"The first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook.\"\n\n   So one test case.\n\n   But the example input is given as two separate strings. This is just for illustration of two different examples.\n\n   How should we handle the input? The problem says to read from stdin.\n\n   We assume that the input is given as:\n\n        First line: n and m\n        Then n lines, each of m characters (without spaces)\n\n   So our code is correct for one test case.\n\n   However, if we are to process multiple test cases (like the example input is two test cases), then we would need to read until EOF.\n\n   But the problem does not specify multiple test cases. It says \"the first input line\", implying one set.\n\n   Let me re-read: \"The first input line contains two integers n and m\". Then the next n lines.\n\n   Therefore, we only read one test case.\n\n   But the example input is provided as two test cases. This might be an error in the problem statement.\n\n   However, looking at the example output: ['2', '3'].\n\n   If the problem intended multiple test cases, then we would have to read until EOF.\n\n   Clarification: In competitive programming, sometimes there are multiple test cases. The problem says \"The first input line\", but what if there are multiple?\n\n   Since the constraints are small (n, m <= 100) and the problem doesn't specify, we assume one test case.\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as a list of two strings. How would we run the program for two test cases?\n\n   Actually, the example input is two separate inputs. In typical competition, the program is run once and reads one test case.\n\n   The problem says \"Print the single number\", so for one test case.\n\n   However, the example input is two test cases. This might be a mistake. Or perhaps the problem expects to read from a file that contains multiple test cases?\n\n   But the problem statement does not say anything about multiple test cases.\n\n   Let me check the constraints: n, m between 1 and 100. There is no indication of multiple test cases.\n\n   I think the problem is intended for one test case.\n\n   But the example input is provided as two test cases. This might be because the problem setter included two examples.\n\n   In summary, we assume one test case.\n\n   However, to be safe, we can consider the possibility of multiple test cases if the input ends with EOF.\n\n   But the problem does not specify, so we stick to one test case.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grades = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            grades.append(input().strip())\n\n        # If n==0, then we don't have any student, so no successful student.\n        if n == 0:\n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n\n        max_marks = [max(zip(*grades)[j]) for j in range(m)]   # Alternatively, we did above by transposing and then taking max per column.\n\n        Actually, the above is equivalent to: max_marks = [max(col) for col in zip(*grades)]\n\n        Then, for each student, check.\n\n   But wait, let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \n            3 3\n            223\n            232\n            112\n\n        Output: 2\n\n   Example 2:\n        Input:\n            3 5\n            91728\n            11828\n            11111\n\n        Output: 3\n\n   However, note: the example input is given as a string that contains both test cases. We cannot run two test cases with one program without knowing how to separate.\n\n   But the problem says: \"The first input line\" for each test case. \n\n   Actually, the problem statement does not specify multiple test cases, so we assume one.\n\n   If the problem intended multiple test cases, they would have said so.\n\n   Therefore, we output the code for one test case.\n\n   But wait: the example input in the problem is given as two separate strings. This might be because the problem setter included two examples. \n\n   However, in competitive programming, we must read from stdin until the end of file. \n\n   The problem says: \"The first input line contains two integers n and m\", meaning the first line is for the current test case.\n\n   How do we know when to stop? The problem doesn't say. \n\n   Since the constraints are small, and the problem doesn't specify multiple test cases, we assume one.\n\n   But if we want to handle multiple test cases, we can read until there is no more input.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Print the single number\", meaning one number per test case.\n\n   And the example input is two test cases. \n\n   Let me see: the example input is:\n\n        ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n   This is two separate test cases. But in a typical competition, the input might be:\n\n        3 3\n        223\n        232\n        112\n        3 5\n        91728\n        11828\n        11111\n\n   Then we have two test cases. \n\n   How to handle?\n\n   The problem says: \"The first input line contains two integers n and m\", so the next two integers are the first test case. Then after the next n lines, the next line is the start of the next test case.\n\n   But the problem statement does not specify the number of test cases.\n\n   Since the problem statement is ambiguous, I will assume that there is exactly one test case.\n\n   However, to be safe, we can read until EOF and process each test case.\n\n   Steps for multiple test cases:\n\n        while True:\n            try:\n                n, m = map(int, input().split())\n                grades = []\n                for i in range(n):\n                    grades.append(input().strip())\n                # process this test case and print the result\n            except EOFError:\n                break\n\n   But the problem does not specify multiple test cases, so we cannot be sure.\n\n   Looking at the constraints: n, m from 1 to 100, and the example input is two test cases.\n\n   Since the problem statement says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", and the example input has two test cases, I suspect the problem setter intended multiple test cases.\n\n   However, the problem statement does not explicitly say \"There are multiple test cases\".\n\n   Let me check the problem statement again: it says \"The first input line contains two integers n and m\". \n\n   Without saying \"until EOF\", it's ambiguous.\n\n   But note: the problem is from a competition, and many competitions use multiple test cases.\n\n   How to decide?\n\n   Since the problem statement does not specify, and the example input is given as two separate test cases, I'll assume multiple test cases until EOF.\n\n   But wait, the example output is given as two numbers: ['2','3']. So we must output two numbers for two test cases.\n\n   However, the problem says \"Print the single number\", meaning one per test case. So if there are two test cases, we output two numbers.\n\n   How? The problem does not specify whether to output all numbers for all test cases or one after the other.\n\n   In competitive programming, typically we output one result per test case, and if there are multiple, we output them in order.\n\n   But the problem does not specify.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, I'll stick to the original requirement: read one test case.\n\n   But the example input is two test cases. \n\n   Alternatively, the example input might be provided as:\n\n        Input:\n            3 3\n            223\n            232\n            112\n        Output:\n            2\n\n        Then another test case:\n\n            3 5\n            91728\n            11828\n            11111\n        Output:\n            3\n\n   And we are to write a program that handles one test case and then exits.\n\n   But the problem statement says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", and the example input is two test cases. \n\n   Since the problem does not specify the exact input method (whether one or multiple test cases), and the constraints are small, we can choose one.\n\n   However, the problem setter's example input is two test cases. \n\n   I think the intended solution is to handle multiple test cases.\n\n   Let me check the problem statement: \"Print the single number\" — but that refers to each test case.\n\n   Since the problem does not specify the number of test cases, we must read until EOF.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"The first input line\", meaning the first line of the entire input is the first test case's n and m.\n\n   Then, the next n lines for the first test case, then the next test case starts.\n\n   So we must read until there is no more input.\n\n   Therefore, I change the code to handle multiple test cases.\n\n   Code for multiple test cases:\n\n        while True:\n            data = input().split()\n            if not data:\n                continue   # if empty line, skip\n            n = int(data[0])\n            m = int(data[1])\n            grades = []\n            for i in range(n):\n                grades.append(input().strip())\n\n            # Then process the test case.\n\n            # If we get an EOFError when trying to read the next line for grades, then we break.\n\n            # But the input() function raises EOFError at the end of file.\n\n            # Alternatively, we can use try-except.\n\n        However, the problem says the first line is two integers, so we must read the first line.\n\n        But what if the input ends after the first test case? Then we break.\n\n        How about:\n\n            import sys\n\n            data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n            # Then, we can parse each test case.\n\n        But the problem says to read from stdin.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            lines = []\n            try:\n                while True:\n                    line = input().strip()\n                    if line == '':\n                        continue\n                    n, m = map(int, line.split())\n                    # Then read n lines\n                    grades = []\n                    for i in range(n):\n                        grades.append(input().strip())\n                    # Process and output\n            except EOFError:\n                pass\n\n        But the first line might not be empty. Also, we are reading the first line as the first non-empty line? \n\n        Actually, the problem says the first input line is the two integers.\n\n        So the first line is always present.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify that there are multiple test cases, so we cannot assume.\n\n        But the example input is two test cases, so we must be prepared for multiple.\n\n        Since the problem statement does not specify, and to match the example input (which is two test cases), we assume multiple test cases.\n\n        However, the problem statement says: \"The first input line\", so if there is only one test case, then we read one line and then n lines.\n\n        If there are multiple, then we read the first line, then n lines, then the next line (which is the start of the next test case).\n\n        So the structure is:\n\n            Line 1: n1 m1\n            Next n1 lines: the gradebook for first test case.\n\n            Then Line n1+2: n2 m2\n            Next n2 lines: the gradebook for second test case.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            import sys\n\n            data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n            index = 0\n            results = []\n            while index < len(data):\n                if data[index].strip() == \"\":\n                    index += 1\n                    continue\n                parts = data[index].split()\n                n = int(parts[0])\n                m = int(parts[1])\n                index += 1\n                grades = []\n                for i in range(n):\n                    # If we reach the end of the file, break.\n                    if index >= len(data):\n                        break\n                    grades.append(data[index].strip())\n                    index += 1\n\n                # Now process the test case with n, m and grades.\n\n                # Transpose grades to get columns\n                # Then compute max_marks for each column\n                max_marks = [max(col) for col in zip(*grades)]\n\n                count_success = 0\n                for i in range(n):\n                    successful = False\n                    for j in range(m):\n                        if grades[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                            successful = True\n                            break\n                    if successful:\n                        count_success += 1\n\n                results.append(count_success)\n\n            # Then, we output each result on its own line? Or the problem expects one output per test case, but the example output is two separate numbers.\n\n            # The problem says \"Print the single number\", meaning for each test case we print one number.\n\n            # But the example output is given as ['2','3'], so two numbers.\n\n            # However, the example input is two test cases, so we output two numbers.\n\n            # But the problem does not specify whether to output all numbers at once or one after the other.\n\n            # Typically, in competitive programming, we output each test case's result immediately or collect and then output.\n\n            # Since the problem says \"Print the single number\", we can print one number per test case.\n\n            # But the example output is two numbers. However, the example input is two test cases.\n\n            # Actually, the example output is given as ['2','3'] meaning two separate outputs.\n\n            # But note: the problem says \"Print the single number\", so we are printing one number per test case.\n\n            # However, the problem does not specify the output format for multiple test cases.\n\n            # According to many competitions, we output each result on a new line.\n\n            # So we can do:\n\n            for res in results:\n                print(res)\n\n        But wait, the example input is provided as two strings. How would we run this? We would have to provide two test cases.\n\n        Alternatively, we can output each result as we compute.\n\n        But the problem does not specify the order. We are reading sequentially.\n\n        However, the problem says \"The first input line\", so we must process in order.\n\n        But the example output is two numbers. The first test case output is 2, the second is 3.\n\n        So we output:\n\n            2\n            3\n\n        But the example output is given as ['2','3'].\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, the problem statement says \"Print the single number\", meaning for the given test case. \n\n        But if there are multiple test cases, we print each single number (on separate lines) for each test case.\n\n        But note: the problem statement does not specify the number of test cases.\n\n        Since we are assuming multiple test cases, we output one number per test case, each on its own line.\n\n        However, the problem statement does not say \"multiple test cases\", so we must be cautious.\n\n        But the example input is two test cases, so we must handle multiple.\n\n        But the problem constraints say n, m from 1 to 100, and the input might have up to 100 test cases? (if n and m are small, then the total input lines is manageable)\n\n        But note: the total number of lines is (number_of_test_cases) + sum_{i}(n_i) \n\n        And the total n_i (students) is at most 100 per test case, and the number of test cases is not specified, but the total lines is bounded by 100 * (number of test cases) + (number of test cases) which is acceptable.\n\n        However, without knowing the number of test cases, we assume until EOF.\n\n        But the problem does not specify EOF, so we rely on the input format.\n\n        Alternatively, we can read until there's no more input.\n\n        Let me change the code to use:\n\n            while True:\n                try:\n                    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n                    grades = []\n                    for i in range(n):\n                        grades.append(input().strip())\n                    # Process the test case\n                    max_marks = [max(col) for col in zip(*grades)]\n                    count_success = 0\n                    for i in range(n):\n                        for j in range(m):\n                            if grades[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                                count_success += 1\n                                break   # break inner loop, but we are counting the student once, so break inner and then mark the student as successful and then break outer?\n                        # But wait, we are counting the student as soon as we find one subject. So we can break the inner and then move to next student.\n\n                    # Actually, we did above: we break the inner loop and then if we found one, we count the student and then move to the next.\n\n                    # Correction: in the above we broke the inner loop and then checked if we found one. But the above code already counts the student.\n\n                    # But wait, in the above code we break the inner loop and then we break out of the inner and then check the flag for the student.\n\n                    # However, in the code above we had a flag and then counted at the end of the student. \n\n                    # Let me rewrite the counting without the flag:\n\n                    # Option 1: use a flag per student.\n\n                    # Option 2: for each student, check if any subject j satisfies the condition.\n\n                    # We did:\n\n                    #   successful = False\n                    #   for j in range(m):\n                    #       if condition: successful = True; break\n                    #   if successful: count_success += 1\n\n                    # But now we are inside the while loop for test cases.\n\n                    # We can keep the same logic.\n\n                    # Let me do:\n\n                    count_success = 0\n                    for i in range(n):\n                        successful = False\n                        for j in range(m):\n                            if grades[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                                successful = True\n                                break\n                        if successful:\n                            count_success += 1\n\n                    print(count_success)\n\n                except EOFError:\n                    break\n\n        This will output each test case's answer on a separate line.\n\n        However, the problem statement says \"Print the single number\", meaning one number per test case, and the example output is two numbers (one for each test case) in the example.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        But note: the example input is provided as two test cases. We must read the entire input until EOF.\n\n        But the problem does not specify EOF, so we rely on the input format.\n\n        However, the problem says the input is from stdin, so we use input().\n\n        But wait: the example input is given as a list of two strings. In a real competition, the input is provided from a file or pipe.\n\n        We assume the input is given in the required format.\n\n        Let me test with the first example as one test case:\n\n            Input: \n                3 3\n                223\n                232\n                112\n\n            Output: 2\n\n        Then, if we run the program again with the second example:\n\n            Input:\n                3 5\n                91728\n                11828\n                11111\n\n            Output: 3\n\n        But wait, the problem example input is two test cases in one run. So we need to run the program once and feed it two test cases.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            $ cat input.txt | python3 solution.py\n\n        Where input.txt contains:\n\n            3 3\n            223\n            232\n            112\n            3 5\n            91728\n            11828\n            11111\n\n        Then the program should output:\n\n            2\n            3\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        But the problem statement says \"Print the single number\", and we are printing two numbers. \n\n        However, the problem statement does not specify that there is only one test case.\n\n        Given the example input has two test cases, we assume multiple.\n\n        Final code for multiple test cases:\n\n            while True:\n                try:\n                    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n                    grades = []\n                    for i in range(n):\n                        grades.append(input().strip())\n                    # If we get an empty string for a grade line, we skip? But the problem says each line has m characters.\n\n                    # Compute max_marks for each column\n                    if n == 0 or m == 0:\n                        print(0)\n                        continue\n\n                    # Transpose the grades to get columns\n                    # Using zip(*grades) gives tuples of characters for each column.\n                    max_marks = [max(col) for col in zip(*grades)]\n\n                    count_success = 0\n                    for i in range(n):\n                        successful = False\n                        for j in range(m):\n                            if grades[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                                successful = True\n                                break\n                        if successful:\n                            count_success += 1\n\n                    print(count_success)\n\n                except EOFError:\n                    break\n\n        But wait: what if the input has empty lines? The problem says the gradebook has n lines each of m characters.\n\n        We assume no empty lines.\n\n        However, the input() function returns an empty string for an empty line. Then split() on an empty string returns []. Then n, m = map(int, []) will throw an error.\n\n        We can skip empty lines at the beginning of a test case? \n\n        But the problem says the first line is the two integers, so we shouldn't have an empty line.\n\n        But to be safe, we can:\n\n            while True:\n                try:\n                    line = input().strip()\n                    if line == '':\n                        continue\n                    n, m = map(int, line.split())\n                    grades = []\n                    for i in range(n):\n                        # Skip empty lines in the gradebook? The problem says each line has m characters.\n                        s = input().strip()\n                        while s == '':\n                            s = input().strip()\n                        grades.append(s)\n                    # Then process\n\n        However, the problem does not mention empty lines.\n\n        But the constraints say the marks are from 1 to 9, and each line has m characters.\n\n        So we assume no empty lines.\n\n        We'll keep the simple version.\n\n        Let me submit the multiple test case version.\n\n        But note: the problem statement does not specify multiple test cases, but the example input is two test cases.\n\n        This is the best we can do.\n\n        However, if the judge uses one test case, then our program will still work because it breaks at EOF.\n\n        But if the judge provides one test case, then we read one test case and break at the next attempt to read.\n\n        But wait, after reading one test case, we try to read the next test case and get an EOFError.\n\n        Then we break and output only one test case.\n\n        That is correct.\n\n        Therefore, we output the code below.\n\n        Important: We assume that the input is given in the format described, and we read until EOF.\n\n        However, there's a catch: the input() function in Python might not be the best for very large inputs, but n, m <= 100, so the total lines is at most 100 * (number of test cases). Since the number of test cases is not bounded by the problem, but the total input size is limited by the system, we assume it's acceptable.\n\n        Let me run the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1:\n\n            Input: \n                3 3\n                223\n                232\n                112\n\n            Output: 2\n\n        Example 2:\n\n            Input:\n                3 5\n                91728\n                11828\n                11111\n\n            Output: 3\n\n        Example with two test cases:\n\n            Input:\n                3 3\n                223\n                232\n                112\n                3 5\n                91728\n                11828\n                11111\n\n            Output:\n                2\n                3\n\n        This meets the example.\n\n        But wait, the example output is given as ['2','3'] meaning two numbers. Our program outputs two numbers (each on a separate line).\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        However, the problem says \"Print the single number\", and we are printing one number per test case. \n\n        We are done.\n\n        Note: There is a possibility that the judge expects one test case only. But the example input is two test cases, so we follow the example.\n\n        If the judge only provides one test case, then we output one number.\n\n        We are good.\n\n        Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n        One more edge: n=0 or m=0.\n\n        According to the constraints, n, m>=1, so we don't need to worry.\n\n        But let's keep the code robust.\n\n        We'll add a condition for n==0 or m==0, then output 0 and continue.\n\n        Actually, if n==0, then we have no students, so no successful student.\n\n        Similarly, if m==0, then no subjects, so no successful student.\n\n        But the constraint says at least 1, so we can skip.\n\n        Code:\n\n            while True:\n                try:\n                    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n                    if n == 0 or m == 0:\n                        print(0)\n                        continue\n\n                    grades = []\n                    for i in range(n):\n                        grades.append(input().strip())\n\n                    # Transpose the grades to get columns\n                    max_marks = [max(col) for col in zip(*grades)]\n\n                    count_success = 0\n                    for i in range(n):\n                        successful = False\n                        for j in range(m):\n                            if grades[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                                successful = True\n                                break\n                        if successful:\n                            count_success += 1\n\n                    print(count_success)\n\n                except EOFError:\n                    break\n\n        But wait, the input() might raise an EOFError when reading the n and m, or when reading the grades.\n\n        We catch EOFError at the top level, but if we are reading n and m and get EOF, then we break.\n\n        However, the problem says the first line is n and m, so if we get EOF at the first line, then there is no test case.\n\n        Then we break without processing.\n\n        But the problem says the first input line contains two integers, so we expect at least one line.\n\n        But if the input is empty, then we break.\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        We'll run the code",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves processing a gradebook where each student's marks across multiple subjects are given. For each subject, we need to find the highest mark achieved by any student. A student is successful if they have the highest mark in at least one subject.\n2. **Intuition**: For each subject, identify the maximum mark. Then, for each student, check if they have the maximum mark in any subject. If they do, they are marked as successful.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Reading Input**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m), followed by the gradebook data.\n   - **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), determine the highest mark.\n   - **Checking Successful Students**: For each student, check if their mark in any subject matches the highest mark for that subject. If yes, count them as successful.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each student and each subject once, leading to a time complexity of O(n*m), which is efficient given the constraints (n, m ≤ 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grades = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            grades.append(input().strip())\n        \n        if n == 0 or m == 0:\n            print(0)\n            continue\n            \n        max_marks = [max(col) for col in zip(*grades)]\n        \n        count_success = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            successful = False\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grades[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                    successful = True\n                    break\n            if successful:\n                count_success += 1\n                \n        print(count_success)\n        \n    except EOFError:\n        break\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of students (n) and subjects (m) first. Then, it reads each student's marks as strings.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: Using the `zip` function, the code transposes the gradebook to process columns (subjects) individually. The maximum mark for each subject is stored in `max_marks`.\n3. **Checking Successful Students**: For each student, the code checks if their mark in any subject matches the highest mark for that subject. If found, the student is counted as successful.\n4. **Output**: The total number of successful students is printed for each test case. The loop continues until there is no more input (EOFError is caught to exit gracefully).\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each student's marks against the highest marks in each subject, ensuring optimal performance and correctness.",
