Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from standard input.\n The idea is:\n 1. Combine the first two strings (guest name and host name) and count the total frequency of each letter.\n 2. Compare the frequency of letters in the third string (the pile) with the combined frequency of the first two.\n 3. If the two frequencies match exactly, then we output \"YES\", otherwise \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the problem says that there should be no extra letters and no missing letters.\n\n Steps:\n - Read the three lines and strip any newline characters.\n - Concatenate the first two strings to form the target string.\n - Count the frequency of each character in the target string and in the third string.\n - If the counts for every letter in the target string are the same as in the pile (and also the pile doesn't have any extra letters), then it's a match.\n\n But note: what if the pile has an extra letter? Then the pile's frequency will have some letters with higher counts than needed, or maybe a letter not in the target?\n We can do: \n   For each letter in the target, check that the pile has at least that count.\n   Also, after removing the required letters, if there are any leftover letters, then it's invalid.\n\n Alternatively, we can simply compare the sorted list of the concatenated guest and host string and the sorted list of the pile.\n\n Example: \n   Input: ['SANTACLAUS', 'DEDMOROZ', 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'] \n   Combined: 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ'\n   Pile: 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\n But wait, let me check: \n   Guest: SANTACLAUS -> 10 letters\n   Host:  DEDMOROZ -> 8 letters\n   Total: 18 letters.\n\n   Pile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> Let's count: \n        S: appears in both? Actually, let's break down:\n\n However, the example input is given as a string with newlines, so we need to split by lines.\n\n Another approach: \n   We can use collections.Counter\n\n Steps:\n   s1 = first line.strip()\n   s2 = second line.strip()\n   s3 = third line.strip()\n\n   total_letters = s1 + s2\n   if Counter(total_letters) == Counter(s3):\n        print(\"YES\")\n   else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n But wait, what if the pile has more letters than the total_letters? \n   Counter will only consider the letters in s3. And if there is an extra letter, then the Counter for that letter in s3 would be higher, and the comparison would fail.\n\n Similarly, if the pile is missing a letter, then the Counter for that letter in s3 would be less than in total_letters, and the comparison would fail.\n\n Therefore, this method works.\n\n However, note: the problem says the letters are uppercase Latin letters and the length is at most 100, so using Counter is efficient.\n\n Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1:\n   Guest: 'SANTACLAUS'\n   Host: 'DEDMOROZ'\n   Combined: 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ'\n\n   Pile: 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\n   Let's break down the combined string and the pile:\n\n   Combined: \n        S: 1, A:2, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:2, M:1, O:1, R:1, Z:1\n\n   Pile: \n        S: 1, A:2, N:1, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, L:1, C:1, U:1, ... wait, let me count again.\n\n   Actually, the example input is given as a single string with newlines. The sample input is:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n   But note: the example output is YES.\n\n   However, the example input format in the problem is:\n\n        Input:\n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   So, we are reading three lines.\n\n   But wait, the example input in the note is:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n   This is one string that has three lines. But our program reads three lines.\n\n   Let me write the example:\n\n        Line1: 'SANTACLAUS'\n        Line2: 'DEDMOROZ'\n        Line3: 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\n   Now, the combined string is 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ'\n\n   Now, the pile string is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\n   Let's count the pile string:\n\n        S: 1 (from SANTA) and then another S? Actually, let's break it down:\n\n        S: appears at the beginning: S, then in SANTA (so one more) -> wait, let me write the pile:\n\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n        Breakdown:\n          S: appears 1 (at the start) and then in CLAUS? There is one S at the end? \n          Actually, let's count:\n\n          S: 1 (from SANTA) and then in CLAUS? There is one S in CLAUS? No, CLAUS has one S? \n          Wait, the pile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n          S: \n            index0: 'S'\n            Then in 'CLAUS' at the end: 'CLAUS' has an 'S' at the last? \n            So S: 2?\n\n          Let me recount manually:\n\n          SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n          S: positions 0, and then in CLAUS (if we consider the word CLAUS, the letters are C, L, A, U, S -> so yes, one S at the end.\n\n          So S: 2.\n\n          But in the combined string (SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ): \n            SANTACLAUS: has one S (at the beginning)\n            DEDMOROZ: has no S.\n\n          So combined string has 1 S.\n\n          This means the example input provided in the problem note does not match the example explanation.\n\n  Let me check the example again from the problem statement:\n\n      Input example 1: \n          ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n      But the example output is \"YES\".\n\n      Now, wait: the example input is actually:\n\n          First line: 'SANTACLAUS'\n          Second line: 'DEDMOROZ'\n          Third line: 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\n      And the expected output is \"YES\".\n\n      However, my manual count for S in the pile is 2 and in the combined is 1 -> so they don't match.\n\n  But wait, the example in the problem note is:\n\n      Input:\n          SANTACLAUS\n          DEDMOROZ\n          SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n      And the output is YES.\n\n  Let me double-check the example:\n\n      Guest: SANTACLAUS -> letters: S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S -> wait, actually:\n\n      SANTACLAUS: \n          S:1, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n      Host: DEDMOROZ: \n          D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n      Combined: \n          S:1+0=1, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1.\n\n      Now, the pile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n      Let me write the pile without spaces: \n          S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S\n\n      Now, count for S: \n          First S, then in CLAUS (which is C, L, A, U, S) -> so two S's.\n\n      So the pile has two S's, but the combined needs only one.\n\n      This suggests that the example might be wrong? \n\n  Alternatively, let me read the problem statement again: \n\n      \"In the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.\"\n\n  So, the example input is:\n\n      First line: 'SANTACLAUS'\n      Second line: 'DEDMOROZ'\n      Third line: 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\n  But wait, the third line is the pile. \n\n  How many letters are in the combined names?\n\n      len('SANTACLAUS') = 10\n      len('DEDMOROZ') = 8\n      Total = 18\n\n  The third line: 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS' has 18 letters? Let me count:\n\n      SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> \n          S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S -> 18 characters.\n\n  Now, let me recount the frequency of the combined:\n\n      S: 1 (from guest) + 0 (host) = 1\n      A: 3 (guest: SANTA has two A's? Actually, SANTACLAUS: S,A,N,T,A,C,L,A,U,S -> A appears at positions 1,4,6 -> three times? Actually, no: \n          SANTACLAUS: \n            S:1, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, and the host: DEDMOROZ: no A -> so A:3.\n\n      Now, the pile: \n          S: 2 (as above)\n          A: 3 (because: SANTA has two A's and then CLAUS has one A? Let me see: \n                S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S\n                A: at index1, index4, and then index15 (the A in CLAUS) -> so A:3.\n\n      Now, for S: the combined needs 1, but the pile has 2 -> so it's an extra S.\n\n  But wait, the example output is YES.\n\n  There must be a misunderstanding.\n\n  Let me check the example again: the example input is given as:\n\n      ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n  But note: the example input is a list of three strings? Actually, the problem says:\n\n      The input file consists of three lines.\n\n  So, the example input is three lines:\n\n      Line1: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n      Line2: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n      Line3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n  However, the example output is YES.\n\n  I think I made a mistake in the guest name: \n\n      Guest: SANTACLAUS -> \n          S A N T A C L A U S -> that's 10 letters.\n\n      Let me break down the guest name:\n\n          S: 1\n          A: 3 (positions 1,4,7)\n          N: 1\n          T: 1\n          C: 1\n          L: 1\n          U: 1\n\n      Host: DEDMOROZ -> \n          D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n      Now, the pile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n      Let me break down the pile:\n\n          S: 2 (first letter and last letter)\n          A: 3 (second, fifth, and then in CLAUS: the fourth letter of CLAUS is A? Actually, CLAUS: C, L, A, U, S -> so the A is the third letter in CLAUS, which is the 15th overall? \n          But wait, the pile is: \n              S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S\n\n          So, A's are at:\n            index1: A\n            index4: A\n            index15: A (in CLAUS)\n\n          So indeed A:3.\n\n      Now, what about other letters?\n\n      Combined needs:\n        S:1, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1.\n\n      Pile has:\n        S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, M:1, O:3 (because: MOROZ has two O's and then? There's an extra O? Let me check the pile: \n            ...MOROZ... -> M, O, R, O, Z -> two O's from MOROZ, and then the host part? Actually, the host part is DEDMOROZ, which already had two O's? \n            Wait, the host is DEDMOROZ: D E D M O R O Z -> two O's.\n\n        In the pile: \n            ...MOROZ... and then later? The entire pile is: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS.\n\n            Let me break it down:\n\n            S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S\n\n            O's: \n                M O R O Z -> two O's, and then in DED? No. In CLAUS? No. So O:2.\n\n        But wait, the pile has two O's? Then how did I count 3? I must have miscounted.\n\n        Actually, the pile: \n            S, A, N, T, A, M, O, R, O, Z, D, E, D, C, L, A, U, S.\n\n        O's: at index6 and index7? Actually, after M (index5) is O (index6), then R (index7), then O (index8). So two O's.\n\n        Then the O count matches.\n\n      Now, D: \n          Combined: host has 2 D's.\n          Pile: D appears twice: indices 10 and 11 (after Z, then D, E, D).\n\n      E: \n          Combined: host has 1 E.\n          Pile: one E (at index11 after the first D).\n\n      C: \n          Combined: guest has 1 C.\n          Pile: one C (at index12).\n\n      L: \n          Combined: guest has 1 L.\n          Pile: one L (at index13).\n\n      U: \n          Combined: guest has 1 U.\n          Pile: one U (at index16).\n\n      Everything matches.\n\n      Why did I think the pile had two S's? It does: first and last. But the combined only needs one S. \n\n      Wait, the combined has one S from the guest and none from the host. The guest has two S's? \n\n      Let me check the guest name: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n\n        S: first letter and then the last letter? \n        Actually, \"SANTACLAUS\": \n            S (1), A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S (last letter is S) -> so two S's.\n\n      Oh!

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile (third input line) can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name (first input line) and the host's name (second input line). The solution involves checking if the frequency of each letter in the pile matches the combined frequency of letters from both names.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Inputs**: Read three lines from standard input: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's and host's names into a single string.\n3. **Count Letters**: Use a counter to count the occurrences of each letter in the combined names and separately in the pile.\n4. **Compare Counts**: If the counts of all letters in the combined names exactly match the counts in the pile, output \"YES\"; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match of letters by leveraging the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, which simplifies frequency counting and comparison.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    s1 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    s2 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    s3 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    total_counter = Counter(s1 + s2)\n    pile_counter = Counter(s3)\n    \n    if total_counter == pile_counter:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Inputs**: The program reads three lines from standard input, each stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Combining Names**: The first two lines (guest's and host's names) are concatenated into a single string to form the combined names.\n3. **Counting Letters**: The `Counter` class is used to count the occurrences of each letter in the combined names and the pile separately.\n4. **Comparison**: The program checks if the letter counts from the combined names match those from the pile. If they match exactly, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\". This ensures that all letters required to form both names are present in the pile without any extra or missing letters. \n\nThis method efficiently verifies the solution by leveraging Python's built-in `Counter` for accurate and quick frequency comparisons.",
