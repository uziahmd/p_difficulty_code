    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering that removing one element might help us avoid either the minimum or the maximum (or both) of the entire array.\n\n Observation:\n The instability of the array is defined as max - min.\n After removing one element, the new array's instability will be (max of remaining) - (min of remaining).\n\n We note that the original array has a fixed set of numbers. Removing an element can change the min and/or max.\n\n There are two main cases to consider:\n 1. Removing an element that is the current minimum. Then the new min might be the next smallest value (if there was a duplicate) or remain the same if we remove one occurrence of the minimum and there are duplicates? Actually, if we remove one occurrence of the minimum, then the new min is the second smallest distinct value (unless we remove the only occurrence of the minimum). But note: the array may have duplicates.\n\n However, note: We are allowed to remove exactly one element.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let the original array be `a` (after sorting). Then:\n   Let m = min(a), M = max(a)\n\n Removing an element can lead to two possibilities for the new min and max:\n   - The new min could be the original min (if we didn't remove the only occurrence of the min) or higher (if we removed all occurrences of the min).\n   - Similarly, the new max could be the original max (if we didn't remove the only occurrence of the max) or lower.\n\n But note: We are only removing one element.\n\n Therefore, we can consider removing each candidate from the sorted array and compute the instability, but n can be up to 10^5 so we cannot try every removal.\n\n Insight:\n\n Consider that the final instability is determined by the remaining min and max. The remaining min is at least the original min (unless we remove the min) and similarly for the max.\n\n We can consider:\n\n Option 1: Remove the global minimum. Then the new min becomes the next smallest number (which is the first element in the sorted array if we remove the first, but note: there might be duplicates). However, we can think in terms of sorted array.\n\n Steps:\n\n  Sort the array: let b = sorted(a)\n\n  Then, the instability when removing an element at index i (0-indexed) is:\n\n    If we remove an element, then the new min = \n        if we remove the first element (i=0): then the new min is b[1] (if n>1)\n        else: the new min is b[0] (if we don't remove the first occurrence, but wait: what if there are duplicates? Actually, if we remove an element that is not the first occurrence, then the min remains the same until we remove all duplicates? \n\n  Alternatively, note that the remaining array's min is the minimum of the remaining elements. In the sorted array, if we remove an element, the min becomes the smallest element that is not removed.\n\n  Similarly, the max becomes the largest element that is not removed.\n\n  So, for a removal at index i, the remaining array's min is:\n      If i == 0, then the min becomes b[1] (if n==1 then not applicable, but n>=2) OR if there are duplicates of b[0], then even if we remove the first occurrence, the min remains b[0]. \n\n  Actually, we can do:\n\n      Let the remaining array's min = \n          If we remove an element that is the last occurrence of the minimum (i.e., the element is b[0] and it is the last one of the consecutive b[0]s) then the next min is the next distinct value? Not exactly: \n\n  Actually, we can break the array into two parts: left part (elements <= some value) and right part (elements >= some value). \n\n  We can precompute:\n\n      Let L[i] be the minimum value in the subarray from 0 to i-1 (if we remove the element at i, then the left part goes from 0 to i-1) and the right part from i+1 to n-1.\n\n  Then the min after removal is min(L[i], min_right) where min_right is the minimum of the right part (from i+1 to n-1). But note: we have the entire array sorted.\n\n  Alternatively, we can note:\n\n      The min of the remaining array is the minimum of the entire array except the removed one. Since the array is sorted, we can use:\n\n        If we remove an element at index i:\n\n          left_min = b[0] if there is any element to the left of i (i.e., if i > 0) then the min of the left part is b[0] (because the array is sorted). Actually, no: the left part is from 0 to i-1, so the min of",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in efficiently determining the potential new min and max after removing any element.\n2. **Edge Cases Handling**: If the array has only two elements, removing either will result in an array with a single element, making the instability zero.\n3. **General Case**: For arrays with more than two elements, the optimal solution involves considering the removal of elements that could potentially reduce the instability. Specifically, we look at removing elements that are either the minimum or the maximum in the original array, but not necessarily the global min or max if they appear multiple times.\n4. **Sliding Window Insight**: After sorting, the best instability achievable by removing an element can be found by considering windows that exclude one element from the sorted array. The key insight is that the instability of the resulting array (after removal) is determined by the difference between the new maximum and new minimum in the remaining elements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    a.sort()\n    ans = float('inf')\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        left_min = a[0] if i == 0 else a[i-1]\n        right_max = a[-1] if i == n-1 else a[i+1]\n        current_instability = right_max - left_min\n        if current_instability < ans:\n            ans = current_instability\n            \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of elements and the array itself.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the array has exactly two elements, removing any one results in a single-element array, hence the instability is zero.\n3. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to facilitate efficient calculation of min and max values after any removal.\n4. **Finding Minimum Instability**: For each element in the sorted array, we consider the scenario where that element is removed. The new min is the smallest element before the removed one (or the global min if the removed element wasn't the first occurrence), and the new max is the largest element after the removed one (or the global max if the removed element wasn't the last occurrence). The instability for each such scenario is calculated, and the minimum among all these instabilities is our answer.\n5. **Output**: The computed minimum instability is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem by leveraging sorting and a linear scan through the array, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
