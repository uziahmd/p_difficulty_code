Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university.

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem.\n\n We are given two points (home and university) and n lines (roads). The roads divide the plane into blocks. We can move from one block to another if they share a nonzero length border. This means we can only cross a road (i.e., step from one block to an adjacent one) when we cross a single road? Actually, note: the movement is defined by having a common border of nonzero length. But in the problem statement, we are allowed to move from one block to another if their common border is nonzero. In graph terms, we can think of each road as a separator between two sets of regions.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". This implies that two blocks must share a segment of a road (or multiple roads? Actually no, because if two blocks share a segment of a road, then they are separated by exactly one road at that segment). But wait: the roads are infinite lines. The common border between two adjacent blocks is a segment of one of the lines (because two different lines intersect and form several regions, and two adjacent regions share a part of one line).\n\n However, note: the problem says that we cannot move from one block to another if they are adjacent at an intersection but have no shared nonzero boundary segment. So we require a whole segment (not just a point) to be the common border.\n\n How do we model the problem?\n\n Observation: The entire plane is divided by n lines. The key is that we can cross one road at a time. But note: the problem does not require us to cross one road per step? Actually, when moving from one block to an adjacent block, we cross exactly one road. However, the problem states that we can move from one block to another if they share a nonzero border. This is equivalent to crossing one road.\n\n But here's the catch: if we are allowed to cross multiple roads in one step? Actually, no: because the common border is defined by one road. So each step crosses exactly one road.\n\n Therefore, the problem reduces to: how many distinct roads must we cross to go from home to university?\n\n However, wait: what if two consecutive crossings are on the same road? Actually, we don't care about the order because crossing the same road twice would bring us back. But note: we are counting steps and each step crosses one road (and we cannot cross the same road twice consecutively in the same direction? Actually, the problem doesn't specify that we cannot use the same road twice, but since we are looking for minimum steps, we don't want to cross the same road twice.\n\n But note: the movement is defined by crossing a road. Each step we cross one road. However, we might have to cross a road multiple times? Actually, the minimal path will not cross the same road twice. Because if we cross a road, then leave the new block and come back, we are effectively undoing the step, which is not minimal.\n\n However, there's a more fundamental issue: the problem says that we can move from one block to another if they share a nonzero border. So we can only move to an adjacent block (across one road). Then the entire problem becomes: how many roads must be crossed to go from the home block to the university block?\n\n But note: it is possible that the home and university are separated by k roads. Then we must cross k roads, and each crossing is one step. So the answer is k.\n\n However, consider: if two roads are parallel, then they don't intersect. But the home and university are separated by both? Then we must cross both. So the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the home from the university.\n\n But wait: what does \"separate\" mean? Actually, each road divides the plane into two half-planes. The home and university lie on opposite sides of a road if the road separates them. Then we must cross that road.\n\n Therefore, the idea is: for each road, check whether the home and university lie on opposite sides. If they do, then we must cross that road. And the total number of such roads is the number of steps.\n\n However, note: the example inputs:\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: \n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        2\n        0 1 0\n        1 0 0\n\n   Output: 2\n\n Explanation: \n        Home (1,1) and University (-1,-1)\n        Two roads: x=0 and y=0 (vertical and horizontal lines)\n\n        For the road x=0 (0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0? Actually, wait: the equation is given as ax+by+ci=0.\n        First road: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y=0? Actually, wait: the example input string is: \n            ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0']\n\n        Let me parse: \n          1 1 -> home\n          -1 -1 -> university\n          2 roads\n          Road1: a=0, b=1, c=0 -> 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y=0\n          Road2: a=1, b=0, c=0 -> 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0 -> x=0\n\n        Now, home (1,1): for Road1: 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 > 0; for Road2: 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1 > 0.\n        University (-1,-1): for Road1: 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 < 0; for Road2: 1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0 = -1 < 0.\n\n        So for Road1: home and university are on opposite sides? \n            Home: positive, University: negative -> opposite -> must cross.\n        Similarly, Road2: home positive, university negative -> opposite -> must cross.\n\n        So we must cross 2 roads -> 2 steps.\n\n Example 2:\n        Input: \n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            3\n            1 0 0\n            0 1 0\n            1 1 -3\n\n        Output: 2\n\n        Let's check:\n            Road1: x=0 -> 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0 -> x=0\n            Road2: y=0 -> 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y=0\n            Road3: x+y-3=0 -> x+y=3\n\n        Home (1,1): \n            Road1: 1>0 -> positive\n            Road2: 1>0 -> positive\n            Road3: 1+1-3=-1 -> negative\n\n        University (-1,-1):\n            Road1: -1<0 -> negative\n            Road2: -1<0 -> negative\n            Road3: -1-1-3=-5 -> negative\n\n        Now, for Road1: home positive, university negative -> opposite -> count\n        Road2: home positive, university negative -> opposite -> count\n        Road3: home negative, university negative -> same side -> no count\n\n        So we have 2 roads to cross -> output 2.\n\n Therefore, the solution is: for each road, compute the sign of the home and the university with respect to the road equation (ax+by+ci). If the signs are different, then we must cross this road. Then the answer is the total count.\n\n However, note: what if the road passes through the home or university? The problem states: \"It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\" So we don't have to worry about zero.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Read home (x1, y1)\n   Read university (x2, y2)\n   Read n\n   For i in range(n):\n        Read a, b, c\n\n        value_home = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        value_uni = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        Check if value_home * value_uni < 0 -> then they are on opposite sides.\n\n   Count the number of roads for which the above condition holds.\n\n   Print the count.\n\n But wait: what about the direction of the normal vector? The equation is ax+by+ci=0. The sign depends on the side we consider. However, note that if we flip the signs of a, b, c (i.e., multiply by -1) then the equation is the same, but the sign for the side flips. But note: the product value_home * value_uni will be the same regardless of the sign flip (since both values flip sign). So we are good.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the condition for being on opposite sides is that the product is negative. But note: if we flip the entire equation, then both values become negative of what they were, so the product remains positive? Wait, no: \n\n   Original: value_home = a*x1+b*y1+c, value_uni = a*x2+b*y2+c\n   Flip: value_flip_home = -a*x1 -b*y1 -c = -(value_home)\n   Similarly, value_flip_uni = -(value_uni)\n\n   Then the product becomes (-(value_home)) * (-(value_uni)) = value_home * value_uni, so same.\n\n   Alternatively, if we consider the equation multiplied by a negative constant, the signs of the two points remain consistent (both flip or both don't flip) so the relative sign (product) is invariant.\n\n Therefore, the method is correct.\n\n Let me test with example 1:\n\n   Road1: a=0, b=1, c=0 -> equation: y=0.\n        Home (1,1): 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive.\n        University (-1,-1): 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 -> negative.\n        Product: 1 * (-1) = -1 -> opposite -> count.\n\n   Road2: a=1, b=0, c=0 -> equation: x=0.\n        Home (1,1): 1*1+0+0=1 -> positive.\n        University (-1,-1): 1*(-1)= -1 -> negative.\n        Product: 1*(-1)=-1 -> opposite -> count.\n\n   Total count=2.\n\n Example 2:\n\n   Road1: a=1, b=0, c=0 -> x=0\n        Home: 1, University: -1 -> opposite.\n\n   Road2: a=0, b=1, c=0 -> y=0\n        Home: 1, University: -1 -> opposite.\n\n   Road3: a=1, b=1, c=-3 -> x+y-3=0\n        Home: 1+1-3=-1, University: -1-1-3=-5 -> both negative -> same side -> no.\n\n   Count=2.\n\n So we output 2.\n\n But wait: what if the road equation is defined with negative coefficients? For example, if we have the equation -x=0, then for home (1,1): -1+0+0 = -1, for university (-1,-1): -(-1)=1 -> product: -1*1=-1 -> opposite. Correct.\n\n However, note: the equation representation is arbitrary. The condition is independent of the scaling factor (as long as we don't change the sign, but note: we are using the product so if we multiply by a negative factor, the signs flip for both points, but the product remains positive? Wait, no: \n\n   Let me clarify: if we multiply the entire equation by -1, then the equation becomes -a*x -b*y -c = 0, which is the same line. Then the value for home becomes: -a*x1 -b*y1 -c = -(a*x1+b*y1+c). Similarly for university.\n\n   Then the product: [-(a*x1+b*y1+c)] * [-(a*x2+b*y2+c)] = (a*x1+b*y1+c)*(a*x2+b*y2+c) -> same as the original product.\n\n   So indeed, the product is invariant under multiplication by a positive scalar and also under negation (which is a special case of multiplying by a negative scalar, but note: the product is squared so the sign doesn't change? Actually, no: the product is the same as the original because two negatives multiplied together give a positive. \n\n   However, wait: if we multiply by a negative scalar, then the product of the two values (which was originally negative) becomes positive? That would break our condition.\n\n   But note: the condition is that the product is negative. However, if we multiply the equation by a negative scalar, then both values flip sign, so the product remains the same (because negative * negative = positive, but wait: no, actually if the original product was negative, then after flipping both signs, the product is positive? \n\n   Let me check:\n\n      Original: value1 = p, value2 = q, and p*q < 0 (negative product).\n      After flipping: value1' = -p, value2' = -q, then (value1')(value2') = (-p)(-q)= p*q (positive) -> then we would not count when we should.\n\n   But wait, that breaks the condition! \n\n   However, note: the equation is defined up to a scalar multiple. But the problem says: the equation is given as ax+by+ci=0, and the representation is arbitrary. We must account for the fact that the equation can be scaled arbitrarily (including negative scalars). \n\n   Therefore, we cannot rely solely on the product being negative. We need to know if the two points are on opposite sides of the line, regardless of the equation representation.\n\n   Alternative approach: for a given line, we can define a side by the sign of (a*x+b*y+c). But if we scale the equation by a negative, then the side flips. However, the condition for being on opposite sides is that the two expressions have opposite signs. But note: if we flip the equation, then the entire side information flips. But the relative sign (whether they are on the same side or not) is the same.\n\n   Actually, let me reframe: we want to know if the two points are separated by the line. The separation is independent of the equation representation.\n\n   We can define the function f(x,y) = a*x+b*y+c. Then the two points are on opposite sides if f(home) and f(university) have opposite signs.\n\n   However, if we use a different equation (like -a*x-b*y-c=0) then the function becomes g(x,y) = -f(x,y). Then g(home) = -f(home), g(university) = -f(university). Then the product g(home)*g(university) = f(home)*f(university). \n\n   But wait: if the original product was negative, then the product of the negatives is positive. Then we would get the same condition (opposite sides) as positive product? No, we would get positive product meaning same side? \n\n   Actually, no: the condition for opposite sides is that the two values have opposite signs. With the flipped equation, the signs are flipped. So if originally f(home) was positive and f(university) negative, then with the flipped equation we have g(home)=negative and g(university)=positive. Then the product is negative again, so we still say they are opposite.\n\n   But wait, the product is negative in both cases. \n\n   Let me do the math:\n\n      Original: f(home) = A, f(university) = B, and A*B < 0.\n\n      Flipped: g(home) = -A, g(university) = -B, then (-A)*(-B)=A*B. So the product is the same.\n\n   Therefore, the product is invariant under scaling by positive or negative constants? \n\n   Actually, no: if we multiply by a positive scalar, the product remains the same. If we multiply by a negative scalar, the product remains the same? \n\n   Let me check with a negative scalar: \n\n      Multiply by -1: then the equation becomes -a*x -b*y -c=0, and the function becomes h(x,y) = -a*x-b*y-c = -f(x,y).\n\n      Then h(home) = -f(home), h(university) = -f(university). Then h(home)*h(university) = (-f(home))*(-f(university)) = f(home)*f(university). \n\n   So regardless of the scalar (as long as it's nonzero) the product of the two function values is the same.\n\n   Therefore, we can use the product.\n\n   However, note: we must avoid zero. But the problem guarantees that the points are not on the road, so f(home) and f(university) are nonzero.\n\n   So the code is:\n\n        x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n        x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n        n = int(input())\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            data = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            a, b, c = data[0], data[1], data[2]\n\n            # Calculate the value for home and university\n            val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n            val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n            # If the product is negative, then opposite sides.\n            if val1 * val2 < 0:\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n But wait: what if the product overflows? The numbers can be up to 10^6, and the coordinates are up to 10^6, so a*x1 can be up to 10^12, and then adding three such terms (if all a,b,c are around 10^6) then the absolute value could be up to 3e12, which is within the range of Python integers (Python integers are arbitrary precision, but the product of two such numbers could be 9e24, which is also acceptable in Python for integers, but note: we are only doing one product per road and n<=300, so 300 such products is acceptable.\n\n However, the problem says that the coefficients and coordinates can be as low as -10^6 and as high as 10^6. The maximum absolute value for val1 and val2 would be |a*x1| <= 10^6 * 10^6 = 10^12, similarly for b*y1 and c. Then the sum is at most 3*10^12. The product of two such numbers is 9e24, which is a very large integer, but Python can handle it.\n\n But note: the problem constraints are for input numbers, but the product might be negative and we are only checking the sign. However, we are doing an exact integer product.\n\n However, there is a caveat: if the product is negative, then the signs are opposite. But note: the product of two integers is negative if one is positive and the other negative.\n\n But wait: what if the product is too big and we lose precision? Actually, Python integers are arbitrary precision, so no problem.\n\n But wait: the problem says that the points are not on the road, so we don't have to worry about zeros.\n\n However, there is one more issue: the equation representation. The equation is defined by (a, b, c) and we are using the exact same equation. But note: the equation might be given with a, b, c that are not normalized. But that doesn't matter because we are only concerned with the sign.\n\n Let me test with an equation that has negative coefficients and see if the product is negative when they are opposite.\n\n Example: home (0,0), university (0,1), and a road: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 (y=0). Then for home: 0, for university: 1. But wait, home is on the road? No, wait: the problem says the points are not on the road. So let me choose a road that separates (0,0) and (0,1): for example, the road y=0.5. Equation: 0*x + 1*y - 0.5 = 0. Then for (0,0): -0.5, for (0,1): 0.5. Then product = (-0.5)*0.5 = -0.25 -> negative -> opposite.\n\n But wait, the input says integers. So the coefficients, ai, bi, ci are integers. But the product is integer? Yes, because a, b, c, x, y are integers, so the entire expression is integer.\n\n Therefore, we are safe.\n\n However, note: the example input uses integers, so we are good.\n\n But wait: the example input provided in the problem is:\n\n   Input 1: \n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0']\n\n   Input 2:\n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n   And the outputs are 2 and 2.\n\n   Our program returns 2 for both.\n\n   Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n However, wait: is it always the case that the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points? \n\n   Consider: we can cross one road per step. Each step moves us from one block to an adjacent one. The entire set of roads that separate the two points must be crossed. Moreover, we cannot avoid crossing any of these roads. Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of separating roads.\n\n   Why? Because the two points are in two different regions. The roads that separate them are the ones that we must cross. And each crossing moves us from one region to another. The minimal path must cross every separating road at least once, and we can arrange the crossings so that we don't cross non-separating roads.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is simply the count.\n\n   However, note: what if two separating roads are crossed in a way that the order matters? Actually, the problem does not require a specific order. The minimal number of steps is the number of separating roads.\n\n   But wait: what if the home and university are separated by k roads, but the graph of regions is such that we must cross some roads twice? Actually, no: we are only interested in the minimal steps. The minimal path would cross each separating road exactly once and no other road. Therefore, the answer is k.\n\n   So we output k.\n\n   Let me test with an example from a known configuration.\n\n   Example: three roads forming a triangle (three lines forming a triangle, but wait: three lines in general position form 7 regions, and they divide the plane. The home and university might be separated by two roads. Then we output 2.\n\n   Example: two roads (the x-axis and y-axis). Then home (1,1) and university (-1,-1) are separated by two roads.\n\n   Example: two roads that are parallel. Then the two points are separated by two roads (if they are on opposite sides of both). Then we output 2.\n\n   Example: one road separating the two points: then output 1.\n\n   Example: no road separating the two points: output 0.\n\n   This matches the examples.\n\n   Therefore, the code is as below.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and we must be cautious. There might be edge cases.\n\n   Edge case: n=0 roads.\n\n        Then the entire plane is one block. Then we don't need to cross any road. So output 0.\n\n   Our code: reads n=0, then no roads, then count remains 0 -> output 0.\n\n   Another edge: one road, and the two points are on the same side -> output 0.\n\n   One road, and the two points are on opposite sides -> output 1.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Therefore, we write:\n\n        x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n        x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            data = input().split()\n            if not data:\n                continue\n            a, b, c = map(int, data)\n            val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n            val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n            if val1 * val2 < 0:\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n But wait: the input format: the third line is n, then n lines. The example input is given as a list of strings, but we are reading from stdin.\n\n   Let me run the provided example:\n\n        Example 1:\n            Input: \n                1 1\n                -1 -1\n                2\n                0 1 0\n                1 0 0\n\n            Our code: \n                x1,y1 = 1,1\n                x2,y2 = -1,-1\n                n=2\n                first road: a=0, b=1, c=0 -> val1=0*1+1*1+0=1, val2=0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0=-1 -> product=-1 -> count=1\n                second road: a=1, b=0, c=0 -> val1=1*1+0*1+0=1, val2=1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0=-1 -> product=-1 -> count=2\n                Output: 2\n\n        Example 2:\n            Input:\n                1 1\n                -1 -1\n                3\n                1 0 0\n                0 1 0\n                1 1 -3\n\n            Output: 2\n\n   It works.\n\n   However, note: the example input in the problem is given as a list of strings, but in the actual input we read from stdin.\n\n   We'll assume standard input.\n\n   But wait: the example input string is given as:\n\n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n   But in reality, we read from stdin.\n\n   We'll write the code as above.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", and the input format is as described.\n\n   Final code:\n\n   Read two points, then n, then n lines.\n\n   We are done.\n\n   But wait: what if the product is too large and we are concerned about performance? Since n<=300, and the multiplications are O(1) per road, and 300 is small, it's fine.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   Note: The input may have negative numbers, but our arithmetic handles that.\n\n   Code:\n\n        x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n        x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n        n = int(input())\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n            val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n            val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n            if val1 * val2 < 0:\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            2\n            0 1 0\n            1 0 0\n\n        Output: 2\n\n   Example 2:\n        Input:\n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            3\n            1 0 0\n            0 1 0\n            1 1 -3\n\n        Output: 2\n\n   It works.\n\n   However, wait: the example input in the problem statement is given as:\n\n        Input: \n            ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', ... ]\n\n   But note: the first line is two integers (x1,y1) and the second line is two integers (x2,y2). Then the third line is n, then n lines.\n\n   In our code, we read the two points with two separate inputs, then n, then n lines.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   But wait: the example input string is given as a list of two strings? Actually, the problem says:\n\n        The first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1.\n        The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2.\n        The third line contains an integer n.\n\n   So our reading is correct.\n\n   I think we are ready.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says \"neither your home nor the university is located on the road\", so we don't have to worry about zeros. But what if one of the values is zero? The problem guarantees they are not on the road, so we don't get zeros.\n\n   But note: the equation might be defined such that the value is zero for one of the points? No, because the point is not on the road. So the value for the home and university are nonzero.\n\n   Therefore, the product being zero is not possible. So we don't have to worry about division by zero or anything.\n\n   However, wait: the condition is the product being negative. But if one of the values is zero, then the product is zero. But the problem guarantees they are not on the road, so we never get zeros.\n\n   Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n   Let me run one more test: \n\n        Example: home (1,0), university (0,1), and one road: x+y=1 (a=1,b=1,c=-1)\n\n        For home (1,0): 1*1 + 1*0 -1 = 0 -> wait, that would be on the road. But the problem guarantees the points are not on the road. So we don't have to consider that.\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n        x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n        n = int(input())\n        count = 0\n        for _ in range(n):\n            a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n            val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n            val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n            if val1 * val2 < 0:\n                count += 1\n        print(count)\n\n   Submit.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the roads are defined by the equation aix+biy+ci=0, and the coefficients are integers. The home and university are integers, so the values val1 and val2 are integers.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, note: the equation might be defined with a negative leading coefficient, but that doesn't matter.\n\n   We are confident.\n\n   But wait: what if the product is positive and very large? We are only checking the sign, so no issue.\n\n   We output the code.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a single road (infinite line) that separates the two blocks. The key observation here is that each road that separates the home and university must be crossed exactly once in any minimal path. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining how many roads (infinite lines) separate the home and university blocks. Each road divides the plane into two half-planes. If the home and university lie on opposite sides of a road, then crossing that road is necessary to move from one block to the other.\n2. **Intuition**: For each road, we check whether the home and university lie on opposite sides by evaluating the sign of the linear equation (ax + by + c) for both points. If the signs differ, the road must be crossed.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves reading the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the equations of all roads. For each road, compute the value of the linear equation at both points. If the product of these values is negative, it indicates the points are on opposite sides of the road, and thus, the road must be crossed.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each road exactly once, performing constant-time arithmetic operations for each. With n roads (n ≤ 300), the time complexity is O(n), which is efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first two lines read the coordinates of the home and university. The third line reads the number of roads.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the coefficients (a, b, c) of the linear equation (ax + by + c = 0) are read.\n3. **Checking Sides**: The value of the linear equation is computed for both the home and university coordinates. If the product of these values is negative, the points lie on opposite sides of the road, and the road must be crossed (count incremented).\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of such roads gives the minimum number of steps required to reach the university from home, as each step corresponds to crossing one separating road.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road once, leveraging simple arithmetic and comparison operations to determine the solution, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
