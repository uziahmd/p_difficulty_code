Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are going to process the queries in reverse order because the later replacements might affect the earlier ones (e.g., if a digit is replaced by a string that contains digits to be replaced again). However, note that the problem says: \"the queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed\". \n\n But note: if we do the replacements from left to right, then replacing '2' with '00' and then '3' with '' in the example, we must consider that the second replacement (on '3') is applied after the first. However, the catch is that the same query might be applied multiple times (if a digit is replaced and then the resulting string has that digit again? Actually, the problem says: \"replace all digits di in string s with ti\". So the replacement is done for every occurrence of di at that time.\n\n However, the constraints say that the total length of ti for all queries is <= 10^5, and the initial string s has up to 10^5 characters, and n up to 10^5.\n\n Important: Doing the replacements in the given order naively (by scanning the string and replacing) would be too slow because each replacement might change the entire string and the next replacement would have to account for the changes.\n\n Instead, we can use dynamic programming or processing the queries backwards. The key observation:\n\n Since the queries are applied in the given order, we can think of building a transformation for each digit from the last query backwards. However, note that the problem does not require to output the string but the number modulo 10^9+7.\n\n Alternate idea: we can compute the final value of each digit in the original string by considering the sequence of transformations that apply to it.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We note that each query is of the form: digit d is replaced by string t.\n 2. We are going to process the queries from last to first, and for each digit (from '0' to '9') we will keep track of what transformation it ultimately becomes (a string) and also the multiplicative factor and additive constant that this transformation would cause when interpreting the entire string as a number? But note: the entire string is built by concatenation.\n\n However, we cannot build the entire string because the total length might be huge (each replacement may expand the string).\n\n Insight: we can represent the transformation for a digit as a function that maps an integer (the numeric value of the part that comes from this digit and the following digits) to the corresponding value in the final number. But wait, the problem is that the replacement of one digit may introduce multiple digits and these digits are subject to further transformations.\n\n But note: the operations are applied sequentially and the transformation for a digit d at the time of its replacement is defined by the current set of queries that have been applied so far? Actually, no: the queries are applied in the given order, so if we have two queries:\n\n   Query1: '2' -> '00'\n   Query2: '3' -> ''\n\n Then when we replace '2' with '00', the two zeros are not subject to Query2 (because Query2 is defined only for the digit '3'). However, if we had:\n\n   Query1: '2' -> '33'\n   Query2: '3' -> ''\n\n Then the first query replaces '2' by two '3's, and then the second query will remove those two '3's.\n\n Therefore, we need to process the queries backwards and for each digit, we want to know what it becomes after all the queries that come after it (i.e., the ones that are applied later) have been done.\n\n Let's define for each digit d (from '0' to '9') a transformation that converts a segment of the string that originally was a single occurrence of d into the final segment that results from applying all subsequent queries.\n\n However, note: the queries are applied from first to last, so the transformation for a digit d at an early stage must account for the fact that the string it is replaced by (which is ti) might contain digits that are subject to later queries.\n\n We can do:\n\n   Let f_d be the function (or the representation) that tells us, for a digit d, what is the final string that results from replacing d by t_i, then applying all the following queries.\n\n But we cannot store the entire string for each digit because the total length might be large. Instead, we can store the transformation as a way to compute the numeric value of the segment that this digit would contribute, and also the length of the segment (so we can adjust the powers of 10 for the entire number).\n\n However, the entire number is built by the concatenation of digits (each being transformed). We are to compute the number modulo 10^9+7.\n\n We can represent the transformation for a digit d by:\n\n   (value, length)\n\n where:\n   - value: the numeric value of the segment that the digit d becomes (as if it were the entire number, but actually we have to consider that the segment might be broken by the following digits)\n   - length: the length of the string that d becomes (in terms of digits)\n\n Then, when we have a string s, we can break it down by the digits and for each digit d, we know that it becomes a string of length L and represents the number V.\n\n But note: the entire number is the concatenation of these segments. If we have a segment with value V and length L, then when we put it together with the rest of the number (which is built from other digits), the entire number can be thought of as:\n\n   result = 0\n   for each digit d in the original string (from left to right):\n        result = (result * (10 ** L_d) + V_d) % mod\n\n However, the problem is that the transformations are sequential and the same digit might appear multiple times, and we have to consider the order of the queries.\n\n How to compute the transformation for each digit?\n\n We'll process the queries in reverse order (from last to first). For each digit, we start with an identity transformation:\n\n   Initially, for each digit d (from '0' to '9'):\n        value[d] = d (as an integer)\n        length[d] = 1\n\n Then, for each query (from last to first) of the form \"d->t\":\n\n   We update the transformation for the digit d.\n\n   Consider: if we have a query for digit d, then when we see a d, we are going to replace it by the string t.\n\n   But note: the string t itself is composed of digits. However, each digit in t might have been transformed by the subsequent queries (which we have already processed because we are going backwards).\n\n   Therefore, we can break t into its digits and for each digit c in t, we use the current transformation for c (which already accounts for all queries that come after the current one).\n\n   Then, the transformation for d is:\n\n        new_value = 0\n        new_length = len(t)\n\n        But how to compute the value?\n        Since the entire string t is transformed by the subsequent queries, we can compute the value of t as follows:\n\n        Let the transformed value of a digit c be represented by (val[c], len[c]). Then, for the string t, we can compute:\n\n            value = 0\n            for each character c in t:\n                value = (value * (10 ** len[c])) + val[c]\n\n        However, we cannot compute 10 ** len[c] directly if len[c] is large because the exponents might be huge (but note: the total length of all t's is <= 10^5, and we are doing at most 10^5 queries, but the length of t might be up to 10^5 per query? Actually, the constraint is that the sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 10^5. So the maximum length of a single t might be up to 10^5, but the total over queries is 10^5. But note: there are at most 10^5 queries, so the average length of t is very small.\n\n        However, we cannot precompute 10^(length) for each transformation because the length might be large (and we are working modulo 10^9+7).\n\n        Alternative: we can store the transformation for each digit as (value, length) and then combine them by:\n\n            value_combined = 0\n            for each char c in t:\n                value_combined = (value_combined * pow(10, len[c], mod)) + val[c]\n\n        But note: the exponentiation base 10 with exponents that are the lengths (which are at most 10^5? Actually, the length of a transformed string can grow, but note: we are only storing the length and the value modulo mod. However, the length can be very large (exponentially growing?) but note: we are representing the entire transformation for a digit. However, the problem says the total length of ti for all queries is 10^5, but the transformation might expand a digit to a long string (like repeatedly replacing digits). But note: we are processing backwards, and we are updating the transformation for the digit d. We must be cautious because the length can become very large. However, note that we are only storing the length and the value. The length is just an integer (we don't need to take modulo for the length because the exponentiation base 10 uses the length as exponent, but the exponent can be huge? Actually, we cannot compute 10^(some length) modulo 10^9+7 if the length is huge (like 10^9) because we can use Euler's theorem? But note: the modulus is 10^9+7, which is prime. And the exponent can be reduced modulo phi(10^9+7) if the base (10) and modulus are coprime. However, the problem does not specify the maximum length, but note: the transformation length is the total length of the string produced by the digit. Since the initial string is 10^5, and the total expansion is the sum of the lengths of the t's (but note: the expansion can be recursive). However, the constraint on the input says the total length of ti for all queries is 10^5, but the transformations can be applied recursively. This means that the length of the transformation for a digit can be very large (exceeding 10^5) and even beyond 10^9+7.\n\n        But note: we are only interested in the value modulo 10^9+7 and the length modulo something? Actually, the length is used as exponent in the modular exponentiation (for base 10). However, Euler's theorem tells us that:\n\n            10^k mod 1000000007 = 10^(k mod (1000000006)) mod 1000000007   [if k >= 0 and since 10 and 1000000007 are coprime]\n\n        But wait: the modulus for exponent reduction is phi(1000000007)=1000000006. However, the length k might be astronomically huge (exceeding 1000000006). We cannot store the entire length as an integer because it might be too big. However, note the problem: the initial string is 10^5, and the total length of ti for all queries is 10^5. But the expansion is recursive. However, the problem says the sum of the lengths of ti for all queries is <= 10^5, meaning that the raw input for the queries (the t strings) are short. But the expansion can be exponential? Actually, we are processing backwards and updating the transformations. The length for a digit d is the total length of the string that d becomes. We can update the length for d by:\n\n            new_length = sum_{c in t} (current_length[c])\n\n        Similarly, the value is computed by:\n\n            new_value = 0\n            for c in t:\n                # We need to shift by the length of the current transformation for c, then add the value for c.\n                # But note: the transformation for c is (val[c], len[c])\n                # The entire t is built by concatenating the transformed versions of each c.\n\n            new_value = 0\n            for c in t:\n                new_value = (new_value * (pow(10, current_length[c], mod))) % mod\n                new_value = (new_value + current_value[c]) % mod\n\n        However, the problem: the length of the transformation for c might be huge (so we cannot use pow(10, len[c], mod) if we store len[c] as an integer? Because if len[c] is huge (say, more than 10^9) then we can reduce the exponent modulo phi(mod) for base 10 and modulus mod? But note: we are storing the length as an integer. The length can be as large as 10^5 * (something) but the initial string is 10^5 and the expansion is limited by the total length of ti's (10^5) but the recursive expansion could be exponential? Actually, no: the constraint on the input is the sum of the lengths of ti for all queries is 10^5, but the same query might be applied multiple times and the expansion is defined by the entire set of queries.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the total length of ti for all queries is <= 10^5. This is the input. But during the transformation, the length of the string for a digit can be much larger. But the problem does not specify a bound on the intermediate lengths.\n\n        We must find a way to avoid storing huge integers for the length and value.\n\n        Alternative approach: we can store for each digit:\n\n            val[d] = the numeric value of the transformed string for d, modulo 10^9+7.\n            len[d] = the length of the transformed string for d, modulo (phi(10^9+7))? \n\n        But wait: the length is used only as an exponent for 10. Since 10 and 10^9+7 are coprime, we can reduce the exponent modulo (10^9+6) (Euler's totient of 10^9+7) because 10^9+7 is prime. Then:\n\n            10^k mod 10^9+7 = 10^(k mod (10^9+6)) mod 10^9+7\n\n        However, the length k might be huge, but we can store the length modulo 10^9+6. But note: the length is the total number of digits. The length is used in two ways:\n\n          1. To compute the value of a transformed string: we break the string into digits and then combine. But the combining requires knowing the length of each part.\n\n          2. The length is also the length of the entire transformed string.\n\n        But the problem: if the length is huge (like 10^100) then we cannot store it as an integer. However, we can store the length modulo 10^9+6 (for the purpose of exponentiation) and separately we need the actual length? Actually, no: the value computation requires the exact length? Not exactly: because we are breaking the string t into digits and then for each digit c we use the stored (val[c], len[c]) (with len[c] being the actual length of the transformed string for c). But wait, the transformation for c is independent and we are storing the length for c. However, the length for c might be huge and we are storing it modulo 10^9+6? Then when we compute:\n\n            new_value = (new_value * (10^(len[c]) mod mod)) + val[c]\n\n        But if we store len[c] modulo 10^9+6, then we can compute 10^(len[c]) mod mod correctly by using:\n\n            power = pow(10, len[c] % (mod-1), mod)   [because mod is prime, and 10 and mod are coprime]\n\n        However, note: Euler's theorem says: a^phi(mod) ≡ 1 mod mod. So yes, we can reduce the exponent modulo (mod-1) because mod is prime.\n\n        But wait: the length is the total number of digits. The value of the transformed string for d is computed by:\n\n            value = 0\n            for each char c in t:\n                value = (value * (10^(L[c])) + V[c]\n\n        Here, L[c] is the length (number of digits) of the transformed string for c. And we are storing L[c] as an integer. However, if L[c] is huge (like 10^100) then we cannot compute 10^(L[c]) directly.\n\n        But we can use modular exponentiation with exponent reduction by mod-1 (for modulus 10^9+7). So we can store the length of the transformation for each digit as:\n\n            L[d] = (the length of the transformed string for d) % (1000000006)   [because 10^9+7 is prime, so phi(10^9+7)=10^9+6]\n\n        Then, to compute 10^(L[d]) mod 1000000007, we do:\n\n            base = 10\n            exponent = L[d]   (which is stored modulo 10^9+6, but note: Euler's theorem requires exponent reduction modulo 10^9+6, so we can use exponent % (10^9+6))\n\n        However, the length we are storing is the total length (which is the sum of the lengths of the transformed digits in the replacement string). But note: the length is not necessarily the same as the length of the original t (because the transformation of each c in t expands it). We must store the length as an integer, but the integer might be too big. Alternatively, we can store the length modulo 10^9+6, because:\n\n            When combining two transformations (for two consecutive digits): \n                new_length = (L[c1] + L[c2] + ...)   (in terms of the entire string t)\n\n            But wait: the length is additive, and we are storing each L[c] modulo 10^9+6. Then the new_length is the sum of the individual lengths. However, the modulus for the exponentiation is 10^9+6, but the length is just a count of digits. The operation for the length is linear: if we have two parts of lengths L1 and L2, then the total length is L1+L2. So we can store the length modulo 10^9+6 (because the exponentiation base 10 uses the length as exponent, and we can reduce the exponent modulo 10^9+6). However, the length itself (the actual number of digits) is needed for the entire computation? \n\n        Actually, we have two things:\n\n          1. The value of the transformed digit d: we need to compute it modulo 10^9+7.\n          2. The length of the transformed digit d: we need it to compute the shifting (multiplication by 10^(length)) and also to combine the transformations (by adding the lengths of the parts).\n\n        But note: the length is used in two ways:\n\n          - In the value computation for a digit d: we use the length of the transformed string for each c in t to compute the shifting factor (base 10 raised to the length of the transformed c).\n\n          - In the combination of the entire string: the length of d is the sum of the lengths of the transformed c's.\n\n        However, the value computation for d requires the exact shifting factors (because we are combining the transformed digits). But if we store the length of each transformation modulo 10^9+6, then we can compute the shifting factor (10^(L[c]) mod 10^9+7) correctly. \n\n        But what about the length itself? The length is additive and we are storing the length modulo 10^9+6. Is that valid?\n\n        Example: \n            We have two digits: \n                d1: length L1, value V1\n                d2: length L2, value V2\n\n            Then the combined transformation for the string \"d1d2\" is:\n\n                value = V1 * (10^(L2)) + V2\n                length = L1 + L2\n\n            Now, if we store L1_mod = L1 % mod_exp, L2_mod = L2 % mod_exp, then:\n\n                new_length_mod = (L1_mod + L2_mod) % mod_exp\n\n            But is that the same as (L1+L2) % mod_exp? Yes.\n\n            Similarly, the value is computed as:\n\n                value = (V1 * (10^(L2)) + V2) % mod\n\n            And 10^(L2) is computed as pow(10, L2_mod, mod) [because by Euler, 10^(L2) mod mod = 10^(L2 mod mod_exp) mod mod, provided that 10 and mod are coprime (which they are)].\n\n        Therefore, we can store:\n\n            val[d] = the value of the transformed string for d, modulo 10^9+7.\n            len_mod[d] = the length of the transformed string for d, modulo 10^9+6.\n\n        Then, when processing a query \"d->t\":\n\n            new_val = 0\n            new_len_mod = 0   # but we are going to do: new_len_mod = (sum of len_mod for each c in t) % mod_exp\n\n            Actually, the length is additive, so:\n\n                new_len_mod = sum_{c in t} len_mod[c]   (then mod mod_exp)\n\n            But note: the length of the transformed string for d is the sum of the lengths of the transformed digits in t. However, the transformation for each c in t is already the final transformation (because we are processing backwards). \n\n            For the value:\n\n                new_val = 0\n                for c in t:\n                    # Shift the current value by the length (in exponent) of the transformation for c.\n                    # But note: the value of the transformed string for c is val[c] (which is the entire value of the transformed c), and the length is len_mod[c] (which we use to shift).\n\n                    # However, the shifting factor is 10^(len_mod[c]), because the transformation for c produces a string of length (original stored as len_mod[c] mod 10^9+6) and that is the exponent.\n\n                    # But wait: the transformation for c is stored as (val[c], len_mod[c]). The value val[c] is the entire number that the transformed c represents. However, if the transformed c is a multi-digit number, then when we concatenate with others, we must shift by the entire length (in digits) of that transformed c.\n\n                So:\n\n                    new_val = (new_val * pow(10, len_mod[c], mod)) % mod\n                    new_val = (new_val + val[c]) % mod\n\n            Then, we update:\n\n                val[d] = new_val\n                len_mod[d] = new_len_mod   (which is the sum of the len_mod for each c in t, modulo mod_exp)\n\n        However, note: the transformation for the digit d is being updated. But what if the same digit appears in the replacement string t? Then we are using the current (already updated) transformations for the digits in t.\n\n        But wait: we are processing the queries in reverse order (from last to first). This means that when we update a digit d, we are updating it so that it accounts for all the queries that occur after it (which we have already processed). Then, when we update an earlier query, the digits in t (which are other digits) have been updated to reflect the subsequent queries.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            mod = 1000000007\n            mod_exp = 1000000006   (since 10**mod_exp ≡ 1 mod mod, by Euler)\n\n            Initialize for each digit from '0' to '9':\n                val[d] = int(d)   (as integer, but then we will store modulo mod)\n                len_mod[d] = 1   (because one digit)\n\n            Then, read the queries and store them.\n\n            Then, process the queries in reverse order (from the last one to the first one):\n\n                Parse the query: \"d->t\", where d is a digit and t is a string.\n\n                Let d0 = d (the digit to be replaced)\n\n                Then, set:\n\n                    new_val = 0\n                    total_length = 0\n\n                    For each char c in t:\n                        # c is a digit (from '0' to '9')\n                        # Use the current val[c] and len_mod[c] (which account for all queries that came after the current one, because we are going backwards)\n                        new_val = (new_val * pow(10, len_mod[c], mod)) % mod\n                        new_val = (new_val + val[c]) % mod\n                        total_length = (total_length + len_mod[c]) % mod_exp\n\n                    Then, update:\n                        val[d0] = new_val\n                        len_mod[d0] = total_length % mod_exp\n\n            After processing all queries, we have the transformations for each digit.\n\n            Then, we process the initial string s:\n\n                result = 0\n                for each char c in s:\n                    # c is a digit\n                    # The transformation for c is (val[c], len_mod[c])\n                    result = (result * pow(10, len_mod[c], mod)) % mod\n                    result = (result + val[c]) % mod\n\n            Print result.\n\n        But note: what if a query has an empty string for t? Then the transformation for d becomes:\n\n            new_val = 0\n            total_length = 0\n\n            Then, we update: val[d] = 0, len_mod[d] = 0.\n\n        Example: the sample \"123123\\n1\\n2->00\"\n\n            Queries: n=1, query: \"2->00\"\n\n            Process backwards (only one query, so we update digit '2')\n\n            Initially:\n                val['0'] = 0, len_mod['0']=1\n                val['1'] = 1, len_mod['1']=1\n                val['2'] = 2, len_mod['2']=1\n                ... etc.\n\n            For query \"2->00\": \n                t = \"00\"\n                new_val = 0\n                for first '0': \n                    new_val = (0 * (10^1) + 0) = 0\n                    total_length += 1 -> 1\n                for second '0':\n                    new_val = (0 * (10^1) + 0) = 0\n                    total_length += 1 -> 2\n\n                So val['2'] = 0, len_mod['2'] = 2\n\n            Then, process the initial string s = \"123123\"\n\n            result = 0\n            for '1': result = (0 * (10^1) + 1) = 1\n            for '2': result = (1 * (10^2) + 0) = 100\n            for '3': result = (100 * (10^1) + 3) = 1003\n            then continue: 1003 * (10^1) + 1 = 10031, then 10031 * (10^2) + 0 = 1003100, then 1003100 * (10^1) + 3 = 10031003\n\n            This matches the example.\n\n        Another sample: \"123123\\n1\\n3->\"\n\n            Query: \"3->\" (empty string)\n\n            Update digit '3':\n\n                t = \"\"\n                new_val = 0, total_length = 0.\n\n                So val['3'] = 0, len_mod['3'] = 0.\n\n            Then, process s=\"123123\":\n\n                '1': 1\n                '2': 1 * 10^(len_mod['2']) + 2 = 1 * 10^1 + 2 = 12\n                '3': 12 * 10^(0) + 0 = 12\n                '1': 12 * 10^(1) + 1 = 121\n                '2': 121 * 10^(1) + 2 = 1212\n                '3': 1212 * 10^(0) + 0 = 1212\n\n            Which is correct.\n\n        Another sample: \"222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7\"\n\n            Two queries: \n                First: \"2->0\"\n                Second: \"0->7\"\n\n            We process backwards: first process the last query, then the first.\n\n            Initially: \n                For each digit d: val[d]=int(d), len_mod[d]=1.\n\n            Process last query (second): \"0->7\"\n                t = \"7\"\n                new_val = (0 * (10^1) + 7) % mod = 7\n                len_mod['0'] = 1\n\n            Then process first query (first): \"2->0\"\n                But note: the replacement string is \"0\", and we use the current transformation for '0' (which we just updated: val['0']=7, len_mod['0']=1).\n                t = \"0\"\n                new_val = (0 * (10^1) + 7) % mod = 7\n                len_mod['2'] = 1\n\n            Then, process the initial string s=\"222\"\n\n                result = 0\n                for each '2': \n                    result = (result * 10^(len_mod['2']) + val['2']) % mod\n\n                Each '2' contributes: \n                    Start: 0\n                    First '2': 0 * 10^1 + 7 = 7\n                    Second '2': 7 * 10^1 + 7 = 77\n                    Third '2': 77 * 10^1 + 7 = 777\n\n            Output 777.\n\n        The sample input \"1000000008\\n0\" (no queries) should output 1.\n\n            s = \"1000000008\"\n            Without queries, the transformation for each digit is the digit itself.\n\n            result = 0\n            for '1': 1\n            for '0': 1 * 10^1 + 0 = 10\n            then seven zeros: 100000000, then '0' again: 1000000000, then '0': 10000000000, then '0': 100000000000, then '8': 100000000000 * 10^1 + 8 = 1000000000008.\n\n            But wait, the expected output is 1.

The example says:\n\n                Input: \n                    ['1000000008\\n0']\n\n                Output: \n                    ['1']\n\n            This doesn't match our computation.\n\n            Let me re-read the example input format:\n\n                The first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.\n                The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.\n\n            So the input \"1000000008\\n0\" means:\n\n                s = \"1000000008\"\n                n = 0\n\n            Then the result should be the number 10000000008 mod 1000000007.\n\n            Let me compute: 10000000008 % 1000000007\n\n            We can compute: 10000000008 // 1000000007 = 10, remainder = 10000000008 - 10*1000000007 = 10000000008 - 10000000070 = negative? \n\n            Actually, 10 * 1000000007 = 10000000070, which is bigger than 10000000008, so:\n\n            We can do: 10000000008 % 1000000007 = 10000000008 - (floor(10000000008 / 1000000007)) * 1000000007.\n\n            Let me compute: 10000000008 // 1000000007 = 10 (because 10 * 1000000007 = 10000000070, which is greater than 10000000008, so floor division is 9)\n\n            Actually, 9 * 1000000007 = 9000000063\n            Then 10000000008 - 9000000063 = 999999945\n\n            But the example output is 1.\n\n            There seems to be a mistake.\n\n            Wait, the example input is:\n\n                ['1000000008\\n0']\n\n            And the example output is:\n\n                ['1']\n\n            This implies that the example input is:\n\n                First line: \"1000000008\"\n                Second line: 0\n\n            Then the number is 10000000008, and 10000000008 mod 1000000007 is 999999945, not 1.\n\n            But wait, the example input is provided as:\n\n                Input: \n                    ['1000000008\\n0']\n\n                Output: \n                    ['1']\n\n            This does not match.

Then the string is \"1000000008\", and the number is 10000000008.\n\n            But 10000000008 mod 1000000007 is 999999945, not 1.\n\n            Unless the example input is not \"1000000008\" but \"1\", and then the next line is \"0000000\", but that doesn't make sense.\n\n            Let me check the problem statement example:\n\n                Input:\n                    ['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a series of queries that transform a given string of digits by replacing each occurrence of a specific digit with another string of digits. The goal is to compute the final number represented by the transformed string modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). The challenge lies in efficiently handling the transformations, especially since each query can affect subsequent queries if the replacement strings contain digits that are themselves subject to transformation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves processing multiple queries where each query replaces all occurrences of a digit in the current string with a specified string. The key observation is that transformations should be applied in reverse order (from last to first) to ensure that each digit's transformation accounts for all subsequent transformations.\n2. **Insight**: For each digit, we maintain two values:\n   - `val[d]`: The numeric value of the transformed string for digit `d` modulo 1000000007.\n   - `len_mod[d]`: The length of the transformed string for digit `d` modulo 1000000006 (since 1000000007 is prime, Euler's theorem allows exponent reduction).\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - **Initialization**: Start with each digit `d` having `val[d] = d` and `len_mod[d] = 1`.\n   - **Processing Queries in Reverse**: For each query from last to first, update the digit's transformation by combining the transformations of each character in the replacement string. The new value is computed by shifting the current value by the length of each transformed character and adding the character's value. The new length is the sum of the lengths of the transformed characters.\n   - **Final Computation**: After processing all queries, compute the final number by iterating over each character in the original string, applying their respective transformations, and combining the results using modular arithmetic.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nmod = 1000000007\nmod_exp = 1000000006\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data: \n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    s = data[0].strip()\n    n_line = data[1].strip()\n    n = int(n_line) if n_line else 0\n    \n    queries = []\n    for i in range(2, 2+n):\n        line = data[i].strip()\n        if line:\n            parts = line.split('->')\n            if len(parts) == 2:\n                d = parts[0].strip()\n                t_str = parts[1].strip()\n                queries.append((d, t_str))\n    \n    val = {}\n    len_mod = {}\n    for digit in '0123456789':\n        val[digit] = int(digit) % mod\n        len_mod[digit] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(len(queries)-1, -1, -1):\n        d, t_str = queries[i]\n        total_val = 0\n        total_len = 0\n        for c in t_str:\n            if c in val:\n                total_val = (total_val * pow(10, len_mod[c], mod)) % mod\n                total_val = (total_val + val[c]) % mod\n                total_len = (total_len + len_mod[c]) % mod_exp\n        val[d] = total_val\n        len_mod[d] = total_len % mod_exp\n\n    result = 0\n    for char in s:\n        result = (result * pow(10, len_mod[char], mod) + val[char]) % mod\n        \n    print(result % mod)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The initial values for each digit (0-9) are set to their numeric value (`val`) and a length of 1 (`len_mod`).\n2. **Reverse Query Processing**: Each query is processed in reverse order. For each digit in the replacement string of a query, the current digit's transformation is updated by combining the transformations of the characters in the replacement string. This ensures that all subsequent transformations are accounted for.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: The value computation uses modular exponentiation to handle large numbers efficiently. The length is stored modulo 1000000006 (Euler's totient of 1000000007) to leverage Euler's theorem for efficient exponentiation.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The final result is computed by processing each character in the original string, applying their transformations, and combining the results using modular arithmetic to avoid overflow and ensure correctness.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the transformations and computes the result modulo 1000000007, even for large input sizes.",
