Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of used candles needed to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have 'a' candles. Each candle burns for 1 hour and then becomes a used candle.\n   - We can take 'b' used candles and convert them into one new candle (which can then be burned).\n\n How it works:\n   Let total_hours = 0\n   Let current_candles = a\n   Let leftover = 0\n\n However, we can simulate by burning as many candles as we have, and then converting the used ones.\n\n Alternatively, we can think:\n   total_hours += current_candles   (because we burn all current candles, and they become used)\n   Then, we can form new_candles = current_candles // b   (from the used ones)\n   And the leftover used candles is current_candles % b.\n\n But note: after burning, we have used all the current candles (so the used candles are exactly current_candles).\n Then we use some of these used candles to make new ones: \n   new_candles = current_candles // b\n   leftover_used = current_candles % b\n\n Then set current_candles = new_candles + leftover_used   (because we use some to make new candles, and the rest are leftovers)\n\n However, note that in the example: \n   Input: \"4 2\"\n   Step 1: current_candles = 4 -> burn 4 hours, then we have 4 used candles.\n        new_candles = 4 // 2 = 2, leftover_used = 0.\n        Now we have 2 new candles (which we can burn) and 0 leftover. So next state: 2 candles.\n\n   Step 2: burn 2 hours, then we have 2 used candles.\n        new_candles = 2 // 2 = 1, leftover_used = 0.\n        Now we have 1 new candle.\n\n   Step 3: burn 1 hour, then we have 1 used candle.\n        new_candles = 1 // 2 = 0, leftover_used = 1.\n\n   Total hours = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.\n\n But wait, in step 3 we don't get enough to make a new candle, so we stop.\n\n However, note: the problem says we act optimally. So we can also consider that we don't have to burn all the candles at once? \n Actually, the process is sequential: we burn one candle per hour, but we can choose which ones to light. However, the problem does not specify the order, but note:\n\n   We start with 'a' candles. We can burn them one by one, and then use the used ones to make more. \n\n But the above simulation is actually:\n\n   hours = 0\n   candles = a\n   while candles >= b or (candles < b and candles > 0):   # but wait, if we have less than b, we can still burn the remaining candles, but we cannot make a new one until we have at least b used.\n\n However, the above method accumulates the hours from the initial burn and then uses the leftovers to form new candles.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   hours = 0\n   current = a\n   while current > 0:\n        hours += current   # burn all current candles\n        # Now we have 'current' used candles\n        new_current = current // b   # because we use 'b' used candles to make one new candle\n        leftover = current % b\n        current = new_current + leftover\n\n   But wait, in the example: \n        Start: current=4, hours=4\n        Then: new_current = 4//2 = 2, leftover=0, so current=2\n        Then: hours becomes 4+2=6, then current=2 -> new_current=2//2=1, leftover=0, current=1\n        Then: hours becomes 6+1=7, then current=1 -> new_current=0, leftover=1 -> current=1 (then we break the loop condition because 1>0, but then we do the next iteration: we add 1 to hours (7+1=8) and then leftover=1, new_current=0 -> current=1 again -> infinite loop.\n\n So we must adjust: note that in the last step, when we have 1 candle, we burn it (adding 1 hour) and then we have 1 used candle, which is not enough to make a new one. So we should break after burning the last candle.\n\n But the above while loop condition is not breaking appropriately. We are adding the current candles (which we burn) and then updating current for the next cycle.\n\n Actually, the problem is that the last step: \n   We burn 1 candle (so we add 1 hour), and then we have 1 used candle. Then we update current to (1 // 2) + (1 % 2) = 0+1 = 1. Then we continue.\n\n We don't want to burn the same candle twice. The candle is burned and becomes used, and then we use the used ones to make new ones. But the candle that was just burned is now used, and we account for that.\n\n However, the problem is that we are burning the entire current set, including the new ones we made from the previous leftovers, and then we use all the used ones (including the ones from the current set) to make new candles.\n\n But note: the process is:\n\n   We have a set of candles (current). We burn them all (so we get current hours) and then we have current used candles.\n\n   Then we make new_candles = current // b, and leftover = current % b.\n\n   Then we set current to new_candles + leftover.\n\n This is correct. However, the issue is that the last candle we burn (the one that leaves us with 1 used candle) is then used to make a new candle only if we have at least b-1 used candles from before? Actually, no: we use all the used candles (the ones from the current set) to make new candles.\n\n But wait, the example: \n   After burning 1 candle (the last one) we have 1 used candle. Then we try to make new candles: 1//2=0, so we don't. Then we set current=0+1=1. Then we burn 1 again? That would be incorrect.\n\n Actually, we are burning the entire current set and then using the used ones from the entire set. So we don't break the burning process until we don't have any candles.\n\n However, the problem is that we are allowed to use the used candles from the entire burning set. But note: the candle that was just burned is now used, and we are accounting for it. Then we use the used candles to make new ones.\n\n The simulation should be:\n\n   hours = 0\n   candles = a\n   while candles > 0:\n        hours += candles\n        # Now we have 'candles' used candles\n        # How many new candles can we make?\n        new_candles = candles // b\n        leftover = candles % b\n        candles = new_candles + leftover   # we keep the leftover used candles\n\n   But wait, in the example: \n        candles=4 -> hours=4, new_candles=2, leftover=0 -> candles=2\n        candles=2 -> hours=6, new_candles=1, leftover=0 -> candles=1\n        candles=1 -> hours=7, new_candles=0, leftover=1 -> candles=1\n\n   Then we do another iteration: \n        candles=1 -> hours=8, new_candles=0, leftover=1 -> candles=1\n\n   This leads to an infinite loop.\n\n Why? Because we are burning the same candle again and again. But note: the candle we burn is replaced by a used candle. However, we cannot use the same candle twice. \n\n The key: the candle burning process is that each candle burns for one hour and then becomes used. Then we can use the used candles to make new ones. But the new ones are distinct from the original.\n\n However, the above simulation is correct in the accounting of the used candles. But the problem is that we are burning the entire set of candles (including the new ones) and then we use the used ones (which include the original and the new ones) to make more.\n\n But wait: the example says 7 hours. So why is the simulation giving 8?\n\n Let me reexamine:\n\n   Hour 1: burn one of the 4 -> becomes used (total used=1)\n   Hour 2: burn another -> used=2\n   Hour 3: burn another -> used=3\n   Hour 4: burn the last -> used=4\n\n   Now we have 4 used candles. We can make 4//2 = 2 new candles.\n\n   Then we burn the 2 new candles for 2 hours (so total 6 hours) and then we have 2 used candles.\n\n   Then we make 2//2=1 new candle.\n\n   Then we burn the 1 new candle for 1 hour (total 7 hours) and then we have 1 used candle.\n\n   Then we cannot make a new candle (since 1<2). So we stop.\n\n So the total hours is 7.\n\n In the simulation, the first iteration: \n        candles=4 -> hours=4 (burned 4 candles) -> then we make 2 new candles and set candles=2 (which is the 2 new candles plus 0 leftover from the 4 used candles? Actually, we used 4 used candles to make 2, so leftover=0).\n\n   Second iteration: \n        candles=2 -> hours=6 (burned 2 candles) -> then we make 1 new candle and set candles=1 (because 2 used candles: we used 2 to make 1, so leftover=0) -> wait, that doesn't match.\n\n Correction: When we burn 4 candles, we have 4 used candles. Then we use 4 used candles to make 2 new candles. Then we have 0 leftover used candles from that set. Then we set candles=2.\n\n Then we burn 2 candles: that's 2 more hours (total 6). Then we have 2 used candles. Then we use 2 used candles to make 1 new candle. Then we have 0 leftover. Then we set candles=1.\n\n Then we burn 1 candle: that's 1 hour (total 7). Then we have 1 used candle. Then we use 1 used candle -> 1//2=0, so we set candles=0+1=1.\n\n Then we burn 1 candle again? That would be 8 hours, but that is incorrect because we already burned that candle.\n\n The error: In the second iteration, after burning 2 candles, we have 2 used candles, and then we use those 2 used candles to make 1 new candle. Then we set the current candles to 1. Then in the third iteration, we burn that 1 candle (so we add 1 hour, making 7) and then we have 1 used candle, and then we set current_candles to 0+1=1. Then the fourth iteration: we burn the 1 candle again? But that candle was just made from the used one from the third iteration, and then we burn it, and then we have 1 used candle again.\n\n However, the problem is that we are allowed to use the same candle again? No, we are not. The candle we burn is consumed. \n\n Let me clarify the process:\n\n   We have 4 candles: burn them -> 4 hours, and then we have 4 used candles. Then we make 2 new candles from the 4 used ones.\n\n   Now, we have 2 new candles. We can burn these 2 -> 2 more hours (total 6). Then we have 2 used candles from these 2. Then we make 1 new candle from the 2 used ones.\n\n   Now, we have 1 new candle. We burn it -> 1 hour (total 7). Then we have 1 used candle. We cannot make a new candle (since 1 < 2). \n\n So the process stops.\n\n But in the simulation, after the second iteration (when we had 2 candles) we burned them and then updated to 1. Then we burned that 1 candle and then updated to 1 again. \n\n The problem: the simulation is burning the entire set of candles (which includes the new ones) and then using all the used ones (including the ones from the new ones) to make more. But note: the new ones were made from used ones, so they are distinct and we haven't burned them until we burn them.\n\n However, the simulation is correct in the accounting: the total hours is the sum of the candles we burn at each step. But the issue is that we are burning the same candle twice? \n\n Actually, no: the candles are being replaced by the recycling process. The candle that is burned is then turned into a used one, and then we use the used ones to make new ones. The new ones are then burned and become used again.\n\n The mistake is in the way we update the candles: \n\n   Step 1: burn a=4 -> hours=4, then we have 4 used candles. Then we make 2 new ones (so we have 2 candles to burn next). The 2 new ones are separate from the original 4.\n\n   Step 2: burn 2 -> hours=6, then we have 2 used candles (from the 2 new ones). Then we make 1 new one (using the 2 used ones). Then we have 1 candle.\n\n   Step 3: burn 1 -> hours=7, then we have 1 used candle. Then we make 0 new ones. Then we have 1 leftover.\n\n   Then we break because we don't have enough to make a new one? Actually, no: the condition in the while loop is candles>0, so we do one more iteration.\n\n   Step 4: burn 1 -> hours=8, then we have 1 used candle, then we make 0, and set candles=1.\n\n   This is incorrect because we shouldn't burn the candle we just made from the previous used candle twice.\n\n The problem: the simulation is burning the same candle (the one we made from the used candle) again. But wait, how did we get the candle in the fourth iteration? \n\n   After step 3: we have 1 used candle, so we set candles = (1//2) + (1%2) = 0+1=1.\n\n   Then we burn that 1 candle in step 4.\n\n But that candle is the one we made from the used candle of step 3? Actually, no: we didn't make a candle from the 1 used candle (because 1<2). So the 1 candle we have is the leftover from the previous set? \n\n Let me track:\n\n   Step 1: \n        candles = 4\n        hours = 4\n        new_candles = 4 // 2 = 2\n        leftover = 0\n        candles = 2\n\n   Step 2:\n        candles = 2\n        hours = 6\n        new_candles = 2 // 2 = 1\n        leftover = 0\n        candles = 1\n\n   Step 3:\n        candles = 1\n        hours = 7\n        new_candles = 1 // 2 = 0\n        leftover = 1\n        candles = 1\n\n   Step 4:\n        candles = 1\n        hours = 8\n        ... \n\n The issue is that the leftover is kept and then becomes part of the next set. But note: the leftover is the used candles that we couldn't use to make a full new candle. \n\n However, the candle we are burning in step 4 is the leftover from step 3. But we already burned the candle that produced that used candle? \n\n Actually, the process:\n\n   We start with 4 candles (new). We burn them (step 1) and get 4 used.\n\n   Then we use the 4 used to make 2 new.\n\n   Then we burn the 2 new (step 2) and get 2 used.\n\n   Then we use the 2 used to make 1 new.\n\n   Then we burn the 1 new (step 3) and get 1 used.\n\n   Now, we have 1 used candle. We don't make a new candle. Then we leave the 1 used candle.\n\n   Then we have no candles? But the problem says we can make a new candle from b used ones. So we don't have any candle to burn in the next hour.\n\n   However, the simulation in step 4 is burning the 1 used candle? But wait, the 1 used candle is not a candle we can burn unless we turn it into a candle? \n\n   The problem states: \"Vasily can make b went out candles into a new candle.\" \n\n   So we cannot burn a used candle without first turning it into a new one (if we have enough). \n\n   Therefore, the process is:\n\n     We have a set of candles (which are either originally new or made from used ones). We burn them all (each gives one hour) and then we get a set of used candles (the same number as the candles burned). Then we use the used candles to make new ones.\n\n   But note: the simulation does not distinguish between the type of candles. We are simply counting the total available candles (both new and recycled) and then burning them and then recycling the used ones.\n\n   The catch: the leftover used candles from the previous set are carried over. And we cannot burn a used candle unless we first recycle it (if we have at least b used candles, we can recycle some). But the simulation does not require burning the recycled candles separately.\n\n   However, the problem is that the simulation is burning the same candle twice: the one we got from recycling is being counted as a candle to burn, and then we are burning it and then we are left with a used one again.\n\n   But note: the candle we burn is always a new candle (whether originally new or made from used ones). The used candles are the ones that were burned.\n\n   So the simulation is correct in the accounting of the burning process: we burn all the candles we have (which are the new ones, regardless of origin) and then we use the total used candles (from all the burned ones) to make new ones.\n\n   Then why the example output is 7 and not 8?\n\n   The example says: \n        Input: \"4 2\" -> Output: \"7\"\n\n   So the simulation must not count the last burning of the leftover candle.\n\n   What's the difference? \n\n   In the example, after step 3 we have 1 used candle. Then we have no candles to burn (because we need b=2 to make a new one, and we have only 1). So we should not burn that 1 used candle.\n\n   But in the simulation, we are burning the 1 candle (from the leftover) because we set candles=1 and then we enter the while loop and burn them.\n\n   How do we fix this?\n\n   We must note: the candles we have are the ones that we can burn. The used candles that are not enough to make a new one are not burned (because we don't have a candle to burn). \n\n   But wait, the problem says: Vasily can make b went out candles into a new candle. This implies that he can use the used candles to make new ones, but he cannot burn a used candle without having converted it to a new one.\n\n   Therefore, the candles we have at any time are the ones that are \"new\", meaning they are ready to burn. The used candles are stored separately until we have enough to make a new one.\n\n   However, the problem does not explicitly state that we cannot burn a used candle without converting. But from the example, we see that we burn only the new candles.\n\n   So the process is:\n\n        We have two types: \n            - New candles (which we can burn)\n            - Used candles (which we cannot burn until we have at least b to convert)\n\n        Steps:\n\n            total_hours = 0\n            new = a\n            used = 0\n\n            while new > 0:\n                # Burn all new candles\n                total_hours += new\n                # The new candles become used\n                used += new\n                new = used // b   # we use the used candles to make new ones\n                used = used % b   # leftover used candles\n\n        But wait, let's test with \"4 2\":\n\n            new=4, used=0\n            Iteration1:\n                total_hours=4\n                used=4\n                new=4//2=2, used=4%2=0\n            Iteration2:\n                total_hours=6\n                used=2\n                new=2//2=1, used=2%2=0\n            Iteration3:\n                total_hours=7\n                used=1\n                new=1//2=0, used=1%2=1\n\n            Then we break because new=0.\n\n            This gives 7, which is correct.\n\n        Now test with \"6 3\":\n\n            new=6, used=0\n            Iteration1:\n                total_hours=6\n                used=6\n                new=6//3=2, used=6%3=0\n            Iteration2:\n                total_hours=8\n                used=2\n                new=2//3=0, used=2%3=2\n\n            Then break. So total_hours=8.\n\n        The example input \"6 3\" gives output 8.\n\n        So we can solve the problem with:\n\n            a, b = map(int, input().split())\n            total = 0\n            new = a\n            used = 0\n\n            while new > 0:\n                total += new\n                used += new\n                new = used // b\n                used = used % b\n\n            print(total)\n\n        But wait, what if we have multiple cycles and the used candles accumulate? \n\n        Example: a=10, b=5\n\n            Initial: new=10, used=0\n            Iteration1:\n                total=10\n                used=10\n                new=10//5=2, used=0\n            Iteration2:\n                total=12\n                used=2\n                new=2//5=0, used=2\n\n            So total=12.\n\n        Let's check manually:\n\n            Start with 10 candles -> burn 10 hours, then we have 10 used.\n            Make 10//5 = 2 new candles -> burn 2 hours (total 12) and then we have 2 used. Then we stop.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        However, note: in the example with a=4, b=2, the used variable is reset to 0 after the first cycle. Then in the next cycle, we add the new candles (2) to used, so used becomes 2.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        But note: the above code does not account for the fact that we might have leftover used candles from previous cycles. Actually, the while loop accumulates the used candles from the current new candles and then recycles them.\n\n        The key is: we are burning all new candles (so they become used) and then we use all the used candles (including the leftovers from previous cycles) to make new ones.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify that we can only use the used candles from the current burning set. But note: we are storing the used candles from the previous cycles. \n\n        Actually, we are: in the first cycle, we use the initial a candles and then we recycle them. Then in the next cycle, we use the recycled ones. \n\n        But wait, the above code does not carry over the used candles from the previous cycle? \n\n        Let me reexamine:\n\n            We start with:\n                new = a\n                used = 0\n\n            Then we burn the new ones and add them to used. Then we recycle the entire used (which is the sum of all burned candles so far) and then set new to the recycled amount and used to the remainder.\n\n        This is different from the previous simulation. In the previous simulation, we did:\n\n            candles = a\n            while candles>0:\n                hours += candles\n                new_candles = candles // b\n                leftover = candles % b\n                candles = new_candles + leftover\n\n        But now, we are separating new and used, and the used is the total burned candles. Then we use the entire used to make new ones.\n\n        Why is that? \n\n        The problem states: we can make b went out candles into a new candle. \n\n        This means that we can use any used candles (from any burning) to make new ones. \n\n        However, the initial simulation did not account for the fact that we might have leftover used candles from previous cycles. It only accounted for the current burning set. \n\n        But in the example of a=4, b=2:\n\n            First simulation (incorrect version):\n\n                candles=4 -> hours=4, then new_candles=2, leftover=0 -> candles=2\n                candles=2 -> hours=6, then new_candles=1, leftover=0 -> candles=1\n                candles=1 -> hours=7, then new_candles=0, leftover=1 -> candles=1\n                candles=1 -> hours=8, ...\n\n            This is incorrect.\n\n        Now, the corrected simulation (with two variables) is:\n\n            total=0\n            new=4, used=0\n            Iteration1:\n                total=4\n                used=4\n                new=4//2=2, used=4%2=0\n            Iteration2:\n                total=6\n                used=2\n                new=2//2=1, used=0\n            Iteration3:\n                total=7\n                used=1\n                new=1//2=0, used=1\n\n            Then we break because new=0.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But wait, in the second simulation we are accumulating the used candles from every burning. However, note that the problem says: \"Vasily can make b went out candles into a new candle\". This means that we can combine all the used candles we have (from any time) to make new ones. \n\n        However, the above simulation does not use the used candles from the previous cycle if we don't burn in consecutive cycles? \n\n        Let me explain the process with two separate cycles:\n\n            Cycle1: burn 4 -> 4 used. Then we make 2 new from the 4 used. Now we have 2 new candles and 0 used leftover.\n\n            Cycle2: burn 2 -> 2 used. Then we make 1 new from the 2 used. Now we have 1 new candle and 0 used leftover.\n\n            Cycle3: burn 1 -> 1 used. Then we make 0 new. Now we have 0 new and 1 used.\n\n        But the two-variable simulation does:\n\n            Cycle1: \n                new=4, used=0 -> burn 4, so total=4, then used becomes 4. Then we make 2 new from the 4 used (so new=2, used=0).\n\n            Cycle2:\n                new=2, used=0 -> burn 2, so total=6, then used=2. Then we make 1 new (used//b=1), so new=1, used=0.\n\n            Cycle3:\n                new=1, used=0 -> burn 1, so total=7, then used=1. Then we make 0 new (1//2=0), so new=0, used=1.\n\n        But wait, in the two-variable simulation, the used is set to 0 after each cycle? \n\n        Actually, no: \n\n            In the two-variable simulation, we do:\n\n                total += new\n                used += new\n                new = used // b\n                used = used % b\n\n            So after cycle1: \n                total=4\n                used=4\n                new=4//2=2, used=4%2=0\n\n            After cycle2:\n                total=6\n                used=2   [we added the new=2 from cycle2 to used? But note: we started cycle2 with used=0? Actually, no: we are storing the used from the previous cycle in the variable 'used'. \n\n            How did we get used=2 in cycle2? \n\n            We did: \n                used += new   (where new from cycle1 was 2)\n\n            But wait, in cycle1 we ended with used=0, and then in cycle2 we set new=2, then we do:\n\n                total += 2 -> total=6\n                used += 2 -> used=2\n\n            Then we set new = 2//2=1, and used=2%2=0.\n\n            Then cycle3: \n                total += 1 -> 7\n                used += 1 -> 1\n                new = 1//2=0, used=1%2=1\n\n            Then we break.\n\n        This is the same as the example.\n\n        However, note that the used variable is not being reset to 0 at the beginning of each cycle. It accumulates the used candles from all the new candles we burned so far.\n\n        But wait, in cycle2, the used variable was set to 0 from cycle1, then we add the new candles (which are 2) from cycle2 to used. \n\n        Actually, the two-variable simulation is:\n\n            We have two types: new and used, but the used is the total used candles we have accumulated (from all the new candles we burned so far). Then we use all the used candles to make new ones.\n\n        This is valid because the problem does not specify that we have to burn consecutively. We can store the used candles and then use them later.\n\n        Therefore, the solution is:\n\n            Read a and b.\n            Initialize:\n                total = 0\n                new = a\n                used = 0\n\n            While new > 0:\n                total += new\n                used += new\n                new = used // b\n                used = used % b\n\n            Print total.\n\n        Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \"4 2\" -> 7 (correct)\n        Example 2: \"6 3\" -> 8 (correct)\n\n        Another example: a=1, b=2 -> \n            new=1, used=0\n            total=1\n            used=1\n            new=1//2=0, used=1\n            Then break. So output=1.\n\n        Example: a=10, b=5 -> \n            new=10, used=0\n            total=10\n            used=10\n            new=10//5=2, used=0\n            Then: new=2, used=0 -> total=12, used=2, new=2//5=0, used=2 -> break. Output=12.\n\n        But wait, the manual calculation for a=10, b=5 was 12, which matches.\n\n        However, note: the problem says we can use the used candles from the entire stock. This simulation uses the entire stock of used candles (which is the sum of all the burned candles) to make new ones.\n\n        But the problem does not specify that we have to use the used candles immediately. We can store them and use them in the next cycle.\n\n        This simulation is correct.\n\n        But note: there is an alternative solution that uses a while loop on the total candles (without separating new and used) but the accounting is different. \n\n        We'll go with the two-variable solution.\n\n        Code:\n\n            data = input().split()\n            if not data:\n                # but the problem says there are two integers, so we assume there are.\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                a = int(data[0])\n                b = int(data[1])\n                total = 0\n                new = a\n                used = 0\n                while new > 0:\n                    total += new\n                    used += new\n                    new = used // b\n                    used = used % b\n                print(total)\n\n        However, note: the above code uses integer division and modulus.\n\n        Let me run the example a=1, b=2: \n            new=1, used=0 -> total=1, used=1, new=1//2=0, used=1%2=1 -> then while condition fails (new=0) -> output 1.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        We'll submit this.\n\n        But wait, there is a possibility of an infinite loop? \n\n        Consider: \n            a=1, b=2: \n                new=1 -> then new=0, so one iteration.\n\n            a=2, b=3:\n                new=2, used=0 -> total=2, used=2, new=0, used=2 -> break. Output=2.\n\n        Example: a=2, b=3 -> 2 hours, because we burn the 2 candles and then we have 2 used, which is less than 3 so we stop.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        Another example: a=3, b=2 -> \n            new=3, used=0 -> total=3, used=3, new=3//2=1, used=1\n            Then: new=1, used=1 -> total=4, used=1+1=2, new=2//2=1, used=0\n            Then: new=1, used=0 -> total=5, used=1, new=0, used=1 -> break.\n\n        So 5 hours.\n\n        Let me check manually:\n\n            Start: 3 candles -> burn 3 hours. Then we have 3 used. \n            Make 3//2 = 1 new candle (using 2 of the used) and we have 1 leftover used.\n\n            Now we have 1 new candle. Burn it -> 1 hour (total 4). Then we have 1 used (from the new one) plus the leftover 1 -> 2 used.\n\n            Then we make 2//2=1 new candle. Burn it -> 1 hour (total 5). Then we have 1 used, which is not enough.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the problem input is from stdin and output to stdout.\n\n        Final code:\n\n            a, b = map(int, input().split())\n            total = 0\n            new = a\n            used = 0\n            while new > 0:\n                total += new\n                used += new\n                new = used // b\n                used = used % b\n            print(total)\n\n        This is efficient since a and b are at most 1000, and the number of iterations is logarithmic (base b) of a.\n\n        We are good.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles, given that he starts with `a` candles and can convert `b` used candles into a new one. The solution involves simulating the process of burning candles and recycling the used ones until no more candles can be made.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the initial number of candles (`a`) and set the total hours to zero. Also, initialize a variable to keep track of the used candles.\n2. **Burning Candles**: In each iteration, burn all available candles (adding their count to the total hours). These burned candles become used candles.\n3. **Recycling Used Candles**: Convert the used candles into new ones wherever possible. Specifically, for every `b` used candles, create one new candle. The remaining used candles (if any) are stored for future use.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are new candles to burn. Once no new candles can be made (i.e., fewer than `b` used candles remain), the loop terminates, and the total hours are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process by leveraging integer division and modulus operations to handle the conversion of used candles into new ones, ensuring optimal usage of available resources.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    total = 0\n    new = a\n    used = 0\n    while new > 0:\n        total += new\n        used += new\n        new = used // b\n        used = used % b\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads two integers, `a` (initial candles) and `b` (number of used candles needed to make a new one).\n2. **Initialization**: `total` is initialized to zero to accumulate the total burning hours. `new` starts with `a`, representing the available candles to burn initially. `used` is initialized to zero, tracking the used candles.\n3. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs as long as there are new candles (`new > 0`). In each iteration:\n   - **Burning Candles**: The current `new` candles are burned, adding their count to `total`.\n   - **Updating Used Candles**: The burned candles are added to `used`.\n   - **Recycling**: The used candles are converted into new ones using `used // b` (integer division). The remainder (`used % b`) represents leftover used candles that cannot form a new candle.\n4. **Output**: After the loop ends, the total hours (`total`) is printed, which is the maximum time the room can be lit.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the problem by continuously recycling used candles into new ones, maximizing the total burning time through optimal resource utilization.",
