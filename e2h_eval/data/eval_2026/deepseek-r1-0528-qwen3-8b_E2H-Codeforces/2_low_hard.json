Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, and then n lines of n characters each.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. All the letters on both diagonals must be the same (but note: the center is shared by both diagonals).\n 2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must be the same letter and different from the diagonal letter.\n\n However, note that the example: \n   Input: 3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw -> Output: YES\n   But: \n        w s w\n        s w s\n        w s w\n\n Here, the diagonals are:\n   Diagonal1: [0][0] = 'w', [1][1]='w', [2][2]='w' -> all 'w'\n   Diagonal2: [0][2]='w', [1][1]='w', [2][0]='w' -> all 'w'\n\n And the rest are 's'. So condition 2: all non-diagonal are 's' and different from the diagonal 'w'.\n\n But note: what if the entire grid is the same letter? Then condition 1 requires that both diagonals are that letter, and condition 2 requires that the rest are the same but different. However, condition 2 says \"different\", so if the entire grid is the same letter, then the rest (non-diagonals) would be the same as the diagonal letter -> fails condition 2.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read n and the grid.\n 2. Check the two diagonals and determine the diagonal letter (d1) and ensure that all diagonal cells are d1.\n 3. Check that all non-diagonal cells are the same and that this letter (let's call it d2) is different from d1.\n\n However, note: the problem states that the diagonals must have the same letter (which we'll call, say, 'x') and the rest must be the same letter (call it 'o') and different from 'x'.\n\n But note: the two diagonals must have the same letter, but what if the two diagonals have two different letters? Then we immediately output \"NO\".\n\n Approach:\n\n Let grid be a list of strings.\n\n Step 1: Extract the two diagonals.\n\n Primary diagonal: [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n Secondary diagonal: [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n\n Check if all elements in primary diagonal are the same and all elements in secondary diagonal are the same.\n\n However, note: the center element is common to both diagonals. So the entire set of diagonal letters must be the same? Actually, the problem states: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". This means the primary diagonal is one letter and the secondary diagonal is the same letter? Or can they be two different letters?\n\n Let me read the problem again: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". It does not say the same letter for both, but the same letter respectively. However, the example uses the same letter for both diagonals. Also, the condition 2 requires that the rest are different from the letters on the diagonals. \n\n But note: the example input: \n     3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw -> YES.\n\n However, what if the two diagonals have different letters? Then condition 1 fails because the primary diagonal must be the same and the secondary diagonal must be the same, but there's no requirement that the two diagonals have the same letter? Actually, wait: the problem says \"all letters are the same\" for each diagonal. So the primary diagonal has one letter, and the secondary diagonal has another letter, but the two diagonals might have different letters. Then condition 1 is still satisfied? But then condition 2: the rest must be the same and different from the letters on the diagonals. \n\n However, the problem says: \"all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\" \n\n So if the two diagonals have two different letters, then the rest must be a third letter? Or the same letter that is different from both? The problem says \"different from the letters on the diagonals\", meaning different from every letter that appears on the diagonals. Since the diagonals have two different letters, the rest must be a letter that is not equal to either of them.\n\n But wait, let's see: the example does not specify that the diagonals must be the same letter. However, looking at the example outputs:\n\n Example 3: \n      3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe -> Output: NO\n\n In this case, the diagonals are:\n   Primary: ['x','p','e'] -> not all same -> condition 1 fails.\n\n So actually, condition 1 requires that each diagonal is uniform. Therefore, the primary diagonal must be one",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given grid of letters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters in the grid must be the same and different from those on the diagonals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the integer `n` (the size of the grid) and the grid itself.\n2. **Check Diagonals**: \n   - **Primary Diagonal**: Extract all elements where the row index equals the column index (i.e., `grid[i][i]` for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`).\n   - **Secondary Diagonal**: Extract all elements where the sum of the row and column indices equals `n-1` (i.e., `grid[i][n-1-i]` for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`).\n3. **Validate Diagonals**: Ensure all elements in both diagonals are the same. If they are not, the answer is \"NO\".\n4. **Check Non-Diagonal Elements**: Verify that all elements not on either diagonal are the same and different from the diagonal elements. If any element does not meet this condition, the answer is \"NO\".\n5. **Output Result**: If all conditions are satisfied, output \"YES\"; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = input().strip()\n        grid.append(line)\n    \n    diag1 = set()\n    diag2 = set()\n    for i in range(n):\n        diag1.add(grid[i][i])\n        diag2.add(grid[i][n-1-i])\n    \n    if len(diag1) != 1 or len(diag2) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    d1_letter = next(iter(diag1))\n    d2_letter = next(iter(diag2))\n    \n    non_diag_letters = set()\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n                continue\n            non_diag_letters.add(grid[i][j])\n            \n    if len(non_diag_letters) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    non_diag_letter = next(iter(non_diag_letters))\n    \n    if non_diag_letter == d1_letter or non_diag_letter == d2_letter:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the grid size `n` and the grid itself, storing it as a list of strings.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: It then checks the primary and secondary diagonals by collecting all elements into sets. If either set has more than one unique letter, the grid cannot form an \"X\", and the output is \"NO\".\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: For each element not on the diagonals, the code collects them into a set. If there are multiple unique letters here, the output is \"NO\". Additionally, if the non-diagonal letter matches any diagonal letter, the output is also \"NO\".\n4. **Result**: If all checks pass, the grid forms an \"X\", and the output is \"YES\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the conditions for forming the letter \"X\" by leveraging set operations to ensure uniformity across diagonals and non-diagonal elements.",
