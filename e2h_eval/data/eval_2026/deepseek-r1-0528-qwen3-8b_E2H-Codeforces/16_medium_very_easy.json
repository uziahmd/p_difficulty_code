Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\n We are given two points (home and university) and a set of n lines (roads). The roads divide the plane into blocks. We can move from one block to another if they share a common border of nonzero length.\n\n Observation: Each road is an infinite line. The movement condition is that two blocks must share a common segment (not just a point). This is equivalent to saying we can cross a road only by stepping into an adjacent block at the crossing of two or more roads? Actually, note that when you cross one road, you step from one block to an adjacent block. But the problem says: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". \n\n However, note: the common border is defined by the intersection of two roads? Actually, no: the common border between two blocks is a segment of one of the roads. But wait, the problem states that the roads divide the plane. Typically, the regions (blocks) are separated by segments of the lines. \n\n But note: the problem says that if two blocks are adjacent to one intersection (a point) but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then they cannot be moved in one step. \n\n So the key is: we can only move across an entire segment of a road? Actually, the problem does not specify that the entire road is the border. The borders are parts of the roads. \n\n Alternate view: The entire plane is divided by the n lines. The regions are the connected components of the complement of the union of all these lines.\n\n Now, how do we move from one region to another? We can cross a road only at one point? But the problem says we move from one block to another if they have a common border of nonzero length. That means we can cross the road along a segment (so we are allowed to cross at any point along the segment). However, note that the movement is from block to block, so we are crossing one road at a time? \n\n Actually, consider: \n   - When we are in a block, we are in one side of every road.\n   - To get to a different block, we must cross one or more roads.\n\n But note: the problem says that we can move in one step if the blocks share a common border of nonzero length. This common border is part of one road (because if two blocks share a border, then they are separated by a single road). Therefore, moving from one block to another requires crossing exactly one road? \n\n However, wait: what if two blocks share a border that is defined by multiple roads? Actually, the border between two adjacent blocks is always a segment of one road. Why? Because if two blocks are separated by two roads, then the common border would be the intersection of those two roads (a point), but the problem says that the common border must have nonzero length. \n\n Therefore, we can only cross one road at a time. Thus, each step corresponds to crossing one road.\n\n But then the problem becomes: how many distinct roads separate the home block from the university block? Because each crossing (step) must be of one road, and we can only cross one road per step.\n\n However, note: sometimes we might cross the same road twice? Actually, no, because once we cross a road, we are on the other side and we don't need to cross it again. Also, the roads are fixed and the home and university are in fixed sides.\n\n But wait: the problem does not require that we cross each road only once. However, the minimal steps would be the number of roads that separate the two points. However, note that if two points are separated by k roads, then we must cross each of these k roads at least once. However, we might cross a road that does not separate them? Actually, no. Because if we cross a road that does not separate the two points, then we are going from one side to the other, but both points are on the same side of that road. Then after crossing, we are still separated by the same set of roads (except that we changed the side for that road) but now we are even further away from the university? \n\n Actually, the minimal steps must be the number of roads that separate the two points. Because each road that separates the two points must be crossed an odd number of times (at least once). And we can arrange the crossings so that we cross each separating road exactly once and never cross a non-separating road.\n\n But wait: what defines a separating road? A road separates the two points if the two points lie on opposite sides of the road.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require to go directly from home to university without going through other blocks arbitrarily. But the roads are linear and the movement is allowed arbitrarily. The minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n Why? Because we must cross each separating road at least once, and we can cross only one road per step. Moreover, if we cross a non-separating road, then we end up in a block that is still separated by the same set of roads (but with one non-separating road crossed). Then we might have to cross that non-separating road again to get back, which would add extra steps.\n\n Therefore, the answer is the number of roads for which the two points (home and university) lie on opposite sides.\n\n How to check for a road (a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i = 0) whether two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) are on opposite sides?\n\n For a line: a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i = 0.\n We can evaluate:\n   d1 = a_i*x1 + b_i*y1 + c_i\n   d2 = a_i*x2 + b_i*y2 + c_i\n\n If d1 and d2 have opposite signs (one positive and the other negative) then the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n However, note: what if the line passes exactly through one of the points? The problem states: \"neither your home nor the university is located on the road\", so we don't have to worry about zero.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0\"\n   Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1)\n   Road1: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y=0. \n        d1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 (positive)\n        d2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1 (negative) -> opposite.\n\n   Road2: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0 -> x=0.\n        d1 = 1*1 + 0 + 0 = 1 (positive)\n        d2 = 1*(-1) + 0 + 0 = -1 (negative) -> opposite.\n\n   So there are 2 roads that separate the two points. Output is 2.\n\n Another example:\n   Input: \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3\"\n\n   Let's check:\n   Road1: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0 -> x=0.\n        (1,1): 1 -> positive; (-1,-1): -1 -> negative -> separates.\n\n   Road2: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y=0.\n        (1,1): 1 -> positive; (-1,-1): -1 -> negative -> separates.\n\n   Road3: 1*x + 1*y - 3 = 0.\n        (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 -> negative; (-1,-1): -1-1-3 = -5 -> negative -> same side.\n\n   So two roads separate -> output 2.\n\n Therefore, the solution is to count the number of roads for which the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n But wait: what if the road equation is normalized differently? Note that the sign of the equation: if we multiply the entire equation by -1, then the signs of d1 and d2 flip, but the condition (opposite signs) remains the same. So we are safe.\n\n However, note: the equation is a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i = 0. We are using the same equation as given.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Read home (x1, y1)\n   Read university (x2, y2)\n   Read n\n   For i in range(n):\n        Read a_i, b_i, c_i\n        d1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i\n        d2 = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i\n\n        If (d1 < 0 and d2 > 0) or (d1 > 0 and d2 < 0):\n            Then this road separates the two points.\n\n   Count the number of such roads.\n\n However, note: we must avoid floating point inaccuracies because the numbers can be up to 10^6 and we are multiplying. But the problem says integers, so we can use integer arithmetic.\n\n But wait: what if the road is defined with large coefficients and the points are large too? The product might be very large, but within the range of Python integers (which are arbitrary precision) so that's okay.\n\n However, we must consider: the condition for opposite sides is that d1*d2 < 0, but we have to be cautious with zeros? The problem states that the points are not on the road, so d1 and d2 are not zero. So we can use:\n\n        if d1 * d2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n But note: the multiplication might be very large (like 10^12) but that is acceptable in Python.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid the multiplication by checking signs separately. But the multiplication is straightforward.\n\n However, let's test with the example:\n\n   Example 1: \n        Road: [0,1,0] -> equation: y=0\n        Home: (1,1): d1 = 1 -> positive.\n        University: (-1,-1): d2 = -1 -> negative.\n        d1*d2 = -1 -> negative -> opposite.\n\n   Example 2: \n        Road: [1,0,0] -> equation: x=0\n        Home: (1,1): d1=1 -> positive.\n        University: (-1,-1): d2=-1 -> negative.\n        d1*d2=-1 -> negative.\n\n   Example 3: \n        Road: [1,1,-3] -> equation: x+y-3=0\n        Home: (1,1): 1+1-3=-1 -> negative.\n        University: (-1,-1): -1-1-3=-5 -> negative.\n        d1*d2 = (-1)*(-5)=5 -> positive -> same side.\n\n So the code:\n\n   count = 0\n   for each road:\n        a, b, c = map(int, line.split())\n        d1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        d2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if d1 * d2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n But wait: the example input has two examples. The first example:\n\n        Input: \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0\"\n\n        We read: \n          x1=1, y1=1\n          x2=-1, y2=-1\n          n=2\n          Road1: [0,1,0] -> d1 = 0*1+1*1+0 = 1, d2 = 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 -> 1*(-1)=-1 <0 -> count=1\n          Road2: [1,0,0] -> d1 = 1*1+0*1+0=1, d2=1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0=-1 -> 1*(-1)=-1<0 -> count=2\n\n        Output: 2\n\n   Second example:\n\n        Input: \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3\"\n\n        n=3\n        Road1: [1,0,0] -> count becomes 1 (as above)\n        Road2: [0,1,0] -> count becomes 2 (as above)\n        Road3: [1,1,-3] -> d1=-1, d2=-5 -> (-1)*(-5)=5>0 -> not counted.\n\n        Output: 2\n\n So the answer is the count.\n\n However, wait: what if the road equation is given in a different form? For example, if the equation is given as -x=0, then a=-1, b=0, c=0. Then for home (1,1): d1 = -1*1 +0+0 = -1, for university (-1,-1): d2=-1*(-1)+0+0=1. Then d1*d2 = -1 * 1 = -1 -> opposite. So that's the same.\n\n But note: the problem says \"each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero.\" and the input gives integers. So the equation is as given.\n\n However, what if the equation is defined with negative c? It doesn't matter because we are only concerned with the sign of the expression.\n\n Therefore, the program is:\n\n   Read the two points.\n   Read n.\n   For i in range(n):\n        Read a, b, c\n        d1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        d2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if d1 * d2 < 0:\n            count++\n\n   Print count.\n\n But wait: is that really the minimum steps?\n\n Explanation: Each road that separates the two points must be crossed. And we can cross one road per step. Moreover, we don't need to cross a road more than once. Therefore, the minimal steps is the number of separating roads.\n\n However, consider: what if we cross two roads at the same time? Actually, no, because when we cross a road, we step from one block to an adjacent one. But note: when you cross two roads at an intersection, you are effectively crossing two roads at the same time? \n\n But the problem states: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". The common border is a segment of a single road. Therefore, you cannot cross two roads in one step. \n\n Therefore, each step crosses exactly one road.\n\n Hence, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n However, let me think of an alternative: sometimes we might have to cross a road that does not separate the two points to get around? \n\n But note: the two points are fixed. The entire plane is divided by the n lines. The minimal path (in terms of crossings) must cross each separating road at least once. And we can design a route that crosses each separating road exactly once (by going from one side to the other without crossing non-separating roads unnecessarily). \n\n Therefore, the answer is indeed the count.\n\n But wait: what if the two points are already in the same block? Then we don't need to cross any road. However, the problem says neither home nor university is on a road, and we are counting the roads that separate. If they are in the same block, then for every road they are on the same side. Then the count is 0, and we output 0.\n\n Example: \n     Points: (0,0) and (0,1) and one road: x=0 (equation: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0)\n        For (0,0): 1*0+0+0=0 -> wait, but the problem says the points are not on the road. So we must have non-zero for both? Actually, the input guarantees that the points are not on the road.\n\n     So if we have two points on the same side of every road, then we don't need to cross any road.\n\n Example: \n     Input: \n         0 1\n         0 2\n         1\n         0 1 0   # meaning the road is y=0 (but wait, the equation is 0*x+1*y+0=0 -> y=0)\n     Point1: (0,1): d1 = 0*0+1*1+0 = 1\n     Point2: (0,2): d2 = 0*0+1*2+0 = 2 -> same sign -> same side. So output 0.\n\n However, wait: the two points are in the same block? Actually, the road y=0 divides the plane into two half-planes. The points (0,1) and (0,2) are both above the x-axis, so they are in the same block. Therefore, 0 steps.\n\n This matches.\n\n Therefore, the solution is simply to count the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n But note: the problem statement says that the roads divide the plane into connected regions, and we are guaranteed that the points are not on the road.\n\n However, one more thing: the equation representation. The problem says \"ai and bi are not both zero\", and the equation is a_i*x+b_i*y+c_i=0. This is the standard form. Our method works.\n\n Code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input().strip())\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        data = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a, b, c = data\n        d1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        d2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        # Since the points are not on the road, d1 and d2 are not zero.\n        if d1 * d2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n However, wait: what if the multiplication of two large integers overflows? In Python, integers are arbitrary precision, so no overflow. But the problem constraints are up to 10^6 for coordinates and coefficients, so the maximum absolute value of d1 and d2 can be as large as |a_i*x1| <= 10^6 * 10^6 = 1e12, and similarly for others. The product is then 1e24, which is still manageable in Python (though in some languages it might be an issue). But the problem says the input integers are in the range [-10^6,10^6], so the product is at most (10^6 * 10^6) * 2 (if we consider the worst-case two terms) but actually, the entire expression is a*x1 + b*y1 + c, so the absolute value is bounded by |a|*|x1| + |b|*|y1| + |c|. Since each term is at most 10^6 * 10^6 (which is 1e12) and there are three terms, the absolute value is at most 3e12, which is an integer that Python can handle.\n\n But note: we are multiplying two such numbers (each up to 3e12) so the product is up to 9e24, which is still an integer that Python can handle (Python integers are arbitrary precision, but the operation may be slow for very big numbers, but 9e24 is not that big).\n\n However, we can avoid the multiplication by comparing the signs:\n\n   if (d1 < 0 and d2 > 0) or (d1 > 0 and d2 < 0):\n        count += 1\n\n This avoids the large multiplication (but actually the multiplication is of two integers, and the absolute values are large but the sign comparison is done without the full product).\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   if (d1 < 0) ^ (d2 < 0):   # but note: d1 and d2 are non-zero, so we can compare signs.\n\n However, the condition (d1 < 0) and (d2 > 0) is equivalent to (d1 < 0 and d2 != 0) and (d2 > 0). But we know d2 is not zero. Similarly, we can check:\n\n   if (d1 < 0) != (d2 < 0):\n\n But note: what if d1 is negative and d2 is positive, then (d1 < 0) is True and (d2 < 0) is False -> True != False -> True.\n   Similarly, if d1 is positive and d2 is negative, then (d1 < 0) is False and (d2 < 0) is True -> False != True -> True.\n\n And if both positive or both negative, then the condition is False.\n\n However, we must be cautious: d1 and d2 are not zero. So:\n\n   if (d1 < 0) != (d2 < 0):\n        count += 1\n\n This is equivalent to d1*d2 < 0? \n\n   Case 1: d1 negative, d2 positive: product negative -> condition true.\n   Case 2: d1 positive, d2 negative: product negative -> condition true.\n   Case 3: d1 negative, d2 negative: product positive -> condition false.\n   Case 4: d1 positive, d2 positive: product positive -> condition false.\n\n So yes, it is the same.\n\n But note: the problem says the points are not on the road, so d1 and d2 are not zero. So we can use:\n\n   if (d1 < 0) != (d2 < 0):\n\n This avoids the multiplication and is slightly faster.\n\n Let me change to this for clarity and to avoid large integer multiplication (though it's negligible, but why not).\n\n Code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input().strip())\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        d1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        d2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        # Since d1 and d2 are non-zero, we can check the signs.\n        if (d1 < 0) != (d2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n Let me test with the examples:\n\n   Example 1: Road1 (0,1,0) for (1,1) and (-1,-1):\n        d1 = 1 -> positive (False for <0)\n        d2 = -1 -> negative (True for <0)\n        Condition: (False) != (True) -> True -> count++.\n\n   Example 2: Road2 (1,0,0) for (1,1) and (-1,-1):\n        d1 = 1 -> positive -> False\n        d2 = -1 -> negative -> True\n        Condition: True.\n\n   Example 3: Road (1,1,-3) for (1,1) and (-1,-1):\n        d1 = 1+1-3 = -1 -> negative -> True\n        d2 = -1-1-3 = -5 -> negative -> True\n        Condition: (True) != (True) -> False.\n\n   Correct.\n\n However, note: what if the road equation is defined with a negative leading coefficient? \n\n   Example: Road: [-1,0,0] for the line x=0.\n        For (1,1): d1 = -1*1 +0+0 = -1 -> negative -> True.\n        For (-1,-1): d2 = -1*(-1) +0+0 = 1 -> positive -> False.\n        Condition: (True) != (False) -> True.\n\n   Which is correct.\n\n Therefore, the code is as follows.\n\n But wait: the problem statement says the roads are given as \"aix + biy + ci = 0\", so the equation is as given. The sign of the entire equation is arbitrary, but the condition (d1 and d2 having opposite signs) is independent of the scaling (as long as we use the same equation). \n\n We are consistent because we are using the same equation for both points.\n\n So we are good.\n\n Let me run the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            2\n            0 1 0\n            1 0 0\n\n        Output: 2\n\n   Example 2:\n        Input:\n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            3\n            1 0 0\n            0 1 0\n            1 1 -3\n\n        Output: 2\n\n   Example 3: \n        Input: \n            0 1\n            0 2\n            1\n            0 1 0\n\n        Output: 0\n\n   Example 4: \n        Input: \n            0 0\n            1 1\n            1\n            1 1 0   # the line x+y=0\n\n        d1 = 1*0+1*0+0 = 0 -> wait, but the problem says the points are not on the road. So this input is invalid according to the problem. But the problem states: \"It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\"\n\n        So we don't have to handle this.\n\n   Example 5: \n        Input: \n            1 0\n            0 1\n            1\n            1 -1 0   # the line x-y=0\n\n        d1 = 1*1 -1*0 +0 = 1 -> positive\n        d2 = 1*0 -1*1 +0 = -1 -> negative\n        Condition: (False) != (True) -> True -> output 1.\n\n   Example 5: the two points (1,0) and (0,1) are separated by the line x-y=0. Indeed, (1,0) is above the line (since 1-0=1>0) and (0,1) is below (0-1=-1<0). So we must cross the road to get from (1,0) to (0,1). Therefore, 1 step.\n\n   This matches.\n\n Therefore, we output the code.\n\n However, note: the problem says the roads are given as n lines. We assume the input format is as described.\n\n Let me write the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a single road (line) that separates the two blocks. The key observation is that each road separating the home and university must be crossed exactly once, and the minimal steps correspond to the number of such roads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves checking how many roads (infinite lines) separate the home and university blocks. Each road is defined by the equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\). The home and university are located in blocks (connected regions) not on any road.\n2. **Key Insight**: Two points lie on opposite sides of a road if the evaluation of the road's equation at these points yields results of opposite signs. Thus, for each road, we check if the home and university points are on opposite sides.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, compute the value of the equation at both points. If the signs of these values differ, the road separates the two points, and it must be crossed once. The total number of such roads gives the minimal steps required.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the \\(n\\) roads once, performing constant-time operations for each. Hence, the time complexity is \\(O(n)\\), which is efficient given the constraint \\(n \\leq 300\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    x1 = int(data[idx])\n    y1 = int(data[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    x2 = int(data[idx])\n    y2 = int(data[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    n = int(data[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[idx])\n        b = int(data[idx+1])\n        c = int(data[idx+2])\n        idx += 3\n        d1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        d2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if (d1 < 0) != (d2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first two values are the coordinates of the home, followed by the university's coordinates, and then the number of roads.\n2. **Processing Roads**: For each road, the coefficients \\(a_i\\), \\(b_i\\), and \\(c_i\\) are extracted. The equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) is evaluated at both the home and university coordinates.\n3. **Sign Check**: If the evaluations of the road's equation at the two points have opposite signs, the road separates them, and the step count is incremented.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of such roads is printed, representing the minimal steps needed to move from the home to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road once, leveraging simple arithmetic and comparison operations to determine the solution. The algorithm is optimal and handles all edge cases as specified in the problem constraints.",
