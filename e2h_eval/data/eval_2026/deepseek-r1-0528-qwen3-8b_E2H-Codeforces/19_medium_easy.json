The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a tree (n nodes, n-1 edges) and we need to remove k districts such that the remaining districts form a connected subgraph (so the entire remaining set must be connected by the original roads, but note: the removed districts' roads are blocked) and we wish to maximize the total number of fans.\n\n The fan value for district i is 2^i. Note: the base is 2 raised to the power of the district number.\n\n Since 2^i grows exponentially, we would prefer to keep higher-numbered districts and remove lower-numbered ones if possible? But note: we have to keep the graph connected.\n\n However, note that the condition is that the remaining contestants must be from districts that can reach one another. This means the remaining districts must form a connected subgraph. We are allowed to remove k districts, so we leave n-k districts.\n\n We wish to maximize the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts.\n\n Observation:\n Since 2^i is an exponentially increasing function, we want to include as many high-value districts as possible. However, we must maintain connectivity.\n\n How do we think about connectivity in a tree? Removing some nodes breaks the tree into multiple connected components. We require that the remaining set is connected. Therefore, we cannot remove a node that is a \"bridge\" for connectivity unless we compensate by having other connections? Actually, note that the problem says: the president removes k districts, and then the remaining districts must be reachable from each other (meaning the entire set of remaining districts forms a connected component in the original tree).\n\n But note: the removal of a node also removes its incident edges. So we are left with a forest. We require that the remaining nodes form a single connected component.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We know that in a tree, a connected set of nodes must contain at least one spanning tree. However, we are not required to use the minimal set, but to maximize the sum.\n\n Since 2^i is so large, we would prefer to keep the largest (highest index) nodes. However, we must ensure that the set is connected.\n\n We can consider: what is the minimal set of removals that allows us to keep a connected set? Actually, we are going to remove k nodes, so we are keeping n-k nodes. The problem asks for the k districts to remove.\n\n We want to remove the smallest set (in terms of fan value?) of districts that breaks the connectivity? Actually, we want to remove the districts that have the smallest fan value (lowest 2^i) but wait: the fan value is 2^i, which is larger for higher i. However, we want to maximize the total fans, so we want to keep the highest-value ones. \n\n But note: removing a high-value district might allow us to keep more low-value ones? Not necessarily. Actually, we should try to keep the highest-value districts and remove the lowest-value ones, but we must ensure connectivity.\n\n However, the problem is: we are forced to remove exactly k districts, and the remaining must form a connected subgraph.\n\n Let's think: we want to maximize the total fan value, which is the sum of 2^i for the kept districts. Since the function is exponential, we want to keep the largest indices as much as possible.\n\n What is the maximum total fan value? It would be the sum of 2^i for the largest n-k districts? Not necessarily, because connectivity matters.\n\n Example: n=6, k=3. The districts are 1 to 6. The fan values: \n   district 1: 2^1 = 2\n   district 2: 4\n   district 3: 8\n   district 4: 16\n   district 5: 32\n   district 6: 64\n\n The total if we keep the three largest: 64+32+16 = 112? But wait, the example output says that removing districts 1,3,4 gives a total of 2^2+2^5+2^6 = 4+32+64 = 100.\n\n Why isn't 112 the maximum? Because if we keep districts 4,5,6 (which are the three largest), we must check if they form a connected subgraph.\n\n In the first sample: \n   Edges: [2-1, 2-6, 4-2, 5-6, 2-3]\n\n The graph:\n   1-2-3-4? Wait, let me draw:\n\n   Districts: 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n   Edges: \n      2-1\n      2-6\n      4-2\n      5-6\n      2-3\n\n   So the graph is:\n\n       1 - 2 - 3\n           |   |\n           6---5\n           |\n           4\n\n   Actually, wait: the edge list is [2,1], [2,6], [4,2], [5,6], [2,3]. So node 2 is connected to 1,6,4,3.\n\n   Now, if we keep only {4,5,6}: \n        Node 4 is connected to 2, but 2 is not kept. Then 4 is isolated? Also 5 is connected to 6, but 6 is connected to 2 (which is not kept). So actually, in the remaining graph, 4 and 5,6: \n        The edge between 5 and 6 remains, but the edge from 6 to 2 is broken (since 2 is removed) and the edge from 4 to 2 is broken. Therefore, 4 is separate from {5,6}. \n\n   So {4,5,6} is not connected.\n\n   Similarly, if we keep {3,5,6}: \n        Nodes 3 is connected to 2 (removed) -> so 3 is isolated. {5,6} is connected. So again, two components.\n\n   Therefore, we cannot arbitrarily choose the three largest.\n\n How to solve?\n\n Insight: In a tree, the connected set of nodes must form a connected subgraph. The problem is equivalent to: remove k nodes such that the remaining n-k nodes are connected, and we wish to maximize the sum of 2^i for the kept nodes (or equivalently, minimize the sum of 2^i for the removed nodes, but note: the total sum is fixed? No, the kept set is variable).\n\n However, note: the total fan value is fixed for all districts. But wait, no: the kept set is arbitrary. We are not summing over all districts, but only the kept ones.\n\n Since 2^i is exponential, the best strategy is to keep the highest-indexed districts (largest numbers) because 2^i grows so fast. However, we must connect them.\n\n Another idea: we are going to remove k nodes. We want to keep a connected set. The best connected set (maximizing the sum) would be one that includes the highest-indexed nodes and connects them appropriately.\n\n We can use the following:\n\n Step 1: Root the tree arbitrarily (say at node 1). Then, we can compute the parent-child relationships and the entire structure.\n\n Step 2: Notice that the remaining connected set must contain a set of nodes that includes at least one path connecting all the nodes. In fact, the connected set must form a tree (or a forest, but we require connected so one tree) and we are allowed to drop any k nodes.\n\n However, note: the entire original graph is a tree, so the remaining connected set must be a subtree? Actually, it doesn't have to be a full subtree (i.e., we don't require all children to be present) but the induced subgraph must be connected.\n\n Step 3: We wish to maximize the sum of 2^i. Since 2^i is increasing with i, we want to keep the highest-indexed nodes. But sometimes we have to keep a lower-indexed node to connect two higher-indexed ones? \n\n Example: if we have two high-indexed nodes that are not directly connected and the only connection is through a low-indexed node, then we must keep that low-indexed node or break connectivity.\n\n However, note: the exponential growth: 2^i is so large that even if we have to keep a node with a small i, the gain from keeping a node with a very high i might be more than the loss from skipping a few low i's. But the catch is: we are forced to remove exactly k nodes.\n\n Alternate approach: we want to remove k nodes. We can choose which k nodes to remove. The remaining must be connected.\n\n We can consider: what are the necessary nodes to keep? Actually, we don't know. But we can think greedily: we want to keep the highest-indexed nodes, and we want to remove the lowest-indexed ones, but we must ensure connectivity.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to remove any k nodes. So we can consider: if we sort the districts by their fan value (which is 2^i, so by i descending), then we wish to keep the top m (m = n-k) districts. But we must check if these top m districts form a connected subgraph.\n\n But if they don't, we might have to replace some of the lower ones (from the top) with even higher ones? Actually, no: the top m are the highest. The problem is that the top m might not be connected.\n\n Then, we might have to drop one of the top m and include a lower one to get connectivity? That would reduce the total fan value, which we don't want.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a different idea: we must keep a connected subgraph. The minimal connected subgraph that covers a set of nodes is the union of all the simple paths between every pair of nodes. But that is complicated.\n\n Another known fact: in trees, a connected subgraph is determined by a set of nodes and the union of the edges that lie on the simple paths between these nodes.\n\n We can use the following strategy:\n\n 1. Sort the districts by the fan value (i.e., by the index descending) because higher index has more fans.\n 2. We wish to keep the highest-indexed districts, but we must ensure that the kept set is connected.\n\n However, note: the connectivity condition is global. We can use a method similar to \"minimum node cut\" but for connectivity and maximizing the kept set.\n\n But note: we are forced to remove exactly k nodes, so we are keeping n-k. We wish to maximize the total fan value.\n\n Another known approach: we can use dynamic programming or greedy removal from the leaves? But note n up to 10^6.\n\n Insight: the problem is equivalent to: find a connected subgraph with n-k nodes (so we remove k nodes) that maximizes the sum of 2^i.\n\n Since 2^i is exponential, the optimal solution will include the largest indices as much as possible.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We note that the fan value for a node is 2^i, so we prefer higher i.\n\n 2. We can try to build a connected set by starting from the highest-indexed node and then including adjacent nodes that are necessary to connect to other high-indexed nodes. However, this is vague.\n\n Known technique: the problem is similar to \"maximum spanning tree\" but with node weights and connectivity. However, note: we are keeping exactly n-k nodes, and we require connectivity.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n Since the graph is a tree, we can root the tree arbitrarily and then use DFS to compute the size of the subtree (but here we care about connectivity and node values).\n\n However, note: we are allowed to remove any set of k nodes. We wish to maximize the sum of the kept nodes, so we wish to keep the nodes with the largest 2^i.\n\n The key observation: the kept set must be connected. In a tree, the kept set forms a connected subgraph if and only if we do not remove a set of nodes that disconnects the graph. But we are removing exactly k nodes.\n\n We can use the following greedy: we are going to remove k nodes. We wish to remove the nodes that are least valuable (lowest 2^i) and that are not necessary for connecting the valuable nodes.\n\n But note: if we remove a node, we break all connections through that node.\n\n Another idea: we wish to keep a connected set. The best connected set is the one that contains the highest-indexed nodes and is connected. We can use the following:\n\n   - Start by keeping all the highest-indexed nodes (until we have n-k nodes) and then check if they are connected. If not, we need to add some lower ones to connect them? But wait, we are forced to keep exactly n-k nodes. Actually, we are forced to remove k nodes, so we are keeping n-k.\n\n   - But we cannot arbitrarily choose n-k nodes because of connectivity.\n\n How about: we start from the entire set and remove k nodes, but we wish to maximize the kept fan value. However, we cannot iterate over all possibilities.\n\n Instead, we can use a two-step process:\n\n   Step 1: We note that the entire set is connected. We are going to remove k nodes. We wish to remove the ones that have the smallest fan value (because we want to keep the big ones) but without breaking the connectivity? Actually, we wish to remove the smallest fan value nodes that are not necessary for keeping the big ones connected.\n\n   Step 2: We can think of the problem as: we want to keep a connected set S of n-k nodes. Then the removed set is the complement.\n\n   We wish to maximize the sum of 2^i for S.\n\n   Since 2^i is increasing, we want to include the largest indices. But we cannot exclude a large index arbitrarily if it is needed to connect even larger indices? Actually, the indices are from 1 to n, so the largest index is n, then n-1, etc.\n\n   So the candidate set for S is the largest n-k indices? But we saw in the example that {4,5,6} is not connected.\n\n   Then we must include some lower indices to connect the high ones.\n\n   How to determine the minimal set of additional nodes (the ones below the top n-k) that we must keep to ensure connectivity?\n\n   We can use the following: \n\n     Let T be the set of the n-k largest indices.\n\n     Then, we consider the subgraph induced by T. If it is connected, then we are done: we remove all the nodes not in T.\n\n     Otherwise, we need to add some nodes (from the ones we initially excluded) to T to make the entire set connected. But wait, we are constrained by the removal count: we can only remove k nodes, so we must keep exactly n-k nodes. Therefore, we cannot arbitrarily add nodes because then we would exceed n-k.\n\n   Actually, we are keeping exactly n-k nodes. So if the top n-k are not connected, we must replace some of the nodes in T with lower-indexed nodes? But that would decrease the total fan value.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not require that we keep the top n-k. We can choose any set of n-k nodes as long as they form a connected subgraph.\n\n   We wish to maximize the sum. So we want to keep as many high-indexed nodes as possible, but we may have to drop some high-indexed nodes and keep more mid-level ones to maintain connectivity.\n\n   We can use a method that considers the entire tree and the requirement for connectivity. We can use the concept of \"essential\" nodes: nodes that are necessary to connect the high-value parts.\n\n   Another idea: use Kruskal's algorithm in reverse? Since we have a tree, we can use DFS to traverse and decide which nodes to keep.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n     We know that the kept set must form a connected subgraph. We are allowed to remove k nodes. We wish to maximize the sum of kept nodes.\n\n     We can use a greedy algorithm that repeatedly removes the leaf node with the smallest fan value (lowest 2^i) until we have removed k nodes, provided that after removal the remaining graph is still connected? But note: if we remove a leaf, we break the graph into two parts? Actually, removing a leaf doesn't break connectivity of the rest (if the leaf is the only connection to a part, then removing it disconnects that part). However, we are allowed to remove any k nodes arbitrarily, and we require the remaining to be connected.\n\n     But note: we are not forced to remove leaves. We can remove any node. However, if we remove a non-leaf node, we break more connections.\n\n     Insight: The optimal strategy is to remove the k nodes with the smallest fan values (i.e., the smallest indices) that are not necessary to keep the graph connected. But what does \"necessary\" mean?\n\n     We can consider: the entire graph is connected. We wish to remove k nodes and leave a connected graph. The minimal connected subgraph that we can leave is a spanning tree of the original graph, but we are leaving n-k nodes. However, we wish to maximize the sum, so we want to keep the nodes with the largest 2^i.\n\n     We can use the following theorem: the maximum total fan value is achieved by keeping a connected subgraph that includes the largest indices and as many as possible, but we cannot avoid including some smaller indices if the larger ones are disconnected.\n\n     Steps:\n\n        1. Sort the districts by fan value descending (i.e., by index descending).\n        2. We will consider the districts from highest to lowest. We wish to keep a district if and only if we can connect it without breaking the connectivity of the set we are building.\n\n     However, note: we are forced to keep exactly n-k nodes.\n\n     Alternate known solution for similar problems (like keeping a connected subgraph with maximum total weight) is to use the following:\n\n        - Consider the entire set of nodes. We wish to remove k nodes. The remaining must be connected.\n\n        - We can use a two-pass method: first, mark all nodes as initially to be kept (so we are going to keep n-k nodes). Then, we try to remove the nodes with the smallest fan value (lowest index) that are not necessary for connectivity.\n\n     But how to determine if a node is necessary?\n\n     We can use the concept of biconnected components? But the graph is a tree, so there are no cycles.\n\n     In a tree, the connectivity is very simple: the graph is connected if we have a set of nodes that contains at least one node from every maximal path? Actually, we can use the following:\n\n        We can root the tree arbitrarily (say at node 1). Then, we can compute the parent and depth.\n\n        Then, we can do a DFS/BFS to mark the nodes that are necessary to connect the kept set.\n\n     However, we are going to remove k nodes. We wish to remove the ones with the smallest fan value (lowest index) that are not necessary.\n\n     Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Mark all nodes as candidates to be removed (initially we are going to remove k nodes, so we start by assuming we remove k nodes arbitrarily).\n\n        Step 2: We wish to keep the n-k nodes with the largest fan value. But we must ensure connectivity.\n\n        Step 3: We can use a method to check connectivity of the top n-k nodes. But how?\n\n     We can use DSU (union-find) to check the connectivity of the top n-k nodes. But note: the induced subgraph of the top n-k nodes might not be connected. Then we must add some lower nodes to connect them? But wait, we cannot add because we are forced to keep exactly n-k.\n\n     Actually, we are forced to keep exactly n-k nodes. So if the top n-k are not connected, we must replace some of them with lower-indexed nodes (which we were planning to remove) to make the entire set connected. But then the total fan value decreases.\n\n     How to choose replacements? We wish to minimize the loss. Since the fan value is 2^i, the loss of replacing a node x (with fan value 2^x) by a node y (with fan value 2^y) is 2^x - 2^y. But note, we are forced to keep n-k nodes.\n\n     However, note: we are not forced to keep the top n-k. We can keep a different set of n-k nodes that is connected and has a higher total fan value than the top n-k set? \n\n     Actually, the top n-k set (by fan value) is the set of the n-k largest fan values. Any other set of n-k nodes will have a sum <= this set. But if the top n-k set is not connected, then we must use a set that is not the top n-k, meaning we have to drop some high-value nodes and include some low-value ones to achieve connectivity.\n\n     Therefore, the problem reduces to:\n\n        We wish to choose a connected set S of n-k nodes that maximizes the sum of 2^i for i in S.\n\n     How to compute that? We can use a greedy algorithm that starts from the entire set and removes the smallest fan value nodes that are not necessary for connectivity until we have removed k nodes, and then check that the remaining is connected? But that might not work because we are forced to remove exactly k, and the connectivity might break earlier.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n        We know that the entire graph is a tree. We wish to remove k nodes and leave a connected graph. The connected graph must be a tree (actually, a forest becomes a tree if we remove nodes). The condition for a set of nodes to be connected in a tree is that for any two nodes, the entire path between them must be present.\n\n        We can use a DFS to compute the diameter or the longest path in the tree? Not directly.\n\n     Another known idea: the connected subgraph with maximum total weight (here the weight is 2^i) is achieved by taking the entire set of nodes and then removing the ones with the smallest weight that are not necessary for connectivity. But how to define \"necessary\"?\n\n     We can use the following: \n\n        Let W be the set of nodes we wish to keep. Initially, we wish to keep the n-k largest fan values.\n\n        Then, we can use a method to check if W is connected. If it is, we are done.\n\n        If it is not, then we must add some nodes (from the removed set) to connect the components of W, and then remove some other nodes to keep the size n-k. But note, adding a node increases the size, so we have to remove an extra node.\n\n        However, we are constrained by the removal count: we must remove exactly k nodes. So if we start with the top n-k, and then we need to add m nodes (from the bottom k nodes) to connect the components, then we must remove an additional m nodes from the top n-k set. But then the total kept nodes becomes n-k + m - m = n-k? Actually, no: we started with n-k, then we remove m nodes from the top set and add m nodes from the bottom set, so the total kept is still n-k.\n\n        But we wish to maximize the total fan value. The change: we remove m nodes from the top set (with fan values A1, A2, ..., Am) and add m nodes from the bottom set (with fan values B1, B2, ..., Bm). The change in total fan value is (sum(Bi) - sum(Ai)). We wish to minimize the damage (maximize the change, but note: we want the final total to be as large as possible, so we want to minimize the decrease).\n\n        However, we are forced to do this until the set is connected.\n\n     But note: there might be multiple ways to connect the components. We need to find the minimum number of nodes to add (and which ones) to connect W, and then remove the smallest fan value nodes from W (or the ones that cause the least damage) to make room.\n\n     However, the problem constraints (n up to 10^6) make it difficult to try all possibilities.\n\n     After reading the sample: \n\n        Input: n=6, k=3 -> keep 3 nodes.\n\n        The answer is to remove districts 1,3,4 -> keep 2,5,6.\n\n        The top 3 by fan value (largest indices) are 4,5,6. But {4,5,6} is not connected. So we must replace some of {4,5,6} with others.\n\n        What if we replace 4 with 2? Then the set is {2,5,6}. Check connectivity: \n            Original edges: \n                2-1, 2-6, 4-2, 5-6, 2-3.\n            Removing 1,3,4: \n                The edges remaining: 2-6, 5-6, and 2-6 is the same as 6-2, and 5-6. \n                But note: node 2 is connected to 6, and 5 is connected to 6, so {2,5,6} is connected.\n\n        The total fan value: 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4+32+64 = 100.\n\n        What if we replace 4 with 3? Then the set is {3,5,6}. \n            Node 3 is connected to 2 (removed) -> so 3 is isolated. The set {3,5,6} is not connected.\n\n        What if we replace 4 with 1? Then the set is {1,5,6}. \n            Node 1 is connected to 2 (removed) -> isolated.\n\n        What if we replace two nodes? For example, remove 4 and also remove 5, and keep 4 and 2 and 6? Then the set is {2,4,6}. \n            Check connectivity: \n                2-4: yes (edge exists)\n                2-6: yes\n                4-6: no direct edge, but via 2: so connected.\n            Total fan value: 2^2 + 2^4 + 2^6 = 4+16+64 = 84, which is less than 100.\n\n        Or remove 4 and 6, and keep 2,5, and what else? We must keep 3 nodes. We are forced to keep 3. We started with {4,5,6} and we want to keep 3. If we remove 4 and 6, then we must keep 5 and two others. But we are allowed to choose any set of 3 nodes that is connected. \n\n        How do we know that {2,5,6} is the best?\n\n        We want to maximize the sum. The set {2,5,6} has sum 100. The set {4,5,6} (if connected) would have been 16+32+64=112, but it is not connected. The next best sets are those that drop one of the top three and include a lower one.\n\n        We must consider: we are allowed to choose any connected set of 3 nodes. We wish to maximize the sum.\n\n        Candidates: \n          - {5,6, and one more}: \n              With 2: 4+32+64 = 100.\n              With 3: 8+32+64 -> but {3,5,6} is not connected.\n              With 4: 16+32+64 -> but {4,5,6} is not connected.\n              With 1: 2+32+64 -> {1,5,6} is not connected.\n\n          - {4,5, and one more}:\n              With 2: 4+16+32 = 52, and check connectivity: {2,4,5}: \n                  Edges: 2-4, and 5-6 (but 6 is not there) and 5 is not connected to 2? Actually, no edge between 5 and 2. And 5 is connected to 6, but 6 is removed, so 5 is isolated from {2,4}. So not connected.\n              With 3: 8+16+32 -> {3,4,5}: \n                  Edges: 3 is connected to 2 (removed), 4 is connected to 2 (removed), and 5 is connected to 6 (removed). So no edges remain -> not connected.\n              With 1: 2+16+32 -> {1,4,5}: \n                  Edges: 1 is connected to 2 (removed), 4 to 2 (removed), 5 to 6 (removed). Not connected.\n\n          - {4,6, and one more}:\n              With 2: 4+16+64 = 84 -> connected? {2,4,6}: \n                  Edges: 2-4 and 2-6 -> so yes, connected.\n              With 3: 8+16+64 -> {3,4,6}: \n                  Edges: 3 is connected to 2 (removed), 4 to 2 (removed), 6 to 2 and 5 (removed) -> no, not connected.\n              With 5: already considered.\n\n          - {3,5,6}: not connected.\n\n          - {2,3,5}: 4+8+32 = 44 -> connected? \n                  Edges: 2-3 is present, but 2-5? No, 5 is connected to 6 (removed) -> so 5 is isolated. Not connected.\n\n          - {2,3,6}: 4+8+64 = 76 -> connected? \n                  Edges: 2-3, 2-6 -> so yes.\n\n          But 76 < 100.\n\n        So the best is {2,5,6} with 100.\n\n        How did we get {2,5,6}? We replaced the node 4 (which was in the top 3) with node 2. Note that node 2 is not in the top 3 (the top 3 by index are 4,5,6; node 2 has index 2, so fan value 4). \n\n        We removed districts 1,3,4. That is, we removed the three smallest indices (1,3,4) and kept the three largest indices except we replaced 4 with 2. But wait, 2 is not among the top 3 by index? Actually, the indices are 1,2,...,6. The fan values: \n          1:2, 2:4, 3:8, 4:16, 5:32, 6:64.\n\n        The top 3 by fan value (largest) are 6,5,4 (64,32,16). Then we removed one of them (4) and included 2 (which is lower) and removed two others (1 and 3) which are even lower.\n\n        But note: we are only allowed to remove k=3. The set we keep is 3 nodes. We kept 2,5,6.\n\n        The total fan value is 4+32+64=100.\n\n        How to generalize?\n\n        Observation: In a tree, the optimal solution is to keep a connected set that includes the highest-indexed node (the largest fan value) and then as many as possible of the next highest, but we must include all the nodes along the unique paths between the chosen high-indexed nodes.\n\n        However, we wish to maximize the sum. Since the fan value grows exponentially, we want to keep the highest-indexed nodes, but we might have to include some lower ones to connect them.\n\n        Steps for a solution:\n\n        1. We note that the highest-indexed node (say node n) must be kept, because if we don't keep it, we can always swap it with a node that is not kept and get a larger sum? Not necessarily, because maybe the node n is a leaf and disconnecting it requires including a node that is very valuable? But since 2^n is the largest, we definitely want to keep it.\n\n        2. Then, we wish to keep the next largest nodes, but we must ensure connectivity.\n\n        We can use the following algorithm:\n\n          - We are going to keep a set S of nodes. Initially, we keep all nodes with index >= some threshold, but we don't know the threshold.\n\n          - We can use a two-pointer or a greedy approach:\n\n          Let's consider the nodes sorted by index descending (from n down to 1). We will try to build a connected set by including nodes from high to low.\n\n          However, we wish to include as many high-indexed nodes as possible, but we are limited to n-k nodes.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Let S = {} (set of kept nodes)\n            We wish to have |S| = n-k.\n\n            We start from the highest index and go down, and we include a node if and only if it is connected to the current set by an edge that goes to a node already in S? But wait, that would be DFS-like and we would miss the possibility that a node is needed to connect two parts.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a method similar to Prim's algorithm but on the tree, but the tree is unweighted in terms of connectivity, but weighted by fan value.\n\n        After further thought, note: the exponential growth means that including a node with a high index is very beneficial. We wish to keep the node n, then node n-1, then node n-2, etc., but we must ensure that the set remains connected.\n\n        We can use a union-find to simulate the connectivity of the top n-k nodes. But we don't know which ones to keep.\n\n        Another idea: \n\n          We wish to keep a connected set of n-k nodes. The entire graph has n nodes. We can use the following: \n\n          Let dp[u] be the maximum fan value we can achieve in a connected set in the subtree rooted at u, but that doesn't work because the tree is not rooted and we care about the whole tree.\n\n        After reading the sample outputs and the problem constraints, note that the intended solution might be simpler.\n\n        Insight from the sample: the president removes the smallest k districts (by index) that are not necessary for connecting the remaining set. But the remaining set must be connected.\n\n        However, the sample output removes districts 1,3,4 (the smallest three by index) but then the kept set is {2,5,6} which is connected. Why didn't we simply remove the smallest three and keep the largest three? Because the largest three (4,5,6) are not connected.\n\n        So the algorithm:\n\n          Step 1: Find the connected components of the graph induced by the top n-k nodes (by index). \n\n          Step 2: If there is only one component, then we are done: remove all nodes not in the top n-k.\n\n          Step 3: If there are multiple components, then we need to add some nodes (from the removed set) to connect these components. But we are constrained by the total number of kept nodes being n-k.\n\n          How many additional nodes do we need to add? At least (number_of_components - 1) nodes (as bridges). But then we must remove an equal number of nodes from the top n-k set.\n\n          However, we wish to minimize the damage to the total fan value. \n\n          We can use a multi-step process:\n\n            Let T = set of the n-k largest indices.\n            Let C = the set of connected components of the subgraph induced by T.\n\n            If |C| == 1, then we are done.\n\n            Otherwise, we need to reduce the number of components to 1 by adding some nodes (from the complement) and removing some nodes from T.\n\n            But note: adding a node from the complement might connect two components, and then we can remove one node from T (the one that is least valuable) to keep the size n-k.\n\n            However, we must ensure that the added node is adjacent to at least two different components? In a tree, a node can connect two components if it is adjacent to both.\n\n            Steps:\n\n              While the number of components in T is greater than 1 and we have removals available (we have removed fewer than k nodes):\n\n                - We can consider adding a node v (not in T) that is adjacent to two different components of T. Adding v will merge the components that are adjacent to v. Then we remove one node from T (the one with the smallest fan value in T) to keep the total size n-k.\n\n                - But note: we are allowed to remove exactly k nodes. Initially, we planned to remove k nodes: the n - (n-k) = k nodes not in T. But if we add a node v (which we were going to remove anyway) then we must remove one node from T to keep the size n-k.\n\n                - The net effect: we remove one node from T and add one node from the complement. The change in total fan value is (2^v - 2^u) where u is the removed node from T and v is the added node.\n\n                - We wish to minimize the damage, i.e., we wish to maximize (2^v - 2^u). But since 2^v is small (because v is not in the top n-k, so v < the smallest index in T) and 2^u is large (because u is in T, the top set), this change will be negative (damage). However, we have no choice if we want connectivity.\n\n            But is this always the case? What if there is a node v (not in T) that is adjacent to two components and also has a large fan value? But v is not in T, so v is not among the largest indices. So 2^v is relatively small",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected subgraph and the total number of fans from the remaining districts is maximized. The fan value for each district is given by \\(2^i\\), where \\(i\\) is the district number. The key observation here is that higher-numbered districts contribute more to the total fan value due to the exponential growth of \\(2^i\\). Therefore, our goal is to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible while ensuring they remain connected.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves a tree structure where each node represents a district. We need to remove k nodes such that the remaining nodes form a connected component. The challenge is to maximize the sum of \\(2^i\\) for the kept nodes. Given the exponential nature of \\(2^i\\), higher-numbered nodes should be prioritized.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The optimal solution involves keeping the highest-numbered nodes possible. However, if these nodes are not connected, we need to include some lower-numbered nodes to bridge the gaps, thereby reducing the total fan value. The solution requires balancing between keeping high-value nodes and maintaining connectivity.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Sorting**: First, we sort all districts in descending order of their indices (since higher indices have higher fan values).\n   - **Union-Find Data Structure**: We use this to efficiently manage and merge connected components as we process each district.\n   - **Component Tracking**: For each district from highest to lowest index, we check if it connects existing components. If merging components reduces the total number of components, we proceed; otherwise, we consider removing lower-indexed districts if necessary.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each district once, performing union-find operations which are nearly constant time due to path compression and union by rank. Thus, the overall complexity is \\(O(n \\alpha(n))\\), where \\(\\alpha(n)\\) is the inverse Ackermann function, making it efficient for large \\(n\\) (up to \\(10^6\\)).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nsys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k_remove = int(data[1])\n    edges = []\n    index = 2\n    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        graph[a].append(b)\n        graph[b].append(a)\n    \n    sorted_nodes = list(range(1, n + 1))\n    sorted_nodes.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    parent = list(range(n + 1))\n    rank = [0] * (n + 1)\n    components = [set() for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    comp_count = n\n    \n    def find(x):\n        if parent[x] != x:\n            parent[x] = find(parent[x])\n        return parent[x]\n    \n    def union(x, y):\n        nonlocal comp_count\n        rx = find(x)\n        ry = find(y)\n        if rx == ry:\n            return False\n        if rank[rx] < rank[ry]:\n            parent[rx] = ry\n            components[ry] |= components[rx]\n            components[rx] = set()\n            return True\n        elif rank[rx] > rank[ry]:\n            parent[ry] = rx\n            components[rx] |= components[ry]\n            components[ry] = set()\n            return True\n        else:\n            parent[ry] = rx\n            rank[rx] += 1\n            components[rx] |= components[ry]\n            components[ry] = set()\n            return True\n    \n    current_components = set()\n    kept_nodes = set()\n    removed_nodes = set()\n    for i in range(k_remove, n):\n        node = sorted_nodes[i]\n        kept_nodes.add(node)\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            if neighbor in kept_nodes:\n                continue\n            if find(node) != find(neighbor):\n                if union(node, neighbor):\n                    comp_count -= 1\n                    break\n    else:\n        for node in sorted_nodes[:k_remove]:\n            removed_nodes.add(node)\n        print(\" \".join(map(str, sorted(removed_nodes))))\n        return\n\n    while len(kept_nodes) < n - k_remove:\n        candidate_node = None\n        min_fan = float('inf')\n        for node in sorted_nodes[k_remove:]:\n            if node not in kept_nodes:\n                candidate_node = node\n                break\n        if candidate_node is None:\n            break\n        \n        if candidate_node in current_components:\n            continue\n        \n        found = False\n        for neighbor in graph[candidate_node]:\n            if neighbor in kept_nodes:\n                found = True\n                break\n        if not found:\n            continue\n        \n        fan_val = (1 << candidate_node)\n        best_removal = None\n        min_fan_in_kept = float('inf')\n        for node in kept_nodes:\n            if node not in current_components:\n                continue\n            fan_here = (1 << node)\n            if fan_here < min_fan_in_kept:\n                min_fan_in_kept = fan_here\n                best_removal = node\n        \n        if best_removal is None:\n            break\n        \n        kept_nodes.remove(best_removal)\n        kept_nodes.add(candidate_node)\n        current_components.remove(find(best_removal))\n        current_components.add(find(candidate_node))\n        removed_nodes.add(best_removal)\n        comp_count += 1\n\n    result = sorted(removed_nodes)\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of districts \\(n\\) and the number of districts to remove \\(k\\).
