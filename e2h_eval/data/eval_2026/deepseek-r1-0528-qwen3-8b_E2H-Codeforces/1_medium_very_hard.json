    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The problem describes that the first ring goes along the edge of the plate (which is a rectangle of w x h).\n Then, the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge, and so on.\n\n Each ring has a width of 1 cell. The i-th ring is defined for the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)).\n But note: the ring itself is the border of that inner rectangle. However, we must be cautious because the problem says \"all bordering cells\" for the inner rectangle.\n\n How many cells does the i-th ring have?\n For a rectangle of size a x b, the border (if we consider the outermost layer as the ring) would normally have:\n   If a >= 2 and b >= 2: \n        top and bottom: each row of the top and bottom has b cells, but subtract the corners if we count by sides?\n   Alternatively, we can compute the border as: \n        total = 2 * (a + b) - 4   [because each side has length of the dimension, but the four corners are shared and counted twice]\n\n However, let's break it down for a rectangle of a x b (with a>=2, b>=2):\n   The top side: a cells? Actually, no: the rectangle has a rows and b columns.\n   Actually, the border consists of:\n        top row: b cells\n        bottom row: b cells\n        left column (without the top and bottom): a - 2 cells\n        right column (without the top and bottom): a - 2 cells\n\n   So total border = 2*b + 2*(a-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n But wait, note that the example: \n   Input: \"3 3 1\" -> Output: 8\n   Let's compute: \n        w=3, h=3, k=1.\n        The first ring uses the entire border of the 3x3? \n        Using the formula: 2*3 + 2*3 - 4 = 6+6-4 = 8 -> matches.\n\n   Next: \"7 9 1\" -> Output: 28\n        Here, w=7, h=9, k=1.\n        Formula: 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14+18-4 = 32, which is not 28.\n\n Wait! Let me reexamine the problem statement: \n   \"the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — 2 cells away from the edge and so on.\"\n\n   The example picture (third example) is provided, but the input examples are:\n        ['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2'] -> outputs [8, 28, 40]\n\n   So for 7x9, the first ring (k=1) gives 28.\n\n   Let me visualize: \n        The first ring is the outer border of the 7x9 plate.\n        The border of 7x9: \n            top and bottom: 9 cells each -> 9*2 = 18\n            left and right: 7-2 = 5 cells each (because the top and bottom are already taken) -> 5*2 = 10\n            total = 18+10 = 28.\n\n   So the formula for the border of a rectangle of a x b is: 2*a + 2*b - 4, but note: in our example above, we did use 2*7+2*9-4=32, which is not 28.\n\n   Why the discrepancy?\n\n   Actually, note: the problem says \"along the edge\", and then the second ring is 2 cells away. \n\n   The key is: the rings are drawn by considering an inner rectangle. Specifically, the first ring is the border of the entire plate (w x h). \n   The second ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (w-4) x (h-4)? \n\n   But wait: the problem states: \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1)) x (h - 4(i-1))\".\n\n   So for the first ring (i=1): \n        inner rectangle: (w - 0) x (h - 0) = w x h.\n        Then the ring is the border of this w x h. \n\n   However, note that the border of a rectangle of a x b is only defined when a>=1 and b>=1. But also, if the rectangle has a single row or column, then the border might be different.\n\n   But the problem says: \n        There should be k gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — 2 cells away from the edge and so on.\n\n   And the condition: k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) so we won't get negative dimensions.\n\n   Now, let's compute the first ring for 7x9: \n        The ring is the border of a 7x9. \n        How many cells? \n          Top row: 9 cells\n          Bottom row: 9 cells\n          Left column: from row1 to row7, but without the top and bottom? Actually, the border is the set of cells that are either in the first row, last row, first column, or last column.\n\n        So: \n          Top row: 9\n          Bottom row: 9\n          Middle rows: the leftmost and rightmost columns, but we must avoid counting the corners twice. \n          So for the middle rows (from row index 1 to row index 5, because 7 rows: indices 0 to 6), there are two columns (leftmost and rightmost) but without the top and bottom rows.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use the standard formula for the perimeter of a grid (but note: each cell is one unit, and the border is the outer shell).\n\n        The standard way is: \n          Total border cells = 2*w + 2*h - 4   (this is the same as 2*(w+h)-4)\n\n        But wait, for 7x9: 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14+18-4 = 32, but expected is 28.\n\n   What's going on?\n\n   Let me draw a small grid:\n\n        Consider 7x9: \n          We have 7 rows and 9 columns.\n\n        The border includes:\n          Row0: 9 cells\n          Row6: 9 cells\n          Columns0 and 6 (for rows 1 to 5): that's 8 rows (from row1 to row5) * 2 columns = 16 cells.\n\n        So total = 9 + 9 + 16 = 34? \n\n   Alternatively, think of the border as the set of cells (i,j) such that i is 0 or 6, or j is 0 or 6.\n\n        Count the cells with i=0: 9\n        i=6: 9\n        i from 1 to 5: j=0: 5 cells, j=8 (since the last column index is 8): 5 cells -> 10 more.\n\n        Total = 9+9+10 = 28.\n\n   So how to calculate generally?\n\n        For a rectangle of a x b (a rows, b columns, 0-indexed so the indices go from 0 to a-1 and 0 to b-1):\n\n        The border cells are those with i=0, i=a-1, j=0, j=b-1.\n\n        So the total number of border cells is:\n            top row: b\n            bottom row: b\n            left column (excluding top and bottom): a - 2\n            right column (excluding top and bottom): a - 2\n\n        Therefore: total = b + b + (a-2) + (a-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n        But wait, for 7x9: 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14+18-4 = 32, but we just counted 28.\n\n   Why the discrepancy in counting? \n\n   In the drawing, we considered the top row and bottom row as having the entire row, and then the sides excluding the top and bottom. \n\n   However, the formula 2*a + 2*b - 4 counts the entire border by including the entire top and bottom rows (which are of length b) and the entire left and right columns (which are of length a). But then the four corners are counted twice (each corner is part of both a row and a column). So we subtract 4.\n\n   But then why did the direct count give 28?\n\n        Direct count for 7x9:\n            top row: 9\n            bottom row: 9\n            left column (without top and bottom): 5 (rows 1 to 5)\n            right column (without top and bottom): 5\n            total: 9+9+5+5 = 28.\n\n   Alternatively, using the formula: 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 32.\n\n   There is a mismatch.\n\n   Let me break down the standard formula:\n\n        Standard formula for the border of a grid (without double-counting the corners) is indeed 2*(a+b) - 4.\n\n        But wait, what is the grid representation? \n\n        Example 3x3: \n            Standard formula: 2*(3+3)-4 = 12-4=8 -> correct.\n\n        Example 7x9: \n            Using standard formula: 2*(7+9)-4 = 32.\n\n        But our direct count was 28.\n\n   What's the issue?\n\n   In the direct count, we did not count the entire left and right columns, but only the middle part. \n\n        The entire left column (including top and bottom) has 7 cells, but we already counted the top and bottom in the top and bottom rows. Similarly for the right column.\n\n        So the correct way to count without double-counting is to do:\n\n            top row: 9\n            bottom row: 9\n            left column: 7 - 2 (because the top and bottom are already included) = 5\n            right column: 7 - 2 = 5\n\n        Then total = 9+9+5+5 = 28.\n\n   But wait, the standard formula 2*(a+b)-4 counts:\n\n            top row: b\n            bottom row: b\n            left column: a (entire left column, including top and bottom) -> but then the top and bottom are already in the top and bottom rows, so we have double-counted the top-left and bottom-left.\n\n            Similarly, right column: a (entire right column, including top and bottom) -> double-counted top-right and bottom-right.\n\n        So the standard formula actually counts:\n            top row: b\n            bottom row: b\n            left column: a (so we have added the entire left column, including the top and bottom which were already in the top and bottom rows)\n            right column: a\n\n        Then we subtract 4 to remove the double-counting of the four corners.\n\n        So the total becomes: b + b + a + a - 4 = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n        But in reality, the top row and bottom row already include the leftmost and rightmost columns for those rows. So if we add the entire left column (a cells) we are adding the top-left and bottom-left again (which are already in the top and bottom rows). Similarly for the right column.\n\n        This leads to overcounting by exactly 4 (the four corners). \n\n        However, in our manual count we avoided the corners in the side columns. \n\n        Actually, the two methods are consistent: \n\n            Standard formula: 2*a + 2*b - 4 = 2*7+2*9-4 = 32.\n\n        But wait, 32 is the total if we count the entire grid and then take the border by the method of \"all cells that are in the first row, last row, first column, or last column\", and then subtract nothing? \n\n        Actually, the set of border cells is the union of the first row, last row, first column, last column. \n\n        How many elements are in the union?\n\n            |first row| = b\n            |last row| = b\n            |first column| = a\n            |last column| = a\n\n            But the intersections: \n                first row and first column: 1 (top-left)\n                first row and last column: 1 (top-right)\n                last row and first column: 1 (bottom-left)\n                last row and last column: 1 (bottom-right)\n\n            Also, the first row and last row don't intersect the first/last column except at the corners? Actually, no, because the entire grid is rectangular.\n\n            By inclusion-exclusion:\n\n                |union| = |first row| + |last row| + |first column| + |last column|\n                         - |first row ∩ first column| - |first row ∩ last column| \n                         - |last row ∩ first column| - |last row ∩ last column|\n                         + (intersections of three? and four?) \n\n            But note: the intersections of three sets: \n                first row ∩ first column ∩ last row -> empty, because first row and last row are disjoint unless a==1, but a>=3.\n                Similarly, any three sets will be empty.\n\n            So:\n\n                |union| = a + a + b + b \n                         - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 \n                         = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n        Now, for 7x9: 2*7+2*9-4 = 32.\n\n        But wait, in our direct count we did:\n\n            top row: 9\n            bottom row: 9\n            left column: 5 (because we excluded the top and bottom)\n            right column: 5\n\n            total = 9+9+5+5 = 28.\n\n        This is different. \n\n   Why the difference? \n\n        The standard inclusion-exclusion counts the entire first column (which is 7 cells) and the entire last column (7 cells). \n\n        But note: the entire first column includes the top and bottom, which are already in the top and bottom rows. \n\n        Our direct count only counted the middle part of the columns (the part that is not the top and bottom). \n\n        However, the problem defines the ring as the border of the inner rectangle. \n\n        For the first ring, the inner rectangle is the entire plate (w x h). So the ring should be the border of the entire plate, which is the entire first row, entire last row, entire first column, entire last column. \n\n        That means the ring includes the entire first and last columns (all rows) and the entire first and last rows (all columns). \n\n        Then the count is 32 for 7x9? \n\n        But the example output is 28.\n\n   Let me check the example input: \n        Input: \"7 9 1\" -> Output: 28.\n\n   So the problem's example output is 28, meaning that they are counting only the border as the outer frame, and the frame of a 7x9 grid should be 28.\n\n   This suggests that the intended definition of the border is not the entire set of the first/last row and column, but the set of cells that are adjacent to the inside. \n\n   However, note the problem statement: \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1)) × (h - 4(i-1))\".\n\n   The example picture (third example) is provided, but we don't have the picture. \n\n   Let me read the example inputs again:\n\n        Input: \"3 3 1\" -> Output: 8.\n\n        For 3x3, the border: \n            Entire first row: 3\n            Entire last row: 3\n            Entire first column: 3 (but then the top-left and top-right are already in the top row, and similarly for the last row) -> but wait, the entire first column is 3, and the entire last column is 3.\n\n            Then by inclusion-exclusion: 3+3+3+3 - 4 = 12-4=8.\n\n        So for 3x3, the standard formula (2*(3+3)-4) gives 8, which matches.\n\n        Now, 7x9: \n            Standard formula: 2*(7+9)-4 = 32, but expected is 28.\n\n   This is confusing.\n\n   Another possibility: the problem's \"bordering cells\" for the inner rectangle of size a x b is the set of cells that are in the outer layer of that inner rectangle. \n\n   But note: the inner rectangle for the first ring is the entire plate (7x9). The border of the entire plate should be the same as the standard border.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"the first one should go along the edge of the plate\", meaning the very outer edge. \n\n   Why then is the answer 28 for 7x9?\n\n   Let me recount for 7x9:\n\n        The entire plate is 7x9.\n\n        The outer ring (first ring) is the set of cells that are in the outermost layer.\n\n        How many cells are in the outermost layer?\n\n            Top row: 9 cells\n            Bottom row: 9 cells\n            The middle rows (rows 1 to 5): only the leftmost and rightmost columns, which are 2 cells per row, and there are 5 rows (from row1 to row5) -> 5*2 = 10.\n\n            Total: 9+9+10 = 28.\n\n        But note: the entire left column (column0) has 7 cells, but we have already counted the top and bottom of column0 in the top and bottom rows. Similarly for column8.\n\n        So if we try to count by columns:\n\n            Column0: 7 cells (from row0 to row6)\n            Column8: 7 cells (from row0 to row6)\n\n            Then we would have counted the corners twice.\n\n        But wait, if we count the entire left and right columns, then we have 7+7 = 14, and then the top and bottom rows (without the corners) would be:\n\n            Top row without the corners: 9 - 2 = 7\n            Bottom row without the corners: 9 - 2 = 7\n\n            Then total = 14 + 7 + 7 = 28.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the standard border formula but without the corners being counted twice? \n\n        Actually, the standard border formula is the same: \n\n            total = 2*(a+b) - 4\n\n        but wait, for 7x9: 2*(7+9)-4 = 32, which is not 28.\n\n   After careful thought, I realize:\n\n        The problem states that the i-th ring is drawn on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). \n\n        The ring itself is the border of that inner rectangle. \n\n        However, note that the entire plate is the first ring's inner rectangle, so the ring is the border of the entire plate. \n\n        But the example output for 7x9 is 28, and our direct count (by breaking into top, bottom, and sides without the corners) is 28.\n\n        How is this related to the formula for the border?\n\n        Let me define a function for the border of a rectangle of a x b (a rows, b columns):\n\n            If a == 1 or b == 1, then it's a linear strip, but note the constraints: w, h>=3 and k>=1, and k is limited so that the inner rectangle remains positive.\n\n            Otherwise, the border (the outer ring) of a rectangle of a x b is:\n\n                If a == 1 and b == 1: 1\n                But we know a>=3, so we don't need to worry about that.\n\n            Actually, we can define:\n\n                border(a, b) = \n                    if a == 1: then the entire rectangle is one row, so the border is the entire row? but wait, the ring is the border of the inner rectangle. \n                    However, the problem says the rings are drawn by stepping inwards by 2 cells each time (so 4*(i-1) reduction in both dimensions). \n\n            But note: the problem states that the i-th ring uses the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)), and then the ring is the border of that inner rectangle.\n\n            The border of an inner rectangle of size a x b (with a>=2, b>=2) is 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n            However, for a=7, b=9: 2*7+2*9-4 = 32, but the example says 28.\n\n        There is a misunderstanding.\n\n        Let me re-read the problem: \n            \"the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — 2 cells away from the edge\"\n\n        The plate is w x h.\n\n        The first ring: \n            inner rectangle = w x h.\n            The ring is the border of that inner rectangle.\n\n        The second ring: \n            inner rectangle = (w-4) x (h-4)\n            Then the ring is the border of that inner rectangle.\n\n        But wait, the example input \"7 9 2\" gives 40.\n\n        How do we get 40 for two rings?\n\n        First ring (k=1) for 7x9: \n            We have 28.\n\n        Second ring (k=2) for 7x9:\n            The inner rectangle is (7-4) x (9-4) = 3x5.\n\n            The border of 3x5: \n                Using the standard formula: 2*3+2*5-4 = 6+10-4 = 12.\n\n            Then total gilded cells = 28 + 12 = 40.\n\n        So the example output for \"7 9 2\" is 40.\n\n        Therefore, the first ring is indeed 28, and the second ring is 12.\n\n        Now, why is the first ring 28?\n\n        The problem says the first ring is the border of the entire plate (7x9). \n\n        But wait, the border of 7x9 by the standard formula is 2*7+2*9-4 = 32, but we are told the answer is 28.\n\n        This indicates that the problem's \"border\" for a rectangle a x b is not the entire outer frame, but the outer frame minus the corners? \n\n        Or maybe the problem considers the ring as the set of cells that are adjacent to the inner part, but the inner part for the first ring is the entire plate, so the ring is the set of cells that are on the border of the plate and are not the next ring? \n\n        Actually, the problem states: \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1))×(h - 4(i-1))\"\n\n        Let me parse this: \n\n            The inner rectangle is of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1))\n\n            Then, the ring is the border of that inner rectangle.\n\n        But note: the inner rectangle is the area that is being framed. The border of the inner rectangle is the set of cells that are immediately outside the inner area and form the ring.\n\n        However, the entire plate is the first inner rectangle. The border of the first inner rectangle (7x9) is the set of cells that are in the outer frame of the 7x9. \n\n        But the example output is 28.\n\n        What if the problem means the border as the set of cells that are not the next inner rectangle? \n\n        Actually, the problem doesn't specify that. It says the ring is the border of the inner rectangle.\n\n        Another possibility: the problem's \"bordering cells\" for a rectangle of a x b is defined as the set of cells that are on the edge of the rectangle, but note that the rectangle is defined by the grid. \n\n        The grid has w rows and h columns. The first ring is the set of cells that are in the first row OR the last row OR the first column OR the last column.\n\n        But wait, that is exactly the standard border (which is 32 for 7x9). \n\n        However, the example output is 28.\n\n        Unless the problem is not counting the entire border, but rather the border of the inner rectangle as the set of cells that are part of the ring and not the inner part, but the ring is drawn by removing the next ring? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not say that. It says the first ring is the border of the entire plate.\n\n        After reading the problem statement again: \n            \"the first one should go along the edge of the plate\"\n\n        The plate is the entire grid. The edge of the plate is the outermost cells. \n\n        The outermost cells of a 7x9 grid are:\n\n            Row0: 9 cells\n            Row6: 9 cells\n            Column0: from row0 to row6 -> but row0 and row6 are already counted, so the new cells are rows1 to 5: 5 cells\n            Column8: similarly 5 cells\n\n        So total: 9+9+5+5 = 28.\n\n        This is the same as the direct count.\n\n        How can we express this in a formula?\n\n            For a rectangle of a x b (a>=2, b>=2), the border (as defined by the problem) is:\n\n                top: b\n                bottom: b\n                left: a - 2   [because the top and bottom of the left column are already counted]\n                right: a - 2\n\n            So total = 2*b + 2*(a-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n        But wait, that is the same standard formula! \n\n        Then why for 7x9: 2*7+2*9-4 = 32, but we got 28?\n\n        Now I see the mistake: \n\n            The standard formula counts the entire left and right columns (each of length a) and then subtracts 4 for the four corners (because the corners are counted twice). \n\n            But in our direct count, we broke the left and right columns into two parts: the top and bottom (already counted) and the middle (a-2). \n\n            However, the standard formula does not break the columns. \n\n            The standard formula counts the entire left column (a cells) and entire right column (a cells) and entire top and bottom rows (b cells each). Then it subtracts 4 (the four corners). \n\n            The entire left column is a, but the top and bottom of the left column are already included in the top and bottom rows. So the standard formula is correct in terms of set union (it uses inclusion-exclusion) but the result is 32.\n\n        Why did our direct count yield 28?\n\n        Let me recount for 7x9 by the standard union:\n\n            Set A = top row: 9 cells\n            Set B = bottom row: 9 cells\n            Set C = first column: 7 cells\n            Set D = last column: 7 cells\n\n            The union: |A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D|\n\n            We can use inclusion-exclusion:\n\n                |A| = 9\n                |B| = 9\n                |C| = 7\n                |D| = 7\n\n                |A∩C| = 1 (the top-left cell)\n                |A∩D| = 1 (the top-right cell)\n                |B∩C| = 1 (the bottom-left cell)\n                |B∩D| = 1 (the bottom-right cell)\n\n                |A∩B| = 0 (since a>1, so top and bottom are distinct)\n                |A∩C∩D| = 0, etc.\n\n            So |A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = 9+9+7+7 - 1-1-1-1 = 32 - 4 = 28.\n\n        Ah! The standard formula I recalled (2*(a+b)-4) is actually derived from the inclusion-exclusion above, but note:\n\n            The entire top and bottom rows are of length b, and the entire left and right columns are of length a.\n\n            Then the formula is: 2*b + 2*a - 4.\n\n            But wait, 2*b + 2*a - 4 = 2*9 + 2*7 - 4 = 18+14-4 = 32-4? -> wait, 18+14 is 32, then minus 4 is 28? \n\n            Actually, 2*b + 2*a - 4 = 2*9 + 2*7 - 4 = 18+14-4 = 32-4=28.\n\n        So the formula is: 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n        But wait, I did:\n\n            total = 2*b + 2*a - 4 = 2*9 + 2*7 - 4 = 18+14-4 = 28.\n\n        But earlier I computed 2*7+2*9-4 as 14+18-4=32. \n\n        There is no difference: 2*7+2*9 is the same as 2*9+2*7.\n\n        So the formula is: 2*(a+b) - 4.\n\n        And for 7x9: 2*(7+9)=32, then 32-4=28.\n\n        But wait, that is not the same as 2*a+2*b-4. \n\n        Actually, 2*a+2*b-4 is the same as 2*(a+b)-4.\n\n        So for 7x9: 2*(7+9)-4 = 2*16-4 = 32-4 = 28.\n\n        So the formula is correct.\n\n        Why did I think it was 32? \n\n        Because I did 2*7+2*9-4 and then 14+18=32, then 32-4=28. \n\n        So the formula is: 2*(a+b) - 4.\n\n        And for 3x3: 2*(3+3)-4 = 12-4=8.\n\n        And for 3x5 (the second ring in 7x9): \n            a=3, b=5: 2*(3+5)-4 = 16-4=12.\n\n        Then for two rings: 28+12=40.\n\n        Therefore, the solution is:\n\n            We are given w, h, k.\n\n            For the i-th ring (from 1 to k), the inner rectangle has dimensions:\n                a_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n                b_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n            But note: the ring is the border of the inner rectangle, and the border has size: 2*(a_i + b_i) - 4, provided that a_i>=2 and b_i>=2.\n\n            However, the problem states that k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4), so the inner rectangle for the last ring will have at least 3 in the smaller dimension? \n\n            Actually, the condition: k <= floor((min(n, m)+1)/4) ensures that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has positive dimensions.\n\n            But note: if a_i < 2 or b_i < 2, then the border formula breaks. However, the condition on k ensures that:\n\n                The smallest dimension of the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is: min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) >= 3 - 4*(k-1) ... but wait, the condition is floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) >= k, so min(w,h) >= 4*(k-1)+ something.\n\n            Actually, the condition is: k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n            For example, if w=7, h=9, then min=7, floor((7+1)/4)=floor(8/4)=2. So k<=2.\n\n            For k=2: the inner rectangle is (7-4)=3, (9-4)=5. Both >=3 (which is >=2), so the formula holds.\n\n            But if we had k= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4)+1, then the inner rectangle might have negative dimensions or one dimension too small. But the problem states k is within the limit.\n\n            Therefore, we can compute for each ring i (from 1 to k):\n\n                a_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n                b_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n                cells_i = 2*(a_i + b_i) - 4\n\n            Then, the total number of cells is the sum of cells_i for i=1 to k.\n\n        However, wait: is the ring the border of the inner rectangle, or is it the border of the previous rectangle minus the next one? \n\n        The problem says the first ring is the border of the entire plate, the second ring is the border of the inner rectangle (which is 3x5). \n\n        But note: the second ring is drawn 2 cells away from the edge, so it is inside the first ring. \n\n        However, the problem does not say that the rings are disjoint. \n\n        Actually, the rings are drawn independently on the inner rectangles. \n\n        The first ring: 7x9 -> 28 cells.\n        The second ring: 3x5 -> 12 cells.\n\n        And the example output for two rings is 40.\n\n        Therefore, we simply sum the borders of the inner rectangles for each ring.\n\n        But wait, what if the rings overlap? \n\n        The problem says: \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1))×(h - 4(i-1))\"\n\n        This means that the rings are drawn independently. However, note that the second ring is drawn on a smaller rectangle that is completely inside the first one. \n\n        But the border of the entire plate (first ring) is the outer frame, and the border of the inner rectangle (second ring) is the frame that is 2 cells in from the outer frame. \n\n        These two frames do not overlap.\n\n        Therefore, the total gilded cells is the sum over i from 1 to k of [2*(a_i+b_i)-4] where a_i = w-4*(i-1), b_i = h-4*(i-1).\n\n        Example 1: \"3 3 1\"\n            w=3, h=3, k=1\n            a1 = 3, b1=3\n            cells1 = 2*(3+3)-4 = 12-4=8 -> output 8.\n\n        Example 2: \"7 9 1\"\n            w=7, h=9, k=1\n            cells1 = 2*(7+9)-4 = 2*16-4 = 32-4=28 -> output 28.\n\n        Example 3: \"7 9 2\"\n            k=2\n            i=1: 2*(7+9)-4 = 28\n            i=2: a2=7-4=3, b2=9-4=5 -> 2*(3+5)-4 = 16-4=12\n            total = 28+12 = 40 -> output 40.\n\n        Therefore, code:\n\n            Read w, h, k.\n\n            total_cells = 0\n            for i in range(1, k+1):\n                a = w - 4*(i-1)\n                b = h - 4*(i-1)\n                # If the inner rectangle becomes too small (a<2 or b<2) then the border would be 0 or negative, but the condition on k ensures we don't have that.\n                # But the problem condition: k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) so we are safe.\n                if a < 2 or b < 2:\n                    # According to the condition, this should not happen, but if it does, skip.\n                    break\n                total_cells += 2*(a+b) - 4\n\n            print(total_cells)\n\n        However, note: the problem says the plate is split into w x h cells. The dimensions a and b must be at least 1. But the border formula requires at least",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate after adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is placed 2 cells away from the edge of the previous ring, starting from the outer edge of the plate. The key insight is that each ring corresponds to the border of an inner rectangle, which is progressively smaller by 4 cells in both dimensions for each subsequent ring.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to compute the number of cells in each ring formed around the plate. The first ring is the outermost border of the plate, the second ring is 2 cells inward from the first, and so on. Each ring's border is defined by the dimensions of an inner rectangle, which reduces by 4 cells in both width and height for each subsequent ring.\n2. **Intuition**: For each ring, the number of cells in its border can be calculated using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, adjusted to avoid double-counting the corners. Specifically, the formula is \\(2 \\times (a + b) - 4\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the dimensions of the current inner rectangle.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate through each ring from 1 to \\(k\\). For each ring, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle by reducing the original plate dimensions by \\(4 \\times (i-1)\\) in both directions. Use the perimeter formula to calculate the cells in the current ring's border and accumulate the total cells.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in \\(O(k)\\) time, where \\(k\\) is the number of rings. Since \\(k\\) is constrained to be at most \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\min(w, h) + 1}{4} \\right\\rfloor\\), the solution efficiently handles the input constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total_cells = 0\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        a = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n        b = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n        if a < 2 or b < 2:\n            break\n        total_cells += 2 * (a + b) - 4\n    print(total_cells)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: \\(w\\) (width), \\(h\\) (height), and \\(k\\) (number of rings).\n2. **Initialization**: Initialize `total_cells` to zero to accumulate the sum of cells in all rings.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to \\(k\\):\n   - Calculate the dimensions of the inner rectangle by subtracting \\(4 \\times (i-1)\\) from both \\(w\\) and \\(h\\).\n   - If either dimension becomes less than 2, break the loop as further rings would not contribute any cells.\n   - Apply the perimeter formula \\(2 \\times (a + b) - 4\\) to compute the cells in the current ring's border and add it to `total_cells`.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the accumulated total number of cells after processing all rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the total cells by leveraging the geometric properties of concentric rectangles and ensures correctness within the given constraints.",
