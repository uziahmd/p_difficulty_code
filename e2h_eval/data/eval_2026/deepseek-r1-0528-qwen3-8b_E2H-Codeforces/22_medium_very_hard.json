After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read the first line to get n and m.\n Then, we read the next n lines, each containing a string of m digits.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We need to know for each subject, what is the maximum mark? (since best means highest mark)\n 2. However, note: there might be multiple students with the same highest mark in a subject. But the problem says: \n    \"a student is the best at some subject if there is no student who got a higher mark\". So if two students have the same highest mark, then they are both considered best in that subject.\n\n 3. For a student to be successful, he must be the best in at least one subject.\n\n Alternate approach:\n   - Let's create a list `max_marks` for each subject (each column) which is the maximum digit in that column (converted to integer, but we can compare as characters since '1' to '9').\n   - Then, for each student, check for each subject: if his mark equals the maximum mark for that subject, then he is best in that subject.\n\n However, note: we don't need to know the maximum per subject separately for each student? Actually, we can precompute the maximum per subject.\n\n But wait: what if a subject has maximum mark 9, and two students have 9, then both are best. So we can do:\n\n   Step 1: Read n and m.\n   Step 2: Read the grid (list of strings)\n\n   Step 3: Precompute a list `max_per_subject` of length m, where for each subject j, max_per_subject[j] = max(grid[i][j] for all i)\n\n   Step 4: For each student (each row), check for any subject j such that grid[i][j] == max_per_subject[j]. If at least one exists, then the student is successful.\n\n   Step 5: Count the number of successful students.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n\n   Grid:\n      ['223', '232', '112']\n\n   max_per_subject:\n      subject0: max('2','2','1') -> '2'\n      subject1: max('2','3','1') -> '3'\n      subject2: max('3','2','2') -> '3'\n\n   Now check each student:\n      Student0: \"223\" -> \n          subject0: '2' == '2' -> True\n          subject1: '2' != '3' -> False\n          subject2: '3' == '3' -> True -> successful\n\n      Student1: \"232\" ->\n          subject0: '2' == '2' -> True -> successful\n\n      Student2: \"112\" ->\n          subject0: '1' != '2' -> False\n          subject1: '1' != '3' -> False\n          subject2: '2' != '3' -> False -> not successful\n\n   So output is 2.\n\n However, note: the example input is given as a string that we have to parse. The example input format is:\n\n      Input: \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n\n   But actually, the input is provided via stdin. We can use:\n\n        import sys\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n   Then first line: first_line = data[0].split() -> [n_str, m_str]\n\n   Then the next n lines are the grades.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Read the first line to get n and m.\n\n   Then, we read the next n lines.\n\n   However, note: the input might be given in a single string as shown in the example, but the problem says: \n        \"The first input line contains two integers n and m ... Next n lines each containing m characters\"\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            grid.append(input().strip())\n\n   But note: the example input is given as a string that includes the newline. Since we are reading from stdin, the input() function will read one line.\n\n   Alternatively, if we are getting the entire input as a multi-line string, we can split by newline.\n\n   However, the problem states the input format. We assume standard input.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   Edge: n=1, m=1; or when there are no successful students.\n\n   Example 2: \n        Input: \"3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111\"\n\n        n=3, m=5\n        Grid:\n            ['91728', '11828', '11111']\n\n        max_per_subject: \n            subject0: max('9','1','1') -> '9'\n            subject1: max('1','1','1') -> '1'\n            subject2: max('7','8','1') -> '8'\n            subject3: max('2','2','1') -> '2'\n            subject4: max('8','8','1') -> '8'\n\n        Check student0: \"91728\"\n            subject0: '9'=='9' -> True -> successful.\n\n        student1: \"11828\"\n            subject0: '1' != '9' -> False\n            subject1: '1'=='1' -> True -> successful.\n\n        student2: \"11111\"\n            subject0: '1' != '9' -> False\n            subject1: '1'=='1' -> True -> successful.\n\n        So output is 3.\n\n   This matches the sample.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            grid.append(input().strip())\n\n        # Precompute the maximum for each subject (column)\n        max_per_subject = []\n        for j in range(m):\n            col_max = '0'\n            for i in range(n):\n                if grid[i][j] > col_max:\n                    col_max = grid[i][j]\n            max_per_subject.append(col_max)\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            successful = False\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grid[i][j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n                    successful = True\n                    break\n            if successful:\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n   Let me test with the examples.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the marks are from 1 to 9, so we don't have 0. But our initial col_max is '0', which is less than any mark (since marks are from '1' to '9').\n\n   Alternatively, we can initialize col_max as the first element of the column, but the above loop handles it.\n\n   But let's consider: if n==0, then we skip. But n>=1.\n\n   This should work.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\" and they are given as a string of m characters.\n\n   We are reading each line as a string and stripping (to remove any trailing spaces or newlines). Since the input doesn't have spaces, this is safe.\n\n   Let's run the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \n            3 3\n            223\n            232\n            112\n\n        Our code: \n            n=3, m=3\n            grid = ['223','232','112']\n\n            max_per_subject:\n                j0: '2','2','1' -> '2'\n                j1: '2','3','1' -> '3'\n                j2: '3','2','2' -> '3'\n\n            Then check each student:\n\n            Student0: '2'=='2' -> True, so successful. Also '3'=='3' -> True, but we break after first True. Doesn't matter.\n\n            Student1: first char '2'=='2' -> True -> successful.\n\n            Student2: no True -> not successful.\n\n            Output: 2.\n\n   Example 2: \n        Input:\n            3 5\n            91728\n            11828\n            11111\n\n        Output: 3.\n\n   It works.\n\n   But note: the problem says the input may be provided as a single string? Actually, the example input is given as a string that includes the newlines.\n\n   However, in competitive programming, we usually read from stdin line by line.\n\n   Since the problem says \"The first input line\", then the next n lines, we can use:\n\n        import sys\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        if not data: \n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n\n        n, m = map(int, data[0].split())\n        grid = data[1:1+n]\n\n   But the problem does not specify if there are extra lines. The problem says \"Next n lines\", so we assume exactly n lines.\n\n   However, the problem says \"Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\" meaning each row is one line.\n\n   We'll go with the first method (using input) because the constraints are small (n, m <= 100). \n\n   But if the input is coming from a file or pipe, using input() is safe.\n\n   However, note that in some online judges, using input() might be slow for large input, but here n, m <=100, so no problem.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   One more edge: if there is only one student.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: \n            1 1\n            1\n\n        Then max_per_subject: for subject0: '1'\n        Student0: '1'=='1' -> True -> successful, so output 1.\n\n   Another: \n        Input:\n            1 1\n            2\n\n        Output: 1.\n\n   And if two students, one with the highest mark and the other with lower? \n\n        Input: \n            2 1\n            2\n            1\n\n        max_per_subject: ['2']\n        Student0: '2'=='2' -> True -> successful.\n        Student1: '1' != '2' -> not successful.\n\n        Output: 1.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Therefore, we can submit the following code.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input is given as a string in the example: \n        ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n   But in reality, we are reading from stdin. In the example, they are showing two examples. But we are writing one program that reads one input set.\n\n   So we assume one input set.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # Precompute the maximum for each subject (column)\n        max_per_subject = []\n        for j in range(m):\n            col_max = grid[0][j]\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                if grid[i][j] > col_max:\n                    col_max = grid[i][j]\n            max_per_subject.append(col_max)\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grid[i][j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break\n\n        # But wait: the above counts one successful student per subject? No, we break the inner loop for a student once we find one subject.\n\n        # Actually, the above code breaks the inner loop (the j loop) for a student once we find one subject where he is best. Then we count the student and move to the next.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        #   successful = False\n        #   for j in range(m):\n        #       if grid[i][j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n        #           successful = True\n        #           break\n        #   if successful: count += 1\n\n        # But the above code I wrote earlier is:\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            successful = False\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grid[i][j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n                    successful = True\n                    break\n            if successful:\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n   Or we can use the second version (with the break) and a flag.\n\n   Both are acceptable.\n\n   Let me write the code with the flag.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            grid.append(input().strip())\n\n        # Precompute max for each column\n        max_cols = [max(grid[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\n        # Alternatively, we can use list comprehensions for the max_cols, but the above is clear.\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grid[i][j] == max_cols[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break\n\n        # Wait, this counts the first successful subject for a student and then moves on, but note: we are counting the student once per subject found? \n\n        # Actually, no: the above counts the student once (because we break the inner loop and then the outer loop continues to the next student). But wait, the above code does not break the outer loop, but the inner loop. \n\n        # However, the above code does:\n\n        #   For student i, we iterate j from 0 to m-1 until we find one j such that grid[i][j]==max_cols[j]. Then we break the inner loop and then the outer loop goes to the next i.\n\n        # But then we are not counting the student multiple times. The above code would count a student every time we find a subject? Actually, no: because we break the inner loop and then we are done with that student. \n\n        # But wait, the above code does not have an if condition to break out of the inner loop and then continue to the next student. Actually, the way we did: we break the inner loop and then we don't do anything else for that student. Then we move to the next student.\n\n        # However, the above code does not account for the fact that we are breaking the inner loop and then we don't mark the student as successful. We are just counting the student once (because we break and then the next student) but we are counting the student by doing `count += 1` for each student that we break the inner loop? \n\n        # Actually, no: the above code without the flag is incorrect because we break the inner loop but we don't know if we found one. However, note: we break the inner loop only when we find one. But then we are counting the student as soon as we find one. \n\n        # But wait, the above code does:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(m):\n                    if grid[i][j] == max_cols[j]:\n                        count += 1\n                        break\n\n        # This will count the student the first time we find a subject. But what if the student is best in two subjects? Then we break at the first one and count the student, then the rest of the subjects for that student are skipped. That's correct because we only need one.\n\n        # However, this code does not require an explicit flag. But note: if a student is best in two subjects, we break at the first one and count the student. Then we don't check the remaining. That's okay.\n\n        # But wait: what if the student is not best in any subject? Then the inner loop completes without breaking, and we don't add to count. Correct.\n\n        # However, there is a catch: the above code will break the inner loop as soon as it finds one, but then we move to the next student. \n\n        # But the above code is equivalent to:\n\n            count = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(m):\n                    if grid[i][j] == max_cols[j]:\n                        count += 1\n                        break\n\n        # But note: the same student might be counted twice if we didn't break? We break, so no.\n\n        # However, the above code is correct.\n\n        # But wait: the example with two students and one subject:\n\n            Input: \n                2 1\n                2\n                1\n\n            max_cols = [ '2' ]\n\n            i=0: j=0: '2'=='2' -> True, then count becomes 1, break inner loop.\n            i=1: j=0: '1'!='2' -> then inner loop ends naturally, no break, so count remains 1.\n\n            Output: 1 -> correct.\n\n        # But let me try a student that is best in two subjects:\n\n            Input:\n                1 2\n                99\n\n            max_cols: \n                subject0: '9', subject1: '9'\n\n            i=0: \n                j=0: '9'=='9' -> True, count becomes 1, break inner loop.\n\n            Output: 1 -> correct.\n\n        # So the code is:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # Compute max for each column j\n        max_cols = []\n        for j in range(m):\n            col_vals = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n            max_cols.append(max(col_vals))\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grid[i][j] == max_cols[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break\n\n        print(count)\n\n   However, note: the max_cols are characters. The grid[i][j] is a character. So comparing characters is the same as comparing their integer values? \n        But note: '9' is greater than '8', etc. and the ASCII ordering is the same as numerical for the digits '1' to '9'. \n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But we can also do:\n\n        max_cols = [str(max(map(int, [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]))) for j in range(m)]\n\n   However, that would convert to integers, then take max, then convert back to string. But the problem says the marks are from 1 to 9, so we can compare as characters.\n\n   The simpler way is to use the character comparison.\n\n   But note: the example uses string of digits, so we are safe.\n\n   However, the problem says the marks are from 1 to 9, so we don't have negative or other characters.\n\n   Let me stick to the character comparison.\n\n   But wait: what if the input has leading zeros? The problem says from 1 to 9, so no.\n\n   Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input is given as a string of m characters (without spaces). \n\n   One last thing: if the input has a newline at the end of each line, we used input().strip(), which removes any trailing/leading whitespace. But the problem says the marks are numbers from 1 to 9, and the input format is exactly m characters. So we can rely on the input being clean.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid strip if the input doesn't have extra spaces. But the problem says \"not separated by spaces\", so we can use:\n\n        grid.append(input().strip())\n\n   to be safe.\n\n   Let me submit the code.\n\n   But wait, the example input was given as:\n\n        ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n   This is a list of two strings. How do we read that?\n\n   Actually, in the problem statement, the example input is shown as two separate examples. Our code is for one test case.\n\n   Since the problem is competitive programming and typically one test case is provided, we assume one test case.\n\n   If we are to read from stdin, the input is provided as described.\n\n   We are good.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        max_cols = []\n        for j in range(m):\n            col_vals = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n            max_cols.append(max(col_vals))\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grid[i][j] == max_cols[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break\n\n        print(count)\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1:\n\n        Input: \n            3 3\n            223\n            232\n            112\n\n        Output: 2\n\n   Example 2:\n\n        Input:\n            3 5\n            91728\n            11828\n            11111\n\n        Output: 3\n\n   It works.\n\n   However, note: the example input is given as a string that includes the newlines. The input() function reads one line at a time.\n\n   But what if the input has spaces? The problem says the marks are not separated by spaces, so we don't worry.\n\n   We are ready.\n\n   But wait, the problem says the input is given as:\n\n        ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n   This is a representation of two inputs. Our code reads the first line and then the next three lines for the first example.\n\n   Since the problem states the input format, we assume the input is given as described.\n\n   We'll submit.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"Print the single number\", so we only print one number per test case.\n\n   The code above prints one number.\n\n   We are done.\n\n   But wait, the example input is provided as a string that we have to parse. Actually, in the example, the input is given as:\n\n        Input: ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n   This is a list of two strings. But in the actual input, we don't have a list. We have standard input.\n\n   In competitive programming, the input is provided via standard input. The example is just showing two different test cases.\n\n   We assume the input is provided as:\n\n        First line: n m\n        Next n lines: each a string of m digits.\n\n   We have handled that.\n\n   Let me write the code again for clarity.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input is given as a string in the example. But in practice, we use the above.\n\n   But wait, the problem statement example is:\n\n        Input:\n            ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n        Output:\n            ['2', '3']\n\n   This is confusing because they are showing the input as a list and output as a list. But in reality, the input is provided as two separate lines for the first test case and then five for the second? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"The first input line contains two integers n and m ... Next n lines ...\"\n\n   So the entire input for the first test case is:\n\n        3 3\n        223\n        232\n        112\n\n   And for the second test case:\n\n        3 5\n        91728\n        11828\n        11111\n\n   But the example input is given as a list of two strings, each string containing the entire test case including the newlines.\n\n   Since the problem is about one test case, we assume we are reading one test case.\n\n   The code above is for one test case.\n\n   We are good.\n\n   However, if the judge runs multiple test cases, then we have a problem. The problem statement says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then describes the input. It does not say there are multiple test cases.\n\n   According to the problem, there is one test case.\n\n   We assume one test case.\n\n   Therefore, the code is as follows.\n\n   Note: There might be an issue if the input has extra spaces or empty lines. But the problem says the input format.\n\n   We'll assume well-formatted input.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # Create a list for the maximum of each subject (column)\n        max_subjects = [max(grid[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            found = False\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grid[i][j] == max_subjects[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break\n\n        print(count)\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        max_subjects = [max(col) for col in zip(*grid)]\n\n   This is a common trick to transpose the grid and then take the max of each column.\n\n   Let me explain:\n\n        zip(*grid) gives us tuples of the columns. For example, grid = ['223','232','112'] \n        *grid becomes ('2','2','1'), ('2','3','1'), ('3','2','2')\n        Then zip(*grid) gives: [('2','2','3'), ('2','3','2'), ('1','1','2')] -> wait, no.\n\n        Actually, no: \n\n            grid = ['223','232','112']\n            *grid -> unpacks the list of strings, so zip('223','232','112') -> \n            [('2','2','1'), ('2','3','1'), ('3','2','2')]\n\n        Then max(('2','2','1')) -> '3'? No, wait: the max of the tuple of characters is the lexicographically largest. But for digits, lex order is same as numeric.\n\n        But wait, in the example: \n            First tuple: ('2','2','1') -> max is '2'\n            Second: ('2','3','1') -> max is '3'\n            Third: ('3','2','2') -> max is '3'\n\n        So max_subjects = ['2','3','3'] -> which is correct.\n\n        So we can write:\n\n            max_subjects = [max(zip(*grid))]\n\n        But wait, no: we need to do for each column, so:\n\n            max_subjects = [max(x) for x in zip(*grid)]\n\n        Then:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n            max_subjects = [max(x) for x in zip(*grid)]\n\n        Then proceed.\n\n   This is more concise.\n\n   Let me test with the example:\n\n        grid = ['223','232','112'] -> \n        zip(*grid) = zip('223','232','112') -> \n            [('2','2','1'), ('2','3','1'), ('3','2','2')]\n\n        Then max_subjects = [max(('2','2','1')), max(('2','3','1')), max(('3','2','2'))] \n            -> ['2','3','3'] -> correct.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n        # Transpose the grid to get columns\n        # But note: if m is 0, then zip(*grid) will return nothing, but n>=1 and m>=1.\n\n        max_subjects = [max(x) for x in zip(*grid)]\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grid[i][j] == max_subjects[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break\n\n        print(count)\n\n   This is shorter.\n\n   However, note: the grid is stored as list of strings, and each string is of length m. The zip(*grid) will give m tuples, each of length n.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait, what if the grid has different lengths? The problem says each row has m characters. So we are safe.\n\n   We'll use this version.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # If there are no subjects (m==0) then the grid is empty, but m>=1 by constraints.\n        max_subjects = [max(x) for x in zip(*grid)]\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grid[i][j] == max_subjects[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break\n\n        print(count)\n\n   Let me test with the two examples.\n\n   Example1: \n        n=3, m=3, grid = ['223','232','112']\n        max_subjects = [max(('2','2','1')), max(('2','3','1')), max(('3','2','2'))] -> ['2','3','3']\n        Then check student0: \n            j0: '2'=='2' -> True, count becomes 1, break inner loop.\n        student1: \n            j0: '2'=='2' -> True, count becomes 2, break inner loop.\n        student2: \n            j0: '1' != '2', j1: '1' != '3', j2: '2' != '3' -> no, so count remains 2.\n\n        Output: 2.\n\n   Example2: \n        n=3, m=5, grid = ['91728','11828','11111']\n        max_subjects = [max(('9','1','1')), max(('1','1','1')), max(('7','8','1')), max(('2','2','1')), max(('8','8','1'))]\n            -> ['9','1','8','2','8']\n\n        student0: \n            j0: '9'=='9' -> True -> count=1, break.\n        student1:\n            j0: '1' != '9', j1: '1'=='1' -> True -> count=2, break.\n        student2:\n            j0: '1' != '9', j1: '1'=='1' -> True -> count=3, break.\n\n        Output: 3.\n\n   It works.\n\n   We'll submit this version.\n\n   Note: The performance is O(n*m) which is acceptable for n, m <= 100.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # If the grid is empty, then n=0, but n>=1.\n\n        # Use zip to transpose and get the max for each column\n        max_subjects = [max(x) for x in zip(*grid)]\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grid[i][j] == max_subjects[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break\n\n        print(count)\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves processing a grid of marks where each row represents a student and each column represents a subject. For each subject, we need to find the highest mark achieved by any student. A student is successful if they have the highest mark in at least one subject.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves two main steps: \n   - **Finding Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column), determine the highest mark achieved by any student.\n   - **Checking Student Success**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, they are counted as successful.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Transposing the Grid**: Using the `zip` function, we can transpose the grid to process each column (subject) separately.\n   - **Finding Max Marks**: For each column, the maximum mark is found using the `max` function.\n   - **Counting Successful Students**: For each student, iterate through the columns (subjects) to check if their mark matches the highest mark for that subject. If it does, increment the success count.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each cell in the grid once to find the maximum marks per subject (O(n*m)) and then checks each student's marks against these maxima (O(n*m)), resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n*m), which is efficient given the constraints (n, m ≤ 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nif n == 0 or m == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    max_subjects = [max(x) for x in zip(*grid)]\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grid[i][j] == max_subjects[j]:\n                count += 1\n                break\n    print(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of students (n) and subjects (m). The subsequent lines read each student's marks as strings.\n2. **Handling Edge Cases**: If there are no students or subjects, the output is 0 since no students can be successful.\n3. **Finding Maximum Marks**: The grid is transposed using `zip(*grid)` to process each subject (column) separately. The `max` function is applied to each column to find the highest mark.\n4. **Checking Student Success**: For each student, the code checks each subject to see if their mark matches the highest mark for that subject. If found, the student is marked as successful, and the loop breaks early for efficiency.\n5. **Output Result**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects to determine their success status, leveraging grid transposition and simple comparisons for optimal performance.",
