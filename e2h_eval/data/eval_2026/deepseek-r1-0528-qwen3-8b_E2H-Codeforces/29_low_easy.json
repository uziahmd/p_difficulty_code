Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to process the queries in reverse order because the later replacements might affect the earlier ones (e.g., if a digit is replaced by a string that contains digits to be replaced again). However, note that the problem says: \"the queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed\". \n\n But note: if we do the replacements from left to right, then replacing '2' with '00' and then '3' with '' in the example, we must consider that the second replacement (on '3') is applied after the first. However, if we do the replacements from right to left (i.e., reverse the order of queries) we can use dynamic programming or memoization to avoid repeated replacements.\n\n However, note: the problem has multiple queries and the same digit might appear in different queries. The catch: when we replace a digit, the replacement string might contain digits that are also subject to replacement. So we must do all replacements for a digit at once? Actually, we can use a two-pass method:\n\n Idea: Instead of processing each query one by one from left to right, we can process the entire set of queries by building a transformation for each digit (from '0' to '9') that will be applied at the end. But note: the queries are sequential and each query replaces a specific digit. However, if we have:\n\n Query 1: \"2->00\"\n Query 2: \"0->7\"\n\n Then if we do Query1 first, then string \"2\" becomes \"00\", and then in Query2, the '0's become \"7\", so the two zeros become two 7's.\n\n But if we reverse the queries, we can think: we want to know what happens to a digit d after processing all the queries. However, note: the queries are applied in order, and the same digit might appear as a result of a replacement. Therefore, we can precompute for each digit the final string it becomes after all the queries, but note: the queries are applied in sequence, so the transformation for a digit d_i might depend on the transformations of other digits.\n\n Alternate approach: use a system of transformations that are applied in the given order. We can use a graph or a DP that updates the transformations for each digit.\n\n Steps:\n\n Let's define an array `trans` for digits 0-9, initially `trans[d] = str(d)` (the identity).\n\n However, we have n queries. Each query is (d, t) meaning that we replace every occurrence of the digit d (at the time of the query) by the string t. But note: the replacement in a query should be done on the current state of the string, and the current state may have been transformed by previous queries. Therefore, if we have a query that says \"2->00\", then the next query \"0->7\" will replace the zeros that were originally zeros or produced by the first query.\n\n We can process the queries in reverse order and update the transformation for each digit. But note: the transformation for a digit d is defined by the current rule for d, and then the rules for the digits in the replacement string t are applied by the subsequent queries. However, if we reverse the order, we can update the transformation for the digits in t by the already processed (later) queries?\n\n Actually, we can do:\n\n Let f_i(d) be the transformation of digit d after the i-th query (and all subsequent queries). But we are given the queries in the order they are to be applied.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n We are going to precompute the final transformation for each digit. Consider:\n\n Initially, we have 10 digits (0-9). We have n queries. Each query is (d, t). We want to compute the final transformation for each digit, but note that the transformation of a digit d in a query is only applied at that step, and then subsequent queries might change the digits that are in the replacement string.\n\n We can use a reverse processing: process the queries from last to first, and update the transformation for the digit d in the current query to be the transformation of the string t (which now uses the transformations that have been computed for the digits that appear in t, because we've processed the later queries already).\n\n However, note: the problem says the queries are applied in the given order. So the transformation for a digit d is:\n\n   In the first query, we replace d by t0. Then in the next query, we replace some digits (say e) by t1. But note: the t0 might contain digits that are to be replaced by the following queries.\n\n So the idea:\n\n Let `final_trans` be an array for digits 0-9, initially `final_trans[d] = str(d)`.\n\n Then, we process the queries from last to first. For a query (d, t):\n\n   We want to define a new transformation for d: we",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a series of queries that transform a given string of digits by replacing specific digits with other strings. The challenge is to efficiently handle these transformations and compute the resulting number modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7), ignoring leading zeros.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reverse Processing of Queries**: Instead of processing each query in the given order, we reverse the order. This allows us to handle dependencies between queries more effectively. For example, if a digit is replaced by a string containing digits that are later replaced, reversing the queries ensures that subsequent replacements are accounted for first.\n2. **Transformation Mapping**: We maintain a mapping for each digit (0-9) that represents its final transformed string after all queries have been processed. Initially, each digit maps to itself.\n3. **String Transformation**: For each query processed in reverse order, we update the transformation of the queried digit. The new transformation is derived by replacing each character in the replacement string with its current transformed version (based on already processed queries).\n4. **Efficiency**: By processing queries in reverse, we ensure that each transformation step uses the most up-to-date mappings, thus avoiding redundant replacements and optimizing the solution.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 1000000007\n\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = input().strip()\n        parts = line.split('->')\n        d = parts[0].strip()\n        t = parts[1].strip() if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n        queries.append((d, t))\n    \n    trans = {str(i): str(i) for i in range(10)}\n    \n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        d, t_str = queries[i]\n        new_t = ''\n        for char in t_str:\n            new_t += trans[char]\n        trans[d] = new_t\n        \n    result_str = ''\n    for char in s:\n        result_str += trans[char]\n        \n    num = 0\n    for c in result_str:\n        num = (num * 10 + int(c)) % MOD\n        \n    print(num)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an initial string `s` and a series of queries. Each query specifies a digit and a replacement string.\n2. **Reverse Query Processing**: The queries are processed from last to first. For each query, the replacement string is transformed by replacing each character with its current mapped value (from the `trans` dictionary), which has been updated by subsequent queries.\n3. **Building Result String**: After processing all queries, the initial string `s` is transformed by replacing each digit with its final mapped string.\n4. **Modulo Calculation**: The resulting string is converted into a number, taking modulo 1000000007 at each step to prevent integer overflow and ensure correctness.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the transformations by leveraging reverse processing and dynamic updates, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
