His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x in the first line, then two lists of n integers: a (first tour) and b (second tour).\n\n We know that Vasya has at least x points in total. But note: the problem says the results have no names. However, we know that there is one participant (Vasya) who must have two scores (one from a and one from b) such that their sum is at least x.\n\n But note: the input includes all participants' first tour and second tour points, but we don't know which ones belong to Vasya. However, the problem says: \"there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such that ai + bj ≥ x\", meaning that Vasya's two scores are two numbers (one from the first list and one from the second) that sum to at least x.\n\n However, note: the two lists are of the same n participants, but the order is arbitrary. So we have to consider that Vasya is one of the participants, so his score in the first tour is one of the a_i and his score in the second tour is one of the b_j.\n\n The problem: we need to compute the best and worst place Vasya could have.\n\n Approach:\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let S be the set of all participants. Each participant has two scores: (p, q) for the two tours.\n\n But note: we are given two lists: \n   First list: [a1, a2, ..., an] for the first tour.\n   Second list: [b1, b2, ..., bn] for the second tour.\n\n And Vasya is one of them. Actually, the problem states that Vasya was present, so we are guaranteed that there exists at least one pair (a_i, b_j) with i and j (possibly same index? but note: the two lists are independent) such that a_i + b_j >= x.\n\n However, note: the two lists are for the same participants. So each participant i has a_i from the first list and b_i from the second list? Actually, wait: the problem says \"the teacher has the results of the first and the second tour\" and the results are given as two lists of n integers. But it doesn't specify that the i-th element of the first list is the same participant as the i-th element of the second list.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the participants' points in the first tour\" and \"the participants' points in the second tour\". It does not say they are aligned by participant index. Therefore, the two lists are independent. We can assign any a_i to any b_j for the same participant.\n\n However, the problem says: \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\", and the input has two lists of n integers. There are n participants. So we have two multisets: the first tour scores and the second tour scores.\n\n Now, we don't know which a_i and which b_j belong to Vasya. But we know that Vasya's total is at least x.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We want to compute the best and worst place Vasya can get.\n\n 2. The ranking is by the sum of the two tours (and if there are ties, the jury can assign arbitrarily).\n\n 3. We can assume that the other participants are fixed (we know all the a's and b's). But note: we don't know the exact pairing for the other participants either. However, we are allowed to choose the pairing arbitrarily for the entire set? Actually, the problem says: the teacher has the two lists (so the multiset of first tour scores and the multiset of second tour scores). But the pairing between the two tours is arbitrary.\n\n However, note: each participant must have one first tour score and one second tour score. So the pairing is a bijection? Actually, no: the problem does not say that the same participant appears in the two lists. But wait, the problem says: \"each participant of the Olympiard participated in both tours\", and there are n participants. The two lists are the scores of these n participants, but the order is arbitrary.\n\n Therefore, we can rearrange the second list arbitrarily with respect to the first. So we can form a list of pairs (a_i, b_j) arbitrarily (with each a_i and b_j used exactly once). However, note: we are also allowed to assign the same participant to different pairs? Actually, no: each participant gets one a and one b. But since the lists are independent, we can assign the scores arbitrarily.\n\n But wait: the problem says the two lists are the results of the two tours. So each participant has one score in the first tour and one in the second. Therefore, we have two multisets and we are going to form n pairs (each pair being one a and one b) and then the total for a participant is the sum of the two numbers in the pair.\n\n However, the problem does not require that the same index in the two lists corresponds to the same participant. Therefore, we can reassign the second tour scores arbitrarily to the first tour scores.\n\n Therefore, the entire set of participants is defined by the multiset of pairs (a_i, b_j) for all i, j? Actually, no: we have n participants, so we have to use each a_i exactly once and each b_j exactly once.\n\n So the problem reduces to:\n\n   We have two multisets A (size n) and B (size n). We are going to form n pairs (each a from A and each b from B used once) and then the total for a participant is the sum of the two numbers in the pair.\n\n   But note: Vasya is one of the participants. However, we don't know which pair belongs to Vasya. But we are told that there exists a pair (a_v, b_v) such that a_v + b_v >= x.\n\n   However, we are allowed to choose the entire pairing arbitrarily, and also we can choose which pair is assigned to Vasya as long as one of Vasya's possible pairs (from the two lists) satisfies the condition.\n\n But wait: actually, we are not told which pair is Vasya's. However, we know that Vasya is one of the participants, so he must have one a from the first list and one b from the second. But the pairing is arbitrary. So we can assign the pairs arbitrarily. Then, we are allowed to choose any pair for Vasya that has total at least x.\n\n However, note: the condition is that Vasya has at least x, so we can choose a pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya such that a_i+b_j>=x.\n\n But what about the rest? The rest must use the remaining a's and b's.\n\n How do we compute the best and worst place?\n\n Idea:\n\n Let T be the set of all participants. The total for a participant is the sum of his two scores.\n\n We can arrange the participants arbitrarily by choosing the pairing. However, note: the pairing must use each a and each b exactly once.\n\n So the entire set of participants' totals is the set { a_i + b_j } for the chosen pairing.\n\n But note: we are free to assign the b's arbitrarily to the a's. Therefore, the entire set of totals is the multiset { s1, s2, ..., sn } where the s_i are the sums from the pairing.\n\n However, we are allowed to choose the pairing arbitrarily. So we can choose the best pairing for Vasya (to get the best place) and the worst pairing for Vasya (to get the worst place) subject to the condition that Vasya's total is at least x.\n\n But note: we don't know Vasya's exact scores. We only know that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with a_i+b_j>=x that we can assign to him.\n\n However, the problem does not specify which pair is Vasya's. So we have to consider:\n\n   Best case: we assign the highest possible total to Vasya (if that total is at least x) and then arrange the rest so that as many as possible have totals less than Vasya's.\n\n   Worst case: we assign the lowest possible total to Vasya (that is still at least x) and then arrange the rest so that as many as possible have totals greater than or equal to Vasya's.\n\n But wait: we cannot arbitrarily assign the best total to Vasya because the pairing must use all the a's and b's. Actually, we can: the entire pairing is arbitrary.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to assign the pairs arbitrarily. So we can assign to Vasya the pair (a, b) that gives the maximum total, provided that maximum total is at least x. Similarly, we can assign to Vasya the pair (a, b) that gives the minimum total that is still >=x.\n\n But wait: there might be multiple pairs that sum to the same value. However, we can choose the best (largest) total for Vasya and the worst (smallest above x) for Vasya.\n\n However, note: we are also constrained by the fact that the entire pairing must use each element exactly once.\n\n But here is the catch: we are not told which elements are Vasya's. So we can choose any two indices (one from a and one from b) for Vasya, and then the rest of the participants will be formed by the remaining a's and b's.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the two multisets: A and B.\n\n 2. We want to consider two scenarios:\n\n    Scenario 1 (Best place): We assign the maximum possible total to Vasya (so that the total is at least x, and we want to minimize the number of participants with total >= Vasya's total). However, we can also consider: we are going to assign the best total to Vasya, and then for the rest, we can arrange the pairing to minimize the number of participants with total >= Vasya's total.\n\n    But note: the best total overall might be achieved by a particular pair (a_max, b_max). However, we cannot necessarily assign that to Vasya if that pair is forced to be used by someone else? Actually, we can choose arbitrarily. So we can assign the best total to Vasya.\n\n    However, there's a constraint: the entire set of pairs must be formed. So if we assign the best total to Vasya, then we remove that a and that b from the pool, and then we have to form the rest of the pairs from the remaining a's and b's.\n\n    How many participants have total >= Vasya's total in the best case?\n\n        We want to minimize the number of participants with total >= Vasya's total (so that Vasya gets the highest place). But note: we can arrange the rest arbitrarily. Therefore, we can try to make as many participants as possible have totals < Vasya's total.\n\n        However, we cannot break the multiset of the remaining a's and b's arbitrarily. We can form the best arrangement for the rest by matching the largest remaining a's with the smallest remaining b's (to minimize the totals) or the opposite? Actually, to minimize the number of participants with total >= Vasya's total, we want to avoid having high totals in the rest. So we would match the highest remaining a's with the smallest remaining b's, so that the high a's are paired with low b's (and vice versa) to lower the totals.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think: we want to count the maximum number of participants that can have total < Vasya's total (then the rank of Vasya is that count+1, but note: if there are ties, the jury can assign arbitrarily, so we are concerned with the possibility of having more participants with the same total? Actually, in the best case, we can break ties arbitrarily in our favor. But note: we are trying to find the best place, so we assume that the jury is friendly and assigns Vasya the highest place.\n\n        However, the problem says: the teacher has to know the best and worst place Vasya could have.\n\n        We can define:\n\n          Best place: the minimum rank Vasya can achieve (meaning the highest position, so 1 is the best).\n\n          Worst place: the maximum rank Vasya can achieve.\n\n        How to compute the best place?\n\n          Step 1: Choose the maximum total for Vasya (call this T_v = max_{i,j} (a_i + b_j)). But wait, we are allowed to choose any pair for Vasya as long as the total is at least x. However, to get the best place, we want Vasya to have as high a total as possible, so that fewer participants have a total >= T_v.\n\n          But note: we are constrained by the available a's and b's. The maximum total is the maximum value of (a_i + b_j) for any i, j. However, if we use that pair for Vasya, then we remove that a_i and that b_j.\n\n          Then, we are left with two multisets: A' = A without a_i, B' = B without b_j.\n\n          Now, we wish to count the maximum number of participants that can have total >= T_v (excluding Vasya) so that we can assign the rest. But wait, we want the best place: we want as few participants as possible to have total >= T_v (so that Vasya is as high as possible). However, we can arrange the rest arbitrarily. Therefore, we can try to minimize the number of participants with total >= T_v.\n\n          But note: we are allowed to choose the pairing arbitrarily for the rest. So we can form the rest's totals arbitrarily (within the constraints of the multiset A' and B').\n\n          How many participants can have total >= T_v? Actually, we can calculate the maximum number of pairs (from A' and B') that have sum >= T_v. Then the total number of participants with total >= T_v (including Vasya) is that count + 1 (if we consider Vasya separately). Then Vasya's rank would be at most (count + 1) (because there are count others with total >= T_v, and then Vasya). But note: if there are ties, the jury can assign arbitrarily. However, in the best case, we can assume that the participants with the same total as Vasya are placed after Vasya? Actually, no: the problem says the table sorts by decreasing total. If there are ties, the jury can assign arbitrarily. For the best place, we want to minimize the rank (so we assume that all participants with the same total as Vasya are considered to be behind Vasya? Actually, no: the problem doesn't specify. But note: the problem says \"it is up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice\". \n\n          However, for the best place, we are allowed to assign Vasya the first place even if there are others with the same total? Actually, no: the rule is that the table is sorted by total (decreasing) and then the jury breaks ties arbitrarily. But the problem asks for the best and worst place. In the best case, we can assume that when there are ties, we break the tie in favor of Vasya (so that Vasya is assigned the highest place among those with the same total). Similarly, in the worst case, the jury breaks the ties against Vasya.\n\n          But note: the problem does not specify that the pairing is fixed. We can choose the entire pairing arbitrarily (as long as we use each a and each b exactly once). And we are also allowed to choose which pair is assigned to Vasya (as long as the total is at least x). Therefore, we can also choose the pairing for the rest arbitrarily.\n\n          So for the best place:\n\n            We choose the maximum total T_v for Vasya (so we take the maximum possible value from the entire multiset of a_i+b_j, but note: we are constrained by the fact that we have to use one a and one b. However, the maximum total is simply max(A)+max(B)? Not necessarily: because the same index might not be available? Actually, we are allowed to take any a and any b. So T_v can be as high as (max_A + max_B). But wait: we have two multisets and we can take any a and any b. So the maximum total is indeed max_A + max_B.\n\n            However, what if we take that maximum total for Vasya? Then we remove the a_i that is max_A and the b_j that is max_B. Then the remaining multisets are A without max_A and B without max_B.\n\n            Now, we wish to count the number of pairs (from the remaining) that have total >= T_v (which is max_A+max_B). But note: since we removed the two maximums, the maximum total in the remaining set is (next_max_A + next_max_B). This is definitely less than T_v (unless there are duplicates). \n\n            Actually, if there are duplicates, then we might have more than one occurrence of max_A and max_B. Then we can still use the same T_v for Vasya, but then the rest might have some pairs that have total >= T_v? Actually, no: because if we remove one max_A and one max_B, then the next best is (max_A' + max_B'), and unless max_A' and max_B' are also the same as the original max_A and max_B, the total will be less.\n\n            However, if there are duplicates, then we might have multiple participants with the same total. But note: we are only removing one a and one b. Then the rest can form pairs that are as high as (max_A + max_B) again? No, because we only removed one occurrence of max_A and one occurrence of max_B.\n\n            Example: \n              A = [5,5], B = [5,5]. Then the maximum total is 10. If we assign one 5 from A and one 5 from B to Vasya, then the remaining A has [5] and B has [5]. Then the remaining participant has total 10. So then we have two participants with total 10.\n\n            Therefore, the total number of participants with total >= T_v (which is 10) is 2. Then Vasya's rank is 1 (because the jury can break the tie arbitrarily and put Vasya first, but note: the problem doesn't specify the tie-breaking rule for the entire set. However, we are allowed to choose the entire pairing arbitrarily, so we can choose the pairing for the rest arbitrarily. But note: the rest is forced by the multiset: we have to use the remaining a and b. In this example, the rest has one participant with total 10.\n\n            How to count the participants that have total >= T_v? We can form as many pairs as we want that have total >= T_v? Actually, we are constrained by the multiset.\n\n            Alternate approach:\n\n            We can compute:\n\n              Let F(t) = the maximum number of pairs (from the entire set of n pairs) that can have total >= t.\n\n            But note: we are forming one specific pairing for the entire set. However, we are allowed to choose the pairing arbitrarily.\n\n            We can use a greedy matching:\n\n            For the best place scenario:\n\n              Step 1: Assign Vasya the maximum total, T_v = max_A + max_B. (But note: we must check that T_v >= x, otherwise we cannot use that for the best place? Actually, we are allowed to use any pair for Vasya that is at least x. But we want the best place, so we choose the highest total.)\n\n              Step 2: Remove the a_i and b_j that form T_v.\n\n              Step 3: Count the maximum number of pairs (from the remaining n-1 participants) that have total >= T_v. Then the total number of participants (including Vasya) with total >= T_v is (count + 1). Then, because the jury can break ties arbitrarily, the best rank Vasya can get is (count + 1) (meaning: there are count participants with total >= T_v, and then Vasya, so he is last among these). But wait: in the best case, we can break the ties arbitrarily to put Vasya first. However, note: the condition for breaking ties is that the jury can assign arbitrarily. But the problem is: the ranking is by total (decreasing). So if there are k participants with total >= T_v, then Vasya must be at least k (if the jury breaks ties arbitrarily, they can put Vasya in any position from 1 to k). \n\n            Actually, no: the rank is defined by the ordering. The problem says: the best place is the highest rank (lowest number). So if there are k participants with total >= T_v, then Vasya's best rank is k (if the jury puts him last among these k) or 1 (if the jury puts him first)? \n\n            But note: the problem does not specify the tie-breaking rule, but we are allowed to choose the entire pairing arbitrarily. Therefore, we can arrange the rest so that as many as possible have total < T_v, and then the participants with total >= T_v are only the ones we counted (count) plus Vasya. Then the rank of Vasya would be (count+1) (if we consider that the participants with total >= T_v are ordered arbitrarily, but we can put Vasya at the top). However, wait: the problem does not require that we break ties in favor of Vasya. Actually, we are computing the best and worst place.\n\n            Definition of best place: the smallest rank (i.e., highest position) Vasya can achieve.\n\n            In the best case, we can arrange the rest so that Vasya is the only one with total >= T_v? Or we can arrange the rest so that Vasya is the first? Actually, no: the rest might have totals that are >= T_v. We have to count the minimum number of participants (from the rest) that have total >= T_v. But wait, we are allowed to arrange the rest arbitrarily. Therefore, we can minimize the number of participants with total >= T_v (by arranging the rest so that as many as possible have total < T_v). Then the number of participants with total >= T_v is just the number of pairs we can form from the remaining set that have total >= T_v (but we can choose the pairing arbitrarily). However, note: we are forced to use the remaining a's and b's. So we can form a pairing that minimizes the number of participants with total >= T_v.\n\n            Actually, we want to know: what is the minimum number of participants (excluding Vasya) that must have total >= T_v? Then the best rank for Vasya is (min_participants_with_higher_or_equal + 1) [if the jury breaks ties in his favor, then he is first]? \n\n            But wait: let me reframe:\n\n            The entire set of participants (including Vasya) has n participants. We have assigned one (Vasya) with total T_v. The rest n-1 are assigned from the remaining a's and b's arbitrarily.\n\n            The ranking: participants are sorted by total (decreasing). Then, if there are k participants (including Vasya) with total >= T_v, then Vasya's rank is at least k (because there are k-1 participants with total > T_v or equal and then Vasya) but the jury can break ties arbitrarily. However, the problem does not specify that the jury breaks ties in a particular way. But note: the best place we can achieve is when the jury breaks ties in our favor. So if there are k participants with total >= T_v, then the best rank Vasya can get is k (if the jury orders the k participants arbitrarily and puts Vasya first) or k? Actually, the rank is the position. The highest position is 1. The participants with total >= T_v are the top k. The jury can assign the positions arbitrarily. Therefore, the best rank Vasya can get is 1 (if there is at least one participant with total >= T_v, we can put Vasya first). But wait, no: if there is another participant with total >= T_v, then Vasya cannot be first? Actually, no: the jury can break the tie arbitrarily. They can decide that Vasya is first even if there is another participant with the same total.\n\n            However, the problem says: the table is sorted by total (decreasing). Then, if two have the same total, the jury breaks the tie arbitrarily. So the positions are assigned arbitrarily for the tied ones.\n\n            Therefore, the best rank Vasya can get is the number of distinct participants with total strictly greater than T_v plus one (if we break the tie in his favor). But wait: if there are m participants with total strictly greater than T_v, then Vasya's best rank is m+1 (because the m participants are ranked 1 to m, and then Vasya is next). However, if there are ties, the jury can put Vasya above some of the tied participants.\n\n            Actually, the standard way to compute the best and worst rank in a competition with ties is:\n\n              Best rank: (number of participants with total strictly greater than Vasya) + 1\n\n              Worst rank: (number of participants with total strictly greater than Vasya) + (number of participants with total equal to Vasya) + 1\n\n            However, wait: the problem says that the jury breaks ties arbitrarily. So for the best case, we can put Vasya above all the ones with the same total. Then the best rank is (number of participants with total strictly greater than Vasya) + 1.\n\n            For the worst case, we put Vasya below all the ones with the same total. Then the worst rank is (number of participants with total strictly greater than Vasya) + (number of participants with total equal to Vasya) + 1.\n\n            But note: we are allowed to choose the entire pairing arbitrarily (except that Vasya's total must be at least x). Therefore, we can choose Vasya's total arbitrarily from the set of possible totals (as long as >= x) and then arrange the rest arbitrarily.\n\n            Therefore, we need to consider two things:\n\n              - What is the best total we can assign to Vasya? (to minimize the number of participants with total strictly greater than him, and then minimize the number of participants with the same total as him)\n              - What is the worst total we can assign to Vasya? (to maximize the number of participants with total strictly greater than him, and then maximize the number of participants with the same total as him)\n\n            However, we are constrained by the entire set of a's and b's.\n\n            Let me re-read the problem: the teacher has two lists (multisets) of n integers. We can form the n pairs arbitrarily. Then Vasya is one of the participants, so we assign one pair to Vasya (which must be at least x). Then the rest form the other n-1 pairs.\n\n            Steps:\n\n            Let:\n                A = list of first tour points (size n)\n                B = list of second tour points (size n)\n\n            We are going to:\n\n            Part 1: Best place\n\n                We want to minimize the rank (best rank).\n\n                We can choose a pair (a, b) for Vasya such that a+b >= x, and then we want to minimize the number of participants (from the rest) that have total >= (a+b). Moreover, we can arrange the rest arbitrarily.\n\n                To minimize the rank, we want to choose a pair (a, b) for Vasya such that:\n\n                  Condition: a+b >= x.\n\n                  Then, we want to minimize the number of participants (from the rest) that have total >= (a+b). Because the rank of Vasya is (number of participants with total > (a+b)) + 1 (if we break ties in his favor) OR if we break ties arbitrarily, then we can also break the ties in his favor for the ones with the same total.\n\n                Actually, the best rank is:\n\n                  Let T = a+b (chosen for Vasya).\n                  Let g = number of participants (from the entire set) that have total > T. But note: we can choose the pairing arbitrarily for the rest, so we can try to minimize g.\n\n                How to compute the minimum number of participants with total > T (for a fixed T)?\n\n                  We remove the pair (a, b) from the multisets A and B. Then, we have two multisets A' and B'. We wish to form n-1 pairs from A' and B'. We wish to minimize the number of pairs that have total > T.\n\n                But note: we are allowed to choose the pairing arbitrarily. So we can arrange the rest so that as few pairs as possible have total > T.\n\n                How? We can use a greedy matching: to avoid having a high total, we can pair the highest a's with the lowest b's. But wait, we want to minimize the number of pairs that have total > T. So we want to avoid creating pairs with total > T.\n\n                Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n                  Let M = T (Vasya's total). Then, we wish to count the maximum number of pairs (from the rest) that we are forced to have total <= T? Actually, we want the minimum number of pairs that have total > T.\n\n                We can use the following:\n\n                  Let's sort A' and B' (both in increasing order). Then, we can use two pointers to count how many pairs (from A' and B') can be formed with total <= T. But that is not directly what we want.\n\n                Actually, we want to minimize the number of pairs with total > T. That is equivalent to maximizing the number of pairs with total <= T.\n\n                So for the rest, we can form at most (n-1) pairs. The maximum number of pairs we can form with total <= T is, say, m. Then the minimum number of pairs with total > T is (n-1 - m). Then the total number of participants (including Vasya) with total > T is (n-1 - m). Then, the best rank for Vasya is (n-1 - m + 1) [because the participants with total > T are ranked above Vasya] and then Vasya is next? But wait, no: the rank is defined by the entire set. The participants with total > T are ranked above Vasya, and then Vasya is at position (n-1-m+1). However, if there are participants with total == T, then we can break the tie arbitrarily and put Vasya above them. But in this computation, we are only counting the ones strictly greater.\n\n                Actually, the standard competition ranking with ties broken arbitrarily:\n\n                  Let R = number of participants with total strictly greater than T.\n                  Then, the best rank for Vasya is R + 1.\n\n                  But note: we can choose T arbitrarily (from the set of possible pairs) as long as T>=x. And we can choose the pairing for the rest arbitrarily.\n\n                Therefore, we can choose T (Vasya's total) and the pairing for the rest to minimize R.\n\n                How to minimize R?\n\n                  We choose T and then we remove one a and one b (the ones that form T). Then, from the remaining multisets, we wish to minimize the number of pairs that have total > T.\n\n                  Alternatively, we can choose T and then the maximum number of pairs we can form with total <= T is m, then the number of pairs with total > T is (n-1 - m). Therefore, R = (n-1 - m).\n\n                  Then, the best rank is (n-1 - m + 1) = (n - m). But wait, no: R is the number of participants with total strictly greater than T, and then Vasya is next, so his rank is R+1.\n\n                However, we can also choose T arbitrarily (as long as T>=x). We wish to minimize R (the number of participants with total > T) by choosing T appropriately.\n\n                But note: we are allowed to choose the pair for Vasya arbitrarily (any a and any b). Therefore, we can iterate over candidate T's (all possible sums that are at least x) and for each candidate T, we remove one a and one b that sum to T (or at least one pair that sums to T) and then compute m (the maximum number of pairs from the remaining that have total <= T). Then R = (n-1 - m). Then the best rank for that candidate T is R+1.\n\n                Then, we take the minimum best rank over all candidate T's (but note: we want the best rank (minimum rank) so we want the smallest R+1).\n\n                However, note: we are not forced to use a particular T. We can choose any T (any pair) that is at least x. Therefore, we wish to minimize R+1.\n\n                But wait, is that correct? \n\n                Example: n=2, x=0, A=[1,2], B=[3,4]\n\n                Candidate T for Vasya: \n                  T1 = 1+3 = 4 -> remove 1 and 3, then the rest: [2] and [4] -> the pair (2,4) has total 6>4 -> R=1, then rank=2.\n                  T2 = 1+4 = 5 -> remove 1 and 4, then the rest: [2] and [3] -> the pair (2,3)=5<=5 -> m=1, then R=0, then rank=1.\n                  T3 = 2+3 = 5 -> remove 2 and 3, then the rest: [1] and [4] -> the pair (1,4)=5<=5 -> m=1, R=0, rank=1.\n                  T4 = 2+4 = 6 -> remove 2 and 4, then the rest: [1] and [3] -> the pair (1,3)=4<6 -> m=1, R=0, rank=1.\n\n                Then the best rank is 1.\n\n                But note: we must choose a T>=x (which is 0) and then arrange the rest arbitrarily.\n\n                However, the above method requires iterating over all candidate T's (which are from 0 to 200000, and n up to 10^5) and for each candidate T, we have to remove one occurrence of a and b and then compute the maximum matching of pairs (from the remaining n-1) with total <= T. This is too expensive.\n\n            Alternative approach:\n\n            We can use the following known idea from problems like \"Assigning Partners\" or \"Matching with Constraints\".\n\n            We can precompute:\n\n              Sort A and B.\n\n            Then, we wish to compute for a fixed T (Vasya's total) and after removing one a and one b, the maximum number of pairs (from the remaining) with total <= T.\n\n            But note: we are allowed to remove any a and any b that sum to T (if multiple pairs sum to T, we can remove any one). However, we don't know which one to remove.\n\n            We can use a two-pointer method to count the maximum matching of pairs (a_i, b_j) with a_i+b_j <= T from the entire set. But then we have to account for the removal.\n\n            However, note: we are forming a complete matching (each a and b used once). The problem is similar to the classic problem: given two arrays A and B, and a limit T, how many pairs (a,b) can be formed such that a+b<=T? But note: we are forming a matching (bijection) and we wish to maximize the number of pairs <= T.\n\n            This is a standard problem: we can sort A and B, and then use two pointers. But the catch is: we are removing one a and one b.\n\n            Let me define:\n\n              Let f(T) = maximum number of pairs (from the entire set) that have total <= T (without removing anything). But then we remove one a and one b (which are part of the entire set). Then, the maximum number of pairs (from the remaining) that have total <= T might be affected.\n\n            But wait, we are not limited to the entire set: we are going to use all n-1 pairs. We wish to maximize the number of pairs with total <= T (from the remaining n-1 pairs). This is the same as: from the multiset A' (A without a0) and B' (B without b0), we wish to compute the maximum matching of pairs with total <= T.\n\n            However, we are allowed to choose which a and which b to remove (they must sum to T). So we wish to choose the removal that maximizes the number of pairs (from the rest) with total <= T.\n\n            This is getting very complicated.\n\n            Another idea: we can use the concept of \"two sets\" and matching. We can use a greedy matching: sort A and B. Then, to form as many pairs as possible with total <= T, we can match the smallest a with the largest b that is <= T - a, and so on.\n\n            But note: we are forming a complete matching (a bijection). The standard algorithm for the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) with a_i+b_j <= T is:\n\n              Sort A in increasing order, and B in increasing order.\n              Use two pointers: for each a_i (in increasing order), we find the largest b_j (from the beginning) such that a_i + b_j <= T. But wait, we want to maximize the number of pairs, so we should use the smallest b's for the smallest a's? Actually, no",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours and the given results of all participants. The key insight is that the pairing of first and second tour scores can be arbitrary, allowing us to optimize Vasya's rank by strategically assigning his scores and the rest of the participants' scores.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - Vasya must have a total score of at least `x` from his two tours.\n   - The ranking is determined by the sum of scores from both tours, with ties broken arbitrarily by the jury.\n   - We need to find the best (highest) and worst (lowest) rank Vasya can achieve by considering all possible valid pairings of scores.\n\n2. **Intuition**:\n   - **Best Rank**: To minimize Vasya's rank, assign him the highest possible total score (ensuring it's at least `x`) and arrange the remaining scores such that as few participants as possible have a higher or equal total.\n   - **Worst Rank**: To maximize Vasya's rank, assign him the lowest possible total score (still at least `x`) and arrange the remaining scores so that as many participants as possible have a higher total.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting and Two-Pointer Technique**: \n     - Sort both the first and second tour scores to efficiently compute the number of participants that can be ranked above or below Vasya.\n     - Use binary search to count participants who can outscore Vasya in the best case and underscore him in the worst case.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - Sorting the lists takes O(n log n) time.\n   - Binary searches for each participant take O(n log n) time in total.\n   - The overall complexity is O(n log n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b_list = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+2*n]))\n    \n    a_list.sort()\n    b_list.sort()\n    \n    best_rank = n\n    worst_rank = 1\n    \n    total = [(a + b) for a, b in zip(a_list, b_list)]\n    total.sort()\n    \n    idx = bisect.bisect_left(total, x)\n    if idx == n:\n        print(\"1 1\")\n        return\n        \n    best_candidate = total[idx]\n    worst_candidate = total[-1]\n    \n    A = a_list[:]\n    B = b_list[:]\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if A[i] + B[i] >= x:\n            break\n            \n    if A[i] + B[i] < x:\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            if A[j] + B[j] >= x:\n                i = j\n                break\n                \n    T_best = total[idx]\n    T_worst = total[-1]\n    \n    def count_greater_equal(T):\n        nonlocal A, B\n        A_sorted = sorted(A)\n        B_sorted = sorted(B)\n        count = 0\n        j = len(B_sorted) -
