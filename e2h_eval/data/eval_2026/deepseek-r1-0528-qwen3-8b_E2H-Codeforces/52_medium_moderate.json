Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of used candles needed to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have 'a' candles. Each candle burns for 1 hour and then becomes a used candle.\n   - We can take 'b' used candles and convert them into one new candle (which can then be burned).\n\n How the process goes?\n   - First, we burn as many new candles as we have. Let's say we start with 'a' candles.\n   - We burn all 'a' candles, which gives us 'a' hours of light and leaves us with 'a' used candles.\n   - Then, we can form floor(a / b) new candles from these used ones, and we are left with a % b used candles.\n\n But note: the new candles we form can also be burned and then become used again. So we can continue the process until we don't have enough used candles to form a new one.\n\n Steps:\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_candles = a\n   used_candles = 0\n\n However, we can simulate:\n\n   Step 1: Burn all current_candles (each gives 1 hour) -> total_hours += current_candles\n            Then we have current_candles used candles (from burning) and we might have leftover from previous steps.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think:\n\n   total_used = 0\n   total_new = a\n   hours = 0\n\n   But note: the problem is that we can use the same process repeatedly.\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n   hours = 0\n   candles = a\n   while candles >= b:\n        # Burn all candles (each candle burns for an hour, so we get 'candles' hours)\n        hours += candles\n        # Now, we have 'candles' used candles (because we burned them)\n        # Then we can make new_candles = candles // b\n        # And we leave remainder = candles % b\n        # Then we set candles to new_candles + remainder (because we can reuse the remainder with future new candles)\n\n   However, wait: after burning, we have 'candles' used candles. Then we make floor(candles / b) new candles and we are left with candles % b used candles (from the old ones). Then we add the new candles to the remaining used ones? Actually, we will have:\n\n        new_candles = candles // b\n        remaining_used = candles % b\n        Then we set candles = new_candles + remaining_used   [because the remaining_used are still there]\n\n   But then we burn these new_candles in the next iteration? Actually, we are burning the current set of candles, and then using the used ones to make more.\n\n   However, note: the process does not require that we wait until we have burned the entire set to start recycling. But the above while loop is standard.\n\n   Example: a=4, b=2\n\n        Iteration 1:\n            candles = 4\n            hours += 4 -> hours=4\n            new_candles = 4//2 = 2, remaining_used = 0\n            candles = 2 + 0 = 2\n\n        Iteration 2:\n            candles = 2\n            hours += 2 -> hours=6\n            new_candles = 2//2 = 1, remaining_used = 0\n            candles = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n        Iteration 3: 1 < 2 -> break.\n\n        But the example says 7 hours.\n\n   What's missing? \n\n   In the example, after burning the first 4, we get 4 used candles. Then we make 2 new candles (from 4 used) and burn them (which is 2 more hours). Then we have 2 used candles (from the two we just burned) and then we can make 1 new candle (using 2 used) and burn that (which is 1 more hour). Then we have 1 used candle (from the last burned candle) and that's not enough to make a new one (since we need 2). So total hours = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.\n\n   However, in our simulation above, we did:\n\n        Iteration1: hours=4, then we have 2 new candles and 0 remainder -> candles=2\n        Iteration2: burn 2 -> hours=6, then we have 2 used candles -> make 1 new candle (remainder 0) -> candles=1\n        Then stop.\n\n   We didn't account for the last burning of the last candle (the one made from the second batch) because we broke the loop when candles=1 (which is less than b=2). But note: we burned the 2 candles in the second iteration, then we made one from the 2 used, and then we have 1 candle to burn (the one we just made) but then we break because 1<2.\n\n   However, we did account for the burning of the 2 candles in the second iteration (which added 2 hours). Then we made a new candle from the 2 used, and then we have 1 candle (which we haven't burned yet). But wait: the process is that we burn the candles we have at the beginning of the hour. So we should burn the 2 candles (adding 2 hours) and then we have 2 used, then we make 1 new candle (so now we have 1 new candle and no old used). Then we can burn that one new candle (adding 1 hour) and then we have 1 used, which is not enough.\n\n   The problem is that our simulation only burns the candles at the beginning of the iteration. After making new candles, we don't automatically burn them in the same iteration. We only burn the candles we have at the start of the iteration.\n\n   Actually, let's reframe:\n\n   We have two types of candles: \n        - New candles (that we haven't burned yet) and \n        - Used candles (from previously burned candles)\n\n   But the problem states: initially, we have a candles (all new). Then we can use the used ones to make new ones.\n\n   However, the process described is:\n\n        1. Burn the available new candles (if any) for one hour per candle. Then they become used.\n        2. Then, we use the total used candles (from this burn and from previous leftovers) to make new candles.\n\n   But note: the problem doesn't specify the order of operations. However, the example does:\n\n        - First four hours: burn 4 candles (so 4 hours) and then we have 4 used.\n        - Then we make 2 new from 4 used (and then we have 0 leftover from the 4, but we have 2 new).\n        - Then we burn the 2 new candles (so 2 more hours) and then we have 2 used from those, and then we can make 1 new from 2 used, and then burn that (1 hour) and then we have 1 used (which isn't enough).\n\n   So the burning happens in batches: we burn all the candles we have (both the initial new and the ones we made from used) at the same time? Or we burn one hour at a time?\n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"Vasily lights up a new candle, it first burns for an hour and then goes out.\" And he can make b went out candles into a new candle.\n\n   This implies that we can only use the used candles (from the burned ones) to make new ones. So the process:\n\n        Hour 1: Use one new candle -> burns for 1 hour, becomes used. (We have a-1 new and 1 used)\n        But wait, if we do one by one, then we can't make multiple at once.\n\n   However, the problem says \"he acts optimally\", meaning he will use all the candles at once.\n\n   The key is: we can use all the available new candles (and then use the used ones from this burn to make more new ones, which then can be burned in the next cycle).\n\n   Actually, the problem is typically modeled as:\n\n        total_hours = 0\n        current = a\n        while current >= b:\n            # Burn all the current candles (current) -> each gives 1 hour, so we get current hours\n            total_hours += current\n            # Then, we have current used candles (from burning all)\n            # Now, we can form new_candles = current // b\n            # And we leave remainder = current % b\n            current = current // b + current % b\n\n   But wait, in the example: \n        a=4, b=2\n        total_hours=0, current=4\n        Iteration1: total_hours=4, current = 4//2 + 4%2 = 2+0 = 2\n        Iteration2: total_hours=6, current = 2//2 + 2%2 = 1+0 = 1 -> then stop.\n\n        Then we have 1 candle that we haven't burned? \n\n   But note: the above model burns the current set and then recycles. However, the 1 candle is not burned in the loop. \n\n   The issue: the loop condition is \"while current >= b\", meaning we break when current < b. Then we have current candles that are not burned because we don't have enough to recycle? \n\n   Actually, the 1 candle is still available and can be burned for one more hour. So we must account for the last burning.\n\n   Therefore, after the loop, we can burn the remaining 'current' candles (each for 1 hour). But wait, in the example, the remaining current is 1, so we can burn it for 1 hour.\n\n   Then total_hours becomes 4 + 2 + 1 + 1? No, because in the second iteration we burned 2 candles (so 2 hours) and then we made 1 candle from the 2 used, and then we burned that 1 candle (so 1 hour) and then we break. But the above code does not account for the last candle because the last candle was formed in the second iteration and then we break. However, we didn't burn the last candle in the loop.\n\n   Actually, let's break down:\n\n        We start with 4 candles (all new). We burn them (4 hours) and then we have 4 used, which forms 2 new candles (and 0 leftover). Then we burn these 2 (2 hours) and then we have 2 used, which forms 1 new (and 0 leftover). Then we break because 1 < 2.\n\n        But the last new candle (the one we made from the 2 used) is still available and hasn't been burned. So we should burn it.\n\n        However, note: the burning step is done at the beginning of the iteration. The above while loop does:\n\n            In the first iteration: we burn 4 (then we have 4 used -> form 2 new, so current becomes 2)\n            In the second iteration: we burn 2 (then we have 2 used -> form 1 new, so current becomes 1)\n\n        But wait, in the second iteration, we did burn 2, so that adds 2 hours. Then we form 1 new candle (from the 2 used) and then the loop ends because 1 < 2. However, we did not burn the last 1 candle.\n\n        How do we account for the last candle? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            total_hours = 0\n            current = a\n            while current >= b:\n                # Burn all the current candles (current) -> adds 'current' hours\n                total_hours += current\n                # Now, we have current used candles (from the current burn)\n                # Then, we form new_candles = current // b\n                # And we leave remainder = current % b\n                # Then, we set current to the new_candles plus the remainder (because we can combine with leftovers from before, but note: in the above model, we are effectively discarding the used candles from before? Actually, we are accumulating the used candles from the entire process.\n\n        However, in the above, the used candles from the previous cycles are being accounted for by the fact that we are setting current to the new_candles (which are made from the used) plus the remainder (which is the leftover from the current burn). But wait, how do we account for the used candles from previous burns? \n\n        Actually, the model is: we are allowed to use all the used candles (from all previous burns) to make new candles. But in the above, we are only using the current burn's used candles? \n\n        Let me clarify:\n\n        We start with a new candles. Then we burn them and get a used candles. Then we make floor(a/b) new candles and we are left with a % b used candles (from the initial burn). Then, we have floor(a/b) new candles and a % b used candles (which are the leftovers). Then we burn the new candles (floor(a/b)) and get floor(a/b) used candles, and then we combine the a % b and floor(a/b) used candles to make more.\n\n        But the above code does:\n\n            current = floor(a/b) + (a % b)\n\n        Then we burn these, and then we set current to floor( (floor(a/b)+ (a % b)) / b ) + ( (floor(a/b)+ (a % b)) % b )\n\n        However, that is not what the example does.\n\n        In the example, after the first burn (4 candles):\n\n            We have 4 used -> make 2 new and 0 leftover -> then we set current to 2 (which is the new candles). Then we burn these 2 and get 2 used, then we make 1 new and 0 leftover -> set current to 1.\n\n        But wait, what if we had leftovers from the first burn? The example has none. Now consider if we started with 5, b=2:\n\n            Initial: 5 new -> burn 5: hours=5, then we have 5 used -> make 2 new (5//2=2) and leftover 1 (5%2=1). Then we set current=2+1=3.\n\n            Then we burn 3: hours=5+3=8, then we have 3 used -> make 1 new (3//2=1) and leftover 1 (3%2=1). Then set current=1+1=2.\n\n            Then burn 2: hours=8+2=10, then we have 2 used -> make 1 new (2//2=1) and 0 leftover. Then set current=1.\n\n            Then burn 1: hours=10+1=11.\n\n        So we need to account for the last burning of the 1 candle.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            total_hours = 0\n            current = a\n            while current >= b:\n                total_hours += current\n                # Now, we have current used candles (from burning current candles)\n                # Then, we form new_candles = current // b\n                # And we leave remainder = current % b\n                # Then, current becomes new_candles + remainder (because we can use the remainder in the next cycle)\n                current = current // b + current % b\n\n            # Now, after the loop, we have current candles that are new (or available) and we can burn them (each gives 1 hour) without needing to recycle (since current < b)\n            total_hours += current\n\n        But wait, is that correct?\n\n        Example 1: a=4, b=2\n            Iteration1: current=4 -> total_hours=4, current = 4//2 + 4%2 = 2+0=2 -> then 2>=2 -> next iteration\n            Iteration2: current=2 -> total_hours=6, current = 2//2 + 2%2 = 1+0=1 -> then 1<2 -> break\n            Then add current: total_hours=7 -> correct.\n\n        Example 2: a=5, b=2\n            Iteration1: current=5 -> total_hours=5, current=5//2+5%2=2+1=3 -> 3>=2 -> next\n            Iteration2: current=3 -> total_hours=8, current=3//2+3%2=1+1=2 -> 2>=2 -> next\n            Iteration3: current=2 -> total_hours=10, current=2//2+2%2=1+0=1 -> 1<2 -> break\n            Then add current: total_hours=11 -> correct.\n\n        Example 3: a=6, b=3 (from the sample input, expected output 8)\n\n            Input: 6 3 -> expected output 8.\n\n            Iteration1: current=6 -> total_hours=6, current=6//3+6%3=2+0=2 -> 2<3 -> break\n            Then add current: 6+2=8 -> correct.\n\n        Example 4: a=1, b=2 -> \n            current=1 -> since 1<2, we break and then add 1 -> total_hours=1.\n\n        Example 5: a=3, b=2\n            Iteration1: current=3 -> total_hours=3, current=3//2+3%2=1+1=2 -> 2>=2 -> next\n            Iteration2: current=2 -> total_hours=5, current=2//2+2%2=1+0=1 -> break, then add 1 -> total_hours=6.\n\n        Let me verify with a=3, b=2 manually:\n\n            Start: 3 new candles.\n            Burn 3: 3 hours, then we have 3 used -> make floor(3/2)=1 new candle and leftover 1 used.\n            Now we have 1 new candle and 1 used (from the last burn) -> but wait, actually the process:\n\n            After burning the 3, we have 3 used. Then we make 1 new (using 2 of the used) and we are left with 1 used. Then we burn the 1 new candle: 1 hour (total 4) and then we have 1 used (from the new candle) and the previous 1 used -> total 2 used. Then we can make 1 new candle from the 2 used, burn it (1 hour, total 5) and then we have 1 used (from the last burn) -> cannot make more.\n\n            So total hours = 3 (first burn) + 1 (second burn) + 1 (third burn) = 5.\n\n            But our code gives 6.\n\n        What's the discrepancy?\n\n        Let me break down the code for a=3, b=2:\n\n            total_hours = 0\n            current = 3\n\n            Iteration1: \n                total_hours = 3\n                current = 3//2 + 3%2 = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n            Then we enter the loop again because 2>=2.\n            Iteration2:\n                total_hours = 3+2 = 5\n                current = 2//2 + 2%2 = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n            Then we break and add 1 -> total_hours=6.\n\n        But according to manual calculation, we should have 5.\n\n        Why the difference?\n\n        The model in the code:\n\n            In the first iteration: \n                We burn 3 candles (3 hours) and then we have 3 used, which we convert to 1 new and leave 1 used. Then we set current to 2 (which is the 1 new and the 1 leftover used? But note: the leftover used is not a new candle, it's just a used candle. However, in the next iteration, we are going to burn the current set (which is 2). But wait, the 2 is not entirely new candles? \n\n        The problem: the process allows you to use the used candles (leftover) to make more candles, but in the next iteration, we are treating the leftover as if they are available to burn (along with the new ones). However, in reality, the leftover used candles are not burned until they are part of a recycled candle? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not require that we burn the leftover used candles separately. We only burn the new candles (or the ones we made) and then we use all the used candles (from the current burn and from leftovers) to make new ones.\n\n        But in the code, we are effectively treating the leftover used candles as if they are new candles? \n\n        Let me explain:\n\n            The process is:\n\n                We have some candles (both new and recycled) that we burn. Then we count the used candles from all the burning (both the ones that were new and the ones that were recycled? Actually, no: the recycled ones were made from used candles, but when we burn them, they become used again.\n\n            However, the key is: when we burn a candle, regardless of whether it was new or recycled, it becomes used. Then we combine all used candles (from every burn) to make new ones.\n\n        The code is actually:\n\n            total_hours += current   [this accounts for burning 'current' candles, which are either new or recycled]\n            Then, we form new candles from all the used candles that we just created (from burning these 'current' candles) plus any leftover from previous cycles? \n\n        But wait, the variable 'current' is set to the number of new candles we can make (from the used candles we just got) plus the leftover used candles from the same burn. Then in the next iteration, we are burning that entire set (which includes both new candles and leftover used candles). \n\n        However, the leftover used candles from the previous burn are not accounted for in the same way. \n\n        Let's try to model with two sets:\n\n            Let:\n                new = the number of new candles (that we haven't burned and that were either initially given or made from used)\n                used = the number of used candles (from previous burns)\n\n            Initially: new = a, used = 0.\n\n            Then, we burn all new candles: \n                hours += new\n                used += new   [because each new candle becomes used]\n                Then, we can make new_candles = used // b\n                Then, we update: new = new_candles, and used = used % b\n\n            Then we repeat.\n\n            Example a=3, b=2:\n\n                new=3, used=0\n                Burn: hours=3, used=3\n                Make new_candles = 3//2 = 1, so new=1, used=3%2=1\n\n                Then, we have new=1, used=1.\n\n                Now, we burn the new=1: \n                    hours=3+1=4\n                    used=1+1=2\n                Then, make new_candles=2//2=1, so new=1, used=0.\n\n                Then, burn the new=1:\n                    hours=4+1=5\n                    used=1\n                Then, make new_candles=1//2=0, so new=0, used=1 -> break.\n\n                Total hours=5.\n\n            This matches the manual calculation.\n\n        So the code should be:\n\n            total_hours = 0\n            new = a\n            used = 0\n\n            while new > 0:\n                # Burn all new candles\n                total_hours += new\n                # These new candles become used\n                used += new\n                # Now, we can make new candles from the used ones\n                # Let's calculate how many new candles we can make and the leftover used\n                new_candles = used // b\n                used = used % b\n                new = new_candles\n\n            Then print(total_hours)\n\n        But wait, in the above, we burn the new candles and then we update the used and then we update new. However, note that the used candles from the previous burn are already included.\n\n        However, let's test with a=4, b=2:\n\n            new=4, used=0\n            Iteration1:\n                total_hours=4\n                used=4\n                new_candles=4//2=2, used=0, new=2\n            Iteration2:\n                total_hours=6\n                used=2\n                new_candles=2//2=1, used=0, new=1\n            Iteration3:\n                total_hours=7\n                used=1\n                new_candles=1//2=0, used=1, new=0 -> break.\n\n            Output=7 -> correct.\n\n        Example a=5, b=2:\n\n            new=5, used=0\n            Iteration1:\n                total_hours=5\n                used=5\n                new_candles=5//2=2, used=1, new=2\n            Iteration2:\n                total_hours=7\n                used=2+1=3 -> wait, no: we are adding the new candles to used? Actually, in the above code, we are doing:\n\n                We start with used=1 (from the previous iteration) and then we burn the new=2, so we add 2 to used -> used=1+2=3.\n\n                Then, new_candles=3//2=1, used=3%2=1, new=1\n            Iteration3:\n                total_hours=8\n                used=1+1=2\n                new_candles=2//2=1, used=0, new=1\n            Iteration4:\n                total_hours=9\n                used=1\n                new_candles=1//2=0, used=1, new=0 -> break.\n\n            Total_hours=9, but expected was 11 from the previous calculation.\n\n        Wait, what? There's a discrepancy. \n\n        Let me recalc manually for a=5, b=2:\n\n            Start: 5 new\n            Burn 5: 5 hours -> used=5\n            Make 5//2=2 new and leftover 1 -> now we have 2 new and 1 used (from the first burn)\n\n            Then, we burn the 2 new: 2 hours (total=7) -> used becomes 1 (leftover) + 2 = 3\n            Then, make 3//2=1 new and leftover 1 -> now we have 1 new and 1 used (from the second burn)\n\n            Then, burn the 1 new: 1 hour (total=8) -> used becomes 1 (from the third burn) + 1 = 2\n            Then, make 2//2=1 new and leftover 0 -> now we have 1 new and 0 used.\n\n            Then, burn the 1 new: 1 hour (total=9) -> used becomes 1\n            Then, make 0 new -> stop.\n\n            So total=9.\n\n        But earlier I thought the answer for a=5, b=2 was 11. That was incorrect.\n\n        Let me check with the example from the problem statement: \n            Input: ['6 3'] -> output 8.\n\n            Using the manual method for a=6, b=3:\n\n                Start: 6 new\n                Burn 6: 6 hours -> used=6\n                Make 6//3=2 new, leftover 0 -> now we have 2 new and 0 used.\n\n                Then, burn 2: 2 hours (total=8) -> used=2\n                Make 2//3=0 new -> stop.\n\n                So total=8.\n\n            Now, why did I think it was 11 for a=5, b=2? \n\n            Actually, I think I did a mistake in the first example with a=5, b=2: \n\n            I said:\n\n                Iteration1: current=5 -> total_hours=5, current=5//2+5%2=2+1=3 -> then 3>=2 -> next\n                Iteration2: current=3 -> total_hours=8, current=3//2+3%2=1+1=2 -> 2>=2 -> next\n                Iteration3: current=2 -> total_hours=10, current=2//2+2%2=1+0=1 -> break, then add 1 -> total_hours=11.\n\n            But wait, the code I wrote earlier for the first version was:\n\n                total_hours = 0\n                current = a\n                while current >= b:\n                    total_hours += current\n                    current = current // b + current % b\n                total_hours += current\n\n            For a=5, b=2:\n\n                Iteration1: current=5 -> total_hours=5, current = 5//2+5%2 = 2+1=3\n                Iteration2: current=3 -> total_hours=8, current = 3//2+3%2 = 1+1=2\n                Iteration3: current=2 -> total_hours=10, current = 2//2+2%2 = 1+0=1 -> then break, then add 1 -> 11.\n\n            But the correct total should be 9.\n\n            Why did the manual calculation for the second method (with two variables) give 9?\n\n            The first method (the one with current) is actually:\n\n                We are burning 'current' candles (which are the new ones) and then we are using the used from these burns (which are 'current') to make new ones, and then we are combining the new ones with the remainder (which is the leftover from the division). However, in the second method, we are accounting for the used candles from previous burns separately.\n\n            The issue in the first method is: \n\n                In the first iteration, we burn 5 new candles and get 5 used. Then we make 2 new candles and leave 1 used. Then we set current to 3 (which is 2 new and 1 used). Then we burn 3 candles (but wait, the 3 candles are: 2 new and 1 used? But the problem says we can only burn new candles? \n\n            Actually, the problem states: \"Vasily lights up a new candle\". It doesn't say he can light up used ones. \n\n            Rereading: \"When Vasily lights up a new candle, it first burns for an hour and then it goes out.\" \n\n            And then: \"he can make b went out candles into a new candle.\"\n\n            So he can only light up new candles. The used candles are not directly burnable; they must be recycled.\n\n            Therefore, the process is:\n\n                We start with 'a' new candles.\n\n                We can burn all the new candles we have (at any time). Then we get used candles. Then we can recycle the used candles to make new ones.\n\n                We cannot burn the used candles directly.\n\n            So the first method is incorrect because it burns the leftover used candles (by including them in 'current').\n\n            The second method (with separate new and used) is the correct one.\n\n        Therefore, the solution is:\n\n            total_hours = 0\n            new = a\n            used = 0\n\n            while new > 0:\n                # Burn all the new candles\n                total_hours += new\n                # These new candles become used\n                used += new\n                # Now, we can make new candles from the used ones\n                new = used // b\n                used = used % b\n\n            Then output total_hours.\n\n        Let me test with the examples:\n\n        Example 1: a=4, b=2\n            new=4, used=0\n            Iteration1: \n                total_hours=4\n                used=4\n                new=4//2=2, used=0\n            Iteration2:\n                total_hours=6\n                used=2\n                new=2//2=1, used=0\n            Iteration3:\n                total_hours=7\n                used=1\n                new=1//2=0, used=1 -> break.\n\n            Output=7 -> correct.\n\n        Example 2: a=6, b=3\n            new=6, used=0\n            Iteration1:\n                total_hours=6\n                used=6\n                new=6//3=2, used=0\n            Iteration2:\n                total_hours=8\n                used=2\n                new=2//3=0, used=2 -> break.\n\n            Output=8 -> correct.\n\n        Example 3: a=5, b=2\n            new=5, used=0\n            Iteration1:\n                total_hours=5\n                used=5\n                new=5//2=2, used=1\n            Iteration2:\n                total_hours=7\n                used=2+1=3   [Wait, no: in the second method, we don't add the new to used? Actually, the new is burned and becomes used, so we should add the new (which is 2) to the existing used (which is 1). \n\n            Correction: in the second method, we do:\n\n                used += new   [which is 2] -> so used becomes 1+2=3\n\n            Then, new = 3//2=1, used=3%2=1.\n\n            Iteration3:\n                total_hours=8\n                used=1+1=2\n                new=2//2=1, used=0\n            Iteration4:\n                total_hours=9\n                used=1\n                new=1//2=0, used=1 -> break.\n\n            Output=9.\n\n        Example 4: a=1, b=2\n            new=1, used=0\n            Iteration1:\n                total_hours=1\n                used=1\n                new=1//2=0, used=1 -> break.\n\n            Output=1.\n\n        Example 5: a=3, b=2\n            new=3, used=0\n            Iteration1:\n                total_hours=3\n                used=3\n                new=3//2=1, used=1\n            Iteration2:\n                total_hours=4\n                used=1+1=2   [because we burned 1 new candle, so we add 1 to used -> 1+1=2]\n                new=2//2=1, used=0\n            Iteration3:\n                total_hours=5\n                used=1\n                new=1//2=0, used=1 -> break.\n\n            Output=5.\n\n        This matches the manual calculation.\n\n        However, note: in the second iteration, we are burning 1 new candle (which we made from the first burn) and then we update used by adding 1 (the new candle becomes used). \n\n        So the code is:\n\n            a, b = map(int, input().split())\n            total = 0\n            new = a\n            used = 0\n\n            while new > 0:\n                total += new\n                used += new\n                new = used // b\n                used = used % b\n\n            print(total)\n\n        But wait, is there a possibility that we can run into an infinite loop? \n\n        Since 'used' is updated by adding 'new' and then divided by b, and b>=2, the value of 'used' will eventually become small enough that new becomes 0.\n\n        Let me test with a very large a and b=2.\n\n        However, note: the problem constraints are small (a, b between 1 and 1000). So we don't need to worry about performance.\n\n        But let me see: \n\n            In the worst-case scenario, a=1000, b=2:\n\n            Iteration1: new=1000, used=1000 -> new=500, used=0\n            Iteration2: new=500, used=500 -> new=250, used=0\n            Iteration3: new=250, used=250 -> new=125, used=0\n            ... until new becomes 0.\n\n            This is logarithmic (base b) in a, so it's efficient.\n\n        Therefore, we can write the code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the above code uses integer division and modulus, which is standard.\n\n        Let me run the provided examples:\n\n            Input: \"4 2\" -> Output: 7\n            Input: \"6 3\" -> Output: 8\n\n        The example input is given as:\n\n            Input: ['4 2', '6 3']\n\n        But the problem says: \"The single line contains two integers, a and b\"\n\n        So we read one line.\n\n        Code:\n\n            data = input().split()\n            if not data:\n                # But the problem says there are two integers, so normally we don't need this, but for safety\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                a = int(data[0])\n                b = int(data[1])\n                total = 0\n                new = a\n                used = 0\n                while new > 0:\n                    total += new\n                    used += new\n                    new = used // b\n                    used = used % b\n                print(total)\n\n        This should work.\n\n        Let me test with the provided examples and edge cases.\n\n        Edge case: a=0 -> then we break and print 0.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The key observation here is that each candle burns for one hour and then becomes a used candle. Vasily can then recycle `b` used candles to create a new one. The challenge is to simulate this process efficiently to calculate the total burning time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with `a` new candles and zero used candles.\n2. **Burning Candles**: For each iteration, burn all available new candles. Each burned candle contributes one hour to the total time and becomes a used candle.\n3. **Recycling Used Candles**: After burning, convert the used candles into new ones. The number of new candles is the integer division of the total used candles by `b`, and the remainder becomes leftover used candles.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until there are no new candles left to burn. The total time accumulated during each burning phase gives the answer.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the process of burning and recycling candles, ensuring optimal usage to maximize the total burning time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    total = 0\n    new = a\n    used = 0\n    while new > 0:\n        total += new\n        used += new\n        new = used // b\n        used = used % b\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads two integers, `a` (initial number of candles) and `b` (number of used candles needed to make a new one).\n2. **Initialization**: Variables `total` (accumulated hours), `new` (current new candles), and `used` (current used candles) are initialized.\n3. **Loop**: The loop runs as long as there are new candles to burn:\n   - **Burning Phase**: The number of new candles is added to `total` (each represents one hour of light). These candles are then converted to used candles.\n   - **Recycling Phase**: The used candles are divided by `b` to determine how many new candles can be made. The remainder from this division remains as unused used candles.\n4. **Output**: After the loop terminates, the total accumulated hours is printed, representing the maximum time the room can be lit.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem by leveraging simple arithmetic operations within a loop, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
