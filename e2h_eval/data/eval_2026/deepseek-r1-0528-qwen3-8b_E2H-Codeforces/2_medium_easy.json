Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, and then n lines of n characters each.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. All the letters on both diagonals must be the same (but note: the center is shared by both diagonals).\n 2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must be the same letter and different from the diagonal letter.\n\n However, note that the example: \n   Input: 3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw -> Output: YES\n   But: \n        w s w\n        s w s\n        w s w\n\n Here, the diagonals have 'w' (from top-left to bottom-right: w, w, w; and the other diagonal: w, w, w) and the rest are 's'. So it's valid.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read n.\n 2. Read the grid.\n\n 3. Check the two diagonals:\n    - Main diagonal: (i, i) for i in range(n)\n    - Anti-diagonal: (i, n-1-i) for i in range(n)\n\n 4. Let the common letter on the main diagonal be `diag_letter1` and on the anti-diagonal be `diag_letter2`.\n    But note: the center is (n//2) and is common to both. So if the center is included, then we expect that the entire main diagonal and anti-diagonal are the same letter? Actually, the problem says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". So both diagonals must have the same letter? Or can they be two different letters?\n\n Let me check with example: \n   Example 1: \n      5\n      xooox\n      oxoxo\n      soxoo\n      oxoxo\n      xooox\n\n   The main diagonal: \n        row0: 'x'\n        row1: 'o'\n        row2: 's'\n        row3: 'o'\n        row4: 'x'\n\n   That's not the same. So wait, the example input is given as:\n\n      ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', ...]\n\n   And expected output is \"NO\".\n\n   But in the example, the diagonals are not the same? Actually, let's look at the example:\n\n   The example has:\n        x o o o x\n        o x o x o\n        s o x o o\n        o x o x o\n        x o o o x\n\n   The main diagonal: \n        (0,0): 'x'\n        (1,1): 'x'\n        (2,2): 'x'\n        (3,3): 'x'\n        (4,4): 'x'\n\n   Wait, actually the example input string is:\n\n        '5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox'\n\n   So the third row is 'soxoo', meaning at (2,2) we have 'x'? Actually no: \n        row0: index0: 'x', index4: 'x'\n        row1: index1: 'x' (because \"oxoxo\" -> index1 is 'x')? Actually, let me break down:\n\n        Row0: \"xooox\" -> [0,0]='x', [0,1]='o', [0,2]='o', [0,3]='o', [0,4]='x'\n        Row1: \"oxoxo\" -> [1,0]='o', [1,1]='x', [1,2]='o', [1,3]='x', [1,4]='o'\n        Row2: \"soxoo\" -> [2,0]='s', [2,1]='o', [2,2]='x', [2,3]='o', [2,4]='o'\n        Row3: \"oxoxo\" -> same as row1\n        Row4: \"xooox\"\n\n   Now, main diagonal: \n        (0,0): 'x'\n        (1,1): 'x'\n        (2,2): 'x'\n        (3,3): 'x'\n        (4,4): 'x'\n\n   Anti-diagonal:\n        (0,4): 'x'\n        (1,3): 'x'\n        (2,2): 'x'\n        (3,1): 'x'\n        (4,0): 'x'\n\n   So both diagonals are 'x'. Then what is the problem? \n\n   The condition also says: \"all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\n   In this example, the non-diagonal squares: \n        We have to check every cell that is not on the main diagonal or anti-diagonal.\n\n   How many cells are on the diagonals? There are 2*n - 1 cells (since the center is counted once). The total cells are n*n, so the rest are n*n - (2*n - 1).\n\n   Now, in the example, the non-diagonal cells are:\n\n        Row0: [0,1], [0,2], [0,3] -> 'o','o','o'\n        Row1: [1,0], [1,2], [1,4] -> 'o','o','o'\n        Row2: [2,0], [2,1], [2,3], [2,4] -> 's','o','o','o'\n        Row3: [3,0], [3,2], [3,4] -> 'o','o','o'\n        Row4: [4,1], [4,2], [4,3] -> 'o','o','o'\n\n   So the non-diagonal cells have two types: \n        In row0, row1, row3, row4: they are all 'o'\n        In row2: [2,0] is 's', and the others are 'o'\n\n   Therefore, the non-diagonal cells are not the same letter. Because we have both 'o' and 's'. \n\n   But wait, the example output is \"NO\", which matches.\n\n   Another example: \n        Input: 3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\n\n        Grid:\n            w s w\n            s w s\n            w s w\n\n        Diagonals: \n            Main: [0,0]='w', [1,1]='w', [2,2]='w'\n            Anti: [0,2]='w', [1,1]='w', [2,0]='w'\n\n        Non-diagonal cells: \n            row0: [0,1] = 's'\n            row1: [1,0] = 's', [1,2] = 's'\n            row2: [2,1] = 's'\n\n        So the non-diagonal cells are all 's', which is different from 'w'. So that's valid.\n\n   However, what if the two diagonals have two different letters?\n        Example: \n          n=3\n          a b c\n          d e f\n          g h i\n\n        If we set:\n          a=e=i=c=g (so main diagonal is one letter) and anti-diagonal is another letter (say, k) for the three anti-diagonal elements.\n\n        Condition says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". So the main diagonal must be same, and the anti-diagonal must be same. But note: the center is in both, so the center must be the same for both diagonals. Therefore, the two diagonals must have the same letter? \n\n        Actually, the center is part of both. So if the main diagonal is letter A and the anti-diagonal is letter B, then the center must be both A and B. Hence, A must equal B.\n\n        Therefore, the entire main diagonal and anti-diagonal must be the same letter.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n        Step 1: Check that the main diagonal and anti-diagonal have the same letter throughout, and that letter is the same for the entire diagonal (including the center).\n\n        Step 2: Check that every cell not on the diagonals is the same letter (say, B) and that B != the diagonal letter.\n\n Implementation:\n\n        Let diag_letter = None\n\n        For i in range(n):\n            j = i\n            if grid[i][j] != grid[0][0]:\n                Then if we haven't set diag_letter, set it to grid[0][0] and then check the rest? Alternatively, we can iterate and see if all the main diagonal are the same.\n\n        Alternatively, we can collect the entire main diagonal and entire anti-diagonal.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        1. Read n and grid.\n\n        2. Create two sets (or just check) for the diagonals:\n\n           main_diag = set()\n           anti_diag = set()\n\n           for i in range(n):\n               main_diag.add(grid[i][i])\n               anti_diag.add(grid[i][n-1-i])\n\n           Then the entire main diagonal must be the same, so len(main_diag) == 1, and similarly for anti_diag.\n\n           But note: the center is the same for both, so if the main_diag has one element and anti_diag has one element, then they must be the same? Actually, because the center is in both, the element at the center must be in both sets. Therefore, the two sets must be the same? \n\n           However, we can do:\n\n           diag_letter = grid[0][0]\n           for i in range(n):\n               if grid[i][i] != diag_letter:\n                   print(\"NO\")\n                   exit(0)\n           # Then check anti-diagonal: but note the center is already checked, so we can start from i=0 and go to n-1, but we know the center is the same.\n\n           Alternatively, we can check the entire main diagonal and entire anti-diagonal separately, and then ensure that the letter for the main diagonal is the same as the anti-diagonal.\n\n           But note: if the main diagonal is all 'x' and anti-diagonal is all 'y', then at the center (which is the middle) we have two conditions: grid[n//2][n//2] must be both 'x' and 'y'. So unless x==y, we have a contradiction.\n\n           So we can:\n\n           Step 1: Check that the entire main diagonal is the same letter, say A.\n           Step 2: Check that the entire anti-diagonal is the same letter, say B.\n           Step 3: If A != B, then NO.\n\n           However, step 3 is redundant because the center is in both, so if the main diagonal is A and the anti-diagonal is B, then at the center we must have A and B, so A must equal B. Therefore, we only need to check that the entire main diagonal is the same and the entire anti-diagonal is the same (and then automatically the center is consistent). \n\n           But wait: what if the main diagonal is all 'x' and the anti-diagonal is all 'x' (so same) then okay. What if the main diagonal is all 'x' and the anti-diagonal is all 'x' too? Then center is 'x' for both.\n\n           Alternatively, we can check the entire main diagonal and entire anti-diagonal without assuming the center: \n\n           Actually, we can check:\n\n           for i in range(n):\n               if grid[i][i] != grid[0][0]:\n                   return \"NO\"\n           for i in range(n):\n               if grid[i][n-1-i] != grid[0][n-1]:\n                   return \"NO\"\n\n           But wait, what if the anti-diagonal has a different starting point? Actually, the anti-diagonal's first element is grid[0][n-1]. We require that the entire anti-diagonal is the same as grid[0][n-1]. But note: the center must be grid[0][0] for the main diagonal and grid[0][n-1] for the anti-diagonal, so unless grid[0][0] == grid[0][n-1] we have a problem? \n\n           However, consider: the center is the same for both diagonals. So grid[n//2][n//2] must equal grid[0][0] (from main diagonal) and grid[n//2][n//2] must equal grid[0][n-1] (from anti-diagonal). Therefore, we must have grid[0][0] == grid[0][n-1].\n\n           So if grid[0][0] != grid[0][n-1], then the two diagonals cannot have the same letter at the center. Therefore, we can check:\n\n           if grid[0][0] != grid[0][n-1]:\n               print(\"NO\")\n               return\n\n           Then we can check the entire main diagonal and entire anti-diagonal.\n\n           However, the problem does not require that the main diagonal and anti-diagonal use the same letter as the outer condition? Actually, the condition says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". It doesn't say they must be the same as each other? But wait, the center is shared, so the two diagonals must have the same letter at the center. Therefore, the entire main diagonal must be one letter (say A) and the entire anti-diagonal must be one letter (say B), and since the center is A and B, then A must equal B.\n\n           So the entire main diagonal and anti-diagonal must be the same letter? Actually, no: the entire main diagonal must be the same letter (call it A) and the entire anti-diagonal must be the same letter (call it B). Then the center being the same element requires A=B. So we can simply check:\n\n           Let A = grid[0][0]\n           Check that for all i: grid[i][i] == A\n           Check that for all i: grid[i][n-1-i] == A\n\n           Then we have consistency.\n\n           But wait, is that sufficient? \n\n           Example: \n                n=3\n                aaa\n                aaa\n                aaa\n\n           Then main diagonal: [0][0]='a', [1][1]='a', [2][2]='a' -> okay.\n           Anti-diagonal: [0][2]='a', [1][1]='a', [2][0]='a' -> okay.\n\n           Now, the non-diagonal cells: \n                [0][1] = 'a', [1][0]='a', [1][2]='a', [2][1]='a'\n\n           But the condition also says: the other squares must be the same letter and different from the diagonal letter. In this case, the non-diagonal cells are 'a', which is the same as the diagonal letter. So this fails.\n\n           Therefore, we must check that the non-diagonal cells are the same letter (say B) and B != A.\n\n           Steps:\n\n           1. Check that all the main diagonal is A (same letter) and all the anti-diagonal is A (same letter). This implies the center is A and the entire diagonals are A.\n\n           2. Check that all the non-diagonal cells are the same letter (say B) and that B != A.\n\n           However, note: the non-diagonal cells must be the same letter. So we can:\n\n           - Traverse the grid and for every cell that is not on the main diagonal and not on the anti-diagonal, check that it is the same letter.\n\n           But note: the diagonals have 2*n - 1 cells. The total grid has n*n cells.\n\n           We can do:\n\n           diag_set = set()\n           for i in range(n):\n               diag_set.add(grid[i][i])\n               diag_set.add(grid[i][n-1-i])\n\n           Then the entire diagonal is one letter: A = diag_set.pop() (if there is only one element). But wait, we know the diagonals are uniform, so diag_set should have one element.\n\n           Then, for every cell (i, j) that is not on either diagonal, we want to check:\n\n           - They are the same letter (so we can take the first non-diagonal cell and then check the rest are that letter) and that letter is not A.\n\n           However, note: the problem does not specify that the non-diagonal letter is unique? Actually, the condition says: \"all other squares ... contain the same letter\". So they must all be the same.\n\n           So:\n\n           Step 1: Check the diagonals are uniform and the same (so the entire main and anti-diagonal are the same letter, say A).\n\n           Step 2: Check that every non-diagonal cell is the same letter (say B) and B != A.\n\n           But wait, what if there are multiple non-diagonal letters? \n\n           Example: \n                n=3\n                x . x\n                . x .\n                x . x\n\n           But then if we put two different non-diagonal letters, then it fails.\n\n           So:\n\n           Let A = grid[0][0] (we assume the entire diagonal is A, so we have to check that)\n\n           How to check the entire diagonal?\n\n           We can do:\n\n           # Check main diagonal\n           for i in range(n):\n               if grid[i][i] != A:\n                   print(\"NO\")\n                   return\n\n           # Check anti-diagonal\n           for i in range(n):\n               if grid[i][n-1-i] != A:\n                   print(\"NO\")\n                   return\n\n           Then, we need to check the rest.\n\n           We can create a set of non-diagonal letters.\n\n           But note: we don't know what the non-diagonal letter is. We can pick the first non-diagonal cell and then check the rest.\n\n           Alternatively, we can:\n\n           base_letter = None\n           for i in range(n):\n               for j in range(n):\n                   if i == j or i+j == n-1:  # skip diagonal\n                       continue\n                   if base_letter is None:\n                       base_letter = grid[i][j]\n                   else:\n                       if grid[i][j] != base_letter:\n                           print(\"NO\")\n                           return\n           # Then check that base_letter is not A.\n\n           However, what if the grid is 3x3 and the non-diagonal cells are empty? Then base_letter would be None? Then we skip. We must ensure there is at least one non-diagonal cell.\n\n           Since n>=3 and odd, the number of non-diagonal cells is n*n - (2*n-1) which is positive (for n>=3: 9-5=4, which is positive).\n\n           But note: if n=3, then 9 - 5 = 4 non-diagonal cells.\n\n           However, there is a catch: what if the entire grid is the same letter? Then the non-diagonal cells are A, which is the same as the diagonal. Then we would set base_letter to A (from the first non-diagonal cell) and then check the rest are A, and then we check base_letter != A -> fails.\n\n           So we must first check the diagonals, then check the non-diagonal cells are the same and different.\n\n           But note: the problem says \"all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals\". \n\n           So the non-diagonal letter must be different from A.\n\n           Therefore, after collecting base_letter from the non-diagonal cells, we must check base_letter != A.\n\n           However, what if there is a mix of non-diagonal cells? We are checking that all non-diagonal cells are the same, and that same letter is not A.\n\n           But wait, what if the non-diagonal cells are not uniform? Then we break early.\n\n           Code structure:\n\n           n = int(input().strip())\n           grid = []\n           for i in range(n):\n               grid.append(input().strip())\n\n           # Step 1: Check the diagonals\n           A = grid[0][0]   # the candidate for diagonal letter\n\n           # Check main diagonal\n           for i in range(n):\n               if grid[i][i] != A:\n                   print(\"NO\")\n                   exit(0)\n\n           # Check anti-diagonal\n           for i in range(n):\n               if grid[i][n-1-i] != A:\n                   print(\"NO\")\n                   exit(0)\n\n           # Now, check the non-diagonal cells\n           base_letter = None\n           for i in range(n):\n               for j in range(n):\n                   if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                       continue   # skip diagonal\n                   if base_letter is None:\n                       base_letter = grid[i][j]\n                   else:\n                       if grid[i][j] != base_letter:\n                           print(\"NO\")\n                           exit(0)\n\n           # Now, if we found at least one non-diagonal cell, then base_letter is set. Otherwise, if there are no non-diagonal cells? (n>=3, so there are non-diagonal cells) then we can proceed.\n           if base_letter is None:\n               # This means there are no non-diagonal cells? But n>=3 and odd, so there should be some. However, if n==1, but n>=3, so we don't worry.\n               print(\"NO\")\n               exit(0)\n\n           if base_letter == A:\n               print(\"NO\")\n               exit(0)\n\n           print(\"YES\")\n\n           However, wait: what if the grid has non-diagonal cells that are all the same but that same letter is A? Then we fail.\n\n           But note: we already checked that the non-diagonal cells are all the same (base_letter) and then we check that base_letter != A.\n\n           But what if the grid is:\n\n                n=3\n                x y x\n                y x y\n                x y x\n\n           Then the diagonals are 'x' (A='x'), and the non-diagonal cells are all 'y'. So base_letter='y' and then we check 'y' != 'x' -> YES.\n\n           Another example:\n\n                n=3\n                a b c\n                d e f\n                g h i\n\n           We set A = grid[0][0] = 'a'\n\n           Check main diagonal: [a, e, i] -> must be 'a'. So if e is not 'a' or i is not 'a', then NO.\n\n           Similarly, anti-diagonal: [c, e, g] -> must be 'a'.\n\n           Then, non-diagonal cells: [b, d, f, h] -> must be the same letter and not 'a'.\n\n           But if the main diagonal is 'a' and anti-diagonal is 'a', then we require:\n\n                a e i are 'a'\n                c e g are 'a'\n\n           Then the grid must be:\n\n                a b c\n                d a f\n                g h a\n\n           and also c, g are 'a', so:\n\n                a b a\n                d a f\n                a h a\n\n           Then the non-diagonal cells: \n                row0: [0,1] -> 'b'\n                row1: [1,0] -> 'd', [1,2] -> 'f'\n                row2: [2,1] -> 'h'\n\n           Now, these must be the same letter. So 'b', 'd', 'f', 'h' must be the same. And that same letter must not be 'a'.\n\n           Example: \n                a b b\n                b a b\n                b b a\n\n           Then the non-diagonal cells are all 'b', which is different from 'a'. So YES.\n\n           But wait, the example input:\n\n                3\n                xpx\n                pxp\n                xpe\n\n           Expected output: \"NO\"\n\n           Let's check with our code:\n\n                n=3\n                grid = [\n                    \"xpx\",\n                    \"pxp\",\n                    \"xpe\"\n                ]\n\n           Step 1: A = grid[0][0] = 'x'\n\n           Check main diagonal: \n                [0][0]:'x' -> ok\n                [1][1]:'x' (from \"pxp\": the middle is 'x') -> wait, the second row is \"pxp\", so [1][1] is 'x'? \n                [2][2]:'e' -> 'e' != 'x' -> NO.\n\n           So we output \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n           However, note the example input was:\n\n                ['3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n           And the example output was \"NO\".\n\n           But wait, the example input provided in the problem is:\n\n                ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n           And outputs: ['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\n           Our code:\n\n           Example1: \n                n=5, grid as given -> we check the main diagonal: \n                    row0: 'x'\n                    row1: 'o' -> wait, the example grid row1 is \"oxoxo\", so [1][1] is 'x'? Actually, wait:\n\n                    The grid is:\n\n                        0: xooox -> [0][0]='x', [0][1]='o', [0][2]='o', [0][3]='o', [0][4]='x'\n                        1: oxoxo -> [1][0]='o', [1][1]='x', [1][2]='o', [1][3]='x', [1][4]='o'\n                        2: soxoo -> [2][0]='s', [2][1]='o', [2][2]='x', [2][3]='o', [2][4]='o'\n                        3: oxoxo -> same as row1\n                        4: xooox\n\n                Main diagonal: \n                    row0: 'x'\n                    row1: [1][1] = 'x' -> ok\n                    row2: [2][2] = 'x' -> ok\n                    row3: [3][3] = 'x' -> ok\n                    row4: [4][4] = 'x' -> ok\n\n                Anti-diagonal:\n                    row0: [0][4] = 'x' -> ok\n                    row1: [1][3] = 'x' -> ok\n                    row2: [2][2] = 'x' -> ok\n                    row3: [3][1] = 'x' (from row3: oxoxo -> [3][1] is 'x') -> ok\n                    row4: [4][0] = 'x' -> ok\n\n                Then we check non-diagonal cells:\n\n                We'll traverse:\n\n                row0: [0,1], [0,2], [0,3] -> 'o','o','o'\n                row1: [1,0], [1,2], [1,4] -> 'o','o','o'\n                row2: [2,0], [2,1], [2,3], [2,4] -> 's','o','o','o'\n                row3: [3,0], [3,2], [3,4] -> 'o','o','o'\n                row4: [4,1], [4,2], [4,3] -> 'o','o','o'\n\n                The non-diagonal cells are not all the same: we have 'o' and 's'. So when we hit row2, column0: 's' (which is not 'o') -> we break and say \"NO\".\n\n           So it works.\n\n           But wait: what if the grid has two different non-diagonal letters? Then we break at the first inconsistency.\n\n           However, the problem says: \"all other squares ... contain the same letter\". So if we find two different letters in the non-diagonal, then we break.\n\n           One more corner: what if the grid has non-diagonal cells that are all the same, but that letter is A? Then we break at the last condition.\n\n           Example: \n                n=3\n                a b c\n                b d e\n                c e f\n\n           Actually, we require the entire main diagonal and anti-diagonal to be A. In this example, the main diagonal is [a, d, f] and anti-diagonal is [c, d, c]. So unless a=d=f=c and they are A, and then non-diagonal cells must be the same and not A.\n\n           But let's assume:\n\n                a = A, and d = A, and f = A, and c = A (from anti-diagonal). Then the grid becomes:\n\n                A b A\n                b A A\n                A A A   (if f=A and c=A, then the last row: [2][0]=A, [2][1]=A, [2][2]=A)\n\n           Then the non-diagonal cells are [b, b, A] (wait, no: the non-diagonal cells are:\n\n                row0: [0,1] = b\n                row1: [1,0]=b, [1,2]=A -> but wait, [1,2] is on the anti-diagonal? No, anti-diagonal for row1: index = n-1-1 = 1, so [1,1] is the center, and [1,2] is not on the anti-diagonal? Actually, anti-diagonal is [0,2], [1,1], [2,0]. So [1,2] is not on the anti-diagonal, but [1,2] is part of the main diagonal? No, main diagonal is [0,0], [1,1], [2,2]. So [1,2] is not on any diagonal.\n\n           So the non-diagonal cells are:\n\n                row0: [0,1] = b\n                row1: [1,0] = b, [1,2] = A -> wait, but [1,2] is not on the diagonal? Then we have two different non-diagonal letters: b and A. Then we break at [1,2] because we set base_letter to b (from [0,1]) and then at [1,2] we see A which is not b -> NO.\n\n           But note: the condition requires that the non-diagonal cells are the same letter. So even if the non-diagonal cells are not the same as the diagonal letter, they must be the same among themselves.\n\n           Therefore, the code above is correct.\n\n           However, note: the example input might have the entire grid as the same letter? Then the non-diagonal cells are A, which is the same as the diagonal. Then we break at the condition: base_letter != A -> fails.\n\n           Example:\n\n                n=3\n                aaa\n                aaa\n                aaa\n\n           We check diagonals: \n                main: a,a,a -> A='a'\n                anti: a,a,a -> ok.\n\n           Then non-diagonal cells: we have four cells, all 'a'. Then base_letter='a', then check base_letter != A -> 'a' != 'a' -> false -> NO.\n\n           Which is correct.\n\n           But wait, what if the grid is:\n\n                n=3\n                x y x\n                y x y\n                x y x\n\n           Then the diagonals: \n                main: [0][0]='x', [1][1]='x', [2][2]='x' -> A='x'\n                anti: [0][2]='x', [1][1]='x', [2][0]='x' -> ok.\n\n           Then non-diagonal cells: \n                row0: [0,1]='y'\n                row1: [1,0]='y', [1,2]='y'\n                row2: [2,1]='y'\n\n           So base_letter='y', and 'y' != 'x' -> YES.\n\n           This matches.\n\n           One more corner: what if n=3 and the grid is:\n\n                a b c\n                d e f\n                g h i\n\n           and the main diagonal is all 'a', and the anti-diagonal is all 'a', but the non-diagonal cells are not uniform? \n\n                a b c\n                d e f\n                g h a   -> but anti-diagonal: c, e, g must be 'a'. So c='a', e='a', g='a'. Then the grid:\n\n                a b a\n                d a f\n                a h a\n\n           Then the non-diagonal cells: [0,1]='b', [1,0]='d', [1,2]='f', [2,1]='h'\n\n           They must be the same letter. Suppose we set them to 'b': then the grid:\n\n                a b a\n                b a b\n                a b a\n\n           Then base_letter='b' and 'b' != 'a' -> YES.\n\n           But if we set them to two different letters:\n\n                a b a\n                b a c\n                a d a\n\n           Then when we check [0,1]='b', then [1,0]='b' (ok), then [1,2]='c' (different from 'b') -> NO.\n\n           This meets the requirement.\n\n           Therefore, the code is as follows.\n\n           However, note: we assumed that the entire diagonal is the same by using A = grid[0][0]. But what if the grid[0][0] is not the same as the center? \n\n           Actually, the main diagonal must be the same, so grid[0][0] must equal grid[1][1] etc. Similarly for the anti-diagonal. But we are checking the entire diagonal, so if grid[0][0] is not the same as the center, then we break.\n\n           Example: \n\n                n=3\n                x y z\n                p q r\n                s t u\n\n           Then main diagonal: x, q, u -> we check: x==x (ok), then q must equal x, then u must equal x. So if x != q, then we break.\n\n           This is correct.\n\n           But note: the problem says the diagonals must be the same letter. So we are checking that.\n\n           Therefore, the code is:\n\n           n = int(input().strip())\n           grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n           # Check that the entire main diagonal is the same and the entire anti-diagonal is the same (and they are the same letter because the center is shared)\n           # Step 1: Check main diagonal\n           A = grid[0][0]\n           for i in range(n):\n               if grid[i][i] != A:\n                   print(\"NO\")\n                   exit(0)\n\n           for i in range(n):\n               if grid[i][n-1-i] != A:\n                   print(\"NO\")\n                   exit(0)\n\n           # Now, check non-diagonal cells\n           # We'll traverse the grid and collect the non-diagonal cells\n           base_letter = None\n           for i in range(n):\n               for j in range(n):\n                   if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                       continue\n                   if base_letter is None:\n                       base_letter = grid[i][j]\n                   elif grid[i][j] != base_letter:\n                       print(\"NO\")\n                       exit(0)\n\n           if base_letter is None:\n               # This means there are no non-diagonal cells. But for n>=3, there should be. However, if n==1, but n>=3, so we don't worry.\n               print(\"NO\")\n               exit(0)\n\n           if base_letter == A:\n               print(\"NO\")\n               exit(0)\n\n           print(\"YES\")\n\n           However, note: the above code does not account for the fact that the anti-diagonal might have a different starting letter? \n\n           Actually, we set A = grid[0][0] and then we check the entire anti-diagonal against A. But the anti-diagonal's first element is grid[0][n-1]. We are requiring that grid[0][n-1] == A. \n\n           But the condition says the entire anti-diagonal must be the same letter. However, we don't know that letter. We are using A from the main diagonal. \n\n           But note: the center is the same for both, so the entire anti-diagonal must be the same letter and that letter must be the same as the main diagonal's letter. \n\n           However, what if the main diagonal is all 'a' and the anti-diagonal is all 'b'? Then at the center (grid[n//2][n//2]) we have two conditions: it must be 'a' (from main) and 'b' (from anti). So if 'a' != 'b', then the center breaks. But we are checking the entire anti-diagonal for A (which is 'a'). So if the anti-diagonal is 'b', then we will see a cell (the center) that is 'b' and compare to A ('a') -> fail.\n\n           Example:\n\n                n=3\n                a b c\n                d e f\n                g h i\n\n           Suppose main diagonal is 'a','e','i' -> all 'a'. Then A='a'. Then we check anti-diagonal: \n                grid[0][2] = c -> must be 'a'\n                grid[1][1] = e -> must be 'a'\n                grid[2][0] = g -> must be 'a'\n\n           So if the anti-diagonal is not 'a', we break.\n\n           Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n           Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n           Example1: \n                Input: 5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox -> NO (our code returns NO, correct)\n\n           Example2: \n                Input: 3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw -> YES (correct)\n\n           Example3:\n                Input",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonals**: \n   - **Main Diagonal**: All elements from top-left to bottom-right must be identical.\n   - **Anti-Diagonal**: All elements from top-right to bottom-left must be identical.\n   - Additionally, the center element (common to both diagonals) must ensure both diagonals have the same letter.\n\n2. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**:\n   - All cells not on either diagonal must be the same letter and different from the diagonal letter.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    A = grid[0][0]\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][i] != A:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n    for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][n-1-i] != A:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n    base_letter = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            if base_letter is None:\n                base_letter = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != base_letter:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n                    \n    if base_letter is None:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if base_letter == A:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The grid dimensions and the grid itself are read from standard input.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: The code checks if all elements on the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) are the same letter. If any element differs, it immediately outputs \"NO\".\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: The code then verifies that all non-diagonal cells contain the same letter. If any non-diagonal cell differs, it outputs \"NO\". Additionally, this non-diagonal letter must differ from the diagonal letter.\n4. **Output Result**: If all conditions are satisfied, the code outputs \"YES\"; otherwise, it outputs \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the required conditions by leveraging simple loops and conditional checks, ensuring correctness while maintaining clarity.",
