    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\nWe are given two integers a and b (with 1 <= a, b <= 10^9). We need to find a non-negative integer k such that:\n   LCM(a+k, b+k) is minimized.\n\nNote: If multiple k yield the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\nLet d = (a+k) and e = (b+k). Then note that d - e = a - b (constant). So we are looking for k such that the LCM of two numbers that differ by a fixed amount (d = a-b) is minimized.\n\nWe can write:\n   Let g = gcd(a+k, b+k). Then LCM(a+k, b+k) = (a+k)*(b+k) / g.\n\nBut note that (a+k) and (b+k) are co-prime to each other? Not necessarily. However, note that the difference between them is |a-b|, so any common divisor must divide |a-b|.\n\nActually, we can set d0 = |a-b|. Then the gcd(a+k, b+k) must divide d0.\n\nIdea: Instead of iterating over k (which can be very large because a,b up to 10^9), we can consider divisors of d0.\n\nNote: Without loss of generality, assume a <= b. Then d0 = b - a (if a<=b). But if a > b, then d0 = a-b. So let d = |a-b|.\n\nNow, note that for k, the two numbers are (a+k) and (b+k). The condition for having a common divisor g is that g divides (a+k) and (b+k), so g divides (a+k - (b+k)) = a-b. Thus, g must divide d.\n\nMoreover, note that we can write:\n   Let g = gcd(a+k, b+k). Then g divides d.\n\nBut also, note that k must satisfy: \n   k ≡ -a (mod g)   and   k ≡ -b (mod g)\n\nSince g divides d, and d = a-b, we have that g divides a-b. The congruences are consistent because -a ≡ -b (mod g) since g divides (a-b).\n\nNow, what is the value of k for a fixed divisor g of d?\n   We require k ≡ (-a) mod g, i.e., k ≡ (g - a % g) mod g? Actually, we can write k = t*g + (-a mod g) but we want non-negative k.\n\nHowever, note: k must be at least max(0, ...) and we are going to consider all divisors g of d.\n\nBut note: there is a catch. The equation k ≡ -a (mod g) has a solution, and the smallest non-negative k for modulus g is the smallest non-negative residue: k0 = (g - a % g) % g. But wait, if a % g == 0, then k0=0, else k0 = g - (a % g) ? Actually, we want k such that (a+k) is divisible by g, i.e., k = (g - a % g) % g, but if a % g != 0 then k = g - (a % g) unless a % g ==0 then k=0.\n\nAlternatively, we can write: k ≡ (-a) mod g, so k = (g - (a % g)) % g? Actually, modulo operation: we want the smallest non-negative k such that (a+k) mod g ==0.\n\nBut note: if we take k = (g - (a % g)) % g, then if a % g ==0, then k=0. Otherwise, k = g - (a%g). However, note: (a % g) is in [0, g-1]. So this gives a k in [0, g-1].\n\nBut wait: there might be a smaller k? Actually, the general solution is k = k0 + t*g, for t>=0. However, we are only interested in the smallest non-negative k for each divisor g.\n\nSo for each divisor g of d (where d=|a-b|), we can set k0 = (g - a % g) % g. However, note that if we consider negative a? Actually, we can compute the positive remainder.\n\nBut note: we must consider that k must also satisfy k ≡ -b (mod g). Since g divides d, and d = a-b, then a ≡ b (mod g) is false? Actually, g divides d, so d % g ==0, and a-b is divisible by g, so a ≡ b (mod g). Therefore, the condition for a and b modulo g is the same. So k0 that satisfies k0 ≡ -a (mod g) automatically satisfies k0 ≡ -b (mod g). \n\nTherefore, for each divisor g of d, we can compute k0 as above, and then consider the candidate k = k0 (the smallest non-negative k for this divisor). Then we can compute the LCM for (a+k0) and (b+k0) and compare.\n\nBut note: the LCM for two numbers x and y is (x * y) // gcd(x,y). And note that gcd(x,y)=g? Actually, no: the gcd(x,y) might be a multiple of g? Or wait, we set g to be a divisor of d, but the actual gcd might be larger? \n\nActually, we are considering divisors g of d. The gcd(a+k, b+k) must be at least g, but note: the gcd must divide d, so it is one of the divisors. However, the candidate k0 we found makes g divide both (a+k0) and (b+k0). But the gcd might be larger than g. Then our candidate k0 might not give the maximum possible gcd. But wait, we are iterating over all divisors of d. For a fixed k, the gcd is the greatest common divisor of (a+k) and (b+k). This gcd must divide d, so it is one of the divisors. Therefore, we must consider the candidate k0 for every divisor g, and then the actual gcd for that k0 might be greater than g? \n\nActually, we can do better: the gcd for k0 is the gcd(a+k0, b+k0). But note that we set k0 such that g divides (a+k0) and (b+k0). However, the gcd might be a multiple of g. But we are iterating over all divisors, so we will eventually hit the true gcd. However, we don't know the true gcd until we compute it.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: the gcd(a+k, b+k) must be a divisor of d. So we can consider for each divisor g (of d) and set k0 to be the smallest non-negative integer such that g divides (a+k0) and (b+k0). Then the gcd might be a multiple of g. But note: the multiple must also divide d. So if we consider the divisor g and then the gcd turns out to be h (a divisor of d that is a multiple of g), then we would have considered h as well (if h is also a divisor). However, the candidate k0 we get from g might be different from the candidate k0 from h.\n\nBut note: the condition for h (a multiple of g) is stronger: k must satisfy k ≡ -a (mod h). And since h divides d, we can compute k0_h = (h - a % h) % h. But note that k0_g (from divisor g) might not satisfy the condition for h (unless h divides (a+k0_g) which is not necessarily true). \n\nSo we have to consider all divisors. However, note that the set of divisors is symmetric (if g is a divisor, then d//g is also a divisor). The total number of divisors of d is about O(sqrt(d)), which is acceptable even for d up to 10^9 (since 10^9 has around 1344 divisors in the worst case).\n\nBut wait: what if d=0? That is, if a==b. Then d=0, and we cannot iterate over divisors of 0. We must handle a==b separately.\n\nCase 1: a == b.\nThen for any k, we have two identical numbers: x = a+k, and LCM(x,x) = x. We want to minimize x. The smallest x is when k=0, so x = a. Therefore, k=0.\n\nCase 2: a != b.\nThen d = |a-b|, and we consider all divisors g of d.\n\nBut note: we must consider all divisors? Yes, because the gcd must be a divisor of d.\n\nHowever, note: the LCM is (a+k)*(b+k)/gcd(a+k, b+k). We want to minimize that.\n\nBut note: the product (a+k)*(b+k) is minimized when k is as small as possible? Not necessarily, because the gcd might be large enough to reduce the LCM even if the product is slightly larger.\n\nSo plan:\n1. If a == b: output 0.\n2. Otherwise, let d = abs(a-b).\n3. Factorize d to get all divisors.\n4. For each divisor g of d (including 1 and d):\n   a. Compute k0 = (g - a % g) % g   [This gives the smallest non-negative k such that g divides (a+k0)]\n   b. But note: we must ensure that k0 is non-negative and minimal. However, note that k0 is in [0, g-1].\n   c. However, we must check that with this k0, the gcd(a+k0, b+k0) might be greater than g? But we are iterating over all divisors, so we will eventually consider the true gcd. But note: we don't know the true gcd, so we can compute the LCM for candidate k0 and then compare.\n\nBut wait: we are iterating over divisors, and the candidate k0 we get for divisor g might not be the only candidate for a particular k. However, note that the problem says \"if there are multiple k with the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k\".\n\nBut note: we are generating candidates for each divisor. There might be duplicates? For example, if two divisors g1 and g2 lead to the same k0? Then we have to avoid duplicate computations. But k0 depends on g. However, the same k0 might appear from different divisors. But we are only interested in the minimal LCM and then the smallest k.\n\nBut note: the candidate k0 we get for a divisor g might be the same as the candidate k0 for a divisor h (even if g != h). Then we are computing the same k twice. To avoid that, we could use a set for k candidates? But note: we are iterating over divisors, and the candidate k0 for each divisor is independent.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider: for each divisor g, we compute k0, and then we consider the candidate k = k0. Then we compute the LCM for (a+k0) and (b+k0). But note: there might be a candidate k that is not generated by any divisor? No, because the gcd must divide d, so the condition for k is that gcd(a+k, b+k) divides d, and the minimal k for divisor g is k0. However, note that k0 is the minimal k for which g divides (a+k) and (b+k). But there might be a k smaller than k0 that gives a higher gcd (and hence a lower LCM) but we don't know. \n\nWait, actually, the problem requires the smallest LCM and then the smallest k. Our method of iterating over divisors and taking the minimal k for each divisor (k0) is valid because:\n\nThe LCM is determined by the product (a+k)*(b+k) divided by the gcd. The gcd is at least g (if we set k0 for divisor g). But the actual gcd might be a multiple of g, and then the LCM would be (a+k)*(b+k)/g' (with g'>=g). However, we are considering all divisors, so we will consider g'=g and also divisors that are multiples of g (if they exist). But note: the minimal k for divisor g' (which is a multiple of g) might be different.\n\nBut observe: the candidate k0 we compute for divisor g is the minimal k such that g divides (a+k) and (b+k). However, the minimal k for divisor g' (which is a multiple of g) is computed independently and may be larger or smaller. \n\nBut note: the minimal k for divisor g' must be at least as large as the minimal k for divisor g (if g divides g')? Not necessarily, because the condition for g' is stronger. \n\nExample: a=6, b=10, d=4. Divisors: 1,2,4.\n\nFor g=1: k0 = (1 - 6%1) % 1 -> 0 (since 6%1 is 0, then (1-0)%1=1%1=0). Then k0=0.\nFor g=2: k0 = (2 - 6%2) %2 = (2-0)%2=0.\nFor g=4: k0 = (4 - 6%4) %4 = (4-2)%4=2.\n\nThen we compute LCM for k=0: LCM(6,10)=30.\n           for k=0 (again): same as above.\n           for k=2: LCM(8,12)=24.\n\nBut note: the example output is 2.\n\nHowever, we must consider that the gcd for k=0 is gcd(6,10)=2, so the LCM is (6*10)/2 = 30. For k=2, the gcd(8,12)=4, so LCM=(8*12)/4=24.\n\nBut wait, we did not consider k=1? Why not? Because the gcd for k=1: gcd(7,11)=1, so LCM=77, which is worse. Similarly, k=3: gcd(9,13)=1, LCM=117. k=4: gcd(10,14)=2, LCM=70. k=5: gcd(11,15)=1, LCM=165. k=6: gcd(12,16)=4, LCM=(12*16)/4=48. But wait, 48 is less than 24? No, wait: 48 is for k=6. But 24 is less than 48. \n\nBut note: the example says k=2 is the answer. So our candidate k=2 (from divisor 4) gives 24, which is minimal.\n\nBut why didn't we get k=6? Because for divisor 4, the minimal k0 was 2, and then we also have to consider k=2+4*t for t>=0. But the problem says: if there are multiple k with the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k. \n\nHowever, note that the minimal LCM might occur at multiple k. In our example, k=2 gives LCM=24 and k=6 gives LCM=48? Actually, wait: for k=6, we have (6+6)=12 and (10+6)=16. Then LCM(12,16)= (12*16)/gcd(12,16)= (192)/4=48. So 48 is not minimal.\n\nBut wait, what about k=2 and k=6? They are two different candidates. However, the minimal k for divisor 4 is 2, and then the next candidate for divisor 4 is 2+4=6, then 10, etc. But note: the problem requires the smallest k that minimizes the LCM.\n\nBut here's the catch: we are only computing the minimal k for each divisor (i.e., the smallest non-negative k that satisfies the condition for that divisor). However, the LCM might be the same for different divisors, and also the same k might be generated by multiple divisors.\n\nBut note: the minimal k for divisor g is k0. Then for the same divisor g, the next candidate is k0 + g, then k0+2g, etc. So we should consider all k0 + t*g (t>=0) for each divisor g? \n\nBut wait, the problem: the input numbers a and b can be up to 10^9, and d can be up to 10^9, so the number of divisors is O(sqrt(d)), but the step size g can be large and we cannot iterate over all multiples (because k0 + t*g might be huge and we cannot check all).\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe note that the LCM is minimized when the product (a+k)*(b+k) is minimized relative to the gcd. But note that the product increases as k increases (unless a and b are negative, but they are positive). However, the gcd might increase and hence the LCM might drop.\n\nBut we can use the following: the best candidate k must be one for which the gcd(a+k, b+k) is as large as possible (relative to the product). But note, the product is increasing with k, so we want to balance.\n\nBut note: the LCM formula: LCM(a+k, b+k) = (a+k)*(b+k) / gcd(a+k, b+k)\n\nWe can also note that the gcd(a+k, b+k) must divide d. So the possible gcds are divisors of d.\n\nThen, for a fixed divisor g (which we hope to be the gcd), the minimal k that makes g divide both (a+k) and (b+k) is k0 = (g - a%g) % g.\n\nThen, for that k0, the gcd might be greater than g. But then we are effectively using a divisor that is a multiple of g. However, we are iterating over all divisors, so we will consider that multiple divisor.\n\nBut note: we must consider that the same k0 might be generated by multiple divisors. And we must consider that the LCM for k0 might be computed by the actual gcd (which is the gcd(a+k0, b+k0)), not necessarily g.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\n1. If a==b: print(0) and done.\n2. Else, d = abs(a-b)\n3. Factorize d to get all divisors.\n4. Collect candidate k values: For each divisor g of d, compute k0 = (g - a%g) % g. Then, we must consider k0, but note: we are only computing the minimal k for divisor g. However, there might be a candidate k that is not the minimal for any divisor? \n\nBut note: the gcd must be a divisor of d, so the condition for k is that it must satisfy k ≡ -a (mod g) for g being the gcd. Therefore, the minimal k for which the gcd is at least g is k0. But the actual gcd might be a divisor of d that is >=g. However, we are iterating over all divisors, so we will consider all g.\n\nBut now, the issue: we are only computing one candidate per divisor (the minimal k0). However, the minimal k overall might be k0 for divisor g, but also note that the same k0 might be generated by a divisor that is the actual gcd (and that divisor is a divisor of d). \n\nBut the problem: we must consider all k that are minimal for some divisor. However, note that the minimal k for a divisor g is k0, and we must compute the LCM for that k0. Then, we compare the LCMs and choose the smallest k that gives the minimal LCM.\n\nBut wait: what if the minimal k for divisor g is k0, but then there exists a divisor h (a divisor of d) such that k0 is also the minimal k for h? Then we are duplicating the candidate. But that's okay because we can use a dictionary to map k to the LCM and then choose the smallest k with the minimal LCM.\n\nBut note: the LCM for a given k is fixed, so we can compute once and store.\n\nBut the number of divisors is about O(sqrt(d)), so we can collect all candidate k0 from each divisor, then for each distinct candidate k0, compute the LCM, and then choose the candidate k0 with the smallest LCM, and if there are multiple, choose the smallest k0.\n\nHowever, note: there might be many divisors, but the candidate k0 is in [0, g-1] and g is a divisor of d, so g <= d. Since d <= 10^9, the candidate k0 is at most 10^9, but we are only generating as many as the number of divisors (about 1000). Then we can store these k0 and then compute the LCM for each distinct k0.\n\nBut wait: the same k0 might appear multiple times (for different divisors). Then we can use a set to remove duplicates.\n\nBut note: we must consider that the minimal k for divisor g is k0, but the actual k that minimizes the LCM might be any k (not necessarily the minimal for some divisor). However, we argued that the gcd must divide d, so the condition for k is that it must satisfy the congruence for the gcd. Therefore, the minimal k for the actual gcd (which is a divisor of d) is k0. So we are covering all possibilities.\n\nBut note: the minimal k for the actual gcd might be k0, and we are generating k0 for every divisor. However, the actual gcd might be a divisor that we haven't considered? No, we considered all divisors.\n\nTherefore, the plan is:\n\n1. If a == b: print(0)\n2. Else:\n   d = abs(a-b)\n   Find all divisors of d (including 1 and d).\n   candidates = set()\n   For each divisor g in divisors:\n        k0 = (g - a % g) % g\n        candidates.add(k0)\n\n   But wait, is that sufficient? Consider: the candidate k0 for divisor g is the minimal k such that g divides (a+k) and (b+k). However, note that the actual gcd might be a divisor h (which is a divisor of d) and h divides (a+k0) and (b+k0). Then we would have already considered h (if h is a divisor) and the candidate k0 might be the minimal k for h as well? \n\n   However, note: we are adding k0 for every divisor, but the same k0 might be the minimal for several divisors. But we are storing distinct k0.\n\n   Then, we must also consider that the minimal k for divisor g is k0, but there might be a candidate k that is smaller than k0 (but still satisfies that the gcd divides d) that we missed? \n\n   Actually, no: the minimal k for divisor g is k0, and if a divisor h (which is a divisor of d) requires a condition that is satisfied by k0, then we are also including k0 for divisor h. But note: k0 is the minimal k for divisor g, but it might not be minimal for divisor h. \n\n   Example: a=6, b=10, d=4. Divisors: [1,2,4]. \n        For g=1: k0 = (1-6%1)%1 -> 0 (because 6%1 is 0, so (1-0)%1=0). \n        For g=2: k0 = (2-6%2)%2 = (2-0)%2=0.\n        For g=4: k0 = (4-6%4)%4 = (4-2)%4=2.\n\n   Then candidates = {0,2}. Then we compute LCM for k=0 and k=2.\n\n   But wait: what about k=1? We didn't consider k=1. However, the condition for divisor 1 is satisfied by k=0, and for divisor 2 by k=0, and for divisor 4 by k=2. But note: the gcd for k=1 must divide 4. The gcd(7,11)=1, which is a divisor. Then k=1 satisfies the condition for divisor 1 (because 1 divides everything). But the minimal k for divisor 1 is 0, so we don't need to consider k=1 because 0 is smaller and we are going to compare the LCMs. However, we are missing k=1 in our candidate set.\n\n   But note: the condition for divisor 1 is satisfied by k0=0. Then for divisor 1, we only consider k0=0. But k=1 is not the minimal k for divisor 1? Actually, the minimal k for divisor 1 is 0, because 1 divides (a+k) for k=0: (6+0)=6 is divisible by 1. Similarly, k=0 is the smallest non-negative integer.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not require that the divisor g is the gcd. It requires that the gcd divides d. But the condition for the gcd (say h) is that h divides d and h divides (a+k) and (b+k). The minimal k for divisor h is k0_h. But if we take k=k0_h, then h divides (a+k) and (b+k). But note: h might be the gcd, or a divisor of the gcd? Actually, no: the gcd must be at least h, but we are iterating over all divisors. \n\n   But note: the minimal k for divisor h is k0_h. Then the minimal k for which the gcd is h is k0_h. However, we are not requiring that the gcd is exactly h, but that the gcd is at least h. \n\n   However, the LCM is (a+k)*(b+k)/gcd. The gcd is the greatest common divisor. So if we use k0_h, then the gcd might be greater than h. Then the LCM might be lower than expected.\n\n   But we are iterating over all divisors, so we will consider the divisor that is the actual gcd (if it is a divisor of d). \n\n   The issue is: we are not generating all k. We are generating the minimal k for each divisor. However, note that the minimal k for divisor h is k0_h, and then the next k for divisor h is k0_h + h, k0_h + 2*h, etc. But we are not considering those.\n\n   But note: the problem says the smallest k. So we are only concerned with the minimal k that achieves the minimal LCM.\n\n   However, the minimal k that minimizes the LCM might be k0_h for the divisor h (the actual gcd) and then we don't need to consider the multiples because k0_h is the smallest k that makes the gcd at least h. But note: the LCM is defined by the actual gcd (which might be greater than h). \n\n   However, there's a catch: the LCM might be minimized by a k that is not the minimal k for the divisor that is the gcd. For example, consider k0_h (minimal k for divisor h) and k0_h + h (next candidate for divisor h). Then the gcd for k0_h + h might be greater than h (maybe h' which is a multiple of h and divisor of d). Then the LCM might be even lower. But note: we are iterating over all divisors, so we will consider the divisor h' and the minimal k for h' (which might be k0_{h'} <= k0_h+h). \n\n   Therefore, we must consider all divisors, and the minimal k for each divisor is the candidate. Then, we compute the LCM for that candidate k.\n\n   However, note: the minimal k for divisor g is k0. Then the LCM for k0 is computed with the actual gcd (which is the gcd(a+k0, b+k0)). \n\n   But wait: the minimal k for divisor g is k0, but the actual gcd might be a divisor that is a multiple of g (and divides d). Then we are going to consider that divisor (if we iterate over all divisors) and the minimal k for that divisor might be k0 (if k0 is the minimal k for that divisor) or different.\n\n   Example: a=6, b=10, d=4. Divisors: [1,2,4]. \n        k0 for g=1:0 -> gcd(6,10)=2, so LCM=30.\n        k0 for g=2:0 -> same as above, but then we compute the same k=0 again.\n        k0 for g=4:2 -> gcd(8,12)=4, so LCM=24.\n\n   Now, what if we consider divisor 2: k0=0. Then we compute LCM(6,10)=30. But what if we consider k=2 (from divisor4)? Then we compute LCM=24.\n\n   But note: the minimal k for divisor4 is 2, and we don't consider k=0+4=4, etc.\n\n   However, we must consider: the minimal k for divisor4 is 2, but is k=2 the minimal k that yields a gcd that is a divisor of 4? Actually, yes, because for k=0 the gcd is 2 (which is a divisor) and for k=1 the gcd is 1 (divisor) and for k=2 the gcd is 4.\n\n   But note: the minimal k that yields the divisor4 is 2, and we are including k=2.\n\n   How about k=4 (from divisor4: 2+4=6)? Then k=4: numbers 10 and 14, gcd(10,14)=2, so LCM=70. But we don't need to consider k=4 because we are only taking the minimal k for each divisor (which is 2 for divisor4). \n\n   But wait: the problem says \"choose the smallest k\" if there are multiple k with the same minimal LCM. So if k=2 and k=6 both yield the same LCM, we choose k=2. But note: k=6 is not minimal for divisor4 (it's the next one) and we are not generating k=6 from divisor4. But we are generating k=2 from divisor4. \n\n   However, note: k=6 might be generated from divisor2: \n        For divisor2: minimal k0=0, then next candidate is 0+2=2, then 4, then 6. But wait, we are only generating the minimal k for each divisor, not the entire arithmetic progression.\n\n   But then how do we get k=6? \n\n   Actually, we are missing k=6. \n\n   We must consider: the condition for divisor2 is that 2 divides (a+k) and (b+k). The minimal k is 0. But the next k is 2, then 4, then 6, etc. However, we are only generating the minimal k for divisor2 (which is 0). Then we never consider k=2,4,6 from divisor2. \n\n   But note: k=2 is generated from divisor4 (as minimal k). Similarly, k=4 is generated from divisor2? Actually, for divisor2: minimal k0=0, then the next candidate is 2 (because 0+2=2) but wait, we are only storing the minimal k for each divisor. \n\n   The problem: we are not generating all k that are solutions for each divisor. We are only generating the minimal k. But the minimal k for divisor g is the smallest non-negative k satisfying the condition. Then the next k is minimal_k + g, then minimal_k + 2g, etc. \n\n   However, the problem requires the smallest k overall. So we must consider the minimal k for each divisor, and then also note that the same k might be generated by multiple divisors, and then we compare the LCM for each candidate k (the minimal k for each divisor). But wait, the minimal k for divisor g is k0, and the next candidate for divisor g is k0+g, which is larger. So the smallest k overall must be one of the minimal k0 for the divisors.\n\n   Why? Because if k0 is the minimal k for divisor g, then any k < k0 does not satisfy the condition for divisor g. But note: the condition for divisor g is that g divides (a+k) and (b+k). However, the actual k that minimizes the LCM might not be forced by any divisor? \n\n   Actually, no: the condition is that the gcd must divide d, so the minimal k for which the gcd is at least g (for some divisor g) is k0. But note: the condition for the gcd being at least g is weaker than the condition for the gcd being exactly g. \n\n   However, the minimal k for the divisor g is k0, and then the next candidate is k0+g. But note: we are only storing k0 (the minimal) for each divisor. Then we are missing k0+g, k0+2g, etc.\n\n   But note: the minimal k overall must be the minimal k0 among all divisors. Why?\n\n   Because if k_min is the smallest k that minimizes the LCM, then the gcd for that k_min must be a divisor g of d. Then k_min must be at least the minimal k0 for divisor g. But wait: the minimal k0 for divisor g is the smallest k that satisfies the condition for divisor g. Then k_min must be >= k0_g. But k_min might be greater than k0_g, but we are storing k0_g. \n\n   However, we are storing the minimal k for each divisor, and then we are comparing the LCM for each stored k. But if k_min is not one of the minimal k for any divisor, then we are missing it.\n\n   But note: the condition for k_min is that the gcd(a+k_min, b+k_min) is a divisor g of d. Then k_min must satisfy k_min >= minimal_k0 for divisor g. But the minimal_k0 for divisor g is the minimal k that satisfies the condition for divisor g. However, k_min might be a solution for divisor g but not the minimal one. Then we are missing k_min.\n\n   Example: a=6, b=10, d=4. Divisors: [1,2,4]. \n        For divisor1: minimal k0=0.\n        For divisor2: minimal k0=0.\n        For divisor4: minimal k0=2.\n\n        Now, consider k_min=2. We have it from divisor4.\n\n        But consider k_min=4. Is there a divisor g for which 4 is the minimal k? \n            For divisor1: minimal k0=0 -> 4>=0, but we already have a candidate 0 which is smaller.\n            For divisor2: minimal k0=0 -> 4>=0, but again 0 is smaller.\n            For divisor4: minimal k0=2 -> 4>=2, and 4 is the next candidate (2+2) for divisor4.\n\n        But note: the condition for divisor4 is satisfied by k=2,4,6,... so k=4 is a candidate for divisor4. However, we are only storing the minimal k (2) for divisor4.\n\n        But then we compute the LCM for k=2 and k=4. However, if k=2 gives LCM=24, and k=4 gives LCM=70, then we don't care about k=4 because 2 is smaller and gives a lower LCM.\n\n        But what if k=4 gave a lower LCM than k=2? Then we would have a problem because we are not considering k=4.\n\n   However, note: the LCM for k=4: numbers 10 and 14 -> gcd=2, so LCM=(10*14)/2=70, which is worse.\n\n   But consider another example: a=21, b=31 (example input). The example output is 9.\n\n   Let d=10. Divisors: 1,2,5,10.\n\n   For g=1: k0 = (1 - 21%1)%1 = 0.\n   For g=2: k0 = (2-21%2)%2 = (2-1)%2=1.\n   For g=5: k0 = (5-21%5)%5 = (5-1)%5=4.\n   For g=10: k0 = (10-21%10)%10 = (10-1)%10=9.\n\n   Then we compute:\n        k=0: numbers 21,31 -> gcd=1, LCM=21*31=651.\n        k=1: numbers 22,32 -> gcd=2, LCM= (22*32)//2 = 352.\n        k=4: numbers 25,35 -> gcd=5, LCM= (25*35)//5=175.\n        k=9: numbers 30,40 -> gcd=10, LCM= (30*40)//10=12",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find a non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a+k \\) and \\( b+k \\) is minimized. If multiple values of \\( k \\) yield the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the difference between \\( a+k \\) and \\( b+k \\) is constant (\\( |a-b| \\)). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\( a+k \\) and \\( b+k \\) must be a divisor of this difference. Therefore, we can leverage the divisors of \\( |a-b| \\) to determine potential values of \\( k \\) that could minimize the LCM.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( |a-b| \\), we compute the smallest non-negative \\( k \\) such that \\( g \\) divides both \\( a+k \\) and \\( b+k \\). This \\( k \\) is given by \\( k = (g - (a \\% g)) \\% g \\). We then compute the LCM for these candidate \\( k \\) values and select the smallest \\( k \\) that results in the minimal LCM.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Special Case Handling**: If \\( a \\) equals \\( b \\), the answer is trivially \\( 0 \\) since \\( k=0 \\) minimizes the LCM.\n   - **Divisor Enumeration**: For \\( a \\neq b \\), compute all divisors of \\( |a-b| \\).\n   - **Candidate Generation**: For each divisor \\( g \\), compute the minimal \\( k \\) that satisfies the condition for \\( g \\).\n   - **LCM Calculation**: For each candidate \\( k \\), compute the LCM of \\( a+k \\) and \\( b+k \\).\n   - **Optimal Selection**: Track the minimal LCM and the smallest \\( k \\) that achieves it.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm's efficiency hinges on the number of divisors of \\( |a-b| \\), which is \\( O(\\sqrt{d}) \\) where \\( d = |a-b| \\). Given \\( d \\) can be up to \\( 10^9 \\), the maximum number of divisors is around 1344 (for highly composite numbers), making this approach feasible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nfrom math import gcd\n\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    d = abs(a - b)\n    divisors = set()\n    i = 1\n    while i * i <= d:\n        if d % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(d // i)\n        i += 1\n        \n    candidates = set()\n    for g in divisors:\n        remainder = a % g\n        if remainder == 0:\n            k0 = 0\n        else:\n            k0 = g - remainder\n        candidates.add(k0)\n        \n    best_k = None\n    best_lcm = None\n    \n    for k in candidates:\n        num1 = a + k\n        num2 = b + k\n        g_val = gcd(num1, num2)\n        current_lcm = (num1 * num2) // g_val\n        if best_lcm is None or current_lcm < best_lcm or (current_lcm == best_lcm and k < best_k):\n            best_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k\n            \n    print(best_k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) from standard input.\n2. **Special Case Check**: If \\( a \\) equals \\( b \\), it immediately outputs \\( 0 \\) since the LCM of any number with itself is the number itself, minimized at \\( k=0 \\).\n3. **Divisor Calculation**: For \\( a \\neq b \\), the code computes all divisors of \\( |a-b| \\) by iterating up to the square root of \\( |a-b| \\).\n4. **Candidate Generation**: For each divisor \\( g \\), the smallest \\( k \\) ensuring \\( g \\) divides both \\( a+k \\) and \\( b+k \\) is calculated using modular arithmetic.\n5. **LCM Evaluation**: For each candidate \\( k \\), the LCM of \\( a+k \\) and \\( b+k \\) is computed.
