Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are going to process multiple queries that replace each occurrence of a digit with a string (which may be empty). However, note that the replacements are done in sequence and the same digit might appear in multiple queries.\n\n Important: The total length of all replacement strings is at most 10^5, so we can precompute the replacements for each digit.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the queries are performed in order. But if we do naive replacements (like doing a string replacement for each query from left to right) then the string can become very long (exponentially in the worst-case) and we cannot store the entire string.\n\n Example: \n   Start with \"2\", then query \"2->00\", then \"0->7\". Then we get \"00\" then \"77\". But if we have many replacements, the string might blow up.\n\n Alternative approach: We cannot build the entire string because the string can become too long.\n\n Instead, we need to compute the number modulo 1000000007 without building the huge string.\n\n Observation: Each query replaces every occurrence of a digit d by a string t. Then the next query operates on the entire current string.\n\n We can think of the entire process as a transformation on the initial string, but we have to account for the fact that the same digit might be replaced multiple times.\n\n However, note: the queries are given in order. So the first query replaces one set of digits, then the second query replaces the digits (which now might include digits from the replacement of the first query) and so on.\n\n But note: the replacement strings can contain digits that are being replaced by subsequent queries? \n\n Example: \n   Input: \"222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7\"\n   Step1: Replace '2' by \"00\" -> \"000\"\n   Step2: Replace '0' by \"7\" -> \"777\"\n\n However, the problem says: the queries are performed in the order given.\n\n But the catch: the replacement in a query applies to the current state of the string.\n\n We cannot do a naive pass for each query because the string might become too large.\n\n Alternative idea: process the queries backwards? Or use dynamic programming?\n\n Another idea: represent the transformation by each query as a function that maps an original digit to a final string after all subsequent queries.\n\n Let f_i(d) be the string that the digit d becomes after processing queries i, i+1, ..., n.\n\n Then, we can process the queries from last to first, and update the transformation for each digit.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Initially, for each digit d (from '0' to '9'), we set f_i(d) = d (as a string) for the base case (after all queries, the digit remains).\n\n 2. Then, for each query from the last one to the first one, we update the transformation for the digit di:\n\n    For the current query: \"di->ti\", then for each digit d (from '0' to '9'):\n        If d == di, then the transformation for d becomes ti (because we are replacing di by ti, and then the rest of the queries will transform ti according to the already computed functions for subsequent queries).\n        Otherwise, the transformation for d remains the same.\n\n    But wait: the query replaces every occurrence of di by ti. And then the subsequent queries will transform ti.\n\n    Actually, we want to know what happens to a digit d in the current state. If d is not di, then it remains and is transformed by the subsequent queries (so we use the current f_{i+1}(d)). If d is di, then we replace it by ti, and then apply the subsequent transformations (queries i+1 to n) to the entire string ti.\n\n    However, we are storing for each digit d the string that d becomes after the remaining queries. Then, when we do the query \"di->ti\", the transformation for di is updated to: we take the string ti and then for each character c in ti, we replace it by the transformation that will be applied to c in the subsequent queries (but note: the subsequent queries are already processed, so we have for each digit the transformation for the rest of the queries). \n\n    So the update is:\n\n        For each digit d (from '0' to '9'):\n            if d == di:\n                Then the new transformation for d is the concatenation of the transformations (for the subsequent queries) of each digit in ti.\n            else:\n                remains the same.\n\n    However, note: the transformation for a digit d is the entire string that the digit d becomes after the remaining queries. So if we have a query that replaces '2' by \"34\", then the transformation for '2' becomes the transformation of '3' (for the subsequent queries) concatenated with the transformation of '4' (for the subsequent queries).\n\n 3. Then, once we have the transformation for each digit for the entire set of queries (i.e., from the first query to the last), we can process the initial string s:\n\n        result_string = \"\"\n        for each char c in s:\n            result_string += transformation(c)\n\n    But again, we cannot build the entire string because it might be too long.\n\n 4. Alternatively, we can compute the number modulo 1000000007 by processing the entire transformation without building the string.\n\n How?\n\n    We need to compute the number represented by the final string.\n\n    We can use the idea of dynamic programming for the entire transformation, but also keeping track of the value and the length (or the power of 10) contributed by each part.\n\n    Actually, we can compute the value modulo 1000000007 and the length (in terms of the number of digits) of the transformed string for each digit.\n\n    However, note: the transformation for a digit d is a string. We can precompute for each digit d (after all queries) the following:\n\n        val[d] = the numerical value of the transformed string for d modulo 1000000007\n        len[d] = the length (number of digits) of the transformed string for d\n\n    Then, how to combine two transformations?\n\n    Suppose we have two consecutive digits, say d1 and d2, and their transformations are:\n\n        d1 -> A (a string of length L1 and value V1)\n        d2 -> B (a string of length L2 and value V2)\n\n    Then the entire string is A followed by B.\n\n    The numerical value of A followed by B is: V1 * (10^(L2)) + V2.\n\n    So we need to know the value and the length of the transformation for each digit.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        Let's define for each digit d (from '0' to '9') two arrays (or two variables) that we update as we process the queries backwards:\n\n            val[d]: the value (mod 1000000007) of the transformed string for d after all queries.\n            len[d]: the length (number of digits) of the transformed string for d.\n\n        Initially, for each digit d (from '0' to '9'):\n\n            val[d] = d (converted to integer) % mod\n            len[d] = 1\n\n        Then, we process the queries from last to first. For each query (di, ti):\n\n            Let the current state (for the remaining queries) for each digit be stored in val and len.\n\n            We are going to update the transformation for the digit di.\n\n            For the digit di, the transformation becomes the string ti. But note: each character in ti must be transformed by the subsequent queries (which we have already processed, so we have the current val and len for each digit).\n\n            Therefore, for di:\n\n                new_val = 0\n                new_len = 0\n\n                For each char c in ti:\n                    new_val = (new_val * (10 ** len[c])) % mod   [But wait: we cannot use exponentiation with exponents that are the lengths? We need to use modular exponentiation?]\n\n                However, note: the value of the entire transformation for ti is the concatenation of the transformations of each character in ti.\n\n                Example: ti = \"34\", then we have:\n                    transformation of '3' gives a string with value V3 and length L3, and transformation of '4' gives a string with value V4 and length L4.\n\n                Then the entire transformation for ti is the number formed by the string of length L3+L4, which is: V3 * (10^(L4)) + V4.\n\n                So we can do:\n\n                    new_val = 0\n                    for c in ti:\n                        # Append the transformation of c to the current new_val.\n                        new_val = (new_val * pow(10, len[c], mod)) % mod\n                        new_val = (new_val + val[c]) % mod\n                        new_len += len[c]\n\n            Then set for digit di:\n\n                val[di] = new_val\n                len[di] = new_len\n\n            For other digits, we leave val[d] and len[d] unchanged.\n\n        Then, after processing all queries, we process the initial string s:\n\n            result_val = 0\n            for each char c in s:\n                result_val = (result_val * pow(10, len[c], mod)) % mod\n                result_val = (result_val + val[c]) % mod\n\n        But note: the modulus is 1000000007.\n\n        However, we must consider that the transformation for a digit d might be built from multiple steps, and we are updating the val and len for each digit as we go backwards.\n\n        Also, note: the queries are given in the forward order, so we process them from last to first.\n\n        Example: \n            Input: \"222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7\"\n\n            Queries: \n                Query1: \"2->00\"\n                Query2: \"0->7\"\n\n            We process from last to first: first update with query2, then query1.\n\n            Step 1: Process query2 (\"0->7\")\n                For digit '0': \n                    ti = \"7\"\n                    new_val = 0\n                    For c in \"7\": \n                        new_val = (0 * (10^len['7']) + val['7']) % mod\n                    But initially, for '7': val['7'] = 7, len['7']=1.\n                    So new_val = 7, new_len = 1.\n\n                Now update: val['0'] becomes 7, len['0'] becomes 1.\n\n            Step 2: Process query1 (\"2->00\")\n                For digit '2':\n                    ti = \"00\"\n                    We break ti into two characters: '0' and '0'\n                    For the first '0': use the updated val['0'] = 7, and len['0']=1.\n                    For the second '0': same.\n\n                    new_val = (0 * (10^1) + 7) % mod = 7\n                    then new_val = (7 * (10^1) + 7) % mod = 77\n                    new_len = 1+1 = 2.\n\n                So update: val['2'] = 77, len['2'] = 2.\n\n            Then, the initial string \"222\" is transformed by each '2' becoming \"00\", but then the two zeros become two sevens? Actually, no: the two zeros are replaced by \"7\" each, so the entire transformation for '2' is \"77\", so \"222\" becomes \"777777\", but wait, that doesn't match the example.\n\n            Correction: The example input was \"222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7\", and the expected output is \"777\".\n\n            Why? Because the example does:\n\n                Start: \"222\"\n                First query: replace '2' by \"00\" -> becomes \"000\"\n                Second query: replace '0' by \"7\" -> becomes \"777\"\n\n            In our backward processing, we did two queries and updated the transformation for '2' to be the transformation of \"00\", and the transformation of \"00\" is the transformation of two zeros, and each zero becomes 7, so \"00\" becomes \"77\", so the entire string \"222\" becomes \"777777\". But the example output is \"777\".\n\n            What's wrong?\n\n            The problem: In the example, the first query replaces each '2' by \"00\", so the string becomes \"000\". Then the second query replaces each '0' by \"7\", so the entire \"000\" becomes \"777\".\n\n            But note: in the backward processing, we are updating the transformation for the digit '0' to become '7' (a single digit). Then the transformation for '2' is defined as the transformation of \"00\", which is two zeros, and each zero becomes 7, so two sevens, i.e., the string \"77\", which has two digits.\n\n            Then, the initial string \"222\" (three digits) is transformed to three times the transformation of '2', so we get the string \"77\" repeated three times? That would be \"777777\", but the example expects \"777\".\n\n            Why the discrepancy?\n\n            The issue: In the backward processing, we are updating the transformation for each digit to account for all subsequent queries. However, in the example, the first query is \"2->00\", and then the second query is \"0->7\". When we process the first query (which is the one that comes first, but we are processing backwards) we update the transformation for '2'. But note: the second query has already been processed and updated the transformation for '0'. So the transformation for '2' becomes the transformation of \"00\", which is two zeros, and each zero has been transformed to a single '7'. So the entire transformation for '2' is two sevens, i.e., the string \"77\", which is two digits.\n\n            Then, the initial string \"222\" is three digits, so we replace each '2' by two digits, so the total length is 3*2 = 6, and the value is calculated by:\n\n                result_val = 0\n                for each '2' in \"222\":\n                    result_val = (result_val * (10^(len['2'])) + val['2']) % mod\n\n                First '2': result_val = 0 * (10^2) + 77 = 77\n                Second '2': result_val = 77 * (10^2) + 77 = 7700 + 77 = 7777\n                Third '2': result_val = 7777 * 100 + 77 = 777700 + 77 = 777777\n\n            But the example expects 777.\n\n            The problem is that the example does the first query and then the second query. After the first query, the string is \"000\", and then the second query replaces each '0' by '7', so the entire string becomes \"777\", which is three digits.\n\n            In our backward processing, we are effectively merging the two queries. The first query (forward) replaces '2' by \"00\", and then the second query replaces every '0' (including the ones that came from the first query) by \"7\". So the entire process is equivalent to replacing '2' by \"77\", but wait: actually, the two zeros become two sevens, so yes, each '2' becomes two sevens. But then why the example output is 777?\n\n            Wait, let me re-read the example: the sample input provided was:\n\n                Input: \n                    ['222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n                Output: \n                    ['777', '1']\n\n            So the example input string is \"222\", and the two queries are:\n\n                2->00\n                0->7\n\n            Then the example output is 777.\n\n            But according to the example, the transformation is:\n\n                Step1: \"222\" becomes \"000\"\n                Step2: \"000\" becomes \"777\"\n\n            So the entire transformation for '2' should be \"77\", but note: the second query replaces each '0' by \"7\", so each '0' becomes \"7\", and there are two zeros per replacement of '2', so two sevens. Then \"222\" becomes \"77\" three times, i.e., \"777777\", but that is 6-digit number, and the example output is 777 (which is 3-digit).\n\n            There's a misunderstanding: the example output is printed as the number 777, but wait the example input includes:\n\n                Input: ['222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n            and the output is:\n\n                ['777', '1']\n\n            But the example description says: \"222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7\" -> output \"777\"\n\n            However, note: the example input format is a list of strings. But in the problem statement, the input is:\n\n                The first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.\n                The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.\n\n            So the first sample input is:\n\n                \"222\"\n                2\n                2->00\n                0->7\n\n            Then the output is 777.\n\n            But wait, the example transformation:\n\n                Start: \"222\"\n                After first query: \"000\"\n                After second query: \"777\"\n\n            So the resulting string is \"777\", which is 3-digit.\n\n            Why did our backward processing for the digit '2' become \"77\"? \n\n            The backward processing:\n\n                We start with the last query: \"0->7\"\n                For digit '0', we set its transformation to the transformation of \"7\", which is the digit '7' (value 7, length 1).\n\n                Then we process the first query: \"2->00\"\n                For digit '2', we set its transformation to the transformation of \"00\", which is the transformation of two zeros, each zero becomes the transformation of \"7\", so:\n\n                    First zero: value=7, length=1\n                    Second zero: value=7, length=1\n\n                Then the transformation for \"00\" is: \n                    value = (7 * (10^1) + 7) % mod = 77\n                    length = 1+1 = 2.\n\n                Then we process the initial string \"222\":\n\n                    result_val = 0\n                    For first '2': result_val = (0 * (10^2) + 77) = 77\n                    For second '2': result_val = (77 * (10^2) + 77) = 7700+77 = 7777\n                    For third '2': result_val = (7777 * (10^2) + 77) = 777700+77 = 777777\n\n                This gives 777777, but expected is 777.\n\n            Why is this happening? \n\n            The issue is that in the backward processing, the transformation for a digit d is the entire string that d becomes after all the queries. In the example, the two queries are:\n\n                Query1: replace '2' by \"00\"\n                Query2: replace '0' by \"7\"\n\n            After both queries, the digit '2' is replaced by \"00\", and then each '0' in \"00\" is replaced by \"7\", so indeed the digit '2' becomes \"77\". \n\n            Then, the initial string \"222\" becomes \"77\" repeated three times: \"777777\".\n\n            But the example says the output is 777.\n\n            Let me check the example again: the example input is:\n\n                Input: \"222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7\"\n\n            Then the example output is:\n\n                \"777\"\n\n            This implies that the transformation is:\n\n                \"222\" -> \"000\" (by replacing each '2' by \"00\") and then \"000\" -> \"777\" (by replacing each '0' by \"7\").\n\n            So the entire transformation for the initial string is \"777\", which is the same as if we had a direct transformation from '2' to \"7\" (but note: the replacement is two zeros, and then each zero becomes a seven, so two sevens per two zeros, but wait: two zeros become two sevens, so one '2' becomes two sevens. Then three '2's become six sevens? \n\n            There's a contradiction.\n\n            Let me do the transformation step-by-step:\n\n                Start: \"222\"\n                After first query: replace every '2' by \"00\": \n                    '2' becomes \"00\", so the string becomes \"000\".\n                After second query: replace every '0' by \"7\": \n                    each '0' becomes \"7\", so \"000\" becomes \"777\".\n\n            So the result is \"777\", which is three digits.\n\n            Why did our backward method give 777777?\n\n            Because in the backward method, we are transforming the digit '2' to the entire string that it becomes after all queries, which is \"77\", and then we are just putting together three copies of \"77\", which is \"777777\".\n\n            But wait, the example does not say that the first query is applied and then the second query is applied only to the original string? No, the problem says: Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". And these are performed in the order given.\n\n            The key: the second query replaces ALL occurrences of '0' (at any position) by '7'. In the string \"000\", there are three zeros, so they are replaced by three sevens. But in our backward method, the transformation for the digit '2' is the entire transformation of the string \"00\", which is two zeros. Then, the two zeros are replaced by two sevens, so the entire transformation for '2' is two sevens, i.e., the string \"77\". Then, the initial string \"222\" (which has three '2's) is transformed to three times the string \"77\", i.e., \"777777\".\n\n            However, the example output is \"777\", not \"777777\".\n\n            I see the mistake: the example input string is \"222\", which has three digits. The first query replaces each '2' (each occurrence) by \"00\", so we get three times \"00\", i.e., \"000000\"? \n\n            Wait, no: the string is \"222\", which has three characters. Replacing each '2' by \"00\" means:\n\n                Original: ['2','2','2']\n                After replacing: ['0','0','0','0','0','0']? \n\n            Actually, no: the replacement is done for each occurrence independently. The string \"222\" is three '2's. Each '2' is replaced by two '0's, so we get two '0's for each '2', so the total length is 2*3 = 6, and the string is \"000000\".\n\n            Then the second query: replace each '0' by \"7\". There are six '0's, so we get six '7's: \"777777\".\n\n            But the example says the result is \"777\".\n\n            Now I'm confused.\n\n            Let me read the example again: the example says:\n\n                Input: \n                    ['123123\\n1\\n2->00', \n                     '123123\\n1\\n3->', \n                     '222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7', \n                     '1000000008\\n0']\n\n                Output:\n                    ['10031003', \n                     '1212', \n                     '777', \n                     '1']\n\n            The third sample input is \"222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7\", and the output is \"777\".\n\n            But wait, the example transformation for the third sample:\n\n                Query1: \"2->00\": \n                    s = \"222\" -> becomes \"000000\" (because each '2' is replaced by \"00\", and there are three '2's)\n                Query2: \"0->7\": \n                    s = \"000000\" -> becomes \"777777\"\n\n            Then the output should be 777777, but the example output is 777.\n\n            This suggests that the example output is the number 777, not the string \"777\". But the problem says: \"Print a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\"\n\n            And the resulting number from the string \"777777\" is 777777, and from the string \"777\" is 777.\n\n            How can the result be 777 then?\n\n            The example input \"222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7\" produces the string \"777777\", so the number is 777777, and 777777 % 1000000007 is 777777, which is not 777.\n\n            There must be a misunderstanding in the example.\n\n            Looking back at the example outputs:\n\n                Input: \"123123\\n1\\n2->00\" -> Output: \"10031003\" (which is the string, but the problem says the output is the number modulo 1000000007, so we output 10031003 % 1000000007 = 10031003)\n\n                Input: \"123123\\n1\\n3->\" -> Output: \"1212\"\n\n                Input: \"222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7\" -> Output: \"777\"\n\n            Wait, the example output for the third sample is \"777\", meaning the number is 777? But the transformation leads to \"777777\", which is a six-digit number.\n\n            Alternatively, maybe the example output is not the string but the number? And the example outputs are the numbers (with leading zeros ignored, but note: the problem says ignore leading zeros, but the example does not remove zeros in the middle).\n\n            But 777777 is different from 777.\n\n            After reading the example again: the example says:\n\n                Input: \"123123\\n1\\n2->00\" -> transforms s to 10031003 (string) and then we output 10031003 mod 1000000007, which is 10031003.\n\n                Input: \"123123\\n1\\n3->\" -> transforms s to 1212 (string) and then output 1212.\n\n            So the output is the number represented by the string, modulo 1000000007.\n\n            For the third sample: the resulting string is \"777777\", so the number is 777777, and 777777 mod 1000000007 is 777777.\n\n            But the example output is 777.\n\n            There is a discrepancy.\n\n            Let me check the sample input and output provided in the problem statement:\n\n            The example input is given as:\n\n                ['123123\\n1\\n2->00', \n                 '123123\\n1\\n3->', \n                 '222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7', \n                 '1000000008\\n0']\n\n            And the output is:\n\n                ['10031003', \n                 '1212', \n                 '777', \n                 '1']\n\n            Wait, the first two outputs are strings? The problem says to output the remainder of division by 1000000007, so integers.\n\n            The example output for the third sample is \"777\", which is an integer.\n\n            But the transformation of \"222\" by two queries gives a string of six '7's, which is 777777, and 777777 mod 1000000007 is 777777, not 777.\n\n            However, the fourth sample: \"1000000008\\n0\" -> output 1.\n\n            This suggests that the example output for the third sample is 777, but we are getting 777777.\n\n            I think there is a mistake in the example or in my understanding.\n\n            Let me look at the sample transformation in the problem statement:\n\n                Example: if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212.\n\n            So the first example: \n                s = \"123123\"\n                Query: \"2->00\": \n                    We replace the two '2's (at positions 2 and 5, 0-indexed) by \"00\", so the string becomes \"10031003\".\n\n            Then the second example: \n                s = \"123123\"\n                Query: \"3->\": remove all '3's -> becomes \"1212\".\n\n            Now, the third example:\n\n                s = \"222\"\n                Query1: \"2->00\": replaces each '2' by \"00\", so the string becomes \"000000\"\n                Query2: \"0->7\": replaces each '0' by \"7\", so the string becomes \"777777\"\n\n            So the resulting string is \"777777\", and the number is 777777.\n\n            But the example output is 777.\n\n            Unless the example output for the third sample is not 777 but something else. Or the example input is different.\n\n            Wait, the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then lists the examples.\n\n            Then, the sample inputs and outputs are as provided.\n\n            But the sample input \"222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7\" should yield 777777, but the example output is 777.\n\n            Alternatively, the example output might be the string representation without extra formatting, but the problem says to output the number modulo 1000000007.\n\n            There is a possibility that the example output for the third sample is a typo and it should be 777777.\n\n            However, let me check the sample output \"777\" for the third sample: \n\n                The sample input is:\n\n                    \"222\"\n                    2\n                    2->00\n                    0->7\n\n            And the sample output is 777.\n\n            But 777 is the number represented by the string \"777\", not \"777777\".\n\n            How could the result be the string \"777\"?\n\n            One possibility: the queries are not applied to the entire string at once, but sequentially, and the second query only applies to the digits that are originally '0'? \n\n            But the problem says: \"Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries ... replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\".\n\n            So the first query replaces all '2's, and the second query replaces all '0's (even if they were inserted by the first query).\n\n            Another possibility: the queries are applied in reverse order? \n\n            But the problem states: \"the queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\"\n\n            Or: the example input \"222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7\" is meant to be processed as:\n\n                Query1: \"2->00\"\n                Query2: \"0->7\"\n\n            But the example output is the result after the first query only? \n\n            Let me read the example output format: \n\n                Input: ['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n                Output: ['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n            The first input is \"123123\\n1\\n2->00\", output \"10031003\" (which is the number 10031003).\n            The second input is \"123123\\n1\\n3->\", output \"1212\" (which is the number 1212).\n            The third input is \"222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7\", output \"777\".\n            The fourth input is \"1000000008\\n0\", output \"1\".\n\n            The fourth sample: \n                s = \"1000000008\", n=0 -> no query, so the number is 1000000008, then 1000000008 % 1000000007 = 1.\n\n            The second sample: \n                s = \"123123\", n=1, query \"3->\" (remove all '3's). The string becomes \"1212\", so the number is 1212.\n\n            The first sample: \n                s = \"123123\", n=1, query \"2->00\". The string becomes \"10031003\", so the number is 10031003.\n\n            The third sample: \n                s = \"222\", n=2, queries: \n                    \"2->00\": becomes \"000000\"\n                    \"0->7\": becomes \"777777\"\n\n            Then the number is 777777.\n\n            But the output is 777.\n\n            Unless the example intended to say that the transformation is done only once per query, and the queries are applied in the order given, but the problem does not say anything about limiting the replacement to the original digits. It says \"replace all digits di\", meaning all occurrences at that moment.\n\n            But then the result is \"777777\", not \"777\".\n\n            There's a possibility that the example input for the third sample is different. Maybe it is:\n\n                \"222\"\n                2\n                2->00\n                # and then the next query is not applied to the whole string? \n\n            Or perhaps the example input is:\n\n                \"222\"\n                2\n                2->0\n                0->7\n\n            Then the first query: replace '2' by \"0\", so \"222\" becomes \"000\"\n            Then the second query: replace '0' by \"7\", so \"000\" becomes \"777\"\n\n            Then the result is \"777\", and the number is 777.\n\n            This matches.\n\n            So the example input for the third sample might have been:\n\n                '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7'\n\n            But the problem statement wrote:\n\n                '222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7'\n\n            This is a typo in the problem statement.\n\n            Let me verify with the sample input provided in the problem statement:\n\n                The sample input is given as:\n\n                    ['1231",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a series of string replacement queries on an initial digit string and compute the resulting number modulo 1000000007. The challenge lies in efficiently handling the replacements without explicitly constructing the potentially enormous intermediate strings, which could be computationally infeasible due to exponential growth in string length.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Backward Processing of Queries**: Instead of processing each query in the given order (which would lead to inefficient string manipulations), we process them in reverse order. This allows us to determine, for each digit, what it transforms into after all subsequent queries.\n2. **Digit Transformation Tracking**: For each digit (0-9), maintain two pieces of information after each query:\n   - **Value (`val[d]`)**: The numerical value of the transformed string for the digit `d` modulo 1000000007.\n   - **Length (`len[d]`)**: The number of digits in the transformed string for `d`.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: For each query \"di → ti\", update the transformation for digit `di` by combining the transformations of each character in `ti`. Specifically, the new value for `di` is computed by concatenating the values of the characters in `ti` (using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers), and the new length is the sum of the lengths of these characters.\n4. **Final Computation**: After processing all queries backward, compute the final number by processing the initial string character by character, using the precomputed `val` and `len` arrays for each digit. The result is built iteratively, leveraging modular arithmetic to keep numbers manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nmod = 1000000007\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    s = data[0].strip()\n    n_line = data[1].strip()\n    n = int(n_line) if n_line else 0\n    \n    queries = []\n    for i in range(2, 2 + n):\n        line = data[i].strip()\n        if '->' in line:\n            parts = line.split('->')\n            di = parts[0].strip()\n            ti = parts[1].strip()\n            queries.append((di, ti))\n    \n    val = [i % mod for i in range(10)]\n    length_arr = [1] * 10\n    \n    for i in range(len(queries)-1, -1, -1):\n        di, ti = queries[i]\n        d = int(di)\n        total_val = 0\n        total_len = 0\n        power_base = 1\n        for char in ti:\n            c = ord(char) - ord('0')\n            total_len += length_arr[c]\n            total_val = (total_val * pow(10, length_arr[c], mod)) % mod\n            total_val = (total_val + val[c]) % mod\n        \n        val[d] = total_val\n        length_arr[d] = total_len\n\n    result = 0\n    for char in s:\n        c = ord(char) - ord('0')\n        result = (result * pow(10, length_arr[c], mod)) % mod\n        result = (result + val[c]) % mod\n\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the initial string and the list of queries.\n2. **Initialization**: Two arrays, `val` and `length_arr`, are initialized for digits 0-9. `val` stores the numerical value of the transformed string for each digit, and `length_arr` stores the length of that string.\n3. **Backward Query Processing**: Each query is processed in reverse order. For each query \"di → ti\", the transformation for digit `di` is updated by combining the transformations of each character in `ti`. This involves calculating the new value and length by leveraging the existing `val` and `length_arr` values of the characters in `ti`.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The initial string is processed character by character. For each character, its transformed value and length are used to update the result, which is computed iteratively using modular arithmetic to prevent overflow and ensure correctness.\n5. **Output**: The final result, which is the number represented by the transformed string modulo 1000000007, is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the potentially exponential growth of the string by focusing on digit transformations and modular arithmetic, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
