Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering the gaps between lanterns and the ends.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the list of lantern positions.\n 2. The entire street must be covered from 0 to l.\n 3. Consider two parts: \n    a) The left end (from 0 to the first lantern)\n    b) The gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n    c) The right end (from the last lantern to l)\n\n 4. For the left end: we need to cover from 0 to the first lantern at position a0.\n    The required d for the left end is at least a0 / 2.0.\n\n 5. For the gaps between two consecutive lanterns (say, between a[i] and a[i+1]):\n    The gap is (a[i+1] - a[i]). To cover this gap, the two lanterns must have a light that meets in the middle.\n    So, the required d for this gap is (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.0.\n\n 6. For the right end: we need to cover from the last lantern a[-1] to l, so the required d is (l - a[-1]) / 2.0.\n\n 7. Then, the minimum d that covers the entire street is the maximum of these three values.\n\n However, note: we can also think about having the lanterns extend their light beyond the gaps. Actually, the condition for the entire street is that the union of the intervals [a_i - d, a_i + d] must cover [0, l].\n\n But note: we can use the following approach:\n\n   Let d_left = a[0] / 2.0   (to cover from 0 to a[0])\n   Let d_right = (l - a[-1]) / 2.0 (to cover from a[-1] to l)\n\n   For each gap i from 0 to n-2: \n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        d_gap = gap / 2.0\n\n   Then answer = max(d_left, d_right, all d_gap)\n\n However, wait: what if two consecutive lanterns are more than 2*d apart? Actually, the above formula for gaps is correct because the two lanterns must cover the entire gap. The maximum d needed for the gap is (gap)/2.0. \n\n Example: Input \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n   n=2, l=5, lanterns at [2,5]\n\n   d_left = 2/2 = 1.0\n   d_right = (5-5)/2 = 0.0\n   gap between 2 and 5 is 3 -> d_gap = 1.5\n\n   Then we take the maximum: max(1.0, 0.0, 1.5) = 1.5, but expected output is 2.0.\n\n Why is the example output 2.0?\n\n Let me reexamine the example: \n   We have two lanterns at 2 and 5. The street is from 0 to 5.\n   If d=2, then:\n        First lantern at 2: covers [0,4] (because 2-2=0, 2+2=4)\n        Second lantern at 5: covers [3,7] (but since our street ends at 5, we only consider [3,5]).\n        Now, the entire street [0,5] is covered? From 0 to 4 by the first, and from 3 to 5 by the second. So 4 to 5 is covered by the second? Actually, the first lantern doesn't reach 5, but the second one does. However, the gap between 4 and 5 is only 1 unit. But note: the first lantern's coverage goes up to 4, and the second starts at 5. There is a gap from 4 to 5? \n\n Actually, wait: the second lantern is at 5, so with d=2, it covers [5-2, 5+2] = [3,7]. Since our street ends at 5, we consider [3,5]. Therefore, from 0 to 4 is covered by the first, and from 3 to 5 is covered by the second. But what about the point 4.5? It is not covered by either? \n\n Let me clarify: \n   With d=2, the first lantern at 2: covers [0,4] (so 0 to 4 inclusive).\n   The second lantern at 5: covers [3,7] (so 3 to 7). \n\n   Then the segment [4,5] is covered? \n      The first lantern: at 2, distance to 4.5 is 2.5, which is >2 -> not covered by first.\n      The second lantern: distance from 5 to 4.5 is 0.5, which is <=2 -> covered by second.\n\n   But wait, the entire street is [0,5]. The first lantern covers [0,4] and the second covers [3,5]. So the entire street [0,5] is covered? Yes, because from 0 to 4 is covered and from 3 to 5 is covered, so every point in [0,5] is covered (for example, 4.5 is in [3,5]).\n\n However, note that the example says: \"At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5].\" This is correct. And the whole street is lit.\n\n But why did we get 1.5 as the gap requirement? Because the gap is 3 (from 2 to 5). The midpoint is (2+5)/2 = 3.5. The distance from the left lantern (2) to the midpoint (3.5) is 1.5, so if the lantern at 2 has d>=1.5, then 3.5 is covered. Similarly, the lantern at 5 must have d>= (5-3.5)=1.5. Therefore, the gap requires d>=1.5.\n\n But wait, the sample output is 2.0. Why is that? \n\n Let me check the sample input and output again: \n   Input: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n   Expected Output: \"2.0000000000\"\n\n So why is 2.0 the minimum? \n\n Actually, the above reasoning for the gap is not the complete story. We require that the entire street is covered. In the gap method, we require that the two lanterns together cover the entire gap. The condition for the gap [a_i, a_{i+1}] is that the coverage from the left lantern must extend at least to a_i + d, and the coverage from the right lantern must extend at least to a_{i+1} - d. Moreover, the two must meet or overlap.\n\n The minimal d that covers the entire gap is the minimal value such that:\n   a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d   =>  2*d >= a_{i+1} - a_i   => d >= (a_{i+1}-a_i)/2.\n\n However, note that the entire street must be covered. But the above condition ensures that the gap is covered. However, the entire street also includes the left and right ends.\n\n But wait: in the example, the gap requires d>=1.5, but the left end requires d>=1.0 and the right end requires d>=0.0. So the maximum is 1.5. However, the sample output is 2.0.\n\n This implies that my reasoning for the entire street is incomplete.\n\n Let me think again: the problem says that the same d is used for all lanterns.\n\n The key: the entire street must be covered. We must ensure that from 0 to the first lantern, from the first lantern to the second, ..., and from the last lantern to l are all covered.\n\n However, note that the lanterns can also extend beyond the next lantern to cover the next gap. But the minimal d might be determined by the gaps and the ends.\n\n Why is the sample answer 2.0 then?\n\n Let me try with d=1.5 in the example:\n   First lantern at 2: covers [2-1.5, 2+1.5] = [0.5, 3.5]\n   Second lantern at 5: covers [5-1.5, 5+1.5] = [3.5, 6.5]\n\n   Now, check the entire street [0,5]:\n     [0,0.5): not covered by the first lantern (since 0.5 is the start) and the second lantern doesn't cover 0.5 (its leftmost is 3.5). So 0.5 is the start of the first lantern's coverage, but what about 0 to 0.5? \n\n   Wait, the first lantern at 2 with d=1.5: the left coverage is 0.5, so 0 to 0.5 is not covered. \n\n   But wait, the left end was originally calculated as requiring d>=1.0. With d=1.0, the first lantern would cover [1,3]. Then the left end from 0 to 1 is not covered. \n\n   Actually, to cover the left end, the first lantern must extend from 0 to 2+d. So we require 2-d <= 0? No, actually we require that the first lantern's left boundary (2-d) must be <= 0? Actually, no: the requirement is that the entire street [0, l] is covered.\n\n   The condition for the left end: the first lantern must cover from 0 to at least 2-d <= 0? Actually, no: the first lantern must cover from 0 to the first lantern. The minimal d to cover 0 is d >= 2 (if we want the first lantern to cover 0)? \n\n   Actually, the first lantern at 2 must have d >= 2 to cover 0? Because 2-d <= 0 => d>=2. But wait, that's not the case: the lantern covers [2-d, 2+d]. We require 2-d <= 0 => d>=2. \n\n   But wait, we don't require that the first lantern alone covers 0. Actually, the entire street must be covered. The first lantern covers [2-d, 2+d]. We require that 0 is in [2-d, 2+d] OR that there is some lantern that covers 0. But the first lantern is the one closest to 0 (in the sorted list). \n\n   Actually, the condition for the left end is: the first lantern must have d such that 2-d <= 0, i.e., d>=2. \n\n   Similarly, for the right end: the last lantern must have d such that 5+d >=5? Actually, the last lantern at 5 must cover l=5, but 5+d>=5 is always true. However, we require that the entire street up to l=5 is covered. The last lantern must cover from 5-d to 5+d. The part from the last lantern to l is [5-d, 5+d] and we require that 5 is covered, which is always true. But also, the part from the last lantern's coverage must extend to l? Actually, the requirement is that the entire street is [0,5]. The last lantern must cover from 5-d to 5+d, so the point 5 is covered. But the part from (5-d) to 5 is covered. However, we don't require the last lantern to extend beyond the street. The condition for the right end is: the last lantern's coverage must extend to at least l? Actually, the last lantern must cover the point l. So we require 5+d >= l, but l is 5, so 5+d>=5 -> d>=0. \n\n   Now, what about the gap? The gap is from 2 to 5. The first lantern covers [2-d, 2+d] and the second [5-d,5+d]. The entire street is covered if:\n        [0,5] is contained in the union of [2-d,2+d] and [5-d,5+d].\n\n   Conditions:\n        Left: 2-d <= 0   => d>=2\n        Right: 5+d >=5   => always true (d>=0)\n        Middle: the two intervals must cover the entire segment [0,5]. The gap between the two intervals is from (2+d) to (5-d). We require that (2+d) >= (5-d) OR that the intervals overlap.\n\n   Alternatively, we can say: the entire street is covered if the union of the intervals is connected and covers [0,5]. \n\n   Since the first lantern must cover from 0 to 2+d, and the second lantern must cover from 5-d to 5, we require that 2+d >= 5-d, i.e., 2*d >= 3 -> d>=1.5.\n\n   But the left condition requires d>=2. Therefore, the minimal d is 2.\n\n   So the error in the initial approach was the calculation for the left end. The left end condition is: the first lantern must cover the point 0. Therefore, the distance from the first lantern (at a0) to 0 must be <= d, i.e., d >= a0 - 0 = a0. But wait, that is not the entire condition because the first lantern also covers to the right. Actually, the condition for the left end is: the first lantern must cover 0, so d must be at least the distance from the first lantern to 0, which is a0. But note: the lantern at a0 gives coverage [a0-d, a0+d]. To cover 0, we require a0-d <= 0 => d>=a0.\n\n   Similarly, for the right end: the last lantern must cover l, so we require a_last + d >= l => d >= l - a_last.\n\n   For the gaps: we require that the gap between two consecutive lanterns is covered. The gap between a_i and a_{i+1] must be covered by the two lanterns. The left lantern must cover up to a_i+d, and the right lantern must cover from a_{i+1}-d. We require that a_i+d >= a_{i+1}-d, i.e., d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2.\n\n   Then, the answer is the maximum of:\n        d1 = a0   (to cover the left end)   [Note: but wait, if we set d=a0, then the first lantern covers [0, 2*a0]. But note: the first lantern is at a0, so the left coverage is a0-d, and we set d=a0, then the left coverage is 0. The right coverage is 2*a0.]\n        d2 = l - a_last   (to cover the right end)\n        d3 = (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2 for each gap i\n\n   However, let's test with the example: \n        n=2, l=5, lanterns=[2,5]\n        d1 = 2 (distance from first lantern to 0)\n        d2 = 5-5 = 0\n        d3 = (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n\n        Then answer = max(2,0,1.5) = 2.0 -> matches.\n\n   Now, consider the first sample: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n        We sort the lanterns: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\n        d1 = 0 (distance from the first lantern at 0 to 0) -> 0\n        d2 = 15-15 = 0\n        gaps: \n          3-0 -> 3/2 = 1.5\n          5-3 -> 2/2 = 1.0\n          7-5 -> 2/2 = 1.0\n          9-7 -> 2/2 = 1.0\n          14-9 -> 5/2 = 2.5\n          15-14 -> 1/2 = 0.5\n\n        Then the maximum is 2.5 -> matches.\n\n   But wait, what if the first lantern is already at 0? Then d1=0, which is correct.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the left end is that the first lantern must cover 0. If the first lantern is at 0, then the condition is d>=0 (which is trivial). Similarly, if the last lantern is at l, then d>=0.\n\n   But now, consider another example: \n        Input: \"1 10\\n5\"\n        n=1, l=10, lantern at [5]\n\n        Then:\n          d1 = 5 (to cover from 0 to 5: the first lantern must cover 0, so d>=5)\n          d2 = 10-5 = 5\n          no gaps\n\n          answer = max(5,5) = 5.0\n\n        This makes sense: the lantern at 5 must cover from 0 to 10. The distance from 5 to 0 is 5, and from 5 to 10 is 5. So d>=5.\n\n   Another example: \n        Input: \"3 10\\n0 5 10\"\n        Then:\n          d1 = 0\n          d2 = 0\n          gaps: [5-0]=5 -> 2.5; [10-5]=5 -> 2.5\n          answer = 2.5\n\n        But wait, with d=2.5:\n            First lantern: [0-2.5, 0+2.5] = [-2.5, 2.5] -> covers [0,2.5] (we only care from 0 to 10)\n            Second lantern: [5-2.5,5+2.5] = [2.5,7.5]\n            Third lantern: [10-2.5,10+2.5] = [7.5,12.5]\n\n            The entire street [0,10] is covered: from 0 to 2.5 by the first, 2.5 to 7.5 by the second, and 7.5 to 10 by the third. \n\n        But note: the gap between the first and second lantern: the first lantern covers up to 2.5, and the second starts at 2.5. So they meet exactly. Similarly for the second and third.\n\n   However, wait: the condition for the gap is (a_{i+1}-a_i)/2, and here the gaps are 5 and 5, so (5/2)=2.5. So it works.\n\n   But wait, what if we have a lantern at 0 and a lantern at 10, and the street is from 0 to 10? \n        Input: \"2 10\\n0 10\"\n        Then:\n          d1 = 0\n          d2 = 0\n          gap = 10 -> 5.0\n          answer = 5.0\n\n        With d=5.0: \n            First lantern: [0-5,0+5] = [-5,5] -> covers [0,5]\n            Second lantern: [10-5,10+5] = [5,15] -> covers [5,10]\n            So the entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n   Now, what if the lanterns are not sorted? We should sort them.\n\n   Algorithm:\n     Step 1: Read n and l.\n     Step 2: Read the list of n integers and sort them.\n\n     Step 3: \n        candidate1 = the first lantern's position (to cover the left end: d >= candidate1)\n        candidate2 = l - last lantern's position (to cover the right end: d >= candidate2)\n\n        candidate3 = for each consecutive pair (a[i], a[i+1]): (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.0\n\n     Step 4: The answer is the maximum of candidate1, candidate2, and all candidate3.\n\n   However, wait: is candidate1 really the first lantern's position? \n\n        Condition for the left end: we require that the first lantern's coverage extends to 0. The first lantern is at a0. The leftmost point we can cover with that lantern is a0-d. We require a0-d <= 0 -> d>=a0.\n\n        But note: if there are multiple lanterns, the condition for the left end is only that the entire segment [0, a0] is covered. Actually, the first lantern must cover from 0 to a0 (at least). The distance from 0 to a0 is a0, so d must be at least a0.\n\n        Similarly, for the right end: the last lantern must cover from a_last to l, and the distance from a_last to l is l - a_last, so d must be at least l - a_last.\n\n   But wait, what if the first lantern is not at 0? Then the condition is that the first lantern must cover from 0 to a0. The leftmost point of the first lantern is a0-d, so we require a0-d <= 0 -> d>=a0.\n\n   However, note: the entire street from 0 to a0 must be covered. The first lantern covers [a0-d, a0+d]. We require that 0 is in [a0-d, a0+d] -> a0-d <= 0 <= a0+d. Since a0>=0, the condition 0<=a0+d is always satisfied if d>=0. The critical condition is a0-d<=0 -> d>=a0.\n\n   Similarly, for the right end: the last lantern covers [a_last-d, a_last+d]. We require that l is in [a_last-d, a_last+d] -> a_last-d <= l <= a_last+d. The condition l<=a_last+d is always true because a_last<=l and d>=0, so the critical condition is a_last-d<=l -> which is always true because a_last<=l and d>=0. Actually, we require that the last lantern covers the point l. The condition for the last lantern to cover l is: a_last + d >= l -> d>= l - a_last.\n\n   So the conditions are:\n        d >= a0 (to cover the left end)\n        d >= l - a_last (to cover the right end)\n        d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2 for every consecutive pair (to cover the gaps)\n\n   Therefore, the minimal d is the maximum of these.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the left end is d>=a0, but what if the first lantern is at 0? Then a0=0, so d>=0. That is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if we have two lanterns: [0, 1] and l=2?\n        Then:\n          candidate1 = 0\n          candidate2 = 2-1 = 1\n          candidate3 = (1-0)/2 = 0.5\n\n          answer = 1.0\n\n        Check with d=1.0:\n          First lantern: [0-1,0+1] = [-1,1] -> covers [0,1] (the entire left part including 0 and the first lantern's segment)\n          Second lantern: [1-1,1+1] = [0,2] -> covers from 0 to 2.\n\n          So the entire street [0,2] is covered.\n\n        But wait, the left end is covered by the first lantern (with d=1: [0-1,0+1] includes 0) and the right end by the second lantern (covers up to 2). The gap between 0 and 1: the first lantern covers up to 1, and the second lantern starts at 0, so they meet. Actually, the gap condition: (1-0)/2 = 0.5, so the minimal d for the gap is 0.5, but we also have to cover the right end (which requires d>=1). So the answer is 1.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, wait: what if we have a lantern at 0 and then the next at 3, and the street is from 0 to 10?\n        n=2, l=10, lanterns=[0,3]\n        candidate1 = 0\n        candidate2 = 10-3 = 7\n        candidate3 = (3-0)/2 = 1.5\n\n        Then answer = 7.0.\n\n        Check: d=7.0\n          First lantern: [0-7,0+7] = [-7,7] -> covers [0,7] (the entire street from 0 to 7 is covered by the first lantern, and the second lantern covers [3-7,3+7] = [-4,10] which covers from -4 to 10. The entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n        But note: the condition for the right end is 7 (from the last lantern at 3: 10-3=7). So d must be at least 7.\n\n        However, is there a possibility that a smaller d could work? \n          We must cover from 0 to 10. The first lantern at 0 with d=7 covers [0,7]. The second lantern at 3 with d=7 covers [3-7,3+7] = [-4,10]. The union is [-4,10] which covers [0,10]. But what if we use d=5?\n          First lantern: [0-5,0+5] = [-5,5] -> covers [0,5].\n          Second lantern: [3-5,3+5] = [-2,8] -> covers [0,8] (since 0 is included in [-2,8] and 8 is the maximum we need for the street until 10? Actually, the street goes to 10, so the second lantern doesn't cover 8 to 10. But wait, the entire street [0,10] must be covered. The second lantern covers up to 8, and the first lantern only up to 5. Then from 5 to 8 is covered by the second lantern (since 5 is in [-2,8]), but from 8 to 10 is not covered by any lantern.\n\n        So d must be at least 7.\n\n   Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        # If there's only one lantern, then we have to cover both ends from that one lantern.\n        # But our method still works.\n\n        candidates = []\n\n        # Left end: d must be at least the distance from the first lantern to 0\n        candidates.append(a[0])\n\n        # Right end: d must be at least the distance from the last lantern to l\n        candidates.append(l - a[-1])\n\n        # Gaps: for each consecutive pair\n        for i in range(n-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            # The required d for this gap is gap/2.0\n            candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n\n        # The answer is the maximum candidate\n        ans = max(candidates)\n\n        # Format the answer to have 9 decimal places\n        print(\"{:.9f}\".format(ans))\n\n   However, wait: what if the street is empty (n=0)? The problem states n>=1.\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\" -> sorted [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n        candidates:\n          left: 0\n          right: 15-15 = 0\n          gaps: \n            (3-0)=3 -> 1.5\n            (5-3)=2 -> 1.0\n            (7-5)=2 -> 1.0\n            (9-7)=2 -> 1.0\n            (14-9)=5 -> 2.5\n            (15-14)=1 -> 0.5\n\n        max(candidates) = 2.5 -> correct.\n\n   Example 2: \"2 5\\n2 5\" -> sorted [2,5]\n        candidates:\n          left: 2\n          right: 5-5=0\n          gap: (5-2)=3 -> 1.5\n        max = 2.0 -> correct.\n\n   But wait, why did the example 2 give 2.0? The gap condition gave 1.5, but the left condition gave 2.0. So the maximum is 2.0.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the left end is that the first lantern (at 2) must cover 0. So the distance from 2 to 0 is 2, so d>=2. The gap condition only requires 1.5, but the left condition requires 2.0. Therefore, the answer is 2.0.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   But wait, what if the first lantern is not the one that must cover the entire left? Actually, the first lantern is the one closest to 0. The condition for the left end is that the entire segment from 0 to the first lantern must be covered by the first lantern (or by the combination of lanterns? Actually, the entire street must be covered. However, the first lantern is the closest to 0, so if we use a lantern further away, it might not help for the left end. Therefore, the left end must be covered by the first lantern. Similarly, the right end must be covered by the last lantern.\n\n   However, consider: \n        Input: \"3 10\\n1 5 9\"\n\n        This means lanterns at 1,5,9 and street from 0 to 10.\n\n        candidate1 = 1 (left end: d>=1 to cover 0 from the first lantern at 1)\n        candidate2 = 10-9=1 (right end: d>=1 to cover 10 from the last lantern at 9)\n        gaps: \n            (5-1)=4 -> 2.0\n            (9-5)=4 -> 2.0\n\n        Then answer = 2.0.\n\n        Check with d=2.0:\n          First lantern at 1: [1-2,1+2] = [-1,3] -> covers 0 (since 0 is in [-1,3]) and up to 3.\n          Second lantern at 5: [5-2,5+2] = [3,7] -> covers from 3 to 7.\n          Third lantern at 9: [9-2,9+2] = [7,11] -> covers from 7 to 10 (since 10 is in [7,11]? Actually, 10 is in [7,11] -> yes.\n\n          The entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n        Now, what if we use d=1.0?\n          First lantern: [-1,2] -> covers 0 to 2.\n          Second lantern: [4,6] -> does not cover 3 (which is needed to connect the first lantern's coverage to the second). So the segment [2,4) is not covered.\n\n        Therefore, the answer 2.0 is correct.\n\n   However, wait: the gap condition for the first gap (from 1 to 5) is (5-1)/2 = 2.0. So the gap condition already requires 2.0.\n\n   But note: the left end condition only requires 1.0, but the gap condition requires 2.0. Therefore, the maximum is 2.0.\n\n   One more example: \n        Input: \"1 10\\n5\"\n        candidates: left=5, right=5, no gaps -> 5.0 -> correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n        candidates = [a[0]]  # left end\n        candidates.append(l - a[-1])  # right end\n        for i in range(len(a)-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n\n        ans = max(candidates)\n        print(\"{:.9f}\".format(ans))\n\n   But wait: the problem statement says the first sample input is given as:\n        Input: ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n   However, note: the sample input has two test cases? Or is it two separate examples? Actually, the problem says:\n\n        Input\n        The first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l).\n\n   So the input is one test case per run. But the example shows two test cases. \n\n   Since the problem is competitive programming and the input is read from stdin, we assume one test case per execution.\n\n   However, the example input is given as two lines: first line \"7 15\", second line \"15 5 3 7 9 14 0\", and then another test case? Actually, the example input format is shown with two test cases in one string. But the problem says: \"The first line contains ...\", so we read one test case.\n\n   The sample input in the example is two separate examples. In competitive programming, the input is usually one test case. But the problem says nothing about multiple test cases. \n\n   According to the problem statement, we are to read two integers and then a list of n integers.\n\n   Therefore, the code above is for one test case.\n\n   But note: the example input is given as two strings in a list. This is just for representation.\n\n   We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, wait: what if there are multiple test cases? The problem statement doesn't specify multiple test cases. The constraints say n>=1, so at least one lantern.\n\n   Let me check the problem statement: \"Input\" section only describes one test case.\n\n   Therefore, we assume one test case.\n\n   But the example input has two test cases? Actually, the example input is:\n\n        ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n   This is two test cases. However, the problem says:\n\n        Input\n        The first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l).\n\n   So the input format is one test case.\n\n   But the example output has two answers. \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"Print the minimum light radius d\".\n\n   The example input is given as two separate lines, but the sample input is provided as:\n\n        Input: \n          7 15\n          15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\n        Output: 2.5000000000\n\n        Input: \n          2 5\n          2 5\n\n        Output: 2.0000000000\n\n   So the example input is two test cases. But the problem statement does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n   After reading the problem statement again, it does not mention multiple test cases. Therefore, we must assume one test case.\n\n   However, the example input in the problem is provided as two separate examples. \n\n   Clarification: The problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then gives the problem. The input format is one test case.\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as:\n\n        ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n   This is two test cases. The problem says:\n\n        Input\n        The first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l).\n\n   So if we are getting two test cases, then we must read until EOF.\n\n   However, the problem statement does not specify",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` required for all lanterns to illuminate the entire street from point `0` to point `l`. The solution involves analyzing the positions of the lanterns and calculating the necessary radius to cover the entire street efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The street is a straight line from `0` to `l`, and each lantern lights all points within a distance `d` from its position. The goal is to find the smallest `d` such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern.\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Left End Coverage**: The first lantern must extend far enough to the left to cover point `0`. The required radius here is the distance from the first lantern to `0`.\n   - **Right End Coverage**: Similarly, the last lantern must extend far enough to the right to cover point `l`. The required radius here is the distance from the last lantern to `l`.\n   - **Gap Coverage**: For any two consecutive lanterns, the gap between them must be covered by their combined illumination. The minimal radius required for each gap is half the distance between the two lanterns.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves sorting the lantern positions and then computing three values:\n   - The distance from the first lantern to `0`.\n   - The distance from the last lantern to `l`.\n   - Half the distance between each pair of consecutive lanterns.\n   The maximum of these values gives the minimal `d` needed to illuminate the entire street.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    candidates = []\n    if n > 0:\n        candidates.append(a[0])\n        candidates.append(l - a[-1])\n        for i in range(n-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n    \n    ans = max(candidates) if candidates else 0.0\n    print(\"{:.9f}\".format(ans))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns `n`, the street length `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to easily identify the first and last lanterns, as well as consecutive pairs.\n3. **Candidate Calculation**:\n   - **Left End**: The distance from the first lantern to `0` is `a[0]`.\n   - **Right End**: The distance from the last lantern to `l` is `l - a[-1]`.\n   - **Gaps**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the required radius to cover the gap is half the distance between them.\n4. **Result Determination**: The maximum value among all calculated candidates is the minimal `d` needed. This value ensures the entire street is illuminated, considering both the ends and the gaps between lanterns.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of nine decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal illumination radius by leveraging sorting and simple arithmetic operations, ensuring optimal coverage of the entire street.",
