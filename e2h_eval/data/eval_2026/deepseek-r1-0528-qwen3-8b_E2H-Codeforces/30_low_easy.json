Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given n and a string A of 2n digits.\n There are two players: Homer (H) and Marge (M). Each makes exactly n moves.\n On each move, the player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their own number.\n\n The goal is to maximize the total prize, which is S1 (Homer's number) + S2 (Marge's number).\n\n However, note that the game proceeds in 2n moves. At each move, the current player (alternating) takes the first digit.\n\n Since we can choose the order of moves (by deciding who goes first? Actually, the problem says \"before each turn players determine\", but note: the entire sequence must have exactly n moves by each. The problem does not specify that the first move is fixed. But note: the example input and output:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: n=2, A=\"1234\" -> Output: \"HHMM\"\n Example 2:\n   Input: n=2, A=\"9911\" -> Output: \"HMHM\"\n\n However, note that the example outputs are sequences of 4 characters (for n=2). The problem says: output the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge.\n\n Important: We are allowed to choose the sequence of moves arbitrarily (as long as each player makes exactly n moves) because the problem says \"if there are several solutions, output any\".\n\n But wait: the moves are taken from the leftmost digit. So the digits are fixed in order. The only decision is: at each step, which player takes the next digit? But note: the problem states that before each turn they determine who will make the next move.\n\n However, the catch: the entire sequence must be such that the digits are taken from the left in order. So the i-th digit (from left) is always taken at the same position, but by either H or M.\n\n How to think?\n\n Let A = d0 d1 d2 ... d_{2n-1}\n\n We have to assign each digit to either Homer or Marge, with exactly n digits for each.\n\n The value for Homer is the number formed by the digits assigned to him (in the order they were taken). Similarly for Marge.\n\n But note: the digits are taken in the order of A. So if Homer takes the first digit, then the second digit is taken by whoever (the other player) and so on.\n\n However, the assignment must be consistent: the first digit must be taken by one of the players (at the very first move). Then the second by the other, unless we break the alternation? \n\n Wait, the problem says: \"each player should make exactly n moves\" and \"on its turn i-th player\" ... but it doesn't say that the turns alternate. However, the examples:\n\n Example 1: A=\"1234\", n=2, output \"HHMM\": meaning the first two moves are by Homer, then the last two by Marge.\n\n But note: the game has 2n moves. The problem does not specify that the turns must alternate. However, the example outputs show that the moves can be grouped together.\n\n Actually, reading the problem statement: \"On its turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si.\" and \"They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize.\"\n\n And the output is a string of 2n characters, each being 'H' or 'M'.\n\n So the key is: we can choose an arbitrary sequence of 2n moves (with n H's and n M's) and then the digits are taken from left to right, and the digit is appended to the current player's number.\n\n Therefore, the total prize is:\n   S1 = the number formed by the digits taken by H (in the order of occurrence in A)\n   S2 = the number formed by the digits taken by M (in the order of occurrence in A)\n\n And we want to maximize S1 + S2.\n\n However, note: the digits are fixed and the order of taking is fixed (from left to right). But the assignment to H or M is arbitrary (subject to having n each).\n\n But wait: the problem does not specify that the players must alternate. So we can assign arbitrarily.\n\n But note: the example \"9911\" gives \"HMHM\". Why not \"HHMM\" for the same reason as above? Let's compute:\n\n For A = \"9911\", n=2.\n\n Option 1: \"HHMM\" -> \n   H takes '9', then H takes '9', then M takes '1', then M takes '1'.\n   S1 = 99, S2 = 11 -> total = 110.\n\n Option",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total prize for two players, Homer and Marge, who take turns selecting digits from a given number A. The total prize is the sum of the numbers formed by each player's selected digits. The challenge is to determine the optimal sequence of moves (a string of 'H' and 'M' characters) such that each player makes exactly n moves, and the sum of their numbers is maximized.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the digits are taken in order from left to right, but the assignment to players can be arbitrary (as long as each player gets exactly n digits). The goal is to assign digits to players in such a way that the sum of the numbers they form is maximized.\n2. **Insight**: To maximize the sum, we should prioritize assigning larger digits to players earlier in the sequence. However, since the digits are fixed in order, we need to decide which player takes which digit at each step.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use dynamic programming (DP) to explore all possible sequences of assignments. The DP state tracks the current position in the digit string, the number of digits each player has taken so far, and the current values of the numbers being formed. However, given the constraints (n ≤ 18), a brute-force approach might be feasible, but DP is more efficient.\n4. **Optimization**: The DP approach involves:\n   - **State**: `dp[i][j]` where `i` is the current position in the digit string, `j` is the number of digits Homer has taken, and `dp[i][j]` stores the maximum possible value of the remaining digits when considering the subproblem starting at position `i` with Homer having `j` digits.\n   - **Transition**: At each step, we decide whether the current digit should go to Homer or Marge, updating the state accordingly.\n5. **Reconstruction**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from the end to reconstruct the optimal sequence of moves (H or M) that achieves the maximum sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A = data[1].strip()\n    total_digits = 2 * n\n\n    dp = [[-1] * (n + 1) for _ in range(total_digits + 1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 0\n\n    for i in range(0, total_digits):\n        for j in range(0, n + 1):\n            if dp[i][j] == -1:\n                continue\n            if j < n:\n                num1 = int(A[i:i+1])\n                new_value = dp[i][j] + num1 * (10 ** (total_digits - i - 1))\n                if new_value > dp[i+1][j+1]:\n                    dp[i+1][j+1] = new_value\n            if i + 1 < total_digits:\n                num2 = int(A[i:i+2])\n                new_value = dp[i][j] + num2 * (10 ** (total_digits - i - 2))\n                if new_value > dp[i+2][j]:\n                    dp[i+2][j] = new_value\n\n    seq = []\n    pos = total_digits\n    count_homer = n\n    while pos > 0:\n        found = False\n        for step_back in [1, 2]:\n            if step_back == 1:\n                if pos >= 1 and dp[pos-1][count_homer] != -1:\n                    seq.append('H')\n                    pos -= 1\n                    count_homer -= 1\n                    found = True\n                    break\n            else:\n                if pos >= 2 and dp[pos-2][count_homer] != -1:\n                    seq.append('M')\n                    pos -= 2\n                    found = True\n                    break\n        if not found:\n            seq.append('H')\n            pos -= 1\n            count_homer -= 1\n\n    result = ''.join(seq[::-1])\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input values for `n` and the digit string `A`. It initializes a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will store the maximum value achievable from the first `i` digits with Homer having taken `j` digits.\n2. **DP Table Filling**: The DP table is filled by iterating over each digit position and each possible count of digits taken by Homer. For each state, the algorithm considers assigning the current digit to Homer or Marge, updating the DP table based on the resulting values.\n3. **Backtracking**: After filling the DP table, the solution backtracks from the end of the string to the beginning to determine the optimal sequence of moves. At each step, it checks whether moving one or two digits (depending on the player) leads to a valid state and appends the corresponding move to the result sequence.\n4. **Output**: The reconstructed sequence is reversed to present the moves in the correct order and printed as the solution.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible sequences using dynamic programming and ensures the optimal solution is found by leveraging backtracking to reconstruct the path taken during the DP computation.",
