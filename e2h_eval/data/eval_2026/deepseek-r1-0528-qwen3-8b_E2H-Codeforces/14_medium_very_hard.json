He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeros is determined by the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of n!.\n\n The function for the number of trailing zeros in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n However, the problem asks: for a given m (number of trailing zeros), how many positive integers n have Z(n) = m?\n\n But note: the factorial function is strictly increasing, so Z(n) is non-decreasing. However, for consecutive n, Z(n) remains the same for a while and then jumps.\n\n Observation:\n Let f(n) = Z(n). Then, we are to find all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n However, note that the same m might appear for multiple consecutive n? Actually, no: once we pass a multiple of 5, we get an extra zero. But note: the zeros accumulate only at multiples of 5. However, the zeros for n! is a step function that increases at multiples of 5.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that the factorial has exactly m zeros and then the next one has more. We need to find all n such that the number of trailing zeros is exactly m.\n\n Example: m=1 -> n=5,6,7,8,9 (because 5! has 1 zero, and 6! to 9! still have 1 zero, then 10! has 2 zeros).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We cannot iterate from n=1 to a very large number because m can be up to 100000.\n\n 2. We need to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m, and then the largest n such that Z(n) <= m? Actually, we want n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n 3. Alternatively, we can find:\n    - The smallest n such that Z(n) >= m (let's call it low)\n    - The smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1 (let's call it high)\n\n Then, the numbers n that have exactly m zeros are from [low] to [high-1]? But wait: what if there are gaps? Actually, the function Z(n) is non-decreasing and the increments happen in steps. So the set of n with Z(n)=m is the set of integers from the first n0 where Z(n0)=m to the last n1 where Z(n1)=m, and then at n1+1, Z(n1+1) becomes m+1 or more.\n\n However, note that sometimes the jump is more than one? Actually, no: the function Z(n) increases by the number of prime factors 5 added when going from n to n+1. But the jump from n to n+1 can only add one 5 (if n+1 is divisible by 5 but not 25, then one more; if divisible by 25 but not 125, then two more, etc.). But note that the jump is the number of times 5 divides (n+1). However, the jump is at least 1 and at most (the exponent of 5 in (n+1)).\n\n But importantly, the function Z(n) is non-decreasing and the set of n with Z(n)=m is contiguous.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"exactly m\". So we are looking for n such that Z(n)=m.\n\n How to compute the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m?\n   We can use binary search to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n\n Similarly, we can find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1.\n\n Then, the numbers n with Z(n)=m are the integers from (smallest n such that Z(n) >= m) to (smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1) minus one.\n\n But note: what if there is no n with Z(n)=m? Then the smallest n for m+1 might be the same as the smallest n for m? Actually, we must have a contiguous range.\n\n However, consider: m=0. Then we would look for n such that Z(n)=0. Then the smallest n with Z(n)>=0 is n=1 (since Z(0)=0 but we are considering positive integers, so n>=1). Then the next is the smallest n such that Z(n)>=1 is n=5. So the n with Z(n)=0 are n=1,2,3,4.\n\n But our input m is at least 1 (from 1 to 100000). So we don't have to handle m=0.\n\n However, the problem states: m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000). So we only deal with m>=1.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m. Call this L.\n   Step 2: Find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1. Call this R.\n\n   Then, the numbers n with Z(n)=m are from L to R-1 (inclusive). The count is R - L.\n\n   Then output:\n        k = R - L\n        then the k integers: L, L+1, ..., R-1\n\n But wait: is it guaranteed that the set of n with Z(n)=m is contiguous? Yes, because Z(n) is non-decreasing and increases only when n is a multiple of 5 (or higher powers). And once we hit a multiple of 5, we jump by at least one. So between L and R-1, every n will have Z(n)=m.\n\n However, let's test with m=1:\n\n   Find L: smallest n with Z(n)>=1 -> n=5 (since Z(4)=0, Z(5)=1).\n   Find R: smallest n with Z(n)>=2 -> n=10 (since Z(9)=1, Z(10)=2).\n\n   Then the n's are from 5 to 9 -> [5,6,7,8,9] -> 5 numbers.\n\n   Output: \n        First line: 5\n        Second line: 5 6 7 8 9\n\n   This matches the example.\n\n   Another test: m=2\n\n   Z(10)=2, Z(11)=2, Z(12)=2, Z(13)=2, Z(14)=2, Z(15)=2 (because 15//5 + 15//25 = 3+0=3 -> wait, no: 15//5=3, 15//25=0, so Z(15)=3. So actually, at n=15, we get 3 zeros.\n\n   Correction: \n        Z(10)=2, Z(11)=2, Z(12)=2, Z(13)=2, Z(14)=2, Z(15)=3.\n\n   Then for m=2, the n's are from 10 to 14.\n\n   How to compute L for m=2: smallest n such that Z(n)>=2 -> n=10 (Z(9)=1, Z(10)=2)\n   How to compute R for m=2: smallest n such that Z(n)>=3 -> n=15 (Z(14)=2, Z(15)=3)\n\n   Then the numbers are 10,11,12,13,14 -> 5 numbers.\n\n   So the count is 5.\n\n   But wait: is there a case when the set of n with Z(n)=m is empty? \n\n   For m=100000, we need to find the smallest n such that Z(n)>=100000. Then the smallest n such that Z(n)>=100001. \n\n   However, note: the problem says m is between 1 and 100000, so we are guaranteed that at least one n exists (because for example, n=5*m has Z(n) >= m). Actually, we know that Z(5*m) >= m (since 5*m//5 = m, and then there are higher terms, so Z(5*m) >= m). So for m in [1,100000], we are safe.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the function Z(n) is defined as the sum of floor(n/5^k) for k=1,2,... until 5^k > n.\n\n   We need an efficient way to compute Z(n) and then do two binary searches.\n\n   How to compute Z(n) quickly?\n\n        def trailing_zeros(n):\n            count = 0\n            divisor = 5\n            while divisor <= n:\n                count += n // divisor\n                divisor *= 5\n\n   This function runs in O(log_5(n)), which is acceptable even for n up to around 500000 (since 5^10 is 9765625, which is about 10^7, and m is 100000, so n might be up to maybe 400000? Actually, we can estimate:\n\n        We need n such that Z(n) >= 100000.\n\n        Z(n) ~ n/4 (actually, the series is geometric: n/5 + n/25 + ... = n/(5-1)*(1- (1/5)^infinite) but approximately n/4).\n\n        So n should be about 400000 to get 100000 zeros? \n\n        Let me check: \n            n = 400000 -> \n                400000//5 = 80000\n                400000//25 = 16000\n                400000//125 = 3200\n                400000//625 = 640\n                400000//3125 = 128\n                400000//15625 = 25\n                400000//78125 = 5\n                400000//390625 = 1\n                Total = 80000+16000+3200+640+128+25+5+1 = 100000-1? Let me compute:\n\n                80000\n                +16000 -> 96000\n                +3200 -> 99200\n                +640 -> 99840\n                +128 -> 99968\n                +25 -> 99993\n                +5 -> 99998\n                +1 -> 99999\n\n            So 400000 gives 99999. Then we need 100000, so n must be at least 400000+1? But wait, 400000 has 99999, so we need to go to the next multiple.\n\n            Actually, the next multiple of 5 is 400000 itself is already considered. We need to find the minimal n such that Z(n)>=100000.\n\n            We can use binary search for n from 0 to 500000 (or maybe 500000 is safe because 500000//5 = 100000, then 500000//25=20000, so total is 120000, so we can set hi to 500000).\n\n   Algorithm for binary search:\n\n        We want to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n\n        low = 0, high = 500000 (for m=100000, we know n must be at most 500000? Actually, we can set high to something else: since Z(n) is roughly n/4, then n is about 4*m. But m can be 100000, so n is about 400000. But we did see that 400000 gives 99999, so we might set high to 500000 or 400000*5? Actually, we can set high to 5*m (or 5*m is an upper bound? Because Z(5*m) >= m, so we can set high = 5*m? But wait, for m=100000, 5*m=500000, and we saw that 400000 is less than 500000 and gives 99999, so we need to go beyond 400000. But 500000 is 5*m, and Z(500000) = 100000 + 20000 + 4000 + 800 + ... which is much more than 100000.\n\n        Alternatively, we can set high to 5*m, because we know that Z(5*m) >= m (since 5*m//5 = m, then adding the rest). But is 5*m enough? Actually, we might need to go beyond 5*m because sometimes we might have skipped some zeros? No, because Z(5*m) is definitely >= m (at least m from the first term). So we can set high = 5*m.\n\n        But wait, m can be up to 100000, then 5*m is 500000, which is acceptable.\n\n        However, note: the problem says m from 1 to 100000, so 5*m is 500000, and our Z(n) function for n=500000 is:\n\n            Z(500000) = 500000//5 + 500000//25 + ... \n            = 100000 + 20000 + 4000 + 800 + 160 + 32 + 6 + 1 = 124999\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          def trailing_zeros(n):\n              count = 0\n              d = 5\n              while d <= n:\n                  count += n // d\n                  d *= 5\n              return count\n\n          def find_min_for_m(m):\n              lo = 0\n              hi = 5 * m   # because Z(5*m) >= m, so the answer is at most 5*m\n              while lo < hi:\n                  mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n                  if trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n                      lo = mid + 1\n                  else:\n                      hi = mid\n              return lo\n\n          Then, let L = find_min_for_m(m)\n          Let R = find_min_for_m(m+1)\n\n          Then, the numbers are from L to R-1.\n\n          Count = R - L\n\n          Then output:\n              print(count)\n              if count > 0:\n                  # Print the numbers from L to R-1\n                  # But note: if count is large (like up to 5, as in the examples) then we can print them in one line separated by spaces.\n                  # However, what if there are many? The problem says m up to 100000, then the numbers n with Z(n)=m might be up to 5 numbers (because the function Z(n) increases by at least one at multiples of 5, and sometimes more). Actually, the maximum consecutive n with the same Z(n) is 4? (like from 5 to 9, then 10 to 14, then 15 to 19, then 20 to 24, etc.) So at most 5 numbers.\n\n          Why 5? Because after a multiple of 5, the next four numbers (until the next multiple of 5) will have the same number of zeros.\n\n          Therefore, the set of n for a fixed m is at most 5 consecutive numbers.\n\n          So we can safely output:\n\n              print(count)\n              if count == 0:\n                  # Then we don't print the second line? But the problem says: \"Then print these k integers\", so if k==0 then we just output 0 and nothing else?\n                  # Actually, the problem says: First print k, then print the k integers. So if k==0, we just print 0 and then nothing (but the example output for m=5 would be 0, and then nothing? Actually, the example input '5' is not provided, but the sample input was '1'.)\n\n          However, note: the problem says m from 1 to 100000. Is it possible that for some m, there is no n? Actually, no. Because we know that Z(n) is non-decreasing and we have defined the boundaries.\n\n          But wait: what if m is very large? Our binary search goes from 0 to 5*m, and we know that Z(5*m) >= m (so we will always find an n). Then the set of n for each m is non-empty? Actually, no: for example, m=0 is handled by n=1 to 4, but m>=1. \n\n          However, consider m=1: we have n=5 to 9.\n\n          But note: the problem says m from 1 to 100000, so we are guaranteed that there is at least one n (because for example, n=5*m0, and we know that Z(5*m0) >= m0, so for m0=m, we have Z(5*m) >= m, and then we also have the numbers from 5*m down to ... until the previous jump? Actually, we are guaranteed that the set is non-empty.\n\n          However, wait: what if m is too large such that 5*m is the minimal n with Z(n)>=m, but then the next m+1 requires an n that is beyond the maximum n we consider? Actually, we set hi to 5*(m+1) for the second binary search. But m is up to 100000, then 5*(m+1)=500005, which is acceptable.\n\n          But note: the problem says m from 1 to 100000, and the set of n with Z(n)=m is always contiguous and non-empty? Actually, yes, because we know that Z(n) increases without bound as n increases, and it is non-decreasing. Also, for any m, there is an n such that Z(n)=m (unless m is too large and there is a gap, but note: the zeros increase by at least one at multiples of 5, and sometimes more. However, the set of zeros is every integer from 0 to infinity? Actually, no: we can skip some values of zeros? \n\n          Example: \n            n=24: Z(24)=4 (because 24//5 + 24//25 = 4+0=4)\n            n=25: Z(25)=6 (because 25//5=5, 25//25=1 -> 6)\n\n          So we skipped 5. Therefore, for m=5, there is no n such that Z(n)=5.\n\n          Then our method:\n\n            We are finding the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m (for m=5) -> that n is 25 (because Z(24)=4, Z(25)=6). Then the smallest n such that Z(n)>=6 is 25. Then the set of n with Z(n)=5 is empty.\n\n          Therefore, the code must account for that.\n\n          Then, the output for m=5 would be:\n\n            First line: 0\n\n          And then nothing.\n\n          But wait, the problem says: \"First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\"\n\n          So if k=0, we just print 0 and then stop. We don't print the integers.\n\n          However, the example input ['1','5'] is given, but note: the example input is actually:\n\n            Input: '1' (which is the sample) and then another sample input is '5' (which is the other example).\n\n          The example output for input '5' is:\n\n            ['0']\n\n          But wait, the example output format is:\n\n            First sample: \n                Input: 1\n                Output: \n                    5\n                    5 6 7 8 9\n\n            Second sample: \n                Input: 5\n                Output: 0\n\n          However, the example output is given as: \n                ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n          Actually, the second sample output is just the string \"0\", meaning that we output the integer 0 and then nothing.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"First print k\", so for m=5, k=0.\n\n          Therefore, we must adjust: the set of n with Z(n)=m might be empty.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Compute L = smallest n with Z(n)>=m.\n            Compute R = smallest n with Z(n)>=m+1.\n\n            Then, if Z(L) != m, then there is no n with Z(n)=m? Actually, no: because Z(n) is non-decreasing and we know that Z(L)=m or Z(L)=m+something? Actually, by definition, L is the smallest n such that Z(n)>=m. Then:\n\n                If Z(L) == m, then the set of n with Z(n)=m starts at L and goes until the next jump (which is R-1).\n\n                But if Z(L) > m, then there is no n with Z(n)=m? \n\n            Example: m=5. \n                L = smallest n with Z(n)>=5 -> that is 25, because Z(24)=4, Z(25)=6. So Z(L)=6>5.\n\n            Then, the set of n with Z(n)=5 is empty.\n\n            How do we know that? Because if Z(L) > m, then there is no n with Z(n)=m, because the smallest n that reaches at least m is already above m.\n\n            But note: the function Z(n) is non-decreasing and integer-valued. So if Z(L) > m, then there is no n with Z(n)=m.\n\n            However, what if we have a jump from 4 to 6? Then 5 is skipped.\n\n            Therefore, we must check: \n\n                If the minimal n such that Z(n)>=m has Z(n) > m, then the set is empty.\n\n            Alternatively, we can check: if Z(L) != m, then there is no n with Z(n)=m.\n\n            But note: we don't know if Z(L) is exactly m or greater. \n\n            However, we can define:\n\n                Let L = find_min_for_m(m)\n\n                Then, if Z(L) != m, then the set is empty.\n\n            But wait, is that always true? \n\n                We know that Z(L) >= m, and if Z(L) > m, then there is no n with Z(n)=m.\n\n                But if Z(L) == m, then the set is [L, R-1].\n\n            However, consider: what if there are multiple jumps? Actually, the set of n with Z(n)=m is contiguous if m is present, and if m is skipped then the set is empty.\n\n            So:\n\n                if Z(L) > m:\n                    k = 0\n                else:\n                    k = R - L   # because R is the smallest n such that Z(n)>=m+1, and Z(L)=m, so from L to R-1, Z(n)=m.\n\n            But wait: how do we know that Z(L)=m? \n\n                Actually, L is the smallest n such that Z(n)>=m. Then, if there is an n0 < L such that Z(n0)=m, then L wouldn't be the smallest. But note: we are searching for the smallest n with Z(n)>=m. It is possible that Z(L)=m, but also it is possible that Z(L)>m (if there's a jump over m).\n\n            Example: m=5, then L=25, and Z(25)=6>5.\n\n            Now, what if m=6?\n\n                Then L = smallest n with Z(n)>=6 -> n=25, because Z(24)=4, Z(25)=6. Then Z(L)=6, so we have n from 25 to R-1.\n\n                What is R? smallest n with Z(n)>=7 -> n=30? Let's check:\n\n                    Z(25)=6, Z(26)=6, Z(27)=6, Z(28)=6, Z(29)=6, Z(30)=7 (since 30//5=6, 30//25=1 -> total 7).\n\n                So the set for m=6 is [25,29] -> 5 numbers.\n\n            Therefore, we can write:\n\n                L = find_min_for_m(m)\n                if trailing_zeros(L) != m:\n                    print(0)\n                else:\n                    R = find_min_for_m(m+1)\n                    k = R - L\n                    print(k)\n                    if k > 0:\n                        # Format the numbers from L to R-1\n                        # Since k is at most 5, we can do:\n                        #   print(\" \".join(str(i) for i in range(L, R)))\n                        pass\n\n            But wait: why is k at most 5? Because the next jump (to m+1) occurs at most 5 steps away? Actually, the next jump occurs at the next multiple of 5. However, sometimes the jump is more than one (like from 24 to 25: jump from 4 to 6). But the next jump (for m) is the next time we add a factor of 5. The gap between two consecutive n that have the same Z(n) is at most 4. Therefore, the set of n with Z(n)=m is at most 5 consecutive numbers.\n\n            However, note: the jump from n to n+1 is by the number of factors of 5 in (n+1). But the next jump (from m to m+1 or more) happens at the next multiple of 5. So the length of the interval [L, R-1] is (R - L). And R is the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1. The difference R-L is the number of consecutive n that have Z(n)=m.\n\n            Since the zeros increase only when n is a multiple of 5, and the zeros can jump by more than one, but the zeros remain constant for 4 numbers (from a multiple of 5 to the next multiple of 5 minus one). However, if we start at L (which is a multiple of 5) then we have:\n\n                L, L+1, L+2, L+3, L+4 (if the next multiple of 5 is L+5, then at L+5 the zeros jump again).\n\n            Actually, the zeros remain the same until the next multiple of 5. So the set of n with Z(n)=m is from L to (the next multiple of 5 that causes the jump to m+1 or more) minus one.\n\n            But note: L is defined as the smallest n with Z(n)>=m. It might not be a multiple of 5? Actually, the zeros only change at multiples of 5, so the minimal n with Z(n)>=m must be a multiple of 5? Not necessarily: \n\n                Example: m=1, then L=5 (multiple of 5). \n                m=2, then L=10 (multiple of 5).\n                m=3, then L=15 (multiple of 5)? But wait, Z(15)=3, and Z(14)=2, so yes.\n\n            Actually, the zeros only change at multiples of 5, so the minimal n for which Z(n)>=m must be a multiple of 5. Why? Because if n is not a multiple of 5, then Z(n) = Z(n-1). And if n-1 was the last multiple of 5, then Z(n) = Z(n-1) until the next multiple of 5. Therefore, the minimal n is the next multiple of 5 that pushes the zeros to at least m.\n\n            However, wait: what if m=0? Then the minimal n is 1, which is not a multiple of 5. But m>=1, so we are safe.\n\n            But wait, consider m=6: \n                Z(24)=4, Z(25)=6 -> so the minimal n for m=6 is 25 (a multiple of 5).\n\n            Therefore, we can assume that L is a multiple of 5.\n\n            Then, the set of n with Z(n)=m is the numbers from L to (the next multiple of 5 that causes an additional zero) minus one, unless the zeros jump more than one? Actually, the zeros jump by the exponent of 5 in n. But the next jump (when we hit the next multiple of 5) might be more than one.\n\n            However, note: the next jump (to get to m+1) is at the next multiple of 5. But wait: what if we have a multiple of 25? Then the jump at that point is 2 (for example, from 24 to 25: adds two zeros because 25=5^2). Then the zeros go from 4 to 6, skipping 5.\n\n            But in our method, we are using:\n\n                L = smallest n with Z(n)>=m\n                R = smallest n with Z(n)>=m+1\n\n            Then the set is [L, R-1]. This works regardless of the jump size.\n\n            Example: m=5, then L=25, R=30 (because Z(25)=6, so the smallest n with Z(n)>=6 is 25, and the smallest n with Z(n)>=7 is 30). Then the set for m=5 is [25,29] (but wait, Z(25)=6, Z(26)=6, Z(27)=6, Z(28)=6, Z(29)=6, Z(30)=7). So the set for m=5 is empty because we are looking for Z(n)=5, but Z(25)=6. \n\n            But wait, our condition is: if Z(L) != m, then output 0. For m=5, Z(L)=6 !=5, so output 0.\n\n            Example: m=6, then L=25 (Z(25)=6, so we use L=25) and then R = smallest n with Z(n)>=7 -> 30. Then the set is [25,29] (5 numbers).\n\n            Example: m=7, then L= smallest n with Z(n)>=7 -> 30 (because Z(29)=6, Z(30)=7). Then R = smallest n with Z(n)>=8 -> 35 (Z(34)=7, Z(35)=8). Then the set is [30,34] (5 numbers).\n\n            Example: m=8, then L=35 (Z(35)=8) and R= smallest n with Z(n)>=9 -> 40 (Z(39)=8, Z(40)=9). Then [35,39] (5 numbers).\n\n            Example: m=9, then L=40 (Z(40)=9) and R= smallest n with Z(n)>=10 -> 45 (Z(44)=9, Z(45)=10). Then [40,44] (5 numbers).\n\n            Example: m=10, then L=45 (Z(45)=10) and R= smallest n with Z(n)>=11 -> 50 (Z(49)=10, Z(50)=11). Then [45,49] (5 numbers).\n\n            Example: m=11, then L=50 (Z(50)=11) and R= smallest n with Z(n)>=12 -> 55 (Z(54)=11, Z(55)=12). Then [50,54] (5 numbers).\n\n            But wait, what about m=4? \n\n                m=4: \n                    L: smallest n with Z(n)>=4 -> 20 (Z(19)=3, Z(20)=4)\n                    R: smallest n with Z(n)>=5 -> 25 (Z(24)=4, Z(25)=6) -> wait, Z(24)=4, so the smallest n with Z(n)>=5 is 25 (because 24 has 4, which is less than 5). Then the set is [20,24] (5 numbers). But wait, Z(20)=4, Z(21)=4, Z(22)=4, Z(23)=4, Z(24)=4. Then the set is 5 numbers.\n\n            However, note: for m=4, we have n from 20 to 24. That's correct.\n\n            But what about m=6? We did: [25,29] -> 5 numbers.\n\n            Now, consider m=0: not applicable.\n\n            But wait: what if m=1? Then [5,9] -> 5 numbers.\n\n            So the set for each m (that is present) has 5 numbers. But wait, what if m is very large and the next jump is more than one? \n\n            Example: m=12, then L=55 (Z(55)=12) and R= smallest n with Z(n)>=13 -> 60 (Z(59)=12, Z(60)=13). Then [55,59] (5 numbers).\n\n            Example: m=13, then L=60 (Z(60)=13) and R= smallest n with Z(n)>=14 -> 65 (Z(64)=13, Z(65)=14). Then [60,64] (5 numbers).\n\n            Example: m=14, then L=65 (Z(65)=14) and R= smallest n with Z(n)>=15 -> 70 (Z(69)=14, Z(70)=15). Then [65,69] (5 numbers).\n\n            Example: m=15, then L=70 (Z(70)=15) and R= smallest n with Z(n)>=16 -> 75 (Z(74)=15, Z(75)=16). Then [70,74] (5 numbers).\n\n            Example: m=16, then L=75 (Z(75)=16) and R= smallest n with Z(n)>=17 -> 80 (Z(79)=16, Z(80)=17). Then [75,79] (5 numbers).\n\n            Example: m=17, then L=80 (Z(80)=17) and R= smallest n with Z(n)>=18 -> 85 (Z(84)=17, Z(85)=18). Then [80,84] (5 numbers).\n\n            Example: m=18, then L=85 (Z(85)=18) and R= smallest n with Z(n)>=19 -> 90 (Z(89)=18, Z(90)=19). Then [85,89] (5 numbers).\n\n            Example: m=19, then L=90 (Z(90)=19) and R= smallest n with Z(n)>=20 -> 95 (Z(94)=19, Z(95)=20). Then [90,94] (5 numbers).\n\n            Example: m=20, then L=95 (Z(95)=20) and R= smallest n with Z(n)>=21 -> 100 (Z(99)=20, Z(100)=21). Then [95,99] (5 numbers).\n\n            But wait, what about the jump at 10",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding all such \\( n \\) values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of the primes 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is dictated by the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of \\( n! \\). This count is calculated as \\( Z(n) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5^k} \\right\\rfloor \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest integer \\( L \\) such that \\( Z(L) \\geq m \\). Similarly, we find the smallest integer \\( R \\) such that \\( Z(R) \\geq m + 1 \\). The integers \\( n \\) that satisfy \\( Z(n) = m \\) lie in the range \\([L, R - 1]\\), provided \\( Z(L) = m \\). If \\( Z(L) > m \\), no such \\( n \\) exists.\n\n3. **Efficiency Consideration**: The binary search efficiently narrows down the range for \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) by leveraging the properties of \\( Z(n) \\), which increases monotonically. The function \\( trailing\\_zeros(n) \\) computes the count in logarithmic time relative to \\( n \\), making the overall approach feasible even for large \\( m \\) (up to 100,000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    d = 5\n    while d <= n:\n        count += n // d\n        d *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_for_m(m):\n    lo = 0\n    hi = 5 * m\n    while lo < hi:\n        mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n        if trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            lo = mid + 1\n        else:\n            hi = mid\n    return lo\n\ndef main():\n    m_val = int(input().strip())\n    L = find_min_for_m(m_val)\n    zeros_at_L = trailing_zeros(L)\n    if zeros_at_L != m_val:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        R = find_min_for_m(m_val + 1)\n        k = R - L\n        print(k)\n        if k > 0:\n            numbers = list(range(L, R))\n            print(\" \".join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **trailing_zeros(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the divisor exceeds \\( n \\).\n\n2. **find_min_for_m(m)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\). The search space is between 0 and \\( 5 \\times m \\), ensuring efficiency.\n\n3. **main()**: The main function reads the input \\( m \\), computes \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) using `find_min_for_m`, checks if \\( Z(L) = m \\). If not, it prints 0. Otherwise, it calculates the count of valid \\( n \\) values (from \\( L \\) to \\( R - 1 \\)) and prints them in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints by leveraging binary search and mathematical insights about factorial trailing zeroes, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of \\( m \\).",
