Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from standard input.\n The idea is:\n 1. Combine the first two strings (guest name and host name) and count the total frequency of each letter.\n 2. Compare the frequency of letters in the third string (the pile) with the combined frequency of the first two.\n 3. If the two frequencies match exactly, then we output \"YES\", otherwise \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the problem says that there should be no extra letters and no missing letters.\n\n Steps:\n - Read the three lines and strip any newline characters.\n - Concatenate the first two strings to form the target string.\n - Count the frequency of each character in the target string and in the third string.\n - If the frequency counts for all letters are the same, then it's YES, else NO.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   The target string is \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\". \n   The pile string is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   We can count the letters in the target and the pile and compare.\n\n But note: the example input has multiple test cases? Actually, the example provided is a list of three different inputs and expected outputs.\n\n However, looking at the example input format:\n\n    ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n This seems to be a list of three test cases, but the problem says the input file consists of three lines.\n\n Actually, the problem states:\n\n    The input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning.\n\n So, we are reading three lines.\n\n But the example provided in the problem is one example with three test cases? \n\n Let me clarify: the example input is given as:\n\n    ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n However, the problem says the input file has three lines. This example is just showing three different examples.\n\n Since the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", and the example input is given as a list of three strings, but actually the input is three lines, we must read three lines.\n\n But wait, the example output is also given as a list: ['YES','NO','NO'].\n\n Actually, I think the example is providing three separate examples. However, the problem expects a single run that reads three lines and outputs one answer.\n\n But the problem statement says: \"Print \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names... Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\"\n\n And the example input has three lines, so we are to process one set of three lines per run.\n\n However, the example provided in the problem is three separate test cases. But the input format is one test case per program run? \n\n Clarification: The input file has three lines. So we are to read three lines and check for that.\n\n But note: the example input string is given as a list of three strings, meaning that the example might be intended to be run three times with one test case each, or the example input is one file with three test cases?\n\n Actually, the problem does not specify multiple test cases. It says \"The input file consists of three lines\".\n\n Therefore, we assume one test case per execution.\n\n However, the example output is given as a list of three answers. But that is just an example of multiple test cases? \n\n Let me re-read: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the example input and output.\n\n But the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\".\n\n So, we write code that reads three lines.\n\n But the sample input they gave is:\n\n    ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]   -> this is a representation of three lines.\n\n How the actual input would look? \n\n Example 1:\n\n    Input:\n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n    Output:\n        YES\n\n Example 2:\n\n    Input:\n        PAPAINOEL\n        JOULUPUKKI\n        JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n    Output:\n        NO\n\n Example 3:\n\n    Input:\n        BABBONATALE\n        FATHERCHRISTMAS\n        BABCHRISTMASBON",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves comparing the frequency of each letter in the combined names with the frequency of letters in the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Inputs**: The first two lines are the guest's name and the host's name, respectively. The third line is the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Count Letters**: Use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each letter in the combined names and separately in the pile.\n4. **Compare Counts**: If the counts of all letters match exactly between the combined names and the pile, output \"YES\"; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    guest = input().strip()\n    host = input().strip()\n    pile = input().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    counter_combined = Counter(combined)\n    counter_pile = Counter(pile)\n    \n    if counter_combined == counter_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Inputs**: The code reads three lines from standard input: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's name and host's name are concatenated into a single string to form the combined letters required.\n3. **Counting Letters**: The `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to count the occurrences of each letter in both the combined string and the pile.\n4. **Comparison**: The counts from the combined string and the pile are compared. If they match exactly, it means the pile contains exactly the same letters as the combined names, just possibly in a different order, so the answer is \"YES\". Otherwise, the answer is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match in letter frequencies, ensuring that no extra letters are present and all required letters are accounted for. The use of `Counter` simplifies the counting process and makes the solution concise and readable.",
