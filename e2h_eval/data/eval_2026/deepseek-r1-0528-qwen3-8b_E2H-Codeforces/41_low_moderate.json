There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given n, h, m and then m lines of restrictions [l_i, r_i, x_i]\n Since n, m, h are at most 50, we can use dynamic programming or try to assign heights satisfying all constraints.\n\n However, note: the profit function is a^2 for each house. The goal is to maximize the total profit.\n\n The challenge is that the restrictions impose that in some intervals the maximum height is bounded by x_i.\n\n Observation:\n Since the constraints are independent and the objective is separable (each house's profit depends only on its own height), \n we can think of assigning a height to each spot such that for every restriction (l, r, x): \n   the maximum height in the interval [l, r] is <= x.\n\n But note: we have multiple restrictions that might overlap.\n\n Approach:\n We can consider using DP with state as (position, current height) but then how to incorporate the restrictions?\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute the restrictions and then use a constraint satisfaction. However, the problem is small (n=50, h=50) but the state space (if we do DP over positions and last height) would be 50*51 which is 2550 states, but then we must check all restrictions for each state? That might be too heavy if we check all m restrictions (m<=50) for each state.\n\n But note: we have to satisfy all restrictions. The restrictions say that in a particular interval the maximum is at most x_i.\n\n However, we can also think: the entire assignment must satisfy that for each restriction j, the maximum in [l_j, r_j] <= x_j.\n\n Another idea: use the fact that the profit is quadratic and the constraints are linear (in terms of maximums). We can use a greedy or linear programming like method? But note: n, m, h are small (<=50) but we cannot iterate over 50^50 possibilities.\n\n Alternatively, we can use iterative constraint propagation. But note: the problem is small enough that we might use state space search with memoization and then enforce the constraints.\n\n However, there is a better way: since the profit function is separable and the constraints are about maximums, we can use an approach that sets the height for each spot independently but with the condition that no spot exceeds the minimum x_i from any restriction that covers it.\n\n But wait: the restrictions are not independent. One restriction might force a whole interval to be low, and another might force a different part.\n\n Steps:\n\n Idea 1: Precompute for each spot i, the minimal maximum allowed by the restrictions that cover it. However, note: the restrictions are on contiguous intervals and we have multiple restrictions. Actually, for each spot i, we can compute:\n   Let A[i] = min{ x_j | there exists a restriction j such that l_j <= i <= r_j }   ... but wait, that's not correct because one restriction might only require the entire interval [l_j, r_j] to have maximum <= x_j, but if we set each house to the minimum x_j that covers it, then we might break the requirement for an interval: because the requirement for an interval [l_j, r_j] is that the maximum in that interval is <= x_j, so if we set each house to the minimum x_j that covers it, then the maximum in the interval [l_j, r_j] would be at most x_j (since each house is at most the x_j that applies to it, and note that x_j is the maximum allowed for the entire interval). \n\n However, consider two restrictions: \n   Restriction 1: [1,3] <= 5\n   Restriction 2: [2,4] <= 3\n\n Then for house 2: the minimum x_j is min(5,3)=3. Similarly house 3: min(5,3)=3. Then the entire interval [1,3] would have maximum at most 3 (from house 1: we set to min(x_j for j covering 1) -> only restriction1: 5, so house1=5; house2=3; house3=3). Then the interval [1,3] has max=5, which is allowed by restriction1 (which requires <=5) but the interval [2,4] must be <=3: house2=3, house3=3, house4=min(x_j for j covering 4: only restriction2:3) -> so house4=3, then [2,4] is [3,3,3] -> ok. But wait, house1 was set to 5, and that breaks nothing? Actually, the restriction [1,3] allows up to 5, so having 5 in house1 is ok. However, we could set house1 to a lower value (like 3",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street with specific zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses built on each spot. The constraints require that in certain intervals, the maximum height of any house within those intervals does not exceed a specified value.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves assigning heights to houses such that all zoning restrictions are satisfied. Each restriction specifies that the tallest house in a particular interval must not exceed a given height. The goal is to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of the squares of the house heights.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each house, the maximum allowable height is constrained by all restrictions that cover it. Specifically, for a house at position `i`, the maximum height it can have is the minimum of all `x_i` values from restrictions that include position `i`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Preprocessing**: For each house position, determine the minimal maximum height allowed by all relevant restrictions. This involves checking all restrictions that include the current position and selecting the smallest `x_i` among them.\n   - **Optimal Height Assignment**: Once the minimal allowable height for each house is known, the optimal height for each house is simply this minimal value, as increasing the height would increase the profit (since the profit function is quadratic), but cannot exceed the constraints.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each house and each restriction once. With `n` houses and `m` restrictions, the complexity is O(n*m), which is efficient given the constraints (n, m ≤ 50).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    h_global = int(data[1])\n    m = int(data[2])\n    \n    restrictions = []\n    index = 3\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        x_val = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        restrictions.append((l, r, x_val))\n    \n    max_heights = [h_global] * (n + 1)\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        min_val = h_global\n        for (l, r, x_val) in restrictions:\n            if l <= i <= r:\n                if x_val < min_val:\n                    min_val = x_val\n        max_heights[i] = min_val\n    \n    total_profit = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        height = max_heights[i]\n        total_profit += height * height\n    \n    print(total_profit)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of spots `n`, the global maximum height `h_global`, and the number of restrictions `m`. The restrictions are then read and stored in a list.\n2. **Determining Maximum Heights**: For each house position from 1 to `n`, the algorithm checks all restrictions to find the smallest maximum height (`x_i`) that applies to that position. This value is stored in an array `max_heights`.\n3. **Calculating Profit**: The total profit is computed by summing the squares of the heights assigned to each house, where each height is the minimal value determined earlier. This ensures compliance with all restrictions while maximizing profit.\n4. **Output**: The computed total profit is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints by leveraging preprocessing to determine allowable heights and then directly computing the profit based on these constraints. The solution is optimal and straightforward given the problem's constraints.",
