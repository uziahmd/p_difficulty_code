Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and a string A of 2n digits.\n We have two players: Homer (H) and Marge (M). Each makes exactly n moves.\n On each move, the leftmost digit is taken and appended to the respective player's number.\n\n The goal is to choose a sequence of moves (a string of length 2n containing n 'H's and n 'M's) such that the total prize (which is the value of S1 plus the value of S2) is maximized.\n\n Note: The total prize is just the numerical value of S1 plus the numerical value of S2. However, note that the numbers can have leading zeros, but in reality, we interpret the string as a base-10 number (so \"01\" is 1). But note: the problem allows leading zeros, so we must consider the entire string.\n\n How does the game work?\n   Initially, A is a string of 2n digits, and S1 and S2 are empty strings.\n   In each move, we remove the first digit of A and assign it to the current player's number.\n\n However, the catch: the players take turns and they can choose the order of moves (but each must make n moves). The sequence of moves is a permutation of n H's and n M's.\n\n But note: the move sequence must be such that the resulting numbers S1 and S2 are built by taking the digits from A in order, but only at the times when the corresponding player moves.\n\n Example: \n   Input: n=2, A=\"1234\"\n   One possible sequence: \"HHMM\": \n        First two moves: both are H -> then S1 becomes \"12\", S2 becomes \"\" (then the remaining A is \"34\")\n        Then the next two moves: both are M -> then S1 remains \"12\", and S2 becomes \"34\".\n        So the total prize = 12 + 34 = 46.\n\n   Another sequence: \"HMHM\":\n        Move1: H -> S1=\"1\", A becomes \"234\"\n        Move2: M -> S2=\"2\", A becomes \"34\"\n        Move3: H -> S1=\"13\", A becomes \"4\"\n        Move4: M -> S2=\"24\", A becomes \"\"\n        Total prize = 13 + 24 = 37.\n\n   Another sequence: \"HM HM\" is the same as above.\n\n   The example output for n=2 and A=\"9911\" is \"HMHM\".\n\n Observation:\n   The total prize is the sum of two numbers: one built from the digits assigned to H and the other to M.\n\n   Let the entire string A be d0, d1, d2, ..., d_{2n-1}.\n\n   The assignment: we will assign each digit to either H or M. The catch is that the digits are taken from the beginning of A in order. However, the assignment must be such that the relative order of the digits in each player's number is preserved (because we take from the left). But note: the digits are taken in the order of the sequence of moves.\n\n   Actually, the sequence of moves determines which digits go to which player. The i-th move (from left to right) in the sequence of moves takes the current leftmost digit (which is the original A[i] if no prior moves have taken digits from the front) and assigns it to the player whose turn it is.\n\n   Therefore, the set of digits that H gets is the ones at the positions in A where the move was H, and similarly for M. And the number S1 is built by concatenating the digits that H got in the order of the moves (which is the order of appearance in A). Similarly for S2.\n\n   However, note: the moves are interleaved. The first move takes the first digit, then the second move takes the second digit, etc. But wait: what if the moves are not in order? \n\n   Example: n=2, A=\"1234\", sequence \"HM\" for the first two moves: \n        Then H takes the first digit (1) and M takes the second digit (2). Then the remaining digits are \"34\". Then the next two moves: say \"HM\" again, then H takes the third digit (3) and M takes the fourth (4). Then S1 = \"13\", S2=\"24\".\n\n   But if the sequence is \"MH\" for the first two moves: \n        M takes the first digit (1) and H takes the second (2). Then the next two moves: if we do \"MH\", then M takes the third (3) and H takes the fourth (4). Then S1=\"24\", S2=\"13\". Then total prize = 24+13 = 37.\n\n   So the assignment of digits to players depends on the positions in A.\n\n   How to model the problem?\n\n   We are to assign each of the 2n digits to either H or M, and we know that the moves must be interleaved (each player exactly n moves). The constraint is that the digits are taken from A in order (the first move takes the first digit, the second the next, etc.) but we assign them arbitrarily to the two players.\n\n   However, note: the sequence of moves must be of length 2n, and we cannot change the order of A. The moves are defined by the sequence: at step i, we remove the first digit of the current A and assign it to the player whose turn it is.\n\n   Therefore, the digit in the j-th position of A is always available at the j-th removal (if we consider the removals in order). But the assignment to H or M is determined by the sequence.\n\n   The problem reduces to: we have 2n digits in order. We need to assign each digit to one of two players (with each player getting exactly n digits) and the assignment must be such that the digits assigned to H form a number (in the order of their occurrence in A) and similarly for M.\n\n   Then the total prize is the sum of these two numbers.\n\n   We wish to maximize that sum.\n\n   However, note: the numbers are formed by the digits in the order they are assigned (which is the same as the order in A). So if we let X be the sequence of digits assigned to H (in the order of A) and Y for M, then the total prize is int(X) + int(Y).\n\n   But note: the digits might have leading zeros. However, when we convert a string with leading zeros to an integer, it becomes the number without the leading zeros. But wait: the problem says leading zeros are allowed. However, the total prize is computed as the numerical value. \n\n   Example: if a player gets digits \"001\", then the number is 1. But note: if we break down the assignment:\n\n   We have two numbers: one is built by the digits assigned to H (in order) and the other for M.\n\n   However, there is a catch: the value of the number is determined by the base-10 interpretation. So we cannot simply compare the string lengths.\n\n   Alternate approach: dynamic programming.\n\n   Since n is at most 18, so 2n is at most 36. We cannot iterate over all sequences (C(36,18) is too big).\n\n   We need to consider the state: \n        index: the current position in A (from 0 to 2n)\n        count_H: how many moves H has made (from 0 to n)\n        count_M: how many moves M has made (from 0 to n)\n\n   But also we need to keep track of the two numbers being built? That would be too heavy because the numbers can be up to 36 digits long.\n\n   Alternatively, note: the total prize is the sum of two numbers. The digits are fixed in order, and we are assigning each digit to either H or M. The value of the number for H is:\n\n        H_value = 0\n        For each digit d_i assigned to H (at the i-th position in A), we add d_i * (10^(position weight)) ... but wait, the position in the number is determined by when the digit is assigned.\n\n   Actually, the digits assigned to a player are concatenated in the order they are taken. The first digit assigned to H becomes the most significant digit.\n\n   So if we assign the digits at positions i1, i2, ..., i_k (where k = n) to H, then the value is:\n        value_H = 0\n        for j from 0 to k-1:\n            value_H += digit_at_i_j * (10^(k-1-j))\n\n   Similarly for M.\n\n   But note: the assignment must be done in increasing order of indices (because we take from the front). So the digits are taken in order. Therefore, the positions i_j are increasing.\n\n   However, we cannot assign arbitrarily: the moves must be interleaved. The assignment must be such that the sequence of moves is a valid interleaving (i.e., we cannot assign a later digit to H before an earlier one, because the digits are removed from the front in order).\n\n   So the problem is: choose an interleaving (sequence of H and M) of length 2n with exactly n H's and n M's, and the assignment is that the first time we see an H (in the sequence) we assign the first digit to H, the first time we see an M we assign the first digit to M? Actually, no: the moves happen in the order of the sequence. The first character in the sequence is the move for the first digit, the second for the second, etc.\n\n   So we can think: we are going to split the 2n digits into two subsequences (each of length n) preserving the original order. Then the value of H is the number formed by the digits in the subsequence for H (in the order they appear) and similarly for M.\n\n   Then the total prize is the sum of these two numbers.\n\n   How to maximize that?\n\n   We want to maximize (value_H + value_M). \n\n   Since the two numbers are built from disjoint sets of digits (and together they use all digits) and the digits are in fixed order, we have to decide for each digit: whether it goes to H or M.\n\n   But note: the digits are taken in order, and the assignment must be such that the entire sequence of moves is valid (each player gets n moves).\n\n   Now, note that the total prize is independent of the interleaving? Actually, no: the value of the number depends on the position of the digit in the subsequence. For example, if a digit is assigned to H and it is the first digit in the entire A, then it is the most significant digit of H. But if we assign a digit that is more to the left to M, then it becomes the most significant digit of M.\n\n   However, we can compare two assignments: we wish to maximize the sum.\n\n   Consider: the entire set of digits is fixed. The two numbers are built from two disjoint sets. The contribution of a digit d at position i (0-indexed) is d * (10^p) where p is the power depending on how many digits are after it in the same player's number.\n\n   For example, if a digit is the first one for a player, then its power is (n-1) (if we consider the player's number has n digits, so the first digit is multiplied by 10^(n-1)). But if we assign two digits to the same player, then the power depends on the relative order within the player's subsequence.\n\n   However, note: the entire sequence of moves is fixed, and the digits assigned to a player are taken in the order they appear. So the power for a digit in a player's number is determined by how many digits (from that player) are assigned to the right of it (in A). \n\n   Let the entire A be d0, d1, ..., d_{2n-1}. Suppose we assign a digit d_i to a player. Then in the player's number, this digit will be preceded by some digits from the same player that were taken from the left part of A (i.e., from indices < i). So the power for d_i is 10^(k), where k is the number of digits from the same player that are assigned to positions j>i? No, wait: actually, the player's number is built from the digits in the order of A. So if we have a digit d_i, then in the player's number, the digits that come after d_i are the ones that are assigned to the same player and that occur later in A (i.e., at indices j>i). Therefore, the power for d_i is 10^(number_of_digits_from_this_player_among_indices_i+1_to_end).\n\n   Alternatively, if we know the entire assignment, then for H we can compute:\n\n        value_H = 0\n        Let pos0, pos1, ..., pos_{n-1} be the indices (in increasing order) of the digits assigned to H.\n        Then value_H = d_{pos0} * 10^(n-1) + d_{pos1} * 10^(n-2) + ... + d_{pos_{n-1}} * 10^0\n\n   Similarly for M.\n\n   Now, note: the entire set of digits is fixed. The two numbers are built from two sets of n digits each, and the sets are disjoint.\n\n   We wish to maximize: \n        value_H + value_M\n\n   How to do that?\n\n   We can use dynamic programming that considers:\n\n        dp[i][j] = maximum total prize we can achieve from the first i+j digits (we have processed i+j digits) with j digits assigned to H (so i = (i+j) - j = number of digits processed for M) and then we have two numbers: one for H and one for M. But the problem is that the numbers' values depend on the exact digits and their positions.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use DP that also keeps track of the two numbers. But the numbers can be very large (up to 36 digits) so we cannot store the entire number.\n\n   Another idea: since the digits are fixed and the assignment is just splitting the digits into two groups (each of size n) and then building two numbers (each of n digits) from the groups (preserving the original order), we can precompute the contribution of each digit if we knew the group and the position within the group.\n\n   But note: the position within the group is determined by the order of appearance. The first digit of A that is assigned to a player becomes the most significant.\n\n   We can consider: the entire set of digits is fixed. The total prize is:\n\n        Sum_{each digit d_i} [ d_i * (10^{power}) ]\n\n   But the power depends on the assignment and the ordering in the same player.\n\n   Let f(i, h) be the total value contributed by the digits assigned to H from the first i digits (with h being the count of H so far) and similarly for M. But then we have to combine the two.\n\n   Alternatively, note: the entire assignment is a binary string of length 2n (with n ones for H and n zeros for M). The value of the two numbers is:\n\n        Let H_digits = [d_i for i in indices where we assigned H]\n        Let M_digits = [d_i for i in indices where we assigned M]\n\n        Then value_H = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (digit * (10^(n-1-k))) \n        and similarly for M.\n\n   But note: the digits are assigned in increasing index order. So the first H digit (by index) is the most significant for H.\n\n   We can compute the total prize as:\n\n        total = 0\n        for each digit d_i, if it is assigned to H, then it contributes d_i * (10^(n - (rank_in_H))) \n        where rank_in_H is the position of d_i in the H subsequence (counting from 0 to n-1, with 0 being the most significant).\n\n   But note: the rank_in_H is the number of digits assigned to H that have index less than i? Actually, no: the rank_in_H is the number of digits assigned to H that occur at indices <= i and are in the H set, but we don't know the future. \n\n   Alternatively, we can process from left to right and assign the digit to either H or M, and then update the value accordingly.\n\n   However, the power of a digit depends on the total number of digits that will be assigned to the same player to the right (because that determines the exponent). \n\n   This is tricky because the exponent for a digit in H is (n - 1 - (number of H digits to the right of it))? \n\n   Actually, if we assign a digit at position i to H, then in the H number, the digit will be placed at a position that is determined by the total number of H digits that are at positions j>=i (including i). Specifically, the digit at i will be the (total_H_from_i_to_end)-th most significant digit in H? \n\n   But note: the entire H number has n digits, and the digits are taken from A in order. So the digit at i is the (k)-th digit of H, where k is the number of H digits from the entire A that are at positions <= i. However, we don't know the future. \n\n   Alternatively, we can think: the entire assignment is a partition. Then the value for H is:\n\n        Let the indices assigned to H be i0, i1, ..., i_{n-1} (sorted). Then \n        value_H = d_{i0} * 10^(n-1) + d_{i1} * 10^(n-2) + ... + d_{i_{n-1}} * 10^0.\n\n   Similarly for M.\n\n   Then the total prize = value_H + value_M.\n\n   We wish to maximize that.\n\n   We can use DP with state (i, j) where i is the index in A we've processed (from 0 to 2n) and j is the number of digits assigned to H so far (then M has i-j digits). Then we can define:\n\n        dp[i][j] = maximum total prize we can achieve from the first i digits (0-indexed, so i from 0 to 2n) having assigned j digits to H and i-j digits to M.\n\n   However, we need to account for the fact that the digits we assign now will be placed at a certain significance. But the significance depends on the entire set of digits that will be assigned to the same player.\n\n   How to compute the contribution of a digit when we assign it?\n\n   When we assign a digit d at position i to H, then we know that in the final H number, this digit will be preceded by (j) digits already assigned to H (from the left part) and will be followed by (n - j - 1) digits that we haven't assigned yet (which will be the remaining H digits). Therefore, the power of this digit in H is (n - j - 1 - (the number of H digits that are already assigned from the left part))? \n\n   Actually, no: the power is determined by the total number of H digits that are assigned from the entire A. But we don't know the future. However, we can precompute the effect of assigning a digit at a given time to H or M.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a different state: we are going to assign the digits from left to right, and we know that we must assign exactly n to H and n to M.\n\n   We can use state (i, j) where i is the current index (0 to 2n) and j is the number of H digits assigned so far (from 0 to n). Then the number of M digits so far is i - j.\n\n   Then, when we assign the next digit (at index i) to H, then:\n\n        The current digit d_i will be placed in the H number. The total number of H digits we will have at the end is n, so the current digit will be the (j)-th H digit (0-indexed, meaning the next one) and therefore its power is 10^(n - 1 - j) ? \n\n   But wait: the H number has n digits. The first digit (the one we assign first) is the most significant (power 10^(n-1)), the second (assigned next) is 10^(n-2)), etc.\n\n   However, note: we are processing from left to right. The digits assigned to H so far (j digits) have been assigned in increasing index order, so they are the first j digits of H. Then when we assign the next one (the j-th one, counting from 0) then it will be the (j)-th digit (so the power is 10^(n-1-j)).\n\n   Similarly, if we assign a digit to M, then the power for that digit in M is 10^(n-1 - (current count of M digits)).\n\n   But wait: the entire assignment for M is independent. However, we are building two separate numbers. The catch: the two numbers are built independently from disjoint sets, and the digits are fixed in order.\n\n   Then the total prize from the first i digits is:\n\n        dp[i][j] = maximum total prize from the first i digits (having assigned j to H and i-j to M)\n\n   Then, when we assign the next digit (at index i) to H:\n\n        current_digit = A[i]\n        current_digit_value_H = int(A[i]) * (10**(n - 1 - j))\n        Then the rest of the digits (from i+1 to 2n-1) will be assigned arbitrarily, but we know we need to assign n - j - 1 more to H and n - (i - j) more to M? Actually, we don't know the rest.\n\n   But note: we are processing sequentially. We cannot easily separate the contributions because the future digits assigned to H will be less significant than the current one.\n\n   However, if we assign the current digit to H, then the rest of the digits (from i+1 to 2n-1) will be assigned arbitrarily (with the constraint that we must assign n-j-1 more H and n - (i-j) more M). The value of the rest of the digits for H and M is independent? Actually, no: the assignment of the rest of the digits to H or M doesn't affect the current digit's position in the H number (since the current digit is already placed at the j-th position, and the rest of the H digits will be placed in the remaining positions). But the current digit's contribution is fixed: it is int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-j)).\n\n   Similarly, if we assign the current digit to M, then the contribution is int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1 - (i - j))) [because the current count of M is i-j, so the next M digit is the (i-j)-th, and the total M digits is n, so the exponent is (n-1 - (i-j))].\n\n   Then, we can write:\n\n        dp[i][j] = max {\n                (if we assign A[i] to H: \n                    int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-j)) + dp[i+1][j+1]),\n                (if we assign A[i] to M: \n                    int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-(i-j))) + dp[i+1][j])\n            }\n\n   But wait: what is the exponent for M? The current count of M is (i-j) (because we have used i digits, and j are H, so i-j are M). Then the next M digit (this one) will be the (i-j)-th M digit (0-indexed) so it should be multiplied by 10^(n-1 - (i-j))? \n\n   However, note: the M number has n digits. The first M digit (the earliest in A) is the most significant (10^(n-1)), the second (next) is 10^(n-2)), etc.\n\n   But wait: the M digits are assigned in the order of appearance. The first M digit (the earliest) is the most significant. The current digit is the (i-j)-th M digit (meaning there are i-j M digits already assigned, so this one is the (i-j)-th, so it is the (n - (i-j) - 1)-th most significant? Actually, no: the total M digits is n, so the current one (if it is the k-th M digit) will be at position (n - 1 - k) in the M number (if we consider the most significant as the first). But k = i-j (the number of M digits so far). Then the exponent is (n-1 - (i-j)).\n\n   However, note: the M digits that are assigned later (to the right) will be less significant. This is correct.\n\n   But wait: the above recurrence does not account for the fact that the rest of the digits (from i+1 to 2n-1) will be assigned arbitrarily. And we are making a decision for the entire assignment.\n\n   But the state (i, j) must also consider that we have exactly n-j more H to assign and n - (i-j) more M to assign. The total number of digits left is (2n - i). And we require that the remaining H to assign (n-j) must be <= (2n-i) and similarly for M.\n\n   Also, we must ensure that j <= n and i-j <= n.\n\n   The base case: when i == 2n, then we have assigned all digits. Then we check if j == n and i-j == n (which is true) and then dp[2n][n] = 0.\n\n   However, the problem: we are building two numbers, but the recurrence above adds the current digit's contribution and then the future contributions. But the future digits will be assigned arbitrarily, and we assume that the best way to assign the rest is independent. This is true because the digits are independent and the assignment of a digit to H or M only affects its own power (which is determined by the total count of the same player at the time of assignment and the total length). \n\n   But note: the assignment of a digit to H gives a fixed contribution (depending on the current count j) and similarly for M.\n\n   However, the above recurrence does not consider the interaction between the two numbers beyond the current digit. But note: the two numbers are built independently from disjoint sets, and the digits are fixed. The assignment of the rest of the digits only matters for their own contributions, and the contributions are additive and independent.\n\n   Therefore, the recurrence is:\n\n        dp[i][j] = max(\n            (if j < n) then (int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-j)) + dp[i+1][j+1]),\n            (if (i-j) < n) then (int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-(i-j))) + dp[i+1][j])\n        )\n\n   But wait: we must consider both possibilities only if the conditions hold.\n\n   However, there is a problem: the exponent for M depends on the current count of M (which is i-j) and the total M digits is n, so the exponent is (n-1 - (i-j)). But note: the current digit is being assigned as the (i-j)-th M digit, so the exponent is (n-1 - (i-j)).\n\n   But what if we assign the same digit to M, then the next M digit (if any) will have exponent (n-1 - (i-j+1))? Yes, that is correct.\n\n   But note: the state i goes from 0 to 2n, and j from 0 to n. The state space is (2n+1) * (n+1) which is 37*19 ~ 700 states. However, the exponents: 10^(n-1-j) and 10^(n-1-(i-j)) can be very large (n<=18, so exponents up to 10^17). But we are storing the total prize as an integer. The total prize is the sum of two numbers, each of n digits (base 10). The maximum value for one number is 10^n - 1, so the total prize is at most 2*(10^n - 1). For n=18, 10^18 is a very big number (about 1e18), and 2*(10^18) is about 2e18, which is representable in Python integers (Python integers are arbitrary precision, but the exponentiation might be costly). However, we are doing 700 states and each state does two exponentiations (with exponents that are at most 18) so it is acceptable.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the exponentiation 10**k for k up to 18 is fast.\n\n   But wait: the above recurrence does not store the entire assignment, only the maximum total prize. Then how do we reconstruct the sequence?\n\n   We need to not only compute the maximum total prize, but also to output a sequence (string of H and M) that achieves that.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        dp[i][j] = maximum total prize from the first i digits (using j H's) and also store a choice (whether the i-th digit was assigned to H or M) and the next state.\n\n   Alternatively, we can store:\n\n        dp[i][j] = (max_total_prize, choice) \n\n   where choice is None, or 'H', or 'M'\n\n   Then we can backtrack.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Precompute a table dp[i][j] for i in range(0, 2n+1) and j in range(0, n+1).\n\n        Base: dp[2*n][n] = (0, None)\n\n        Then for i from 2n-1 down to 0, and for j from 0 to n:\n\n            Option1: assign A[i] to H, if j < n.\n            Option2: assign A[i] to M, if (i - j) < n.   [Note: the count of M so far is i-j, and we require that we don't exceed n for M, so i-j < n? Actually, we require that the total M digits (i-j + 1) <= n? Actually, the condition for M is that we have not reached n M digits. The current M count is i-j, so we can assign M if i-j < n.\n\n            Then:\n\n                candidate_H = None\n                candidate_M = None\n\n                if j < n:\n                    value_H = int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-j)) + dp[i+1][j+1][0]\n                    candidate_H = ('H', value_H)\n\n                if (i - j) < n:   # because we are going to assign one more M, then the total M becomes i-j+1, so we require i-j+1 <= n -> i-j < n\n                    value_M = int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-(i-j))) + dp[i+1][j][0]\n                    candidate_M = ('M', value_M)\n\n                Then dp[i][j] = the candidate with the highest value.\n\n            But note: the state for the next state for M is dp[i+1][j] (because j doesn't change, but the M count increases implicitly by the state definition: the state (i+1, j) has j H's and (i+1 - j) M's.\n\n        Then we can backtrack from dp[0][0] to build the sequence.\n\n   However, note: the exponent for M: the current count of M is (i-j) (before assigning this digit). Then the exponent is (n-1 - (i-j)).\n\n   But wait: the M number has n digits. The current digit, if assigned to M, will be the (i-j)-th M digit (so the most significant is the 0-th). Then the exponent is (n-1 - (i-j))? \n\n        Example: n=2, i=0, j=0: then if we assign the first digit to M, then the exponent is (2-1 - (0)) = 1. Then the value for that digit is d0 * 10^1.\n\n        Then if we assign the second digit (i=1) to M, then the exponent is (2-1 - (1-0)) = 1 - 1 = 0. Then the value for the second digit is d1 * 1.\n\n        Then the total M number is d0*10 + d1, which is correct.\n\n   Similarly, for H: if we assign the first digit (i=0) to H, then exponent = 2-1-0 = 1 -> d0*10, then the second digit to H: exponent= 2-1-1=0 -> d1*1, so the number is d0*10+d1.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, note: the above recurrence uses the entire future assignment to compute the base case. But wait: the recurrence for dp[i][j] depends on dp[i+1][j+1] and dp[i+1][j]. These states are defined for the entire remaining part. And we are adding the current digit's contribution and then the best from the rest.\n\n   But note: the rest of the digits' contributions are independent and additive. This is because the assignment of the rest of the digits to H or M only affects their own contributions, and the current digit's contribution is fixed.\n\n   Therefore, the recurrence is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if we assign a digit to H, then the rest of the digits (even if assigned to M) do not affect the current digit's position in H? Yes, because the current digit is the j-th H digit (so it is placed at the j-th position, and the remaining H digits (from the rest) are the less significant ones. Similarly for M.\n\n   However, there is a catch: the two numbers are built from disjoint sets, and the digits are fixed. The recurrence does not mix the two numbers beyond the current digit. This is acceptable because the total prize is the sum of the two numbers, and the two numbers are built independently.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        A_str = input().strip()   # string of 2n digits\n\n        Let m = 2*n\n\n        dp = a 2D array of dimensions (m+1) x (n+1) for the maximum total prize.\n        We'll also have a 2D array (or dictionary) for the choice: move_sequence[i][j] = the move we made at digit i (either 'H' or 'M') to achieve dp[i][j], and then we can backtrack.\n\n        Alternatively, we can store the next state: for state (i, j), we store which move we took (and then we know the next state).\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Initialize dp[m][n] = 0, and for other states, we initialize as -infinity (or a very small number) or we do bottom-up from the end.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                dp[i][j] = -10**50   # a very small number\n\n                Then for i from m-1 down to 0, and j from 0 to n:\n\n                    candidate_H = -10**50\n                    candidate_M = -10**50\n\n                    if j < n:\n                        exponent_H = n - 1 - j\n                        value_H = int(A_str[i]) * (10**exponent_H) + dp[i+1][j+1]\n                        candidate_H = value_H\n\n                    if (i - j) < n:   # because we are going to assign M, then the current M count becomes i-j+1, so we require i-j+1 <= n -> i-j < n\n                        exponent_M = n - 1 - (i - j)   # because the current M count (before this assignment) is i-j, so the next M digit is the (i-j)-th, so exponent is (n-1 - (i-j))\n                        value_M = int(A_str[i]) * (10**exponent_M) + dp[i+1][j]\n                        candidate_M = value_M\n\n                    Then dp[i][j] = max(candidate_H, candidate_M)   [if both are available, else only one]\n\n                    But we must record the move we did.\n\n            However, we must be cautious: the state dp[i][j] is defined for having processed i digits (from 0 to i-1) and having j H's. Then the current digit is the i-th digit (index i, 0-indexed).\n\n            But wait, our indexing: \n                i: from 0 to m-1 (for the digits) and then we consider dp[i][j] for the first i digits. Then the next state is i+1.\n\n            Alternatively, we can index by the digit index i (from 0 to m) and j (from 0 to n). Then dp[i][j] is for the first i digits (so we have processed i digits, and we are about to process the i-th digit? Actually, no: we want to assign the i-th digit (the one at index i) from the string.\n\n            Let's reframe: we are processing from left to right. We have a string A of length 2n. We consider the first i digits (i from 0 to 2n). Then the next digit is the i-th digit (if we are at state i, then we have processed",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total prize for two players, Homer and Marge, in a game where they alternately take digits from a given number A. The total prize is the sum of the numbers formed by each player from the digits they collect. The challenge is to determine the optimal sequence of moves (a string of 'H' and 'M') such that both players make exactly n moves, and the sum of their numbers is maximized.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves splitting the digits of a 2n-digit number into two subsequences of n digits each, one for each player, while preserving the original order of digits. The goal is to maximize the sum of the two numbers formed by these subsequences.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP table `dp[i][j]` where `i` is the number of digits processed so far, and `j` is the number of digits assigned to Homer. The value `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum total prize achievable from the first `i` digits with `j` digits assigned to Homer.\n3. **State Transition**: For each digit, we consider assigning it to either Homer or Marge. If assigned to Homer, the digit's contribution is calculated based on its position in Homer's number (most significant digit if assigned early). Similarly for Marge. The DP state transitions involve updating the count of digits assigned to each player and the total prize.\n4. **Backtracking**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from `dp[0][0]` to construct the optimal move sequence by checking which choice (Homer or Marge) led to the maximum prize at each step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    m = 2 * n\n    A_str = data[1].strip()\n    \n    dp = [[-1] * (n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]\n    move_choice = [[''] * (n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]\n    \n    dp[m][n] = 0\n    \n    for i in range(m-1, -1, -1):\n        for j in range(n+1):\n            candidate_H = -1\n            candidate_M = -1\n            \n            if j < n:\n                exponent_H = n - 1 - j\n                value_H = int(A_str[i]) * (10 ** exponent_H) + dp[i+1][j+1]\n                candidate_H = value_H\n                \n            if (i - j) < n:\n                exponent_M = n - 1 - (i - j)\n                value_M = int(A_str[i]) * (10 ** exponent_M) + dp[i+1][j]\n                candidate_M = value_M\n                \n            if candidate_H == -1 and candidate_M == -1:\n                dp[i][j] = -1\n            elif candidate_H == -1:\n                dp[i][j] = candidate_M\n                move_choice[i][j] = 'M'\n            elif candidate_M == -1:\n                dp[i][j] = candidate_H\n                move_choice[i][j] = 'H'\n            else:\n                if candidate_H > candidate_M:\n                    dp[i][j] = candidate_H\n                    move_choice[i][j] = 'H'\n                else:\n                    dp[i][j] = candidate_M\n                    move_choice[i][j] = 'M'\n                    \n    seq = []\n    i, j = 0, 0\n    while i < m:\n        move_char = move_choice[i][j]\n        seq.append(move_char)\n        if move_char == 'H':\n            i += 1\n            j += 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n            \n    result_seq = ''.join(seq)\n    print(result_seq)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The input consists of an integer `n` and a string `A` of 2n digits. The DP table `dp` is initialized to store the maximum prize for each state `(i, j)`, and `move_choice` records the optimal move at each state.\n2. **Base Case**: The base case `dp[m][n] = 0` signifies that after processing all digits (`m = 2n`) with `n` digits assigned to each player, the total prize is zero.\n3. **DP Table Filling**: The table is filled in reverse order (from the end to the start). For each digit, we calculate the potential contribution to the total prize if it is assigned to either player, considering their current counts and the digit's position.\n4. **Backtracking**: Starting from `dp[0][0]`, we follow the recorded moves to construct the sequence. Each move ('H' or 'M') is appended to the result sequence based on the optimal choice stored in `move_choice`.\n5. **Output**: The constructed sequence of moves is printed, ensuring both players make exactly `n` moves and the total prize is maximized.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible move sequences using dynamic programming and backtracking to find the optimal solution without explicitly enumerating all possibilities, leveraging the problem's structure for performance.",
