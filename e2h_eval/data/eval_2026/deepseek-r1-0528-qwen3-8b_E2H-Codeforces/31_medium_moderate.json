Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards)\n We can use any number of additional cards, each with an integer between -x and x (inclusive), to make the total sum zero.\n We want the minimum number of additional cards.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Let S be the sum of the found cards.\n 2. We are allowed to add any number of cards, each card's value in [-x, x]. We wish to minimize the count.\n\n However, note: we can also use negative cards. The problem is similar to: \n   We have a target deficit of -S (if S is positive) or surplus (if S is negative). Actually, we need to achieve a total sum of 0.\n\n But note: if we let k be the number of additional cards, then we must have that the sum of the k cards is -S.\n\n Conditions:\n   Each card is in [-x, x], so the maximum absolute value of one card is x.\n\n Observation:\n   We are to cover the deficit/surplus (which is -S) with k cards, each contributing at most x in absolute value.\n\n   Therefore, the total absolute contribution we can get from k cards is at most k*x (but note: we can have positive and negative).\n\n   However, we are free to choose the signs. We require that there exists a set of k integers (each in [-x, x]) such that their sum is -S.\n\n   Constraints on k:\n     - If S == 0, then we don't need any card -> answer 0.\n     - Otherwise, we need at least ceil(|S| / x) because one card can contribute at most x (in absolute value) to reduce the deficit.\n\n   But wait: consider if S is negative. Then we need to add positive cards? Actually, no: we need to make the total sum 0.\n        Currently, the sum is S. We want to add k cards with total sum T such that S + T = 0 => T = -S.\n\n   So if S is negative, then T is positive. Similarly, if S is positive, then T is negative.\n\n   However, note: we can use both positive and negative cards arbitrarily (as long as |card|<=x). So the condition is:\n\n        There exists an integer k and a set of k numbers (each in [-x,x]) such that their sum is -S.\n\n   What is the minimal k?\n\n   Note: The minimal k must be at least ceil(|S| / x). Why?\n        Because the maximum absolute value of the sum we can achieve with k cards is k*x (if all are same sign). \n        But note: we don't require all to be the same sign. However, to cancel S, we need to have a total absolute value of at least |S|.\n\n        Actually, the total absolute value we can achieve with k cards is at most k*x. But we are not limited by absolute value in the sense of direction? \n\n        However, we require the sum to be exactly -S. The necessary condition is that |T| = |S| must be <= k*x.\n\n        Moreover, we can form any integer T in the range [-k*x, k*x] with k cards? Not exactly: for example, with k=1, we can only get integers from -x to x. With k=2, we can get from -2x to 2x, but note: we can get every integer in between? Not necessarily: for example, with k=2 and x=1, we can get even numbers? Actually, with two ones we can get 2,0,-2? Actually, we can get 2, 0, -2, and also 1+(-1)=0, 1+1=2, -1+1=0, -1-1=-2. So we can get every even number between -2 and 2? Actually, we can get every integer between -2 and 2? No: we cannot get 1 with two cards of absolute value 1? Wait, no: we can have 1 and 0? But wait, the cards are from -x to x. In this case x=1, so we have {-1,0,1}. Then we can get 1+0=1, 1+(-1)=0, etc. Actually, the set of numbers we can form with k cards from [-x,x] is every integer between -k*x and k*x that has the same parity as k*x? Not exactly.\n\n   Let me reframe: we are allowed to choose any integers from -x to x. Then the problem becomes: what is the minimum k such that there exists an integer T (with |T|<=k*x) and T ≡ -S (mod 1)? Actually, we can form any integer T in the range [-k*x, k*x] as long as T has the same parity as k*x (if we consider that each card can be chosen arbitrarily, then the set of achievable T is the entire interval [-k*x, k*x] because we can adjust by 1? \n\n   Actually, we can form any integer between -k*x and k*x. Why?\n        We can use the following: with k cards, we can set one card to any value, and the rest can be set to 0 (if 0 is available) but wait: the set of available numbers is from -x to x. However, if we have at least one card, we can get every integer in [-x, x]. Then with two cards, we can get from -2x to 2x, but we might skip some numbers? \n\n   Example: x=1, k=2: we can get from -2 to 2. How?\n        -2: (-1, -1)\n        -1: (-1, 0) or (0, -1) but wait: we have 0 available? Actually, the problem says the initial set has every integer from -x to x. So 0 is included.\n\n   But wait: the problem does not say that the available cards are from -x to x without repetition. It says \"infinitely many cards with each integer number from -x to x\". So we can use zeros.\n\n   Then, with zeros, we can form any integer T in the range [-k*x, k*x] because we can use one card to set the value and the rest to 0. However, note: we cannot exceed the absolute value of x per card. But if we set one card to a value v (with |v|<=x) and the others to 0, then the total is v, which is in [-x, x]. But then how do we get, say, 2*x? We set two cards to x and the rest to 0. Similarly, we can get any integer T with |T| <= k*x by using at most min(k, |T|//x) non-zero cards and setting the rest to 0, but wait: we can also use negative and positive.\n\n   Actually, since we can use zeros, the set of achievable T is indeed the set of integers from -k*x to k*x. Why?\n        To achieve T, we can use floor(|T|/x) non-zero cards and then one more card to adjust the remainder (if any). But note: we can use multiple cards to build up T. However, zeros don't help in building T, but they don't hurt. Actually, the key is that we can break T into parts: we can use as many zeros as we like, so effectively we are only concerned with the non-zero cards. But the non-zero cards can contribute any integer from -x to x. \n\n        However, we can use the following: \n          Let k_min = ceil(|T| / x) for the absolute value part, but actually we can use a mix of positive and negative.\n\n   Actually, the problem is simpler: we wish to represent -S as the sum of k integers, each between -x and x.\n\n   Conditions for existence:\n        Condition 1: | -S | <= k*x   (i.e., |S| <= k*x)\n        Condition 2: Additionally, we must be able to form -S with k cards. Since we have zeros and can use any integers, the only condition is that the absolute value of -S is at most k*x. However, note: we can also use negative and positive arbitrarily. \n\n        But wait: what if S is very large? For example, if S=1000, x=1, then we need at least 1000 cards. And indeed, 1000*1 >= 1000.\n\n        However, there is no parity condition because we can use zeros and then use positive and negative arbitrarily. Actually, the set of achievable sums with k cards (each from -x to x) is the set of all integers from -k*x to k*x.\n\n        Why? Consider: \n          We start with 0. Then we can add k numbers, each in [-x, x]. This is equivalent to: \n            T = a1 + a2 + ... + ak, where each ai in [-x, x].\n\n          The minimum T is -k*x, the maximum is k*x. And because we can change one card by 1 (by replacing a card with value v by v+1, provided that v+1 is still <=x, or similarly for negative) we can traverse every integer in between.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is simply: k*x >= |S|.\n\n        Then the minimal k is ceil(|S| / x). But wait: consider the example:\n\n        Example 1: Input \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n            n=3, x=2, cards = [-1,1,2] -> S = -1+1+2 = 2.\n            Then we need to add a card with value -2 (so k=1). Indeed, 1*2 >= 2 -> k>=1, so minimal k=1.\n\n        Example 2: Input \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n            n=2, x=3, cards = [-2,-2] -> S = -4.\n            Then we need to add two cards: each card can be at most 3, so two cards can give at most 6. But we need a total of 4. \n            However, the minimal k must satisfy k*3 >= 4 -> k>= ceil(4/3)=2. So k=2.\n\n            Now, can we form 4 with two cards (each in [-3,3])? Yes: 3+1=4, but wait: we have two cards. Actually, we can use two cards: 3 and 1, but 1 is allowed. However, note: we have two cards and we can use any numbers. Alternatively, we can use two cards: 2 and 2 (which is 4). But wait: 2 is allowed because |2|<=3.\n\n            However, wait: the example output is 2.\n\n        But what if S=0? Then we need 0 cards.\n\n        However, consider: what if S is not divisible by x? For example, S=5, x=2. Then ceil(5/2)=ceil(2.5)=3. \n            With k=3, the maximum absolute sum is 6, and we need 5. We can form 5: for example, 2+2+1=5. But wait, we can also use negative? Actually, we need to form 5 (if S=-5, then we need to form 5). But if S=5, then we need to form -5. \n\n        Actually, the condition is symmetric. The requirement is that the absolute value of the deficit (|S|) must be <= k*x. And the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |S|.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is: k = ceil(|S| / x)\n\n        BUT WAIT: let's test with the examples.\n\n        Example 1: |S|=2, x=2 -> ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1 -> correct.\n        Example 2: |S|=4, x=3 -> ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2 -> correct.\n\n        However, consider another example: \n            Input: \"1 1\\n0\" -> n=1, x=1, card=[0] -> S=0, so k=0 -> correct.\n\n        Another example: \n            Input: \"1 1\\n1\" -> S=1, then k = ceil(1/1)=1. Then we add one card with -1. Correct.\n\n        But wait: what if S=0? Then we don't need to add any card.\n\n        However, what if we have multiple cards and the sum is zero? Then we don't need to add any card.\n\n        However, consider: \n            Input: \"1 1\\n1\" -> n=1, x=1, card=[1] -> S=1, so we need 1 card.\n\n        But what if S is negative? \n            Input: \"1 1\\n-1\" -> S=-1, then we need to form 1. So k=ceil(1/1)=1.\n\n        However, wait: the problem says that we can use cards with numbers from -x to x. So for x=1, we can use -1,0,1.\n\n        But there is a catch: the above reasoning assumed that we can form any integer T in the interval [-k*x, k*x]. This is true because we can use zeros and adjust the other cards arbitrarily. However, note that the cards we use must be integers. Since the set of integers is complete, and the range is contiguous, yes.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is simply: \n            Let S = sum(found_cards)\n            If S == 0: print(0)\n            Else: print(ceil(|S| / x))\n\n        However, wait: what if |S| is 0? Then we print 0.\n\n        But note: what if the problem allows us to use negative cards to cancel a positive sum? Yes, but the minimal k is determined by the absolute value.\n\n        However, let me check the sample: \n            Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> S=-4, then |S|=4, x=3 -> ceil(4/3)=2.\n\n        But what about if we have a deficit that is not a multiple of x? For example, S=3, x=2: \n            Then we need k such that 2*k >= 3 -> k>=2 (since 1*2=2 < 3, so k=2). Then with two cards, maximum absolute value is 4, and we need to form 3. We can do 2+1=3, and 2 and 1 are allowed (both <=2). So it works.\n\n        However, wait: what if S=3 and x=2, then the minimal k is 2.\n\n        But note: we cannot use fractional cards. So the formula holds.\n\n        However, wait: there is an alternative way. We might be able to use fewer cards if we use negative numbers? \n\n        Actually, the deficit must be canceled. We need to form T = -S. The minimal k is the smallest integer k such that there exists a representation of T as the sum of k integers, each in [-x, x]. \n\n        The necessary and sufficient condition is that k*x >= |T| (because the maximum absolute value we can get is k*x). \n\n        So the minimal k is ceil(|T| / x) = ceil(|S| / x).\n\n        But note: sometimes we might be able to use negative and positive together to form a deficit that is not a multiple of x? \n\n        Example: S=5, x=2. Then |S|=5, so k_min = ceil(5/2)=3. But can we form 5 with 3 cards? \n            Maximum per card is 2, so 3*2=6 >=5. \n            We can do: 2+2+1=5 -> yes.\n\n        But wait: what if S=4, x=3? Then ceil(4/3)=2. And 2*3=6>=4, and we can form 4 (for example, 3+1=4). \n\n        Therefore, the answer is: k = ceil(|S| / x)\n\n        However, wait: what if S=0? Then we don't need to add any card. So k=0.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"minimum number of cards does he need to find\".\n\n        However, wait: consider the possibility that we might already have a sum of zero. Then we don't need to add any card.\n\n        So algorithm:\n\n            n, x = map(int, input().split())\n            cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            total = sum(cards)\n            if total == 0:\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                # We need to compute ceil(|total| / x)\n                abs_total = abs(total)\n                # k = ceil(abs_total / x) = (abs_total + x - 1) // x   [if we do integer ceiling division for positive numbers]\n\n                # But note: if abs_total is 0, then we already handled. So abs_total>0.\n\n                # Example: abs_total=2, x=2 -> (2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 (if integer division) -> but we want 1, correct.\n                # Example: abs_total=4, x=3 -> (4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3 = 2, correct.\n\n                # However, if we do: \n                #   k = (abs_total + x - 1) // x   [this is ceiling division for positive numbers]\n\n                # But note: if abs_total is divisible by x, then (abs_total+x-1)//x = (abs_total-1)//x + 1, which is the same as abs_total//x.\n\n                # Actually, the standard way for ceiling division of a/b (for positive a,b) is: (a + b - 1) // b\n\n                k = (abs_total + x - 1) // x\n                # But wait: what if abs_total is 0? Then we get (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x. For x>=1, (x-1)//x is 0 when x>1, but if x=1 then (0+1-1)//1 = 0//1=0. So it works.\n\n                # However, we already handled total==0, so we can use this.\n\n                print(k)\n\n        But wait: is that always true? Consider: we are allowed to use any integer from -x to x. So the condition is that the absolute value of the deficit must be at most k*x. \n\n        However, note: we are forming the deficit (which is -total) with k cards. The deficit is an integer, and the condition is that the absolute value of the deficit is <= k*x.\n\n        But note: the minimal k must satisfy k*x >= |total|. \n\n        However, there is no requirement that the deficit must be exactly representable by k cards? Actually, we just proved that we can represent any integer T with |T|<=k*x. \n\n        Therefore, the above solution is correct.\n\n        But wait: the example provided in the note: \n            Input: ['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2'] -> outputs ['1','2'].\n\n        However, let me test with the provided examples:\n\n            Example 1: n=3, x=2, cards = [-1,1,2] -> total = 2, then k = ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1 -> prints 1. Correct.\n\n            Example 2: n=2, x=3, cards = [-2,-2] -> total = -4, abs_total=4, then k = ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2 -> prints 2. Correct.\n\n        However, wait: consider a different example. Suppose we have:\n\n            Input: \"1 10\\n1\" -> total=1, then k=ceil(1/10)=1. Correct.\n\n            Input: \"1 10\\n10\" -> total=10, then k=ceil(10/10)=1. Correct.\n\n            Input: \"2 10\\n10 10\" -> total=20, k=ceil(20/10)=2. Correct.\n\n        But wait, what if the deficit is 1 and x=10? Then we can use one card with -1, which is allowed. So one card is enough.\n\n        However, wait: the deficit is 1, so we need to form 1 (if S=-1) or -1 (if S=1). Actually, if S=1, then we need to form -1. We can form -1 with one card. Similarly, if S=-1, we form 1 with one card.\n\n        But wait: the example \"1 10\\n1\" gives S=1, so we need to form -1. The minimal k is 1.\n\n        But wait: what if the deficit is 1 and x=10, then one card is enough. Our formula uses the absolute value: |S|=1, so k=ceil(1/10)=1.\n\n        However, note: the deficit is 1, and we can form 1 (if S=-1) or -1 (if S=1). But the condition is that the absolute value of the deficit is 1, so k=ceil(1/10)=1.\n\n        So the formula is independent of the sign.\n\n        But wait: there is a catch. What if the deficit is 0? Then we don't need any card. But our formula handles that separately.\n\n        However, wait: what if we have a deficit that is not an integer? But the deficit is an integer because the found cards are integers.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            n, x = map(int, input().split())\n            cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            total = sum(cards)\n            if total == 0:\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                abs_total = abs(total)\n                k = (abs_total + x - 1) // x\n                # But wait: is this ceiling division correct for positive numbers? \n                # Example: abs_total=5, x=2 -> (5+2-1)//2 = 6//2=3 -> correct.\n                # Example: abs_total=4, x=2 -> (4+2-1)//2 = 5//2=2 -> correct.\n\n                print(k)\n\n        However, wait: let me test with an example that requires more than one card but the deficit is not an exact multiple.\n\n        Example: S=3, x=2 -> abs_total=3, then k=(3+2-1)//2 = (4)//2=2. Correct.\n\n        But wait: what if S=0? Then we print 0. That's correct.\n\n        However, wait: the problem statement says that the found cards are n cards. And the initial set has infinitely many cards from -x to x. So we can use as many as we want.\n\n        But wait: the above reasoning is correct? \n\n        However, wait: consider the following scenario:\n\n            We have found cards with total S, and we wish to add k cards (each from -x to x) such that the new total is 0.\n\n            The equation is: S + (sum of k cards) = 0  => sum of k cards = -S.\n\n            The minimal k is the smallest integer such that there exists an integer solution for the k cards (each between -x and x) that sums to -S.\n\n            The necessary and sufficient condition is that the absolute value of -S is <= k*x, i.e., |S| <= k*x.\n\n            Then the minimal k is ceil(|S|/x).\n\n        Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n        But wait: what if S is negative? Then |S| is positive, and the condition is the same.\n\n        However, wait: there is a known issue: the ceiling division for positive numbers is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if the deficit is 0? Then we don't need any card. The above code handles that.\n\n        However, wait: what if the deficit is 0, then we print 0. But what if the deficit is 0 and we are forced to use at least one card? No, the problem doesn't force. The goal is to have the sum zero. If the found cards already sum to zero, then we don't need to add any.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        BUT WAIT: There is a known flaw. \n\n        Consider: what if the deficit is 0, but we have an even number of cards and the problem says we can use zeros? Actually, zeros are allowed. So if the found cards already sum to zero, we don't need to add any.\n\n        However, consider the possibility that we might use negative and positive cards to adjust the sum even if the current sum is non-zero? But the above formula is based solely on the absolute value.\n\n        But wait: the above reasoning does not account for the fact that we might use negative and positive cards to cancel out the deficit. However, note that the condition is that the absolute value of the deficit must be <= k*x. This condition is necessary and sufficient.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            n, x = map(int, input().split())\n            arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            s = sum(arr)\n            if s == 0:\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                # Calculate the absolute value of s\n                abs_s = abs(s)\n                # Ceiling division: (abs_s + x - 1) // x\n                k = (abs_s + x - 1) // x\n                print(k)\n\n        However, wait: what if the deficit is 0? Then we print 0. But what if the deficit is 0, but the problem says we can use zeros? Actually, we don't need to use any card.\n\n        But wait: there is a twist. The problem says: \"You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x.\"\n\n        We are allowed to use zeros. But note: if the deficit is 0, we don't need to add any card.\n\n        However, wait: what if the deficit is not 0, but we can use a combination of positive and negative cards that might not require the total absolute value being covered by one type? \n\n        But the condition we used (|S| <= k*x) is necessary and sufficient because the set of achievable sums with k cards is the entire interval [-k*x, k*x]. \n\n        Therefore, the above solution is correct.\n\n        However, wait: I just saw an example that breaks the ceiling division method? \n\n        Example: x=2, S=3. Then k = ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2. But with two cards, the maximum absolute value we can get is 4 (2+2) and we need 3. We can do 2+1=3, and 1 is allowed (<=2). So it's okay.\n\n        But wait: what if x=2, S=5? Then k=ceil(5/2)=ceil(2.5)=3. With three cards, the maximum absolute value is 6, and we can form 5 (for example, 2+2+1). \n\n        But wait: what if x=2, S=1? Then k=ceil(1/2)=ceil(0.5)=1. One card: we can use 1 (if we need to form -1) or -1 (if we need to form 1). But wait: if S=1, then we need to form -1. We can use one card with -1. Correct.\n\n        However, wait: what if x=2, S=2? Then k=ceil(2/2)=1. Correct.\n\n        But wait: what if x=2, S=4? Then k=ceil(4/2)=2. Correct.\n\n        But wait: what if x=2, S=6? Then k=ceil(6/2)=3. Correct.\n\n        However, wait: what if x=2, S=7? Then k=ceil(7/2)=ceil(3.5)=4. With four cards, maximum absolute value is 8, and we can form 7? \n            We need to form 7 (if S=-7) or -7 (if S=7). Let's take S=7 (so we need to form -7). \n            We can use four cards: -2, -2, -2, -1 -> -2-2-2-1 = -7. Correct.\n\n        Therefore, the solution is:\n\n            Read n and x, then the list of n integers.\n            Compute the total sum of the found cards.\n            If total is 0, output 0.\n            Else, output ceil(|total| / x) = (abs(total) + x - 1) // x.\n\n        However, wait: there's a catch. The problem says the cards found have numbers that do not exceed x in absolute value. But the deficit we are forming (the additional cards) can be any integer from -x to x.\n\n        But wait: what if the deficit is 1 and x=1? Then k=ceil(1/1)=1 -> correct.\n\n        But wait: what if the deficit is 0? Then we output 0. But what if the deficit is 0 and we are forced to use at least one card? No, the problem says minimum number of cards. Zero is the minimum.\n\n        However, wait: the problem states that we can use any number of cards. So 0 is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            n, x = map(int, input().split())\n            arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            s = sum(arr)\n            if s == 0:\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                abs_s = abs(s)\n                # Ceiling division for positive integers: (abs_s + x - 1) // x\n                k = (abs_s + x - 1) // x\n                print(k)\n\n        But wait: wait a minute! There is a known issue with the ceiling division formula for integers. The formula (a + b - 1) // b is standard for positive integers. But note: if abs_s is 0, we already handled. So we are safe.\n\n        However, wait: let me test with the sample inputs from the problem:\n\n            Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> s=2, abs_s=2, k=(2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 (in integer division) -> correct.\n\n            Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> s=-4, abs_s=4, k=(4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3=2 -> correct.\n\n        But wait, what if the deficit is 0? Then we don't enter the else branch.\n\n        However, wait: what if the deficit is 0, but the found cards are non-zero? Actually, no: the deficit is the total of the found cards. If the total is 0, then we don't need to add any.\n\n        But wait: the problem says \"the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero\", so if the found cards sum to zero, then we are done.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        However, wait: there is a known issue in competitive programming problems: sometimes the input might be tricky. The problem says the first line contains two integers: n and x. The second line contains n space-separated integers.\n\n        We are reading correctly.\n\n        But wait: what if n=0? The problem states n>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n        Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n        However, wait: after reading the problem again, note that the found cards are n cards, and the initial set has infinitely many cards from -x to x. But the found cards are given and we are allowed to use any cards (from the infinite set) as many times as we want.\n\n        The above solution is correct.\n\n        But wait: let me check the example from the note again: \n            Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> n=2, x=3, cards=[-2,-2] -> total=-4, then k=ceil(4/3)=2.\n\n        But why can't we use one card? Because one card can only provide a maximum absolute value of 3, and 3<4. So we cannot form 4 with one card (since the maximum is 3). Therefore, we need at least two cards.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        However, wait: what if we have a deficit of 3 and x=2? Then k=ceil(3/2)=2. But two cards can form 3: 2+1=3. But wait: the available cards are from -2 to 2. We have 1 and 2, which are allowed. So two cards are needed.\n\n        But wait: what if the deficit is 3 and x=2, then one card cannot form 3 (because maximum card is 2). So two cards are needed. Correct.\n\n        One more: deficit=5, x=2 -> k=ceil(5/2)=3. Three cards: 2+2+1=5. Correct.\n\n        But wait: what if deficit=5 and x=3? Then k=ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2. Two cards: maximum absolute value is 6, and we can form 5: 3+2=5 (and 2 is allowed because |2|<=3). So two cards. Correct.\n\n        Therefore, the formula holds.\n\n        However, wait: what if deficit=5 and x=2, but we use negative cards? Actually, we are forming the deficit (which is 5 or -5). If we have a deficit of 5 (meaning we need to add 5 to the total to make it zero? Actually, no: the current total is S, and we want to add cards to make the total 0. So if S=5, we need to add cards that sum to -5. Similarly, if S=-5, we need to add cards that sum to 5.\n\n        The formula uses the absolute value. So |S| is the amount we need to cancel.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            n, x = map(int, input().split())\n            arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            s = sum(arr)\n            if s == 0:\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                abs_s = abs(s)\n                k = (abs_s + x - 1) // x\n                print(k)\n\n        But wait: wait a minute, I just realized: the ceiling division formula (a + b - 1) // b is for positive integers. What if abs_s is 0? Then we avoid it by the if. So it's safe.\n\n        However, wait: what if x is 0? The problem states x>=1, so no.\n\n        Therefore, we are done.\n\n        Let me run the provided examples:\n\n            Example 1: \n                Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n                n=3, x=2, arr=[-1,1,2] -> s=2, then k=(2+2-1)//2 = 3//2 = 1 (in Python, integer division truncates toward 0 for positive numbers) -> 1. Correct.\n\n            Example 2:\n                Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n                n=2, x=3, arr=[-2,-2] -> s=-4, abs_s=4, k=(4+3-1)//3 = 6//3=2. Correct.\n\n        But wait: wait, wait, wait! There is a known flaw in the logic.\n\n        The flaw is: the condition we used is that the absolute value of the deficit must be <= k*x. This is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a representation. \n\n        However, note: the deficit is -S, and the cards we use can be positive or negative. The condition is that the absolute value of the deficit is at most k*x. \n\n        But note: the deficit is -S, so the absolute value is |S|. \n\n        However, wait: what if S is negative? Then |S| is positive. \n\n        But wait: the condition is that the absolute value of the deficit (which is |S|) must be <= k*x. \n\n        However, there is an alternative representation: sometimes we might use a combination of positive and negative cards to cancel out the deficit, and that might allow us to use fewer cards? \n\n        Actually, no: the condition is necessary and sufficient. The minimal k is the smallest integer such that k*x >= |S|.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        But wait: I recall that in some problems, the minimal number of coins (or cards) required to form a total might have a different condition when the coins are not unbounded in sign? But here, the cards can be positive and negative arbitrarily (within the absolute limit). \n\n        Therefore, I believe the solution is correct.\n\n        However, wait: there is a known issue in the problem \"Vanya and Cards\" from Codeforces? \n\n        Actually, I remember a similar problem: sometimes the minimal representation might require that we cannot use the same card twice? But wait, the problem says",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all the numbers on the found cards equals zero. Each additional card must have an integer value between -x and x (inclusive), where x is given as part of the input.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the sum of the found cards must be canceled out by the sum of the additional cards. The deficit (or surplus) from the found cards is calculated as the absolute value of their sum. The minimal number of additional cards required is determined by how much this deficit can be covered by each card's maximum absolute value (x). Specifically, the minimal number of cards needed is the ceiling of the deficit divided by x, i.e., `ceil(|total| / x)`.\n\n2. **Intuition**: If the sum of the found cards is already zero, no additional cards are needed. Otherwise, the minimal number of cards required is the smallest integer k such that k * x is at least the absolute value of the total sum of the found cards. This is because each card can contribute at most x (in absolute value) towards canceling the deficit.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Calculating the total sum of the found cards.\n   - If the total sum is zero, output 0.\n   - Otherwise, compute the ceiling of the absolute value of the total sum divided by x using integer arithmetic: `(abs(total) + x - 1) // x`.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves a single pass through the list of found cards to compute their sum, which is O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of cards. The space complexity is O(1) as we only store the sum and other variables.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total = sum(arr)\n    if total == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        abs_total = abs(total)\n        k = (abs_total + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first two values are n (number of found cards) and x (maximum absolute value of any card). The subsequent values are the numbers on the found cards.\n- **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. If this sum is zero, the answer is immediately 0 since no additional cards are needed.\n- **Ceiling Division**: For a non-zero sum, the absolute value of the sum is taken. The minimal number of cards required is calculated using ceiling division, which is efficiently computed as `(abs_total + x - 1) // x`. This formula ensures that any fractional part of the division result is rounded up to the next integer, giving the correct minimal number of cards.\n- **Output**: The result is printed, which is either 0 or the computed minimal number of cards.\n\nThis approach efficiently addresses the problem by leveraging simple arithmetic operations and ensures optimal performance with minimal computational overhead.",
