Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting non-degenerate triangles (x, y, z) with integer sides such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\nBut note: the condition is actually: \n   A <= x <= B and B <= y <= C and C <= z <= D.\n\nHowever, the triangle inequality must hold: for any three sides (a, b, c) we require:\n   a + b > c, a + c > b, b + c > a.\n\nBut note that in our case, we have fixed ordering: x <= y <= z (since x from [A,B] and y from [B,C] and z from [C,D] and because A<=B<=C<=D, so x<=y<=z). \n\nIn a triangle with sides x <= y <= z, the necessary and sufficient condition for non-degeneracy is:\n   x + y > z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of triples (x,y,z) with:\n   x in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D] and x+y>z.\n\nWe cannot iterate over all possibilities because A, B, C, D can be up to 500000.\n\nWe need to use mathematical counting and inclusion-exclusion.\n\nLet me denote:\n   L1 = [A, B] for x\n   L2 = [B, C] for y\n   L3 = [C, D] for z\n\nWe want to count:\n   Sum_{x=A}^{B} Sum_{y=B}^{C} Sum_{z=C}^{D} [x+y>z]\n\nWe can fix z first, then for each z, count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y > z, with x in [A,B] and y in [B, min(C, z-1)]? Actually, note: we require x+y>z, and note that since x<=y<=z, we have x+y>=x+x and also note that the condition is symmetric in x and y but the ranges are independent.\n\nAlternatively, we can fix x and y and then count the z such that z < x+y and z>=C and z<=D. But then we have to consider that y is at least B and at most C, and x is at least A and at most B.\n\nBut note: the condition is x+y>z, so z < x+y. And z is in [C, D]. So for fixed (x,y), the valid z are from C to min(D, x+y-1). But then we have to sum over all x and y.\n\nBut the total number of x and y is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) which can be about 2.5e11 (if A=1, B=500000, then B-A+1 ~500000, and if C-B+1 is 500000, then product is 25e10) which is too many to iterate.\n\nWe need another approach.\n\nLet's try to fix z first. Then we require x+y > z, and we have constraints on x and y.\n\nBut note: the condition is x+y>z, and we know that x in [A, B] and y in [B, C]. However, note that y must be at least B, but also note that for a fixed z, we require y >= max(B, z - x + 1)? Actually, we can think:\n\nFor fixed z, we require x+y>z. Since x<=y, we have x+y <= 2*y, but more importantly, we can express y > z - x.\n\nBut x is from A to B, and y is from max(B, z-x+1) to C (but note: we also have the constraint that y>=B and y<=C).\n\nSo for fixed z, the condition becomes: for each x in [A, B] such that there exists y in [max(B, z-x+1), C] (and note that we must have max(B, z-x+1) <= C for there to be any y).\n\nBut then the count for fixed z would be: for each x from max(A, ?) to min(B, ?) we can count the number of y in the interval [L, C] where L = max(B, z-x+1). Then we can write:\n\n   Let x_min = max(A, z - y_max) ??? Not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, we can change the order: we can fix x and then count the y's that satisfy y > z-x and y>=B and y<=C. Then for fixed x and z, the condition on y is: y >= max(B, floor(z-x)+1) and",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\) holds. The key insight here is recognizing that for three sides \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\) to form a non-degenerate triangle, they must satisfy the triangle inequality \\(x + y > z\\). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires counting all possible triples \\((x, y, z)\\) within specified ranges where the triangle inequality holds. Given the constraints, a brute-force approach is infeasible due to the large possible range of values (up to \\(5 \\times 10^5\\)).\n2. **Key Insight**: For each possible side \\(z\\) (from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\)), we determine the range of pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x + y > z\\). Here, \\(x\\) ranges from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) and \\(y\\) ranges from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\).\n3. **Mathematical Formulation**: For each \\(z\\), the valid \\(x\\) values start from \\(A\\) but must be at least \\(z - C\\) (since \\(y \\leq C\\)). Similarly, \\(y\\) must be at least \\(max(B, z - x + 1)\\). The solution involves iterating over all possible \\(z\\) values and for each \\(z\\), calculating the number of valid \\((x, y)\\) pairs using mathematical ranges and inclusion-exclusion principles.\n4. **Efficiency**: The approach efficiently counts valid triples by leveraging mathematical ranges and avoiding nested loops, thus reducing the time complexity from \\(O(N^3)\\) to \\(O(N)\\), which is feasible for large inputs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    A = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    C = int(data[2])\n    D = int(data[3])\n    \n    total = 0\n    for z in range(C, D + 1):\n        low_x = max(A, z - C + 1)\n        if low_x > B:\n            continue\n            \n        high_x = min(B, z - B)\n        if high_x < A:\n            continue\n            \n        low_x_val = max(A, z - C + 1)\n        high_x_val = B\n        \n        if low_x_val <= high_x_val:\n            n_x = high_x_val - low_x_val + 1\n        else:\n            n_x = 0\n            \n        low_y_val = B\n        high_y_val = min(C, z - low_x_val)\n        \n        if low_y_val <= high_y_val:\n            n_y = high_y_val - low_y_val + 1\n        else:\n            n_y = 0\n            \n        total += n_x * n_y\n        \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of four integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) which define the ranges for \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\).\n2. **Iterating Over \\(z\\)**: For each \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), the code determines the valid range of \\(x\\) values such that \\(x + y > z\\) for some \\(y\\) in \\([B, C]\\).\n3. **Calculating Valid \\(x\\) Values**: The lower bound for \\(x\\) is set to the maximum of \\(A\\) and \\(z - C + 1\\) (since \\(y\\) cannot exceed \\(C\\)). The upper bound is the minimum of \\(B\\) and \\(z - B\\) (since \\(y\\) must be at least \\(B\\)).\n4. **Counting Valid Pairs**: For each valid \\(x\\), the corresponding valid \\(y\\) values are those from \\(B\\) to the minimum of \\(C\\) and \\(z - x\\). The number of valid \\(y\\) values is then multiplied by the number of valid \\(x\\) values, and the result is accumulated into the total count.\n5. **Output**: The total count of valid triples \\((x, y, z)\\) is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to manageable mathematical calculations, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
