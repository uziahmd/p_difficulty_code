Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов. В самом начале копирования оба прогресс-бара показывают $$$0$$$ процентов.Найдите все такие целые числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно, что существует момент времени, в который оба прогресс-бара одновременно показывают это число. Выведите эти числа в порядке возрастания.\n\n## Input\nВ первой строке задано одно целое число $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — число копируемых файлов.Во второй строке заданы $$$n$$$ целых чисел $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$$$) — размеры файлов в байтах в том порядке, в котором они будут копироваться.\n\n## Output\nВыведите в возрастающем порядке все числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно такие, что существует момент времени, в который на обоих прогресс-барах одновременно показывается это число.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\n### Output\n['0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100', '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100', '0\\n50\\n99\\n100', '0\\n17\\n43\\n44\\n84\\n90\\n99\\n100']\n\n## Note\nВ первом тесте копируется всего один файл, поэтому оба прогресс-бара всегда показывают одинаковые значения.Во втором тесте первый прогресс-бар сразу же уйдёт вперёд, потом сбросится в ноль и начнёт догонять второй прогресс-бар заново. В конце копирования прогресс-бары некоторое время будут показывать одно и то же число.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given n and a list of n integers (file sizes)\n We need to find all integers from 0 to 100 (inclusive) such that there exists a moment when:\n   - The first progress bar (current file) shows p% (i.e., floor(100 * x / a_i) = p for some byte x in the current file)\n   - The second progress bar (total copied data) shows p% (i.e., floor(100 * total_copied / total_size) = p)\n\n However, note that the total_copied is the sum of the entire file so far (including the current one) and the previous ones.\n\n Approach:\n Since the total number of bytes is at most 100*1000 = 100000 (n<=100, each a_i<=1000) but we cannot iterate over each byte (which would be up to 100000 * 100 worst-case, which is acceptable for n=100? Actually worst-case total size is 100000, but we have 100 files, so we could do 100000 * 100 operations which is 10e6 * 100 = 100e6, which is acceptable in Pyton if we optimize by not iterating every single byte for each file? But note: the problem says the files are up to 1000 bytes, and there are at most 100 files -> total bytes is at most 100000. However, we cannot iterate over each byte one by one for each file because then we would do 100000 * 100 (for each byte in the entire process) which is 10e6 * 100? Actually no: the total number of bytes to copy is 100000, but we have 100 files, so we can simulate by going through each file and then each byte in that file.\n\n But note: the problem asks for all p in [0,100] such that there exists a moment with both bars at p.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We know that during the copying of the i-th file (with size a_i), the first progress bar will take on values p1 = 0, 1, 2, ..., 100 (but only the integer percentages) at certain points. Specifically, the first progress bar shows p exactly at bytes x such that:\n   p <= (100*x)/a_i < p+1\n   => ceil((p * a_i)/100) <= x <= floor(((p+1)*a_i - 1)/100)   [But note: we are using floor rounding]\n\n Actually, the condition is: \n   floor(100*x / a_i) = p   <=>   p <= (100*x)/a_i < p+1\n   => x >= ceil((p * a_i + 99) / 100) ? Let's derive:\n\n   p <= (100*x)/a_i < p+1\n   => (p * a_i) <= 100*x < (p+1)*a_i\n   => x >= ceil((p * a_i)/100) and x <= floor(((p+1)*a_i - 1)/100)   [But note: we are dealing with integer x]\n\n Actually, since x is an integer, the condition is:\n   x_min = ceil((p * a_i) / 100.0)   [if (p * a_i) % 100 != 0 then ceil, but actually we can use integer division with care]\n   x_max = (p+1)*a_i // 100 - 1? But wait, we require 100*x < (p+1)*a_i -> x < (p+1)*a_i/100 -> so x_max = floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9)\n\n However, note that the percentage is defined as floor(100*x/a_i). So we have:\n   floor(100*x/a_i) = p   <=>   p <= 100*x/a_i < p+1\n   <=> x in [ceil(p * a_i / 100), floor((p+1)*a_i / 100 - 1e-9)]? \n\n But note: the smallest x that gives p is the smallest integer x such that 100*x >= p*a_i -> x >= ceil(p*a_i/100). However, if p*a_i is divisible by 100, then x_min = p*a_i//100, because then x_min = (p*a_i)//100, and then 100*x_min = p*a_i, so floor(p*a_i/100)=p.\n\n Actually, we can define:\n   x_min = (p * a_i + 99) // 100   [this is ceiling of (p*a_i)/100 without floating point? Because: (p*a_i + 99)//100 is the ceiling of (p*a_i)/100 if p*a_i is positive?]\n   But wait: ceiling of (p*a_i)/100 is (p*a_i + 99) // 100? Example: p*a_i=500 -> 500/100=5 -> ceil(5)=5, (500+99)//100 = 599//100=5 -> correct.\n   However, note: the condition is x must be at least ceil(p*a_i/100). But then the upper bound: x must be less than (p+1)*a_i/100. So the maximum x is floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9). But note: we can also write as (p+1)*a_i - 1 // 100? \n\n   Actually, the condition is: 100*x < (p+1)*a_i  -> x <= (p+1)*a_i/100 - epsilon, so the maximum integer x is floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9). Alternatively, we can use integer arithmetic: the largest x is floor(((p+1)*a_i - 1)/100). Why?\n        We require 100*x < (p+1)*a_i  -> x < (p+1)*a_i/100. Then the maximum integer x is floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9) = floor((p+1)*a_i - 1)/100? Not exactly.\n\n   Let me check: \n        We want the maximum x such that 100*x < (p+1)*a_i.\n        Then x <= (p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9, so x_max = floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9) = (p+1)*a_i - 1 // 100? \n\n   Actually, we can compute:\n        x_min = (p * a_i + 99) // 100   [ceiling of (p*a_i)/100]\n        x_max = (p+1)*a_i // 100 - 1? \n\n   But wait: \n        Condition: 100*x < (p+1)*a_i  -> x < (p+1)*a_i/100. Then the largest integer x is floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9) = (p+1)*a_i // 100 - (1 if (p+1)*a_i % 100 != 0 then we don't subtract, wait no: \n        Actually, if we do integer floor division, then:\n            floor((p+1)*a_i/100) is the greatest integer <= (p+1)*a_i/100, but we require strictly less? \n\n        Example: p+1=1, a_i=100 -> (p+1)*a_i/100 = 1.0, then we want x < 1.0 -> x<=0. So the maximum x is 0. But (p+1)*a_i//100 = 1, then 1-1=0 -> that works.\n\n        Example: p+1=1, a_i=101 -> (p+1)*a_i/100 = 1.01, then we want x < 1.01 -> x<=1. floor(1.01)=1, then 1-1=0 -> but wait, x=1: 100*1=100 < 101 -> so x=1 is valid. But our formula: (p+1)*a_i//100 = 101//100=1, then 1-1=0 -> so x_max=0, but x=1 is valid. So this does not work.\n\n   Instead, we can use:\n        x_min = (p * a_i + 99) // 100\n        x_max = min(a_i - 1, (p+1)*a_i - 1 // 100)   -> no, that doesn't help.\n\n   Alternatively, note that x must be at most a_i-1 (because we haven't finished the file). And the condition from the second part is that the total data must be such that floor(100 * total_data / total_size) = p.\n\n   However, we can consider simulating by file and by the possible p values. But note: we are only asked for the p values that appear at the same time.\n\n   Another idea: we can iterate over the files and for each file, we can record the set of p values that the first progress bar can show during the copying of that file. Then, for each p, we must check if at the moment when the first progress bar is at p (in the current file) the second progress bar is also at p.\n\n   Steps:\n      Let total_size = sum(a_i)\n      We'll simulate file by file.\n\n      For the i-th file (with size a_i), we can consider that we are copying from 0 to a_i bytes.\n\n      The first progress bar at byte x (0<=x<=a_i) is p1 = floor(100*x/a_i)\n\n      The second progress bar at that moment is: \n          total_copied_so_far = (sum of all previous files) + x\n          p2 = floor(100 * total_copied_so_far / total_size)\n\n      We are interested in the x for which p1 = p2.\n\n      However, we cannot iterate over all x from 0 to a_i (which is up to 1000) for each file (n<=100) and then for each p (from 0 to 100) and check if we have seen p? That would be 100 * 1000 * 100 = 10e6 * 100? Actually 100*1000=100000 per file, and 100 files -> 10000000, which is 10 million, acceptable in Python.\n\n      But wait: the problem says the file sizes are up to 1000 and there are up to 100 files, so total_size is at most 100000, and the total number of bytes is 100000, so we can do:\n\n          Let prefix_sum[i] = a_0 + a_1 + ... + a_{i-1} (the total size of all files before the i-th file)\n\n          Then for the i-th file (0-indexed), the total data after copying x bytes of this file is: prefix_sum[i] + x.\n\n          We require that floor(100*x/a_i) = floor(100*(prefix_sum[i]+x)/total_size) = p.\n\n      However, note: we are iterating over x from 0 to a_i (each byte). There are at most 1000 * 100 = 100000 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n      But note: we are only asked for the distinct p values (from 0 to 100) that appear at the same time.\n\n      We can do:\n\n          Let S = set()   # This will collect all p that satisfy the condition.\n\n          total_size = sum(a)\n          prefix = 0\n          for i in range(n):\n              a_i = a[i]\n              # Now, we are going to simulate the i-th file, which has size a_i.\n              # The current file's prefix_sum is prefix (the total of all previous files)\n              for x in range(0, a_i+1):   # x from 0 to a_i (we include the entire file)\n                  # But note: at x=0, we start the file, so we have already copied prefix (so the second progress bar was at the end of the previous file) and now we are starting the current file.\n\n                  # First progress bar: floor(100*x / a_i)\n                  p1 = (100 * x) // a_i   # floor division\n\n                  # Second progress bar: total_copied = prefix + x\n                  total_copied = prefix + x\n                  p2 = (100 * total_copied) // total_size\n\n                  # If p1 equals p2, then we found a p value (p1) that is achieved simultaneously.\n                  if p1 == p2:\n                      # But note: we are iterating over x, and the same p might appear multiple times. We want distinct p.\n                      # We can add p1 to a set.\n                      S.add(p1)\n\n              prefix += a_i   # update the prefix for the next file\n\n          Then, we output all numbers in S that are between 0 and 100 (they should be, but we can filter) in increasing order.\n\n      However, note: the above simulation includes x from 0 to a_i. But note that at the beginning of the file (x=0) we are still at the same state as the end of the previous file. But the problem says \"after each byte\", so including the start of the file (x=0) is allowed? \n\n      But note: the example input: ['1\\n6'] -> outputs [0,16,33,50,66,83,100]. \n\n      Let's test with n=1, a=[6]:\n          total_size=6, prefix=0.\n          Iterate x from 0 to 6.\n\n          x=0: p1 = (0)//6 = 0, p2 = (0)//6 = 0 -> add 0.\n          x=1: p1 = 100//6 = 16 (floor(100/6)=16), p2 = (100*1)//6 = 16 -> add 16.\n          x=2: p1 = 200//6 = 33 (since 200//6 = 33.3... -> 33), p2 = (200)//6 = 33 -> add 33.\n          x=3: p1 = 300//6 = 50, p2 = (300)//6 = 50 -> add 50.\n          x=4: p1 = 400//6 = 66, p2 = (400)//6 = 66 -> add 66.\n          x=5: p1 = 500//6 = 83, p2 = (500)//6 = 83 -> add 83.\n          x=6: p1 = 600//6 = 100, p2 = (600)//6 = 100 -> add 100.\n\n          Then we output sorted(S) -> [0,16,33,50,66,83,100] which matches.\n\n      But wait: what about the second example? \n          Input: '2\\n100 500'\n          Expected Output: '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100'\n\n      Let's simulate:\n\n          total_size = 600\n\n          File1: size=100, prefix=0\n            x from 0 to 100:\n              x=0: p1=0, p2=0 -> add 0.\n              x=1: p1 = (100*1)//100 = 1, p2 = (100*1)//600 = 0 -> skip.\n              ...\n              x=500: we don't go to 500 because the first file is only 100. So we only go from 0 to 100.\n\n            After file1, we have prefix=100.\n\n          File2: size=500, prefix=100\n            We iterate x from 0 to 500.\n\n            Note: the second progress bar uses total_copied = 100+x, and total_size=600.\n\n            We are looking for x (from 0 to 500) such that:\n                p1 = (100*x)//500\n                p2 = (100*(100+x))//600\n\n            We need to find the p values (from 0 to 100) that occur at the same time.\n\n            Example: let's check for p=95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\n            Consider p=99 in the second file:\n\n                Condition for p1: (100*x)//500 = 99  => 99 <= (100*x)/500 < 100\n                    => 99*500 <= 100*x < 100*500\n                    => 49500 <= 100*x < 50000\n                    => 495 <= x < 500\n\n                Now, check the second condition: (100*(100+x))//600 = 99\n                    => 99 <= (100*(100+x))/600 < 100\n                    => 99*600 <= 100*(100+x) < 100*600\n                    => 59400 <= 100*(100+x) < 60000\n                    => 594 <= 100+x < 600\n                    => 59400 <= 10000 + 100*x < 60000\n                    => 49400 <= 100*x < 50000\n                    => 494 <= x < 500\n\n                So for x in [495, 499] (from the first condition) and [494,499] (from the second condition) -> the intersection is [495,499]. So there is an x (e.g., 495) that satisfies both.\n\n            Similarly, we can check for other p.\n\n            However, note: the simulation will check every x from 0 to 500. The set S will collect:\n\n                In file1: we got p=0, and then from x=1 to 99: p1=0,1,...,99? Actually no:\n\n                    For file1 (100 bytes): \n                        p1 = (100*x)//100 = x (if x is integer, then 100*x//100 = x) but wait: \n                            x=0 -> 0\n                            x=1 -> 1\n                            ... \n                            x=99 -> 99\n                            x=100 -> 100\n\n                    But wait, the second condition for file1: \n                        p2 = (100*(0+x))//600 = (100*x)//600.\n\n                    For example, at x=99: \n                        p1 = 99, p2 = (100*99)//600 = 9900//600 = 16 (since 9900//600 = 16.5 -> floor is 16) -> not 99.\n\n                    So in file1, we only get p=0 (at x=0) and then when x>=1, p1=x but p2=floor(100*x/600) which is less than x until x>=6? \n\n                    Actually, for x=0: 0, then x=1: p1=1, p2=0 -> not equal; x=2: p1=2, p2= floor(200/600)=0; ... until x=6: p1=6, p2= floor(600/600)=1 -> not equal. Then x=6: p1=6, p2=1 -> not equal.\n\n                    How do we get the p=95,96,97,98,99,100? They must come from the second file.\n\n            Therefore, we must run the simulation for all files.\n\n      However, note: the example output includes 0. We did get 0 from the first file.\n\n      Let me check the example: '2\\n100 500' -> expected output: 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\n      Our simulation:\n\n          File1: \n            x=0: p1=0, p2=0 -> add 0.\n            Then for x>=1, we don't get any p1==p2 until the entire first file is copied? Actually, at x=100: \n                p1 = (100*100)//100 = 100, p2 = (100*100)//600 = 16 -> not equal.\n\n          Then file2: \n            We need to check for x from 0 to 500.\n\n            At x=0 (start of second file): \n                p1 = (100*0)//500 = 0, p2 = (100*(100+0))//600 = 100*100//600 = 16 -> not equal.\n\n            Then we look for x such that p1 (from second file) equals p2 (second progress bar).\n\n            We know from the example that 95,96,97,98,99,100 must appear.\n\n            Let's check for p=100 in the second file:\n                Condition for p1: (100*x)//500 = 100 -> x must be 500 (because 100*x must be at least 50000, so x>=500, but x<=500 -> x=500)\n                Then p2 = (100*(100+500))//600 = (100*600)//600 = 100 -> so yes, 100 is added.\n\n            Similarly, for p=99 in the second file:\n                Condition for p1: 99 <= (100*x)/500 < 100 -> 49500 <= 100*x < 50000 -> 495<=x<500 -> x in [495,499]\n                Then p2: 99 <= (100*(100+x))/600 < 100 -> 59400 <= 100*(100+x) < 60000 -> 594 <= 100+x < 600 -> 494<=x<500.\n                Intersection: [495,499] -> so x=495 gives p1= (100*495)//500 = 49500//500 = 99, and p2= (100*595)//600 = 59500//600 = 99 (since 59500//600 = 99.166... -> floor is 99). So yes.\n\n            Similarly for 98,97,96,95.\n\n            But why 95? \n                p1: 95 <= (100*x)/500 < 96 -> 47500 <= 100*x < 48000 -> 475<=x<480.\n                p2: 95 <= (100*(100+x))/600 < 96 -> 57000 <= 100*(100+x) < 57600 -> 570 <= 100+x < 576 -> 470<=x<476.\n                Intersection: [475,475] (only x=475) -> then check: \n                    p1: (100*475)//500 = 47500//500 = 95\n                    p2: (100*(100+475))//600 = (100*575)//600 = 57500//600 = 95 (since 57500/600=95.833..., floor=95) -> yes.\n\n            So indeed, we get 95,96,97,98,99,100 from the second file.\n\n            But wait, why didn't we get 1,2,...,94? \n                In the first file, we only got 0. In the second file, we get p1 from 0 to 100 (as x goes from 0 to 500). However, the second progress bar is computed with the total data (100+x) and total_size=600, so it goes from 100/600 (about 0.166) to 600/600 (1). So the p2 only takes values from 0 to 100, but note that during the second file, the second progress bar starts at 16 (at x=0) and increases to 100.\n\n            We must check: are there any p from 1 to 94 that occur in the second file?\n\n            For example, p=1: \n                p1: (100*x)//500 = 1 -> 1 <= (100*x)/500 < 2 -> 500 <= 100*x < 1000 -> 5<=x<10.\n                p2: (100*(100+x))//600 = 1 -> 1 <= (100*(100+x))/600 < 2 -> 600 <= 100*(100+x) < 1200 -> 6 <= 100+x < 12 -> x in [-94, 1] -> but x>=0, so x=0 or 1.\n\n                But wait, at x=0: p1=0, so not 1. At x=1: p1=(100*1)//500=0, so not 1.\n\n                So no x in [5,9] gives p2=1. \n\n            Similarly, for p=2, etc.\n\n            So the only p that occur are 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\n      Therefore, the simulation by iterating over each file and each byte in that file (from 0 to a_i) and checking if p1==p2 is correct.\n\n      However, note: the problem says \"after each byte\", so we must consider x from 0 to a_i (each integer step). \n\n      But note: the total number of steps is the sum of the file sizes, which is at most 100000, which is acceptable.\n\n      But wait: worst-case total_size is 100000, and we are iterating 100000 * (number of distinct p? No, we are iterating per byte). Actually, the inner loop for a file of size a_i runs a_i+1 times. The total iterations is the sum_{i}(a_i+1) which is total_size + n <= 100000 + 100, which is about 100100, very small.\n\n      However, note: the problem says the file sizes are at least 1, so the worst-case total_size is 100*1000=100000, so the total iterations is 100000+100, which is 100100, which is acceptable.\n\n      But wait: the example input \"4\\n1000 2 2 998\" -> total_size=2002, and the files are 1000,2,2,998 -> total bytes=2002, so the inner loops will run 1001+3+3+999=2006, which is acceptable.\n\n      Therefore, we can implement:\n\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n          total_size = sum(a)\n          prefix = 0\n          s = set()\n\n          for size in a:\n              # For the current file of size `size`\n              for x in range(0, size+1):\n                  # First progress bar: for the current file\n                  p1 = (100 * x) // size   # This is integer floor division\n\n                  # Second progress bar: total_copied = prefix + x\n                  total_copied = prefix + x\n                  p2 = (100 * total_copied) // total_size\n\n                  if p1 == p2:\n                      # Only add if p1 is between 0 and 100 (it is, because p1 is floor(100*x/size) and x<=size, so p1<=100)\n                      s.add(p1)\n\n              prefix += size\n\n          # Now, we have collected all p that appeared. But note: the problem says from 0 to 100, inclusive.\n          # We must output numbers from 0 to 100 that are in the set, in increasing order.\n\n          # However, note: we might have collected p=101? But p1 = (100*x)//size, and x<=size, so (100*x)<=100*size, then (100*x)//size <= 100. So p1 is in [0,100]. Similarly p2 is in [0,100].\n\n          # Convert the set to a sorted list and then output each number on its own line.\n\n          result = sorted(s)\n\n          # But note: the problem expects the numbers in increasing order, but the set might not have all numbers from 0 to 100, only the ones that appeared.\n\n          # However, we must output only the numbers that are in the set.\n\n          for num in result:\n              print(num)\n\n      Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n      Example 1: n=1, a=[6] -> [0,16,33,50,66,83,100] -> matches.\n\n      Example 2: n=2, a=[100,500] -> [0,95,96,97,98,99,100] -> matches.\n\n      Example 3: Input: \"4\\n1000 2 2 998\" -> expected output: \"0\\n50\\n99\\n100\"\n\n      Let's simulate the third example:\n\n          total_size = 1000+2+2+998 = 2002\n\n          File1: 1000\n            We need to check x from 0 to 1000.\n\n            We are particularly interested in p=50,99,100.\n\n            p=50: \n                p1 = (100*x)//1000 = 50 -> 5000 <= 100*x < 5100 -> 50 <= x < 51 -> x=50,51? Actually, 50<=x<51 -> only x=50 (because x integer) -> then p2 = (100*(0+50))//2002 = 5000//2002 = 2 (because 5000//2002 = 2.49... -> floor=2).

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all the percentage values (from 0 to 100) that appear simultaneously on both progress bars during the sequential copying of files. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, while the second progress bar shows the overall percentage of all files copied so far. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves simulating the copying process of each file byte by byte. For each byte copied in a file, we calculate the current progress percentage for the file and the overall progress percentage. If these percentages match at any point during the copying process, we record that percentage.\n2. **Intuition**: By iterating through each file and each byte within the file, we can compute the two progress percentages. The key insight is that for each byte position, the first progress bar's percentage is derived from the current file's size, and the second progress bar's percentage is derived from the cumulative size of all files processed so far.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves a straightforward simulation where we:\n   - Calculate the total size of all files.\n   - For each file, iterate through each possible byte position (from 0 to the file's size).\n   - For each byte position, compute both progress percentages.\n   - If the percentages match, add the value to a set to avoid duplicates.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each byte of each file exactly once. Given that the maximum file size is 1000 bytes and there are up to 100 files, the total operations are manageable (up to 100,000 operations), making the approach efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    total_size = sum(a)\n    prefix = 0\n    s = set()\n    \n    for size in a:\n        for x in range(0, size + 1):\n            p1 = (100 * x) // size\n            total_copied = prefix + x\n            p2 = (100 * total_copied) // total_size\n            \n            if p1 == p2:\n                s.add(p1)\n                \n        prefix += size\n        \n    result = sorted(s)\n    for num in result:\n        print(num)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Initialization**: It calculates the total size of all files and initializes a set to store unique percentage values.\n3. **Simulating Copying Process**: For each file, it iterates through each byte position (from 0 to the file's size). For each position, it calculates the current file's progress percentage (`p1`) and the overall progress percentage (`p2`). If these percentages match, the value is added to the set.\n4. **Output**: After processing all files, the unique percentage values are sorted and printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible points during the copying process where both progress bars show the same percentage, leveraging simple arithmetic and iteration to ensure correctness and optimal performance.",
