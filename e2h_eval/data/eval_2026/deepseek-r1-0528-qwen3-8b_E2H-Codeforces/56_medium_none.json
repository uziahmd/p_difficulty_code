Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers R and B (number of rebels and bases) and then 2R+B points (R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases). We need to check if there exists a perfect matching (one-to-one assignment) between the R rebels and the B bases such that the straight line segments (from base to its assigned spaceship) do not intersect.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" from a base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect. This implies that the entire set of segments must be non-intersecting (except at endpoints).\n\n Since R and B are at most 10, we can try to use a combinatorial approach. But note: the condition is that the matching must be non-intersecting. \n\n Important: The problem is about non-intersecting straight line segments. Also, the bases and spaceships are distinct and no three points are colinear.\n\n Observation: In fact, the problem reduces to whether there exists a non-intersecting matching from the set of bases to the set of rebels. However, note that the problem states that each spaceship is assigned one base and each base one spaceship, so it's a bipartite matching.\n\n But the condition is geometric: the straight lines connecting base i to spaceship j must not cross.\n\n How to solve?\n Since the numbers are small (at most 10 rebels and 10 bases), we can try to generate all perfect matchings? But the number of perfect matchings in a bipartite graph with 10 nodes on each side is 10! which is 3.6 million. But wait, actually we have exactly R bases and R rebels? No: wait, the input has R rebels and B bases. The problem says \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\", and the assignment is perfect meaning every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one base. So we require that R = B? Actually, note: the problem says \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". Therefore, we must have R = B, because otherwise we cannot have a perfect matching.\n\n Let me check the example: \n   Input: \"3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2\"\n   Here R=3, B=3.\n\n   Second example: \"2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1\"\n   Here R=2, B=1 -> so we cannot have a perfect matching (unless we are allowed to leave some rebels unassigned? but the problem says \"each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", meaning all rebels must be assigned. Similarly, all bases must be assigned. So if R != B, then there is no perfect matching.\n\n Therefore, we can first check: if R != B, output \"No\".\n\n Then, if R == B, we have to check if there exists a perfect matching (bijection) between the R bases and the R rebels such that the straight lines connecting each base to its assigned rebel do not intersect.\n\n However, note: the problem does not specify which points are which. We are given:\n   First line: R, B\n   Then R lines: coordinates of rebels\n   Then B lines: coordinates of bases\n\n But wait: the rebels are R and bases are B. And we require R=B for perfect matching. So we can assume R=B.\n\n Now, how to check the non-intersection condition?\n\n We know that two line segments (p1, p2) and (p3, p4) intersect if they are not nested in a proper way. However, note that the entire set of segments must be non-intersecting.\n\n There is a known fact: in a set of non-intersecting line segments that form a matching between two sets (like a bipartition), the segments must form a non-crossing matching. \n\n Moreover, we can use the following idea: \n   Consider the two sets (let's call them A: rebels and B: bases) and we want a non-crossing matching.\n\n One standard way is to use the convex hull or to order the points by x-coordinate (or y-coordinate) and then use dynamic programming for perfect matching (which is O(n^2) but n=10, so we can do DP with state as bitmask, but 2^10=1024 states, and we have two sets of 10 points, but we don't know which is which). Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n Idea: \n   - Sort all the rebels and bases by their x-coordinate (or any coordinate) and then check for non-crossing condition.\n\n However, note: the condition is that the entire set of segments must not cross. \n\n Another idea: \n   We can fix an ordering of the rebels and bases and then check for a non-crossing matching. But note: the problem does not specify which base goes to which rebel.\n\n Standard solution for non-crossing matching (also known as planar matching) can be done by:\n\n  1. Consider the entire set of points (rebels and bases) and sort by x (if tie, by y).\n  2. Then, we can use a recursive method: for the leftmost point (smallest x) we assign it to one of the points (either a rebel or base) and then recursively check the left part and right part.\n\n But wait: we have two sets. We need to assign rebels to bases. \n\n However, note: the problem does not specify which set is on which side. Actually, we can consider:\n\n  We have two sets: R (rebels) and B (bases). We want to assign each base to a unique rebel and vice versa, and the segments must not cross.\n\n We can also use the following theorem: \n   Two edges (a-b) and (c-d) cross if and only if the four points are in alternating order. \n\n Steps:\n\n  We can try to find a matching that is non-crossing. Since the numbers are small, we can iterate over all permutations? But R=B=10, so 10! is about 3.6e6, which is acceptable in Python if we code carefully.\n\n However, we must check the non-intersection condition for the entire matching. But note: the entire matching has R segments, and we must ensure that no two segments cross. \n\n But note: the condition is that the segments do not intersect. How to check for two segments (p1, p2) and (p3, p4) in the plane? We can use the standard orientation test (cross product) to see if two segments intersect.\n\n However, the problem says: \"any two (straight) paths\" meaning every pair of segments (from a base to its assigned rebel) must not intersect. But note: the endpoints are distinct and no three points colinear, so two segments either intersect at an interior point or not.\n\n But wait: what if we have three bases and three rebels? We have three segments. We must check that none of the three pairs of segments intersect.\n\n However, note: if we have a complete graph and we choose a matching (three edges) then we must check that none of the edges cross.\n\n But note: the entire set of segments must be non-intersecting. However, the matching is a set of edges. The condition is that they don't cross. \n\n How to check two segments (A-B) and (C-D) for intersection?\n   We can use the standard method: check the orientations of the four points. Two segments AB and CD intersect if and only if the points C and D are on opposite sides of AB and A and B are on opposite sides of CD, and the segments are not degenerate.\n\n However, note: the problem says no three points are colinear, so we don't have to worry about degeneracy (like collinear points lying on the same segment).\n\n Steps:\n\n  If R != B, output \"No\".\n\n  Else, let rebels = list of R points, bases = list of B points.\n\n  Then, we need to assign each base to a rebel (a bijection). We can generate all permutations of the rebels for the bases (or vice versa). But note: the assignment is from base to rebel, so we can consider a permutation of the rebels for the bases.\n\n  However, we have two sets: we can label the bases and then assign each base to a unique rebel.\n\n  Let bases = [b1, b2, ..., b_R] (since R=B)\n  Let rebels = [r1, r2, ..., r_R]\n\n  We can create a list of bases and then consider all permutations of indices for rebels. Then for each permutation, we form the matching: base_i is connected to rebel_perm[i].\n\n  Then, we check for every pair of edges (i,j) and (k,l) (with i<k) whether the edge (base_i, rebel_perm[i]) and (base_j, rebel_perm[j]) intersect? Actually, we must check for every unordered pair of edges in the matching. But note: the matching has R edges, and we must check that no two edges cross.\n\n  However, note: the matching is a set of edges. Two edges (i.e., two pairs) that are disjoint (no common vertex) might cross.\n\n  Algorithm for checking two segments (p1, p2) and (p3, p4):\n\n    def segments_intersect(p1, p2, p3, p4):\n        # Check if segments p1-p2 and p3-p4 intersect.\n        # We'll use the orientation method.\n\n        def orientation(a, b, c):\n            # returns the cross product (b-a) x (c-a)\n            return (b[0]-a[0])*(c[1]-a[1]) - (b[1]-a[1])*(c[0]-a[0])\n\n        o1 = orientation(p1, p2, p3)\n        o2 = orientation(p1, p2, p4)\n        o3 = orientation(p3, p4, p1)\n        o4 = orientation(p3, p4, p2)\n\n        # General case: the segments intersect if the orientations are mixed.\n        # The four points are in order if o1 and o2 have opposite signs and o3 and o4 have opposite signs.\n        if ((o1 > 0 and o2 < 0) or (o1 < 0 and o2 > 0)) and \\\n           ((o3 > 0 and o4 < 0) or (o3 < 0 and o4 > 0)):\n            return True\n\n        # Special cases: if any three points are colinear, but the problem states no three points are colinear, so we don't need to handle that.\n\n        return False\n\n  However, note: the above function might not cover the case when one segment is entirely contained in the other? But we are guaranteed no three points colinear and distinct points, so that doesn't happen.\n\n  But wait: the above function only checks for proper crossing (at interior points). It doesn't check for touching at endpoints? And since the endpoints are distinct and no three colinear, two segments can only intersect at endpoints if they share an endpoint. But in our matching, the endpoints are distinct (the rebels and bases are distinct sets). Therefore, two edges in the matching do not share an endpoint. So we don't have to worry about endpoint intersections.\n\n  However, wait: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" and the assignment is from base to its assigned spaceship. So the endpoints are distinct. Therefore, two segments from the matching do not share an endpoint.\n\n  So the above function should work.\n\n  Then, for a given matching (represented by a permutation), we check all pairs of edges (each edge is a segment from a base to a rebel). We have R edges, so the number of pairs is C(R,2). For each pair, we check if the two segments intersect.\n\n  If we find even one pair that intersects, then this matching is invalid.\n\n  Then we iterate over all permutations (R! which is 10! ~ 3.6e6) and if at least one permutation yields no two segments intersecting, we output \"Yes\". Otherwise, \"No\".\n\n  However, 3.6e6 * (number of pairs to check per matching) * (cost of checking two segments) is acceptable? The number of pairs per matching is C(10,2)=45, and each check is constant time. So 3.6e6 * 45 = 162e6, which is acceptable in Pyton in many cases (if we optimize the inner loop, and use fast operations).\n\n  But note: the problem says |xi|,|yi| <= 10000, and we are doing cross products, which is simple arithmetic.\n\n  However, we must note: the problem says no three points are colinear, so we don't have to worry about the special case in the orientation function.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  1. Read R, B.\n  2. If R != B: print \"No\" and exit.\n  3. Read the next R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases.\n  4. Since R=B, we have R bases and R rebels.\n  5. Create two lists: rebels and bases (each is a list of tuples).\n  6. Generate all permutations of the rebels (so that we can assign base0 to a particular rebel, base1 to another, etc.)\n     Actually, we can also generate all permutations for the bases? But we have two sets. Alternatively, we can fix the bases in order and permute the rebels.\n\n  But note: the bases are given arbitrarily. We don't know their order. However, the condition of non-intersection is independent of the order of drawing. But we must check the entire set of segments.\n\n  Alternatively, we can fix the order of the bases (for example, sort the bases by x-coordinate) and then assign the rebels in a certain order? But the problem does not specify an order.\n\n  However, we can also consider: the problem does not require a particular matching, so we just need to know if there exists one.\n\n  Implementation:\n\n      from itertools import permutations\n\n      rebels = list of R points\n      bases = list of B points (which is R points)\n\n      perms = permutations(rebels)   # This gives all bijections from rebels to ...? Actually, we are going to assign each base to one rebel.\n\n      But note: we have two sets. We want to assign each base to a rebel. We can also think of the matching as a bijection between the two sets.\n\n      We can do:\n\n          for assign in permutations(range(R)): \n          # But wait, we have two lists: bases and rebels. We want to assign base i to rebel [index] where the index is given by a permutation.\n\n      Alternatively, we can label the bases and then assign each base to a rebel. Since the bases are distinct, we can fix the order of bases (say, by their coordinates) and then permute the rebels.\n\n      However, the condition of non-intersection is translation invariant and rotation invariant? Actually, the relative positions matter.\n\n      But note: we are not changing the coordinates, so we can keep the original order of bases as given? Or we can sort the bases by x-coordinate (and if tie, by y) to have a fixed order.\n\n      Why sort? Because the matching condition is independent of labeling. But we have to be consistent. We can sort both the rebels and bases by x (and if tie, y) and then check if the sorted order leads to a non-crossing matching.\n\n      Actually, there is a known fact: non-crossing matchings in a two-colored point set can be found by sorting by x and then using DP or greedy. But here we are going to try all permutations anyway.\n\n      However, we can reduce the number of permutations by fixing the order of one set. But note: the problem does not specify which base goes to which rebel. We must consider all assignments.\n\n      But wait: the condition of non-intersection is about the geometric arrangement. We can fix the bases in increasing x order and then assign the rebels in increasing x order? Not necessarily, because the rebels might be in a different order.\n\n      Alternatively, we can consider: the entire set of points (bases and rebels) can be sorted by x. Then, the non-crossing matching must have the property that the rebels and bases are interleaved appropriately.\n\n      However, we are going to do brute-force over all permutations. Since R is at most 10, we can do:\n\n          from itertools import permutations\n\n          for perm in permutations(range(R)):\n              # Build the matching: base i is connected to rebel[perm[i]]\n              # Then, we have R edges: (bases[0], rebels[perm[0]]), (bases[1], rebels[perm[1]]), ... \n              # Then, check every pair of edges (i, j) with i < j: do the two segments (bases[i], rebels[perm[i]]) and (bases[j], rebels[perm[j]]) intersect?\n\n          If we find one permutation that works, output \"Yes\" and break.\n\n      But note: the bases are given in arbitrary order. We can also fix the order of bases by sorting. However, the problem does not specify an order. But the condition of non-intersection is independent of labeling. So we can sort the bases and then consider permutations of the rebels? \n\n      Actually, we can also fix the order of the bases by sorting (by x, then y) and then consider all permutations of the rebels (in the same coordinate system). But wait, the rebels are given arbitrarily. \n\n      However, we can also sort both the bases and the rebels by x (and if tie, y) and then consider the matching as a permutation between the two sorted lists. But note: the problem does not require the matching to be in increasing order. \n\n      But there is a known fact: if we sort the bases and rebels by x, then a non-crossing matching must satisfy that the matching edges do not cross, and one way to check is to use the following:\n\n          Let the bases and rebels be sorted by x. Then, we can use a greedy method: assign the leftmost base to the leftmost rebel (if they are in the same order) but that might not be the case.\n\n      However, we are doing brute-force. So we can do:\n\n          Step 1: Read R, B. If R != B: print \"No\", else continue.\n\n          Step 2: Read the rebels and bases.\n\n          Step 3: Sort the bases by x (and if tie, by y). Then, we want to assign the sorted bases to the rebels (which we don't sort). But wait, we must consider all assignments. \n\n      Alternatively, we can leave the bases in the given order and permute the rebels. Then, we don't change the relative order of the bases.\n\n      But note: the condition of non-intersection is geometric and depends on the actual coordinates. The order of bases by x might be important. However, if we don't sort, we are considering all assignments. \n\n      But the problem does not specify the order of bases. So we must consider the bases as given and then assign each base (with its given coordinate) to a rebel.\n\n      Therefore, we must use the original bases order.\n\n      However, we can also sort the bases and the rebels independently and then check the matching, but then we have to account for the fact that the original positions are fixed. \n\n      Actually, the brute-force method with permutations is acceptable for R<=10 (10! = 3628800). We can do:\n\n          from itertools import permutations\n          import sys\n\n          data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n          # Parse the integers and then the coordinates.\n\n          idx = 0\n          R = int(data[idx]); B = int(data[idx+1]); idx+=2\n          rebels = []\n          for i in range(R):\n              x = int(data[idx]); y = int(data[idx+1]); idx+=2\n              rebels.append((x, y))\n\n          bases = []\n          for i in range(B):\n              x = int(data[idx]); y = data[idx+1]; idx+=2\n              bases.append((x, y))\n\n          if R != B:\n              print(\"No\")\n              exit(0)\n\n          # Now, we have two lists: bases and rebels (both of length R)\n\n          # Generate all permutations of the rebels (which we will assign to bases in order)\n\n          # But note: the assignment is from base0 to a rebel, base1 to a rebel, etc.\n\n          # We can also consider: we have two sets, and we want to assign each base to a rebel. We can also consider permuting the bases? Actually, we can fix the bases and permute the rebels.\n\n          # However, we can also fix the rebels and permute the assignment (i.e., we are going to assign the i-th base to the rebels_perm[i] rebel.\n\n          # Let's generate all permutations of the indices of rebels.\n\n          from itertools import permutations\n          found = False\n          # Precompute the list of bases (we don't change the order of bases)\n          # For each permutation of rebel indices, we assign base i to rebel[perm[i]]\n\n          # But wait: we have a list of rebels, and we are going to assign the same rebel only once.\n\n          # Let's create a list of base points and then for each permutation of rebels, form the matching.\n\n          for perm in permutations(range(R)):\n              # Build the matching: for each base index i, connect to rebel[perm[i]]\n              # Then, we need to check for every pair of edges (i, j) (i<j) that the segment from bases[i] to rebels[perm[i]] and bases[j] to rebels[perm[j]] do not intersect.\n\n              valid = True\n              # We'll consider all pairs (i, j) with i < j\n              for i in range(R):\n                  for j in range(i+1, R):\n                      # Get the four points: \n                      # base_i = bases[i], base_j = bases[j]\n                      # rebel_i = rebels[perm[i]], rebel_j = rebels[perm[j]]\n\n                      seg1 = (bases[i], rebels[perm[i]])\n                      seg2 = (bases[j], rebels[perm[j]])\n\n                      # Check if these two segments intersect.\n                      if segments_intersect(seg1, seg2):\n                          valid = False\n                          break\n                  if not valid:\n                      break\n\n              if valid:\n                  found = True\n                  break\n\n          if found:\n              print(\"Yes\")\n          else:\n              print(\"No\")\n\n  Now, we need to define segments_intersect(seg1, seg2). Note: seg1 is (A, B) and seg2 is (C, D). But our helper function expects four points.\n\n  We can write:\n\n      def segments_intersect(seg1, seg2):\n          A, B = seg1\n          C, D = seg2\n          return _do_segments_intersect(A, B, C, D)\n\n      def _do_segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n          def cross(o, a, b):\n              return (a[0]-o[0])*(b[1]-o[1]) - (a[1]-o[1])*(b[0]-o[0])\n\n          def sign(x):\n              return 1 if x > 0 else -1 if x < 0 else 0\n\n          # Check the orientations of the four points for the two segments.\n\n          o1 = sign(cross(A, B, C))\n          o2 = sign(cross(A, B, D))\n          o3 = sign(cross(C, D, A))\n          o4 = sign(cross(C, D, B))\n\n          # General case: the segments intersect if the points are in opposite half-planes for both segments.\n          if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n              return True\n\n          # Special cases: collinear? But the problem says no three points are colinear, so we don't need to handle collinear.\n          return False\n\n  However, note: the above function uses the sign and then checks for opposite signs. But wait, the condition for two segments to intersect is:\n\n      (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n\n  But our function above used `!=` which is not the same. Actually, the condition is that the two segments intersect if the orientations are different for the two endpoints of each segment.\n\n  So the corrected version:\n\n      def _do_segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n          def cross(o, a, b):\n              return (a[0]-o[0])*(b[1]-o[1]) - (a[1]-o[1])*(b[0]-o[0])\n\n          def sign(x):\n              return 1 if x > 0 else -1 if x < 0 else 0\n\n          o1 = sign(cross(A, B, C))\n          o2 = sign(cross(A, B, D))\n          o3 = sign(cross(C, D, A))\n          o4 = sign(cross(C, D, B))\n\n          # The two segments intersect if the orientations are different for the two endpoints of each segment.\n          # That is, the points C and D lie on opposite sides of AB, and A and B lie on opposite sides of CD.\n          return (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4)\n\n  However, wait: what if the segments are collinear? The problem states no three points are colinear, so we don't have to worry.\n\n  But note: the above condition is necessary and sufficient for two segments to properly intersect (not at endpoints). However, we must remember that the segments do not share endpoints (because the bases and rebels are distinct sets). Therefore, we don't have to worry about endpoints.\n\n  However, there is a caveat: the above condition is for proper crossing (at interior points). But our segments might be adjacent? Actually, they are not sharing endpoints, so if they cross, the above condition holds.\n\n  But wait: the condition (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4) is the standard condition for proper crossing. \n\n  Let me test with two segments that share an endpoint? But they don't because bases and rebels are distinct. So it's safe.\n\n  However, note: the above function does not check the case when one segment is entirely contained in the other? But with no three colinear, that's impossible.\n\n  Therefore, we can use:\n\n      def segments_intersect(seg1, seg2):\n          A, B = seg1\n          C, D = seg2\n          # Check if the two segments intersect (at an interior point)\n          def cross(o, a, b):\n              return (a[0]-o[0])*(b[1]-o[1]) - (a[1]-o[1])*(b[0]-o[0])\n\n          def sign(x):\n              return 1 if x > 0 else -1 if x < 0 else 0\n\n          o1 = sign(cross(A, B, C))\n          o2 = sign(cross(A, B, D))\n          o3 = sign(cross(C, D, A))\n          o4 = sign(cross(C, D, B))\n\n          return (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n\n  But note: the condition (o1 * o2 < 0) is equivalent to (o1 != o2 and o1,o2 are not zero) but wait: if one of the orientations is zero, then the point is collinear. But the problem says no three points are colinear, so we don't get zeros. Therefore, we can use either.\n\n  However, the problem says no three points are colinear, so we can assume that no point lies on the other segment (except the endpoints, but endpoints are distinct). Therefore, the orientations won't be zero. So we can use:\n\n      return (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n\n  But wait: what if the two segments are adjacent? They are distinct and we are checking all pairs. The condition above is correct.\n\n  However, there is a well-known issue: the standard orientation test for segment intersection requires that the four points are distinct and no three colinear. We meet that.\n\n  But note: the above function does not account for the possibility that the segments might be the same? But the bases and rebels are distinct sets, so the four points are distinct.\n\n  Therefore, we can use the above.\n\n  However, we must be cautious: sometimes the segments might be defined by the same point? But no, because the bases and rebels are distinct.\n\n  Let me test with two segments that do not intersect: e.g., horizontal and vertical.\n\n  Example: \n      Segment1: (0,0) to (1,1)\n      Segment2: (0,1) to (1,0)\n\n      Then, the cross product for A=(0,0), B=(1,1), C=(0,1): \n          cross = (0-0, 1-0) x (1-0, 0-0) -> wait, let me compute:\n\n          Actually, our cross function is: cross(o, a, b) = (a.x-o.x)*(b.y-o.y) - (a.y-o.y)*(b.x-o.x)\n\n          For A=(0,0), B=(1,1), C=(0,1):\n          = (0-0)*(1-0) - (0-0)*(1-0) = 0*1 - 0*1 = 0 -> but wait, this is the orientation of (A,B,C). \n\n          Actually, we are computing the orientation of the triplet (A,B,C). The formula is the same as (B-A)x(C-A).\n\n          Let me recast: (B-A) = (1,1), (C-A)=(0,1). Cross product = 1*1 - 1*0 = 1.\n\n          Similarly, for (A,B,D) where D=(1,0): (B-A)=(1,1), (D-A)=(1,0) -> cross = 1*0 - 1*1 = -1.\n\n          So o1 = 1, o2 = -1 -> opposite.\n\n          Now for (C,D,A): C=(0,1), D=(1,0), A=(0,0): (D-C)=(1,-1), (A-C)=(0,-1) -> cross = 1*(-1) - (-1)*0 = -1.\n          For (C,D,B): (D-C)=(1,-1), (B-C)=(1,-1) -> cross = 1*(-1) - (-1)*1 = -1 - (-1) = 0? Wait, no:\n\n          Actually, B is (1,1). So (B-C) = (1,0) - (0,1)? Wait, no: we are passing A and B as the two endpoints of the segment, and then the third point for orientation.\n\n          Correction: The function _do_segments_intersect is called with seg1 = (A, B) and seg2 = (C, D). Then we compute:\n\n          o1 = orientation of (A,B,C) = cross(A, B, C) = (B-A)x(C-A) = (1,1)x(0,1) = 1*1 - 1*0 = 1.\n\n          o2 = cross(A, B, D) = (B-A)x(D-A) = (1,1)x(1,0) = 1*0 - 1*1 = -1.\n\n          o3 = cross(C, D, A) = (D-C)x(A-C) = (1,-1)x(0,-1) = 1*(-1) - (-1)*0 = -1.\n          o4 = cross(C, D, B) = (D-C)x(B-C) = (1,-1)x(1,0) = 1*0 - (-1)*1 = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\n          Then, (o1 * o2) = 1 * (-1) = -1 < 0 -> true.\n          (o3 * o4) = (-1) * 1 = -1 < 0 -> true.\n\n          So the function returns True, which is correct because the two segments cross.\n\n  Another example: two segments that do not intersect.\n\n      Segment1: (0,0) to (2,2)\n      Segment2: (0,1) to (1,0)\n\n      Check (0,0),(2,2) and (0,1),(1,0)\n\n      o1 = cross((0,0),(2,2),(0,1)) = (2,2)x(0,1) = 2*1 - 2*0 = 2 -> positive.\n      o2 = cross((0,0),(2,2),(1,0)) = (2,2)x(1,0) = 2*0 - 2*1 = -2 -> negative.\n\n      Then, for the other segment: \n          o3 = cross((0,1),(1,0),(0,0)) = (1,-1)x(0,-1) = 1*(-1) - (-1)*0 = -1 -> negative.\n          o4 = cross((0,1),(1,0),(2,2)) = (1,-1)x(2,1) = 1*1 - (-1)*2 = 1 + 2 = 3 -> positive.\n\n      Then, (o1 * o2) = 2 * (-2) = -4 < 0 -> True, and (o3 * o4) = (-1)*3 = -3 < 0 -> True, so the function returns True.\n\n      But wait, do these two segments intersect? Let's plot:\n\n          Segment1: from (0,0) to (2,2) -> the line y=x.\n          Segment2: from (0,1) to (1,0) -> the line y = -x + 1.\n\n          They intersect at (0.5,0.5). So they do intersect.\n\n      Now, let me take two segments that do not intersect.\n\n      Example: \n          Segment1: (0,0) to (2,0)\n          Segment2: (1,1) to (3,1)\n\n      These are two horizontal lines at y=0 and y=1, separated by 1 unit. They do not intersect.\n\n      Compute:\n\n          o1 = cross((0,0),(2,0),(1,1)) = (2,0)x(1,1) = 2*1 - 0*1 = 2 -> positive.\n          o2 = cross((0,0),(2,0),(3,1)) = (2,0)x(3,1) = 2*1 - 0*3 = 2 -> positive.\n\n          Then, (o1 * o2) is positive -> not negative, so condition fails.\n\n          Now, check the other segment:\n\n          o3 = cross((1,1),(3,1),(0,0)) = (2,0)x(-1,-1) = 2*(-1) - 0*(-1) = -2 -> negative.\n          o4 = cross((1,1),(3,1),(2,0)) = (2,0)x(1,-1) = 2*(-1) - 0*1 = -2 -> negative.\n\n          Condition (o3 * o4) is positive (because negative * negative) -> not negative, so condition fails.\n\n          Therefore, returns False.\n\n      So it works.\n\n  However, note: the condition is that the two segments intersect if and only if (o1 * o2 < 0) AND (o3 * o4 < 0). \n\n  But wait: there is an alternative condition: the segments intersect if the two endpoints of one segment are on opposite sides of the other segment, and vice versa.\n\n  So the above function is correct.\n\n  But wait: what if the two segments are colinear and overlapping? The problem states no three points colinear, so we don't have to worry.\n\n  Therefore, we can use the above.\n\n  However, note: the above function uses the sign and then multiplies. We can avoid the sign function by directly comparing the product.\n\n  Revised without sign:\n\n      def _do_segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n          def cross(o, a, b):\n              return (a[0]-o[0])*(b[1]-o[1]) - (a[1]-o[1])*(b[0]-o[0])\n\n          o1 = cross(A, B, C)\n          o2 = cross(A, B, D)\n          o3 = cross(C, D, A)\n          o4 = cross(C, D, B)\n\n          # The segments intersect if the points C and D lie on opposite sides of AB, and A and B lie on opposite sides of CD.\n          return (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n\n  But wait: the cross product can be zero. The problem says no three points colinear, so we don't have zeros. Therefore, we can use this.\n\n  However, to be safe, we can still check for zeros? The problem says no three points colinear, so we don't need. But let me use the direct product.\n\n  But note: the cross product can be negative, positive, or zero. The condition (o1 * o2 < 0) means one positive and one negative. But if one is zero, then the product is zero and the condition fails. And that's what we want: if a point is colinear (which shouldn't happen) then we don't consider it as opposite.\n\n  Since the problem says no three colinear, we are safe.\n\n  Final code structure:\n\n      import sys\n      from itertools import permutations\n\n      def main():\n          data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n          if not data:\n              print(\"No\")\n              return\n\n          # Parse the first two integers\n          R",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between a set of Rebel spaceships and bases such that the straight-line segments connecting each base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect. The solution involves checking all possible perfect matchings (bijections) between the two sets and verifying the non-intersection condition for each.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires checking if a perfect matching exists between two sets of points (rebels and bases) such that no two connecting segments intersect. Given the constraints (R and B are at most 10), a brute-force approach is feasible.\n2. **Key Insight**: For a perfect matching to exist, the number of rebels must equal the number of bases. If they differ, output \"No\" immediately.\n3. **Brute-Force Matching**: Generate all permutations of assigning bases to rebels. For each permutation, check if any pair of segments intersects. If a valid permutation is found where no segments intersect, output \"Yes\"; otherwise, output \"No\".\n4. **Segment Intersection Check**: Use the cross product method to determine if two line segments intersect. This involves checking the orientations of the endpoints relative to each segment to ensure they lie on opposite sides.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    idx = 0\n    R = int(data[idx])\n    B = int(data[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    \n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x = int(data[idx])\n        y = int(data[idx+1])\n        idx += 2\n        rebels.append((x, y))\n        \n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x = int(data[idx])\n        y = int(data[idx+1])\n        idx += 2\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        \n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    def cross(o, a, b):\n        return (a[0] - o[0]) * (b[1] - o[1]) - (a[1] - o[1]) * (b[0] - o[0])\n    \n    def segments_intersect(seg1, seg2):\n        A, B = seg1\n        C, D = seg2\n        o1 = cross(A, B, C)\n        o2 = cross(A, B, D)\n        o3 = cross(C, D, A)\n        o4 = cross(C, D, B)\n        return (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n        \n    found = False\n    for perm in permutations(range(R)):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                seg1 = (bases[i], rebels[perm[i]])\n                seg2 = (bases[j], rebels[perm[j]])\n                if segments_intersect(seg1, seg2):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n                \n        if valid:\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    print(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The input is read and parsed into integers R (number of rebels) and B (number of bases). The subsequent lines provide the coordinates of the rebels and bases.\n2. **Initial Check**: If the number of rebels does not match the number of bases, the answer is immediately \"No\" since no perfect matching can exist.\n3. **Cross Product Calculation**: The `cross` function computes the cross product of vectors OA and OB, which helps determine the orientation of three points.\n4. **Segment Intersection Check**: The `segments_intersect` function uses the cross product to check if two segments intersect by verifying that their endpoints lie on opposite sides of each other.\n5. **Permutation Check**: All permutations of assigning bases to rebels are generated. For each permutation, every pair of segments is checked for intersection. If any permutation yields no intersections, \"Yes\" is printed; otherwise, \"No\" is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible matchings and ensures geometric constraints are met, leveraging combinatorial generation and geometric properties to solve the problem.",
