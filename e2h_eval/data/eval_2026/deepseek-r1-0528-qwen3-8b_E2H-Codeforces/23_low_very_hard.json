            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three tiles. We can draw any number of extra tiles (each draw adds one tile) and we can choose any tile.\n\n We want the minimum number of draws so that we have at least one mentsu (which is either a koutsu or a shuntsu).\n\n Since we start with 3 tiles, we can consider:\n\n 0 draws: if the hand already has a mentsu.\n\n 1 draw: if after drawing one tile we can form a mentsu.\n\n 2 draws: if after drawing two tiles we can form a mentsu.\n\n But note: we might have multiple possibilities and we are allowed to draw any tiles arbitrarily (including duplicates). \n\n However, note that the problem is small: only three initial tiles. So we can consider:\n\n Option 1: Check if we already have a mentsu (0 draws).\n\n How?\n   - For koutsu: check if there are three identical tiles? (same string)\n   - For shuntsu: check if there is a sequence of three in the same suit and consecutive numbers.\n\n But note: [5p, 4p, 6p] is a shuntsu (can be rearranged to [4p,5p,6p]), but [9m, 1m, 2m] is not (because 9,1,2 are not consecutive in the natural order? Actually, the problem states: sequential numbered tiles. The example says [9m,1m,2m] is not. So we must have consecutive numbers without wrapping.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check for 0 draws.\n\n 2. If not, check for 1 draw: by considering drawing one tile, then forming a mentsu.\n\n    Possibilities for a mentsu from 4 tiles? Actually, we are going to have 4 tiles. But note: we don't require the entire hand to be the mentsu, just having at least one mentsu.\n\n    However, note: we can also have more than three tiles, but the problem says \"at least one mentsu\". The mentsu is defined as a triplet or a sequence (three tiles). \n\n    We can think: with 4 tiles, we can form a mentsu if we can pick three tiles that form a koutsu or shuntsu.\n\n    Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n    After drawing one tile, we have 4 tiles. But note: we are allowed to use the drawn tile arbitrarily and we can choose which tile to draw.\n\n    We need to check: Is there a tile we can draw such that in the set of 4 tiles, there exists a mentsu?\n\n    However, note: the problem asks for the minimum number of draws. So if we can form a mentsu in 1 draw, then we output 1.\n\n    But note: sometimes drawing one tile might form a mentsu in two different ways, but we don't care about the entire hand, just the existence of one mentsu.\n\n 3. Similarly, for 2 draws: we can draw two tiles, then we have 5 tiles. Then we can form a mentsu.\n\n However, note: we might form a mentsu even without using all the tiles. So we just need one set of three tiles that form a mentsu.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that we use the entire hand. We just need at least one mentsu.\n\n However, the hand size increases as we draw, so we can consider:\n\n 0 draws: 3 tiles -> check if there's a mentsu (triplet or sequence)\n\n 1 draw: 4 tiles -> we choose one tile arbitrarily, then check if there's any mentsu (triplet or sequence) in the 4 tiles.\n\n 2 draws: 5 tiles -> similarly.\n\n But note: we are allowed to draw any tiles arbitrarily. So we can choose the best ones.\n\n However, the problem is asking the minimum number of draws. So we can break when we find the minimal draws.\n\n But note: the problem is very small (initially 3 tiles). We can consider:\n\n - 0 draws: check the three tiles.\n\n - 1 draw: we consider drawing one tile (any tile). There are 27 types (digits 1-9 and suits m,p,s). We can try each one and see if in the set of four tiles we have a mentsu.\n\n - 2 draws: similarly, we can try two draws? But note: we are allowed to draw two tiles arbitrarily. However, we are looking for the minimum. So if we can do it in 1, we don't need to check 2.\n\n However, we must consider that sometimes 1 draw might not be sufficient, then we check 2.\n\n But wait: is 2 always sufficient? Actually, no: wait, let me think.\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that her hand contains at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu). The solution involves checking all possible scenarios from 0 to 2 draws, as these are the only possibilities needed to form a mentsu with three initial tiles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for 0 draws**: The hand already contains a mentsu. This can be either:\n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles.\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive numbered tiles of the same suit.\n\n2. **Check for 1 draw**: If no mentsu exists in the initial hand, check if drawing any single tile can form a mentsu. This involves considering all 27 possible tiles (digits 1-9 and suits m, p, s) and verifying if adding any one of them results in a triplet or sequence.\n\n3. **Check for 2 draws**: If no solution is found with 1 draw, then check if drawing two tiles can form a mentsu. This involves generating all possible pairs of tiles and checking if combining them with the existing hand forms a triplet or sequence.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    tiles = [t for t in data]\n    \n    # Check for 0 draws\n    if has_mentsu(tiles):\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Check for 1 draw\n    all_tiles = [\"1m\", \"2m\", \"3m\", \"4m\", \"5m\", \"6m\", \"7m\", \"8m\", \"9m\",\n                 \"1p\", \"2p\", \"3p\", \"4p\", \"5p\", \"6p\", \"7p\", \"8p\", \"9p\",\n                 \"1s\", \"2s\", \"3s\", \"4s\", \"5s\", \"6s\", \"7s\", \"8s\", \"9s\"]\n    \n    for t in all_tiles:\n        new_hand = tiles + [t]\n        if has_mentsu(new_hand):\n            print(1)\n            return\n\n    # Check for 2 draws\n    for i in range(len(all_tiles)):\n        for j in range(i, len(all_tiles)):\n            new_hand = tiles + [all_tiles[i]] + [all_tiles[j]]\n            if has_mentsu(new_hand):\n                print(2)\n                return\n\n    print(3)\n\ndef has_mentsu(hand):\n    if len(hand) < 3:\n        return False\n        \n    # Check for koutsu (triplet)\n    from collections import Counter\n    count = Counter(hand)\n    for tile, cnt in count.items():\n        if cnt >= 3:\n            return True\n            \n    # Check for shuntsu (sequence)\n    hand_dict = {}\n    for tile in hand:\n        suit = tile[1]\n        num = int(tile[0])\n        if suit not in hand_dict:\n            hand_dict[suit] = []\n        hand_dict[suit].append(num)\n        \n    for suit, nums in hand_dict.items():\n        nums_sorted = sorted(set(nums))\n        n = len(nums_sorted)\n        for idx in range(n - 2):\n            if nums_sorted[idx+1] == nums_sorted[idx] + 1 and nums_sorted[idx+2] == nums_sorted[idx] + 2:\n                return True\n                \n    return False\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check (0 draws)**: The function `has_mentsu` checks if the hand already contains a triplet or a sequence. A triplet is identified by counting occurrences of each tile, while a sequence is found by sorting unique numbers of each suit and checking for three consecutive numbers.\n2. **Single Draw Check**: For each possible tile (27 combinations), the code checks if adding it to the hand creates a mentsu. If found, it prints 1 and exits.\n3. **Double Draw Check**: If no solution is found with one draw, the code checks all pairs of tiles (27*27 combinations). If adding any pair forms a mentsu, it prints 2 and exits.\n4. **Fallback**: If even two draws do not suffice, the code defaults to printing 3, though theoretically, three draws should always form a mentsu (e.g., by completing a triplet).\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible minimal draws required, leveraging combinatorial generation and sequence checks to ensure correctness.",
