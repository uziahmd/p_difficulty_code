The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is of size w x h (rows x columns).\n We are to add k gilded rings. The first ring goes along the edge of the plate (which is the outer border). \n Each subsequent ring is 2 cells away from the edge, and has a width of 1 cell.\n\n The i-th ring (with i starting at 1) is drawn on the inner rectangle of size:\n   (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1))\n\n However, note that the ring itself is the border of that inner rectangle. The number of cells in the border of an a x b rectangle is:\n   If a >= 3 and b >= 3: then the border (the outer ring) has 2*a + 2*b - 4 (because the four corners are counted twice).\n\n But note: the problem states that the first ring is the entire outer edge of the original plate, so for the first ring we use the original dimensions.\n\n However, the example: \n   Input: \"3 3 1\" -> Output: 8. \n   For a 3x3: the border is 3*4 - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8? Actually, the formula for the border of a rectangle a x b is 2*(a+b) - 4 (since each side has a cells, but corners are shared). \n   Alternatively, think: top and bottom: a * 2, left and right: (b-2)*2, so total = 2*a + 2*(b-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n So for the first ring (i=1): \n   a0 = w, b0 = h -> cells = 2*w + 2*h - 4.\n\n But wait, what if we have multiple rings? The second ring would be for the rectangle of size (w-4) x (h-4), and the third ring would be (w-8) x (h-8), etc.\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: \"7 9 2\" -> Output: 40.\n\n Let's break down for 7x9 and 2 rings:\n\n Ring 1: \n   w1 = 7, h1 = 9 -> cells1 = 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 30+? Actually: 14+18=32, minus 4 is 28.\n\n Ring 2:\n   w2 = 7 - 4*(2-1) = 7-4 = 3, h2 = 9 - 4*(2-1)=5. But wait, the condition says k must be at least 1 and at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). For w=7, h=9: min(w,h)=7, (7+1)/4 = 8/4=2 -> so k=2 is allowed.\n\n Now, for the second ring, the rectangle is 3x5. The border of a 3x5 is: 2*3 + 2*5 - 4 = 6+10-4 = 12.\n\n Then total gilded cells = 28 (first ring) + 12 (second ring) = 40.\n\n But wait, why does the example input \"7 9 1\" give output 28? That matches the first ring.\n\n However, let's check the example \"3 3 1\": \n   w=3, h=3, k=1.\n   First ring: 2*3+2*3-4 = 6+6-4 = 8. Correct.\n\n But note: the problem says the rings are drawn on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). \n\n However, there is a catch: the rings are drawn by removing the previous ones? Actually, no: the problem says the first ring goes along the edge, the second one 2 cells away, etc.\n\n How do we compute the total?\n\n We can iterate for each ring i from 1 to k, and for the i-th ring:\n   Let w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n   Let h_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   The ring is the border of the rectangle of size w_i x h_i, but note: if either w_i or h_i becomes less than 3, then that ring might not exist? \n\n According to the input constraint: k is at most floor((min(n, m)+1)/4). This ensures that for the k-th ring, we",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. The first ring is placed along the edge of the plate, and each subsequent ring is positioned 2 cells away from the previous one, with a width of 1 cell. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that each ring corresponds to the border of an inner rectangle. The dimensions of the rectangle for the i-th ring are given by (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). The number of cells in the border of an a x b rectangle is calculated as 2*a + 2*b - 4, provided both a and b are at least 3. If either dimension is less than 3, the ring cannot be formed, but the problem constraints ensure this does not happen for valid inputs.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle. Then, use the formula 2*a + 2*b - 4 to find the number of cells in that ring's border. Sum these values for all k rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each ring exactly once, leading to a time complexity of O(k), which is efficient since k is constrained by the input dimensions (up to about 25 for the largest possible plate).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    w, h, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    total_cells = 0\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        a = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n        b = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n        if a < 3 or b < 3:\n            break\n        total_cells += 2 * a + 2 * b - 4\n    print(total_cells)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: w (width), h (height), and k (number of rings). These values are read from standard input.\n2. **Initialization**: A variable `total_cells` is initialized to zero to accumulate the sum of cells for all rings.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k:\n   - Calculate the dimensions of the inner rectangle for the current ring by reducing the original width and height by 4*(i-1) cells.\n   - Check if the dimensions are sufficient (at least 3) to form a ring. If not, break the loop as further rings would not be valid.\n   - Compute the number of cells in the current ring using the formula 2*a + 2*b - 4 and add it to `total_cells`.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all valid rings, the accumulated `total_cells` is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the total number of gilded cells by leveraging simple arithmetic operations and a loop to handle each ring individually, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
