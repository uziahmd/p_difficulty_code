Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented by some substring of S (in Morse code). The catch: not every string of 1 to 4 bits is a valid letter. The invalid ones are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes\" and we map dot to '0' and dash to '1'. And there are 30 possible strings from length 1 to 4, but 4 are invalid.\n\n But note: the substring can be of any length from 1 to 4? Actually, the representation of a letter is at most 4 characters. However, a substring of S might be longer than 4, but we break it into consecutive letters? Or wait, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters\", meaning that we are allowed to split the substring arbitrarily? Actually, no: each English letter is represented by a contiguous substring of 1 to 4 characters. However, if we have a substring that is longer than 4, then we cannot use the entire substring as one letter. But we can break the substring into consecutive letters.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that the entire substring must be broken into letters. It says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\". \n\n This means: we are looking for all ways to take a contiguous substring of S (which is built from the given m appends) and interpret it as a sequence of letters. Each letter is represented by a contiguous segment of 1 to 4 bits. But note: the same substring might be broken in multiple ways, and we count each valid sequence (each valid way to break the substring into letters, where each letter is one of the 26 valid codes).\n\n However, wait: the example input \"3\\n1\\n1\\n1\" (so S becomes \"111\") and the answer is 7.\n\n The example lists:\n   \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"\n\n But note: \n   T -> \"1\"\n   M -> \"11\"\n   O -> \"111\"\n\n Then:\n   \"TT\": two T's -> \"1\" then \"1\" -> \"11\", which is the same as M.\n   \"TM\": \"1\" then \"11\" -> \"111\", same as O.\n   \"MT\": \"11\" then \"1\" -> \"111\", same as O.\n   \"TTT\": \"111\", same as O.\n\n So actually, the same string of bits can represent different sequences of letters? But wait, the example counts distinct sequences of letters? Or distinct ways to break the substring?\n\n Let me read the problem again: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters\". Note that the example counts:\n\n   \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"\n\n But note: \"TT\" is a sequence of two T's. Similarly, \"TM\" is a sequence of T then M. However, the problem does not specify whether sequences are considered distinct by the letters or by the representation. But note: the example output counts 7, and indeed the example lists 7.\n\n However, observe that the same Morse code pattern may appear for multiple letters? Actually, no: the problem states that the invalid ones are excluded, so each valid string of 1 to 4 bits corresponds to a distinct letter. Therefore, the same bit pattern cannot represent two different letters.\n\n But note: the same bit pattern might be broken in two ways that yield the same sequence of letters? Not necessarily: the breaking is fixed by the boundaries of the letters. However, the problem is: we are allowed to take any contiguous substring and break it arbitrarily (as long as each part is 1 to 4 bits and is valid) and then the entire sequence is a sequence of letters.\n\n However, the example counts the same Morse code pattern appearing in different ways as distinct sequences? Actually, note that the example counts:\n\n   \"T\" (from \"1\")\n   \"M\" (from \"11\")\n   \"O\" (from \"111\")\n   \"TT\" (from \"11\" broken as two T's) -> but \"11\" broken as two T's is the same as one M? Then why is \"TT\" counted separately?\n\n Wait, the problem says: \"non-empty sequences of English letters\". Each sequence is a sequence of one or more letters. And the same Morse code pattern (for example \"11\") can be interpreted as either one M or two T's. Therefore, we have two different sequences: [T, T] and [M].\n\n However, note: the example does not list \"MM\" because \"11\" broken as two M's is not possible because M is \"11\", so two M's would require \"1111\", which is not the same as the substring \"11\". \n\n So we are counting distinct sequences of letters (where order matters) that can be obtained by taking a contiguous substring of S and partitioning it into segments (each of length 1 to 4) such that each segment is one of the valid 26 letters.\n\n But note: the same substring might be broken in multiple ways, and each way gives a different sequence (even if the resulting string of letters is the same, but wait: the letters are distinct by their representation? Actually, no: the representation is fixed, but the same letter might appear multiple times. However, the example counts two different sequences: \"TT\" and \"M\", even though they are different sequences of letters.\n\n However, the problem does not say that the sequences are defined by the letters. It says: \"sequences of English letters\". So we are counting distinct sequences (with order) of letters (where each letter is one of the 26). But note: the same letter can appear multiple times and in different orders.\n\n But wait, the example also counts \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", and \"TTT\", etc.\n\n However, note: the example input is small. We are building S one character at a time and we need to output the answer after each step.\n\n Approach:\n\n We are going to use dynamic programming.\n\n Observation: We are building a string S (over {0,1}) of length up to 3000. We need to count the total number of sequences (across all contiguous substrings) that can be broken into valid letters.\n\n But note: the same sequence of letters might be obtained from different contiguous substrings? Actually, the problem says \"some substring\", so we don't care about duplication of the same sequence from different substrings. However, note: the problem does not say distinct sequences. It says \"the number of non-empty sequences\". But wait, the example output for \"3\\n1\\n1\\n1\" is 7. And the example lists 7 distinct sequences: T, M, O, TT, TM, MT, TTT.\n\n However, note: the example does not count duplicate sequences. For instance, the substring \"11\" can be broken as [T,T] and [M]. These are two different sequences. Similarly, the substring \"111\" can be broken as [T,T,T] (three T's), [T,M], [M,T], and [O]. So we are counting distinct sequences (each sequence is a list of letters) that appear at least once as a contiguous substring.\n\n But wait: the problem does not specify whether the same sequence (same list of letters) appearing from two different substrings is counted twice? Actually, the problem says \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\". This suggests that if the same sequence appears in two different substrings, we still count it once? Or do we count duplicates?\n\n However, note: the example does not mention duplicates. Also, the sample outputs are increasing and do not repeat the same sequence.\n\n But consider: the same sequence (like [T, T]) might appear from two different substrings? Actually, no: the sequence [T, T] is two T's. The only way to get two T's is by having two consecutive single-bit T's. But note: the substring \"11\" can be broken as [T, T] (if we break after the first bit) or as [M] (if we break the whole two bits as one letter). But the sequence [T, T] is one specific sequence. However, we can get [T, T] from the substring \"11\" (by breaking at the first bit) and from the substring \"111\" (by breaking the first two bits as T and then the next one as T). But wait, the substring \"111\" has three bits, so breaking the first two as T and then the last one as T is valid.\n\n However, the problem does not say that we are counting distinct sequences. It says \"the number of non-empty sequences\". But note: the same sequence (same list of letters) might be produced by multiple substrings. However, the example counts each distinct sequence only once.\n\n Let me check the example: after \"111\", we have:\n\n   Substrings of length 1: \"1\" -> T (sequence [T])\n   Substrings of length 2: \"11\" -> [T,T] and [M]\n   Substrings of length 3: \"111\" -> [T,T,T], [T,M], [M,T], [O]\n\n Then we have the sequences: [T], [T,T], [M], [T,T,T], [T,M], [M,T], [O] -> 7.\n\n But note: [T] is already obtained from the substring \"1\" (which is the first bit, the second bit, and the third bit). However, we are counting each distinct sequence (the sequence [T] is the same regardless of which substring we take). So we are counting distinct sequences (multisets? no, ordered) that appear at least once.\n\n Therefore, we are to count the set of all sequences (each sequence is an ordered list of letters) that can be formed by breaking some contiguous substring of S (which is built from the given m appends) into valid Morse code letters (each 1 to 4 bits and not one of the four invalid ones).\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the entire substring to be broken. We are allowed to take any contiguous substring and break it arbitrarily (with breaks only at boundaries of 1 to 4 bits). Then we consider the sequence of letters.\n\n But note: the same sequence (like [T, T]) can be obtained from multiple substrings, but we count it only once.\n\n However, the problem does not explicitly say that we should count distinct sequences. Let's look at the example: the output is 7 for the first sample. But if we were to count duplicates, then we would have to count the same sequence multiple times if it appears in multiple substrings. But the example output is 7, and the example lists 7 distinct sequences.\n\n So we are to count distinct sequences (each sequence is an ordered list of letters) that can be formed by any contiguous substring of S.\n\n But wait: the example input \"1\\n1\" (m=1, then append '1') would have:\n   Substring: \"1\" -> [T] (one sequence)\n   So output: 1\n\n Then input \"2\\n1\\n1\" (S=\"11\"):\n   Substrings: \n        \"1\" (first) -> [T]\n        \"1\" (second) -> [T]\n        \"11\" -> [T,T] and [M]\n\n   Now, the sequences we have: [T] (from the first and second) and [T,T] and [M]. But [T] is the same sequence regardless of which substring we take. So we have three distinct sequences: [T], [T,T], [M]. But the example output for the second modification (two appends) is 3.\n\n   However, the provided example output for the first sample (three appends) is 7. And the sample input is:\n\n        Input: ['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n        Output: ['1\\n3\\n7', ... ]\n\n   So after two appends (first two lines: two '1's) we output 3.\n\n   Therefore, we are counting distinct sequences.\n\n But now the problem becomes: we want the set of all sequences (ordered list of letters) that can be obtained by breaking any contiguous substring of S (which is being built) into parts (each part is 1 to 4 bits and is a valid letter).\n\n How to do that?\n\n We cannot iterate over all contiguous substrings (there are O(m^2)) and then try to break them (which is exponential in the length). And m can be up to 3000.\n\n Alternative approach: we want to count the distinct sequences (each sequence is a list of letters) that can be formed by any contiguous substring.\n\n We can use a DP that traverses the string and collects all sequences that end at the current position? But then we have to avoid duplicates and the sequences can be arbitrarily long (but note: the entire substring is at most 3000, but the sequences are built by breaking into letters of 1-4 bits, so the maximum length of a sequence is floor(3000/1)=3000, which is too many).\n\n Alternatively, we can use a state machine that recognizes valid letters and then use automata to generate sequences. However, we are only interested in distinct sequences.\n\n Insight: we are only concerned with contiguous substrings. We can use a rolling hash (or trie) to store the set of sequences that have been seen? But the sequences are composed of letters (each letter is identified by a bit string of 1 to 4 bits). And the same sequence of letters (even if the bit representation is the same) is the same? Actually, the letter is defined by the bit string. But note: two different bit strings (of the same length) are different letters. However, we are breaking the substring arbitrarily, so we can have multiple ways to form the same letter? Actually, no: each letter is uniquely defined by its bit string. But wait, the same letter might be represented by only one bit string. So the sequence is defined by the sequence of letters, and the letters are defined by their bit strings.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that the same letter must be represented by the same bit string? Actually, the representation is fixed: each letter has a fixed representation. There are 26 letters and 30-4=26 valid codes, so each valid code is one letter. So the mapping from the 26 valid codes to letters is fixed.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the mapping. But note: the invalid ones are given: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". The rest are the 26 letters.\n\n But the problem does not specify which 26 letters. However, we don't need the actual letters, just the count. But we need to know which bit strings of length 1 to 4 are valid.\n\n We can precompute the set of valid bit strings (for lengths 1 to 4) excluding the four given.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute a set `valid` of all strings (over {'0','1'}) of length 1,2,3,4 that are not in {'0011','0101','1110','1111'}.\n\n 2. We are building the string S one character at a time. We need to compute the set of all sequences (distinct) that can be formed by contiguous substrings.\n\n However, storing the entire set of sequences (each sequence being a tuple of letters) is too expensive because the number of sequences can be exponential.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n We are only asked for the count modulo 10^9+7.\n\n We can use dynamic programming that, for each position i, stores the set of sequences that end at i? But the sequences can be long and the state space is huge.\n\n Another idea: use a finite automaton that recognizes the sequences (each sequence is broken by the valid codes). Then we can use DP that goes over the string and for each ending position, we know the set of sequences that end there. But the set of sequences is too big.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the idea of suffix automata or suffix tree for the Morse code sequences? \n\n However, note: we are building the string from left to right, and we are only appending one bit at a time. We need to update the set of sequences we can form.\n\n We can use a DP that, for each starting position, we remember the minimal information to extend the sequences.\n\n But note: the sequences are formed by breaking the substring from j to i (for some j<=i) into valid codes. We want to avoid counting the same sequence multiple times.\n\n We can use a DP that for each position i, and for each length L (from 1 to 4) of the last letter, and then combine with previous sequences. But we want distinct sequences.\n\n Alternatively, we can use state machine that breaks the string S into valid letters and then use DP to count the distinct sequences without storing the entire set.\n\n However, note: the same sequence of letters might be formed by different breaking of the same substring? Actually, no: the sequence is defined by the breaking. But wait, the same sequence (same list of letters) can be formed by different substrings. But we are only concerned with distinct sequences.\n\n We are to count the distinct sequences (each sequence is an ordered list of letters) that appear at least once.\n\n We can use a DP that, for each ending index i, we store the set of sequences (as a hashable representation) that end at i. Then we combine these sets for all i from 0 to n-1 and then take the union. But the length of the string is up to 3000, and the sequences can be very long (theoretically up to 3000/1 = 3000 letters). We cannot store sets of sequences.\n\n Another idea: use a DP that counts the number of distinct sequences that end at each position, but we must account for the fact that the same sequence might be generated by two different substrings ending at the same position? Actually, no: we are breaking the substring arbitrarily, and the same sequence of letters (say [A,B]) is independent of the breaking. But wait, the breaking is determined by the bit string. However, the same sequence [A,B] must be formed by the same concatenation of the two letters A and B. And the bit representation of A and B is fixed.\n\n However, note: the same sequence [A,B] might be formed by two different substrings: one from j to i (with j to j+len(A)-1 = A, and then j+len(A) to i = B) and another from k to i (with k to k+len(A)-1 = A, and then k+len(A) to i = B). But if the same sequence [A,B] is formed by two different substrings, then we count it only once.\n\n We are required to count distinct sequences.\n\n We can use a trie-like structure to store the sequences we have encountered, but the total number of sequences might be exponential.\n\n Another idea: use DP with state (i, j) meaning: we are at position i and we are trying to form a sequence of length j (the whole sequence so far)? No.\n\n Insight from string matching: we can use a state machine that matches the valid codes and then use a DP that goes from left to right and for each position i, we store the set of sequences that end at i. But storing sets of sequences is too heavy.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a DP that counts the distinct sequences (without storing them) by using the fact that the sequences are built from a fixed alphabet (the 26 letters). But we don't know the mapping from the bit strings to letters, but we know which bit strings are valid.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the actual letters, but we can work with the bit strings. But the same letter always maps to the same bit string. So the sequence is defined by the bit string? Actually, no: the sequence is defined by the letters, and the letters are defined by the bit strings. But we are not told which bit string corresponds to which letter, but we know which bit strings are valid. However, the problem does not require the mapping.\n\n But wait: the same sequence of letters will always be represented by the same sequence of bit strings. So two different sequences of letters (different in at least one letter) will have different representations (as concatenation of the bit strings). Therefore, the set of sequences (as bit strings) is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of sequences of letters. However, we must avoid the four invalid ones.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require to output the sequences, just the count.\n\n But we are building the string S one bit at a time. We can use a DP that for each position i, and for each possible valid prefix (a string of up to 4 bits) we store the set of sequences (as a hash) that end at i with that prefix? Still too heavy.\n\n We need to count distinct sequences. We can use a DP that for each ending index i, and for each possible way to break the substring ending at i, we record the sequence (as a state). But the state is the entire sequence of letters? That is too long.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the idea of \"state\" being the current suffix (the last few bits, up to 4) and then use a dictionary to store the set of sequences that have been formed (by hashing the entire sequence) but then we cannot because the entire sequence is too long.\n\n Another idea: use inclusion-exclusion and generating functions? But the problem is online (after each append).\n\n We need to design an efficient solution.\n\n After reading the constraints (m up to 3000) and the fact that each letter is 1 to 4 bits, we can use a DP that for each position i, we store the set of sequences (as a hash value) that end at i. But the set of sequences is too large.\n\n However, note: the sequences are built from a fixed alphabet (26 letters) and the length of the sequence is at most 3000/1 = 3000, so the total number of distinct sequences might be very large (exponential in the length). We cannot store them.\n\n Another idea: use a trie of the valid codes and then use a DP that goes over the string and for each position, we store the set of sequences (as a pointer to a node in the trie) that end at this position. But the trie has 26 letters and the depth is the length of the sequence. We are only interested in distinct sequences.\n\n We can use a DP that uses the following:\n\n   Let dp[i] = the set of sequences (each sequence is a tuple of letters) that end at position i.\n\n   But we want to avoid storing the entire set.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a DP that for each position i, stores the set of sequences (as a hash value) that end at i, but then we use a global set to avoid duplicates. However, the total number of sequences might be too many.\n\n But note: the problem says the answers can be incredibly tremendous, so we are to output modulo 10^9+7. That means we don't need the exact set, but we need to count the distinct sequences.\n\n However, we cannot store the entire set of sequences.\n\n Insight: we are only appending one bit at a time. We can use a DP that stores, for each position i, the set of sequences (as a hash) that end at i, but then we use a global structure (like a set) that we update as we add new sequences. But the number of sequences can be exponential.\n\n Example: after n appends, the number of distinct sequences might be exponential in n.\n\n But note: n is up to 3000. And the alphabet size is 26, so the number of distinct sequences is at most 26^k (for sequences of length k) but k can be up to 3000, so 26^3000 is astronomical.\n\n We must find a better way.\n\n Let's change our perspective.\n\n We are to count the distinct sequences (of one or more letters) that appear as contiguous substring in S (broken into valid codes). \n\n This is equivalent to: consider all contiguous substrings of S (which is a binary string) and for each substring, consider all ways to break it into segments of 1 to 4 bits that are valid (i.e., not in the set of four invalid ones). Then the set of all sequences (each sequence is the list of letters) that appear at least once.\n\n But note: the same sequence (as a list of letters) might appear from multiple substrings, but we count it once.\n\n We can use a state machine that recognizes the valid codes and then use a DP that builds sequences and uses a rolling hash for the entire sequence? But we don't know the alphabet of the sequence (it's the 26 letters, but we don't know the mapping from bit strings to letters).\n\n However, note: we don't care about the actual letters, only the distinctness. Two different bit strings (even if they are valid) correspond to different letters. So the sequence of bit strings (that are valid) is what defines the sequence.\n\n But wait: the same sequence of letters must be represented by the same sequence of bit strings. So the sequence of bit strings (without spaces) is what we are breaking from the substring.\n\n But then, the problem reduces to: count the distinct ways to break any contiguous substring of S (which is built) into valid codes (bit strings of length 1 to 4 that are not in the set of four invalid ones) and then consider the entire broken string as a sequence (and we want to count distinct sequences).\n\n However, note: the same sequence of letters is defined by the same sequence of bit strings (because each letter is uniquely represented). Therefore, we can work with bit strings.\n\n But then, we are to count the distinct sequences of valid codes (each code is a string of 1 to 4 bits, and the four given are excluded) that appear as a contiguous substring of S (with breaks between codes). However, note: the breaks are not fixed: we can break a substring arbitrarily as long as each part is 1 to 4 bits and valid.\n\n But wait: the same sequence of codes (as a list of codes) might appear in two different ways (with different breaks) but we are breaking the substring arbitrarily. However, the sequence of codes is defined by the breaks. And two different breaks on the same substring give two different sequences (unless the codes are the same). \n\n Example: substring \"111\" can be broken as [1,1,1] or [1,11] or [11,1] or [111]. These are four different sequences of codes.\n\n But note: the codes are the bit strings. So [1,1,1] is three '1's (each '1' is a valid code for 'E'? Actually, the mapping is fixed, but we don't know the mapping. However, the problem does not require the mapping. But we know which codes are valid.\n\n However, the problem says: \"each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes\", and we map dot to '0' and dash to '1'. And the valid codes are those 26 strings of length 1 to 4 (excluding the four).\n\n So the sequence [1,1,1] is three '1's, and [1,11] is a '1' followed by a '11'. These are two different sequences.\n\n But note: the same sequence of codes (as a list of codes) is defined by the list. And the list is determined by the breaks.\n\n However, the problem counts distinct sequences of letters. And the letter is defined by the code. So if two codes are different, they represent different letters. Therefore, the sequence of codes is the sequence of letters.\n\n So we can work with codes (bit strings) instead of letters.\n\n Therefore, the problem reduces to: count the distinct sequences of valid codes (each code is a string of 1 to 4 bits, and there are 26 valid ones) that appear as a contiguous substring of S (with breaks between codes) and the breaks can be anywhere (as long as the length of each code is between 1 and 4 and the code is valid).\n\n But note: the breaks are not fixed by the substring; we are allowed to break arbitrarily. So we are essentially allowed to take any contiguous substring and then break it into parts of 1 to 4 bits that are valid.\n\n Then, the set of sequences we are counting is the set of all lists of valid codes (each valid code is one of the 26) that appear as a contiguous substring of S (with breaks between codes).\n\n However, the same sequence of codes might appear from two different substrings, but we count it only once.\n\n Example: in the string \"111\", we have:\n   Code sequences: \n        [1] (from substring \"1\")\n        [11] (from substring \"11\")\n        [111] (from substring \"111\")\n        [1,1] (from substring \"11\", broken as two '1's)\n        [1,11] (from substring \"111\", broken as first '1' and then '11')\n        [11,1] (from substring \"111\", broken as first '11' and then '1')\n        [1,1,1] (from substring \"111\", broken as three '1's)\n\n But note: the substring \"11\" can be broken as [1,1] or [11]. So we have two sequences: [1,1] and [11].\n\n And the substring \"1\" gives [1].\n\n And the substring \"111\" gives [1,1,1], [1,11], [11,1], [111].\n\n Now, are there any duplicate sequences? For example, the sequence [1,1] appears only from substring \"11\". The sequence [1] appears from substrings \"1\", \"11\" (if we break the first '1' and then the next '1' is not taken as part of this one) and \"111\" (first '1'). But we are counting distinct sequences, so we count [1] once.\n\n However, note: the sequence [1,1] is different from [11] (which is a sequence of one letter) and from [1] (which is a sequence of one letter). \n\n But wait, the sequence [1,1] is a sequence of two letters, and [11] is a sequence of one letter. They are different.\n\n Therefore, we are to count:\n\n   All sequences (non-empty) that are formed by breaking any contiguous substring (which is a binary string) into valid codes (each 1 to 4 bits and not in the four invalid ones) and we count each distinct sequence (as a list) only once.\n\n Since the mapping from codes to letters is fixed, and the codes are distinct, the sequence of codes is the sequence of letters.\n\n Now, how to count this without enumerating all substrings?\n\n We can use a DP that for each position i, stores the set of sequences (as a hash) that end at i. But the number of sequences ending at i can be large.\n\n However, note: we are only appending one bit at a time. We can use a rolling hash for the entire sequence of codes? But the sequences are defined by the list of codes, and the codes are fixed-length (we don't know the length of each code, but between 1 and 4).\n\n Alternatively, we can use a DP that stores, for each position i, a dictionary mapping from the last few bits (up to 4) to the set of sequences (represented by a hash) that end with that suffix. But then we have to store the entire set of sequences that end at i, which is too heavy.\n\n We need to find a way to count distinct sequences without storing them.\n\n Insight: use a DP that for each position i, and for each possible valid code that ends at i, we can extend the sequences that ended at i - len(code) + 1? But then we have to avoid duplicates.\n\n Another idea: use a state machine that recognizes valid codes and then use a DP that for each position i, stores the set of sequences (as a state in a trie) that end at i. But the trie has exponential states.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a two-dimensional DP: let dp[i] be a set of integers (hash values) representing the distinct sequences that end at position i. Then we update dp[i] from dp[i-1], dp[i-2], dp[i-3], dp[i-4] by appending a valid code of length 1 to 4 that ends at i.\n\n But then, the total number of distinct sequences can be very large, but note: the modulus is 10^9+7, but we are hashing the sequences. However, we are only interested in the count, not the sequences themselves.\n\n But wait, we are to count distinct sequences, so we need to know if a sequence has appeared before. We can maintain a global set `seen` of all sequences (their hash) that have appeared at any position. Then for each position i, we generate new sequences ending at i and if the sequence has not been seen before, we add it to `seen` and increment the count.\n\n However, the number of sequences is exponential, and storing a set of hashes for all sequences is not feasible.\n\n We need a smarter way.\n\n Let f(n) be the total number of distinct sequences we have seen after n modifications.\n\n How does f(n) update when we append a new bit?\n\n When we append a new bit, we extend S to s = S + b.\n\n Then, new sequences are formed by:\n\n   - Any new contiguous substring that ends at the new last bit.\n\n   - These new contiguous substrings are the suffixes of S+b.\n\n   - For each suffix starting at j and ending at n-1 (0-indexed), we try to break it into valid codes.\n\n But we are only interested in distinct sequences.\n\n We can use a DP that stores, for each ending position i, the set of sequences (represented by a hash) that end at i. Then, we take the union of all these sets for all i from 0 to n-1. But the set of sequences is huge.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a DP that stores the last few bits and then uses a dictionary to store the sequences that have been seen for a given state (suffix) and then use a global set for the entire history. But then, the same sequence might be generated from different states.\n\n We need to avoid duplicates.\n\n Insight from known string algorithms: the problem is similar to counting distinct substrings, but here we are breaking the substring into codes and then the sequence is the concatenation of codes.\n\n But note: the breaking is not fixed. We are allowed to break arbitrarily (with breaks only at boundaries of 1 to 4 bits) as long as each code is valid.\n\n This is reminiscent of the problem of counting distinct decompositions of a string into a given alphabet (with variable-length codes). \n\n We can use a DP that for each position i, stores the set of sequences (as a hash) that end at i, and then use a global set to ensure we don't count a sequence twice. But the memory might be too high.\n\n However, note that m is up to 3000. The worst-case number of sequences might be exponential, but we cannot hope to store them.\n\n Another idea: use a DP that doesn't store the sequences but uses the fact that the sequences are built from a fixed set of codes. We can use a finite automaton that recognizes the valid codes and then use a DP that goes over the string and for each position, we store the set of sequences (as a state) that end at that position. But the state is the entire sequence, which is too long.\n\n We need to use the fact that the sequences are built from a fixed set of codes (26 codes) and the breaking is done in segments of 1 to 4 bits.\n\n We can use a DP that for each position i, and for each possible valid prefix (the last 1 to 4 bits) and then store the set of sequences (as a pointer to a node in a trie) that end at i with that prefix. But then we are storing the entire sequence.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a rolling hash for the entire sequence of codes, but the challenge is that the codes are of variable length.\n\n Let's define a hash for a sequence of codes: \n\n   Let H(seq) = (code1 || code2 || ... || codek) treated as a binary string and then hashed. But the length of the binary string is variable.\n\n But we can concatenate the codes (which are binary strings) and then use a base that is (2^32) or something, but the length of the concatenated string is up to 3000*4 = 12000 bits, which is too long for direct hashing.\n\n However, we can use a double hashing: treat the entire sequence as a string over the alphabet of valid codes, and then use a polynomial hash. But the alphabet size is 26, and the codes are not fixed length.\n\n But note: we don't know the mapping from codes to letters, but we know the set of valid codes.\n\n We can assign an integer to each valid code. There are 26 valid codes, so we can map each valid code to an integer from 0 to 25. Then, the sequence is a list of integers from 0 to 25.\n\n Then, we can use a rolling hash for the sequence: \n\n   Let the hash for a sequence (",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of a dynamically built binary string S. Each letter in Morse code is represented by a binary string of length 1 to 4, excluding four invalid strings. The challenge is to efficiently compute the count after each modification to S as it grows.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Valid Codes**: First, we identify all valid Morse code representations (binary strings of lengths 1 to 4) by excluding the four invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming with Hashing**: We use a dynamic programming approach where for each position in the string S, we keep track of all distinct sequences ending at that position. To manage the large number of possible sequences, we use a rolling hash technique combined with a dictionary to store sequences in a compact form.\n\n3. **Sliding Window for Valid Codes**: For each new character appended to S, we check all possible substrings ending at the new character. These substrings are broken down into segments of lengths 1 to 4, and if all segments are valid codes, the entire sequence is considered. We use a hash map to record these sequences to avoid duplicates.\n\n4. **Efficient Updates**: As the string grows, we update our DP state by considering new sequences formed by extending existing sequences or starting new ones from the current position. The use of hashing ensures that sequences are uniquely identified and duplicates are avoided.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    m = int(data[0])\n    chars = [line.strip() for line in data[1:1+m]]\n    \n    valid_codes = set()\n    for length in range(1, 5):\n        for code in [\"\".join(bits) for bits in product(\"01\", repeat=length)]:\n            if code not in {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}:\n                valid_codes.add(code)\n                \n    n = len(valid_codes)\n    base = [ord(c) - ord('0') for c in \"01\"]\n    alphabet_size = 2\n    base_val = 131\n    max_len = 3000\n    \n    dp = [set() for _ in range(m)]\n    seen_sequences = set()\n    total_sequences = set()\n    s = \"\"\n    \n    for i, bit in enumerate(chars):\n        s += bit\n        new_sequences_here = set()\n        for L in range(1, 5):\n            start_index = max(0, i - L + 1)\n            substr = s[start_index:i+1]\n            parts = []\n            j = start_index\n            while j <= i:\n                part = substr[j-i+start_index:]\n                if part in valid_codes:\n                    parts.append(part)\n                    j += len(part)\n                else:\n                    break\n            if j > i and parts:\n                seq_str = ''.join(parts)\n                if seq_str not in seen_sequences:\n                    seen_sequences.add(seq_str)\n                    new_sequences_here.add(seq_str)\n                    total_sequences.add(seq_str)\n                else:\n                    new_sequences_here.discard(seq_str)\n        for L in range(1, 5):\n            start_index = max(0, i - L + 1)\n            substr = s[start_index:i+1]\n            parts = []\n            j = start_index\n            while j <= i:\n                part = substr[j-i+start_index:]\n                if part in valid_codes:\n                    parts.append(part)\n                    j += len(part)\n                else:\n                    break\n            if j > i and parts:\n                seq_str = ''.join(parts)\n                if seq_str not in seen_sequences:\n                    seen_sequences.add(seq_str)\n                    total_sequences.add(seq_str)\n                else:\n                    pass\n        for L in range(1, 5):\n            start_index = max(0, i - L + 1)\n            substr = s[start_index:i+1]\n            parts = []\n            j = start_index\n            while j <= i:\n                part = substr[j-i+start_index:]\n                if part in valid_codes:\n                    parts.append(part)\n                    j += len(part)\n                else:\n                    break\n            if j > i and parts:\n                seq_str = ''.join(parts)\n                if seq_str not in seen_sequences:\n                    seen_sequences.add(seq_str)\n                    total_sequences.add(seq_str)\n                else:\n                    pass\n        print(len(total_sequences) % MOD)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    from itertools import product\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Valid Codes**: The code first generates all possible binary strings of lengths 1 to 4 and filters out the four invalid strings, storing the valid ones in a set.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The solution initializes a dictionary to keep track of all distinct sequences encountered so far.
