    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\nWe are given two integers a and b (with 1 <= a, b <= 10^9). We need to find a non-negative integer k such that:\n   LCM(a+k, b+k) is minimized.\n\nNote: If multiple k yield the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\nLet d = a - b. Without loss of generality, we can assume a >= b by swapping if needed. But note: the problem doesn't require that.\n\nActually, note that when k increases, both numbers increase. The LCM of two numbers x and y is (x * y) / GCD(x,y).\n\nBut note: \n   Let x = a+k, y = b+k.\nThen, x - y = a - b (constant).\n\nSo, we can write:\n   LCM(x, y) = (x * y) / GCD(x, y)\n\nBut note that GCD(x, y) must divide (x-y) = a-b (if a>=b then x-y = a-b, otherwise negative but we can take absolute value? Actually, GCD(x,y) divides any linear combination, so it divides (x-y)).\n\nAlternatively, we can set d = |a-b|. Then, for k, note that the GCD of (a+k, b+k) must divide d.\n\nTherefore, the GCD g must be a divisor of d.\n\nNow, consider: \n   x = a+k, y = b+k, then g = GCD(x,y) divides d = |a-b|.\n\nWe can write:\n   x = g * m, y = g * n, with GCD(m,n)=1, and then m-n = (a+k - (b+k))/g = (a-b)/g.\n\nBut note: without loss of generality, assume a>=b so d = a-b. Then we have:\n   x = g * m, y = g * n, and m-n = (a-b)/g = d/g.\n\nSince m and n are coprime, and m>n, then m and n are consecutive in the sense of coprimality? Actually, we have m = n + d/g.\n\nBut also, note that k = g*n - b = g*m - a (if we use the first equation). Since m = n + d/g, then k = g*(n + d/g) - a = g*n + d - a.\n\nBut note: d = a-b, so d = a-b, then k = g*n + (a-b) - a = g*n - b.\n\nAlternatively, we can express k in terms of divisors of d.\n\nHowever, note: k must be non-negative.\n\nHow to approach?\n\nIdea:\n   Let d = |a-b|. If d==0, then a==b. Then the problem becomes: LCM(a+k, a+k) = a+k, so we want to minimize a+k. The smallest k is 0.\n\n   Otherwise, d>0.\n\n   The key observation: the GCD of (a+k, b+k) must divide d. Therefore, we can iterate over all divisors g of d (both positive divisors). Then, for each divisor g, we can set:\n\n        Let t = d / g   [so t is an integer]\n\n        Then, we require that there exists an integer n such that:\n            a+k ≡ 0 (mod g)   and   b+k ≡ 0 (mod g)  -> which is equivalent to k ≡ (-a) mod g and k ≡ (-b) mod g.\n\n        But note: since a ≡ b + d (mod g) and d is divisible by g, then (-a) ≡ (-b - d) ≡ (-b) mod g because d is divisible by g.\n\n        So actually, we only require one congruence: k ≡ (-a) mod g, i.e., k ≡ (g - (a % g)) % g, but wait: we can also think of it as:\n\n        We want k such that (a+k) is divisible by g. Similarly, (b+k) is divisible by g. Since (a-b) is divisible by g, if one is divisible then the other is.\n\n        Now, we can set k_min for this g as: \n\n            Let r = a % g. Then we require k ≡ (-r) mod g. The smallest non-negative k for this g is: \n                k0 = (g - r) % g   [but if r==0 then k0=0]\n\n        However, note: we have two conditions: (a+k) divisible by g and (b+k) divisible by g. Since (a-b) is divisible by g, then if (a+k) is divisible by g, then (b+k) = (a+k) - (a-b) is divisible by g.\n\n        So we can set k0 = (g - (a % g)) % g.\n\n        But note: k0 might not be the only candidate? Actually, we can also consider that the condition is satisfied for k0, k0+g, k0+2g, etc.\n\n        However, note that the LCM for fixed g is determined by the representation:\n\n            (a+k) = g * m, (b+k) = g * n, with m-n = t (which is d/g) and GCD(m,n)=1.\n\n        Then, the LCM is (g*m * g*n) / GCD(m,n) = g^2 * m * n.\n\n        But note: m and n must be coprime. And m = (a+k)/g, n = (b+k)/g.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the LCM for k0 (the smallest non-negative k for this divisor g) and then compare.\n\n        However, note: k0 is the smallest non-negative k that satisfies the condition for divisor g. But we must consider that the same g might appear in multiple ways? Actually, no, for a fixed divisor g, we have a unique residue class modulo g.\n\n        But note: there is a catch. The condition for the GCD being exactly g? Or at least divisible by g? Actually, we are iterating over divisors of d, but note: the GCD could be any divisor of d, but we are considering each divisor g (that divides d). However, the actual GCD might be larger than g? \n\n        Let me clarify: We know that the GCD of (a+k, b+k) must divide d. But note: we are setting k such that g divides (a+k) and (b+k). However, the GCD might be a multiple of g? Actually, no: because the GCD must divide d, and we are taking g as a divisor of d. But if we set k so that g divides both, then the GCD is at least g. But we are not forcing the GCD to be exactly g. However, note that if we set k0 for divisor g, then the GCD might be greater than g (if the numbers share more common factors). But then, we would have already considered a divisor that is the GCD? Not necessarily.\n\n        Example: a=6, b=10, then d=4. Divisors: 1,2,4.\n\n        For g=1: k0 = (1 - (6%1)) % 1 -> 6%1 is 0, so k0=0. Then (6,10): GCD=2, which is greater than 1. But then why would we consider g=1? Because the condition is that the GCD divides 4, so 1 is a divisor and we consider k0=0. However, the LCM for k=0 is 30. Then we consider g=2: k0 = (2- (6%2))%2 = (2-0)%2=0. Then (6,10): GCD=2, LCM= (6*10)/2 = 30. Then g=4: k0 = (4- (6%4))%4 = (4-2)%4=2. Then (8,12): GCD=4, LCM=(8*12)/4=24.\n\n        So we found k=2 gives a smaller LCM.\n\n        But note: the condition for g=2: we set k0=0, and that gives the same LCM as g=1. But we are allowed to consider any divisor g. However, the LCM computed for k0=0 (for g=2) is 30, and for g=4 is 24.\n\n        So we cannot ignore divisors that are not the GCD. But note: the GCD of the two numbers must be a divisor of d. So we are covering all possibilities by iterating over divisors.\n\n        However, note: the same k might be generated by multiple divisors. For example, k=0 is generated by g=1 and g=2. But we don't care, because we are going to compute the LCM for each candidate k and then choose the minimal LCM and then the smallest k.\n\n        But wait: the problem says: if there are multiple k giving the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k. So we have to consider all k that give the minimal LCM.\n\n        How do we do that?\n\n        Steps:\n\n        1. If a == b, then answer is 0.\n\n        2. Let d = abs(a-b). Then factorize d and get all divisors.\n\n        3. For each divisor g of d (including 1 and d), we compute:\n\n            k0 = (g - (a % g)) % g   [this gives the smallest non-negative k such that (a+k) % g == 0]\n\n        4. Then, for each such k0 (and note: k0 is non-negative) we compute:\n\n            x = a + k0, y = b + k0\n            g0 = gcd(x, y)   [Note: g0 might be greater than g? Actually, we are forcing that g divides both, but the GCD might be a multiple of g? However, note: we are iterating over divisors of d, and the GCD must divide d. But the GCD we get from the two numbers might not be g, but it will be a divisor of d and hence we are covering all possibilities by considering every divisor? Actually, no: because we are generating k0 for each divisor g, and then we are computing the LCM. The LCM depends on the actual GCD of the two numbers, not just g.\n\n        However, note: the LCM formula: LCM(x,y) = (x*y) // gcd(x,y). So even if we fix g (as a divisor of d) and set k0, the actual GCD might be different. But note: the GCD must divide d, and we are iterating over every divisor. However, the same k0 might be produced by multiple divisors. \n\n        Alternative approach: we know that the GCD of (a+k, b+k) must divide d. Therefore, the GCD is one of the divisors of d. Then, we can iterate over all divisors g of d, and for each divisor g, we can set k to be the smallest non-negative integer such that g divides (a+k) (and hence (b+k)), and then compute the LCM for that k. Then, we compare these LCMs.\n\n        But note: there might be a k that is not generated by any divisor g (because the GCD of the two numbers might be a divisor of d, but we are generating k0 for each divisor g). However, the condition is that the GCD must divide d, so the k we generate by the divisors of d cover all possibilities.\n\n        Why? Because for any k, the GCD(g0) of (a+k, b+k) divides d. Then, we are considering g0 (which divides d) and we would have generated k0 for g0 (unless k0 is smaller than the k we are using). Actually, no: we are generating the minimal k for each divisor g. But note: if we have two divisors g1 and g2 (both dividing d) and we set k1 for g1 and k2 for g2, then it is possible that one k is smaller than the other.\n\n        However, we must consider that the same k might be generated by multiple divisors. Also, note that k0 for a divisor g is the smallest k that makes g divide (a+k). But what if we want to consider a divisor that is not the GCD? Then the k we get might be too small and the actual GCD might be larger. But that's okay because we are going to compute the LCM for that k and then compare.\n\n        But note: the same k might be generated by multiple divisors. For example, k=0: then (a+k) and (b+k) are a and b. Then the GCD is g0 (which divides d). Then k=0 is generated by every divisor g that divides g0 (since if g divides g0 and g0 divides d, then g divides d, and then k=0 satisfies (a+k)%g==0 if g divides a and b). However, we are generating k0 for each divisor g. \n\n        How to avoid duplicates? We don't need to avoid duplicates because we are going to compare LCMs and then choose the minimal k.\n\n        However, the number of divisors of d is O(sqrt(d)), which is acceptable for d up to 10^9 (since 10^9 has about 1344 divisors in the worst-case). But note: a and b can be up to 10^9, so d can be up to 10^9.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        - Read a, b.\n        - If a == b: print 0 and exit.\n        - Let d = abs(a-b)\n        - Factorize d? Or iterate i from 1 to sqrt(d) to get divisors.\n\n        Then, for each divisor g of d (positive divisors only):\n\n            k0 = (g - (a % g)) % g\n\n            Then, set x = a + k0, y = b + k0.\n\n            Then, compute g0 = gcd(x, y)   [This is the actual GCD of the two numbers]\n\n            Then, lcm_val = (x * y) // g0\n\n            Then, we record (k0, lcm_val)\n\n        Then, we also have to consider that k0 must be non-negative (it is by construction).\n\n        But note: There is another possibility: what if we consider k beyond k0 for a divisor g? For example, k0 + t*g (t>=1) might lead to the same or better LCM? \n\n        Actually, note: the LCM is determined by the two numbers and their GCD. Increasing k by multiples of g will change the numbers, and the GCD might change. However, note that the GCD must divide d, so we are covering all divisors. But we are only considering the minimal k for each divisor g.\n\n        Why minimal k? Because if we take a larger k (like k0 + g) then the two numbers become larger and the product (and hence the LCM) is likely to be larger. However, is it possible that a larger k (from the same divisor g) leads to a smaller LCM? \n\n        Example: Consider a=2, b=4, then d=2. Divisors: [1,2].\n\n        For g=1: k0 = (1 - (2%1)) % 1 -> 2%1 is 0, so k0=0. Then numbers (2,4): GCD=2, LCM=4.\n        For g=2: k0 = (2 - (2%2)) % 2 = (2-0)%2=0. Same k0=0.\n\n        Now, consider k0+g=2 (for divisor 2): \n            Then numbers (4,6): GCD=2, LCM=12.\n\n        So worse.\n\n        But consider another example: a=5, b=10, d=5. Divisors: [1,5].\n\n        g=1: k0 = (1 - (5%1))%1 = 0 -> numbers (5,10): GCD=5, LCM=10.\n        g=5: k0 = (5 - (5%5))%5 = 0 -> same.\n\n        Now, consider k=5 (for divisor 5): numbers (10,15): GCD=5, LCM=30.\n\n        So again, worse.\n\n        However, wait: what if we consider divisors that are not the GCD? Actually, we are forced to consider divisors of d, and the minimal k for each divisor is the smallest k that makes the numbers divisible by that divisor.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"the least common multiple of a+k and b+k is the smallest possible\". We are generating candidate k's by divisors of d. Is it possible that a k that is not the minimal one for any divisor leads to a smaller LCM?\n\n        Let me think: the LCM is determined by the two numbers and their GCD. The GCD must divide d. So the GCD is one of the divisors. And the minimal k for a divisor g (which is the GCD) might not be the same as the minimal k for a divisor that is a multiple of g (if we consider a divisor that is the GCD, then we are getting the minimal k for that divisor). \n\n        However, note: if we have two divisors g1 and g2 (with g1 < g2) and g1 divides g2, then the minimal k for g2 might be less than the minimal k for g1? Actually, no: the minimal k for g2 must be a multiple of g2? Not necessarily.\n\n        Example: a=10, b=15, d=5. Divisors: 1,5.\n\n        For g=1: k0 = (1 - (10%1))%1 = 0 -> (10,15): GCD=5, LCM=30.\n        For g=5: k0 = (5 - (10%5))%5 = 0 -> same.\n\n        Now, consider k=5 (for divisor 5): (15,20): GCD=5, LCM=60.\n\n        But what if we consider a divisor that is not the GCD? Actually, we are only considering divisors of d. The GCD is 5, which is one of them.\n\n        But wait: is it possible that the minimal k for a divisor g (which is not the GCD) gives a LCM that is lower than the minimal k for the GCD? \n\n        Example: a=4, b=6, d=2. Divisors: 1,2.\n\n        For g=1: k0=0 -> (4,6): GCD=2, LCM=12.\n        For g=2: k0= (2 - (4%2))%2 = (2-0)%2=0 -> same.\n\n        Now, consider k=2 (for divisor 2): (6,8): GCD=2, LCM=24.\n\n        But wait, what if we try a divisor that is not 1 or 2? There are none.\n\n        However, note: the GCD of (4+k,6+k) must divide 2, so divisors are 1 and 2. So we covered.\n\n        But note: what if we consider a divisor that is not the GCD but a divisor of d? Then we are still covering because the LCM calculation will use the actual GCD (which is the GCD of the two numbers). \n\n        However, there is a catch: the minimal k for a divisor g (say g=1) is 0, but the actual GCD of (a+0, b+0) is 2, which is a divisor of d. Then, we also considered g=2 and got the same k0=0. So we are not missing any k0.\n\n        But note: we must consider that k0 for a divisor g is the smallest k that makes the numbers divisible by g. However, the same k might be the minimal for several divisors. \n\n        Therefore, the plan is:\n\n        Step 1: If a == b, output 0.\n        Step 2: d = abs(a-b)\n        Step 3: Find all divisors of d.\n        Step 4: Initialize best_lcm = None, best_k = None.\n        Step 5: For each divisor g in divisors:\n            k0 = (g - a % g) % g\n            x = a + k0\n            y = b + k0\n            g0 = gcd(x, y)   [This is the GCD of the two numbers]\n            lcm_val = (x * y) // g0\n\n            Compare lcm_val with best_lcm:\n                If best_lcm is None, then set best_lcm = lcm_val, best_k = k0.\n                Else if lcm_val < best_lcm, then update best_lcm and best_k = k0.\n                Else if lcm_val == best_lcm and k0 < best_k, then update best_k = k0.\n\n        Step 6: Print best_k.\n\n        But wait: is that correct? Consider that k0 might be very large? Actually, the divisors g are divisors of d (which is at most 10^9). The k0 for a divisor g is in the range [0, g-1]. Since g is at most d (which is 10^9), then k0 can be up to 10^9, but note: we are iterating over divisors, and the number of divisors is O(sqrt(d)) which is acceptable for d up to 10^9.\n\n        However, note: we must compute the GCD for numbers that can be as large as 10^9 + 10^9 = 2e9. The Euclidean algorithm for numbers up to 2e9 is efficient (logarithmic steps).\n\n        But wait: is it possible that the same k0 appears multiple times? Then we are storing the same k0 multiple times, but we are comparing the LCM and then the k0. Since k0 is the same, then if the LCM is the same we don't change the k0 (we only update if k0 is smaller). But if the same k0 gives the same LCM, then we don't need to worry.\n\n        However, there is an issue: we are generating k0 for divisors. But note: the minimal k for a divisor g is the smallest non-negative k such that g divides (a+k). However, it is possible that a divisor g1 and g2 (both divisors of d) lead to the same k0? Then we are computing the same (x,y) and same LCM twice. But that's acceptable.\n\n        But note: we must consider that there might be a k that is not generated by any divisor? \n\n        Actually, the condition for the GCD is that it divides d. Therefore, for any k, the GCD g0 divides d, so g0 is one of the divisors we are iterating. Then, the minimal k for divisor g0 is the smallest k such that g0 divides (a+k). But note: the k we are generating for g0 is the minimal k that satisfies that condition. However, we are also generating k for divisors that are multiples of g0 (if they exist). \n\n        But note: the minimal k for a divisor g (which is a divisor of d) is independent of the GCD. \n\n        However, there is a catch: the minimal k for a divisor g might be 0, but then the actual GCD of the two numbers (at k=0) might be greater than g. Then, we are effectively considering a divisor that is the actual GCD (which is a divisor of d) and we are also generating k0=0 for the divisor g (which is the actual GCD). So we are covering.\n\n        But wait: what if the minimal k for divisor g is k0, but then the actual GCD is a divisor of d that is greater than g? Then we are also going to consider that divisor (the actual GCD) and its minimal k (which might be k0 or even smaller). \n\n        Example: a=5, b=10, d=5. Divisors: 1,5.\n\n        For g=1: k0=0 -> (5,10): GCD=5, which is a divisor of d. Then we will also consider g=5: k0= (5- (5%5))%5 =0. So same k0.\n\n        Now, consider a=5, b=15, d=10. Divisors: 1,2,5,10.\n\n        For g=1: k0=0 -> (5,15): GCD=5, LCM=15.\n        For g=2: k0 = (2- (5%2))%2 = (2-1)%2=1 -> (6,16): GCD=2, LCM=48.\n        For g=5: k0=0 -> same as g=1.\n        For g=10: k0 = (10- (5%10))%10 = (10-5)%10=5 -> (10,20): GCD=10, LCM=20.\n\n        So the minimal LCM is 15 (at k0=0) and 20 (at k0=5). So we choose k0=0.\n\n        But wait: is k0=0 the minimal k for divisor 5? Yes. But note: the divisor 5 is the GCD at k0=0. \n\n        However, what if we consider k0=4 for divisor 10? We don't because we only consider the minimal k for divisor 10 (which is 5). \n\n        But note: we are only considering the minimal k for each divisor. But the problem: the minimal k overall might come from a non-minimal k for a divisor? \n\n        Example: Let me try to construct one.\n\n        Suppose we have two divisors: g1 and g2, and the minimal k for g1 is k1, and for g2 is k2. But suppose there is a k that is not k1 or k2, but leads to a divisor g3 (which we are considering) and the LCM is lower.\n\n        Actually, note: the condition for k is that the GCD must divide d, so the minimal k for a divisor g is the smallest k that makes the GCD at least g (actually, divisible by g). But the LCM is (x*y)//g0, and g0 is the GCD (which is at least g). \n\n        However, note: the LCM might be minimized by a k that does not make the GCD as large as possible. \n\n        Example: a=3, b=5, d=2. Divisors: [1,2].\n\n        For g=1: k0=0 -> (3,5): GCD=1, LCM=15.\n        For g=2: k0= (2- (3%2))%2 = (2-1)%2=1 -> (4,6): GCD=2, LCM=12.\n\n        Now, consider k=3 (not minimal for divisor 1 or 2): \n            (6,8): GCD=2, LCM=24.\n\n        k=2: (5,7): GCD=1, LCM=35.\n\n        k=4: (7,9): GCD=1, LCM=63.\n\n        k=5: (8,10): GCD=2, LCM=40.\n\n        So the minimal LCM is 12 at k=1.\n\n        But note: we did not consider k=0 and k=1 and k=2,... but we only considered k0=0 and k0=1. \n\n        However, what if we consider a divisor that is not the GCD? Then we are forced to consider the minimal k for that divisor. But note: the GCD must divide d, so the divisors we consider are the divisors of d (which is 2). \n\n        Now, consider a different example: a=8, b=12, d=4. Divisors: 1,2,4.\n\n        k0 for g=1: 0 -> (8,12): GCD=4, LCM=24.\n        k0 for g=2: (2-8%2)%2=0 -> same k0=0: (8,12): GCD=4, LCM=24.\n        k0 for g=4: (4-8%4)%4=0 -> same.\n\n        But wait, is there a k that gives a lower LCM? \n\n        k=0: LCM=24.\n        k=1: (9,13): GCD=1, LCM=117.\n        k=2: (10,14): GCD=2, LCM=70.\n        k=3: (11,15): GCD=1, LCM=165.\n        k=4: (12,16): GCD=4, LCM=48.\n        k=5: (13,17): GCD=1, LCM=221.\n        k=6: (14,18): GCD=2, LCM=126.\n        k=7: (15,19): GCD=1, LCM=285.\n        k=8: (16,20): GCD=4, LCM=80.\n\n        So the minimal is k=0 with LCM=24, then k=4 with LCM=48, etc.\n\n        But wait: what if we consider divisor 4 and k0=0, then we get 24. But note: the minimal k for divisor 4 is 0, but what if we consider k=4 (which is 0 mod 4)? Then we are effectively considering the same divisor 4, but we are not because we only consider the minimal k. However, note: the minimal k for divisor 4 is 0, but then the next k is 4, 8, etc. And we are not iterating over these.\n\n        This is a problem: our method only considers the minimal k for each divisor. But sometimes, a non-minimal k (i.e., k0 + t*g for t>=1) might yield a smaller LCM.\n\n        Example: a=8, b=12, d=4. The minimal k for divisor 4 is 0, and we computed LCM=24. But what if we take k=4 (which is 0 mod 4) and then the numbers (12,16): GCD=4, LCM=48, which is worse.\n\n        However, consider a=9, b=15, d=6. Divisors: 1,2,3,6.\n\n        For g=1: k0=0 -> (9,15): GCD=3, LCM=45.\n        For g=2: k0= (2-9%2)%2= (2-1)%2=1 -> (10,16): GCD=2, LCM=80.\n        For g=3: k0= (3-9%3)%3=0 -> same as g=1: (9,15): LCM=45.\n        For g=6: k0= (6-9%6)%6= (6-3)%6=3 -> (12,18): GCD=6, LCM=36.\n\n        Now, the minimal LCM is 36 at k=3.\n\n        But wait, is there a k between 0 and 3 that we missed? \n        k=0: LCM=45\n        k=1: (10,16): GCD=2, LCM=80\n        k=2: (11,17): GCD=1, LCM=187\n        k=3: 36\n\n        So k=3 is the minimal.\n\n        But note: we only considered k0=0,1,0,3. We didn't consider k0=2 (which is not the minimal k for any divisor). However, the LCM at k=2 is worse.\n\n        But what if there is a divisor that requires k0=2? \n\n        The divisors are 1,2,3,6. For divisor 2: k0=1; for divisor 3: k0=0; for divisor 6: k0=3; for divisor 1: k0=0. So no divisor requires k0=2.\n\n        Now, consider a case where a non-minimal k for a divisor gives a better LCM.\n\n        Example: a=4, b=6, d=2. Divisors: 1,2.\n\n        k0 for g=1:0 -> (4,6): GCD=2, LCM=12.\n        k0 for g=2:0 -> same.\n\n        Now, consider k=2: (6,8): GCD=2, LCM=24 -> worse.\n\n        Example: a=3, b=5, d=2. We saw k=1 was best.\n\n        Example: a=2, b=4, d=2. Divisors:1,2.\n\n        k0 for g=1:0 -> (2,4): GCD=2, LCM=4.\n        k0 for g=2:0 -> same.\n\n        Now, k=2: (4,6): GCD=2, LCM=12.\n\n        Example: a=7, b=3, d=4. Divisors:1,2,4.\n\n        k0 for g=1:0 -> (7,3): GCD=1, LCM=21.\n        k0 for g=2: (2-7%2)%2= (2-1)%2=1 -> (8,4): GCD=4, LCM=8.\n        k0 for g=4: (4-7%4)%4= (4-3)%4=1 -> same as above.\n\n        But wait, k0 for g=2 and g=4 are both 1. Then we compute (8,4): GCD=4, LCM=8.\n\n        Now, is there a k=0,1,2,...,6?\n        k=0: LCM=21\n        k=1: LCM=8\n        k=2: (9,5): GCD=1, LCM=45\n        k=3: (10,6): GCD=2, LCM=30\n        k=4: (11,7): GCD=1, LCM=77\n        k=5: (12,8): GCD=4, LCM=24\n        k=6: (13,9): GCD=1, LCM=117\n\n        So k=1 is the best.\n\n        Now, what if we have a divisor g and we consider k0 + t*g (t>=1) and it yields a smaller LCM?\n\n        Example: a=10, b=14, d=4. Divisors:1,2,4.\n\n        k0 for g=1:0 -> (10,14): GCD=2, LCM=70.\n        k0 for g=2:0 -> same.\n        k0 for g=4: (4-10%4)%4= (4-2)%4=2 -> (12,16): GCD=4, LCM=48.\n\n        Now, consider k=2 (minimal for divisor 4) -> LCM=48, which is less than 70.\n\n        But wait, is there a k that is not the minimal for any divisor that yields a lower LCM?\n\n        k=0: LCM=70\n        k=1: (11,15): GCD=1, LCM=165\n        k=2: LCM=48\n        k=3: (13,17): GCD=1, LCM=221\n        k=4: (14,18): GCD=2, LCM=126\n        k=5: (15,19): GCD=1, LCM=285\n        k=6: (16,20): GCD=4, LCM=80\n\n        So k=2 is best.\n\n        Now, consider a=11, b=17, d=6. Divisors:1,2,3,6.\n\n        k0 for g=1:0 -> (11,17): GCD=1, LCM=187.\n        g=2: (2-11%2)%2= (2-1)%2=1 -> (12,18): GCD=6, L",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find a non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If multiple values of \\( k \\) yield the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the GCD of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) must divide the difference \\( d = |a - b| \\). This means we can iterate over all divisors of \\( d \\) to find potential values of \\( k \\) that could minimize the LCM.\n2. **Intuition**: For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( d \\), compute the smallest non-negative \\( k \\) such that both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) are divisible by \\( g \\). This \\( k \\) ensures that the GCD of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is at least \\( g \\), which helps in reducing the LCM.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - If \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are equal, the answer is \\( 0 \\) since the LCM of any number with itself is the number itself.\n   - Otherwise, compute all divisors of \\( d = |a - b| \\).\n   - For each divisor \\( g \\), compute \\( k \\) as the smallest non-negative integer such that \\( (a + k) \\% g == 0 \\).\n   - For each computed \\( k \\), calculate the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\).\n   - Track the \\( k \\) that results in the smallest LCM. If multiple \\( k \\) values yield the same LCM, choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves finding all divisors of \\( d \\), which takes \\( O(\\sqrt{d}) \\) time. For each divisor, computing the GCD and LCM using Euclidean algorithm operations is efficient, leading to an overall complexity that is manageable even for large \\( d \\) (up to \\( 10^9 \\)).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nfrom math import gcd\n\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    d = abs(a - b)\n    divisors = set()\n    i = 1\n    while i * i <= d:\n        if d % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(d // i)\n        i += 1\n        \n    best_k = None\n    best_lcm = None\n    \n    for g in divisors:\n        remainder = a % g\n        if remainder == 0:\n            k0 = 0\n        else:\n            k0 = g - remainder\n            \n        x = a + k0\n        y = b + k0\n        current_gcd = gcd(x, y)\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n        \n        if best_lcm is None:\n            best_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k0\n        else:\n            if current_lcm < best_lcm:\n                best_lcm = current_lcm\n                best_k = k0\n            elif current_lcm == best_lcm and k0 < best_k:\n                best_k = k0\n                \n    print(best_k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) from standard input.\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are equal, it immediately outputs \\( 0 \\) since the LCM of a number with itself is minimized at \\( k = 0 \\).\n3. **Divisor Calculation**: The code calculates all divisors of \\( d = |a - b| \\) by iterating up to the square root of \\( d \\).\n4. **Finding Optimal \\( k \\)**: For each divisor \\( g \\), it computes the smallest \\( k \\) such that \\( a + k \\) is divisible by \\( g \\). This \\( k \\) is derived using modulo arithmetic.\n5. **LCM Calculation**: For each computed \\( k \\), the code calculates the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) using their GCD.\n6. **Tracking Best \\( k \\)**: The code keeps track of the \\( k \\) that results in the smallest LCM.
