The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given n (number of rounds), string A (Nikephoros's sequence) and string B (Polycarpus's sequence)\n Since n can be up to 2e9, we cannot simulate round by round.\n Instead, we can use the concept of cycles.\n\n Let m = len(A), k = len(B). The sequences repeat every m and k rounds respectively.\n\n In one full cycle of both sequences (i.e., LCM(m, k) rounds?), we can compute the outcomes for each round in the cycle.\n However, note: the two sequences cycle independently. So, we can consider the rounds as being indexed from 0 to n-1.\n\n For round i (0-indexed), \n   Nikephoros plays A[i % m]\n   Polycarpus plays B[i % k]\n\n We can break the n rounds into complete cycles of length L = LCM(m, k) and then a remainder.\n\n But note: the LCM might be too large? Actually, m, k <= 1000, so LCM(m,k) <= 1000*1000 (worst-case) but actually LCM(m,k) is at most m*k which is 1e6, and then we have to simulate L rounds? That would be acceptable because 1e6 is acceptable for a loop if we do it only once.\n\n However, note: n can be 2e9, and the LCM could be up to 1e6. Then we can simulate one cycle (of length L) and then multiply by the number of full cycles and then simulate the remaining rounds.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Precompute the total rounds in one full cycle (LCM(m, k)): \n      L = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n\n 2. But note: the game has two independent cycles. We can think of the round i as (i % m, i % k). The state (i % m, i % k) repeats every LCM(m,k).\n\n 3. We can precompute an array `cycle` of length L (which is the LCM) that contains the outcome (who wins) for each round in the cycle.\n\n However, note that we don't need to store all the outcomes, but we need to count the number of losses for each player.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute the entire cycle's loss counts for one cycle and then use multiplication.\n\n But note: we cannot store an array of length 1e6 and then multiply by the number of cycles (which could be up to 2e9 / 1e6 ~ 2000 cycles) because 1e6 * 2000 is 2e9, which is acceptable in terms of storing an integer for each cycle, but wait: we are going to break the problem into:\n\n Let L = LCM(m, k)\n Let cycles_count = n // L\n Let remainder = n % L\n\n Then the total losses for Nikephoros would be: cycles_count * (losses in one cycle for Nikephoros) + (losses in the first 'remainder' rounds for Nikephoros)\n\n Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\n But wait: how to compute the losses in one cycle?\n\n We can simulate the entire cycle (L rounds) and count:\n   losses_N = 0\n   losses_P = 0\n\n However, note: L can be up to 1e6 (if m=1000, k=1000, then LCM(1000,1000)=1000, but worst-case for distinct coprime numbers, e.g., m=997, k=991, then LCM ~ 986067, which is acceptable).\n\n But note: worst-case m and k up to 1000, the LCM is at most 1000*1000 = 1000000 (if they are coprime, then LCM = m*k). So maximum 10^6 rounds per cycle.\n\n Then we do:\n\n   total_rounds = n\n   L = lcm(m, k)\n   cycles = n // L\n   rem = n % L\n\n   Precompute for one cycle (length L):\n        losses_N_cycle = 0\n        losses_P_cycle = 0\n        for i in range(L):\n            a = A[i % m]\n            b = B[i % k]\n            # Determine the outcome of the round\n            if a == b:\n                continue   # draw, no loss\n            else:\n                # Check who wins\n                # Rock beats Scissors: R vs S -> R wins, so S loses (so Polycarpus loses if he played S and Nikephoros played R)\n                # Scissors beats Paper:",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The players follow cyclic sequences for their moves, and simulating each round individually is infeasible for large `n` (up to 2·10^9). Instead, we leverage the periodicity of the sequences to compute the results efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who use repeating sequences of \"R\", \"S\", or \"P\". Each round's outcome depends on the current move from each player's sequence. The challenge is to count the number of losses (red spots) for each player over `n` rounds without processing each round individually.\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences repeat every `m` and `k` rounds for Nikephoros and Polycarpus, respectively. The combined cycle length is the least common multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k`. Within one LCM cycle, the outcomes repeat periodically.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Compute the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences.\n   - For each round in one LCM cycle, determine the winner (if any) and count the losses.\n   - Multiply the cycle's loss counts by the number of full cycles in `n` rounds.\n   - Process the remaining rounds after the full cycles.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes up to `m * k` rounds once (for the LCM cycle) and then handles the remainder in O(remainder) time. Given that `m` and `k` are up to 1000, the maximum LCM is 1,000,000, which is manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A = data[1].strip()\n    B = data[2].strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    L = m * k // math.gcd(m, k)\n    \n    losses_N_cycle = 0\n    losses_P_cycle = 0\n    \n    for i in range(L):\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n        elif (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'S') or \\\n             (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'P') or \\\n             (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'R'):\n            losses_P_cycle += 1\n        else:\n            losses_N_cycle += 1\n            \n    cycles_count = n // L\n    remainder = n % L\n    \n    total_loss_N = cycles_count * losses_N_cycle\n    total_loss_P = cycles_count * losses_P_cycle\n    \n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n        elif (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'S') or \\\n             (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'P') or \\\n             (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'R'):\n            total_loss_P += 1\n        else:\n            total_loss_N += 1\n            \n    print(f\"{total_loss_N} {total_loss_P}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by the sequences `A` (Nikephoros) and `B` (Polycarpus).\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of `A` and `B` determines the cycle length. This helps in identifying repeating patterns of outcomes.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: For each round in the LCM cycle, the code checks the outcome of the round (win, loss, or draw) based on the current move from each player's sequence.\n4. **Loss Counting**: The losses for each player in one full cycle are counted. These counts are multiplied by the number of full cycles in `n` rounds.\n5. **Remaining Rounds**: The remaining rounds after the full cycles are processed similarly to update the loss counts.\n6. **Output**: The total losses for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large values of `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
