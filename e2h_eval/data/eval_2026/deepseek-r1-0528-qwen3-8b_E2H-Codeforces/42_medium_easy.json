Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов. В самом начале копирования оба прогресс-бара показывают $$$0$$$ процентов.Найдите все такие целые числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно, что существует момент времени, в который оба прогресс-бара одновременно показывают это число. Выведите эти числа в порядке возрастания.\n\n## Input\nВ первой строке задано одно целое число $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — число копируемых файлов.Во второй строке заданы $$$n$$$ целых чисел $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$$$) — размеры файлов в байтах в том порядке, в котором они будут копироваться.\n\n## Output\nВыведите в возрастающем порядке все числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно такие, что существует момент времени, в который на обоих прогресс-барах одновременно показывается это число.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\n### Output\n['0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100', '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100', '0\\n50\\n99\\n100', '0\\n17\\n43\\n44\\n84\\n90\\n99\\n100']\n\n## Note\nВ первом тесте копируется всего один файл, поэтому оба прогресс-бара всегда показывают одинаковые значения.Во втором тесте первый прогресс-бар сразу же уйдёт вперёд, потом сбросится в ноль и начнёт догонять второй прогресс-бар заново. В конце копирования прогресс-бары некоторое время будут показывать одно и то же число.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given n and a list of n integers (file sizes)\n We need to find all integers from 0 to 100 (inclusive) such that there exists a moment when:\n   - The first progress bar (current file) shows p% (i.e., floor(100*x / a_i) = p) \n   - The second progress bar (total so far) shows p%\n\n How the process works:\n   We have files a1, a2, ..., an.\n\n   For the current file i, we are at byte x (0 <= x <= a_i). Then:\n     p1 = floor(100 * x / a_i)   [if we are in the middle of file i]\n     p2 = floor(100 * (sum_{j=1}^{i-1} a_j + x) / total_sum)\n\n   However, note that the same p must appear at the same time.\n\n   But note: the entire process goes through each file one by one. So we can simulate by iterating over files and then over bytes.\n\n   However, note that n is at most 100 and each a_i is at most 1000, so the total sum is at most 100*1000 = 100000.\n\n   But if we try to iterate over each byte (which could be up to 1000 per file) then worst-case 100*1000 = 100000 steps, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, we cannot iterate over each byte for each file because the total sum might be large (but note: the total number of bytes is fixed, but we are iterating by file and then by the bytes in that file).\n\n   But note: the problem says that after copying each byte we update. So we can simulate the entire process by:\n\n   total = sum(a)\n   Let prefix_sum[i] = a1+a2+...+ai\n\n   Then, when we are in file i (0-indexed) at byte x (from 0 to a_i), then:\n      current_file_progress = floor(100 * x / a_i)   [Note: if x==0 then 0%, but also note that at the very beginning of the file (x=0) we haven't started copying any byte, but the problem says after copying each byte. So we consider x from 0 to a_i? Actually, the problem says \"after copying each byte\", so the moment when we just started (x=0) is included, and then we copy the first byte, then second, etc.\n\n   However, note that the problem says: \"after copying each byte\", so we consider x from 0 to a_i (including 0 and a_i). But wait, at the moment of having copied x bytes of file i, the first progress bar is floor(100*x/a_i). \n\n   Similarly, the total progress is floor(100*(prefix_sum[i-1] + x)/total) if i>=1, and for i=0, prefix_sum[-1]=0.\n\n   But note: the problem says the second progress bar includes the current file's x bytes.\n\n   We are to collect all p in [0,100] for which there exists an index i (file) and an integer x in [0, a_i] such that:\n        floor(100*x / a_i) = p   and   floor(100*(prefix_sum[i] + x?) Wait, no: the total so far is (sum of all previous files) + x, but note: when we are in file i, the previous files are a0 to a_{i-1}, so total_prev = prefix_sum[i-1] (if i>=1, else 0). Then the total so far is total_prev + x.\n\n   However, note that the entire set of files is being copied, so the total is fixed (total = prefix_sum[n-1]). But the second progress bar uses the total of all n files.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   We'll do:\n\n      total = sum(a)\n      prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n      for i in range(1, n+1):\n          prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n      Then, for each file i (from 0 to n-1):\n          Let current_file_size = a[i]\n          Let prev_total = prefix[i] - a[i]   # This is the sum of all files before this one? Actually, prefix[i] is the sum of first i files (from 0 to i-1). Then the total so far including the current file's x bytes is (prefix[i] + x) but wait, our prefix array: \n          Actually, let's redefine: \n            prefix[0] = 0\n            prefix[1] = a0\n            prefix[2] = a0+a1\n            ...\n          Then, when processing file i (0-indexed), the previous total is prefix[i] (which is the sum of the first i files, i.e., from 0 to i-1). Then the total so far is prefix[i] + x.\n\n      Conditions for a given i and x (0<=x<=a[i]):\n\n          p1 = floor(100 * x / current_file_size)   [This must be an integer between 0 and 100, but note: if x=0 then 0, and if x=current_file_size then floor(100 * current_file_size / current_file_size)=100]\n\n          p2 = floor(100 * (prefix[i] + x) / total)\n\n          And we require p1 == p2.\n\n      But note: the problem says that the same p must appear at the same time. So for a fixed p, we need to check if there exists an i and an x (with 0<=x<=a[i]) such that:\n          floor(100*x / a[i]) = p   and   floor(100*(prefix[i] + x)/total) = p.\n\n      However, note that the same p might be achieved multiple times, but we only need to know if it appears at least once.\n\n   But note: we are to output all p from 0 to 100 that satisfy the condition.\n\n   However, there is a catch: the entire process is sequential. The progress bars update after each byte. But note that the same p might be achieved in different files, but that's okay because we only care about existence.\n\n   But wait: is it possible that the same p is achieved in two different ways? Yes, but we only need to mark p as present.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the condition for a given p must hold at the same moment (same x and same file). But note: the two conditions are for the same moment (same x and same file i). \n\n   But note: the second progress bar uses the entire total (all n files) and the first progress bar only the current file.\n\n   How to check for a fixed p and a fixed file i?\n\n      We require:\n          p <= 100*x/a_i < p+1   =>   x >= ceil(p * a_i / 100) and x < (p+1)*a_i/100   [Actually, note: floor(100*x/a_i)=p means p <= 100*x/a_i < p+1, so x must be in [ceil(p * a_i / 100), floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9)]? But note: integer division and floor.\n\n      Actually, we can write:\n\n          x_min1 = ceil(p * a_i / 100)\n          x_max1 = floor((p+1) * a_i / 100 - 1e-9)   [But wait: floor(100*x/a_i)=p  <=>  p <= 100*x/a_i < p+1  <=>  (p * a_i)/100 <= x < ((p+1)*a_i)/100 ]\n\n      However, x must be an integer. So:\n\n          x_min1 = max(0, floor((p * a_i + 99) / 100))   ? Not exactly.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          Condition: floor(100*x/a_i) = p   <=>   x in [ceil(p * a_i / 100), floor(((p+1)*a_i - 1)/100)]\n\n      But note: floor(100*x/a_i) = p   <=>   x_min = ceil((p * a_i) / 100)   and   x_max = floor(((p+1) * a_i - 1) / 100)   OR maybe not.\n\n      Actually, we can solve for x:\n\n          p <= 100*x/a_i < p+1\n          => (p * a_i) / 100 <= x < (p+1)*a_i/100\n\n      Since x is an integer, then x must be in the interval [ceil((p * a_i)/100), floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9)] but note: if (p+1)*a_i is divisible by 100, then the upper bound is exclusive.\n\n      But we can use:\n\n          low_bound = (p * a_i + 99) // 100   [because ceil(a/b) = (a+b-1)//b, but here we want ceil(p*a_i/100). However, note: ceil(x) = (x + 1 - epsilon) converted to int?]\n\n      Alternatively, we can iterate over x from 0 to a_i and check the condition? But the maximum a_i is 1000, and n is 100, so we would do 100 * 1000 * 100 (for each p from 0 to 100) -> 100 * 1000 * 101 = 10,100,000 which is acceptable in Python? Actually, we don't need to iterate over p from 0 to 100 separately.\n\n   Let me change perspective: Instead, we can iterate over each file and each byte, compute the two percentages, and record the p (if they are equal) and mark that p as occurring.\n\n   Steps:\n\n      total = sum(a)\n      prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n      for i in range(1, n+1):\n          prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n      Let seen = set()   # to collect the p values that occur at least once.\n\n      For i in range(n):   # current file index i (0-indexed)\n          size = a[i]\n          prev_total = prefix[i]   # total bytes from files 0 to i-1\n          for x in range(0, size+1):   # x from 0 to size (inclusive)\n              # Compute current progress bar for this file: floor(100*x/size)\n              p1 = (100 * x) // size   # Because floor division: (100*x)//size, but note: if 100*x is divisible by size, then floor(100*x/size) is (100*x)//size.\n\n              # Compute total progress bar: floor(100*(prev_total + x)/total)\n              p2 = (100 * (prev_total + x)) // total\n\n              if p1 == p2:\n                  # But note: p1 and p2 must be integers between 0 and 100 (inclusive). They are by construction.\n                  seen.add(p1)\n\n      But wait: what about the end of the last file? Actually, when we finish the last file, we have x = size, which we do include.\n\n      However, note that the problem says the progress bars update after each byte, including the last one.\n\n      But is this simulation correct? \n\n      Example: one file of size 6.\n\n          total = 6\n          i=0: prev_total = 0\n          x from 0 to 6:\n\n          x=0: p1 = (0)//6 = 0; p2 = (0)//6 = 0 -> add 0.\n          x=1: p1 = 100//6 = 16 (since 100*1=100, 100//6=16); p2 = (0+100*1) //6 = 100//6=16 -> add 16.\n          x=2: p1 = 200//6=33; p2 = 200//6=33 -> add 33.\n          x=3: p1 = 300//6=50; p2 = 300//6=50 -> add 50.\n          x=4: p1 = 400//6=66; p2 = 400//6=66 -> add 66.\n          x=5: p1 = 500//6=83; p2 = 500//6=83 -> add 83.\n          x=6: p1 = 600//6=100; p2 = 600//6=100 -> add 100.\n\n          Then we output: 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\n      This matches the first example.\n\n      But wait: the example input was '1\\n6' and expected output was '0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100'\n\n      However, the example provided in the note says: Input: '1\\n6' and Output: '0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100'\n\n      So our simulation matches.\n\n      Now, let's try the second example: Input: '2\\n100 500'\n\n          n=2, a=[100,500], total=600.\n\n          File0: size=100, prev_total=0\n            x from 0 to 100:\n                p1 = (100*x)//100 = x   [because 100*x/100 = x, then floor(x)=x, but wait: x is integer so floor(x)=x, but wait: \n                Actually, (100*x)//100 = x (exactly). Then p2 = (100*x)//600.\n\n                For x=0: p1=0, p2=0 -> add 0.\n                For x=1: p1=1, p2= (100)//600 = 0 -> not equal.\n                For x=2: p1=2, p2= (200)//600 = 0 -> not.\n                ...\n                For x=5: p1=5, p2= (500)//600 = 0 -> not.\n                For x=6: p1=6, p2= (600)//600 = 1 -> not.\n\n                We see that for x from 0 to 100, p1=x and p2 = floor(100*x/600). \n                When does floor(100*x/600) = x? \n                    We require x <= 100*x/600 < x+1   -> but note: p1=x and p2 must be x.\n\n                Actually, we require (100*x)//600 == x   => 100*x >= 600*x   -> 0>=500*x -> only x=0.\n\n                So for file0, we only get 0.\n\n          Now file1: size=500, prev_total=100\n            x from 0 to 500:\n                p1 = (100*x)//500\n                p2 = (100*(100+x))//600\n\n                We are looking for x such that (100*x)//500 = (100*(100+x))//600.\n\n                Note: p1 = (x*100)//500 = (x)//5   (integer division)\n\n                p2 = (100*(100+x))//600 = (10000+100*x)//600\n\n                Let's try x=0: \n                    p1=0, p2=(100*100)//600 = 10000//600 = 16 -> not equal.\n\n                x=1: p1=1//5=0, p2=(10100)//600 = 16 -> not.\n\n                ...\n\n                x=5: p1=5//5=1, p2=(100*(100+5))//600 = 10500//600 = 17 -> not.\n\n                We are looking for x such that (x//5) = (10000+100*x)//600.\n\n                Alternatively, we can note that the total progress bar is updating with the entire 600 bytes. \n\n                But note: the example output for the second test case is: 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\n                So we must have found these p values somewhere.\n\n                How?\n\n                Let me reexamine: the example input is two files: 100 and 500.\n\n                The entire process:\n\n                We start with the first file (100 bytes). After copying 0 bytes: (0,0)\n                Then we copy the first file. After each byte of the first file, the first progress bar goes from 0 to 100 (in steps of 1%) and the second progress bar goes from 0 to 16 (since 100/600 = 1/6 ~ 0.1666... -> floor(100*x/600) for x from 0 to 100: \n                    x=0: 0\n                    x=1: floor(100/600)=0\n                    ...\n                    x=5: floor(500/600)=0\n                    x=6: floor(600/600)=1\n\n                So during the first file, we only get 0 and then 1,2,...,16? Actually, we get 0 at x=0, then at x=6 we get 1, but then the first file progress bar at x=6 is 6 (since 6/100=0.06 -> 6%). \n\n                Then we move to the second file. The second file has 500 bytes. The first progress bar for the second file: \n                    It starts at 0 (at x=0 of second file) and goes to 100.\n\n                The total progress bar at the beginning of the second file: we have already 100 bytes, so the total so far is 100+x (where x is the bytes in the second file). The total is 600.\n\n                We need to find x in [0,500] such that the first progress bar (floor(100*x/500)) equals the second progress bar (floor(100*(100+x)/600)).\n\n                Also, note: we must consider that the first progress bar for the second file starts at 0 (when x=0) and then increases. \n\n                Let me check the example output: 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\n                How do we get 95?\n\n                In the second file, we require:\n                    p1 = floor(100*x/500) = 95\n                    => 95 <= 100*x/500 < 96\n                    => 95*5 <= x < 96*5   => 475 <= x < 480.\n\n                Then p2 = floor(100*(100+x)/600) must be 95.\n\n                Check x=475: \n                    p2 = floor(100*(100+475)/600) = floor(100*575/600) = floor(57500/600) = floor(95.833...) = 95 -> matches.\n\n                Similarly, x=476,477,478,479: \n                    p2 = floor(100*(100+x)/600) = floor((57600,57700,...,57900)/600) \n                    57600/600 = 96 -> so at x=476, p2 becomes 96.\n\n                So for p=95, we have x=475.\n\n                Then we must have 95 in our set.\n\n                Similarly, for 96: \n                    p1 = floor(100*x/500)=96 -> 96*5 <= x <97*5 -> 480<=x<485.\n                    Then p2 for x=480: floor(100*(100+480)/600)=floor(58000/600)=96.666... -> floor=96 -> matches.\n\n                Then we mark 96.\n\n                Similarly, 97: \n                    p1: 97*5<=x<98*5 -> 485<=x<490.\n                    x=485: p2 = floor(100*(100+485)/600)=floor(58500/600)=97.5 -> floor=97 -> matches.\n\n                98: p1: 490<=x<495 -> x=490: p2 = floor(100*(100+490)/600)=floor(59000/600)=98.333 -> floor=98.\n\n                99: p1: 495<=x<500 -> x=495: p2 = floor(100*(100+495)/600)=floor(59500/600)=99.166 -> floor=99.\n\n                100: p1: requires x>=500, so x=500: p1=floor(100*500/500)=100, p2=floor(100*(100+500)/600)=floor(60000/600)=100.\n\n                So indeed, we get 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\n          Therefore, the simulation above for the second file did catch 95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\n          But wait, why didn't we catch 95,96,97,98,99,100 in the first file? Because in the first file, the condition was never satisfied for these p values (except 0). \n\n          So the code above should work.\n\n   However, note: the example input format is given as:\n\n        ['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\n   But wait: the second example in the example input is '2\\n100 500', and the expected output is '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100'. \n\n   However, in our simulation we only iterate over the bytes of the files. The total number of iterations is the sum of the file sizes (each file from 0 to a_i). The maximum a_i is 1000, and there are at most 100 files, so maximum 100*1000 = 100000 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n   But note: the third example: '4\\n1000 2 2 998'. The total sum is 1000+2+2+998 = 2002.\n\n   We must be cautious: the condition for p=99 and p=100 might be met in the last file, but also note: the second file and third file are very small.\n\n   However, we can run the code for the third example.\n\n   But note: the example output for the third test case is: '0\\n50\\n99\\n100'\n\n   So we expect to see 0,50,99,100.\n\n   Let me check:\n\n        Files: [1000,2,2,998]\n\n        total = 2002\n\n        First file: 1000 bytes, so we'll check x from 0 to 1000.\n\n        We are interested in p=50: \n            In the first file: p1 = floor(100*x/1000)=50 -> 500 <= x < 600 -> x in [500,599]\n            Then p2 = floor(100*(x)/2002) must be 50.\n\n            For x=500: p2 = 100*500//2002 = 50000//2002 = 24 (since 2002*24=48048, 2002*25=50050 -> 50000 is less than 50050, so floor(50000/2002)=24) -> not 50.\n\n            So p=50 must occur in a later file.\n\n        Second file: size=2, so x from 0 to 2.\n            x=0: p1=0, p2= floor(100*(1000+0)/2002)= floor(100000/2002)=49 -> not 0? Actually, we have to account for the entire process: the first file is 1000, then second file adds 2. So the total so far is 1000+x. At x=0: total so far is 1000, so p2= floor(100*1000/2002)=49 -> then p1=0, so not equal.\n\n        Third file: size=2, so x from 0 to 2.\n            Total so far: 1000+2+0 = 1002, then p2= floor(100*1002/2002)=50. So we require p1 (in the third file) to be 50. But the third file has size 2, so p1 = floor(100*x/2) for x in [0,2]. \n                x=0: p1=0, p2=50 -> not equal.\n                x=1: p1=50, p2= floor(100*(1000+2+1)/2002)= floor(100300/2002)=50 (since 2002*50=100100, 100300-100100=200, so 50 + 200/2002 -> floor=50) -> so we have 50.\n\n        Fourth file: size=998, so we need to check for p=99 and p=100.\n\n        p=99: \n            In the fourth file: p1 = floor(100*x/998)=99 -> 99*998/100 <= x < 100*998/100 -> but wait: \n                99 <= 100*x/998 < 100\n                => 99*998 <= 100*x < 100*998\n                => x >= ceil(99*998/100) and x < 100*998/100.\n\n            99*998 = 98802, 98802/100 = 988.02 -> ceil(988.02)=989, and x < 998 (because 100*998/100=998). So x from 989 to 997.\n\n            Then p2 = floor(100*(1000+2+2+x)/2002) = floor(100*(1004+x)/2002)\n\n            For x=989: total_so_far = 1000+2+2+989 = 2003? Actually, wait: the files are [1000,2,2,998]. The fourth file is 998, so x cannot exceed 998. And 989 is within [0,998].\n\n            p2 = (100*(1000+2+2+989))//2002 = (100*2003)//2002 = 200300//2002 = 100 (because 2002*100=200200, 200300-200200=100, so 100 + 100/2002 -> floor=100). So p2=100, but we need 99.\n\n            Let me recast: the total so far is 1000+2+2+x, and total is 2002. So the fraction is (1004+x)/2002.\n\n            We require floor(100*(1004+x)/2002) = 99.\n\n            => 99 <= (100*(1004+x))/2002 < 100\n            => 99 * 2002 <= 100*(1004+x) < 100 * 2002\n            => 198198 <= 100400 + 100*x < 200200\n            => 198198 - 100400 <= 100*x < 200200 - 100400\n            => 97898 <= 100*x < 99800\n            => 978.98 <= x < 998\n\n            So x must be at least 979 and less than 998.\n\n            Now, also from p1: x>=989 and x<998.\n\n            So x in [989, 997].\n\n            Now, check p2 for x=989: \n                total_so_far = 1004+989 = 1993\n                p2 = 100*1993//2002 = 199300//2002 = 99 (because 2002*99=198198, 199300-198198=1102, which is less than 2002, so floor(199300/2002)=99).\n\n            So at x=989, we have p1=99 and p2=99.\n\n            Similarly, x=990 to 997: \n                x=990: p1= floor(100*990/998)= floor(99000/998)=99 (because 998*99=98802, 99000-98802=198, so 99+198/998 -> floor=99)\n                p2= floor(100*(1004+990)/2002)= floor(199400/2002)= floor(99.600...) = 99.\n\n            So p=99 is achieved.\n\n            Then p=100: \n                p1: floor(100*x/998)=100 -> x=998 (because 100*998/998=100)\n                p2: floor(100*(1004+998)/2002)= floor(100*(2002)/2002)=100.\n\n            So we have 100.\n\n        Therefore, we have 0 (from the beginning or from the first file at x=0), 50 (from the third file), 99 and 100 (from the fourth file).\n\n        The example output is: 0,50,99,100.\n\n   So the code should be:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        total = sum(a)\n        prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(n):\n            size = a[i]\n            prev_total = prefix[i]   # sum of all files before this one\n            for x in range(0, size+1):\n                # Calculate the two progress bars\n                p1 = (100 * x) // size   # because floor(100*x/size)\n                # The total so far is prev_total + x\n                p2 = (100 * (prev_total + x)) // total\n                if p1 == p2:\n                    # We record p1 (which is the common value)\n                    seen.add(p1)\n\n        # Now, we must output numbers from 0 to 100 (inclusive) that are in the set, in increasing order.\n        # But note: the set may not contain every number from 0 to 100, so we filter.\n        result = sorted([p for p in range(0,101) if p in seen])\n        for p in result:\n            print(p)\n\n   However, wait: the example input format in the problem statement is given as a list of strings, but in the actual input, we read from stdin.\n\n   But note: the example input is provided as:\n\n        ['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', ...]\n\n   But we are reading from stdin, so we do:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   This will work for the standard input.\n\n   Let me test with the first example: \n        Input: \n            1\n            6\n\n        Output: 0,16,33,50,66,83,100\n\n   The code produces: \n        n=1, a=[6], total=6\n        prefix = [0,6]\n\n        i=0: size=6, prev_total=0\n        x from 0 to 6:\n            x=0: p1=0, p2=0 -> add 0.\n            x=1: p1= (100*1)//6 = 16, p2=(100*1)//6=16 -> add 16.\n            x=2: p1= (200)//6=33, p2= (200)//6=33 -> add 33.\n            x=3: 300//6=50 -> add 5",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all the percentages (from 0 to 100 inclusive) that appear simultaneously on both progress bars during the sequential copying of files. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, while the second progress bar shows the overall percentage of all files copied so far. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires checking each byte copied in every file to see if the current file's progress matches the overall progress at that exact moment. The key insight is that for each file, as we copy each byte, we can compute both progress values and check if they are equal.\n2. **Intuition**: For each file, we iterate through all possible bytes (from 0 to the file size). For each byte, we calculate the current file's progress percentage and the overall progress percentage. If these percentages match, we note this value.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Calculating the total size of all files.\n   - Using a prefix sum array to keep track of the cumulative size of files processed before the current one.\n   - For each file, iterating through each byte (0 to file size), compute both progress bars' values, and record any matching percentages.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently checks each byte in each file. Given that the maximum file size is 1000 bytes and there are up to 100 files, the total operations are manageable (100 * 1000 = 100,000 operations), which is feasible for the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    total = sum(a)\n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] + a[i - 1]\n    \n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n):\n        size = a[i]\n        prev_total = prefix[i]\n        for x in range(0, size + 1):\n            p1 = (100 * x) // size\n            p2 = (100 * (prev_total + x)) // total\n            if p1 == p2:\n                seen.add(p1)\n                \n    result = sorted([p for p in range(0, 101) if p in seen])\n    for p in result:\n        print(p)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: It computes a prefix sum array to keep track of the cumulative size of files processed up to each point.\n3. **Progress Bar Simulation**: For each file, it simulates copying each byte (from 0 to the file size). For each byte, it calculates the current file's progress percentage (`p1`) and the overall progress percentage (`p2`). If these values match, the percentage is added to a set to avoid duplicates.\n4. **Result Compilation**: After processing all files, the code collects all unique percentages from 0 to 100 that were recorded during the simulation, sorts them, and prints them in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible moments during the file copying process to identify when both progress bars show the same percentage, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
