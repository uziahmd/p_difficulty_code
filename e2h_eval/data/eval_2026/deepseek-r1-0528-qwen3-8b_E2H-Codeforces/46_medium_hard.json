    "thought": "\n We are allowed to change at most one number. The goal is to find the longest subsegment that can be made strictly increasing by changing at most one element.\n\n Observation:\n 1. Without any change, we can have a contiguous strictly increasing segment. But we are allowed to fix one broken part.\n\n Steps:\n - We can precompute:\n   * `left[i]`: the length of the strictly increasing sequence ending exactly at index i (with a[i] being included).\n   * `right[i]`: the length of the strictly increasing sequence starting exactly at index i (so from i to j).\n\n Then, we consider two cases:\n   a) The entire segment is already strictly increasing. Then we can change one element in the middle to make it longer? Actually, we can also consider extending beyond the current increasing segments if there's a single break.\n\n However, note: the problem allows to change one element arbitrarily. So we might not need to fix a break in the middle, but we can also consider merging two increasing segments by changing one element in between.\n\n How?\n Let's say we have an array a[0..n-1].\n\n We can consider three types of possibilities:\n\n Type 1: The subsegment does not require a change (i.e., it is already strictly increasing). Then the answer is at least the length of the longest increasing contiguous segment.\n\n Type 2: The subsegment has exactly one change. Then we can have:\n\n   Case A: Change an element that is part of a run of consecutive equal numbers? Actually, note: strictly increasing requires distinct and increasing. But we can change one element arbitrarily. However, the condition is strict, so we cannot have duplicates.\n\n   Actually, we can only have one change. So we can think of:\n\n   Possibility 1: We have an increasing segment and then a drop or a rise that breaks it. But note: we can change one element to bridge the gap.\n\n Example: [7, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6]\n\n Another approach:\n\n Precompute:\n   left[i] = 1 for all i\n   for i from 1 to n-1:\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            left[i] = left[i-1] + 1\n\n   Similarly, right[i] = 1 for all i\n   for i from n-2 down to 0:\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right[i] = right[i+1] + 1\n\n Now, we can consider:\n\n   Option 1: The entire segment is already increasing: then answer is n.\n\n   But wait, even if the entire segment is increasing, we might not need to do anything, so the answer is n.\n\n   However, the problem says \"change at most one\", so we can also have segments that are already increasing.\n\n   But what if the entire segment is not increasing? Then we look for:\n\n   Consider a candidate segment that has exactly one violation. We can try to fix the violation by changing one element.\n\n   There are two kinds of violations:\n\n   1. The violation occurs at an element that is not the first or last of the segment.\n\n   2. Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n   Let's consider a candidate that is built by:\n\n     [ ... , x, y, z, ... ] and we break at y: meaning we have an increasing sequence from L to x, and then from y to R, but x >= y (or some other relation) and we can change y to something in between.\n\n   Actually, we can consider:\n\n     Case 1: The subsegment is entirely increasing -> length = max(left) or max(right) or the entire array.\n\n     Case 2: The subsegment has one change. Then we can have:\n\n        a) The change is used to fix a dip (or a peak) in the middle.\n\n        We can traverse the array and check for positions where the increasing condition breaks.\n\n        Specifically, for each index i (from 1 to n-2), we can consider:\n\n          If a[i] >= a[i+1]: then we have a break. But we can change one element to fix the break. However, note that we can also change an element that is not the one breaking the condition? \n\n        Actually, we can change one element anywhere in the segment. So we can consider:\n\n          Option: Take a segment that includes two increasing parts and change the element that is breaking the connection.\n\n        For example, at index i, we have:\n\n          Condition: \n            - The left part [L, i-1] is increasing and the right part [i+1, R] is increasing.\n            - And we can change a[i] to a value that is between a[i-1] and a[i+1] (if they exist) such that the entire segment becomes increasing.\n\n        But note: we might have two increasing sides: left side of i and right side of i.\n\n        Conditions for merging at i:\n\n          If i is the start (then we don't have left) or the end (then we don't have right), then we can merge only one side.\n\n        Actually, we can consider:\n\n          Candidate 1: The entire array is already increasing -> answer n.\n\n          Otherwise, we consider:\n\n            candidate = max( \n                left[i] + right[i] - 1,   # This would be the case when we change a[i] to bridge the two sides? Actually no, because left[i] and right[i] are defined for the immediate neighbors.\n\n            But wait, let's define:\n\n              left[i] = length of increasing ending at i (so including i)\n              right[i] = length of increasing starting at i (so including i)\n\n            Then, if we are considering a segment that breaks at i (meaning we change a[i]), then we can combine the left part (ending at i-1) and the right part (starting at i+1). But note our left[i] includes a[i] and right[i] includes a[i]. So we need to adjust.\n\n        Actually, we should define:\n\n          left_inc[i] = length of increasing sequence ending at i (without requiring the next to be present, just the contiguous one ending at i)\n          right_inc[i] = length of increasing sequence starting at i.\n\n        Then, consider:\n\n          Option 1: Without any change, the maximum length is max_i(left_inc[i]) (or also we can use the entire array if increasing).\n\n          Option 2: With one change, we can consider:\n\n            For each index i (from 0 to n-1):\n\n            Case 1: The entire segment is already increasing: then we get n.\n\n            Case 2: We can consider a segment that excludes one element and then the rest is increasing? Or we can consider a segment that includes two increasing parts by changing the element at i.\n\n            Actually, we can consider:\n\n              candidate = left_inc[i] + right_inc[i]   [but wait, this counts the element i twice?]\n\n            Let me reframe:\n\n            We want to form a segment [L, R] that is strictly increasing, and we are allowed to change one element (which can be at any position). The change can be at the beginning, middle, or end.\n\n            We can break the segment into two parts: the part before the changed element and the part after.\n\n            However, we can consider:\n\n              Consider the entire array. We can remove one element and then check if the remaining is strictly increasing? But that is too expensive.\n\n            Alternate approach:\n\n            We can consider the following:\n\n              Let dp0[i] = the length of the increasing segment ending at i without any changes so far.\n              Let dp1[i] = the length of the increasing segment ending at i with one change allowed (and that change is used at some point up to i).\n\n            However, the problem asks for the longest subsegment that can be fixed with at most one change.\n\n            We can use:\n\n              Let L[i] = length of increasing ending at i (without change)\n              Let R[i] = length of increasing starting at i (without change)\n\n            Then, if we change the element at i, then we can combine the increasing segments that are adjacent to i, provided that the conditions hold:\n\n              Condition for combining left and right:\n\n                If i is the first element, then we can use the entire right_inc[i] (since we change the first element, we can set it to anything and then the rest must be increasing). Similarly for the last.\n\n                But if we change an element in the middle, then we require:\n\n                  The left side must end at i-1 and the right side must start at i+1, and we can set a[i] to a value that is greater than a[i-1] and less than a[i+1] (if both sides exist). However, what if one side doesn't exist?\n\n            Actually, we can consider:\n\n              candidate1 = max(L)   # no change needed\n\n              candidate2: change an element that is not the first or last:\n\n                We look at indices i (from 1 to n-2). Then we can consider:\n\n                  If a[i-1] < a[i+1], then we can set a[i] to a value between a[i-1] and a[i+1] (for example, (a[i-1]+a[i+1])//2, but we don't care about the exact value) and then the entire segment from (i-L[i]+1) to (i+R[i]-1) would be fixed? Actually, we can combine the left part (of length L[i-1]) and the right part (of length R[i+1]) and then the total length is L[i-1] + R[i+1] + 1 (because we include the changed element at i). But note: the left part ends at i-1, and the right part starts at i+1, so we are inserting at i.\n\n                However, we must ensure that the left part and the right part are connected by the change. The condition is that the last element of the left part (at index i-1) must be less than the first element of the right part (at index i+1). Then we can set a[i] to be between them.\n\n                But note: the left part ending at i-1 is of length L[i-1] (so the element at i-1 is the last, and the one before is a[i-2] etc.). Similarly, the right part starting at i+1 is of length R[i+1] (so the first element is a[i+1] and the next is a[i+2] etc.).\n\n                Therefore, if a[i-1] < a[i+1], then we can form a segment of length L[i-1] + 1 + R[i+1] (the 1 is for the changed element at i).\n\n                However, what if the left part or the right part is of length 1? Then we can still use the change to connect.\n\n                But wait: if the left part is of length 1, then we are only looking at a[i-1] (the element at i-1) and the right part of length 1, then we have a[i-1] < a[i+1] and we can set a[i] to a value between them. Then the entire segment [i-1, i, i+1] is increasing.\n\n                Also, we can consider the possibility that the change is at the beginning or the end.\n\n              Case 3: Change the first element: then the segment can be the entire right part (from index0 to ...) but wait, we can change the first element arbitrarily. Then the condition for the rest of the segment (from index0 to index k) is that the segment from index1 to index k is increasing (with the change at index0). Then the length is 1 + (length of the increasing segment starting at index1). But note: the changed element at index0 must be less than a[1]. Since we can set it arbitrarily, we can set it to any value less than a[1]. So the entire segment from 0 to k (where k is the end of the increasing segment starting at index1) is acceptable.\n\n                Similarly, for the last element.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n              candidate = max(\n                  candidate1,   # no change\n                  candidate2,   # change in the middle (if exists)\n                  candidate3,   # change at the beginning: 1 + right_inc[1] (if n>=2)\n                  candidate4    # change at the end: left_inc[n-2] + 1   (because the last element is changed, then the left part is from 0 to n-2, and then the last element is changed to be greater than a[n-2])\n              )\n\n            However, note: we can change an element in the middle and the segment might extend beyond the immediate left and right? Actually, no: the left_inc[i-1] is the entire increasing run ending at i-1, and the right_inc[i+1] is the entire increasing run starting at i+1.\n\n            But wait: we must consider that the change is only allowed once, and we are allowed to choose any integer. So the entire segment we consider is from (start of left_inc[i-1] to the end of right_inc[i+1]) and we change the element at i.\n\n            However, we must check that the two parts are compatible: a[i-1] < a[i+1] (so that we can set a[i] to a value in between). If they are not, then we cannot merge the two parts by changing a[i].\n\n            But what if the left part and the right part are compatible even if the immediate neighbor condition fails? Actually, no: because we are only allowed to change one element, and we are changing the element at i. Then the condition for the entire segment is:\n\n              ... , a[i-1], (changed value), a[i+1], ...\n\n            So we must have a[i-1] < (changed value) < a[i+1] OR if we are changing the first element then we only have a constraint from the right (must be < a[1]), and similarly for the last.\n\n            Therefore, the conditions:\n\n              For an interior change (i from 1 to n-2):\n                if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                    candidate = max(candidate, left_inc[i-1] + right_inc[i+1] + 1)\n\n              For the beginning (i=0):\n                candidate = max(candidate, right_inc[1] + 1)   [if n>=2]\n\n              For the end (i=n-1):\n                candidate = max(candidate, left_inc[n-2] + 1)   [if n>=2]\n\n            However, what if the entire array is increasing? Then we don't need to change, but note that we are also allowed to change one element arbitrarily. But the above candidate for no change is the entire array? Actually, we have candidate1 = max(left_inc) which is n (if entire array is increasing). But wait, left_inc[i] is the increasing run ending at i. In an increasing array, left_inc[n-1] = n, so candidate1 = n.\n\n            But also, we can consider: what if the array is not increasing, but we can change one element to make the entire array increasing? Then the above candidate for the entire array might be considered as well.\n\n            However, note: the problem asks for the longest subsegment (not necessarily the entire array). So we can consider a subsegment that is almost the entire array, but if the entire array is not increasing, then we might not be able to fix the entire array by changing one element.\n\n            But wait: our candidate2 (interior) and candidate3,4 are for contiguous subsegments. The entire array is a contiguous subsegment.\n\n            However, we must consider that the entire array might be fixed by changing one element. Then we would output n.\n\n            But note: the above candidate for the entire array is considered if we change an element in the middle (candidate2) and then the left_inc[-1] (if we take i from 0 to n-1) but our left_inc and right_inc arrays are defined for the entire array.\n\n            Actually, the above candidate2 formula for an interior element i uses left_inc[i-1] and right_inc[i+1]. Then the entire array would be considered if we change an element in the middle and the two sides together cover the entire array.\n\n            But what if the array is not increasing, but we can fix it by changing one element? Then candidate2 might pick up the entire array.\n\n            However, we must also consider that the entire array might be fixed by changing an element that is not in the middle? Actually, the above formulas for the boundaries (beginning and end) would also consider the entire array if the array is fixed by changing the first or last element.\n\n            But note: the entire array is contiguous, and we are allowed to change one element arbitrarily.\n\n            However, there is a catch: the above candidate2 condition (a[i-1] < a[i+1]) is necessary for the middle change. But if we change an element in the middle, the entire array might be fixed only if the two sides are increasing and the condition holds. But what if the array is fixed by changing an element that is not at the break? Actually, the breaks might be multiple.\n\n            Let me clarify: we are allowed to change one element. Then the entire array can be fixed only if there is at most one violation (and that violation is fixed by changing one element). But note: the entire array might have more than one violation. However, we are allowed to change one element arbitrarily. Then we can fix multiple violations if they are caused by a single bad element? \n\n            Example: [1, 3, 2, 4] -> if we change the 2 to 3, then we get [1,3,3,4] which is not strictly increasing. But wait, strictly increasing requires distinct and increasing. So we cannot have two consecutive 3s. Therefore, we must change the 2 to something else, say 2.5, but then [1,3,2.5,4] is increasing.\n\n            However, the problem states: change one number to any integer. So we can change to an integer. But note: the problem does not require the resulting numbers to be integers? Actually, the input are integers, but the change can be to any integer. So we can change to any integer. Then in the example [1,3,2,4] we can change the 2 to 3, but then we have [1,3,3,4] which is not strictly increasing. Alternatively, we can change the 3 (the second element) to 2, then we get [1,2,2,4] -> not strictly increasing. Or change the 3 to 0, then [1,0,2,4] -> not increasing.\n\n            Actually, the example [1,3,2,4] is fixed by changing the 2 to 0? Then [1,3,0,4] -> no. Or change the 2 to 4? Then [1,3,4,4] -> no.\n\n            Alternatively, change the 3 to 2: [1,2,2,4] -> no.\n\n            Actually, we cannot fix [1,3,2,4] by changing one element to an integer? Because we require strictly increasing. The requirement is that every adjacent pair must be strictly increasing. \n\n            In [1,3,2,4]:\n                [1,3] is good, [3,2] is bad, [2,4] is good.\n\n            We can change the 3 (at index1) to a number between 1 and 2? Then we get [1, x, 2,4] with x in (1,2). But x must be an integer, so no integer between 1 and 2. Therefore, we cannot fix [1,3,2,4] by changing one element.\n\n            So the entire array cannot be fixed.\n\n            However, we can fix a subsegment of length 3: [1,3,4] by changing the 2 to 3 (but then [1,3,3] is not strictly increasing). Alternatively, fix [1,2,4] by changing the 3 to 2: then [1,2,2,4] is not strictly increasing.\n\n            Actually, the example [1,3,2,4] has two possibilities for subsegments of length 3:\n\n              [1,3,2]: change the 3 to 1.5 (non-integer) but the problem says we can change to any integer. So we cannot change the 3 to 1.5. But we can change the 2 to 4? Then [1,3,4] is increasing. Then the subsegment [1,3,2] becomes [1,3,4] if we change the 2 to 4. But wait, we are only allowed to change one element. Then we can change the 2 to 4, and then the entire subsegment [1,3,2] becomes [1,3,4] which is increasing. Then the length is 3.\n\n            But wait, the original subsegment was [1,3,2] (indices0 to 2). After changing the last element (index2) to 4, we have [1,3,4] which is strictly increasing.\n\n            However, note: the problem does not require the entire contiguous subsegment to be fixed by changing one element, and we are allowed to choose any contiguous subsegment. So we can choose a subsegment that is [1,3,2] and change the last element to 4, then it becomes [1,3,4] (strictly increasing). But the subsegment [1,3,2] is of length 3, and we can also consider the entire array [1,3,2,4] (length4) if we change the 3 (index1) to 0: [1,0,2,4] is strictly increasing? No, because 1>0 is false (it's decreasing). Or change the 3 to 2: [1,2,2,4] -> not strictly increasing.\n\n            Actually, the entire array [1,3,2,4] cannot be fixed by one change (to an integer) because:\n\n              Option 1: Change the first element (1) to 0: [0,3,2,4] -> 0<3 -> ok, but 3>2 -> bad.\n              Option 2: Change the first element to 2: [2,3,2,4] -> 2<3 -> ok, but 3>2 -> bad.\n              Option 3: Change the first element to 4: [4,3,2,4] -> 4>3 -> bad.\n              Option 4: Change the second element (3): \n                 to 0: [1,0,2,4] -> 1>0 -> bad.\n                 to 1: [1,1,2,4] -> 1==1 -> not strictly increasing.\n                 to 2: [1,2,2,4] -> 2==2 -> bad.\n                 to 3: same as original.\n                 to 4: [1,4,2,4] -> 1<4 -> ok, but 4>2 -> bad.\n              Option 5: Change the third element (2):\n                 to 0: [1,3,0,4] -> 3>0 -> bad.\n                 to 1: [1,3,1,4] -> 3>1 -> bad.\n                 to 3: [1,3,3,4] -> 3==3 -> bad.\n                 to 4: [1,3,4,4] -> 4==4 -> bad.\n              Option 6: Change the last element (4):\n                 to 0: [1,3,2,0] -> 3>2 -> bad.\n                 to 1: [1,3,2,1] -> 3>2 -> bad.\n                 to 2: [1,3,2,2] -> 2==2 -> bad.\n                 to 3: [1,3,2,3] -> 2<3 -> ok, but the entire array: [1,3,2,3] -> 1<3 -> ok, 3>2 -> bad.\n\n            So indeed, the entire array cannot be fixed.\n\n            Therefore, we must consider only contiguous subsegments.\n\n            Algorithm:\n\n            Step 1: Precompute left_inc and right_inc.\n\n            Step 2: candidate = max(left_inc)   (this is the maximum increasing segment without any change)\n\n            Step 3: For each index i from 0 to n-1:\n\n                    if i == 0:\n                        if n >= 2:\n                            candidate = max(candidate, 1 + right_inc[1])   # change the first element, then the rest from index1 to the end must be increasing (which it is, by definition of right_inc[1])\n                        else:\n                            candidate = max(candidate, 1)   # if n==1, then we don't have the above condition.\n\n                    elif i == n-1:\n                        if n >= 2:\n                            candidate = max(candidate, left_inc[n-2] + 1)\n                        else:\n                            candidate = max(candidate, 1)\n\n                    else:\n                        # i is from 1 to n-2\n                        # Check if we can merge the left part (ending at i-1) and the right part (starting at i+1) by changing a[i]\n                        if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                            # Then we can set a[i] to a value between a[i-1] and a[i+1] (if they are integers, we can choose an integer in between if the gap is at least 2, but if the gap is 1 then we cannot choose an integer between them? However, note: the condition for the entire segment is strict increasing, so we need a[i] to be strictly between. But the problem allows any integer. So if the gap is 1, then there is no integer between a[i-1] and a[i+1] (if a[i-1] and a[i+1] are consecutive integers, then no integer in between). But wait: if a[i-1]=1 and a[i+1]=3, then we can set a[i] to 2. But if a[i-1]=1 and a[i+1]=2, then we cannot set a[i] to an integer between 1 and 2. So we must check: if a[i+1] - a[i-1] > 1, then there exists an integer between them.\n\n                            # However, note: we are allowed to change one element arbitrarily. We don't require the changed element to be the only one that matters. But the condition for the entire segment is that the entire segment is strictly increasing.\n\n                            # Actually, we can set a[i] to any integer. So if a[i-1] < a[i+1], then we can set a[i] to an integer in (a[i-1], a[i+1]). But if a[i-1] and a[i+1] are consecutive integers, then there is no integer in between. So the condition should be: a[i+1] - a[i-1] > 1.\n\n                            # However, note: the condition for the entire segment is:\n\n                            #   a[i-1] < (new a[i]) < a[i+1]\n\n                            # So we require that the interval (a[i-1], a[i+1]) contains at least one integer. That is true if a[i+1] - a[i-1] > 1.\n\n                            if a[i+1] - a[i-1] > 1:\n                                # Then we can set a[i] to an integer between a[i-1] and a[i+1].\n                                seg_length = left_inc[i-1] + right_inc[i+1] + 1\n                                candidate = max(candidate, seg_length)\n\n            Step 4: Print candidate.\n\n            However, wait: what if the entire array is increasing? Then candidate from step2 is n, and in step3 for the entire array, we consider an interior change and the condition a[i-1] < a[i+1] holds, and the gap might be more than 1. But then we would compute a segment of length (left_inc[i-1] + right_inc[i+1] + 1) which is at least 3 (if i is in the middle) but we already have n from step2.\n\n            So we don't need to worry.\n\n            But wait: what if the entire array is increasing, then left_inc[i-1] = i (if i-1 is the index) and right_inc[i+1] = n - (i+1) + 1 = n-i, then the segment length is i + (n-i) + 1 = n+1. But wait, that would exceed the array length.\n\n            Actually, note: the entire array is increasing, so the entire array is a candidate from step2 (candidate = n). But in step3, we are considering a segment that goes from the beginning of the left_inc[i-1] to the end of right_inc[i+1]. However, if the entire array is increasing, then left_inc[i-1] = i (if i-1 is the last index of the left part) and right_inc[i+1] = n - i (if i+1 is the first index of the right part). Then the segment we are considering is from (i - left_inc[i-1] + 1) to (i+1 + right_inc[i+1] - 1) which is from (i - i + 1) to (i+1 + n-i - 1) = from 1 to n, which is the entire array. But then the length is left_inc[i-1] + 1 + right_inc[i+1] = i + 1 + (n-i) = n+1. That's wrong.\n\n            Why? Our left_inc[i-1] is the length of the increasing sequence ending at i-1, which is the entire part from 0 to i-1 (so i elements). Similarly, right_inc[i+1] is the length of the increasing sequence starting at i+1, which is from i+1 to n-1 (n-i-1+1 = n-i). Then the entire segment we are considering is from 0 to n-1, but we are counting the element i (which we change) and the left_inc[i-1] and right_inc[i+1] do not include the changed element? Actually, the segment we are forming is:\n\n                [ (start of left_inc[i-1]), ..., a[i-1], (changed a[i]), a[i+1], ... (end of right_inc[i+1]) ]\n\n            The total length is left_inc[i-1] (which is the count from the start until i-1) plus 1 (for the changed element) plus right_inc[i+1] (the count from i+1 to the end). But note: the entire array has n elements. The left_inc[i-1] is i (because the array is increasing and we are at i-1, so the increasing run from 0 to i-1 is i elements). Then the changed element is at i, and then the right_inc[i+1] is n - i - 1 (if we are using 0-indexed, then from i+1 to n-1 there are n-i-1 elements). Then the total length is i + 1 + (n-i-1) = n. \n\n            Wait, I think I messed up the definitions:\n\n            We defined:\n              left_inc[i] = length of increasing sequence ending at i (so including a[i])\n\n            Then, for the left part ending at i-1, the length is left_inc[i-1] = (number of elements from j to i-1) which is (i) because the array is increasing and we start at 0.\n\n            Then the right_inc[i+1] = (number of elements from i+1 to n-1) = n - i - 1.\n\n            Then the segment we are forming is from index0 to index n-1, and the length is:\n\n                left_inc[i-1] (which is i) + 1 (for the changed element) + right_inc[i+1] (which is n-i-1) = i + 1 + (n-i-1) = n.\n\n            So that is correct.\n\n            However, the problem is that the above candidate for the entire array is already considered in step2 (candidate1 = n). So we don't need to worry.\n\n            But wait, what if the entire array is increasing, then we have candidate1 = n. Then step3 will also consider n (for the entire array) and that is okay.\n\n            But note: we must consider that the entire array might be fixed by changing an element that is not necessary. However, the problem allows at most one change, so we can leave the array unchanged (so no change) and that is covered by candidate1.\n\n            However, what if the entire array is not increasing, but we can fix the entire array by changing one element? Then candidate1 (the maximum increasing contiguous segment) might be less than n, but our candidate2 (step3) for the entire array (if we change an element in the middle) might yield n.\n\n            Example: [1, 3, 2, 4] -> we saw that we cannot fix the entire array, but what about [1, 2, 3, 2]?\n\n            [1,2,3,2]: \n                Without change: the increasing segments are [1,2,3] (length3) and [2] (length1) at the end.\n\n                Can we fix the entire array by changing the last element? Change the last 2 to 4: [1,2,3,4] -> strictly increasing. Then the entire array is fixed.\n\n            How is that captured?\n\n            In step3, we consider the last element (i=3). Then we do:\n\n                i=3: last element, so candidate4: left_inc[2] + 1.\n\n                left_inc[2]: \n                    a[0]=1, a[1]=2, a[2]=3 -> increasing, so left_inc[2]=3 (because from index0 to index2, 3 elements).\n                Then candidate4 = 3+1 = 4.\n\n            So we capture the entire array.\n\n            But how do we capture the entire array if we change an element in the middle? \n\n            Example: [1, 5, 3, 4] \n                Without change: the increasing segments: [1] (length1), [5] (length1), [3,4] (length2). \n                But we can change the 5 to 2: then [1,2,3,4] -> entire array is fixed.\n\n            In step3, we consider i=1 (the element 5). Then condition: a[0]=1, a[2]=3 -> 1 < 3, and 3-1>1 -> yes, so we can set a[1] to 2 (an integer between 1 and 3). Then the segment length = left_inc[0] (which is 1) + right_inc[2] (which is 2) + 1 = 1+2+1=4.\n\n            So it works.\n\n            However, note: we must be cautious because the left_inc[i-1] and right_inc[i+1] are defined independently. They are the maximal increasing runs that end at i-1 and start at i+1 respectively.\n\n            But in the example [1,5,3,4]: \n                left_inc[0] = 1 (since [1] is increasing)\n                right_inc[2] = 2 (since [3,4] is increasing)\n\n            Then the segment we form is from index0 to index3 (the entire array) and we change index1. That is correct.\n\n            One more example: [1, 3, 2, 4] (which we know cannot be fixed) but what if we change the second element (3) to 0? Then [1,0,2,4] is not increasing. Or change the second element to 2: [1,2,2,4] is not strictly increasing. So no integer change fixes the entire array.\n\n            Now, what about a subsegment that is not the entire array? \n\n            Example: [1, 3, 2, 4] -> we can take the subsegment [1,3,2] and change the 2 to 4, then we get [1,3,4] (strictly increasing) -> length=3.\n\n            How do we capture that?\n\n            We are considering contiguous subsegments that are fixed by one change. We consider:\n\n            Step2: candidate1 = max(left_inc) = max([1,1,2,2]) = 2.\n\n            Step3: \n                i=0: candidate = max(2, 1+right_inc[1]) -> right_inc[1] = length of increasing starting at index1: [3,2,4] -> the increasing run starting at index1: [3,2] is not increasing, so right_inc[1] = 1 (because [3] is increasing). Then candidate = max(2, 1+1)=max(2,2)=2.\n\n                i=1: condition: a[0]=1, a[2]=2 -> 1<2, and 2-1>1 -> True. Then candidate = max(2, left_inc[0] (which is 1) + right_inc[2] (which is 2) + 1) = 1+2+1=4 -> but wait, we are considering the entire array? But",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the longest contiguous subsegment of an array where we can change at most one element to make the entire subsegment strictly increasing. The solution involves analyzing the array to identify the longest such subsegment efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Increasing Segments**: \n   - **Left Increasing Array (`left_inc`)**: For each element `a[i]`, `left_inc[i]` stores the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment ending at `i`.\n   - **Right Increasing Array (`right_inc`)**: Similarly, `right_inc[i]` stores the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment starting at `i`.\n\n2. **Initial Candidate (No Change)**: The maximum value in `left_inc` gives the longest strictly increasing subsegment without any changes.\n\n3. **Check for One Change**:\n   - **Beginning or End**: If changing the first or last element allows merging with adjacent elements, consider the combined length.\n   - **Middle Elements**: For each middle element, check if the adjacent elements can be bridged by changing the current element. This is possible if the left neighbor is less than the right neighbor and there exists an integer between them (i.e., their difference is more than 1). The combined length of the left and right increasing segments plus one (for the changed element) is a candidate.\n\n4. **Determine Maximum Length**: The solution is the maximum value obtained from the initial candidate and all possible changes considered in the previous step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    left_inc = [1] * n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            left_inc[i] = left_inc[i-1] + 1\n            \n    right_inc = [1] * n\n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right_inc[i] = right_inc[i+1] + 1\n            \n    candidate = max(left_inc)\n    \n    if a[0] < a[1]:\n        candidate = max(candidate, right_inc[1] + 1)\n    else:\n        if n >= 2:\n            candidate = max(candidate, right_inc[1] + 1)\n    \n    if n >= 2:\n        if a[n-2] < a[n-1]:\n            candidate = max(candidate, left_inc[n-2] + 1)\n        else:\n            candidate = max(candidate, left_inc[n-2] + 1)\n            \n    for i in range(1, n-1):\n        if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n            if a[i+1] - a[i-1] > 1:\n                seg_length = left_inc[i-1] + right_inc[i+1] + 1\n                if seg_length > candidate:\n                    candidate = seg_length\n                    \n    print(candidate)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the array size and the array elements.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the array has only one element, the answer is trivially 1.\n3. **Left and Right Arrays**: The `left_inc` array is filled by traversing from left to right, incrementing the count if the current element is greater than the previous one. Similarly, `right_inc` is filled by traversing from right to left.\n4. **Initial Candidate**: The maximum value in `left_inc` is the longest strictly increasing subsegment without any changes.\n5. **Beginning and End Checks**: Changing the first or last element might allow extending the increasing subsegment. The conditions ensure that the change makes the entire segment strictly increasing.\n6. **Middle Element Check**: For each middle element, if the adjacent elements can be bridged by changing the current element (i.e., there exists an integer between them), the combined length of the left and right increasing segments plus one is considered.\n7. **Output**: The maximum length found during the checks is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible segments that can be made strictly increasing with at most one change, leveraging precomputed arrays to avoid redundant calculations.",
