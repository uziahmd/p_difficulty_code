The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The problem states that the plate is a rectangle of size w x h (rows x columns).\n We are to add k gilded rings. The first ring goes along the edge, the second 2 cells away, etc.\n\n For the i-th ring (starting at i=1), the ring is drawn on the inner rectangle of size:\n   w' = w - 4*(i-1)\n   h' = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n But note: the ring has width 1 cell, and it is the border of this inner rectangle.\n\n The number of cells in a border for a rectangle of size a x b is: 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n However, we must be cautious because if a or b becomes less than or equal to 0, we stop.\n\n But note the constraint: k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). This means that we are guaranteed that for the k-th ring, \n the inner rectangle has positive dimensions? Actually, the condition is that the ring exists only if the inner rectangle has at least 2x2?\n Because a ring requires at least a border (so the inner rectangle must have at least 2 rows and 2 columns to form a border?).\n\n However, the problem says: \"the first one should go along the edge\", so the outermost ring is always there.\n\n But note: the input constraint for k: k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4) implies that we don't have to worry about negative dimensions.\n\n How many cells does the i-th ring have?\n   Let a_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n   Let b_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n Then the i-th ring (for i>=1) is the border of the a_i x b_i rectangle, which has:\n   If a_i < 2 or b_i < 2, then we cannot form a border (but our k is chosen such that we don't get negative, but note: the border requires at least 2x2 to have a non-zero border? Actually, for a 1x1, the border would be 1, but the problem says the first ring goes along the edge of the plate (which is at least 3x3, so the first ring is 8). \n\n However, note the example: Input \"3 3 1\" -> Output 8.\n\n But wait: for the first ring (i=1):\n   a1 = 3, b1 = 3.\n   The border of 3x3: 3*4 - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8? Actually, the formula for the border of an a x b rectangle is 2*(a+b) - 4.\n\n Let me verify with 3x3: \n   top and bottom: 3 + 3 = 6, left and right: 3+3 = 6, but subtract the 4 corners that were counted twice -> 6+6-4 = 8.\n\n So the i-th ring has: 2*(a_i + b_i) - 4, provided that a_i >= 2 and b_i >= 2.\n\n However, what if a_i or b_i is 1? Then the border might be just a single row (if one dimension is 1, then we have two sides of length 1, but wait, no: actually, the border of a 1x1 is 1? But the problem says the ring has width 1 and is the bordering cells. In fact, the problem says the first ring is the edge of the plate, and the plate is at least 3x3.\n\n But note: the constraint on k: k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). For example, if w=3, h=3, then min(w,h)=3, so floor((3+1)/4)=floor(4/4)=1. So k can be at most 1.\n\n Similarly, if w=7, h=9, then min(w,h)=7 -> floor((7+1)/4)=floor(8/4)=2.\n\n Now, let's compute the second ring for 7x9:\n   First ring: i=1 -> a1=7, b1=9 -> 2*(7+9)-4 = 2*16-4 = 32-4 = 28 -> matches the first example output for \"7 9 1\" is 28.\n   Second ring: i=2 -> a2=7-4=3, b2=9-4=5 -> 2*(3+5)-4 = 2*8-4 = 16-4 = 12.\n\n Then total for two rings",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. The first ring is placed along the edge of the plate, and each subsequent ring is placed 2 cells away from the previous one, with each ring having a width of 1 cell. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that each ring corresponds to the border of an inner rectangle. For the i-th ring, the inner rectangle's dimensions are reduced by 4*(i-1) from both the width and height of the original plate. The number of cells in the i-th ring is given by the formula for the perimeter of the inner rectangle minus the overlapping corners, which simplifies to \\(2 \\times (a_i + b_i) - 4\\), where \\(a_i\\) and \\(b_i\\) are the dimensions of the inner rectangle.\n\n2. **Constraints Handling**: The input constraints ensure that the number of rings \\(k\\) is such that all inner rectangles have positive dimensions. Specifically, \\(k\\) is limited to \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\min(w, h) + 1}{4} \\right\\rfloor\\), which guarantees that all computed inner rectangles for the given \\(k\\) will have valid dimensions (at least 2x2).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each ring from 1 to \\(k\\), compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle and apply the perimeter formula. Summing these values gives the total number of cells to be gilded.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total_cells = 0\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        a = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n        b = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n        if a < 2 or b < 2:\n            break\n        total_cells += 2 * (a + b) - 4\n    print(total_cells)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The program reads three integers \\(w\\), \\(h\\), and \\(k\\) representing the plate dimensions and the number of rings.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to \\(k\\), the program calculates the dimensions of the inner rectangle by subtracting \\(4*(i-1)\\) from both width and height.\n3. **Check Validity**: If at any point the inner rectangle's dimensions fall below 2x2, the loop breaks early as further rings would not contribute any cells.\n4. **Calculate Cells**: For each valid ring, the number of cells is computed using the formula \\(2*(a + b) - 4\\) and added to the total.\n5. **Output Result**: The total number of cells to be gilded is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging mathematical insights about the problem structure, ensuring correctness and optimal performance within the given constraints.",
