The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to use the condition: a_i + b_j ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n This means that if a_i is even, then we need a key with odd integer (b_j) to open it.\n Similarly, if a_i is odd, then we need a key with even integer (b_j) to open it.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Separate the chests into two groups:\n    - Group0 (even numbers): let E = number of even chests\n    - Group1 (odd numbers): let O = number of odd chests\n\n 2. Separate the keys into two groups:\n    - Group0 (even numbers): let KE = count of even keys\n    - Group1 (odd numbers): let KO = count of odd keys\n\n However, note: \n   - An even chest requires an odd key.\n   - An odd chest requires an even key.\n\n But wait, there's a catch: one key can only be used once.\n\n So, we can model this as a bipartite graph matching problem? But note the constraints (up to 10^5) so we need an efficient solution.\n\n Alternatively, we can think:\n\n Let x = number of even chests we open. Then we must use x odd keys for them.\n Then the remaining keys (which are even keys) must be used for the remaining odd chests. The number of odd chests we can open is at most (total_odd_chests) but also limited by the available even keys.\n\n However, note that the keys are shared: the odd keys used for even chests cannot be used for odd chests, and vice versa.\n\n Actually, the maximum number of chests we can open is limited by:\n\n   Let u = min(E, KO)   [number of even chests we can open, using odd keys]\n   Then we have remaining odd keys: KO - u, but wait, no: actually we are not forced to use all odd keys for even chests.\n\n Another way:\n\n We can open at most:\n   For even chests: we can use at most min(E, KO) [because we need KO odd keys] but then the odd chests can be opened by the remaining even keys: min(O, KE_remaining) where KE_remaining is the total even keys minus the even keys used for ... wait, no.\n\n Actually, the odd keys are only used for even chests, and even keys are only used for odd chests.\n\n Therefore, the matching is independent.\n\n So:\n   Let x = number of even chests we open. Then x <= E and x <= KO.\n   Similarly, let y = number of odd chests we open. Then y <= O and y <= KE.\n\n But note: the same key cannot be used twice, and the total keys are fixed.\n\n However, the catch is that the entire set of keys is partitioned: odd keys and even keys.\n\n Therefore, we cannot use an odd key for an odd chest and vice versa.\n\n So the maximum chests we can open is the sum of two independent matchings:\n\n   x = min(E, KO)   [but wait, we are not forced to use exactly min(E, KO) for even chests? Actually, we can choose to use fewer odd keys for even chests so that we can use more even keys for odd chests? \n\n But note: the problem does not require that we use all keys. We just want to maximize the number of chests.\n\n However, the two sets of keys (even and odd) are separate and the two sets of chests (even and odd) are separate.\n\n Therefore, the maximum chests we can open is:\n\n   x (even chests) + y (odd chests)\n\n where:\n   x can be any number from 0 to min(E, KO)\n   y can be any number from 0 to min(O, KE)\n\n But wait: we have a fixed set of keys. The odd keys are used for even chests, and the even keys are used for odd chests. There is no overlap.\n\n However, note: the total number of keys is fixed. But since the two types of keys are distinct and the two types of chests are distinct, the usage is independent.\n\n But consider: if we use some odd keys for even chests, then the remaining odd keys are still available? Actually, no: the odd keys are only used for even chests, and the even keys are only used for odd chests.\n\n So the two matchings are independent. Therefore, we can open up to:\n\n   x = min(E, KO)   [for even chests with odd keys]\n   y = min(O, KE)   [for odd chests with even keys]\n\n Then total = x + y.\n\n However, wait: what if we don't use all odd keys for even chests? Could we get a better total by leaving some odd keys unused and use even keys more for odd chests? Actually, no, because the even keys are only used for odd chests and we are already using the maximum possible for odd chests (min(O, KE)), and similarly for even chests.\n\n But note: the two sets of keys are separate. The odd keys are only used for even chests, so the maximum even chests we can open is min(E, KO). Similarly, the maximum odd chests we can open is min(O, KE). And these two do not interfere.\n\n However, wait: is that really independent? Consider:\n\n   We have two independent bipartite graphs: \n     Graph1: even chests (E nodes) and odd keys (KO nodes)\n     Graph2: odd chests (O nodes) and even keys (KE nodes)\n\n And since the edges are disjoint (one type of key for one type of chest), we can indeed open min(E, KO) chests from the even group and min(O, KE) chests from the odd group.\n\n But wait, the example:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\"\n\n   Chests: [9,14,6,2,11] -> even: [14,6,2] (3), odd: [9,11] (2)\n   Keys:   [8,4,7,20] -> even: [8,4,20] (3), odd: [7] (1)\n\n   Then according to our method:\n        even chests: min(3, 1) = 1\n        odd chests: min(2, 3) = 2\n        total = 1+2 = 3 -> which matches.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n   Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> E=5, O=0\n   Keys: [5] -> odd:1, even:0\n   Then: even chests: min(5,1)=1, odd chests: min(0,0)=0 -> total=1 -> matches.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n   Chests: [10] -> even -> E=1, O=0\n   Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> KE=4, KO=0\n   Then: even chests: min(1,0)=0, odd chests: min(0,4)=0 -> total=0 -> matches.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   Read n, m\n   Read list a of n integers\n   Read list b of m integers\n\n   Count even and odd in a:\n        E = count of even numbers in a (a_i % 2 == 0)\n        O = n - E   (or count odd numbers)\n\n   Count even and odd in b:\n        KE = count of even numbers in b (b_j % 2 == 0)\n        KO = m - KE\n\n   Answer = min(E, KO) + min(O, KE)\n\n But wait: is that always correct?\n\n Let me test with another example:\n\n Example 4:\n   Chests: [2,3] -> E=1, O=1\n   Keys: [1,4] -> odd:1, even:1\n\n   Then: even chests: min(1,1)=1; odd chests: min(1,1)=1 -> total=2.\n\n   Check: \n      Chest2 (even) needs odd key -> use key1 (odd) -> opens chest2.\n      Chest3 (odd) needs even key -> use key4 (even) -> opens chest3.\n\n   So yes, 2 is correct.\n\n Example 5:\n   Chests: [2,3] -> E=1, O=1\n   Keys: [1,2] -> odd:1, even:1\n\n   Same as above: 2.\n\n Example 6:\n   Chests: [2,3] -> E=1, O=1\n   Keys: [1] -> odd:1, even:0\n\n   Then: even chests: min(1,1)=1; odd chests: min(1,0)=0 -> total=1.\n\n   Correct: we can open the even chest (with key1) but the odd chest requires an even key which we don't have.\n\n Example 7:\n   Chests: [2,3] -> E=1, O=1\n   Keys: [2] -> even:1, odd:0\n\n   Then: even chests: min(1,0)=0; odd chests: min(1,1)=1 -> total=1.\n\n   Correct: we can open the odd chest (with key2) but the even chest requires an odd key which we don't have.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   a_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   b_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   E_chest = sum(1 for num in a_list if num % 2 == 0)\n   O_chest = len(a_list) - E_chest\n\n   E_key = sum(1 for num in b_list if num % 2 == 0)\n   O_key = len(b_list) - E_key\n\n   result = min(E_chest, O_key) + min(O_chest, E_key)\n\n   Print(result)\n\n However, wait: the condition is about the parity. Note that the condition is: \n        a_i + b_j is odd => (a_i % 2) != (b_j % 2)\n\n So even chest (a_i even) must use an odd key (b_j odd). Similarly, odd chest must use an even key.\n\n This matches.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number\", which is equivalent to having opposite parity.\n\n Thus, the solution is as above.\n\n Let me run the provided examples:\n\n Example: \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\"\n   a_list = [9,14,6,2,11] -> evens: [14,6,2] -> E_chest=3, O_chest=2\n   b_list = [8,4,7,20] -> evens: [8,4,20] (3), odds: [7] (1) -> E_key=3, O_key=1\n\n   result = min(3,1) + min(2,3) = 1 + 2 = 3 -> correct.\n\n Example: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n   a_list = [2,4,6,8,10] -> E_chest=5, O_chest=0\n   b_list = [5] -> E_key=0, O_key=1\n   result = min(5,1) + min(0,0) = 1 + 0 = 1 -> correct.\n\n Example: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n   a_list = [10] -> E_chest=1, O_chest=0\n   b_list = [20,30,40,50] -> E_key=4, O_key=0\n   result = min(1,0) + min(0,4) = 0 + 0 = 0 -> correct.\n\n Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem constraints are up to 10^5, so counting using a loop is O(n+m) which is acceptable.\n\n Code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key insight is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their numbers is odd, which means they must have opposite parity (one even and one odd). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests and keys such that each chest is opened by exactly one key, and each key is used at most once. The matching condition is based on the parity (even or odd) of the chest and key numbers.\n2. **Intuition**: Chests with even numbers need keys with odd numbers, and chests with odd numbers need keys with even numbers. The solution involves counting the number of even and odd chests and keys separately, then finding the maximum possible matches between them.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Count the number of even and odd numbers in the list of chests.\n   - Count the number of even and odd numbers in the list of keys.\n   - The maximum number of even chests that can be opened is the minimum of the count of even chests and the count of odd keys.\n   - The maximum number of odd chests that can be opened is the minimum of the count of odd chests and the count of even keys.\n   - The total number of chests that can be opened is the sum of these two maxima.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves two linear passes through the lists of chests and keys to count even and odd numbers, resulting in an O(n + m) time complexity, where n and m are the number of chests and keys, respectively. This is efficient given the constraints (up to 10^5 elements).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    a_list = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b_list = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    E_chest = sum(1 for num in a_list if num % 2 == 0)\n    O_chest = len(a_list) - E_chest\n    \n    E_key = sum(1 for num in b_list if num % 2 == 0)\n    O_key = len(b_list) - E_key\n    \n    result = min(E_chest, O_key) + min(O_chest, E_key)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective numbers.\n2. **Counting Parities**: The code counts how many chests and keys are even or odd by checking the remainder when divided by 2.\n3. **Calculating Matches**: The maximum number of even chests that can be opened is the lesser of the count of even chests and odd keys. Similarly, the maximum number of odd chests that can be opened is the lesser of the count of odd chests and even keys.\n4. **Output Result**: The sum of these two maxima gives the total number of chests that can be opened, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages parity checks to maximize the number of chests opened without exceeding the constraints of key usage.",
