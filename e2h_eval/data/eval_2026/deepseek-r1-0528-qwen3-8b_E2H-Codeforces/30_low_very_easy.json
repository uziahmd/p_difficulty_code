Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and a string A of 2n digits.\n We have two players: Homer (H) and Marge (M). Each makes exactly n moves.\n On each move, the leftmost digit is taken and appended to the respective player's number.\n\n The goal is to choose a sequence of moves (a string of length 2n containing n 'H's and n 'M's) such that the total prize (the sum of the two numbers S1 and S2) is maximized.\n\n Note: The game proceeds by removing the leftmost digit from A on each turn. The catch: we can decide arbitrarily which player takes the next digit (but each must take exactly n).\n\n However, note: the problem says \"each player should make exactly n moves\". So we have to assign exactly n moves to Homer and n to Marge.\n\n How do we think?\n Let's denote:\n   Let the entire process be represented by a string of moves (e.g., \"HHMM\" for n=2).\n\n The value for a player is the number formed by the digits they took in order.\n\n Example: \n   Input: n=2, A=\"1234\"\n\n   Possibilities for moves:\n\n   Option 1: \"HHMM\"\n      H takes first digit '1' -> S1 becomes \"1\", then second digit '2' -> S1 becomes \"12\"\n      Then M takes third digit '3' -> S2 becomes \"3\", then fourth digit '4' -> S2 becomes \"34\"\n      Total prize = 12 + 34 = 46\n\n   Option 2: \"HMHM\"\n      H: '1' -> then M: '2' -> then H: '3' -> then M: '4'\n      S1 = \"13\", S2 = \"24\", total = 13+24 = 37\n\n   Option 3: \"HM HM\" (same as above)\n\n   But wait, the example output for the input \"2\\n1234\" is \"HHMM\", and for \"2\\n9911\" is \"HMHM\".\n\n Why is \"HHMM\" better for \"1234\"? Because 12+34 is greater than 13+24? Actually, 12+34=46, 13+24=37, and also consider \"MMHH\":\n      M: '1', then M: '2', then H: '3', then H: '4' -> S1=34, S2=12 -> same as 12+34=46.\n\n However, note that the example input \"2\\n9911\" gives output \"HMHM\".\n\n Let's check:\n   A = \"9911\"\n\n   Option \"HMHM\":\n        H takes first '9' -> then M takes second '9' -> then H takes third '1' -> then M takes fourth '1'\n        S1 = \"91\", S2 = \"91\", total = 91+91 = 182.\n\n   What if we do \"HHMM\":\n        H: '9','9' -> S1 = \"99\"\n        M: '1','1' -> S2 = \"11\", total = 99+11 = 110.\n\n   Similarly, \"MMHH\": same as HHMM, 110.\n\n   And \"HM HM\" (same as HM repeated) is the only other one: \"HMMH\"?\n        Actually, we have to have two H and two M. The sequences are: \n          HHMM, HM HM (i.e., H then M then H then M) -> but wait, that is already considered as \"HMHM\" (which is different from \"HM MH\"?)\n        Actually, the distinct sequences are:\n          HHMM, HM HM (if we break into two moves: first H, then M, then H, then M) -> but that is \"HMHM\", and the other one is \"HMMH\" (if we do H, then two Ms then H) but that is not allowed because we need two Ms and two Hs.\n\n        Actually, the four sequences for n=2 are:\n          H H M M -> HHMM\n          H M H M -> HMHM\n          H M M H -> HMMH\n          M M H H -> MMHH\n          M H H M -> MHHM\n          M H M H -> MHMH\n\n        For A=\"9911\", let's check all:\n\n        HHMM: 99 + 11 = 110\n        HMHM: 99 (from first two: H takes first 9, then M takes second",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for two players, Homer and Marge, such that the sum of their resulting numbers is maximized. The game involves taking turns to pick digits from the leftmost end of a given 2n-digit number A, with each player making exactly n moves. The challenge is to decide the order of moves (Homer or Marge) to maximize the total prize, which is the sum of the numbers formed by each player.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the value of the numbers formed by each player depends on the order in which they pick digits. Since each player picks exactly n digits, the optimal strategy involves ensuring that higher-value digits are picked earlier by the player who can benefit most from them. However, because the digits are taken sequentially from the left, the decision at each step affects the subsequent digits available.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The optimal solution can be derived by comparing the digits in pairs. For each pair of digits (i-th and (i+n)-th digits in the original number), if the i-th digit is greater than the (i+n)-th digit, then Homer should pick the i-th digit first (as he gets to choose the higher digit earlier). Otherwise, Marge picks it. This greedy approach ensures that both players get the highest possible digits as early as possible, maximizing their respective numbers.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves iterating over the first half of the digits (since the second half mirrors the first in terms of pairing). For each digit in the first half, compare it with the corresponding digit in the second half. Based on this comparison, assign the move to either Homer or Marge. This method ensures that the sequence of moves is constructed optimally without needing complex computations or backtracking.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each digit in the first half of the number once, leading to a time complexity of O(n), which is efficient given the constraint n ≤ 18.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A = input().strip()\n    \n    s = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if A[i] > A[i + n]:\n            s.append('H')\n        else:\n            s.append('M')\n            \n    result = ''.join(s)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the integer `n` and the string `A` of 2n digits.\n2. **Constructing Moves**: For each position `i` in the first half of the string, the code compares the digit at position `i` with the digit at position `i + n`. If the former is greater, it appends 'H' to the result list; otherwise, it appends 'M'.\n3. **Output**: The constructed list of moves is joined into a string and printed. This string represents the sequence of moves that maximizes the total prize by ensuring higher digits are picked earlier by the respective player.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the optimal move sequence by leveraging a greedy strategy, ensuring both players' numbers are maximized with minimal computational overhead.",
