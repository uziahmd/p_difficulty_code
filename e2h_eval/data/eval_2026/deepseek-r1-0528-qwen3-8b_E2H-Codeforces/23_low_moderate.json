            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three tiles. Each tile is a string of two characters: first digit (from '1' to '9') and second character one of 'm', 'p', 's'.\n\n We can draw any number of tiles (each draw adds one tile). We want the minimum number of draws so that in the hand (original plus drawn) we have at least one mentsu (which is either a koutsu or a shuntsu).\n\n However, note: we only need at least one mentsu in the entire hand. The hand after drawing will have 3 + k tiles (k is the number of draws). But note: we don't necessarily need to form a mentsu with all the tiles? Actually, the problem says: \"she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand\". So we are allowed to have extra tiles.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If she already has a mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) then answer is 0.\n\n 2. Otherwise, we consider:\n\n    Option 1: Form a koutsu (triplet). We can complete a triplet by drawing up to 2 identical tiles (if we have one of the same tile). But note: we might have multiple copies of the same tile? Actually, the input has three tiles, but they can be duplicates.\n\n    However, note: the problem says \"she can draw any tiles\", and the tiles are represented as described.\n\n    Let's break down:\n\n    - Koutsu: three identical tiles (same number and same suit). \n\n        Example: ['1m', '1m', '1m'] -> already a koutsu.\n\n        How many draws needed for a koutsu?\n\n        Case 1: Already a koutsu: 0.\n\n        Case 2: Two of the same tile and one different: then we can draw one more of the same tile to complete the triplet. So 1 draw.\n\n        Case 3: One of the same tile and two different: then we need to draw two more of the same tile. So 2 draws.\n\n        Case 4: No duplicate: then we would need to draw two tiles (to get two more of one type, but note: we could also consider forming a triplet from scratch? Actually, we start with three distinct tiles. We can choose which tile to build a triplet on. However, we are allowed to draw any tile. So if we have one tile, say '1m', then we can draw two more '1m'. Similarly, if we have two different tiles, we can choose one of them to build a triplet (if we have two, then we just need one more; if we have one, then we need two more). But note: we have three tiles. They might not even be of the same suit.\n\n        Actually, for koutsu: the three tiles must be identical. So they must have the same number and same suit.\n\n        Therefore, we can only form a koutsu from a set of tiles that are all the same. So:\n\n        Let the hand be [t1, t2, t3]. We can count frequency per tile (each tile is defined by both number and suit). There are 27 possible tiles.\n\n        Let:\n          count_1 = number of tiles of a particular kind (say, '1m')\n          count_2 = number of another kind\n\n        But note: we are allowed to draw any tile. So we can choose which tile to build the triplet on.\n\n        Actually, we are not limited to building a triplet from the existing ones. We can choose any tile. However, we are trying to minimize the number of draws.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require that we use the existing tiles. However, we can only draw extra tiles. We have three tiles initially.\n\n        However, wait: the definition of koutsu requires three identical tiles. We can use the existing ones and then draw two more of the same. But we can also use three entirely new tiles? That would take 3 draws.\n\n        But we are trying to find the minimum draws.\n\n        So for koutsu:\n\n        - If there is already a tile that appears at least twice, then we can use that one and draw (3 - count) more of that tile.\n\n        But note: we can also consider using a tile that is not currently in the hand? Actually, no: because we are allowed to draw any tile, but we can also use the existing ones. However, we are not forced to use the existing ones. But why would we use a tile that isn't present? Because we are minimizing the total draws, and we have three tiles. We are going to form a triplet (three identical). We can do:\n\n        Option A: Use an existing tile that we have at least one of. Then we need to draw two",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) from her initial three tiles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, we check if the initial hand already contains a mentsu. A mentsu can be either:\n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles (same number and suit).\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive numbers in the same suit (e.g., [1m, 2m, 3m]).\n\n2. **Calculate Draws for Koutsu**: If no mentsu is found initially, calculate the draws needed to form a triplet. For each unique tile in the hand:\n   - If there are two identical tiles, drawing one more completes the triplet (1 draw).\n   - If there is one tile, drawing two more completes the triplet (2 draws).\n\n3. **Calculate Draws for Shuntsu**: To form a sequence, we need three consecutive numbers in the same suit. For each suit present in the hand:\n   - Identify possible sequences that include the existing tiles.\n   - Determine the missing tiles required to complete a sequence (if any).\n\n4. **Determine Minimum Draws**: Compare the number of draws needed for forming a koutsu or a shuntsu and choose the smaller value. The result is the minimum between these two values or zero if a mentsu already exists.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) != 3:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    tiles = [tile[:2] for tile in data]\n    \n    # Check for existing koutsu (triplet)\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    count_tile = defaultdict(int)\n    suits = set()\n    for t in tiles:\n        count_tile[t] += 1\n        suits.add(t[1])\n    \n    has_koutsu = False\n    for t, cnt in count_tile.items():\n        if cnt >= 3:\n            has_koutsu = True\n            break\n            \n    has_shuntsu = False\n    if not has_koutsu:\n        for suit in suits:\n            suit_tiles = [t for t in tiles if t[1] == suit]\n            numbers = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in suit_tiles])\n            seen = set()\n            for num in numbers:\n                if num in seen:\n                    continue\n                seq = []\n                current = num\n                while current <= num + 2 and current <= 9:\n                    if f\"{current}{suit}\" in count_tile:\n                        seq.append(f\"{current}{suit}\")\n                    current += 1\n                if len(seq) == 3:\n                    has_shuntsu = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(num)\n        else:\n            has_shuntsu = False\n\n    if has_koutsu or has_shuntsu:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Consider forming a triplet with one of the tiles\n    min_draws_koutsu = float('inf')\n    for t in count_tile:\n        cnt = count_tile[t]\n        if cnt == 3:\n            min_draws_koutsu = 0\n        elif cnt == 2:\n            min_draws_koutsu = min(min_draws_koutsu, 1)\n        elif cnt == 1:\n            min_draws_koutsu = min(min_draws_koutsu, 2)\n            \n    # Consider forming a sequence\n    min_draws_shuntsu = float('inf')\n    for suit in suits:\n        all_numbers = set(range(1, 10))\n        existing_numbers = set([int(t[0]) for t in tiles if t[1] == suit])\n        missing_numbers = all_numbers - existing_numbers\n        \n        for num in existing_numbers:\n            for start in range(max(1, num-2), num+1):\n                seq_nums = [start, start+1, start+2]\n                if max(seq_nums) > 9:\n                    continue\n                needed = []\n                for n in seq_nums:\n                    if n not in existing_numbers:\n                        needed.append(n)\n                if not needed:\n                    min_draws_shuntsu = 0\n                    break\n                else:\n                    if all(n in existing_numbers or n in missing_numbers for n in seq_nums):\n                        if len(needed) == 1:\n                            min_draws_shuntsu = min(min_draws_shuntsu, 1)\n                        elif len(needed) == 2:\n                            min_draws_shuntsu = min(min_draws_shuntsu, 2)\n                        elif len(needed) == 3:\n                            min_draws_shuntsu = min(min_draws_shuntsu, 3)\n            if min_draws_shuntsu == 0:\n                break\n        if min_draws_shuntsu == 0:\n            break\n\n    ans = min(min_draws_koutsu, min_draws_shuntsu) if min_draws_shuntsu != float('inf') else min_draws_koutsu\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check for Mentsu**: The code first checks if the hand already contains a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). If either is found, it immediately returns 0 as no draws are needed.\n2. **Triplet Calculation**: For forming a triplet, the code counts occurrences of each tile. If a tile appears twice, one more is needed (1 draw); if once, two more are needed (2 draws).\n3. **Sequence Calculation**: For sequences, the code checks each suit present in the hand. For each starting number, it checks if three consecutive numbers can be formed, calculating the missing numbers. The required draws are based on how many numbers are missing (1, 2, or 3 draws).\n4. **Result Determination**: The minimum draws required for either forming a triplet or a sequence is computed and printed. If no mentsu is possible, the solution defaults to the triplet requirement. \n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways to form a mentsu with minimal draws, ensuring optimal performance even for the maximum input size.",
