The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given n (number of rounds), string A (Nikephoros's sequence) and string B (Polycarpus's sequence)\n Since n can be up to 2e9, we cannot simulate round by round.\n Instead, we can use the concept of cycles.\n\n Let m = len(A), k = len(B). The sequences repeat every m and k rounds respectively.\n\n In one full cycle of both sequences (i.e., LCM(m, k) rounds), the outcomes will repeat.\n However, note that the two sequences have independent cycles. We can break down the game into:\n\n For a round i (0-indexed), Nikephororos uses A[i mod m], Polycarpus uses B[i mod k].\n\n We want to count:\n   red_spots_nike = number of rounds where Nikephoros loses (i.e., when Polycarpus wins)\n   red_spots_poly = number of rounds where Polycarpus loses (i.e., when Nikephoros wins)\n\n But note: in each round, if it's a draw, no one gets a spot.\n\n How to determine a round outcome?\n   Let x = A[i mod m], y = B[i mod k].\n   The rules:\n      Rock (R): beats Scissors (S)\n      Scissors (S): beats Paper (P)\n      Paper (P): beats Rock (R)\n\n   So, if x == y -> draw.\n\n   Otherwise:\n      If (x, y) is (R, S) -> then actually wait: \n          Actually, let's map:\n          - When does Nikephoros lose? \n            - If he plays R and Polycarpus plays P -> then R loses to P? No: actually:\n            Rules: \n              Rock (R) beats Scissors (S) -> so if Nikephoros plays R and Polycarpus plays S, then R wins (so Polycarpus loses).\n              Scissors (S) beats Paper (P) -> so if Nikephoros plays S and Polycarpus plays P, then S wins (so Polycarpus loses).\n              Paper (P) beats Rock (R) -> so if Nikephoros plays P and Polycarpus plays R, then P wins (so Polycarpus loses).\n\n          Therefore, for Nikephoros to lose (meaning Polycarpus wins), we need:\n            - If Nikephoros plays R: then Polycarpus must play P (because R loses to P)\n            - If Nikephoros plays S: then Polycarpus must play R (because S loses to R)\n            - If Nikephoros plays P: then Polycarpus must play S (because P loses to S)\n\n   Alternatively, we can define a function that returns:\n        0: draw\n        1: Nikephoros wins\n        -1: Polycarpus wins\n\n   But note: the problem counts the losses (which are the red spots). So:\n\n        If the round is a draw: no spot.\n        If Nikephoros loses (i.e., Polycarpus wins): then Nikephoros gets a spot.\n        If Polycarpus loses (i.e., Nikephoros wins): then Polycarpus gets a spot.\n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"the loser gets pinched\". So in a round:\n        If Nikephoros loses -> then Polycarpus wins, so Nikephoros gets a spot.\n        If Polycarpus loses -> then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot.\n\n   So we can define:\n\n        def outcome(x, y):\n            if x == y:\n                return 0   # draw\n            elif (x, y) == ('R', 'S'):\n                return 1   # actually wait, no: if (R, S): then R wins over S -> so Nik wins, so this is a win for Nik -> so Polycarpus loses -> so we count this as a spot for Polycarpus? \n            # Let me clarify:\n\n        Actually, let's write the condition for Polycarpus win:\n\n        Conditions for Polycarpus win (i.e., Nikephoros loses):\n\n            (x, y) = (R, P) -> because R loses to P -> so Polycarpus wins.\n            (x, y) = (S, R) -> because S loses to R -> Polycarpus wins.\n            (x, y) = (P, S) -> because P loses to S -> Polycarpus wins.\n\n        Conditions for Nikephoros win (i.e., Polycarpus loses):\n\n            (x, y) = (R, S) -> R beats S -> Nik wins.\n            (x, y) = (S",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The players follow a cyclic sequence of moves, and each round's outcome depends on their current moves. Given the constraints where `n` can be as large as 2·10^9, a brute-force simulation is infeasible. Instead, we leverage the periodic nature of the sequences to compute the results efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who use repeating sequences of moves (rock, paper, scissors). Each round's outcome is determined by comparing their current moves. The goal is to count how many times each player loses (i.e., receives a red spot) over `n` rounds without simulating each round individually.\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences repeat every `m` and `k` rounds for Nikephoros and Polycarpus, respectively. The combined cycle length is the least common multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k`. Within one LCM cycle, the outcomes repeat, allowing us to compute the total losses by analyzing a single cycle and then scaling up for the entire `n` rounds.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Cycle Detection**: Calculate the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the cycle length.\n   - **Cycle Simulation**: For each position within one cycle, compare the corresponding moves from both sequences and count the losses for each player.\n   - **Scaling**: Use integer division to determine how many full cycles fit into `n` rounds and multiply the cycle losses by this quotient. For any remaining rounds, simulate those rounds individually.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach efficiently handles large `n` by leveraging cycle properties. The complexity is dominated by the cycle length, which is at most 1,000,000 (since `m` and `k` are up to 1000), making it feasible even for very large `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data: \n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A = data[1].strip()\n    B = data[2].strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    total_rounds = n\n    cycle_length = m * k // math.gcd(m, k)\n    \n    full_cycles = total_rounds // cycle_length\n    remainder = total_rounds % cycle_length\n    \n    spots_nike = 0\n    spots_poly = 0\n    \n    for i in range(cycle_length):\n        idxA = (i // k) % m\n        idxB = i % k\n        x = A[idxA]\n        y = B[idxB]\n        \n        if x == y:\n            continue\n        elif (x, y) == ('R', 'S'):\n            spots_poly += 1\n        elif (x, y) == ('S', 'P'):\n            spots_poly += 1\n        elif (x, y) == ('P', 'R'):\n            spots_poly += 1\n        elif (x, y) == ('R', 'P'):\n            spots_nike += 1\n        elif (x, y) == ('S', 'R'):\n            spots_nike += 1\n        elif (x, y) == ('P', 'S'):\n            spots_nike += 1\n            \n    spots_nike_total = full_cycles * spots_nike + spots_nike_in_remainder(remainder, A, B)\n    spots_poly_total = full_cycles * spots_poly + spots_poly_in_remainder(remainder, A, B)\n    \n    print(f\"{spots_nike_total} {spots_poly_total}\")\n\ndef spots_nike_in_remainder(remainder, A, B):\n    if remainder == 0:\n        return 0\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        idxA = (i // k) % m\n        idxB = i % k\n        x = A[idxA]\n        y = B[idxB]\n        if (x, y) == ('R', 'P') or (x, y) == ('S', 'R') or (x, y) == ('P', 'S'):\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef spots_poly_in_remainder(remainder, A, B):\n    if remainder == 0:\n        return 0\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        idxA = (i // k) % m\n        idxB = i % k\n        x = A[idxA]\n        y = B[idxB]\n        if (x, y) == ('R', 'S') or (x, y) == ('S', 'P') or (x, y) == ('P', 'R'):\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences `A` and `B` for both players.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The LCM of the sequence lengths determines the cycle length, which helps in identifying repeating patterns.\n3. **Full Cycles Handling**: For each full cycle, the losses are counted once and multiplied by the number of full cycles in `n`.\n4. **Remaining Rounds**: Any remaining rounds after full cycles are processed individually to count additional losses.\n5. **Outcome Determination**: The outcome of each round is checked based on the game rules, and losses are incremented accordingly for each player.\n6. **Output**: The total losses for both players are printed after processing all rounds.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large values of `n` by leveraging cycle detection and scaling, ensuring optimal performance.",
