And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read the first line to get n and k.\n Then, read the next line which has n integers.\n\n There are (n - k + 1) weeks. Each week is k consecutive days.\n\n We need to compute the average sleep time over all weeks.\n\n However, note that the total sum of sleep over all weeks is not simply the same as:\n   total = (a1 + a2 + ... + an) * (k-1) / something? \n But wait, actually we can use a sliding window.\n\n Let S be the total sum for one week (the first week: days 0 to k-1). Then the next week is from day1 to dayk, etc.\n\n We can precompute the prefix sums to quickly get the sum for any consecutive k days.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read n, k and the list of sleep times.\n 2. Precompute prefix sum array `pref` such that:\n        pref[0] = 0\n        pref[i] = a0 + a1 + ... + a{i-1}\n\n    Then the sum of week starting at index i (from day i to i+k-1) is:\n        sum_i = pref[i+k] - pref[i]\n\n 3. The total sum over all weeks is the sum of `sum_i` for i from 0 to n-k.\n\n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    total_sum = 0\n    for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n        total_sum += (pref[i+k] - pref[i])\n\n 4. Then the average is total_sum / total_weeks\n\n However, note: n can be up to 200000 and k can be large too. But the above loop is O(n) which is acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the total_sum without a loop by:\n\n    total_sum = (pref[k] - pref[0]) + (pref[k+1] - pref[1]) + ... + (pref[n] - pref[n-k])\n\n But note that the prefix array is defined for indices 0..n.\n\n Actually, we can also think: each element a_i appears in how many weeks?\n    - The first element (index0) appears in the first k elements? Actually, from week0 to week (k-1) if any? \n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n    total_sum = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Count the frequency of a_i: \n        # It appears in the weeks that start from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k)\n        # Or simpler: the number of weeks that include a_i is (min(i+1, k, n-i, n-k+1))? Actually:\n\n        # Actually, the element at index i is included in the weeks that start from j such that j <= i and j >= i - k + 1, and j from 0 to n-k.\n        # So the condition: j <= i and j >= i - k + 1 and 0<=j<=n-k.\n        # The number of j is: min(i+1, n-k+1) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1? Actually, we can compute the count as:\n\n        # Let L = max(0, i - k + 1) and R = min(i, n-k) but wait, the week must start at j and j must be at least 0 and at most n-k, and also j <= i and j>= i-k+1.\n        # So the number of weeks that include a_i is: min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1? \n\n        # But note: the week starting at j covers indices [j, j+k-1]. So a_i is included if j <= i <= j+k-1 -> j <= i and j >= i - k + 1.\n\n        # The smallest j can be is 0, the largest j can be is n-k (so that the week ends at n-k + k -1 = n-1). And we require j<=i and j>=i-k+1, so the valid j's are from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k).\n\n        # So count_i = max(0, min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1) ?\n\n        # Then total_sum = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i * count_i\n\n    But note: the entire set of weeks is contiguous, so we can use the sliding window and prefix sum is easier.\n\n However, the problem says n can be up to 200000, and we can do two passes: one for prefix and then a single loop for the weeks.\n\n But note: if we do the direct summation with the sliding window, we have to consider that we are going to compute the sum for each week and then add them. That is O(n) because there are n-k+1 weeks and each week is computed in O(1) with the prefix array.\n\n Let's stick to the prefix sum method.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"3 2\" and [3,4,7]\n   Weeks: \n        week0: days0 to day1: [3,4] -> sum=7\n        week1: days1 to day2: [4,7] -> sum=11\n   total_sum = 7+11 = 18\n   total_weeks = 2\n   average = 18/2 = 9.0\n\n   Using prefix: \n        pref = [0, 3, 7, 14] (for indices 0,1,2,3)\n\n        week0: i=0 -> pref[0+2]-pref[0] = 7 - 0 = 7\n        week1: i=1 -> pref[1+2]-pref[1] = 14-3=11\n\n   This matches.\n\n However, note: the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"the answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6\"\n\n We can use floating point and format the output appropriately.\n\n But note: n and k are integers, and the sleep times are integers. The total_sum is an integer, and total_weeks is an integer (n-k+1). However, the division might not be exact.\n\n Steps:\n\n   n, k = map(int, input().split())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   # Build prefix sum array of length n+1\n   pref = [0]*(n+1)\n   for i in range(1, n+1):\n        pref[i] = pref[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n   total_weeks = n - k + 1\n   total_sum = 0\n   # We consider weeks from index0 to index n-k (each week starts at i from 0 to n-k)\n   for i in range(0, total_weeks):\n        total_sum += pref[i+k] - pref[i]\n\n   average = total_sum / total_weeks\n\n   Then we format the average to have 10 decimal places.\n\n However, note: we can avoid the loop by using a more efficient way? But the loop runs (n-k+1) times, which is about 200000, so it's acceptable.\n\n But wait, worst-case k=1: then total_weeks = n, and we do n iterations, which is 200000, which is acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the total_sum without the loop by:\n\n   total_sum = 0\n   for i in range(k): \n        # This is not straightforward.\n\n Actually, the total_sum can be written as:\n\n   total_sum = (pref[k] - pref[0]) + (pref[k+1]-pref[1]) + ... + (pref[n]-pref[n-k])\n\n But note: we can break down the prefix array:\n\n   total_sum = (pref[k] + pref[k+1] + ... + pref[n]) - (pref[0] + pref[1] + ... + pref[n-k])\n\n However, that is just a different way to write the same thing. But then we would have to compute two partial sums of the prefix array.\n\n Since the prefix array is already built, we can use the fact that the entire prefix array is known.\n\n But then we are still doing two loops: one to build the prefix and then one to compute the two partial sums? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the formula:\n\n   total_sum = (pref[k] + pref[k+1] + ... + pref[n]) - (pref[0] + pref[1] + ... + pref[n-k])\n\n But note: the prefix array is non-decreasing and we can compute the sum of a segment with another prefix? Actually, we can build a second prefix for the prefix array? \n\n However, this might be overkill. The original method with the loop is O(n) and acceptable.\n\n But let me check the constraints: n, k up to 200000. The loop runs n-k+1 times, which is about n (if k=1, then n times; if k=n, then 1 time). Worst-case n=200000, so 200000 iterations is acceptable in Python.\n\n However, we can also use a single pass to compute the total_sum without building the entire prefix array twice? \n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   total_sum = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        # Each a[i] appears in the windows that start from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k) ? \n\n   But then we would do:\n\n        count_i = min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1   [But wait, the condition is that the window must start at j, and j must be <= i and j>= i-k+1 and j<=n-k. So the valid j's are from L = max(0, i-k+1) to R = min(i, n-k). Then count_i = R - L + 1, provided that R>=L, otherwise 0.\n\n   Then total_sum = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a[i] * count_i\n\n   Example: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\n   i=0: L = max(0,0-2+1)=max(0,-1)=0; R=min(0,3-2)=min(0,1)=0 -> count0=0-0+1=1 -> 3*1=3\n   i=1: L = max(0,1-2+1)=max(0,0)=0; R=min(1,1)=1 -> count1=1-0+1=2 -> 4*2=8\n   i=2: L = max(0,2-2+1)=max(0,1)=1; R=min(2,1)=1 -> count2=1-1+1=1 -> 7*1=7\n\n   total_sum = 3+8+7 = 18, which is correct.\n\n   Then average = 18 / 2 = 9.\n\n   This method is also O(n). \n\n   Which one is better? The first method uses two arrays (one for prefix) and then a loop for the weeks, and the second method uses one array and then a loop for each element.\n\n   Actually, the first method requires building the prefix array and then a loop for the weeks (which is O(n)). The second method requires a loop for each element (O(n)) but without the prefix array.\n\n   However, note: the first method we built the prefix array and then did a loop for the weeks. The second method doesn't build the prefix array.\n\n   But wait, the second method: we need to compute for each i: \n        L = max(0, i-k+1)\n        R = min(i, n-k)\n\n   Then if R < L, then count_i=0, else count_i = R-L+1.\n\n   Then we do:\n\n        total_sum = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            L = max(0, i - k + 1)\n            R = min(i, n - k)\n            if R >= L:\n                count_i = R - L + 1\n            else:\n                count_i = 0\n            total_sum += a[i] * count_i\n\n   This is O(n) and simple.\n\n   But note: the two methods are both O(n). The first method is:\n\n        Build prefix: O(n)\n        Then loop for weeks: O(n) (because n-k+1 ~ n)\n\n   So both are O(n). \n\n   However, the first method is more straightforward and easier to understand.\n\n   But the problem says: n up to 200000. Both will run in acceptable time.\n\n   Let me choose the first method because the problem statement is about consecutive days and the first method is the standard sliding window.\n\n   However, note: the second method might be faster in practice because it avoids building an extra array and only does one pass.\n\n   But the first method is more common in problems like \"sum of all subarray sums\" or \"contribution technique\".\n\n   Since the problem is about consecutive days and we are summing over all consecutive k-day periods, the first method is natural.\n\n   But wait, what if k is very large? For example, k>n? No, because k<=n.\n\n   Let me write the first method.\n\n   Steps for first method:\n\n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        # Build prefix sum array of length n+1\n        pref = [0]*(n+1)\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            pref[i] = pref[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        total_sum = 0\n        # If there are no weeks, then total_weeks=0, but k<=n so total_weeks>=1.\n\n        for i in range(total_weeks):\n            # Each week starts at i, ends at i+k-1\n            total_sum += pref[i+k] - pref[i]\n\n        average = total_sum / total_weeks\n\n        # Format the output to have 10 decimal places.\n\n   However, note: we can use the second method to avoid building the prefix array. But the problem does not specify which is faster, and both are O(n). \n\n   But the second method might be faster because it avoids the extra memory for the prefix array and the inner operation is a simple arithmetic.\n\n   Let me test with n=200000 and k=100000.\n\n   First method: builds an array of 200001 integers and then does 200000 - 100000 + 1 = 100001 iterations.\n\n   Second method: does one pass of 200000, and for each i does two min/max operations.\n\n   I think the second method is simpler and avoids building an extra array.\n\n   But wait, the first method is the standard way to do sliding window. The second method is the contribution method.\n\n   However, the problem statement says: \"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is 9.0\"\n\n   Both methods work.\n\n   But note: the second method may have off-by-one errors.\n\n   Let me reexamine the second method:\n\n        Condition: the element a[i] is included in a week if the week starts at j and j is in [max(0, i-k+1), min(i, n-k)]\n\n        Why min(i, n-k)? Because the week must start at j and the last week starts at n-k (so that the week covers up to n-k+k-1 = n-1). Also, j must be at most i (so that the week includes i) and at least i-k+1 (so that the week ends at j+k-1 >= i).\n\n        The week starting at j includes indices from j to j+k-1. We require j<=i<=j+k-1.\n\n        From j<=i and j>= i-k+1, and j must be between 0 and n-k (inclusive). \n\n        So the lower bound for j is L = max(0, i-k+1)\n        The upper bound for j is R = min(i, n-k)   [because j<=i and j<=n-k]\n\n        Then the number of j's is R-L+1 (if R>=L).\n\n   Example: n=3, k=2, i=0: \n        L = max(0,0-2+1)=max(0,-1)=0\n        R = min(0, 3-2)=min(0,1)=0 -> count=1, which is correct.\n\n   Example: i=1: \n        L = max(0,1-2+1)=max(0,0)=0\n        R = min(1,1)=1 -> count=2, correct.\n\n   Example: i=2:\n        L = max(0,2-2+1)=max(0,1)=1\n        R = min(2,1)=1 -> count=1, correct.\n\n   Now, test with k=3, n=3, then total_weeks=1, and the week is the entire array.\n\n        i=0: L = max(0,0-3+1)=max(0,-2)=0, R=min(0,3-3)=min(0,0)=0 -> count=1\n        i=1: L = max(0,1-3+1)=max(0,-1)=0, R=min(1,0)=0 -> count=0 (since 0>=0 -> 0-0+1=1? but wait, 0 is the lower bound, and R=0, so 0-0+1=1, but then the week starting at 0 includes day1 (index1)? \n        Actually, the week starting at 0: covers [0,1,2] -> yes, day1 is included.\n\n        Correction: for i=1, the week starting at 0: j=0, then the week includes indices 0,1,2. So i=1 is included.\n\n        But wait, our condition: j must be <= i (0<=1) and j>= i-k+1 -> 0>=1-3+1 -> 0>=-1 -> true. So j=0 is the only one. Therefore, count=1.\n\n        But our calculation: R = min(1, n-k)=min(1,0)=0, then L=0, then count=0-0+1=1. Correct.\n\n        Now, i=2: \n            L = max(0,2-3+1)=max(0,0)=0\n            R = min(2,0)=0\n            count=0-0+1=1, correct.\n\n   Another test: n=5, k=3, then total_weeks=3. \n        Week0: [0,1,2]\n        Week1: [1,2,3]\n        Week2: [2,3,4]\n\n        How many times does a[0] appear? Only in week0 -> count0=1.\n        a[1]: in week0 and week1 -> count1=2.\n        a[2]: in week0, week1, week2 -> count2=3.\n        a[3]: in week1, week2 -> count3=2.\n        a[4]: in week2 -> count4=1.\n\n        Using the formula:\n          i=0: L=max(0,0-3+1)=0, R=min(0,5-3)=min(0,2)=0 -> count0=1.\n          i=1: L=max(0,1-3+1)=0, R=min(1,2)=1 -> count1=1-0+1=2.\n          i=2: L=max(0,2-3+1)=0, R=min(2,2)=2 -> count2=2-0+1=3.\n          i=3: L=max(0,3-3+1)=1, R=min(3,2)=2 -> count3=2-1+1=2.\n          i=4: L=max(0,4-3+1)=2, R=min(4,2)=2 -> count4=2-2+1=1.\n\n        Correct.\n\n   So the second method works.\n\n   But note: the first method is also correct and standard. We can choose either.\n\n   Since the problem is straightforward and both are O(n), we can use the second method to save memory (avoid building the prefix array) and maybe speed.\n\n   However, the problem constraints say n up to 200000, so even the first method's extra array is 200001 integers, which is about 1.6 MB (since each integer in Python might be 8 bytes? 200000*8 = 1.6e6 bytes, which is acceptable).\n\n   Let me choose the first method for clarity.\n\n   But wait, the problem asks for average sleep time over all weeks. We can also use the second method to avoid the extra array.\n\n   I'll use the second method for efficiency and simplicity.\n\n   Code for second method:\n\n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        total_sum = 0\n\n        # If there are no weeks, then skip. But k<=n so total_weeks>=1.\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Determine the range of weeks that include the i-th element.\n            low_j = max(0, i - k + 1)\n            high_j = min(i, n - k)   # because the week must end by n-1, so the start j must be <= n-k\n\n            if high_j >= low_j:\n                count_i = high_j - low_j + 1\n            else:\n                count_i = 0\n\n            total_sum += a[i] * count_i\n\n        average = total_sum / total_weeks\n\n        # Format the output to have 10 digits after the decimal point.\n\n   However, note: the second method might be less obvious to some readers.\n\n   After reading the problem statement again, note that the example output is given with 10 decimal places.\n\n   We can format the output as:\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n   But note: the average might be integer, then we want trailing zeros.\n\n   Example: 9.0 should be printed as '9.0000000000'\n\n   Let me test with the examples.\n\n   Example1: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7] -> average=9.0 -> formatted as '9.0000000000'\n\n   Example2: n=1, k=1, a=[10] -> total_weeks=1, total_sum=10, average=10.0 -> formatted as '10.0000000000'\n\n   Example3: n=8, k=2, a=[1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1] -> 7 weeks.\n\n        We can calculate manually: \n            Week0: 1+2 = 3\n            Week1: 2+4 = 6\n            Week2: 4+100000 = 100004\n            Week3: 100000+123 = 100123\n            Week4: 123+456 = 579\n            Week5: 456+789 = 1245\n            Week6: 789+1 = 790\n\n        Total_sum = 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = \n        Let me compute: \n            3+6=9\n            9+100004=100013\n            100013+100123=200136\n            200136+579=200715\n            200715+1245=201960\n            201960+790=202750\n\n        average = 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n        The example output is '28964.2857142857'\n\n   Now, let me compute with the second method:\n\n        n=8, k=2\n        For i=0: \n            low_j = max(0,0-2+1)=0, high_j=min(0,8-2)=min(0,6)=0 -> count0=1 -> 1*1=1\n        i=1: \n            low_j = max(0,1-2+1)=0, high_j=min(1,6)=1 -> count1=2 -> 2*2=4\n        i=2:\n            low_j = max(0,2-2+1)=1, high_j=min(2,6)=2 -> count2=2 -> 4*2=8\n        i=3:\n            low_j = max(0,3-2+1)=2, high_j=min(3,6)=3 -> count3=2 -> 100000*2=200000\n        i=4:\n            low_j = max(0,4-2+1)=3, high_j=min(4,6)=4 -> count4=2 -> 123*2=246\n        i=5:\n            low_j = max(0,5-2+1)=4, high_j=min(5,6)=5 -> count5=2 -> 456*2=912\n        i=6:\n            low_j = max(0,6-2+1)=5, high_j=min(6,6)=6 -> count6=2 -> 789*2=1578\n        i=7:\n            low_j = max(0,7-2+1)=6, high_j=min(7,6)=6 -> count7=1 -> 1*1=1\n\n        total_sum = 1+4+8+200000+246+912+1578+1 = \n        1+4=5, 5+8=13, 13+200000=200013, 200013+246=200259, 200259+912=201171, 201171+1578=202749, 202749+1=202750.\n\n        Correct.\n\n   So the second method is correct.\n\n   We'll use the second method.\n\n   However, note: the second method uses integer arithmetic and then a floating point division. This is safe because the numbers are integers and the division is by an integer (total_weeks) and the result is a float.\n\n   Finally, we output the average with 10 decimal places.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the answer must be correct within absolute or relative error 1e-6. Using floating point with 10 digits is safe.\n\n   However, note: the total_sum is an integer and total_weeks is an integer, so the division is exact if we use fractions, but we are using floating point. But the numbers are integers and the division is by an integer, so the result might not be representable exactly in floating point if the numbers are very large? \n\n   But note: the maximum value of total_sum: \n        n <= 200000, ai <= 100000, so maximum total_sum is 200000 * 100000 * (at most) 200000? Actually, no, because each element appears at most (k) times? Actually, the maximum count for an element is k (if k<=n). But k<=n, and the maximum k is 200000, and the maximum ai is 100000, so maximum total_sum is 200000 * 100000 * 200000 = 4e15, which is an integer that Python can handle, but when we divide by total_weeks (which is at least 1 and at most 200000) we get a float that might have rounding errors.\n\n   However, the problem requires absolute or relative error <= 1e-6. Floating point double precision (Python float) has about 15-17 significant digits, so for numbers around 4e15, the absolute error in representing the integer is negligible, and the division by an integer (which is exact in mathematical terms) but represented as a float, the error should be within 1e-6.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        average = total_sum / total_weeks\n\n   and then format to 10 decimal places.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point\", so 10 is more than enough.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        total_sum = 0\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            low_j = max(0, i - k + 1)\n            high_j = min(i, n - k)\n            if high_j >= low_j:\n                total_sum += a[i] * (high_j - low_j + 1)\n\n        average = total_sum / total_weeks\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n   Let me test with the examples.\n\n   Example1: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7] -> average=9.0 -> \"9.0000000000\"\n\n   Example2: n=1, k=1, a=[10] -> total_weeks=1, total_sum=10 -> \"10.0000000000\"\n\n   Example3: n=8, k=2, a=[1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1] -> average=202750/7 -> 28964.2857142857... -> \"28964.2857142857\"\n\n   But wait, the example output is '28964.2857142857' (without rounding). \n\n   However, note: 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857142857... so the 10th decimal is 2857142857... so the formatting will show 10 digits.\n\n   But note: the formatting rounds to the 10th decimal. \n\n   The specification says: absolute or relative error <= 1e-6. Our calculation is exact (we are using integer arithmetic for total_sum) and then converting to float for division. Then we format to 10 decimal places, which is more than enough.\n\n   However, due to floating point precision, we might see a small error for very large numbers. But the problem constraints say ai up to 10^5 and n up to 200000, so the maximum total_sum is at most 200000 * 100000 * 200000 = 4e15, which is within the exact representation of integers in Python (which are arbitrary precision) and the division by total_weeks (an integer) is an integer division? Actually, no, it's a floating point division.\n\n   But note: the problem allows an absolute or relative error of 1e-6. \n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        average = total_sum / total_weeks\n\n   and then use formatting. \n\n   Since the numbers are integers and the denominator is an integer, we can use:\n\n        average = total_sum / total_weeks\n\n   and then format to 10 decimal places.\n\n   This should be acceptable.\n\n   Let me run the third example: 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857142857\n\n   Formatting: {:.10f} -> rounds to 10 decimal places.\n\n   The 10th decimal is the 10th digit: \n        28964.2857142857 -> the 10th digit is the 7 (after the decimal: 2 8 5 7 1 4 2 8 5 7)\n\n   But wait, let me count: \n        .2 8 5 7 1 4 2 8 5 7 -> that's 10 digits.\n\n   The example output is '28964.2857142857'\n\n   So it matches.\n\n   However, note: the example output in the problem is given as:\n\n        ['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n   So we output exactly as required.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        total_sum = 0\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            low_j = max(0, i - k + 1)\n            high_j = min(i, n - k)\n            if high_j >= low_j:\n                count_i = high_j - low_j + 1\n            else:\n                count_i = 0\n            total_sum += a[i] * count_i\n\n        average = total_sum / total_weeks\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n   But note: the problem input might have multiple lines? The example input is given as:\n\n        ['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n   This is a list of strings. But we are reading from stdin.\n\n   We assume the input is provided via standard input.\n\n   Let me run the code on the provided examples.\n\n   Example1: \n        Input: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\"\n        Output: \"9.0000000000\"\n\n   Example2: \n        Input: \"1 1\\n10\"\n        Output: \"10.0000000000\"\n\n   Example3: \n        Input: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n        Output: \"28964.2857142857\"\n\n   But wait, the example output for example3 is exactly as the example.\n\n   However, note: the example output string is '28964.2857142857', but when we format 202750/7 to 10 decimal places, we get:\n\n        >>> 202750 / 7\n        28964.285714285714\n        >>> \"{:.10f}\".format(28964.285714285714)\n        '28964.2857142857'\n\n   But note: the formatting rounds to the nearest 10th decimal.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time of Polycarp over all possible weeks in the given sequence of sleep records. A week is defined as k consecutive days, and there are (n - k + 1) such weeks in the sequence. The solution involves efficiently summing the sleep times for all weeks and then computing the average.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires calculating the average sleep time over all possible consecutive k-day periods (weeks) in a sequence of n days. Each day's sleep time is given, and we need to consider every possible k consecutive days as a week.\n2. **Intuition**: For each element in the sequence, determine how many weeks include that element. The number of weeks an element appears in can be derived by considering the valid starting indices of the weeks that include the element. Specifically, for an element at position i, the valid starting indices j of the week must satisfy j ≤ i ≤ j + k - 1, and j must be between 0 and n - k (inclusive).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Instead of recalculating the sum for each week from scratch, we use a mathematical approach to compute the total sum of all weeks by leveraging the fact that each element's contribution to the total sum is proportional to the number of weeks it appears in. This avoids the need for nested loops and reduces the complexity to O(n).\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each element once, performing constant-time operations for each. Thus, the time complexity is O(n), which is optimal for the given constraints (n ≤ 2·10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    total_sum = 0\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        low_j = max(0, i - k + 1)\n        high_j = min(i, n - k)\n        if high_j >= low_j:\n            count_i = high_j - low_j + 1\n        else:\n            count_i = 0\n        total_sum += a[i] * count_i\n\n    average = total_sum / total_weeks\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of days (n), the length of each week (k), and the sequence of sleep times for each day.\n2. **Initial Setup**: The total number of weeks is calculated as `n - k + 1`. The variable `total_sum` is initialized to accumulate the sum of sleep times across all weeks.\n3. **Element Contribution Calculation**: For each day `i`, the algorithm calculates the range of valid starting indices (`low_j` and `high_j`) for weeks that include day `i`. The number of such weeks is `count_i`, which is the difference between `high_j` and `low_j` plus one, provided `high_j` is not less than `low_j`.\n4. **Summing Contributions**: The sleep time of day `i` is multiplied by `count_i` and added to `total_sum`.\n5. **Average Calculation**: The average sleep time is computed by dividing `total_sum` by the number of weeks (`total_weeks`), ensuring the result is formatted to 10 decimal places for precision.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average by leveraging mathematical insights to avoid redundant calculations, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
