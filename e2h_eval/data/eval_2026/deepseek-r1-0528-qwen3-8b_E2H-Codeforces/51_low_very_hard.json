Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from standard input.\n The idea is:\n 1. Combine the first two strings (guest name and host name) and count the total frequency of each letter.\n 2. Compare the frequency of letters in the third string (the pile) with the combined frequency of the first two.\n 3. If the two frequencies match exactly (same letters and same counts), then output \"YES\", otherwise \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the problem says that the pile should be exactly the letters from the two names (without extra or missing).\n\n Steps:\n - Read the three lines, strip the newlines.\n - Concatenate the first two lines to form a combined string.\n - Count the frequency of each character in the combined string and in the third string.\n - Compare the two frequency counts.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Combined string: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n   Pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   But note: the example input in the problem is given as a list of strings for multiple examples. However, the problem states that we read three lines.\n\n Let's break down the example:\n\n   Example 1:\n     Guest: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n     Host: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n     Pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Actually, the example input provided in the problem is:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   But wait, the sample input is given as three separate lines.\n\n   However, the example input in the problem statement is:\n\n        Input: \n          ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   This seems to be a representation of multiple test cases? But the problem says the input consists of three lines.\n\n   Clarification: The problem says the input file consists of three lines.\n\n   Therefore, we assume one test case per run.\n\n   However, the example output is a list of answers: ['YES', 'NO', 'NO'].\n\n   So actually, the problem might be giving an example with three test cases? But the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\".\n\n   Wait, let me check the example again: \n\n        Input: \n          ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   This is confusing because the example input is represented as a list of three strings, but the problem says three lines.\n\n   Actually, looking at the example: \n\n        Example Input:\n          Line1: 'SANTACLAUS'\n          Line2: 'DEDMOROZ'\n          Line3: 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\n   Then the next example is:\n\n          Line1: 'PAPAINOEL'\n          Line2: 'JOULUPUKKI'\n          Line3: 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI'\n\n   And the third example:\n\n          Line1: 'BABBONATALE'\n          Line2: 'FATHERCHRISTMAS'\n          Line3: 'BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER'\n\n   But the example output is ['YES','NO','NO'] meaning three separate test cases?\n\n   However, the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n   This implies that there is only one test case per input file.\n\n   But wait, the example input is shown as having three lines for one test case and then the output is one letter. Then why is the example output a list of three?\n\n   Let me read the problem statement again: \n\n        The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n        # Amusing Joke\n\n        [Problem description]\n\n        Example\n        ### Input\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n        ### Output\n        ['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n   This example input is actually showing three different inputs (each being three lines) and the expected outputs for each.\n\n   But the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n   So, we must assume that we are given one test case per execution.\n\n   However, if we are to",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves comparing the frequency of each letter in the combined names with the frequency of letters in the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Inputs**: The first two lines are the guest's name and the host's name, respectively. The third line is the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Count Letters**: For both the combined names and the pile, count the occurrences of each letter.\n4. **Compare Counts**: If the counts of each letter in the combined names match exactly those in the pile, output \"YES\". Otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match of letters required to form both names without any extra or missing letters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    guest = input().strip()\n    host = input().strip()\n    pile = input().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    combined_counter = Counter(combined)\n    pile_counter = Counter(pile)\n    \n    print(\"YES\" if combined_counter == pile_counter else \"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Inputs**: The program reads three lines from standard input: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's name and host's name are concatenated into a single string to represent all required letters.\n3. **Counting Letters**: Using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, the program counts the occurrences of each letter in both the combined names and the pile.\n4. **Comparison**: The program checks if the letter counts from the combined names match those from the pile. If they match exactly, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis solution efficiently verifies the feasibility of reconstructing the original names from the given pile of letters by leveraging simple counting and comparison.",
