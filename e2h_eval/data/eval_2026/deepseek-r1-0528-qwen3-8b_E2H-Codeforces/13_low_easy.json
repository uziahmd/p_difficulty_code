For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes. The notes are from the set: ['C','C#','D','D#','E','F','F#','G','G#','A','B','H'] (12 notes)\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (0 to 11) representing the semitone index.\n 2. Since the chord is an unordered set, we will consider all permutations of the three notes.\n 3. For each permutation [a, b, c] (which we can think as X, Y, Z), check two conditions:\n    Condition for major: \n        distance from a to b = 4 semitones, and from b to c = 3 semitones.\n    Condition for minor:\n        distance from a to b = 3 semitones, and from b to c = 4 semitones.\n\n However, note: the problem says the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the highest one. But in our circular system, we need to compute the distance in a circular way.\n\n Important: In music, when we say the distance from note A to note B, we can go two ways: \n    The direct distance (if we go forward from A to B) or backward? But the problem states: \"the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\".\n\n Actually, we are told that the distance is taken from the lowest to the highest. So we must consider the circular arrangement and then take the minimal positive direction?\n\n But note: the example: \"between E and C is 8 semitones\". Since there are 12 semitones, the other way from E to C is 4 semitones (if we go backwards) but the problem defines the distance from E to C as 8 (because they are going from E to C and considering the upward direction? Actually, the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". \n\n However, the chord definition requires ordering the notes so that the distances are 4 and then 3 (for major) or 3 and then 4 (for minor). The ordering must be such that we are moving in increasing order (without wrapping around in the middle). \n\n But note: the example \"C# B F\": \n    They are ordered as \"B\", \"C#\", \"F\". \n    Let's map: \n        B -> 10, C# -> 1, F -> 5.\n\n    How do we compute the distance from B to C#? \n        In the circle: \n            ... B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F ...\n        From B (10) to C# (1): \n            If we go forward: from 10 to 11 (C) then to 0 (C?) wait, no. Actually, we have 12 notes: \n            Let's assign numbers: \n                C:0, C#:1, D:2, D#:3, E:4, F:5, F#:6, G:7, G#:8, A:9, B:10, H:11.\n\n        Then the circle: after B (10) comes C (0) which is actually the same as 12+0. \n\n        The distance from B (10) to C# (1) in the forward direction (without wrapping) would be (1 - 10) mod 12? But that gives negative. \n\n        Alternatively, we can define the distance from note i to note j (in the forward direction, meaning from lower to higher without crossing 12) as:\n            d = (j - i) % 12\n            But if j < i, then (j - i) % 12 = j-i+12, so we get the forward distance.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\". \n            E is 4, C is 0. Then (0 - 4) % 12 = -4 % 12 = 8. That matches.\n\n        So the forward distance from note a to note b (in the circle) is (b - a) % 12, but if negative we add 12 to make it positive modulo.\n\n        Actually, we can use: \n            distance = (b - a) % 12\n            But if negative, we can adjust by: \n            distance = (b - a) % 12\n            However, the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers: (b - a) % 12 might not give the minimal positive distance if we want the forward direction without wrapping? \n\n        But note: the problem says the distance from E to C is 8",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for a major or minor chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Mapping**: Convert each note into a numerical value (0 to 11) based on its position in the chromatic scale. For example, 'C' is 0, 'C#' is 1, up to 'H' which is 11.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For any two notes, the distance between them is calculated as `(b - a) % 12`. This handles the circular nature of the musical scale, ensuring distances wrap around correctly (e.g., from 'E' (4) to 'C' (0) is 8 semitones).\n3. **Chord Check**: For each permutation of the three notes, check if the distances between consecutive notes match the criteria for a major chord (4 semitones followed by 3 semitones) or a minor chord (3 semitones followed by 4 semitones). If any permutation matches either criterion, classify the chord accordingly. If no permutation matches, classify it as \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    input_str = input().split()\n    note_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes)}\n    \n    indices = [note_to_index[note] for note in input_str]\n    \n    def get_distance(a, b):\n        return (b - a) % 12\n    \n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(indices):\n        a, b, c = perm\n        d1 = get_distance(a, b)\n        d2 = get_distance(b, c)\n        d3 = get_distance(c, a)\n        \n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3 and d3 == 9:\n            found_major = True\n            \n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4 and d3 == 9:\n            found_minor = True\n    \n    if found_major and not found_minor:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor and not found_major:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The code starts by mapping each note to its corresponding index in the chromatic scale (0 to 11). This allows us to work with numerical values instead of string representations.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The `get_distance` function computes the forward distance between two notes in the musical scale, accounting for the circular nature of the scale using modulo arithmetic.\n3. **Chord Check**: The code checks all permutations of the three input notes to see if any ordering satisfies the major or minor chord conditions. For a major chord, the distances should be 4 semitones followed by 3 semitones (and the third distance will automatically be 9 semitones due to the sum of intervals in a triad). Similarly, a minor chord requires 3 semitones followed by 4 semitones.\n4. **Output**: Based on whether a major or minor chord condition is met (and not the other), the code outputs the appropriate result. If neither condition is met, it outputs \"strange\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible orderings of the three notes to determine the chord type, leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular musical scale.",
