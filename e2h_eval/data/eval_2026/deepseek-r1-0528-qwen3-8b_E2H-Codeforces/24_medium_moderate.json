She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n The idea is to consider that we only need to leave the tabs from l to r. The cursor starts at 'pos'. We can move the cursor (with constraints) and close tabs to the left or right.\n\n However, note that the problem allows two types of operations per second:\n  1. Move the cursor one step to the left or right (but constrained by the current minimum and maximum index of unclosed tabs)\n  2. Close all tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor.\n\n But note: when we close tabs, the boundaries (a and b) change. However, we can think of the process as:\n\n We must close all tabs outside [l, r]. This means we have two sides to worry about:\n  - The left side: if there are tabs to the left of l that are still open, then we must close them.\n  - The right side: if there are tabs to the right of r that are still open, then we must close them.\n\n But note: initially, all tabs are open. So we must remove all tabs with index < l and all tabs with index > r.\n\n The operations allowed are:\n  - Move the cursor one step at a time (but the movement is limited by the current boundaries of the remaining tabs).\n  - Close either the entire left part (from the current boundary to i-1) or the entire right part (from i+1 to the current boundary).\n\n Observation: We can break the problem into two parts: closing the left part (if necessary) and the right part (if necessary). However, note that sometimes we can do both in an optimized way.\n\n However, note that the example: \n   Input: \"6 3 2 4\" -> Output: 5\n\n Steps in the example:\n   Start: n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n   We need to leave tabs 2,3,4. So we must close tabs 1 and 5,6.\n\n   Steps:\n     1. Move cursor from 3 to 2 (1 second): now cursor is at 2.\n     2. Close left (tabs [a, 1] where a was initially 1, but after closing left? Actually, after closing left, the leftmost tab becomes 2. But note: the operation \"close left\" closes all tabs to the left of the cursor (which is 2). So after closing, the left boundary becomes 2. Then we have tabs 2,3,4,5,6? Actually, no: we close the left part, so we remove all tabs with indices less than 2. Now the tabs are from 2 to 6. But wait, we also have to close the right part. Then:\n     3. Move cursor from 2 to 3 (1 second) and then from 3 to 4 (another second) -> total 3 seconds so far, then\n     4. Close the right part (from 4 to the current boundary which is 6) so we remove tabs 5,6. Then we are done.\n\n     Total seconds: 1 (move to 2) + 1 (close left) + 2 (move from 2 to 4) + 1 (close right) = 5.\n\n Alternatively, we might consider:\n\n   Option 1: Close the left part first, then the right part.\n\n   Steps for Option 1:\n     1. Move to l (if needed) and close left.\n     2. Then move to r (if needed) and close right.\n\n   But note: after closing left, the set of tabs changes and the cursor must be in the remaining segment [l, ...] to then close the right.\n\n   However, we can also consider:\n\n   Option 2: Maybe close the right part first, then the left part.\n\n   Option 3: Maybe we don't necessarily have to move to the very edge (l or r) before closing the adjacent side? Actually, the operation \"close left\" requires being at a tab such that the left part is to be closed. Similarly for right.\n\n   Conditions for closing left: the cursor must be at a tab i such that the left part (from the current left boundary to i-1) is to be closed. But note that the left boundary is the smallest index currently open. Initially, the left boundary is 1. After closing some left tabs, the left boundary becomes the next available tab. However, the operation \"close left\" doesn't require the cursor to be at the very left of the segment to be closed. It just requires that we are at a tab i, and then we close all tabs from the current left boundary to i-1.\n\n   Therefore, to close the left part (all tabs < l), we must have the cursor at a tab that is at least l (so that the left boundary is at least l, and then we close from the current left boundary to i-1). But wait: actually, we can close the left part from any position as long as the left part to be closed is from the current left boundary to i-1. However, we want to close only the left part that is not in [l, r]. So the left part to close is [current_left, l-1] (if current_left <= l-1). But initially, current_left is 1.\n\n   Therefore, to close the left part, we must be at a tab i such that i >= l (so that we can close from the current left boundary to i-1, and we want to cover up to l-1). But note: we can also close more than necessary? However, we cannot close beyond the desired segment because the problem says we must leave exactly [l, r]. So we have to ensure that we don't close any tab in [l, r].\n\n   Actually, the operation \"close left\" closes from the current left boundary (which is the smallest index of an open tab) to i-1. Initially, the left boundary is 1. After closing, the left boundary becomes i (since we remove everything from 1 to i-1). But note: if we are at a tab i (which is >= l) and we close the left, then we remove all tabs from 1 to i-1. However, if i-1 >= l, then we are removing some part of [l, r]? That's bad.\n\n   Therefore, to safely close the left part without affecting [l, r], we must have i == l. Because then we close from 1 to l-1 (if the current left boundary is 1). Similarly, for the right part, we must be at i == r.\n\n   So the plan is:\n\n   Case 1: If the entire range [l, r] is already the set of open tabs (i.e., no tabs to close), then answer 0.\n\n   Otherwise, we have two sides to close: left and/or right.\n\n   Let:\n      left_side = (l > 1)   # meaning we need to close tabs from 1 to l-1\n      right_side = (r < n)   # meaning we need to close tabs from r+1 to n\n\n   Now, if both left_side and right_side are true, then we must close both. But note: we can choose the order.\n\n   Consider:\n\n   Option A: Close left first, then right.\n        Steps for left: \n            - We need to move from the current cursor (pos) to l (because we must be at l to close the left without affecting [l, r]).\n            - Then close left (1 second).\n            - Then move from l to r (if we are at l, we can move to r by moving right (r-l steps) and then close right (if we are at r, then close right).\n        Total: |pos - l| (to get to l) + 1 (close left) + (r - l) (to get to r) + 1 (close right) = |pos-l| + (r-l) + 2.\n\n   Option B: Close right first, then left.\n        Steps for right:\n            - Move from pos to r: |pos - r| seconds.\n            - Close right: 1 second.\n            - Then move from r to l: (r - l) seconds (if we go from r to l, we are moving left, so |r-l| steps) and then close left: 1 second.\n        Total: |pos - r| + (r-l) + 2.\n\n   But wait, what if we are already in the segment [l, r]? Then we don't need to move to l or r necessarily? Actually, we have to be at l to close left and at r to close right.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not require that we do the closing operations only once. But we must close the entire left part and the entire right part.\n\n   But there's another possibility: what if we can combine the movements? For example, if we are between l and r, we can do:\n\n        Option C: Maybe we can close one side without going all the way to the edge? Actually, no: because to close the left part we must be at l (so that we don't close any part of [l, r]). Similarly for the right.\n\n   However, what if we don't have to go to the very edge? Actually, the operation \"close left\" will close all tabs from the current left boundary to the cursor's left. To avoid closing any tab in [l, r], we must have the cursor at l (so that the left part we close is [current_left, l-1]). Similarly for the right.\n\n   But note: the current_left might change during the process. Initially, current_left is 1, and current_right is n. After closing left, current_left becomes l (because we are closing from 1 to l-1, and then the next open tab is l). Then to close the right, we must be at r (so that we close from current_right (which is n) to r+1, but wait: after closing left, the current_right is still n because we haven't touched the right part. However, we must note that the problem says the boundaries are the min and max of the unclosed tabs.\n\n   Actually, after closing left, the set of tabs is [l, n]. Then to close the right, we must close from the current_right (n) down to r+1, and we must be at r. But wait: if we are at r, then we can close the right (from r+1 to n). And the movement from l to r is (r-l) steps.\n\n   Similarly, if we close right first, the set of tabs becomes [1, r] and then we must be at l to close the left.\n\n   However, what if we are already at l and we need to close the right? Then we just have to move from l to r (r-l steps) and then close the right. Similarly, if we are already at r and we need to close the left, we move from r to l (which is (r-l) steps? Actually, from r to l is (r-l) steps to the left? But note: moving from r to l is (r-l) steps? Actually, the number of steps to move from a to b (if a>=b) is (a-b) steps to the left.\n\n   But note: the initial movement to the edge might be optimized by being in the middle.\n\n   However, we have two independent operations. We can also consider:\n\n   Option D: Maybe we can use the fact that after closing one side, the other side becomes easier? Actually, no because the required positions for closing each side are fixed (at l for left and at r for right) and the movement cost is linear.\n\n   But wait, what if the cursor is already in [l, r]? Then we can choose to go to l and then to r, or vice versa.\n\n   However, there is a catch: sometimes we can close both sides without moving to the edges? Actually, no, because the operation to close the left requires that we are at a tab that is the left boundary of the desired segment (l) so that we don't remove any tab from [l, r]. Similarly for the right.\n\n   But note: what if we are at a tab that is to the left of l? Then we cannot even start because we are outside the desired segment. Similarly, if we are to the right of r, we are outside. However, the problem states: \"the cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab\", and the desired segment is [l, r]. We are guaranteed that 1<=pos<=n and 1<=l<=r<=n, so initially the cursor is somewhere in [1, n] and the desired segment is [l, r]. It is possible that the cursor is not in [l, r] initially.\n\n   Example: n=10, pos=1, l=5, r=8.\n\n   Then we must close the left part (tabs 1 to 4) and the right part (tabs 9,10). \n\n   How to handle that?\n\n   In this case, we must first move the cursor from 1 to 5 (the left edge of the desired segment) to close the left part. Then we can close the left part (from 1 to 4) and then move from 5 to 8 (to close the right part). Alternatively, we could first move to 8 and then close the right part, then move to 5 and close the left part.\n\n   Steps for Option A (left first):\n        Move from 1 to 5: 4 seconds.\n        Close left: 1 second -> now the tabs are [5,10].\n        Then move from 5 to 8: 3 seconds.\n        Close right: 1 second.\n        Total: 4 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 9.\n\n   Steps for Option B (right first):\n        Move from 1 to 8: 7 seconds.\n        Close right: 1 second -> now the tabs are [1,8].\n        Then move from 8 to 5: 3 seconds.\n        Close left: 1 second.\n        Total: 7 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 12.\n\n   But wait, is there a better way? What if we do:\n\n        Option C: First move to 5, then close left, then close right without moving? \n        After closing left, the set of tabs is [5,10]. Now, we are at 5. To close the right, we must be at 8 (the right edge). So we have to move from 5 to 8 (3 steps) and then close the right.\n\n        Alternatively, after closing left, we are at 5. Then we can move to 8 (3 steps) and then close the right.\n\n        There is no way to close the right without being at 8.\n\n   Another possibility: maybe we can close the right part from a different position? The operation \"close right\" will close all tabs to the right of the cursor. So if we are at 7, we close from 8 to 10 (if the current right boundary is 10). But then we have to leave 8? No, because if we close from 8 to 10, then 8 is included in the closure? Wait, the operation is: close all tabs to the right of the cursor. The cursor is at 7, then we close [8,10]. Then the set becomes [5,7]. But then we need to have 8 open? So that would be incorrect.\n\n   Therefore, we must be at the right edge (r) to close the right part without affecting [l, r].\n\n   Similarly, we must be at l to close the left part without affecting [l, r].\n\n   So the above two options (A and B) are the only ways.\n\n   However, note: what if we don't need to close both sides? For example, if only one side needs to be closed.\n\n   Example: n=10, pos=5, l=5, r=8.\n        We need to close the right part (tabs 9,10). \n        Steps: move from 5 to 8 (3 seconds) and then close right (1 second). Total 4.\n\n        Alternatively, we could close the right part without moving? But we are at 5, and the operation \"close right\" would close from 6 to 10. Then we lose 6,7,8,9,10, which is bad.\n\n        So we must be at 8.\n\n        But wait: what if we do multiple moves and multiple closures? Actually, we can only close one side at a time, and we must be at the edge.\n\n   However, there is a smarter way: what if we close the right part from a position that is not the edge? Then we close too much. So that is not allowed.\n\n   Therefore, we must be at the edge.\n\n   Now, what if the cursor is not in the desired segment initially? Then we must move it to the desired segment.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let:\n        left_needed = (l > 1)\n        right_needed = (r < n)\n\n   But also, we must consider the initial position of the cursor relative to [l, r].\n\n   Case 1: The cursor is already in [l, r] (l <= pos <= r). Then we can choose to go to l and then to r (if both sides need closing) or just one edge (if only one side needs closing).\n\n   Case 2: The cursor is to the left of l (pos < l). Then we must move it to the right to at least l (to close the left part if needed) and similarly for the right.\n\n   Case 3: The cursor is to the right of r (pos > r). Then we must move it to the left to at least r.\n\n   So we can break the problem into:\n\n   If we don't need to close anything (l==1 and r==n), then 0.\n\n   Else, we have to close at least one side.\n\n   But note: the problem may require closing both sides, but the cursor might be in the middle. We have two orders: left then right, or right then left.\n\n   However, if the cursor is not in [l, r] initially, then we must move it to the segment [l, r] to be able to close the sides.\n\n   Example: n=10, pos=1, l=5, r=8 (as above).\n\n   How to account for the initial position?\n\n   We can consider:\n\n   Option 1: Close left first, then right.\n        Steps to move from pos (1) to l (5): |1-5| = 4.\n        Then close left: 1.\n        Then move from 5 to 8: |5-8| = 3.\n        Then close right: 1.\n        Total: 4+1+3+1 = 9.\n\n   Option 2: Close right first, then left.\n        Steps to move from 1 to 8: |1-8|=7.\n        Then close right: 1.\n        Then move from 8 to 5: |8-5|=3.\n        Then close left: 1.\n        Total: 7+1+3+1 = 12.\n\n   But wait, is there a way to do it with fewer moves?\n\n   Consider: we don't necessarily have to go to the edge first? Actually, we have to be at the edge to close the side.\n\n   However, note: when we are moving, the boundaries change. But initially, the boundaries are [1,10]. When we move, we can move freely until we close something. But the problem is that to close a side, we must be at the edge of the desired segment.\n\n   Therefore, we must end up at l to close left and at r to close right.\n\n   But note: the movement from the starting position to the desired edges might be optimized by being in the middle of the two edges? Actually, no: the two operations are independent.\n\n   However, if we are going to do both, then we have two possibilities:\n\n        Possibility 1: Go to l, then to r.\n        Possibility 2: Go to r, then to l.\n\n   The cost for Possibility 1: \n        |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2   (because we do |pos-l| to get to l, then |l-r| to get to r, and two closing operations)\n\n   The cost for Possibility 2:\n        |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2\n\n   But note: |l - r| = |r - l|, so the travel from one edge to the other is the same.\n\n   Then we choose the minimum of the two:\n\n        Option1 = |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2\n        Option2 = |pos - r| + |l - r| + 2\n\n        So we take min(Option1, Option2)\n\n   However, what if we don't need to do both? Then we only do one side.\n\n   We can have:\n\n        Case A: Only left needs to be closed (l==1 is false, i.e., l>1, and r==n, i.e., r<n is false) -> then we only need to close left.\n\n        Steps: \n            Move from pos to l (if pos < l, then we are to the left, so we move right; if pos > l, then we are to the right and we must move left? But wait: if we are to the right of l, then we are already in [l, n] (since l>1 and we are at pos, but note: if we are to the right of l, then we are in the desired segment? Actually, if we are to the right of l, then we are in [l, n] (if l>1 and we are at a position >= l). But we must close the left part, so we must be at l. So if we are to the right, we have to move left to l.\n\n            Actually, the condition for closing left is that we are at l (so that we close from 1 to l-1). Then the cost is |pos - l| + 1.\n\n        Similarly, if only the right needs to be closed (r<n and l==1), then the cost is |pos - r| + 1.\n\n        But wait: what if we are not in the segment [l, r] when only one side is closed? \n\n        Example: only left needs to be closed, and the cursor is at 10 (and n=10, so r=10, l=5). Then we are to the right of r? Actually, no: the desired segment is [5,10]. We are at 10, which is in [5,10]. So we can just close the left part from 10: we move from 10 to 5 (5 steps) and then close left (1). Total 6.\n\n        However, what if we are at 10, and we want to close the left part (from 1 to 4). We can also consider: we don't necessarily have to go to 5. But wait: to close the left part, we must be at 5 (the left edge of the desired segment) so that we don't close any part of [5,10]. If we are at 6, then we close from 1 to 5, which removes 5 and that's part of the desired segment. So we must be at 5.\n\n        Therefore, the above holds.\n\n   Now, what if the cursor is not in [l, r] and we need to close only one side?\n\n        Example: only left needs to be closed, and the cursor is at 3 (and desired segment is [5,10]). Then we are to the left of l. We must move to 5 (2 steps) and then close left (1). Total 3.\n\n        Example: only left needs to be closed, and the cursor is at 7 (desired segment [5,10]) -> we are in the segment. Then we move from 7 to 5 (2 steps) and close left (1). Total 3.\n\n        Example: only left needs to be closed, and the cursor is at 4 (desired segment [5,10]) -> we are to the left of l. Then we move from 4 to 5 (1 step) and close left (1). Total 2.\n\n        Example: only left needs to be closed, and the cursor is at 11 (but wait, n=10, so the cursor cannot be at 11). The problem says 1<=pos<=n.\n\n   So the general solution:\n\n        If we need to close the left part (l > 1) and the right part (r < n):\n\n            total_seconds = min( |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2, |pos - r| + |l - r| + 2 )\n\n        Else if we need to close the left part (l > 1) only:\n\n            total_seconds = |pos - l| + 1   # because we must go to l (if we are not already there) and then close left.\n\n        Else if we need to close the right part (r < n) only:\n\n            total_seconds = |pos - r| + 1\n\n        Else: (no closing needed) 0.\n\n   However, wait: what if the cursor is not in [l, r] initially and we need to close only one side? \n\n        Example: only left needs to be closed, and the cursor is at 3 (and desired segment [5,10]). Then we must move from 3 to 5 (distance 2) and then close left (1). This matches.\n\n        Example: only right needs to be closed, and the cursor is at 15 (but n=10, so invalid). \n\n        But note: if we are in the segment [l, r] initially and we need to close only one side, then we must move to the edge (l or r) and then close. \n\n        Example: only left needs to be closed, and the cursor is at 6 (desired segment [5,10]) -> we are in [5,10]. We must move from 6 to 5 (1 step) and then close left (1). Total 2.\n\n        Example: only right needs to be closed, and the cursor is at 9 (desired segment [5,10]) -> we are in [5,10]. We must move from 9 to 10 (1 step) and then close right (1). Total 2.\n\n   But wait, what if the cursor is to the left of l and we need to close the left part? Then we must move to l (because the operation \"close left\" from a position < l would close from 1 to (cursor-1) and that doesn't necessarily cover the entire left part? Actually, no: we have to close the entire left part from 1 to l-1. But if we are at a position i (which is < l) and we close the left, then we close from 1 to i-1. Then we still have tabs from i to l-1 open. Then we have to close those as well? \n\n   Actually, no: the operation \"close left\" closes all tabs to the left of the cursor. So if we are at i (which is < l), then we close from 1 to i-1. Then the left boundary becomes i. Then we still have the tabs from i to l-1 open. Then we must close them again? \n\n   But note: the problem says we can close all the tabs to the left of the cursor. We are allowed to do multiple operations. However, we can also move the cursor to the right (within the current boundaries) to eventually reach l and then close the entire left part (from 1 to l-1).\n\n   However, the operation \"close left\" from a position i (which is < l) doesn't close the entire left part. Therefore, we must move to l (the left edge) to close the entire left part (from 1 to l-1). \n\n   But wait: what if we do two separate close left operations? \n\n        Example: n=10, l=5, r=10, and we are at 3.\n\n        Operation 1: close left from 3 -> closes tabs 1,2. Now the set is [3,10]. The left boundary is 3.\n        Operation 2: then we can move from 3 to 5 (2 steps) and then close left from 5 -> closes tabs 3 to 4? No, wait: the operation \"close left\" from 5 would close from the current left boundary (which is 3) to 4. Then we get [5,10]. But we wanted to leave [5,10] anyway.\n\n        But note: the problem says we must leave only [l, r]. So we must close everything not in [5,10]. \n\n        However, after the first close left, we have [3,10] and we still have to close [3,4]. Then we must be at 5 to close [3,4] (because if we are at 5, then the left boundary is 3, and we close from 3 to 4). Then the set becomes [5,10].\n\n        Then the steps for this example (if we do two close left operations) would be:\n\n            Start: cursor at 3, set [1..10]\n            Step1: close left (from 1 to 2) -> set [3..10] (1 second)\n            Step2: move from 3 to 5 (2 seconds)\n            Step3: close left (from 3 to 4) -> set [5..10] (1 second)\n\n            Total: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.\n\n        But according to our previous formula for the one-side case, we would have said: move from 3 to 5 (2 seconds) and then close left (1 second) -> total 3. \n\n        Why is the above method 4? Because we did an extra move and an extra close? Actually, the above method is not necessary. We don't need to do two separate close left operations. We can simply move to 5 and then do one close left operation that closes from 3 to 4 (since the current left boundary is 3) and that is sufficient.\n\n        But wait: the operation \"close left\" from 5 (when the set is [3..10]) closes the entire left part (from the current left boundary to 5-1). The current left boundary is 3, so it closes [3,4]. Then we are done.\n\n        However, the problem does not require that we close the left part in one operation. But note: we are allowed to do multiple operations. But the minimal time should consider the most efficient way.\n\n        In the above, if we move to 5 and then close left, we close two segments: [1,2] and [3,4] in one operation? Actually, no: the operation from 5 will close [3,4] (the left part from the current left boundary to 4). But we never closed [1,2]! \n\n        Wait, no: initially, the left boundary is 1. Then when we move from 3 to 5, the left boundary is still 1? Or does closing the left part from 3 (in the first operation) change the left boundary to 3? \n\n        The problem states: \n            \"close all the tabs to the left of the cursor\"\n\n        After the first operation (closing left from 3), the set becomes [3..10] and the left boundary becomes 3.\n\n        Then when we move from 3 to 5, the left boundary remains 3.\n\n        Then when we close left from 5, we close from 3 to 4.\n\n        So the two operations together close [1,2] and [3,4]. \n\n        But the direct method: move from 3 to 5 (without closing in between) and then close left from 5: \n            Start: set [1..10], cursor at 3.\n            Move to 5: \n                Step1: move from 3 to 4 (left boundary still 1, so the set remains [1..10])\n                Step2: move from 4 to 5 (set remains [1..10])\n            Then close left from 5: closes [1..4]. Then the set becomes [5..10]. \n\n        This is also valid and takes 2 (moves) + 1 (close) = 3 seconds.\n\n        So the method that moves to 5 (without closing) and then closes is better.\n\n        Therefore, the key is: we must be at the edge (l) of the desired segment to close the entire left part (from 1 to l-1) in one operation. But note: if we are at a position greater than or equal to l, then the entire left part (from 1 to l-1) is to the left of the cursor (if the cursor is at a position >= l) and we can close it.\n\n        However, wait: if we are at a position >= l, then the entire left part (from 1 to l-1) is to the left of the cursor. So we can close it from any position >= l? \n\n        But then why did the example above require being at l? \n\n        Example: n=10, l=5, r=10, cursor at 6. \n            We can close the left part from 6: then we close from 1 to 5. But wait, 5 is the left edge and we want to keep it. So that would remove 5, which is not allowed.\n\n        Therefore, we must be at l (the left edge) to close the left part without affecting the desired segment.\n\n        Similarly, for the right part, we must be at r.\n\n        So the requirement is: we must be at l to close the left part, and at r to close the right part.\n\n        Then the method for closing the left part (if needed) is:\n\n            We must move the cursor to l (if we are not already there) and then close the left part.\n\n        Similarly, for the right part.\n\n        But note: if we are already at l (or at r) then we don't need to move.\n\n        Therefore, the cost for closing the left part (if needed) is |pos - l| (to move to l) + 1 (to close).\n\n        Similarly, for the right part: |pos - r| + 1.\n\n        However, if we have to do both, then we must do:\n\n            Option1: go to l first, then go to r (from l to r) and then close both (two operations: one for left and one for right).\n            Steps: \n                Move from pos to l: |pos-l|\n                Then move from l to r: |l - r|\n                Then two operations: 2\n                Total: |pos-l| + |l-r| + 2\n\n            Option2: go to r first, then go to l (from r to l) and then two operations.\n            Steps:\n                Move from pos to r: |pos-r|\n                Then move from r to l: |r-l|\n                Then two operations: 2\n                Total: |pos-r| + |r-l| + 2\n\n        Since |l-r| = |r-l|, we can compute:\n\n            total_seconds = min( |pos-l| + |l-r| + 2, |pos-r| + |l-r| + 2 )\n\n        But wait: what if we are already in the segment [l, r]? Then we don't need to move to the edge? Actually, we still have to move to the edge (l or r) to close the side. \n\n        Example: n=10, pos=7, l=5, r=10 (we need to close the left part only). \n            Then we must move from 7 to 5 (distance 2) and then close left (1). Total 3.\n\n        Example: n=10, pos=7, l=5, r=10, and we need to close both. Then:\n\n            Option1: |7-5| + |5-10| + 2 = 2 + 5 + 2 = 9.\n            Option2: |7-10| + |10-5| + 2 = 3 + 5 + 2 = 10.\n\n            So we choose 9.\n\n        However, note: when we close the left part first, we are at 5. Then the set becomes [5,10]. Then we need to close the right part: we must be at 10. Then we move from 5 to 10 (5 steps). Then close right (1). Total 2+5+1+1=9.\n\n        But wait, the two operations (close left and close right) are included in the formula as two additional seconds (so 2). And the movement from 7 to 5 (2) and then 5 to 10 (5) gives 2+5+2=9.\n\n        Now, what if the cursor is not in the segment [l, r] initially and we need to close only one side?\n\n        Example: n=10, l=5, r=10, pos=4 (only left part needed). Then we must move from 4 to 5 (1) and then close left (1). Total 2.\n\n        Example: n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] in her browser. The browser starts with n tabs, and the cursor is initially at position pos. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right by one tab per second or closing all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to leave only the tabs from l to r inclusive. This requires closing tabs to the left of l and/or to the right of r. The key observation is that to close all tabs to the left of l, the cursor must be at position l. Similarly, to close all tabs to the right of r, the cursor must be at position r.\n2. **Intuition**: \n   - If no tabs need to be closed (i.e., l == 1 and r == n), the answer is 0.\n   - If only the left side needs closing (l > 1), the answer is the time to move from the initial cursor position to l plus one second for the close operation.\n   - If only the right side needs closing (r < n), the answer is the time to move from the initial cursor position to r plus one second for the close operation.\n   - If both sides need closing, the answer is the minimum of two options: moving to l first then to r, or moving to r first then to l, each including two close operations (one for each side).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves checking the conditions for which side(s) need closing and calculating the minimal time based on the cursor's initial position and the required movements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    left_needed = (l > 1)\n    right_needed = (r < n)\n    \n    if not left_needed and not right_needed:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    if left_needed and not right_needed:\n        distance = abs(pos - l)\n        print(distance + 1)\n        return\n        \n    if right_needed and not left_needed:\n        distance = abs(pos - r)\n        print(distance + 1)\n        return\n        \n    if left_needed and right_needed:\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2\n        print(min(option1, option2))\n        return\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initial Check**: If the entire range of tabs (1 to n) is already within [l, r], no operations are needed, so the answer is 0.\n- **Single Side Closing**: If only the left side needs closing (tabs before l), the time is the distance from the initial cursor position to l plus one second for the close operation. Similarly for the right side.\n- **Both Sides Closing**: The minimal time is calculated by considering two scenarios: moving to l first then to r, or moving to r first then to l. Each scenario includes moving to the respective edge and performing two close operations (left and right). The minimal time between these two scenarios is chosen as the answer.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all possible cases by leveraging simple arithmetic and conditional checks, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
