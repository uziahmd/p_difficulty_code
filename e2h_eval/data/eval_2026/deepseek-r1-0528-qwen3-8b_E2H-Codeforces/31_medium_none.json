Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards)\n We can use any number of additional cards, each with an integer from -x to x (excluding 0? Actually including 0? But note: the problem says \"each card\" doesn't exceed x in absolute value, so from -x to x inclusive.\n\n However, note: the problem says that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x. So we can use any integer in that range arbitrarily many times.\n\n We are to find the minimum number of additional cards such that the sum of all found cards (including the additional ones) is zero.\n\n Let S be the sum of the found cards.\n\n Then we need to choose k additional cards (each between -x and x) such that their sum is -S, and we want the smallest k.\n\n How to think?\n We are allowed to choose any numbers in the range [-x, x]. The goal is to represent the integer T = -S as a sum of k numbers, each between -x and x, and we want the minimal k.\n\n Note: Since we can use any integer in [-x, x], the set of achievable sums with k cards is all integers from -k*x to k*x, but with some gaps? Actually, no: we can achieve every integer in that range if k>=1? \n\n However, consider: with one card, we can get any integer from -x to x.\n With two cards, we can get from -2x to 2x, but not necessarily every integer? Actually, we can get every integer in between because we can adjust by one. For example, from two cards: \n   The minimum is -2x, maximum 2x, and for any integer s in [-2x, 2x], we can write s = a + b where a,b in [-x,x]? \n   But note: we can have a from max(-x, s-x) to min(x, s+x) and then b = s - a must be in [-x,x]. Actually, the condition is that |s| <= 2x and then we can always represent s with two cards? Not exactly: \n   Example: x=1, then two cards: the possible sums are from -2 to 2, but we can get every integer: \n        -2: (-1,-1)\n        -1: (-1,0) or (0,-1) but wait, 0 is allowed? The problem says the initial set includes 0? Actually, the problem says \"each integer from -x to x\", so 0 is included.\n\n However, note the problem statement: \"the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value\". And the initial set includes all integers from -x to x (so including 0). \n\n But wait: what if x=1? Then the set is {-1,0,1}. Then two cards can form:\n   -2: (-1,-1)\n   -1: (-1,0) or (-1,1) doesn't give -1 with two cards? Actually, (-1,0) gives -1, and also (0,-1) is same. Also, (-1,-1) gives -2, (0,0) gives 0, etc.\n\n Actually, the key point: we are allowed to use 0. So with two cards, we can get every integer between -2x and 2x, because we can break the sum into two parts and use 0 to adjust.\n\n However, there is a catch: the problem does not require the additional cards to be distinct. So we can use zeros arbitrarily.\n\n So the problem reduces to: what is the minimum k such that T = -S is in the interval [-k*x, k*x]?\n\n Why? Because with k cards, the minimum sum we can get is -k*x (if we take k cards of -x) and maximum is k*x (k cards of x). Moreover, since we can use zeros and positive/negative numbers arbitrarily, we can actually achieve every integer between -k*x and k*x (because the step is 1). \n\n Therefore, we just need to find the smallest k (nonnegative integer) such that |T| <= k*x.\n\n But note: k must be at least 0.\n\n However, what if T=0? Then k=0.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"minimum number of cards does he need to find\". So if the current sum S is already 0, then we don't need to find any card.\n\n But note: the input may have negative and positive numbers, and we might have a non-zero sum.\n\n So algorithm:\n\n Step 1: Read n and x, then the list of n integers.\n\n Step 2: Compute T = -sum(found_cards)\n\n Step 3: If T==0, output 0.\n\n Step 4: Otherwise, we need the smallest k (positive integer) such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n However, note: the above reasoning says that with k cards we can achieve any integer from -k*x to k*x. Therefore, we can achieve T (which is an integer) if |T| <= k*x.\n\n But note: k must be an integer and we are looking for the minimal k.\n\n However, consider: is it always that we can achieve T with k cards if |T|<=k*x? \n\n Yes, because we can use the following greedy-like idea: \n   We can use as many x's as needed until we get to the desired T, but we might overshoot. However, note that we can use negative numbers too.\n\n Actually, we can use a combination of positive and negative numbers. The key is that the total range is symmetric and we can adjust by 1's (because 0 is available). \n\n But wait: what if we have to achieve T=1 and x=1? Then k=1: we can use a single 1. \n What if T=2 and x=1? Then k=2: we can use two 1's.\n\n But note: we can also use negative numbers. However, we are trying to achieve T=2 with x=1 and k=2: \n   Two cards: maximum positive is 2 (1+1). So yes.\n\n Similarly, T=-3 and x=2: we need k= ceil(|-3|/2) = ceil(3/2)=2? But with k=2, maximum absolute value we can get is 4 (since 2*2=4). But we need to get -3. \n   How? We can use two cards: -2 and -1 -> that's -3. But wait, we can only use numbers from -2 to 2. So that works.\n\n Therefore, the minimal k is ceil(|T| / x) if |T| is not zero? \n\n But wait: let me check with T=3 and x=2: \n   We need k such that k*2 >= 3 -> k>=2 (since 2*2=4>=3). But with k=2: can we represent 3? \n        The maximum positive sum with two cards is 4 (two 2's). But we can do 2+1=3? But wait: the available numbers are from -2 to 2, so 1 is allowed. So yes.\n\n However, note that the above formula k = ceil(|T| / x) is not exactly correct because we are allowed to use negative and positive arbitrarily. Actually, the condition is that we can represent T if |T| <= k*x. \n\n But note: the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |T|. \n\n However, note that k*x must be at least |T|, so k >= ceil(|T| / x). But wait: what if |T| is divisible by x? Then k_min = |T| // x, because k_min * x = |T|, which is >= |T|.\n\n Example: T=4, x=2 -> k_min = ceil(4/2)=ceil(2)=2, and 2*2=4 >=4 -> yes.\n\n But what if T=5, x=2? Then k_min = ceil(5/2)=ceil(2.5)=3. And 3*2=6>=5 -> yes.\n\n However, is that sufficient? In fact, we can always represent T if k*x >= |T|? \n\n Consider: we are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x]. We can use a linear combination of these. But note: the set of numbers we can use is symmetric and includes 0. \n\n We can use a strategy: we will use as many x as needed, but we can also use negative numbers to adjust. However, we are only concerned with the minimal k.\n\n Actually, the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |T|, and then we can represent T because:\n\n   Let k0 = ceil(|T| / x). Then we have k0*x >= |T|.\n\n   Now, we can use k0 cards to form T. We can use positive and negative numbers arbitrarily. \n\n   We can set: we need to achieve T. We can use some positive numbers and some negative numbers. The total positive part must be at least |T| (if T is positive) but note: we can use negative numbers too. \n\n   Actually, we can use a different approach: we want to minimize k, and the condition is that the maximum absolute value we can represent is k*x (if we use all x's or all -x's) but we can mix. \n\n   However, note that the set of numbers we can form is contiguous from -k*x to k*x. This is because:\n\n     Base: with k=1, we can form [-x, x].\n     Then for k=2, we can form from -2x to 2x because we can add any two numbers from [-x,x] and the set of sums is symmetric and contiguous.\n\n   In fact, for k cards, we can form every integer from -k*x to k*x. Why?\n      By induction: for k=1, true.\n      Suppose for k-1 we can form every integer from -(k-1)*x to (k-1)*x.\n      Then for k, we can take a number a from [-x,x] and add it to any number from the previous set. Then the new set is [-(k-1)*x - x, (k-1)*x + x] = [-k*x, k*x]. But is every integer in this range achieved?\n\n      Consider an integer s in [-k*x, k*x]. We can write s = t + a, where t is in the (k-1)-card set and a in [-x,x]. Since the (k-1)-card set is contiguous, and we can shift by a (which is an integer from -x to x), then the entire interval [-k*x, k*x] is covered.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n   But note: we are allowed to use zeros. The contiguous property holds.\n\n   However, there is a caveat: what if T=0? Then k=0 is the answer.\n\n   So the minimal k is:\n        k_min = 0 if T==0\n        otherwise, k_min = ceil(|T| / x)\n\n   But wait: what if |T| is 0? Then k_min=0.\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute: k_min = ceil(|T| / x) if |T|>0, else 0.\n\n   However, note: if |T| is 0, then ceil(0/x)=0, so we can write: k_min = ceil(|T| / x) if we define ceil(0/x)=0.\n\n   But the problem: the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |T|. \n\n   We can compute k_min = (abs(T) + x - 1) // x  if abs(T) > 0, but note: if abs(T)==0, then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x = 0 (if x>=1, which it is). \n\n   However, let's check:\n\n        k_min = ceil(|T| / x) = (|T| + x - 1) // x   [for positive |T|]\n\n   Example: T=3, x=2 -> (3+2-1)//2 = (4)//2 = 2 -> correct.\n\n   But wait: what if T=4, x=2: (4+2-1)//2 = (5)//2 = 2 -> correct.\n\n   However, note: the formula for ceiling division: ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) // b, when a and b are positive.\n\n   But what if T is negative? Then |T| is positive.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        T = -sum(found_cards)\n        abs_T = abs(T)\n\n        if abs_T == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # Compute k = ceil(abs_T / x)\n            k = (abs_T + x - 1) // x\n\n   However, wait: is that always the minimal k? \n\n   Example: first sample: \n        Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n        n=3, x=2, cards = [-1,1,2] -> sum = -1+1+2 = 2, so T = -2, abs_T=2.\n        k = (2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 (in integer floor division) -> 1. Correct.\n\n   Second sample: \n        Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n        n=2, x=3, cards = [-2,-2] -> sum = -4, T=4, abs_T=4.\n        k = (4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3 = 2. Correct.\n\n   But wait, what if T=1, x=2?\n        k = (1+2-1)//2 = (2)//2 = 1 -> correct.\n\n   Another example: T=5, x=3: \n        k = (5+3-1)//3 = (7)//3 = 2 (since 7//3 in integer floor division is 2) -> but 2*3=6>=5, so yes.\n\n   However, is k=2 sufficient? We need to form 5 with two cards, each between -3 and 3. \n        Maximum we can get with two cards is 6 (3+3). But we need 5: 3+2=5, and 2 is allowed. So yes.\n\n   But wait, what about T=3, x=2: k= ceil(3/2)=2, and 2*2=4>=3, and indeed 2+1=3.\n\n   However, note: the above formula (abs_T+x-1)//x is the ceiling of (abs_T/x). \n\n   But wait: what if T is negative? We use abs_T so it's the same.\n\n   Therefore, code:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        total_sum = sum(cards)\n        T = -total_sum\n\n        if T == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            abs_T = abs(T)\n            # Ceiling division: (abs_T + x - 1) // x\n            k = (abs_T + x - 1) // x\n            # However, wait: is it possible that k*x >= abs_T but k is not enough? No, because we proved the contiguous property.\n\n            print(k)\n\n   But wait: is there a possibility that the minimal k is less than the ceiling? No, because with k-1 cards, the maximum absolute value we can represent is (k-1)*x, which is < abs_T (because k-1 < ceil(|T|/x) => (k-1)*x < |T|). Therefore, k-1 is not enough.\n\n   However, let me test with an edge: T=1, x=1 -> k = (1+1-1)//1 = 1//1 = 1. Correct.\n\n   But wait: what if T=0? We handled separately.\n\n   However, note: the above formula for k works for T=0 too: (0+1-1)//x = 0//x=0. So we can avoid the if:\n\n        k = (abs(T) + x - 1) // x\n\n   But note: if T=0, then abs(T)=0, then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x. For x>=1, (x-1)//x is 0. So we can simply do:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        total_sum = sum(cards)\n        T = -total_sum\n        abs_T = abs(T)\n        # If T==0, then abs_T=0, then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x. Since x>=1, (x-1)//x is 0.\n\n        k = (abs_T + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n   However, wait: what if T is negative? We take abs(T) so it's positive.\n\n   But wait: what if the minimal k is not just ceil(|T|/x)? \n\n   Let me consider: we are allowed to use negative and positive arbitrarily. The condition is that the total sum of the additional cards must be T (which is -total_sum). \n\n   The minimal k is the smallest integer such that k*x >= |T|, because we can use up to k*x (in absolute value) to cover T. \n\n   However, note: we are allowed to use numbers from -x to x, so the total sum of the additional cards must be T, and the minimal k is the smallest integer for which the range [-k*x, k*x] covers T.\n\n   But note: the range [-k*x, k*x] is symmetric and the condition for covering T is |T|<=k*x.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal k is indeed ceil(|T|/x).\n\n   But wait: what if T is negative? Then |T| is positive, and we use the same formula.\n\n   However, note: the problem allows any integer in [-x,x]. Therefore, the above reasoning holds.\n\n   But wait: there is a known issue with the ceiling division formula when T=0: (0+x-1)//x is 0, which is correct.\n\n   However, let me test with a negative T: say T=-5, then abs(T)=5, same as T=5.\n\n   Example: T=-5, x=3 -> k = (5+3-1)//3 = 7//3 = 2 (in integer floor division, 7//3=2). Then 2*3=6>=5, and we can form -5: for example, -3 and -2 (which is allowed since -2 is in [-3,3]). Or even one card? No, because one card can only be from -3 to 3, and -5 is outside. So two cards is minimal.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(cards)\n        T = -s\n        abs_T = abs(T)\n\n        # If T is 0, then abs_T is 0, then k = (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x, which is 0 for any x>=1.\n        k = (abs_T + x - 1) // x\n\n        print(k)\n\n   But wait: is that the minimal number of cards? \n\n   However, there is a catch: sometimes we might be able to use fewer cards by using a combination that doesn't just rely on the maximum absolute value? \n\n   Let me reexamine: the condition is that the total sum of the additional cards must be T, and the minimal k is the smallest integer such that k*x >= |T|. \n\n   This is because the maximum absolute value we can represent with k cards is k*x (by using k cards of x or -x). And we can represent every integer in between. \n\n   Therefore, the minimal k is indeed ceil(|T|/x).\n\n   However, wait: what if T=0? Then k=0, which is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if we have a negative T? Then we need to form a negative sum. The same logic applies.\n\n   However, consider: what if we have a very large T? The formula still holds.\n\n   But wait: what if T is positive and we use negative numbers? That would make the sum more negative, so we cannot use negative numbers arbitrarily to reduce the required k. Actually, we are free to use positive and negative arbitrarily. The key is that the maximum absolute value we can get is k*x, so if |T| <= k*x, then we can form T.\n\n   Therefore, the above code should be correct.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples:\n\n   Example 1: Input \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n        n=3, x=2, cards=[-1,1,2] -> s = -1+1+2 = 2, T=-2, abs_T=2.\n        k = (2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 (since 3//2 in Python is 1) -> output 1. Correct.\n\n   Example 2: Input \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n        n=2, x=3, cards=[-2,-2] -> s=-4, T=4, abs_T=4.\n        k = (4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3 = 2. Correct.\n\n   However, wait: what if we have a different scenario? Consider:\n\n        Input: \"1 1\\n0\"\n        Then n=1, x=1, card=[0] -> s=0, T=0 -> k=0. Correct.\n\n        Input: \"1 1\\n1\"\n        Then s=1, T=-1, abs_T=1 -> k=(1+1-1)//1 = 1//1=1. Correct.\n\n        Input: \"1 1\\n-1\"\n        Then s=-1, T=1, abs_T=1 -> k=1. Correct.\n\n        Input: \"2 1\\n1 1\"\n        Then s=2, T=-2, abs_T=2 -> k=(2+1-1)//1 = 2//1=2. Correct: we need two cards of -1 to get -2.\n\n        Input: \"2 1\\n1 -1\"\n        Then s=0, T=0 -> k=0. Correct.\n\n   But wait: what if T is 0? Then we output 0.\n\n   However, note: the problem says that we can use any number of additional cards. So if the sum is already 0, we don't need any.\n\n   But wait: what if we have a non-zero T that is very small, but x is very large? Then k=ceil(|T|/x) = 1 if |T|>=1? \n\n        Example: T=1, x=1000 -> k=ceil(1/1000)=1. Correct.\n\n   But wait: what if T=0? Then we output 0.\n\n   However, there's a catch: what if we have a negative T and x is positive? The formula uses absolute value so it's okay.\n\n   But wait: what if T is fractional? No, T is an integer because the found cards are integers and x is integer.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(cards)\n        T = -s\n        abs_T = abs(T)\n        # If T==0, then abs_T==0, then k= (0+x-1)//x, which is 0 for any x>=1.\n        k = (abs_T + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n   However, wait: there is an alternative way. What if we can use the existing cards to cancel out? Actually, the problem is about adding cards. The existing cards are fixed. We are only allowed to add cards (with numbers from -x to x) to make the total sum zero.\n\n   But note: the above reasoning is independent of the existing cards except for the total sum T. \n\n   However, wait: the problem does not say we can remove cards. We are only allowed to add. So the existing cards are fixed and we are adding more.\n\n   But the above calculation of T is correct: we need to add cards whose sum is - (sum of existing cards).\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   But wait: the problem statement says \"the minimum number of cards does he need to find\", and we are calculating the minimal k such that the sum of k cards (each in [-x,x]) equals T.\n\n   However, there is a catch: the problem does not require the additional cards to be distinct, and we can use zeros. \n\n   But note: we are not constrained by the found cards beyond their sum.\n\n   Therefore, the above solution is correct.\n\n   However, wait: the example inputs are provided as strings. The example input format is:\n\n        ['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n   But our code reads from stdin. The sample input is given as two lines.\n\n   We are reading:\n\n        first_line = input().split()\n        n = int(first_line[0]), x = int(first_line[1])\n        second_line = input().split()\n\n   This matches the problem.\n\n   But wait: what if there are multiple test cases? The problem says: the first line contains n and x, then the next line contains n integers.\n\n   There is only one test case.\n\n   Therefore, we output the code as below.\n\n   However, wait: I just realized that the ceiling division formula (abs_T+x-1)//x is standard for positive integers. But if abs_T is 0, then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x. For integer x, (x-1)//x is 0. So it's correct.\n\n   Let me test with x=1 and T=0: (0+1-1)//1 = 0//1=0. Correct.\n\n   Therefore, final code:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        T = -s\n        abs_T = abs(T)\n        # If T==0, then we don't need any card.\n        # Otherwise, we need k = ceil(|T|/x)\n        if abs_T == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # Ceiling division for positive integers\n            k = (abs_T + x - 1) // x\n            print(k)\n\n   But wait, the if is redundant because (0+x-1)//x is 0, so we can remove the if.\n\n   Final code without if:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        T = -s\n        abs_T = abs(T)\n        k = (abs_T + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n   However, wait: what if T is negative? We use abs(T) so that's okay.\n\n   But wait: what if the minimal k is 0? Then we output 0.\n\n   Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n   But wait: there's a known issue with the ceiling division: when abs_T is 0, then (0+x-1)//x is (x-1)//x. For example, x=1000, then (999)//1000=0. Correct.\n\n   However, note: if abs_T is positive, then (abs_T+x-1)//x is the ceiling of (abs_T/x). \n\n   But wait: what if abs_T is divisible by x? Then (abs_T+x-1)//x = (abs_T-1)//x + 1, and if abs_T = k*x, then (k*x+x-1)//x = (k*x+x-1)//x = k + (x-1)//x, and (x-1)//x is 0 (if x>0) so then k. But wait, if abs_T=k*x, then (k*x+x-1)//x = k + (x-1)//x, and (x-1)//x is 0 for integer division? Actually, (k*x+x-1)//x = k + (x-1)//x, but (x-1)//x is 0, so k. Correct.\n\n   Example: abs_T=4, x=2 -> (4+2-1)//2=5//2=2 (floor division) -> 2, which is correct.\n\n   But wait: the formula (a+b-1)//b is the ceiling of a/b for positive integers a and b. \n\n   Therefore, we are confident.\n\n   However, wait: the problem constraints say n and x are at least 1 and at most 1000, and the numbers on the found cards do not exceed x in absolute value.\n\n   But note: the absolute value of the sum T might be large? The maximum absolute value of one card is x, and there are n cards (n<=1000). So the maximum absolute value of T is at most 1000*x (which is 1000000) and x>=1, so abs_T can be up to 1000000. \n\n   The formula (abs_T+x-1)//x uses integer arithmetic, which is safe in Python for numbers up to 1000000.\n\n   Therefore, we can run the code.\n\n   However, wait: what if T is very large? For example, n=1000, x=1, then the maximum absolute value of the sum is 1000, so T=-1000, then k=ceil(1000/1)=1000. Correct.\n\n   But wait: what if we have 1000 cards, each being 1, then T=-1000, and we need 1000 cards of -1 to cancel. Correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        T = -s\n        abs_T = abs(T)\n        k = (abs_T + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n   But wait: wait a minute! There is a flaw.\n\n   Consider: what if we can use the existing cards to help? Actually, no: we are only allowed to add cards. The existing cards are fixed. We cannot change them.\n\n   But wait: the problem is that we are allowed to use any cards from the infinite set (with numbers from -x to x). We are not limited by the found cards.\n\n   However, there is another way: sometimes we can use fewer cards by using negative numbers to cancel a positive sum, but the minimal k is still determined by the condition that the total absolute value must be at least |T|.\n\n   But wait: is that condition necessary and sufficient?\n\n   Necessary: because the total absolute value (if we break down the additional cards) must be at least |T| (if we consider the worst-case, we need to cover the deficit). \n\n   However, note: we are allowed to use positive and negative arbitrarily. The condition is that the total sum must be T, and the minimal k is the smallest integer such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n   But wait: what if T is positive? Then we need to add positive numbers to offset the negative existing sum. But wait: the existing sum is s, and we need to add cards with total sum -s (which is positive if s is negative). \n\n   Actually, the condition is independent of the sign of T because we use absolute value.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says \"Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2\" for the first sample. Our code returns 1, which is correct.\n\n   But wait: there is an alternative solution that considers the possibility of using existing cards to cancel by adding both positive and negative? Actually, no: the existing cards are fixed and we are only adding. The goal is to have the total sum (existing plus additional) equal to 0.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal k is indeed the minimal number of cards to add such that their sum is -s.\n\n   And that minimal k is ceil(|-s|/x) = ceil(|s|/x).\n\n   But wait: why did we use T=-s? Because we need the additional cards to sum to -s. The absolute value of that is |s|.\n\n   So we can simplify:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        abs_s = abs(s)\n        k = (abs_s + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n   Because T=-s, so |T|=|s|.\n\n   Therefore, we can even skip the T variable.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        abs_s = abs(s)\n        k = (abs_s + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n   Let me test with the examples again:\n\n        Example1: arr=[-1,1,2] -> s=2, abs_s=2, k=(2+2-1)//2=3//2=1 -> correct.\n\n        Example2: arr=[-2,-2] -> s=-4, abs_s=4, k=(4+3-1)//3=6//3=2 -> correct.\n\n   Therefore, we output the code.\n\n   However, wait: what if the sum s is negative? Then abs_s is positive, and the formula holds.\n\n   Example: s=-5 -> abs_s=5, then k=(5+x-1)//x.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        abs_s = abs(s)\n        k = (abs_s + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n   But wait: the problem statement says that the numbers on the found cards are from -x to x. But the sum s can be negative or positive.\n\n   This code is simpler and avoids the negative T.\n\n   However, wait: is the minimal k always ceil(|s|/x)? \n\n   Let me think: we need to add cards such that the total sum becomes 0. The current sum is s, so we need to add cards that sum to -s. The minimal number of cards required to achieve a sum of -s (where -s can be positive or negative) is the same as achieving a sum of |s| in absolute value, because we can use negative cards to achieve a negative sum. \n\n   Actually, the minimal k is the same as if we were to achieve a sum of |s| (in terms of absolute value) because the set of achievable sums is symmetric.\n\n   Therefore, the above code is correct.\n\n   However, wait: there is a known pitfall: the ceiling division formula (a+b-1)//b is for positive integers. But if abs_s is 0, then (0+x-1)//x is 0, which is correct.\n\n   We'll submit this code.\n\n   But wait: the problem constraints say that n>=1 and x>=1, so we don't have to worry about division by zero.\n\n   Therefore, final code:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        abs_s = abs(s)\n        k = (abs_s + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n   However, wait: I just thought of an example where the minimal k might be less than ceil(|s|/x) because we can use the existing cards' values to cancel by adding a mix of positive and negative? \n\n   But note: we are only allowed to add cards. The existing cards are fixed and cannot be changed. The additional cards must sum to -s.\n\n   Example: existing cards sum to 3, then we need to add cards that sum to -3. The minimal k is ceil(3/x). \n\n   But wait, what if we have existing cards that are negative? Then s is negative, and we need to add cards that sum to -s (positive). The minimal k is ceil(|s|/x).\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   However, wait: what if we have existing cards that are positive and negative and their sum is s, and we need to add cards to cancel s. The minimal k is ceil(|s|/x). \n\n   But note: the existing cards are fixed and we cannot change them, so we must use additional cards to compensate.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"the minimum number of cards does he need to find\", and we are calculating the minimal k for the additional cards.\n\n   We are done.\n\n   However, wait: there is a known alternative solution in competitive programming for this problem.\n\n   After checking, I recall that sometimes the problem is solved by considering the possibility of using the existing cards to form a partial cancellation, but in this problem, we",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his found cards becomes zero. Each additional card can have any integer value between -x and x (inclusive). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the sum of the additional cards must exactly counterbalance the sum of the already found cards. If the sum of the found cards is `s`, then the sum of the additional cards must be `-s`. The minimal number of cards required to achieve this sum is determined by the ceiling of the absolute value of `s` divided by `x`, because each card can contribute at most `x` (in absolute value) towards the desired sum.\n\n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of cards needed is the smallest integer `k` such that `k * x >= |s|`. This is because with `k` cards, the maximum absolute sum achievable is `k * x` (by using `k` cards of value `x` or `-x`). \n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves calculating the sum of the found cards, taking its absolute value, and then computing the ceiling of this value divided by `x` using integer arithmetic. The formula `(abs_s + x - 1) // x` effectively computes the ceiling without floating-point operations.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves a single pass through the list of found cards to compute their sum, which is O(n) time complexity, where `n` is the number of cards. The space complexity is O(1) as we only store the sum and the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    arr = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    s = sum(arr)\n    abs_s = abs(s)\n    k = (abs_s + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains two integers, `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of any card). The second line contains `n` integers representing the values on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. This sum determines the target sum (`-s`) that the additional cards must achieve.\n3. **Absolute Value**: The absolute value of the sum is taken to handle both positive and negative sums uniformly.\n4. **Ceiling Division**: The minimal number of cards is calculated using the formula `(abs_s + x - 1) // x`, which efficiently computes the ceiling of `abs_s / x` using integer arithmetic.\n5. **Output Result**: The result, which is the minimal number of additional cards needed, is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and correctly determine the minimal number of cards required by leveraging basic arithmetic operations and properties of integer division.",
