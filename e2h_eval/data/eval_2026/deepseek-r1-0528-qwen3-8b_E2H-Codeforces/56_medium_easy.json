Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers R and B (number of rebels and bases) and then 2R+B points (R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases). We need to check if there exists a perfect matching (one-to-one assignment) between the R rebels and the B bases such that the straight line segments connecting each base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths from a base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect\". Since we have R rebels and B bases, and we require a perfect matching, we must have R = B? Actually, the problem says: \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\" -> so it's a bijection. Therefore, we require R == B. Otherwise, we cannot have a perfect matching.\n\n But wait: the input constraints say 1<=R,B<=10. So we can have R != B. Then how is the perfect matching defined? The problem says: \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", meaning we are assigning all bases to spaceships and vice versa. So if R != B, then it's impossible. However, the example inputs have R==B.\n\n Let me read the problem again: \n   \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\"\n\n This implies that we are matching the set of bases (size B) with the set of spaceships (size R). For a perfect matching, we require |R| = |B|. Otherwise, we cannot assign one-to-one.\n\n Therefore, if R != B, then output 'No'.\n\n However, the example input format: \n   First line: \"3 3\"\n   Then three lines for rebels, then three lines for bases.\n\n But note: the second example input is: \"2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1\"\n\n Here, R=2, B=1 -> not equal, so no perfect matching. Therefore, we output 'No'.\n\n But wait, what if R < B? Then we cannot cover all bases? Similarly, if R > B, we cannot assign each spaceship to a base. So indeed, we must have R == B.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read the first line to get R and B.\n 2. If R != B, output 'No' and exit.\n 3. Then read the next R lines for rebels, then the next B lines for bases.\n\n However, the problem says: \n   \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\"\n\n And the example input is provided as two separate examples.\n\n But note: the example input is given as:\n   ['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n So the program should handle two test cases? Actually, the problem statement says:\n\n   Input:\n     The first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases.\n\n This implies one test case. But the example input shows two test cases in a list. However, the problem says \"output\" for the example: ['Yes', 'No'].\n\n Clarification: The problem might be expecting multiple test cases? Or is the example input representation just a list of strings?\n\n Actually, the problem statement does not specify multiple test cases. It says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then describes one test case.\n\n But the example input is given as two strings in a list. So perhaps the entire input is provided as a single string? Or maybe the problem expects to read from stdin until EOF?\n\n Since the constraints are small (R, B up to 10), and the total points are at most 20, we can assume that the input is provided as described.\n\n However, note: the example input is provided in two separate examples. In the competition, the input would come from standard input.\n\n Let's re-read the example:\n\n   Example Input:\n        ['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n   Output:\n        ['Yes', 'No']\n\n This suggests that the input may consist of multiple test cases. But the problem statement doesn't explicitly say that.\n\n Alternatively, the example input is two separate test cases, and the program should output the answer for each.\n\n How to handle?\n\n Since the problem statement does not specify multiple test cases, but the example input is given as two strings, we can assume that the input may contain multiple test cases. However, looking at the constraints (R, B up to 10) and the fact that the total number of points is small, we can read until EOF.\n\n But the problem says: \"The first line contains two space-separated integers R, B\", so each test case starts with R and B.\n\n Approach:\n\n   We'll read the entire input and split into test cases.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and the input format is as described.\n\n   Since the example input is provided as a list of two strings, we might be expected to process two test cases.\n\n   But note: the problem statement says \"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\n   We don't know the exact input format. But the example input is given as two strings. However, in competitive programming, the input is usually provided from stdin and may have multiple test cases.\n\n   Let's assume the input has multiple test cases, separated by the first line (which gives R and B) and then the points.\n\n   How to read? We can read until EOF.\n\n   Steps for one test case:\n\n     1. Read R and B.\n     2. If R != B, then output 'No' and move to the next test case (if any).\n     3. Else, read the next R+B lines (R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases).\n\n   But wait: the problem says the rebels are given first, then the bases. And the rebels are R lines, bases B lines.\n\n   However, the example input: \n        \"3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2\"\n\n   Then the next test case: \n        \"2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1\"\n\n   So we can read the first integer R, then the next R lines (for rebels) and then the next B lines (for bases). Then we process.\n\n   But note: the input may have multiple test cases without any separation (like a sequence of test cases until EOF).\n\n   Since the constraints are small (at most 10 for R, B, and 20 points per test case), we can do:\n\n        while True:\n            try:\n                first_line = input().split()\n                if not first_line:\n                    continue\n                R = int(first_line[0])\n                B = int(first_line[1])\n                # Then read R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases\n                rebels = []\n                for i in range(R):\n                    data = input().split()\n                    x = int(data[0]); y = int(data[1])\n                    rebels.append((x, y))\n                bases = []\n                for i in range(B):\n                    data = input().split()\n                    x = int(data[0]); y = int(data[1])\n                    bases.append((x, y))\n\n                # Now, if R != B: print 'No'\n                if R != B:\n                    print('No')\n                else:\n                    # We have a set of rebels and bases, both of size n = R = B.\n                    n = R\n                    # We need to check if there is a perfect matching (bijection) between rebels and bases such that the segments connecting each base to a rebel do not cross.\n\n                    # Note: the condition is that the straight paths (segments) do not intersect.\n\n                    # However, note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect\".\n\n                    # This is a non-crossing matching condition.\n\n                    # Observation: the entire set of points (rebels and bases) must form a planar graph (with edges being the matching) and the edges must not cross.\n\n                    # But note: the problem does not require the entire set of points to be matched arbitrarily. We are allowed to choose which rebel goes to which base.\n\n                    # There is a known way to check for non-crossing matchings: \n\n                    # One idea: sort the points (both rebels and bases) in a certain order. However, note that the problem does not specify the positions.\n\n                    # Another idea: use the fact that if we consider the entire set of points (all rebels and bases) and we want to connect them with non-crossing edges, then the matching must be non-crossing.\n\n                    # But note: the problem does not require the matching to be non-crossing only when drawn in the plane, but the segments must not intersect.\n\n                    # How to check for a perfect matching with non-intersecting edges?\n\n                    # We can use a recursive backtracking? But n is at most 10, so 10! = 3628800 which is acceptable in worst-case for a backtracking algorithm? However, we have to check the crossing condition for each matching.\n\n                    # However, we can also use a more efficient method: \n\n                    # There is a known theorem: a set of non-crossing edges can be found if the graph is planar and we are looking for a matching. But here, we are only allowed to connect rebels to bases.\n\n                    # Another idea: fix an ordering. Consider that the entire set of points (both rebels and bases) can be sorted by x-coordinate (and then by y if tie). Then, we can use a greedy matching? Not exactly.\n\n                    # Actually, we can use the following:\n\n                    # Step 1: Check if the set of points (rebels and bases) can be connected by non-crossing edges. But note: the problem does not require that the entire set of edges (matching) forms a planar embedding, but that the edges do not cross.\n\n                    # We can use the following approach:\n\n                    #   Sort all the points (rebels and bases) by x-coordinate (and if tie, by y-coordinate). Then, we can use a recursive method to match the leftmost point to one of the remaining, and then remove those and recurse. However, we must ensure that the edges do not cross.\n\n                    # But note: the problem does not require the matching to be a planar embedding of the entire set, but the edges must not intersect. And the edges are from rebels to bases.\n\n                    # However, the condition for non-crossing edges in a set of points is that the matching is non-crossing. There is a known algorithm for non-crossing matching in points.\n\n                    # But note: the problem does not require that the matching is non-crossing for the entire set of edges arbitrarily, but specifically that the edges (from base to rebel) do not intersect.\n\n                    # We can use the following:\n\n                    #   Consider the entire set of points (n rebels and n bases) and try to match them so that the edges do not cross.\n\n                    #   One necessary condition: the matching must be non-crossing. We can check a candidate matching by verifying that for every four points (a,b,c,d) that are connected by edges (a->b and c->d) and that the two edges do not cross.\n\n                    #   How to check two segments (p1, p2) and (p3, p4) for intersection? We can use the standard orientation test (cross product).\n\n                    #   However, note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" meaning that no two edges should intersect. So the entire matching must be non-crossing.\n\n                    #   Algorithm for checking non-crossing matching:\n\n                    #       We can fix the order of the points (say, by x-coordinate) and then use a recursive backtracking that tries to match the leftmost point to one of the available points and then checks that the edge from the leftmost to the chosen does not cross any existing edge (but initially none). Then we remove these two and continue.\n\n                    #       However, note: the entire matching must be non-crossing. The key observation is that if we have two edges (A-B and C-D) then they do not cross if and only if the points are in alternating order in the matching. But actually, we can use the following:\n\n                    #       Let the entire set of points (including rebels and bases) be sorted by x, then by y. Then, we can use the following:\n\n                    #           Sort all points by x, and if two points have the same x, by y.\n\n                    #           Then, we can use a DP or a greedy method: \n\n                    #       Actually, there is a known result: if we have two sets of points (say red and blue) and we wish to connect each red to a blue without crossing, then one way is to sort by x and then match in increasing order of y? \n\n                    #       But note: the problem does not specify which set is which. We have two sets: rebels and bases.\n\n                    #       However, the problem does not require that the matching is between two sets in a particular way, but just that the edges (from base to rebel) do not cross.\n\n                    #       Another known idea: draw a complete bipartite graph between the two sets and then check for a non-crossing matching.\n\n                    #       We can use the following:\n\n                    #         Sort the rebels and bases separately by x. Then, we can try to match the rebels in increasing x to bases in increasing x. But that might not be sufficient.\n\n                    #       Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n                    #         Sort all points (both rebels and bases) by x, and if two points have the same x, by y. Then, we can try to assign the rebels and bases in that order. However, we don't know which points are rebels and which are bases.\n\n                    #       We need to remember the type (rebel or base) of each point.\n\n                    #       Steps for one test case (when R==B):\n\n                    #         Let n = R = B.\n                    #         Combine the rebels and bases into one list of points, and mark each point as 'r' or 'b'. Then, sort by x, and then by y.\n\n                    #         Now, we need to assign the rebels to bases such that the edges (from base to rebel) do not cross.\n\n                    #         We can use a recursive function that takes the current list of unmatched rebels and bases (or the entire list and a set of matched indices) and tries to match the leftmost unmatched point (by x) to one of the unmatched points (of opposite type) and then check that the edge does not cross any existing edge. But this is complicated.\n\n                    #       Alternatively, we can use the following theorem: \n\n                    #         A set of non-crossing edges in a bipartite graph (with two sets of points) is possible if and only if the bipartite graph is planar and we can embed it without crossings. But we are given the points in the plane.\n\n                    #       However, note that we are allowed to connect any rebel to any base. The condition for non-crossing is purely geometric.\n\n                    #       We can use the following greedy:\n\n                    #         Sort the rebels by x, and the bases by x. Then, we can try to match the rebels in increasing x to bases in increasing x. Then, check if the entire set of edges (the matching) is non-crossing.\n\n                    #         But wait: what if we have two rebels: r1, r2 (with r1.x < r2.x) and two bases: b1, b2 (with b1.x < b2.x). Then we have two matchings:\n\n                    #             Matching 1: r1->b1, r2->b2: then the edges are (r1b1) and (r2b2). They do not cross if the entire set of points is in convex position?

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between a set of Rebel spaceships and bases such that the straight-line segments connecting each spaceship to its assigned base do not intersect. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of assignments between the spaceships and bases to see if any permutation results in non-intersecting segments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires checking for a perfect matching (one-to-one assignment) between R spaceships and B bases where R must equal B for a perfect matching to exist. If R ≠ B, the answer is immediately \"No\".\n2. **Key Insight**: For a given matching (a permutation where each spaceship is assigned to a unique base), the segments connecting each spaceship to its base must not intersect. This can be checked by verifying that no two segments cross each other.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Check for R = B**: If not, output \"No\".\n   - **Generate Permutations**: For each permutation of base assignments, check if all segments formed by connecting each spaceship to its assigned base do not intersect.\n   - **Segment Intersection Check**: Use the cross product method to determine if two line segments intersect. For each pair of segments in the current permutation, verify they do not intersect.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The number of permutations is n! (factorial of n), where n is up to 10 (since R, B ≤ 10). 10! is 3,628,800, which is computationally feasible for modern systems.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    idx = 0\n    results = []\n    \n    while idx < len(data):\n        R = int(data[idx]); B = int(data[idx+1]); idx += 2\n        rebels = []\n        for _ in range(R):\n            x = int(data[idx]); y = int(data[idx+1]); idx += 2\n            rebels.append((x, y))\n        bases = []\n        for _ in range(B):\n            x = int(data[idx]); y = int(data[idx+1]); idx += 2\n            bases.append((x, y))\n            \n        if R != B:\n            results.append(\"No\")\n            continue\n            \n        n = R\n        bases_list = bases\n        \n        def ccw(A, B, C):\n            return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n        \n        def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n            o1 = ccw(a, b, c)\n            o2 = ccw(a, b, d)\n            o3 = ccw(c, d, a)\n            o4 = ccw(c, d, b)\n            \n            if ((o1 * o2) < 0) and ((o3 * o4) < 0):\n                return True\n                \n            if o1 == 0 or o2 == 0 or o3 == 0 or o4 == 0:\n                return True\n                \n            return False\n        \n        found = False\n        for perm in itertools.permutations(range(n)):\n            valid = True\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(i+1, n):\n                    seg1 = (rebels[i], bases_list[perm[i]])\n                    seg2 = (rebels[j], bases_list[perm[j]])\n                    if segments_intersect(seg1[0], seg1[1], seg2[0], seg2[1]):\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                if not valid:\n                    break\n            if valid:\n                found = True\n                break\n                \n        results.append(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n        \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first two values are R (number of spaceships) and B (number of bases). Subsequent lines provide coordinates for spaceships followed by bases.\n2. **Perfect Matching Check**: If R ≠ B, the answer is \"No\" since a perfect matching is impossible. Otherwise, proceed to check all permutations of base assignments.\n3. **Cross Product and Segment Intersection**: The `ccw` function checks the orientation of three points to determine if they form a counter-clockwise triangle. The `segments_intersect` function uses these orientations to check if two line segments intersect.\n4. **Permutation Check**: For each permutation (assignment of bases to spaceships), the code checks all pairs of segments to ensure none intersect. If any permutation satisfies this condition, the answer is \"Yes\"; otherwise, it's \"No\".\n5. **Output**: Results for each test case (if multiple) are printed at the end.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible matchings while leveraging geometric properties to ensure correctness, making it suitable for the given problem constraints.",
