Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\n We are given two points (home and university) and a set of n lines (roads). The roads divide the plane into blocks. We can move from one block to another if they share a common border of nonzero length. This is equivalent to crossing one road at a time (because the borders are segments of the roads).\n\n However, note: the movement is defined by crossing roads. The key observation is that the entire plane is divided by the n lines. Each road is an infinite line.\n\n The problem states that we start in a block containing home and want to get to the block containing university.\n\n How do we model the blocks? Each road divides the plane into two half-planes. The block can be represented by a set of \"sides\" for each road (i.e., which side of the road the block lies on). Since the roads are linear, the entire arrangement of n lines divides the plane into regions that can be labeled by a binary string of length n (each road: + or - side).\n\n Now, note: moving from one block to an adjacent block requires crossing exactly one road. However, the problem says that we can only move if the common border has nonzero length. So we cannot cross two roads at once (unless they intersect, but then we are crossing one road at a time). Thus, the minimal steps are the number of roads we must cross to get from home to university.\n\n But wait: is it simply the number of roads that separate home and university?\n\n Actually, consider: each road has two sides. For each road, we can check on which side the home is and on which side the university is. If they are on opposite sides of a road, then that road must be crossed an odd number of times (at least once). \n\n However, note: when we cross a road, we change the side for that road. Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads for which home and university lie on opposite sides.\n\n But wait: what if multiple roads are crossed at the same time? Actually, the problem says that we can only move through a nonzero-length border. This implies that we cross one road at a time. Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n However, consider the example: \n Input 1: \n   '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0'\n\n This means:\n   Home: (1,1)\n   University: (-1,-1)\n   Roads: \n        Road1: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0  => y=0\n        Road2: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0  => x=0\n\n Then, we can represent the home (1,1): \n        For Road1: y=1 -> 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 > 0 -> so we can define the sign as positive (or negative) arbitrarily, but we need consistency.\n\n Let's define for a road aix+biy+ci=0, the side of a point (x,y) by the sign of (a*x+b*y+c). Since the line equation is defined up to a scalar multiple, we can fix the sign arbitrarily. However, we care about the relative side of home and university.\n\n Steps:\n   For each road i:\n        Let f_i(x,y) = a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i.\n        Compute s1 = f_i(x1, y1) and s2 = f_i(x2, y2).\n\n        If s1 and s2 have opposite signs (one positive, the other negative), then the road separates the two points and we must cross it.\n\n Therefore, the answer is the count of such roads.\n\n But wait: what if the two points are already in the same block? Then the answer is 0.\n\n Example 2: \n   Input: \n        '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3'\n\n   This means:\n        Home: (1,1)\n        University: (-1,-1)\n        Roads:\n            Road1: x = 0\n            Road2: y = 0\n            Road3: x+y-3=0\n\n        Check Road1: x=0 -> for (1,1): 1>0; for (-1,-1): -1<0 -> opposite, so count=1.\n        Road2: y=0 -> (1,1): 1>0; (-1,-1): -1<0 -> opposite, count=2.\n        Road3: x+y-3=0 -> (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 <0; (-1,-1): -1-1-3=-5 <",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing the university, given that the plane is divided by several infinite line roads. The key observation here is that each road divides the plane into two half-planes, and moving between blocks requires crossing these roads. The minimal number of steps corresponds to the number of roads that separate the home and university points.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves checking how many roads lie between the home and university points. Each road is defined by a linear equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\). For each road, we determine if the home and university lie on opposite sides of the road. If they do, this road must be crossed at least once, contributing to the minimal steps.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution hinges on evaluating the side of each road for both points. If the signs of the evaluated expressions differ (one positive and one negative), the road separates the two points, and thus must be crossed.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, compute the value of the linear expression \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) for both the home and university coordinates. If the results have opposite signs, increment the step count.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the \\(n\\) roads once, performing constant-time checks for each. Thus, the time complexity is \\(O(n)\\), which is efficient given the constraint \\(n \\leq 300\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    n = int(data[4])\n    index = 5\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0) or (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0):\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first four values are the coordinates of the home and university. The next value is the number of roads, followed by the coefficients of each road's equation.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the code evaluates the linear expression \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) at both the home and university coordinates.\n3. **Checking Sides**: If the evaluations yield results of opposite signs (one positive and one negative), it means the two points lie on different sides of the road, and thus the road must be crossed. The step count is incremented for each such road.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of such roads is printed, representing the minimal steps needed to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road once, leveraging simple arithmetic and comparison operations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
