    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\nWe are given two integers a and b (with 1 <= a, b <= 10^9). We need to find a non-negative integer k such that:\n   LCM(a+k, b+k) is minimized.\n\nNote: If multiple k yield the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\nLet d = (a+k) and e = (b+k). Then note that d - e = a - b (constant). So we are looking for k such that the LCM of two numbers that differ by a fixed amount (d = a-b) is minimized.\n\nWe can write:\n   Let g = gcd(a+k, b+k). Then LCM(a+k, b+k) = (a+k)*(b+k) / g.\n\nBut note that (a+k) and (b+k) are co-prime if we consider the gcd? Actually, no. The gcd must divide (a+k) - (b+k) = a-b. Therefore, the gcd must be a divisor of |a-b|.\n\nLet d0 = |a-b|. Then for any k, gcd(a+k, b+k) divides d0.\n\nIdea:\n   Let d0 = |a-b|. Without loss of generality, assume a >= b (if not, swap the roles, but note the problem doesn't require that).\n\nThen we have:\n   Let x = a+k, y = b+k, so x-y = a-b (which is positive if a>=b).\n   Then gcd(x,y) = gcd(x, x-y) = gcd(a+k, d0).\n\nSo the LCM is (x * y) / gcd(x,y) = (a+k)*(b+k) / gcd(a+k, d0)\n\nWe want to minimize this.\n\nNote: k is non-negative.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe know that the LCM is minimized when the product (a+k)*(b+k) is small, but also the denominator (gcd) is as large as possible. However, we cannot independently control these.\n\nBut note: the gcd must divide d0. Therefore, we can consider divisors of d0.\n\nHowever, note: k might be chosen such that (a+k) and (b+k) share a common divisor which divides d0. But also note that k might be chosen arbitrarily, so we have to consider all k that make the gcd larger.\n\nBut note: the problem constraints (a,b up to 10^9) and d0 can be up to 10^9, so we cannot iterate over all divisors and then test all k for each divisor because k would be determined by the condition that (a+k) is divisible by a divisor? Actually, we can consider:\n\nFor each divisor g of d0 (including negative? no, divisors are positive), we can set:\n   We require that g divides both (a+k) and (b+k). Since g divides d0, and d0 = a-b, then g divides (a+k) - (b+k) = a-b.\n\nThen, for a fixed divisor g (positive) of d0, we can set k such that:\n   k ≡ (-a) mod g   and   k ≡ (-b) mod g.\n\nBut note: since g divides (a-b), then the condition on k is that k ≡ (-a) mod g and k ≡ (-b) mod g. And these two conditions are consistent because (a-b) is divisible by g.\n\nSo for each divisor g of d0, we can define:\n   k_min(g) = the smallest non-negative k such that g divides (a+k) (and automatically (b+k)).\n\nActually, we can set k to be the smallest non-negative solution to:\n   k ≡ (-a) mod g   =>   k ≡ (g - a % g) mod g   [but careful: if a % g !=0, then we want the smallest k>=0 such that (a+k) % g == 0]\n\nBut note: we can also consider that k must be at least max(0, ...) but actually we can compute:\n\n   k0 = (ceil(a/g)*g - a)   if a % g !=0, then k0 = g - (a % g) unless a%g==0 then k0=0.\n\nBut wait: if a % g == 0, then k=0 is valid. Otherwise, k0 = g - (a % g). However, note that if we use k0, then (a+k0) is divisible by g, and similarly (b+k0) is divisible by g because g divides (a-b) and hence divides (a+k0) - (b+k0) = a-b.\n\nBut note: there is a catch. The divisor g must divide d0, but also we must consider that the gcd might be greater than g? Actually, we are considering that the gcd is at least g, but it could be a multiple of g? However, note that the gcd must divide d0, so it must be a divisor of d0. Therefore, we can consider all divisors (and their multiples?) but wait: the set of divisors is fixed.\n\nBut note: the gcd is a divisor of d0, so we only need to consider divisors of d0.\n\nHowever, note: the problem asks for the minimal LCM and then the smallest k. We can consider:\n\n   For each divisor g of d0 (both positive divisors), we can compute k0(g) = (the smallest non-negative k such that g divides (a+k)).\n\nThen, with k0(g), we have:\n   Let x = a + k0(g), y = b + k0(g)\n   Then the gcd is at least g. But note: the actual gcd might be a divisor of d0 that is a multiple of g? Actually, no: the gcd is the greatest common divisor. However, we don't know the exact gcd until we compute it. But note: the gcd must divide d0, and we are iterating over all divisors. However, we cannot assume that the gcd is exactly g.\n\nBut here's the key: we want to minimize the LCM. The LCM is (x*y)/gcd(x,y). The gcd(x,y) is at least g, so the LCM is at most (x*y)/g. However, the actual gcd might be greater than g, so we cannot just use g to compute the LCM.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that the gcd must be a divisor of d0, so we can iterate over all divisors of d0, and for each divisor g, we consider k0(g) (the smallest k such that g divides (a+k)), and then compute the actual gcd for that k0(g) (which is gcd(a+k0(g), b+k0(g))). Then, we compute the LCM and compare.\n\nBut note: the value of k0(g) is computed from g, and then we must consider that the same k might appear from multiple divisors. Also, we must consider k=0 separately? Actually, k=0 is included when g divides a and divides b (if a>=b, then g divides a and b).\n\nBut wait: what if d0=0? Then a==b. Then we have to handle separately.\n\nCase 1: a == b\n   Then d0 = 0. Then the two numbers are the same: a+k and b+k = a+k.\n   Then LCM(a+k, a+k) = a+k.\n   We want to minimize a+k. The smallest k is 0, then LCM = a (which is the same as b).\n\nCase 2: a != b\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Let d0 = abs(a-b). If d0==0, output 0.\n\n2. Factorize d0 to get all divisors? But d0 can be up to 10^9, so we can factorize in O(sqrt(d0)) which is acceptable.\n\n3. For each divisor g of d0 (including 1 and d0):\n      k0 = (g - a % g) % g   # This gives the smallest non-negative k such that (a+k) % g == 0.\n      But note: if a % g == 0, then k0=0. Otherwise, k0 = g - (a % g).\n\n   However, note: we must ensure that k0 is non-negative and minimal.\n\n4. But wait: there is a caveat. The above k0 ensures that (a+k0) is divisible by g. But does it also ensure that (b+k0) is divisible by g?\n   Yes, because g divides d0 (which is a-b), so (a-b) % g == 0. Then (a+k0) % g == 0 implies (b+k0) % g = (a+k0 - (a-b)) % g = (a+k0) % g - (a-b)%g = 0 - 0 = 0.\n\n5. Then, we can compute:\n        x = a + k0\n        y = b + k0\n        g_val = gcd(x, y)   # This will be at least g, but we don't know exactly. However, note that the gcd must divide d0, so it is a divisor of d0.\n\n   Then LCM = (x * y) // g_val\n\n6. Then we compare the LCM for different divisors and the corresponding k0.\n\n7. Additionally, we must consider that the minimal LCM might occur for k that is not necessarily the minimal k for a divisor? Actually, we are taking the minimal k for each divisor. But note: if we take a divisor g, we are getting one candidate k (the minimal k for which g divides both). However, note that if we take a larger divisor (say g') that is a divisor of d0 and g' divides (a+k0) and (b+k0), then we might have a better LCM (because the denominator g_val might be larger). But we are iterating over every divisor, so we will capture that.\n\n8. But note: the set of divisors includes all divisors. However, the candidate k0(g) is the minimal k that makes the numbers divisible by g. But note: there might be other k's that are not minimal for any divisor but still give a large gcd (maybe a divisor that is not considered because it is not a divisor of d0? No, because the gcd must divide d0). \n\nWait, the gcd must divide d0, so the divisors we are iterating over are exactly the possible gcds? Not exactly: the gcd might be a divisor of d0, but we are only considering the divisors that are factors of d0. However, we are iterating over all divisors, so we will cover all possible gcds.\n\nBut note: the same k0(g) might be generated by multiple divisors? Actually, no: k0(g) is defined by the condition that g divides (a+k). However, note that if two divisors g1 and g2 (both divisors of d0) lead to the same k0, then we are considering the same k twice. But that's okay because we are going to compare the LCM for that k only once (we can store by k and then pick the smallest k for the best LCM, but we are required to output the smallest k even if the LCM is the same).\n\nBut note: we are iterating over divisors and computing k0 for each divisor. Then we compute the LCM for that k0. Then we compare the LCMs and then choose the smallest k (if multiple k have the same LCM, we choose the smallest k). However, we must also consider that the minimal k might not be captured by any divisor? Actually, no: because the gcd must divide d0, so for any k, the gcd is a divisor of d0. Therefore, the k that minimizes the LCM must be one of the k0(g) for some divisor g.\n\nBut wait: consider k=0. Then the gcd is gcd(a,b). And gcd(a,b) divides d0 (because d0 = |a-b|, and gcd(a,b) divides any linear combination, including a-b). So k0(gcd(a,b)) should be 0? \n\nActually, if g = gcd(a,b), then we require that g divides a and b. Then k0(g) = 0. So k=0 is considered.\n\nBut note: there is an alternative way: we can also consider that the problem might be solved by iterating over divisors of d0 (which is |a-b|) and then for each divisor, compute the candidate k and the LCM, and then choose the candidate k that gives the minimal LCM, and if multiple then the smallest k.\n\nHowever, there is a catch: the divisor g must be positive and we consider all divisors (positive) of d0.\n\nBut note: the divisor g can be any divisor, including 1 (which always works) and d0 (the largest divisor). \n\nBut wait: what about divisors that are not positive? We only consider positive divisors.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Read a, b.\n\n2. If a == b, print 0 and exit.\n\n3. Let d0 = abs(a-b)\n\n4. Factorize d0 to get all divisors.\n\n5. Initialize:\n        best_lcm = a big number (like something > 10^30, or use None)\n        best_k = None\n\n6. For each divisor g in divisors of d0:\n        k0 = (g - a % g) % g   # This is the minimal k for which (a+k) is divisible by g.\n        # But note: if a % g == 0, then k0=0; else k0 = g - (a % g)\n\n        x = a + k0\n        y = b + k0\n\n        # Now, compute the gcd of x and y. But note: the gcd must divide d0, so we can compute it using Euclidean algorithm.\n\n        g_val = math.gcd(x, y)\n\n        # Then LCM = (x * y) // g_val\n\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // g_val\n\n        # Compare current_lcm with best_lcm:\n        if current_lcm < best_lcm or (current_lcm == best_lcm and k0 < best_k):\n            best_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k0\n\n        # But note: k0 is non-negative.\n\n7. Print best_k\n\nHowever, note: is it possible that the minimal k is not among the divisors? We argued that the gcd must divide d0, so the k that yields a particular gcd (which is a divisor of d0) is being considered. But wait: what if the minimal LCM occurs at a k that is not minimal for any divisor? Actually, no: because for any k, the gcd is a divisor of d0, so the k must be at least the minimal k for that divisor (or a multiple). However, note: the minimal k for a divisor g is k0(g). But if we take a k that is greater than k0(g) but still divisible by g, then the gcd might be at least g, but the LCM might be the same? Actually, the LCM depends on the entire numbers. However, we are only checking the minimal k for each divisor. \n\nBut note: the minimal k for a divisor g is the smallest k that makes the numbers divisible by g. For that k, the gcd is at least g, but it might be more (a divisor of d0 that is a multiple of g). However, we are iterating over all divisors, so we are covering all possibilities.\n\nBut wait: what if the minimal k for a divisor g is k0, and then we have a larger divisor h (which is a divisor of d0) that is a multiple of g, and k0 is also the minimal k for h? Then we would have two candidates: k0 for divisor g and k0 for divisor h. But note: if h is a multiple of g, then the condition for h is stronger. However, we are iterating over all divisors, so h is considered and k0(h) is computed. But note: k0(h) might be less than or equal to k0(g)? Actually, no: because the minimal k for a larger divisor (in terms of divisibility) is not necessarily larger.\n\nExample: \n   a=6, b=10, d0=4. Divisors: 1,2,4.\n\n   For g=1: k0 = (1 - 6%1) % 1 -> 0 (because 6%1 is 0, so k0=0)\n        x=6, y=10, gcd(6,10)=2, LCM=30.\n\n   For g=2: k0 = (2-6%2)%2 -> (2-0)%2=0\n        x=6,y=10, same as above -> LCM=30.\n\n   For g=4: k0 = (4-6%4)%4 = (4-2)%4 = 2\n        x=8, y=12, gcd(8,12)=4, LCM=(8*12)//4=24.\n\nSo we found k=2 gives LCM=24, which is better.\n\nBut note: the divisor 4 is considered and gives k0=2. Then we compare and 24 is better than 30, so we choose k=2.\n\nBut wait: what if we consider k=1? Then we have (7,11) -> gcd(7,11)=1, LCM=77, worse.\n\nk=2: (8,12): LCM=24.\n\nk=3: (9,13): gcd=1, LCM=117.\n\nk=4: (10,14): gcd=2, LCM=70.\n\nSo indeed, k=2 is the best.\n\nBut note: our method only considers k0 for divisors. Why did we not consider k=0? We did: k=0 is considered for divisors 1 and 2. But the LCM for k=0 was 30, which is not the minimal.\n\nSo the method is correct.\n\nHowever, note: the divisor set we iterate over must include all divisors (positive) of d0.\n\nBut wait: what if d0 is very large (up to 10^9)? The number of divisors is at most around 1300 (for highly composite numbers). So we can factorize d0 and then generate all divisors.\n\nSteps for generating divisors:\n\n   Factorize d0 (if d0==0, handled separately) then use the exponents to generate all divisors.\n\nBut note: d0 can be 0, but we already handled a==b.\n\nImplementation:\n\n   Step 1: Read a, b.\n\n   Step 2: If a==b: print(0); return.\n\n   Step 3: d0 = abs(a-b)\n\n   Step 4: Factorize d0.\n\n   Step 5: Generate all divisors.\n\n   Step 6: Iterate over divisors.\n\nBut note: we must consider that k0(g) must be non-negative and minimal.\n\nHowever, there is one more thing: the divisor g must be positive. Our divisors are positive.\n\nBut wait: what if a or b is negative? The problem states a, b are at least 1, so non-negative and at least 1.\n\nBut wait: the input says 1<=a,b<=10^9, so they are positive.\n\nAnother issue: the LCM computation (x*y) might be very large (since a,b up to 10^9, then x and y can be up to 10^9+10^9=2e9, so the product is 4e18, which is within Python int, but we have to be cautious because we are dividing by g_val (which is at least 1). However, the problem requires minimal LCM, and we are comparing these big numbers.\n\nBut note: the problem says that if multiple k yield the same LCM, we choose the smallest k.\n\nBut there is an alternative: we must consider that the same k might be generated by multiple divisors. Then we might update the same k multiple times. But that's okay because we are storing the best LCM and the smallest k for that LCM.\n\nHowever, we are iterating over divisors and updating with k0(g). But note: k0(g) is the minimal k for divisor g. But the same k might be the minimal k for multiple divisors. Then we are computing the same k multiple times. But that's acceptable because the LCM for a given k is fixed.\n\nBut note: we are storing the best LCM and the smallest k that achieves it. However, we are updating even if we get the same k again with the same LCM? Actually, no: because we are iterating and if we get the same k again, then the LCM is the same, but we are storing the smallest k. However, if we get the same k again, then the LCM must be the same (since k is the same, so x and y are the same). So we don't need to worry.\n\nBut wait: what if two different divisors g1 and g2 yield the same k0? Then we are computing the same (x,y) and same LCM. Then the update condition: if the LCM is the same and k0 is the same, then we don't change best_k (because we are storing the smallest k, and we are seeing the same k). But if we get the same k0 from two divisors, then we are updating with the same k0 and same LCM, so no change.\n\nBut note: the same k0 can be obtained from two divisors? \n   Condition: k0 = (g - a%g) % g. \n   For two divisors g1 and g2, we have:\n        (a+k0) % g1 == 0 and (a+k0) % g2 == 0.\n\n   Then k0 must be such that (a+k0) is divisible by both g1 and g2, i.e., by lcm(g1,g2). But note: g1 and g2 are divisors of d0, and d0 is fixed. However, the minimal k0 for each divisor is independent.\n\nBut note: the minimal k0 for g1 is k0(g1), and for g2 is k0(g2). They are computed independently. It is possible that k0(g1) = k0(g2) even if g1 != g2.\n\nExample: a=8, b=12, d0=4. Divisors: 1,2,4.\n\n   g=1: k0 = (1-8%1)%1 -> 0 (because 8%1=0)\n   g=2: k0 = (2-8%2)%2 -> 0\n   g=4: k0 = (4-8%4)%4 -> (4-0)%4=0\n\nSo for a=8, b=12, we get k0=0 for all divisors.\n\nThen we compute for k0=0: x=8, y=12, gcd=4, LCM=(8*12)//4=24.\n\nBut note: k=0 is the candidate.\n\nBut wait, what about k=0? It is the minimal k. Then we output 0.\n\nBut note: the example input ['6 10', '21 31', '5 10'].\n\n   Example: \"6 10\" -> output 2.\n\n   Example: \"21 31\" -> output 9.\n\n   Example: \"5 10\" -> output 0.\n\nWait, let me check \"5 10\": \n   a=5, b=10, d0=5. Divisors: 1,5.\n\n   g=1: k0=0 -> x=5, y=10, gcd=5, LCM=(5*10)//5=10.\n   g=5: k0= (5-5%5)%5 = (5-0)%5=0 -> same.\n\n   Then best LCM=10, best_k=0.\n\n   But wait, is that correct? \n        k=0: LCM(5,10)=10.\n\n        k=1: LCM(6,11)=66.\n        k=2: LCM(7,12)=84.\n        k=3: LCM(8,13)=104.\n        k=4: LCM(9,14)=126.\n\n   So yes, k=0 is best.\n\nBut the example input \"5 10\" is provided and expected output is 0.\n\nNow, \"21 31\": \n   a=21, b=31, d0=10. Divisors: 1,2,5,10.\n\n   k0 for g=1: 0 -> (21,31): gcd(21,31)=1, LCM=21*31=651.\n   g=2: k0 = (2-21%2)%2 = (2-1)%2=1 -> (22,32): gcd(22,32)=2, LCM=(22*32)//2= 352.\n   g=5: k0 = (5-21%5)%5 = (5-1)%5=4 -> (25,35): gcd(25,35)=5, LCM=(25*35)//5=175.\n   g=10: k0 = (10-21%10)%10 = (10-1)%10=9 -> (30,40): gcd(30,40)=10, LCM=(30*40)//10=120.\n\n   Then the minimal LCM is 120 (from k=9). So output 9.\n\nBut wait, is there a k that gives LCM less than 120? \n   k=0: LCM=651\n   k=1: LCM(22,32)=352\n   k=2: LCM(23,33)= gcd(23,33)=1 -> 23*33=759\n   k=3: LCM(24,34)= gcd(24,34)=2 -> (24*34)//2=408\n   k=4: LCM(25,35)=175\n   k=5: LCM(26,36)= gcd(26,36)=2 -> (26*36)//2=468\n   k=6: LCM(27,37)= gcd(27,37)=1 -> 27*37=999\n   k=7: LCM(28,38)= gcd(28,38)=2 -> (28*38)//2=532\n   k=8: LCM(29,39)= gcd(29,39)=1 -> 29*39=1131\n   k=9: LCM=120.\n\nSo indeed, k=9 is the best.\n\nBut note: the divisor method found k=9 for divisor 10, and then the LCM=120 is the minimal.\n\nHowever, note that the divisor 5 gave k=4 and LCM=175, which is worse than 120.\n\nBut wait: the divisor 10 is the largest divisor, so we are getting the largest gcd (10) and the LCM is minimized.\n\nBut note: the divisor 10 is the entire d0. \n\nBut why didn't we get a lower LCM with a divisor that is not the entire d0? Because the product (a+k)*(b+k) is minimized when the numbers are closer, but note: k=9 makes the numbers 30 and 40, which are closer than 25 and 35 (which are 25 and 35: difference 10, same as 30 and 40: difference 10). However, the product for 30 and 40 is 1200, and for 25 and 35 is 875, but wait: 875 is less than 1200? Then why the LCM is 120 for 30,40 and 175 for 25,35? \n\nWait, LCM is (product)/gcd. For 25,35: gcd=5, so LCM= (25*35)//5 = 175. For 30,40: gcd=10, so LCM= (30*40)//10=120. \n\nEven though the product 30*40=1200 is greater than 25*35=875, the gcd is larger (10 vs 5) so the LCM is smaller.\n\nSo the method is correct.\n\nBut note: the divisor method only considers divisors of d0. In this case, d0=10, so divisors are 1,2,5,10.\n\nNow, one more example: \"6 10\", d0=4, divisors=[1,2,4]. We found k=2 for divisor 4, and that gave LCM=24.\n\nBut wait: is there a divisor we missed? No.\n\nBut note: what if we consider divisors that are not positive? The problem says divisors, and we consider positive divisors.\n\nBut note: the divisor must be positive because gcd is positive.\n\nOne more corner: d0=1. Then divisors=[1]. Then k0= (1 - a%1)%1 -> 0. Then we compute the LCM for k0=0.\n\nExample: a=1, b=2 (d0=1). Then k0=0: x=1, y=2, gcd=1, LCM=2.\n\nBut is that minimal? \n   k=0: LCM=2\n   k=1: LCM(2,3)=6\n   k=2: LCM(3,4)=12\n\nSo 0 is correct.\n\nBut note: the problem says a, b>=1, so no negative.\n\nBut note: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers: but our a and b are positive.\n\nBut wait: the expression (g - a % g) % g: \n   In Python, a % g is always non-negative and less than g. So (a % g) is in [0, g-1]. Then (g - a % g) is in [1, g] (if a%g !=0) or 0 (if a%g==0). Then (g - a % g) % g: \n        if a%g==0, then (g - a%g)=g, then g % g =0 -> k0=0, which is correct.\n        if a%g !=0, then (g - a%g) is between 1 and g-1, so modulo g is itself.\n\nBut wait: what if a % g ==0? Then (g - a%g) = g, and then g % g is 0. So k0=0.\n\nAlternatively, we can write: \n   k0 = (g - a % g) % g\n\nBut note: if a % g ==0, then (g - a%g) = g, and then g % g =0, so that's correct.\n\nBut we can also write without modulus: \n   if a % g == 0:\n        k0 = 0\n   else:\n        k0 = g - (a % g)\n\nThis is equivalent.\n\nBut note: the modulus operation is safe.\n\nHowever, the above method has a potential issue: the divisor g must be positive, which it is.\n\nBut note: the divisor g can be 1, then k0=0.\n\nBut wait: what if d0=0? We already handled a==b.\n\nComplexity: factorizing d0 (up to 10^9) is O(sqrt(d0)) which is about 10^4.5, which is acceptable in Python.\n\nBut note: worst-case d0 is a prime number, then the divisors are 1 and d0. Then we only do two iterations.\n\nSteps:\n\n   import math\n\n   def factorize(n):\n        # returns a set of divisors\n\n   Alternatively, we can generate divisors from prime factors.\n\nBut note: we don't need the factorization per se, we need the divisors.\n\nWe can do:\n\n   def get_divisors(n):\n        # n is positive integer\n        divisors = set()\n        i = 1\n        while i*i <= n:\n            if n % i == 0:\n                divisors.add(i)\n                divisors.add(n//i)\n            i += 1\n        return divisors\n\nThen, for each divisor in divisors, we do the computation.\n\nBut note: d0 can be up to 10^9, then the loop goes up to sqrt(d0) (about 31622) which is acceptable.\n\nHowever, we must consider that the number of divisors is O(sqrt(d0)) but the generation is efficient.\n\nBut note: the input a and b can be up to 10^9, so d0 is up to 10^9.\n\nBut the divisor generation for numbers up to 10^9 is acceptable because the inner loop runs about 31622 times.\n\nBut wait: worst-case is when d0 is a highly composite number, but the divisor generation is still O(sqrt(d0)).\n\nNow, let's code accordingly.\n\nHowever, note: we must avoid duplicate divisors? Our set takes care.\n\nEdge: if d0=0, we handled by a==b.\n\nBut wait: what if a and b are swapped? Our method uses absolute value, so d0 is positive.\n\nBut note: the divisor generation function: we assume n>=1.\n\nBut wait: if d0=0, we handled separately. So in the divisor generation, n=d0>=1.\n\nBut note: if a==b, we print 0 and exit.\n\nBut wait: what if a==b? Then d0=0. Then we skip the divisor part.\n\nBut note: the problem says a, b>=1, so a==b is allowed.\n\nCode:\n\n   import math\n\n   def main():\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data:\n            return\n        a = int(data[0])\n        b = int(data[1])\n\n        if a == b:\n            print(0)\n            return\n\n        d0 = abs(a - b)\n\n        # Get all divisors of d0\n        divisors = set()\n        i = 1\n        # We'll iterate up to sqrt(d0)\n        while i * i <= d0:\n            if d0 % i == 0:\n                divisors.add(i)\n                divisors.add(d0 // i)\n            i += 1\n\n        best_k = None\n        best_lcm = None\n\n        for g in divisors:\n            # Compute k0: minimal non-negative k such that (a+k) % g == 0\n            remainder = a % g\n            if remainder == 0:\n                k0 = 0\n            else:\n                k0 = g - remainder\n\n            # Now, we have k0, then the numbers are a+k0 and b+k0.\n            x = a + k0\n            y = b + k0\n            g_val = math.gcd(x, y)\n            current_lcm = (x * y) // g_val\n\n            # Now, we compare\n            if best_lcm is None or current_lcm < best_lcm or (current_lcm == best_lcm and k0 < best_k):\n                best_lcm = current_lcm\n                best_k = k0\n\n        print(best_k)\n\nBut wait: is this sufficient?\n\nLet me test with the examples.\n\nExample 1: \"6 10\"\n   a=6, b=10, d0=4, divisors={1,2,4}\n   g=1: k0=0, x=6,y=10, gcd=2, LCM= (6*10)//2=30 -> best_k=0, best_lcm=30.\n   g=2: k0=0, same as above -> same, so no update.\n   g=4: k0= (4-6%4)=4-2=2, x=8,y=12, gcd=4, LCM=24 -> update best_k=2, best_lcm=24.\n\n   Output: 2.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find a non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If multiple values of \\( k \\) yield the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the difference between \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) remains constant (\\( |a - b| \\)). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) must be a divisor of this difference. Therefore, we can leverage the divisors of \\( |a - b| \\) to determine potential values of \\( k \\) that could minimize the LCM.\n\n2. **Insight**: For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( |a - b| \\), compute the smallest \\( k \\) such that both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) are divisible by \\( g \\). This \\( k \\) ensures that the GCD of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is at least \\( g \\), which helps in minimizing the LCM.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Special Case Handling**: If \\( a \\) equals \\( b \\), the minimal LCM is achieved when \\( k = 0 \\).\n   - **Divisor Enumeration**: For \\( a \\neq b \\), compute all divisors of \\( |a - b| \\).\n   - **Candidate Evaluation**: For each divisor \\( g \\), compute the minimal \\( k \\) that makes both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) divisible by \\( g \\). Then, calculate the LCM for these values and keep track of the minimal LCM encountered, along with the smallest \\( k \\) that achieves it.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The most computationally intensive part is generating all divisors of \\( |a - b| \\), which takes \\( O(\\sqrt{d}) \\) time where \\( d = |a - b| \\). Given the constraints \\( 1 \\leq a, b \\leq 10^9 \\), \\( d \\) can be up to \\( 10^9 \\), making the divisor generation feasible since \\( \\sqrt{10^9} \\approx 31622 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    d0 = abs(a - b)\n    divisors = set()\n    i = 1\n    while i * i <= d0:\n        if d0 % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(d0 // i)\n        i += 1\n        \n    best_k = None\n    best_lcm = None\n    \n    for g in divisors:\n        remainder = a % g\n        if remainder == 0:\n            k0 = 0\n        else:\n            k0 = g - remainder\n            \n        x = a + k0\n        y = b + k0\n        g_val = math.gcd(x, y)\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // g_val\n        \n        if best_lcm is None or current_lcm < best_lcm or (current_lcm == best_lcm and k0 < best_k):\n            best_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k0\n            \n    print(best_k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). If they are equal, it immediately outputs \\( 0 \\) since the LCM of any number with itself is the number itself, and \\( k = 0 \\) is the smallest non-negative integer.\n2. **Divisor Calculation**: For \\( a \\neq b \\), the code calculates all divisors of \\( |a - b| \\) by iterating up to the square root of \\( |a - b| \\). Each divisor and its complement (if different) are added to a set to avoid duplicates.\n3. **Finding Minimal \\( k \\)**: For each divisor \\( g \\), the code computes the smallest \\( k \\) such that \\( a + k \\) is divisible by \\( g \\). This \\( k \\) ensures that \\( b + k \\) will also be divisible by \\( g \\) because \\( g \\) divides \\( |a - b| \\).\n4. **LCM Calculation**: For each candidate \\( k \\), the code calculates the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\). The minimal LCM encountered is tracked, and in case of ties, the smallest \\( k \\) is chosen.\n5. **Output**: The smallest \\( k \\) that minimizes the LCM is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space by leveraging divisors of the difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), ensuring optimal performance even for large values.",
