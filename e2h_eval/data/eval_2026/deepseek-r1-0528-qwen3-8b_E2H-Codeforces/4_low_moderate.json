The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given n (number of rounds), string A (Nikephoros's sequence) and string B (Polycarpus's sequence)\n Since n can be up to 2e9, we cannot simulate round by round.\n Instead, we can use the concept of cycles.\n\n Let m = len(A), k = len(B). The sequences repeat every m and k respectively.\n\n In each round i (0-indexed from 0 to n-1):\n   Nikephoros uses A[i % m]\n   Polycarpus uses B[i % k]\n\n We need to count:\n   losses for Nikephoros: when (A[i%m] beats B[i%k]) is false and not a draw? Actually, let's define:\n      Draw: when A[i%m] == B[i%k]\n      Otherwise, if the outcome is a win for Nikephoros, then no red spot for him (and one for Polycarpus).\n      If the outcome is a win for Polycarpus, then one red spot for Nikephororos.\n\n But note: the problem says the loser gets a red spot.\n\n So, we want to count:\n   red_spots_nikephoros = number of rounds where Polycarpus wins (i.e., when Polycarpus's item beats Nikephoros's item)\n   red_spots_poly = number of rounds where Nikephoros wins (i.e., when Nikephoros's item beats Polycarpus's item)\n\n However, note that in a round, if it's a draw, no one gets a spot.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We can break the n rounds into complete cycles of length LCM(m, k) and then a remainder.\n\n But note: the two sequences have different lengths. The combined cycle would be the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k.\n\n However, the LCM might be too large to iterate over (since m,k<=1000, then LCM(m,k) <= 1000*1000, which is 1e6, but n can be 2e9, so we cannot iterate over all rounds).\n\n Alternative approach: precompute the outcomes for one full period (of length L = LCM(m,k)) and then multiply by the number of full periods.\n\n But wait: the indices for A and B in the n-th round depend on i (which goes from 0 to n-1). In one full period, the pairs (i % m, i % k) will cover each residue class modulo m and k exactly once? Actually, the set of pairs (x,y) such that x runs through residues mod m and y runs through residues mod k, but with the condition that (x,y) appears exactly once in a period of length LCM(m,k). \n\n However, note: the round index i runs consecutively. The pair (i % m, i % k) has the property that the sequence of pairs is periodic with period LCM(m,k). And within one period, each residue x in [0, m-1] and each residue y in [0, k-1] appears together exactly once? Actually, no: because the mapping i -> (i % m, i % k) is such that the condition for two indices i and j to yield the same pair is that i ≡ j (mod m) and i ≡ j (mod k). Then by Chinese Remainder Theorem, the period is LCM(m,k). And in one period, each pair (x,y) with x in [0, m-1] and y in [0, k-1] appears exactly once? Not necessarily: actually, the condition for a fixed pair (x,y) to appear is that i ≡ x (mod m) and i ≡ y (mod k). This equation has a solution if and only if x ≡ y (mod gcd(m,k)). But even then, the entire set of pairs (x,y) that satisfy x ≡ y (mod g) (where g = gcd(m,k)) will appear exactly once per period. \n\n However, we don't need to worry about the mathematical details. We can simply consider that the entire sequence of pairs (i % m, i % k) for i from 0 to LCM(m,k)-1 will cover all pairs (x,y) that satisfy x ≡ y (mod g) exactly once. But note: the total number of distinct pairs is m * k, and the period is LCM(m,k) = m*k / gcd(m,k). So the number of pairs that appear is LCM(m,k) = m*k/gcd(m,k). This is less than or equal to m*k (if g=1, then they are all covered).\n\n But wait, actually the condition for a pair (x,y) to appear at some index i is that i",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The players follow a cyclic sequence of moves, and each round's outcome depends on their current moves. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results for a large number of rounds (up to 2·10^9) without simulating each round individually.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, each with their own sequence of moves. The sequences repeat cyclically. For each round, the outcome is determined by comparing the current moves of both players. The key observation is that the sequences repeat every `m` and `k` rounds respectively, where `m` and `k` are the lengths of the sequences. The combined cycle length is the least common multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k`.\n\n2. **Insight**: Instead of processing each of the `n` rounds one by one, we can leverage the periodic nature of the sequences. We calculate the outcomes for one full cycle (LCM of `m` and `k` rounds) and then multiply these results by the number of full cycles in `n` rounds. The remaining rounds (if any) are processed separately.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Cycle Detection**: Compute the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the cycle length.\n   - **Frequency Counting**: For each position in the cycle, count how many times Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus wins, or the round ends in a draw.\n   - **Scaling Results**: Multiply the counts from one cycle by the number of full cycles in `n` rounds. For the remaining rounds, simulate the outcomes directly.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach efficiently handles large `n` by breaking it down into cycles. The preprocessing step involves iterating over the cycle length (LCM of `m` and `k`), which is manageable since `m` and `k` are at most 1000. The overall complexity is O(n) in the worst case but optimized by cycle detection.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data: \n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A_str = data[1].strip()\n    B_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    m = len(A_str)\n    k = len(B_str)\n    \n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    L = (m * k) // g\n    \n    full_cycles = n // L\n    remainder = n % L\n    \n    win_nike_count = 0\n    win_poly_count = 0\n    draw_count = 0\n    \n    for i in range(L):\n        idx_a = i % m\n        idx_b = i % k\n        a_char = A_str[idx_a]\n        b_char = B_str[idx_b]\n        \n        if a_char == b_char:\n            draw_count += 1\n        else:\n            if (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'S') or \\\n               (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'P') or \\\n               (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'R'):\n                win_nike_count += 1\n            else:\n                win_poly_count += 1\n                \n    total_win_nike = win_nike_count * full_cycles\n    total_win_poly = win_poly_count * full_cycles\n    total_draw = draw_count * full_cycles\n    \n    rem_win_nike = 0\n    rem_win_poly = 0\n    rem_draw = 0\n    \n    for i in range(remainder):\n        idx_a = i % m\n        idx_b = i % k\n        a_char = A_str[idx_a]\n        b_char = B_str[idx_b]\n        \n        if a_char == b_char:\n            rem_draw += 1\n        else:\n            if (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'S') or \\\n               (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'P') or \\\n               (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'R'):\n                rem_win_nike += 1\n            else:\n                rem_win_poly += 1\n                \n    total_win_nike += rem_win_nike\n    total_win_poly += rem_win_poly\n    \n    red_spots_nike = total_win_poly\n    red_spots_poly = total_win_nike\n    \n    print(f\"{red_spots_nike} {red_spots_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences `A` (Nikephoros) and `B` (Polycarpus).\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of `A` and `B` determines the cycle length. This helps in breaking down the `n` rounds into full cycles and a remainder.\n3. **Cycle Processing**: For each position in the cycle, the code checks the outcome of the round (win for Nikephoros, win for Polycarpus, or draw) and counts these occurrences.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The counts from one full cycle are multiplied by the number of full cycles. The remaining rounds are processed individually to account for partial cycles.\n5. **Output**: The total red spots for both players are printed, where each player's red spots equal the number of wins by the opponent.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large values of `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
