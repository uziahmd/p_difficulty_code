Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, and then n lines of n characters each.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. All the letters on both diagonals must be the same (but note: the center is shared by both diagonals).\n 2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must be the same letter and different from the diagonal letter.\n\n However, note that the example: \n   Input: 3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw -> Output: YES\n   But: \n        w s w\n        s w s\n        w s w\n\n Here, the diagonals have 'w' (from top-left to bottom-right: w, w, w; and the other diagonal: w, w, w) and the non-diagonal are all 's'. \n\n Steps:\n 1. Read n.\n 2. Read the grid.\n\n Let's define:\n   Let `center_letter` be the letter that should be on the diagonals (which will be the same throughout the diagonals).\n   Let `other_letter` be the letter that should be in every non-diagonal cell.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from the diagonal ones.\n\n Approach:\n  - Traverse the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right): i.e., (i,i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n  - Traverse the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left): i.e., (i, n-1-i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\n But note: the center (at index [n//2][n//2]) is common to both diagonals. So we can check:\n\n Condition 1: All the letters on the two diagonals must be the same. However, wait: what if the diagonals have two different letters? Then it fails.\n\n Actually, the condition is: the entire diagonal (including the center) must be one letter, and the entire anti-diagonal (including the center) must be that same letter? Or is it that the two diagonals must have the same letter?\n\n The problem states: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". It does not say they must be the same as each other? But note: the center is common. So the entire diagonal (all the way) must be one letter, and the anti-diagonal must be one letter, and because the center is shared, the two diagonals must have the same letter at the center. Therefore, the entire two diagonals must be the same letter.\n\n So step 1: Check that all the letters on the main diagonal are the same, and all the letters on the anti-diagonal are the same, and these two sets are the same.\n\n However, let me read again: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". This means:\n   - In the main diagonal, every letter is the same (say, 'x').\n   - In the anti-diagonal, every letter is the same (say, 'x').\n\n But note: the center is common. So if the main diagonal has all 'x' and the anti-diagonal has all 'x', then the center is 'x' in both.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might allow the two diagonals to be two different letters? But wait, the center is common. So the center must be the same in both. Therefore, the entire main diagonal must be the same and the entire anti-diagonal must be the same, and the center being common forces that the two diagonals must be the same letter.\n\n So condition 1: There exists a letter `d` such that for every cell (i, j) on the main diagonal: grid[i][j] = d, and for every cell (i, j) on the anti-diagonal: grid[i][j] = d.\n\n Condition 2: For every cell not on either diagonal, the letter must be the same (call it `o`) and `o != d`.\n\n However, note: what if the diagonals are all 'x' and the rest are all 'o'? Then we have \"YES\".\n\n But what if the diagonals are all 'x' and the rest are not all the same? Then \"NO\".\n\n And what if the diagonals are not the same? Then \"NO\".\n\n How about: \n   Example: \n     3\n     www\n     mmm\n     www\n\n   The diagonals: \n        (0,0)='w', (1,1)='m', (2,2)='w' -> not the same.\n\n   So condition 1 fails.\n\n Implementation:\n\n Step 1: Extract the two diagonals and check they are uniform and the same.\n\n  Let d1 = set of letters on the main diagonal.\n  Let d2 = set of letters on the anti-diagonal.\n\n  If the main diagonal is not of length 1 and has more than one distinct letter, or the anti-diagonal does, then condition fails.\n\n  But actually, we can do:\n\n      diag1 = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n      diag2 = [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n\n  Then, we require that all elements in diag1 are the same, and all elements in diag2 are the same, and the common element (if any) is the same for both.\n\n  However, note: the center is included in both. So we can set:\n      d_letter = diag1[0]\n      Check that every element in diag1 is d_letter, and every element in diag2 is d_letter.\n\n Step 2: Check the rest of the grid.\n\n  We need to ensure that for every cell (i, j) that is not on the main diagonal and not on the anti-diagonal, the letter is the same and different from d_letter.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"all other squares\" (non-diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal ones.\n\n  However, what if there are two different letters in the non-diagonals? Then condition fails.\n\n  So:\n\n      other_letter = None\n      for i in range(n):\n          for j in range(n):\n              if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                  continue   # skip diagonal and anti-diagonal\n              else:\n                  if other_letter is None:\n                      other_letter = grid[i][j]\n                  elif grid[i][j] != other_letter:\n                      condition fails.\n\n      Also, we must check that other_letter != d_letter.\n\n  But note: what if the grid has no non-diagonal cells? Only when n=1, but n>=3 and odd.\n\n  However, we must also check that the entire non-diagonal part is the same.\n\n  Alternatively, we can:\n\n      non_diag_letters = []\n      for i in range(n):\n          for j in range(n):\n              if i != j and i+j != n-1:\n                  non_diag_letters.append(grid[i][j])\n\n      Then, if non_diag_letters is not empty, we can check:\n          set(non_diag_letters) should have only one element, and that element != d_letter.\n\n      But note: what if the grid has no non-diagonal? Actually, for n>=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\n  However, we can do:\n\n      if not non_diag_letters:\n          # This would be the case n=1, but n>=3, so we don't worry.\n\n  But note: we already checked the diagonals. Now, if the non_diag_letters are empty, then the grid is 1x1? Our n>=3, so skip.\n\n  Alternatively, we can break out early if we find a non-diagonal cell that is different from the first one we found, or if we find that the non-diagonal cell is the same as d_letter.\n\n  However, let's structure:\n\n      Step 1: Check the diagonals.\n          Let d = grid[0][0]\n          For i in range(n):\n              if grid[i][i] != d: return \"NO\"\n          For i in range(n):\n              if grid[i][n-1-i] != d: return \"NO\"\n\n      Step 2: Check the non-diagonals.\n          Let other = None\n          for i in range(n):\n              for j in range(n):\n                  if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                      continue\n                  if other is None:\n                      other = grid[i][j]\n                  else:\n                      if grid[i][j] != other:\n                          print(\"NO\")\n                          exit(0)\n          # Now, check that other is not None and other != d\n          if other is None:\n              # This means the grid is 1x1? But n>=3, so this shouldn't happen.\n              # But if n==1, then no non-diagonal. However, the problem says n>=3, so we assume there are non-diagonals.\n              # Actually, for n=1, the entire grid is diagonal. Then we have no non-diagonal. But the problem says n>=3, so we ignore.\n              # Since n>=3, we can assume other is not None.\n              pass\n\n          if other == d:\n              print(\"NO\")\n              exit(0)\n\n      Then, print(\"YES\")\n\n  But wait: what if the grid has two different letters in the non-diagonals? Then we catch that in the loop.\n\n  However, note: we are checking that every non-diagonal cell is the same. But we are setting `other` to the first non-diagonal cell, and then comparing every other non-diagonal cell to that.\n\n  But what if the grid has non-diagonal cells with two different letters? Then we will set `other` to the first one, and then when we see the second different one, we break and output \"NO\".\n\n  However, consider: \n        ['3', \n         'aba',\n         'cdc',\n         'aba']\n\n      Diagonals: \n          main: [a, c, a] -> not all the same (a, c, a) -> fails.\n\n  So we already check the diagonals. Therefore, the above example fails at the diagonal check.\n\n  Another example:\n\n        ['3',\n         'xxx',\n         'xox',\n         'xxx']\n\n      Diagonals: \n          main: [x, o, x] -> not uniform -> fails.\n\n  Therefore, the above approach for Step 1 must check that the entire main diagonal is the same and the entire anti-diagonal is the same.\n\n  However, note: we set d = grid[0][0] and then check the entire main diagonal. But what if the main diagonal is uniform but not starting with grid[0][0]? \n      Actually, we are using the first element as the reference. But if the main diagonal is uniform, then all are equal to grid[0][0]. Similarly for anti-diagonal.\n\n  But what if the main diagonal is uniform but the anti-diagonal is uniform but with a different letter? Then:\n\n      Example: \n          n=3\n          grid = [['a','b','a'],\n                  ['b','b','b'],\n                  ['a','b','a']]\n\n      Main diagonal: ['a','b','a'] -> not uniform (unless we consider: but wait, the main diagonal is [a, b, a] -> not all same). \n\n  Actually, the above example fails because the main diagonal is not uniform.\n\n  But what if we have:\n\n          n=3\n          grid = [['a','b','c'],\n                  ['d','e','f'],\n                  ['g','h','i']]\n\n      We want to check that the main diagonal (a,e,i) are the same. If they are, then set d = a, then check e==a and i==a. If they are, then proceed.\n\n  However, what if the main diagonal is uniform but the anti-diagonal is uniform but with a different letter?\n\n      Example: \n          n=3\n          grid = [['x','a','x'],\n                  ['a','x','a'],\n                  ['x','a','x']]\n\n      Then main diagonal: [x, x, x] -> uniform (d='x')\n      Anti-diagonal: [x, x, x] -> uniform (also 'x'), so passes condition 1.\n\n      Then condition 2: non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from 'x'. \n          The non-diagonal cells: \n            (0,1): 'a'\n            (1,0): 'a'\n            (1,2): 'a'\n            (2,1): 'a'\n\n          They are all 'a', and 'a' != 'x' -> YES.\n\n  But wait, the example input: \n        ['3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe'] -> Output: 'NO'\n\n      In this example, the grid is:\n          x p x\n          p x p\n          x p e\n\n      Main diagonal: [x, x, e] -> not uniform (x,x,e) -> fails at condition 1.\n\n  However, note: the example input is provided as: \n        ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n      Expected output: ['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\n  Let's test the third example:\n\n      n=3, grid:\n          row0: 'xpx'\n          row1: 'pxp'\n          row2: 'xpe'\n\n      Main diagonal: [grid[0][0], grid[1][1], grid[2][2]] = ['x','x','e'] -> not all same -> fails condition 1 -> so we output \"NO\", which matches.\n\n  However, let's test the second example:\n\n      n=3, grid:\n          row0: 'wsw'\n          row1: 'sws'\n          row2: 'wsw'\n\n      Main diagonal: [w, w, w] -> uniform, d='w'\n      Anti-diagonal: [w, w, w] -> uniform, d='w'\n\n      Then non-diagonal: \n          (0,1): 's'\n          (0,2): skipped (because 0+2 = 2, which is n-1 (since n=3, n-1=2) -> so (0,2) is anti-diagonal? Actually, anti-diagonal includes (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). \n\n      But wait, we skipped (0,2) and (2,0) because they are on the anti-diagonal (since 0+2=2 and 2+0=2, which equals n-1=2). \n\n      The non-diagonal cells are: (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)\n\n      Values: \n          (0,1): 's'\n          (1,0): 's'\n          (1,2): 's'\n          (2,1): 's'\n\n      So they are all 's', and 's' != 'w' -> YES.\n\n  But wait, how did we get the anti-diagonal? In our code, we are skipping the anti-diagonal by condition `if i+j == n-1`. So the anti-diagonal is correctly skipped.\n\n  However, note: the anti-diagonal is defined as the set of points (i, j) such that i+j = n-1. For n=3, that's (0,2), (1,1), (2,0).\n\n  So the code is:\n\n      n = int(input().strip())\n      grid = []\n      for i in range(n):\n          grid.append(input().strip())\n\n      # Step 1: Check the two diagonals\n      d_letter = grid[0][0]\n      # Check main diagonal\n      for i in range(n):\n          if grid[i][i] != d_letter:\n              print(\"NO\")\n              exit(0)\n\n      # Check anti-diagonal\n      for i in range(n):\n          if grid[i][n-1-i] != d_letter:\n              print(\"NO\")\n              exit(0)\n\n      # Step 2: Check the non-diagonal cells\n      other_letter = None\n      for i in range(n):\n          for j in range(n):\n              # Skip if on main diagonal or anti-diagonal\n              if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                  continue\n              if other_letter is None:\n                  other_letter = grid[i][j]\n              else:\n                  if grid[i][j] != other_letter:\n                      print(\"NO\")\n                      exit(0)\n\n      # Now, we must ensure that the non-diagonal cells are not the same as the diagonal letter.\n      if other_letter == d_letter:\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      # If we passed everything, then YES.\n      print(\"YES\")\n\n  But wait: what if the grid has only one non-diagonal cell? Then we set other_letter, and then the condition other_letter != d_letter holds.\n\n  However, consider: \n      n=3, grid:\n          aaa\n          aba\n          aaa\n\n      Main diagonal: [a, a, a] -> ok, d_letter='a'\n      Anti-diagonal: [a, a, a] -> ok.\n\n      Non-diagonal: \n          (0,1): 'a' -> so we set other_letter='a'\n          Then we check: other_letter == d_letter -> 'a'=='a' -> then we output \"NO\".\n\n      But the grid is:\n\n          aaa\n          aba\n          aaa\n\n      According to the problem: \n          - The diagonals are all 'a'\n          - The non-diagonals must be the same and different from 'a'. But here the non-diagonals are 'a' (in (0,1)) and also (1,0) and (1,2) and (2,1) are 'b' and 'a'? \n\n      Wait, let me write the grid:\n\n          row0: 'aaa' -> [a, a, a]\n          row1: 'aba' -> [a, b, a]\n          row2: 'aaa' -> [a, a, a]\n\n      Non-diagonal cells: \n          (0,1): a -> included in anti-diagonal? No: (0,1): 0+1=1, n-1=2 -> not 2, so not anti-diagonal. But wait, (0,1) is not the main diagonal (0!=1) and not anti-diagonal (0+1 != 2). So it is non-diagonal.\n\n      Then we have:\n          (0,1): a\n          (1,0): a -> but (1,0): 1+0=1 !=2 -> non-diagonal? Actually, (1,0): i=1, j=0 -> not main (1!=0) and not anti (1+0=1 !=2) -> non-diagonal.\n          (1,2): a -> non-diagonal? (1,2): 1+2=3, n=3 -> n-1=2 -> 3 !=2 -> non-diagonal.\n          (2,1): a -> non-diagonal? (2,1): 2+1=3 !=2 -> non-diagonal.\n\n      But wait, (0,1) and (1,0) and (1,2) and (2,1) are all 'a' and also the anti-diagonal? Actually, no: the anti-diagonal is (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). \n\n      So the grid has:\n          row0: [a, a, a] -> (0,0) main, (0,1) non-diag, (0,2) anti-diag (which is a)\n          row1: [a, b, a] -> (1,0) non-diag (a), (1,1) main/anti (b is not the same as d_letter? Actually, the main diagonal requires (1,1) to be d_letter (which is 'a') but it's 'b'. \n\n      So in the first step, we check the main diagonal: \n          grid[0][0]='a', grid[1][1]='b' -> fails.\n\n      Therefore, the example I constructed was incorrect.\n\n  Let me fix: the grid must have the entire main diagonal and anti-diagonal as the same letter. So if we set d_letter='a', then (1,1) must be 'a'. \n\n  Therefore, the example above fails at the first condition.\n\n  But consider: \n\n      n=3, grid:\n          aaa\n          aza\n          aaa\n\n      Then main diagonal: [a, z, a] -> fails.\n\n  So the example that fails the second condition (non-diagonal) must have the diagonals uniform.\n\n  However, note: the above code for Step 1 sets d_letter = grid[0][0]. Then checks the entire main diagonal and anti-diagonal against grid[0][0]. \n\n  What if the main diagonal is uniform but not starting with grid[0][0]? \n\n      Example: \n          n=3, grid:\n          zzz\n          zzz\n          zzz\n\n      Then d_letter = 'z'\n      Main diagonal: [z,z,z] -> ok.\n      Anti-diagonal: [z,z,z] -> ok.\n\n      Then non-diagonal: \n          We have to check: \n            (0,1): 'z' -> but wait, the entire grid is 'z'. Then the non-diagonal cells are 'z'. Then we set other_letter='z' and then check other_letter != d_letter -> fails.\n\n      But wait, the problem says: the non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from the diagonal letter.\n\n      In this case, the entire grid is the same letter. Then the diagonals are 'z', and the non-diagonals are 'z' (same as the diagonal) -> so according to the problem, it should be NO.\n\n      However, let me read the problem again: \n          \"all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\n      So if the non-diagonal squares have the same letter as the diagonal, then it fails.\n\n      Therefore, the above example (all 'z') should output \"NO\".\n\n  Now, what if we have:\n\n      n=3, grid:\n          aaa\n          aba\n          aaa\n\n      But wait, the main diagonal is [a, b, a] -> not uniform -> fails.\n\n  One more example: \n\n      n=3, grid:\n          aba\n          bbb\n          abc\n\n      Main diagonal: [a, b, c] -> not uniform -> fails.\n\n  Therefore, the code seems to work.\n\n  However, consider an example where the main diagonal is uniform but the anti-diagonal is uniform but with a different letter? \n\n      Example: \n          n=3, grid:\n          a b a\n          b c b\n          a b a\n\n      Main diagonal: [a, c, a] -> not uniform -> fails.\n\n  We cannot have two different uniform diagonals (unless they are the same letter). Because the center is common.\n\n  Therefore, the two diagonals must be the same letter (the center is common). So the example above fails.\n\n  But what if we have:\n\n          a b a\n          b a b\n          a b a\n\n      Then main diagonal: [a, a, a] -> uniform (d_letter='a')\n      Anti-diagonal: [a, a, a] -> uniform (d_letter='a') [because we set d_letter from the first element which is 'a']\n\n      Now, non-diagonal: \n          (0,1): 'b'\n          (1,0): 'b'\n          (1,2): 'b'\n          (2,1): 'b'\n\n      Then other_letter='b', and 'b' != 'a' -> YES.\n\n  This is the classic X pattern.\n\n  However, note the example input: \n        ['3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw'] -> which is:\n\n          w s w\n          s w s\n          w s w\n\n      Here, the diagonals are all 'w', and the non-diagonals are all 's'. \n\n  But wait, the center is (1,1): 'w' (from the second row, second column) and the anti-diagonal includes (1,1) as well. \n\n  So the code will set d_letter = grid[0][0] = 'w'. Then:\n\n      Main diagonal: [w, w, w] -> ok.\n      Anti-diagonal: [w (from (0,2)), w (from (1,1)), w (from (2,0))] -> ok.\n\n  Then non-diagonal: \n        (0,1): 's' -> set other_letter='s'\n        (1,0): 's'\n        (1,2): 's'\n        (2,1): 's'\n\n  Then check: 's' != 'w' -> yes.\n\n  So outputs \"YES\".\n\n  Now, the example input that fails: \n        ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox']\n\n      This is:\n\n          x o o o x\n          o x o x o\n          s o x o o   -> wait, the third row: 'soxoo' -> so the third row is ['s','o','x','o','o']\n          o x o x o\n          x o o o x\n\n      Check main diagonal: \n          [x, x, x, x, x] -> but wait, the third row third character is 'x'? Actually, the third row is \"soxoo\": \n          row0: index0: 'x'\n          row1: index1: 'x'\n          row2: index2: 'x'\n          row3: index3: 'x'\n          row4: index4: 'x'\n\n          So main diagonal is all 'x'\n\n      Anti-diagonal: \n          row0: last char -> 'x'\n          row1: second last -> 'o'? Actually, row1: 'oxoxo' -> index 3 (since n-1-1 = 3) -> 'x'? Let me index: \n          row0: indices 0 to 4, so last index is 4 -> n-1=4, so for i=0: j=4 -> 'x'\n          i=1: j=3 -> 'x' (because the second row is 'oxoxo', so index3 is 'x')\n          i=2: j=2 -> 'x' (third row: 'soxoo', index2 is 'x')\n          i=3: j=1 -> 'x' (fourth row: 'oxoxo', index1 is 'x')\n          i=4: j=0 -> 'x'\n\n          So anti-diagonal is also all 'x'\n\n      Then non-diagonal: \n          We need to check every cell that is not on the main diagonal (i==j) and not on the anti-diagonal (i+j==4).\n\n          The grid:\n\n          row0: [x,o,o,o,x] -> \n            (0,0): skip (diagonal)\n            (0,1): 'o' -> set other_letter='o'\n            (0,2): 'o' -> same\n            (0,3): 'o' -> same\n            (0,4): skip (anti-diagonal)\n\n          row1: [o,x,o,x,o] ->\n            (1,0): 'o' -> same\n            (1,1): skip (diagonal)\n            (1,2): 'o' -> same\n            (1,3): skip (anti-diagonal: 1+3=4)\n            (1,4): 'o' -> same\n\n          row2: [s,o,x,o,o] ->\n            (2,0): 's' -> different from 'o' -> fails.\n\n          So we output \"NO\", which matches the expected output.\n\n  But wait, the example input is given as:\n\n        ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox']\n\n  And the third row is 'soxoo', so the first element is 's'. \n\n  In the non-diagonal check for (2,0): \n        i=2, j=0: 2==0? no. 2+0=2, which is not equal to 4 (n-1) -> so it is non-diagonal.\n\n  Then we compare: other_letter is set to 'o' from (0,1). Then (2,0) is 's' which is not 'o' -> so we output \"NO\".\n\n  Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n  However, note: the above code exits as soon as it finds a discrepancy in the diagonals or in the non-diagonals. \n\n  But there's a catch: what if the main diagonal is not uniform? Then we output \"NO\" and exit. But what if the anti-diagonal fails too? We check the main diagonal first, so if the main diagonal fails we don't check the anti-diagonal. \n\n  That is acceptable because the condition requires both diagonals to be uniform and same letter. So if the main diagonal is not uniform, we don't care about the anti-diagonal.\n\n  Similarly, if the main diagonal is uniform, then we check the anti-diagonal. If the anti-diagonal fails, we output \"NO\".\n\n  Code:\n\n      n = int(input().strip())\n      grid = []\n      for i in range(n):\n          grid.append(input().strip())\n\n      d_letter = grid[0][0]\n\n      # Check main diagonal\n      for i in range(n):\n          if grid[i][i] != d_letter:\n              print(\"NO\")\n              exit(0)\n\n      # Check anti-diagonal\n      for i in range(n):\n          if grid[i][n-1-i] != d_letter:\n              print(\"NO\")\n              exit(0)\n\n      # Now, check non-diagonal cells\n      other_letter = None\n      for i in range(n):\n          for j in range(n):\n              if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                  continue\n              if other_letter is None:\n                  other_letter = grid[i][j]\n              else:\n                  if grid[i][j] != other_letter:\n                      print(\"NO\")\n                      exit(0)\n\n      # Check that the non-diagonal letter is different from d_letter\n      if other_letter == d_letter:\n          print(\"NO\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      print(\"YES\")\n\n  However, note: the above code will fail if n==1, but the problem says n>=3.\n\n  Let me test with the provided examples:\n\n      Example 1: n=5, grid as above -> outputs \"NO\"\n      Example 2: n=3, grid as ['wsw','sws','wsw'] -> outputs \"YES\"\n      Example 3: n=3, grid as ['xpx','pxp','xpe'] -> \n          Main diagonal: [x, x, e] -> fails at the first condition (grid[2][2] is 'e' != 'x') -> outputs \"NO\"\n\n  All match.\n\n  But wait, the example 3 is given as:\n\n        ['3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n  The grid:\n\n        x p x\n        p x p\n        x p e\n\n  The main diagonal: \n        row0: index0 -> 'x'\n        row1: index1 -> 'x' (from the string \"pxp\", the second character is 'x') -> wait, no: the second row is \"pxp\", so index1 is 'x'? \n        Actually, the second row is \"pxp\", so:\n            index0: 'p'\n            index1: 'x'\n            index2: 'p'\n\n        So main diagonal: \n            row0[0] = 'x'\n            row1[1] = 'x'\n            row2[2] = 'e'\n\n        So the main diagonal is ['x','x','e'] -> not uniform.\n\n  Therefore, the code outputs \"NO\".\n\n  One more corner: what if the grid has a non-diagonal cell that is the same as d_letter? \n\n      Example: \n          n=3, grid:\n          aaa\n          aab\n          aaa\n\n      Main diagonal: [a,a,a] -> uniform, d_letter='a'\n      Anti-diagonal: [a,a,a] -> uniform.\n\n      Then non-diagonal: \n          (0,1): 'a' -> set other_letter='a'\n          Then we check (0,2): skipped (anti-diagonal), (1,0): 'a' -> same, (1,2): 'b' -> different -> fails.\n\n      But wait, (1,2) is non-diagonal: \n          (1,2): i=1, j=2 -> 1!=2 and 1+2=3 !=2 (n=3, so n-1=2) -> non-diagonal.\n\n      Then we set other_letter='a' from (0,1). Then at (1,2) we see 'b' != 'a' -> output \"NO\".\n\n  But what if the non-diagonal cells are all the same except one? Then we catch that.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the non-diagonals must be the same and different from the diagonal.\n\n  Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n  But wait, the above code sets d_letter from grid[0][0]. What if the main diagonal is uniform but with a letter different from grid[0][0]? \n\n      Example: \n          n=3, grid:\n          b b b\n          b a b\n          b b b\n\n      Then d_letter = grid[0][0] = 'b'\n      Main diagonal: [b, a, b] -> not uniform (because the middle is 'a') -> fails.\n\n  But what if we have:\n\n          a a a\n          a b a\n          a a a\n\n      Then main diagonal: [a, b, a] -> fails.\n\n  Now, what if the main diagonal is uniform but the first element is not the same as the rest? \n\n      Example: \n          n=3, grid:\n          b a a\n          a b a\n          a a b\n\n      Then d_letter = grid[0][0] = 'b'\n      Check main diagonal: \n          grid[0][0]=='b' -> ok.\n          grid[1][1]=='b' -> ok.\n          grid[2][2]=='b' -> ok.\n\n      Then anti-diagonal: \n          grid[0][2]=='a' -> but d_letter is 'b', so fails.\n\n      So we output \"NO\".\n\n  But note: the entire main diagonal is 'b', but the entire anti-diagonal is 'a','b','a' -> not uniform. \n\n  However, the problem requires both diagonals to be the same letter. And the center is common, so the two diagonals must be the same letter. \n\n  Therefore, the above example fails.\n\n  But what if the entire grid is:\n\n          b b b\n          b b b\n          b b b\n\n      Then d_letter='b'\n      Main diagonal: [b,b,b] -> ok.\n      Anti-diagonal: [b,b,b] -> ok.\n\n      Then non-diagonal: \n          (0,1): 'b' -> but wait, the entire grid is 'b'. Then we set other_letter='b' and then check other_letter != d_letter -> fails.\n\n      Output \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n  Therefore, the code is as follows.\n\n  However, note: the problem says n>=3 and odd, so we don't have to worry about even n.\n\n  Let's run the provided examples:\n\n      Example 1: \n          Input: \"5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox\"\n\n          We break down the grid:\n\n          n=5\n          grid = [\n            \"xooox\",\n            \"oxoxo\",\n            \"soxoo\",   # Note: the third row is \"soxoo\", so the third row third character (index2) is 'x'\n            \"oxoxo\",\n            \"xooox\"\n          ]\n\n          Main diagonal: \n            [0][0] = 'x'\n            [1][1] = 'x' (second row: \"oxoxo\", index1 is 'x')\n            [2][2] = 'x' (third row: \"soxoo\", index2 is 'x')\n            [3][3] = 'x'\n            [4][4] = 'x'\n\n          Anti-diagonal:\n            [0][4] = 'x'\n            [1][3] = 'x' (second row: index3 is 'x')\n            [2][2] = 'x' (already checked, but here it's the center)\n            [3][1] = 'x' (fourth row: index1 is 'x')\n            [4][0] = 'x'\n\n          Then non-diagonal: \n            We'll find that the third row first character is 's'. \n            Specifically, (2,0): i=2, j=0 -> 2!=0 and 2+0=2 != 4 (n-1=4) -> non-diagonal. \n            The value at (2,0) is 's'. \n\n          Then we set other_letter='s'. Then we check the rest of the non-diagonal cells. We will eventually find:\n\n            (0,1): 'o' -> which is not 's' -> fails.\n\n          But wait, the code sets other_letter from the first non-diagonal cell it encounters. The first non-diagonal cell is (0,1) which is 'o'. Then when we get to (2,0) which is 's', we compare and they are different -> fails.\n\n          However, the example input",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonals**: \n   - **Main Diagonal**: Traverse the grid from the top-left to the bottom-right. All characters along this diagonal must be identical.\n   - **Anti-Diagonal**: Traverse the grid from the top-right to the bottom-left. All characters along this diagonal must also be identical, and the same as those on the main diagonal.\n\n2. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**:\n   - All cells not on either diagonal must form a single letter, which is different from the diagonal letter.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input().strip())\ngrid = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    grid.append(input().strip())\n\nd_letter = grid[0][0]\n\n# Check main diagonal\nfor i in range(n):\n    if grid[i][i] != d_letter:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit(0)\n\n# Check anti-diagonal\nfor i in range(n):\n    if grid[i][n-1-i] != d_letter:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit(0)\n\nother_letter = None\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            continue\n        if other_letter is None:\n            other_letter = grid[i][j]\n        else:\n            if grid[i][j] != other_letter:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\nif other_letter == d_letter:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit(0)\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line reads the size of the grid `n`, followed by `n` lines of grid data.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: The code checks if all elements on the main diagonal (where row index equals column index) and the anti-diagonal (where row index plus column index equals `n-1`) are the same character. If any element differs, it immediately outputs \"NO\".\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: For cells not on either diagonal, the code ensures all such cells contain the same character, which must differ from the diagonal character. If any non-diagonal cell violates this condition, it outputs \"NO\".\n4. **Final Decision**: If all checks pass, the grid forms an \"X\", and the code outputs \"YES\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the conditions for forming an \"X\" by systematically checking each required part of the grid, ensuring correctness with minimal computational overhead.",
