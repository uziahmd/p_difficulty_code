    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a more straightforward method.\n We are to find the longest substring that appears at least twice (and they can overlap).\n\n Approach:\n Since the string length is small (<=100), we can consider checking all possible substrings and record their occurrences.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input string.\n 2. We'll consider all possible substrings (by starting index and length) and store the substring and its starting indices.\n 3. However, we only need to know if a substring appears at least twice, and we want the maximum length.\n\n Alternative approach:\n   - We can iterate over possible lengths from the maximum possible (n-1) down to 1, and for each length, check every substring of that length and see if it appears at least twice.\n\n But note: the problem says \"at least twice\", and they can overlap.\n\n Example: \n   Input \"ababa\": \n        substring \"aba\" appears starting at index0 and index2 -> so length 3 is valid.\n\n However, note that the example output for \"ababa\" is 3.\n\n Another example: \"zzz\": \n        substring \"z\" appears three times, but we are looking for the longest substring that appears at least twice. \n        The substring \"zz\" appears twice (overlapping: [0:2] and [1:3])? Actually, in \"zzz\", the substring \"zz\" appears at [0:2] and [1:3] (if we take two consecutive 'z's). \n        But wait: the substring \"zz\" is two letters, and there are two occurrences: one starting at 0 and one starting at 1.\n\n However, the example output for \"zzz\" is 2.\n\n But note: the substring \"z\" (length=1) also appears three times, but we are to find the longest. So 2 is longer than 1.\n\n However, what about \"zzz\"? \n   Substring of length 2: \"zz\" (from index0 to index1) and \"zz\" (from index1 to index2) -> two occurrences.\n\n But wait, the example input ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] gives output ['0','3','2'].\n\n Why is the first one 0? Because in \"abcd\", no substring (of any length>=1) appears twice.\n\n Implementation:\n\n Let n = len(s)\n We can do:\n   for length in range(n, 0, -1):   # from largest to smallest\n        for start in range(0, n - length + 1):\n            substr = s[start:start+length]\n            # Check if this substring appears at least twice (anywhere, including overlapping)\n            # We can record the first occurrence and then check if we see it again (even if overlapping is allowed, we just need two distinct starting indices)\n\n   But note: two occurrences must be distinct by starting index. However, the same substring can appear multiple times.\n\n   However, the problem says \"can be met in the string at least twice\". And occurrences can overlap.\n\n   We can do: For a given substring, check if there exists an index j (j != start) such that s[j:j+length] == substr.\n\n   But note: if we have two occurrences, they must be two different starting indices. \n\n   However, we don't want to compare with itself. We can check for a second occurrence that starts at a different position.\n\n   But wait: if we have \"aaa\", then for substring \"a\" (length=1): \n        starts at 0,1,2. There are three occurrences. So we can check: if we have at least two distinct starting indices.\n\n   However, we are iterating by length. We can break when we find a substring that appears at least twice.\n\n   But we are going from largest to smallest, so we return the first length we find that has a duplicate.\n\n   However, we must check all substrings of the current length to see if any appears twice.\n\n   Steps for a fixed length L:\n        Create a dictionary to record the substrings and the starting indices? Or we can do without storing all?\n\n   Alternatively, for a fixed length L, we can use a set to record seen substrings. But we cannot simply use a set because we might have the same substring appearing multiple times, but we don't care about the exact count beyond 2.\n\n   However, we must avoid counting the same substring twice if we see it at two different places.\n\n   But note: we are scanning the entire string. We can do:\n\n        seen = set()\n        found_duplicate = False\n        for start in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[start:start+L]\n            # If we have seen this substring before, then we found a duplicate for this length.\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)   # or break out and return L\n            else:\n                seen.add(substr)\n\n        Then move to the next length (smaller) if not found.\n\n   However, wait: what if the same substring appears non-overlapping? This set method will catch the first duplicate. But what if we have a substring that appears three times? Then the first two occurrences will be caught.\n\n   But the problem: we are going from large L to small. So we want the largest L for which there is at least one substring that appears at least twice.\n\n   However, note: if a substring of length L appears twice, then we can break and output L.\n\n   But wait: what if a substring of length L appears twice, but a substring of length L+1 (which includes the above substring) doesn't necessarily have a duplicate? Actually, we are checking by fixed length.\n\n   However, we are iterating from the largest possible length (n) down to 1. So we are checking for the longest substring.\n\n   But note: the substring of length L is independent from the substring of length L+1.\n\n   However, if we find a duplicate substring of length L, then we output L and stop. But what if there is a duplicate substring of length L+1? Then we would have found it earlier (because we are going from larger to smaller). \n\n   Actually, we are iterating from the maximum length (n) down to 1. So we are checking the largest lengths first. \n\n   But wait: the maximum length of a substring that can appear twice must be less than n (unless the entire string is repeated, which is impossible for two distinct occurrences unless the string is periodic? Actually, no: two distinct occurrences of the entire string would require the string to be of length 0 or the two occurrences must be the same, but they can overlap. However, the entire substring cannot appear twice unless the string is of length 0? Actually, the entire substring of length n can only appear once (from index0 to index n-1). So the maximum length we can have for a duplicate substring is n-1.\n\n   However, let's think: \n        Example: \"aaa\" -> n=3. The entire substring \"aaa\" (length=3) appears only once. But the substring \"aa\" (length=2) appears twice: at index0 and index1.\n\n   Therefore, we should start from n-1 down to 1.\n\n   But note: what if the string is \"aaaa\"? \n        Entire string \"aaaa\" (length=4) appears once.\n        Then check length 3: \n            substrings: \"aaa\" (starting at0) and \"aaa\" (starting at1) -> duplicate. So answer is 3.\n\n   So we can iterate from L = n-1 down to 1.\n\n   However, what if the string is \"abcde\"? Then no duplicate for any length from 1 to 4, so we output 0.\n\n   But note: the example input \"abcd\" outputs 0.\n\n   Algorithm:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n\n        # If n==0, then output 0. But the problem says non-empty string.\n\n        # We consider lengths from n-1 down to 1.\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            found = False\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    exit(0)\n                seen.add(substr)\n\n        # If no duplicate found for any length, output 0.\n        print(0)\n\n   But wait: what if the same substring appears three times? Then we break on the first duplicate we find for that length. That's okay.\n\n   However, consider: \n        s = \"ababa\", n=5, we start with L=4: \n            substrings: \"abab\", \"baba\"\n            set: {\"abab\", \"baba\"} -> no duplicate.\n        Then L=3: \n            substrings: \"aba\", \"bab\", \"aba\"\n            When we see the second \"aba\", we break and output 3.\n\n   But note: the substring \"aba\" appears at index0 and index2.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, what if the duplicate substring is found at a later occurrence, but the same substring was already seen at an earlier index? Our set method will catch it.\n\n   But wait: what if the substring appears non-contiguously? For example, \"axa\" in \"axaxa\" for substring \"a\" (which appears three times) but we are checking for longer ones first.\n\n   However, the above code does not account for the fact that the same substring might appear in non-overlapping parts and we are storing all occurrences we've seen so far.\n\n   But the set only stores the substring, and we are traversing the string. For example, for L=1 in \"axaxa\":\n        i=0: substr='a' -> add to set.\n        i=1: substr='x' -> add to set.\n        i=2: substr='a' -> found in set -> output 1.\n\n   However, we are checking from L=n-1 down to 1. So if we don't find any duplicate for L=4, then L=3, then L=2, then L=1, we break at L=1.\n\n   But the problem: we want the longest substring. So if a substring of length 1 is found, but we haven't checked a substring of length 2 or 3? Actually, we are going from high to low, so we check the highest first.\n\n   Correction: we are going from L=n-1 down to 1, so we check the largest possible duplicates first. But if we find a duplicate for L=3, we output 3 and exit. Otherwise, we check L=2, then L=1.\n\n   However, the example \"ababa\" has a duplicate for L=3, so we output 3.\n\n   But wait: what if there are two different substrings of the same length that both have duplicates? We break at the first one we find (which is the largest length). That's correct.\n\n   However, what if a substring of length 3 is found, but there is a substring of length 4 that also has a duplicate? Then we would have found the length 4 first. But note: the maximum length we can get is n-1. So we start from n-1 and go down. \n\n   But wait: in \"aaa\", n=3, we check L=2: \n        substring \"aa\" at index0: \"aa\", then at index1: \"aa\" -> duplicate, so output 2.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, consider: \"aabaac\" (example from the sample: not provided, but let's test)\n        We are to find the longest substring that appears at least twice.\n\n        What are the candidates?\n        \"aa\" appears at index0 and index1? Actually, at index0: \"aa\", then at index4: \"aa\" (if we look at \"c\" then no, wait: \"aabaac\": \n            indices: \n                0: 'a'\n                1: 'a'\n                2: 'b'\n                3: 'a'\n                4: 'a'\n                5: 'c'\n\n        So substring \"aa\" appears at [0:2] and [3:5]? Actually, at [0:2]: \"aa\", and [3:5]: \"aa\" (but wait, the substring of length 2 starting at index3 is \"aa\")? \n        Also, \"aa\" at index4? No, because index4 is the last two characters: \"ac\". \n\n        So actually, \"aa\" appears at index0 and index3. \n\n        Now, is there a longer substring? \n        Length 3: \n            \"aab\": appears at index0\n            \"aba\": at index1\n            \"baa\": at index2\n            \"aac\": at index3\n            None of these repeat.\n\n        So the answer should be 2.\n\n        With our algorithm for \"aabaac\":\n            n=6, check L=5: \n                substrings: \"aabaac\", \"abaac\" -> no duplicate.\n            L=4: \n                \"aabaa\", \"abaac\" -> no duplicate.\n            L=3: \n                \"aaba\", \"abaa\", \"baac\" -> no duplicate.\n            L=2: \n                \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"aa\", \"ac\" -> when we get to the second \"aa\" (at index3) we break and output 2.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n   However, note: the set method may not be efficient for very long strings, but the problem states the string length is at most 100.\n\n   But wait: what if the same substring appears many times? The set will grow with the number of distinct substrings of that length. The total distinct substrings of length L is at most n-L+1, and n<=100, so maximum 100 distinct substrings per length.\n\n   Therefore, the overall complexity is O(n^2) in the worst-case (for each length from 1 to n-1, we iterate over n-L+1 substrings). The total number of substrings considered is about sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n-L+1) ~ O(n^2). Since n<=100, that's about 5000 operations, which is acceptable.\n\n   But note: we are breaking early if we find a duplicate for a given length. So worst-case we might check all substrings for each length until we find a duplicate, but worst-case (no duplicates) we check all.\n\n   However, worst-case (no duplicates) we check all substrings of all lengths. The total number is still about O(n^2). \n\n   But wait: the total number of substrings is n*(n+1)/2, which for n=100 is 5050, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, we are iterating from the largest length (n-1) down to 1, so we do:\n\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n   The inner loop runs (n - L + 1) times for each L.\n\n   The total number of iterations is: \n        Sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n - L + 1) = (n) + (n-1) + ... + 1 = n*(n+1)/2, which is 5050 for n=100.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n\n        # Edge case: if the string is empty, but problem says non-empty.\n\n        # We'll iterate from L = n-1 down to 1.\n        for length in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = {}\n            # We can use a set or a dict (but set is simpler). However, we don't need counts, just presence.\n            seen_set = set()\n            found = False\n            for start in range(0, n - length + 1):\n                substr = s[start:start+length]\n                if substr in seen_set:\n                    print(length)\n                    exit(0)\n                seen_set.add(substr)\n\n        print(0)\n\n   However, wait: we are using a set and adding every substring we see. But what if the same substring appears again? We break when we see it again.\n\n   But note: if we see a substring for the first time, we add it. The next time we see the same substring (even if it's the same as a previous one) we break.\n\n   But wait: what if we see the same substring twice in the same pass? Then we break.\n\n   However, we are storing the substring in the set and checking before adding. So we break the first time we see a duplicate.\n\n   But note: the set will contain the substring from the first occurrence. Then the next occurrence (which is a duplicate) will trigger the condition.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, there is an edge: what if the same substring appears at two different positions, but the set does not record the same substring twice? Exactly, so the set will have the substring once, and the second time we check and find it in the set.\n\n   But wait: what if we have a substring that appears three times? Then the second occurrence will break, so we don't need to check the third.\n\n   This is efficient.\n\n   But wait: what if the substring we are checking is long and we are storing many substrings? The memory usage is the number of distinct substrings of that length, which is at most (n-length+1). For length=1, up to 26 (if only one letter) but worst-case, the distinct substrings can be up to 26^(length) but wait, the string is only 100 characters and we are taking contiguous substrings. The distinct substrings of a fixed length L is at most (n-L+1) (the number of occurrences) but distinctness is limited by the alphabet (which is 26). However, the set will have at most 26^L distinct substrings, but note: we are storing by contiguous substring and the string is fixed. But since the string is only 100, and L is at most 99, we cannot have 26^99 distinct substrings. Actually, we are storing the actual substring, and the total distinct substrings of length L in the entire string is at most (n-L+1). \n\n   But wait: the set for a fixed L will have at most (n-L+1) elements, because we are storing each substring we see. However, if the same substring appears multiple times, we store it only once.\n\n   So the set size is at most the number of distinct substrings of length L, which is <= (n-L+1). \n\n   Since n<=100, the maximum distinct substrings for a given L is 100, so the set will never exceed 100 elements.\n\n   Therefore, the code is efficient.\n\n   However, one more edge: if the string is \"a\"*100 (all 'a's). Then for length=99:\n        We have two substrings: \"a\"*99 and \"a\"*99 (from index0 and index1). So we break and output 99.\n\n   But wait: the entire string is 100 a's. Then the substring of length 99 appears twice: at index0 and index1.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Let's test with \"aaa\": \n        n=3, we check L=2: \n            substring0: \"aa\", substring1: \"aa\" -> duplicate, so output 2.\n\n   Another test: \"aabb\"\n        n=4, check L=3: \n            \"aab\", \"abb\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=2:\n            \"aa\", \"ab\", \"bb\" -> no duplicate (we see \"aa\" once, then \"ab\", then \"bb\")\n        L=1:\n            \"a\",\"a\",\"b\",\"b\" -> when we see the second 'a' (at index2) we break and output 1.\n\n   But wait, \"a\" appears twice (at index0 and index2) and \"b\" appears twice (at index2 and index3). So the longest substring that appears at least twice is of length 1.\n\n   However, the problem says: the longest substring that appears at least twice. So 1 is the answer.\n\n   But note: the example input \"abcd\" (which has no duplicate) outputs 0.\n\n   But wait: in our code, we break at the first duplicate we find (from the largest length). In \"aabb\", we don't find any duplicate for L=3,2, so we go to L=1 and then we break at the second 'a' (or the second 'b'? Actually, we break at the first duplicate we find in L=1. Since we traverse from left to right, we will break at the first duplicate. \n\n   However, the order of checking in L=1:\n        index0: 'a' -> add to set.\n        index1: 'a' -> found, so we break and output 1.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"at least twice\", so even if we find a duplicate at the second occurrence, that's two. The third occurrence is not needed.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        # We consider lengths from n-1 down to 1.\n        for length in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(0, n - length + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+length]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(length)\n                    exit(0)\n                seen.add(substr)\n        print(0)\n\n   However, wait: what if the same substring appears more than twice? We break on the second occurrence, which is correct.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"at least twice\", so two or more.\n\n   This code meets the requirement.\n\n   But wait: what if the same substring appears twice, but we are checking for a longer substring that is contained in it? Actually, we are checking by fixed length. The substring of length L is independent.\n\n   However, the problem does not require the substring to be primitive or anything. We are only concerned with contiguous substring.\n\n   One more example: \"abcabc\" -> \n        n=6, check L=5: \n            \"abcab\", \"bcabc\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=4:\n            \"abca\", \"bcab\", \"cabc\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=3:\n            \"abc\", \"bca\", \"cab\", \"abc\" -> we see \"abc\" twice (at index0 and index3). So output 3.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, wait: the substring \"abc\" appears twice, but the entire string is \"abcabc\", so the two occurrences are non-overlapping. But the problem allows overlapping.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"These occurrences can overlap\", meaning they can share some letters. But in this case, they don't, and that's allowed.\n\n   Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n   But wait: what if the string is \"ababab\"? \n        n=6, check L=5: \n            \"ababa\", \"baban\" -> wait, the string is \"ababab\", so:\n                substring0: \"ababa\"\n                substring1: \"babab\"\n            They are different.\n\n        L=4:\n            \"abab\", \"baba\", \"abab\" -> duplicate \"abab\" at index0 and index2. Output 4.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, wait: the substring \"abab\" appears at index0 and index2 (so they are separated by one character). \n\n   But note: the problem says \"at least twice\", and they can overlap. The two occurrences of \"abab\" in \"ababab\" are not overlapping? \n        Occurrence1: from index0 to index3: \"abab\"\n        Occurrence2: from index2 to index5: \"abab\" (if we take 4 characters from index2: s[2:6] -> \"abab\")\n        These two occurrences overlap (they share the substring from index2 to index3).\n\n   But the problem says \"occurrences can overlap\", so that's allowed.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the above code uses `exit(0)` which terminates the program. We are in a script, so that's acceptable.\n\n   But the problem requires reading from stdin and writing to stdout.\n\n   We can write:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        # If the string is of length 1, then the maximum length we check is 0 (since we go from n-1=0 down to 1 -> no loop). Then we output 0.\n\n        # Example: \"a\" -> output 0.\n\n        # But wait: if the string is \"a\", then there is no substring of length>=1 that appears twice. Correct.\n\n        # However, what if the string is \"aa\" (n=2): \n        #   Check L=1: \n        #       i=0: substr='a' -> add to set.\n        #       i=1: substr='a' -> found, so output 1.\n\n        # But wait: the example \"zzz\" (n=3) outputs 2. Our code: \n        #   Check L=2: \n        #       i=0: substr='zz' -> add to set.\n        #       i=1: substr='zz' -> found, output 2.\n\n        # So that matches.\n\n   Therefore, we can write the code as above.\n\n   However, note: the problem input is given as a list of strings? The example input is given as:\n\n        ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   But the problem says: \n        \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   So we read one string.\n\n   But the example input is shown as a list. Actually, the example input is provided as separate lines? Or one string per test?\n\n   The problem says: \n        \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   And the example input is:\n\n        ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   This seems like multiple test cases? But the problem statement does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n   Actually, looking at the example: \n        Input: \n            ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n        Output:\n            ['0', '3', '2']\n\n   This suggests that the input is a list of strings.\n\n   But the problem says: \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   Clarification: the problem says the first input line contains the string. Then the example input is given as a list. \n\n   However, the problem says: \"You're given a string\", singular.\n\n   But the example input is given as a list of three strings.\n\n   Let me re-read the problem statement: \n        \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n        You're given a string of lower-case Latin letters. Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n        Input\n        The first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n        Output\n        Output one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n        Example\n        Input\n        ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n        Output\n        ['0', '3', '2']\"\n\n   This example input format is ambiguous. The problem says the first input line contains the string. But the example input is given as a list of three strings.\n\n   After re‐reading: the example input is showing three test cases. The problem might be expecting multiple test cases.\n\n   But the problem statement says: \"The first input line contains the string.\" (singular)\n\n   However, the example input is provided as:\n\n        ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   And the expected output is:\n\n        ['0', '3', '2']\n\n   So it seems the input might be multiple test cases, one string per line.\n\n   But wait, the problem says \"The first input line contains the string\", meaning one string per test case? And then how many test cases?\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might be providing one string per test case, and the example input is three separate inputs (each in a separate line) but written as a list for clarity.\n\n   The problem does not specify the number of test cases.\n\n   Looking at the example output: it outputs three numbers: 0, 3, 2.\n\n   This suggests that the input is three separate strings, each in its own line.\n\n   But the problem statement says: \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   This is confusing.\n\n   After checking competitive programming problems: often, the input is one test case. But the example shows three.\n\n   Let me read the example again: \n        Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   This is one string per element of the list.\n\n   How is the input given? The problem says: the first input line contains the string. \n\n   But if there are three test cases, then there would be three lines.\n\n   Clarification: the problem says \"The first input line\", but if there are multiple test cases, then there are multiple lines.\n\n   Actually, the problem statement is ambiguous.\n\n   But note: the constraints say the string is non-empty and length<=100. There is no constraint on the number of test cases.\n\n   How to handle?\n\n   The problem says: \n        \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   This implies one string. But the example input is given as a list of three.\n\n   Alternatively, the example input is provided as one string that is a list of three strings? That would be invalid.\n\n   After reading the problem statement again: \n        \"Input\n        The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   This means that the input is one line containing a string.\n\n   However, the example input is shown as:\n\n        ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   This is likely a formatting issue. The intended input is three separate test cases, each in one line.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"The first input line contains the string\", so if there are three test cases, then there would be three lines.\n\n   But the example output is three numbers.\n\n   So I think the problem intended to say: the input consists of several test cases, each test case is a string on its own line.\n\n   But the problem statement did not specify the number of test cases.\n\n   Since the problem statement says \"The first input line\", and then the example input is a list, it's ambiguous.\n\n   However, in competitive programming, sometimes the input format is specified as: \n        The first line is the number of test cases, then each test case on a separate line.\n\n   But here, the problem does not specify.\n\n   Let me look at the example output: \n        Output: ['0','3','2']\n\n   So three outputs.\n\n   Therefore, the input must be three strings (one per line).\n\n   But the problem statement says \"The first input line contains the string\", which implies one string.\n\n   Since the problem is from a competition, and the example input is given as a list, I suspect the intended format is one string per test case, and the input may have multiple test cases.\n\n   However, the problem statement does not specify the number of test cases.\n\n   We must assume that the input is one string (one test case) because the problem says \"The first input line\".\n\n   But wait, the example input is three strings. \n\n   This is a contradiction.\n\n   After re‐examining: the example input is given as:\n\n        Input\n        ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   This is probably meant to represent three test cases. In many programming competitions, the input format is described as having multiple test cases, but the problem statement here did not.\n\n   However, the example output has three numbers.\n\n   Therefore, the problem likely has multiple test cases. The input format is:\n\n        The first line: a positive integer T, the number of test cases.\n        Then T lines, each containing a string.\n\n   But wait, the problem statement does not say that.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem statement is poorly formatted.\n\n   But the problem says: \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   I think there is a misunderstanding. The example input is provided as a list of strings, but the actual input for the program is one string (for one test case). \n\n   However, the problem says \"You're given a string\", singular.\n\n   And the example input is three strings, so we must be prepared for multiple test cases.\n\n   But the problem statement does not specify.\n\n   Since the problem is from a competition and the example input is three strings, I will assume that the input consists of multiple test cases. The first line is the number of test cases, and then each test case is a string.\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as:\n\n        ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   without a first line indicating the number of test cases.\n\n   Alternatively, the example input is three separate runs.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, I will stick to the problem statement: \"The first input line contains the string.\" meaning one string.\n\n   But the example output has three numbers.\n\n   I must clarify: the problem statement says \"Output one number\", meaning one test case outputs one number.\n\n   Then why the example output is a list of three numbers?\n\n   I think the example input and output are provided for three separate examples. The user must run the program three times for the three examples.\n\n   Or the problem intended to say: \"You're given a string (in the first input line) and you must output the answer for that string.\"\n\n   Then the example input is just showing three examples.\n\n   Therefore, we assume the input is one string.\n\n   But the example output is three numbers, so the problem must be handling multiple test cases.\n\n   Since the problem statement is ambiguous, I will write the code to handle one test case, and then if the competition expects multiple test cases, we can adjust.\n\n   However, the problem statement says: \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   So I will read one string.\n\n   But wait: the example input is given as a list of three strings. This might be a mistake in the problem statement.\n\n   Alternatively, the input is one string that is a concatenation of the three examples? That would be \"abcdababa zz z\" which is invalid.\n\n   I decide to read one string and output one number.\n\n   But the example output is three numbers.\n\n   Therefore, the problem must be providing multiple test cases.\n\n   After further thought: the problem statement says \"The first input line contains the string\", but the example input is provided as three strings. \n\n   This is inconsistent.\n\n   I think the problem intended to provide the input in multiple lines. Each line is a test case.\n\n   But the problem statement did not specify the number of test cases.\n\n   How to resolve?\n\n   Let me assume that the input format is:\n\n        The first line: a single integer T (number of test cases)\n        Then T lines, each containing a string.\n\n   Then the example input would be:\n\n        3\n        abcd\n        ababa\n        zzz\n\n   And the output would be:\n\n        0\n        3\n        2\n\n   But the problem statement does not say that.\n\n   Alternatively, the input is a single string for each test case, and there is only one test case.\n\n   The example input is just three examples, not the input for one run.\n\n   Given the confusion, I will write the code to handle one test case (one string) and output one number.\n\n   If the competition provides multiple test cases, we must read until EOF.\n\n   But the problem statement says the first input line contains the string.\n\n   Since the problem constraints say the string length is at most 100, and the string is non-empty, we can read one string.\n\n   But the example output is three numbers. \n\n   I decide to follow the problem statement literally: one string per run.\n\n   However, the example input is given as a list of three strings. \n\n   This is a problem.\n\n   After reading the problem statement again: \n        \"Input\n        The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   This implies one string.\n\n   But the example input is three strings.\n\n   I think the example input is just illustrative of three test cases, but the actual input for the program is one string.\n\n   So we will read one string.\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as:\n\n        ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   This is likely a representation of three separate inputs.\n\n   Therefore, if we are to run the program three times, we would input:\n\n        abcd\n        ababa\n        zzz\n\n   separately.\n\n   But the problem says \"The first input line\", so in one run, the program reads one string.\n\n   We'll assume that the input is one string.\n\n   Code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        if n == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # Iterate from n-1 down to 1\n            for length in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n                seen = set()\n                for i in range(0, n - length + 1):\n                    substr = s[i:i+length]\n                    if substr in seen:\n                        print(length)\n                        exit(0)\n                    seen.add(substr)\n            print(0)\n\n   However, if the input has multiple test cases, we need to read until EOF.\n\n   But the problem statement says the first input line contains the string, so we assume one test case.\n\n   But the example output is three numbers, so",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap, which adds a layer of complexity to the problem. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous sequence of characters within a string that appears more than once. The key observation here is that overlapping occurrences are allowed, meaning the same substring can appear in overlapping positions within the string.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves checking all possible substrings of the string, starting from the longest possible length down to the shortest. For each length, we examine all substrings of that length and use a set to track seen substrings. If a substring is encountered more than once, we immediately return its length as the result since we are checking from the largest to the smallest length.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm iterates over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (n-1) down to 1. For each length, it checks every substring of that length by sliding a window across the string. A set is used to keep track of substrings encountered so far. If a substring is found in the set during the iteration, it means the substring appears at least twice, and its length is returned immediately.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm's time complexity is O(n^3) in the worst case, where n is the length of the string. This is because for each possible substring length (up to n-1), we might check up to O(n) substrings, each of length O(n). However, given the constraint that the string length does not exceed 100, this approach is efficient enough.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    for length in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(0, n - length + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+length]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(length)\n                return\n            seen.add(substr)\n    print(0)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read from standard input.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the string is empty (though the problem guarantees it's non-empty), the output is 0.\n3. **Iterating Over Substring Lengths**: The loop starts from the largest possible substring length (n-1) down to 1. For each length, it checks all substrings of that length.\n4. **Tracking Seen Substrings**: A set is used to keep track of substrings encountered during the iteration. If a substring is found in the set, it means the substring appears at least twice, and its length is printed, and the program exits.\n5. **Output Result**: If no duplicate substring is found after checking all lengths, the output is 0, indicating no such substring exists in the string.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the longest repeating substring by leveraging early termination upon finding the first valid result, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.",
