The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices.

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\nWe are to determine whether there exists an integer k>1 such that a snowflake with n vertices can be constructed.\n\nThe snowflake construction:\n1. Start with 1 vertex (step 0).\n2. Then, we do at least one step of expansion: in each step, every leaf (vertex with degree 1) is connected to k new vertices.\n\nBut note: the process must be done at least once, meaning we have at least one expansion.\n\nLet's denote by d the number of expansion steps (at least 1).\n\nAt step 0: 1 vertex.\nAt step 1: 1 + k vertices.\nAt step 2: 1 + k + k*(k-1) [because the initial k vertices each get k-1 new ones?] \n\nWait, let me reexamine the rule:\n\nRule: \n  - Initially, one vertex.\n  - Then, the initial vertex is connected to k new vertices. Now we have 1 + k vertices.\n  - Then, \"each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (i.e., leaves) is connected to k more new vertices.\n\nBut note: after the first step, we have k leaves (the new vertices). Then we add k * k new vertices? Actually, no.\n\nHowever, the example for k=4: the smallest snowflake (after at least one step) has 1 + 4 = 5? But the example says the smallest for k=4 is shown. Let me think:\n\nActually, the example says: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\" \n\nWait, the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the entire process (which includes the initial connection and then at least one expansion) is done. But note: the initial connection is the first step, and then we must do the expansion (second step) at least once? Or is the initial step the first expansion and then we do at least one more?\n\nReading again: \n  Step 1: connect the initial to k new -> total vertices: 1 + k.\n  Then, we do the next step: now we have k leaves. Each of these k leaves will be connected to k new vertices -> so we add k * k new vertices. Then the total becomes 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1). Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\nSo the first expansion (initial) is one step, and then the next step (the expansion from leaves) is done at least once. So actually, we are doing at least two steps? Or is the initial connection considered the first step and then the condition \"this step\" (meaning the expansion from leaves) is done at least once?\n\nBut the problem says: \"This step should be done at least once.\" and the step described is: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices.\"\n\nTherefore, the construction is:\n\nStep 0: 1 vertex.\nStep 1: add k vertices (connected to the center) -> total 1+k.\nStep 2: for each of the k leaves, add k new vertices -> total 1 + k + k*k.\n\nBut wait, what if we do more than two steps? \n\nAfter step 2, the graph has:\n  - The center (degree k)\n  - The first ring: k leaves (each now has degree 1 + k (because they are connected to the center and then k new ones) -> so they are no longer leaves?\n    Actually, the rule says: \"each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (leaf) is expanded. After step 2, the leaves are the new ones (k*k of them) and the old leaves become non-leaves (they have degree k+1). \n\nSo then step 3: we would add k * (k*k) = k^3 new vertices.\n\nIn general, after d steps (with d>=1 being the initial step, and then we require at least one more expansion step? Actually, the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion from leaves (the step described) must be performed at least once. Therefore, we have:\n\nMinimum steps: 2 (first step: center to k, second step: expand the k leaves to k*k)\n\nBut note: the problem says \"This step\" (the expansion from leaves) is done at least once. The initial step is separate. So:\n\nTotal vertices for d steps (where d>=1 for the center expansion and then we do at least one expansion from leaves, so d>=2) is:\n\nStep 0: 1\nStep 1: 1 + k\nStep 2: 1 + k + k^2\nStep 3: 1 + k + k^2 + k^3\n\nBut wait, the problem does not specify the number of expansion steps. It says \"at least once\" for the expansion from leaves, meaning we must have at least two steps (step1 and step2). However, note that the problem also says that k>1.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: the snowflake is built in layers. The center is layer0. Then layer1: k vertices. Then layer2: k^2 vertices, layer3: k^3, etc.\n\nBut note: the rule says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" is expanded. In the center, the center is connected to k, so it is not a leaf. The vertices in layer1 are leaves (each connected only to the center) so they are expanded (to layer2). Then layer2 vertices are leaves (each connected only to their parent) so they are expanded (to layer3), and so on.\n\nNow, the total number of vertices after m layers (including the center and up to layer m) is:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\nBut note: the problem requires that the expansion step (from leaves) is done at least once. This means that we must have at least two layers (center and one layer of expansion). So m>=1 (if we count the center as layer0, then we need at least two layers: layer0 and layer1, and then the expansion from layer1 (which is the first expansion) is done at least once). However, wait: the problem says the initial step (connecting the center to k new vertices) is the first part, and then the expansion from leaves (which are the k new vertices) is done at least once. So the minimal configuration is:\n\nn_min = 1 + k + k^2   (for m=2: center, layer1, layer2)\n\nBut note: the problem does not specify the maximum layers. We can have arbitrary layers (as long as k>1). However, the problem does not require to use all layers; we can stop at any layer.\n\nBut the problem asks: does there exist a k>1 and a number of layers m>=1 (at least two layers: center and one expansion from leaves) such that n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m?\n\nWait, actually the problem says: \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning we must have at least one expansion from leaves. So the minimal expansion is two layers (center and one ring of k). However, we can have more.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require the entire snowflake to be built in the minimal way. It just requires that there exists some k>1 and some m>=1 (so at least two layers) such that n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider: the entire snowflake must be built by starting with the center and then expanding for several steps (each step being an expansion from leaves). The expansion from leaves must occur at least once (so at least one expansion step beyond the center).\n\nBut note: the initial step (center to k) is the first expansion? Actually, the problem states two distinct steps:\n\n1. The initial vertex is connected to k new vertices. (This is the first expansion, but the problem doesn't say \"then\" we must do the next step. However, the next step is explicitly required at least once.)\n\nBut the problem says: \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\" Then: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\nSo the two steps are:\n\nStep 1: Connect center to k new. (This creates k leaves.)\nStep 2: Expand each leaf (from step1) by connecting to k new. (This must be done at least once.)\n\nBut note: after step 2, we have leaves again (the new ones) and we could continue. However, the problem does not say we must stop. So the total number of vertices can be:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... + k^m, for some m>=1 (since we require at least the center, the first ring, and the second ring).\n\nBut wait, the problem does not specify that we must stop after the minimal two expansions. We can have arbitrary m>=1 (meaning the expansion from leaves is done at least once, but then we might do more). So the total n is the sum of a geometric series with base k (k>1) and at least two terms (so the series has at least three terms: k^0, k^1, k^2).\n\nHowever, note: the center is 1 (which is k^0), then the first ring is k^1, then the second ring is k^2, etc. So the minimal n is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut note: what if we do only the first two steps? Then n = 1 + k + k^2.\n\nWhat if we do three steps? Then n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require the entire snowflake to be built. It just asks: does there exist a k>1 and a positive integer m (at least 1, because we need at least two layers beyond the center) such that n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) ?\n\nWait, the geometric series: \n  S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nAnd we require m>=1 (so at least two layers: center and two rings? Actually, the center is layer0, then we have at least two expansions: so m>=2? \n\nWait, let me clarify the layers:\n\n- Layer0: center (1 vertex)\n- Layer1: k vertices (added by the first expansion from the center)\n- Then, the first expansion from leaves (layer1) adds k^2 vertices (layer2). Then, if we do another expansion (from leaves in layer2) we add k^3 (layer3), etc.\n\nThe problem says: \"This step\" (expanding leaves) is done at least once. So we must have at least two layers (layer0 and layer1 from the center, and then layer2 from expanding layer1). Therefore, the minimal representation is:\n\nn_min = 1 + k + k^2, for some k>1.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require that the entire snowflake is built in two layers. It can be built in more. So the set of n for which the answer is \"YES\" is the set of numbers that can be represented as:\n\nn = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) for some integers k>1 and m>=2 (because the minimal expansion from leaves is one time, so m=1 would correspond to only one expansion from leaves? Let me define m as the exponent: \n\nIf we let the number of expansions (from leaves) be t (t>=1), then the total layers (including the center) is t+1. The total vertices:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nBut note: the first expansion (from the center) is given, and then we do t expansions (from leaves). The problem requires at least one expansion from leaves, so t>=1. Therefore, the exponent in the numerator is t+1 (which is at least 2) and k>=2.\n\nHowever, note: k must be at least 2 (since k>1 and integer). And t>=1.\n\nSo we are to check: for a given n, does there exist integers k>=2 and t>=1 such that:\n\nn = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nBut note: n can be as large as 10^18, and t can be large? Actually, the exponent t+1 might be large, but note that k is at least 2, so even for small k, the value of n grows very fast.\n\nHow to solve?\n\nWe cannot iterate over k and t because n is huge (up to 10^18) and t and k can be very large.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nNote that the equation:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t\n\ncan be rewritten as:\n\nn*(k-1) = k^(t+1) - 1\n\nBut we don't know k or t.\n\nWe can consider:\n\nCase 1: n is small.\n\nBut n can be up to 10^18.\n\nAnother idea: the minimal representation is for t=1: then n = 1+k+k^2.\n\nWe can fix the exponent t (the number of layers beyond the center, i.e., the number of expansions from leaves) and then try to find k.\n\nBut note: the problem says we can have multiple layers. However, note that the expansion must be consistent: the same k is used throughout.\n\nAlso note: the equation is:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t.\n\nWe can also note that if n is fixed, then k must be at least 2 and at most around n (but actually k is the base, so the exponent t must be small because 2^t grows fast).\n\nObservation: the exponent t (number of expansions from leaves, so total layers is t+1) is at most about 60 because 2^60 is already around 1e18.\n\nSo we can iterate over the possible exponents t (which is from 1 up to about 60) and then for each t, we need to solve for k:\n\nn = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nBut note: the left side is n, and the right side is a polynomial in k. We can rearrange:\n\nn*(k-1) = k^(t+1) - 1\n\nSo, k^(t+1) = n*(k-1) + 1\n\nBut solving for k is difficult. Alternatively, we can think: for a fixed t (say from 1 to 60), we can use binary search for k (k>=2) such that the geometric series (1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t) equals n.\n\nBut note: n can be up to 10^18, and t is at most 60, so k might be as large as about n^(1/t) (which for t=60, n=10^18, k would be about 10^(18/60) ~ 10^0.3 which is about 2, but wait: if t is 60, then k^61 is about 10^18, so k is about 10^(18/61) which is still a small number (around 10^0.3) so k is around 2). \n\nBut note: we have to consider that the geometric series is:\n\nS = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nWe can write a function for fixed t: \n\nGiven t, we want to know if there exists an integer k>=2 such that S = n.\n\nBut note: we can also consider that the equation:\n\nn = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nis equivalent to:\n\nk^(t+1) = n*(k-1)+1\n\nWe can rearrange to:\n\nk^(t+1) - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\nBut that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, we can use binary search for k for a fixed t:\n\nSince k>=2, and the value of k is at least 2 and at most n (but actually, for fixed t, k is bounded by the (t+1)-th root of n*(k-1)+1, which is roughly n^(1/(t+1)) * something). However, note that k must be an integer and the series is increasing with k.\n\nBut note: the series is strictly increasing with k for fixed t, and also we can bound k:\n\nFrom the equation: n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t <= (t+1)*k^t   (since there are t+1 terms and the largest term is k^t)\n\nSo (t+1)*k^t >= n => k >= (n/(t+1))^(1/t)\n\nSimilarly, n <= k^(t+1)/(k-1) < k^(t+1) (since k-1>=1) so k^(t+1) > n => k > n^(1/(t+1))\n\nBut note: the series is (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1) which is less than k^(t+1)/(k-1). \n\nBut we can use:\n\nk_min = ceil(n**(1/(t+1))) and k_max = floor((n*(t+1))**(1/t))? Actually, we can set an upper bound: since the series is 1 + k + ... + k^t, and the last term is k^t, we have k^t <= n, so k <= n**(1/t). \n\nBut wait, if we have t=1, then n = 1+k+k^2, so k^2 <= n, so k <= sqrt(n). For t=2, k^3 <= n, so k <= n**(1/3). \n\nActually, the largest term is k^t, and the whole series is less than (t+1)*k^t, so k^t <= n < (t+1)*k^t => k <= n**(1/t) and k >= (n/(t+1))**(1/t)\n\nBut we can set:\n\nlow_bound = max(2, floor(n**(1/(t+1))))   [since k^(t+1) >= n, so k>=ceil(n**(1/(t+1))) ] ? Not exactly, because the series is (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1) which is about k^t (for large k) but for small k it's different.\n\nAlternatively, we can iterate t from 1 to about 60 (since 2^60 is about 1e18, so for t=60, the base k would be about 2, and the series would be (2^61-1)/1 which is 2^61 which is about 2e18, so n=10^18 is acceptable).\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the series might be built with base k that is larger than 2, but then the exponent t would be smaller.\n\nSo plan:\n\nFor a given test case with n (which can be as big as 10^18), we consider t from 1 to about 60 (inclusive). For each t, we want to check if there exists an integer k>=2 such that:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t\n\nWe can solve for k by binary search in the range [2, n] (but note: k^t <= n, so k <= n**(1/t)). Since t is at most 60, the exponentiation is safe.\n\nBut note: we have to compute k^t for k and t up to 60. However, k can be as large as n**(1/t) which for t=1 is about sqrt(10^18)=1e9, which is too big to iterate over. So we must use binary search for k in the range [2, n**(1/t)] for each t.\n\nBut note: n is up to 10^18, and t from 1 to 60. For t=1, we are looking for k in [2, 1e9] (which is too many to iterate). We need a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the equation:\n\nn = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nand note that k must be an integer. We can rearrange:\n\nk^(t+1) = n*(k-1) + 1\n\nBut we can also note that the geometric series can be computed by Horner's method or by repeated multiplication, but we are going to do a binary search for k.\n\nBut the range for k is [2, n**(1/t)]? Actually, the largest term is k^t, and the entire series is about k^t (if k is large) so k^t <= n. Therefore, k <= n**(1/t). \n\nBut for t=1: k <= sqrt(n) (which is 1e9 for n=10^18) and we cannot iterate from 2 to 1e9. However, we can use binary search for k in [2, int(round(n**(1/t)))] for each t.\n\nBut note: the function f(k) = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1) is strictly increasing with k for k>=2, so we can do binary search.\n\nBut the problem: we have to check for each t from 1 to 60, and for each t, do a binary search in k from 2 to n**(1/t). \n\nHowever, note that when t is large (like 60) then n**(1/t) is very close to 2 (because 2^60 is about 1e18, so for n=10^18, n**(1/60) is about 10^(18/60) ~ 10^0.3 ~ 2). So for large t, the range is small (only a few integers). \n\nBut for small t (like t=1,2,3,..., say t=60) the range for k might be large for small t and small for large t.\n\nBut the total number of t values is at most 60, and for each t we do a binary search (logarithmic in the range). The worst-case is t=1, then the range is [2, 1e9] and we do about 30 iterations (binary search steps). Then for t=2, the range is [2, n**(1/2)] which is [2, 1e9] again. Similarly, t=3: [2, n**(1/3)] ~ [2, 10^6] (because (10^6)^3 = 10^18). \n\nBut note: n can be as small as 1. However, the problem states n>=1, and we are only considering t>=1 (at least two layers). The minimal n is for t=1: 1+k+k^2, which for k>=2 is at least 1+2+4=7.\n\nSo for n<7, we can immediately say \"NO\".\n\nBut note: the example input includes n=1,2,3,6, which are all below 7.\n\nSo we can handle:\n\nIf n < 7: then \"NO\", unless n=1? But wait, the minimal n is 7 (for k=2, t=1). However, what about n=1? The problem says the initial vertex is there, but then we must do at least one expansion (so we must have at least two expansions: the initial and then one from leaves). Therefore, n=1 is not allowed because we must have at least two layers (center, then the first ring, then the second ring). \n\nWait, the problem says: the initial step (connecting the center to k new) is the first expansion, and then the expansion from leaves is done at least once. So the minimal n is 1 + k + k^2 (with k>=2) which is 7.\n\nBut note: the example input:\n\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\nOutput:\n\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nSo n=13 is YES, n=15 is YES, n=255 is YES, n=10101 is YES, and n=1000000000000000000 is NO.\n\nLet's check:\n\nn=13: can we represent 13 as (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1) for some k>=2 and t>=1?\n\nt=1: n = 1+k+k^2 = 13 -> k^2+k+1=13 -> k^2+k-12=0 -> k=( -1 ± sqrt(1+48))/2 = ( -1 ± 7)/2 -> k=3 (positive). So 3 is integer and >=2. So t=1, k=3: 1+3+9=13 -> yes.\n\nn=15: \nt=1: 1+k+k^2=15 -> k^2+k-14=0 -> k=( -1±sqrt(57))/2 -> not integer.\nt=2: 1+k+k^2+k^3=15 -> k^3+k^2+k+1=15 -> for k=2: 1+2+4+8=15 -> yes.\n\nn=255:\nt=1: 1+k+k^2=255 -> k^2+k-254=0 -> k=( -1±sqrt(1+1016))/2 -> sqrt(1017) is not integer (32^2=1024, 31^2=961, 1017-961=56, not square).\nt=2: 1+k+k^2+k^3=255 -> k^3+k^2+k+1=255 -> k=6: 1+6+36+216=259 -> too big; k=5: 1+5+25+125=156; k=6 too big, so no for t=2.\nt=3: 1+k+k^2+k^3+k^4=255 -> k=3: 1+3+9+27+81=121; k=4: 1+4+16+64+256=341 -> too big. So no for t=3.\nt=4: 1+k+k^2+k^3+k^4+k^5=255 -> k=2: 1+2+4+8+16+32=63; k=3: 1+3+9+27+81+243= too big (already 364). No for t=4.\nt=5: k=2: 1+2+4+8+16+32+64=127; k=3: too big. No.\nt=6: k=2: 1+2+4+8+16+32+64+128=255 -> yes! So k=2, t=6: 1+2+4+8+16+32+64+128=255.\n\nBut wait, the equation for t=6: the series goes from k^0 to k^6, so the exponent is 7 (because we have 7 terms: k^0 to k^6). Then n = (k^7-1)/(k-1). For k=2: (128-1)/(2-1)=127, not 255. \n\nWait, I think I messed up the indexing.\n\nIn our equation, we defined:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t   (t+1 terms)\n\nBut in the above calculation for t=6, we have 7 terms (from exponent 0 to 6). Then n = (k^7-1)/(k-1). \n\nFor k=2: (128-1)/1=127, not 255.\n\nBut wait, 2^7 is 128, so (2^7-1)=127.\n\nBut 255 is 2^8-1, which is (k^8-1)/(k-1) for k=2: (256-1)=255. So that would be t=7 (exponent from 0 to 7, so 8 terms). \n\nSo for t=7 (exponent 0 to 7): n = (2^8-1)/(2-1)=255.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\nn = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nSo the exponent in the numerator is (t+1). Therefore, for k=2 and t=7, we get 255.\n\nBut wait, the problem requires that the expansion from leaves is done at least once. How many layers do we have?\n\n- Layer0: center (1 vertex)\n- Layer1: k (2) vertices (from center)\n- Then, we do 7 expansions? Actually, the expansion steps are:\n\nEach expansion step expands every leaf. The first expansion (from the center) gives layer1. Then the expansion from leaves (layer1) gives layer2. Then from layer2 gives layer3, and so on until layer8 (if we do 7 expansions from leaves, then we have 8 layers).\n\nBut note: the problem says \"This step\" (expanding leaves) is done at least once. So we must have at least one expansion from leaves. In our representation, the minimal t is 1 (one expansion from leaves) which gives two layers (center and one ring). But here we have 8 layers (t=7, which counts the number of expansions from leaves). \n\nBut the problem does not restrict the number of expansions, so having 7 expansions is allowed.\n\nSo the algorithm:\n\nFor each test case with n (an integer between 1 and 10^18):\n\n1. If n < 7: then output \"NO\" (because the minimal n is 7 for k=2, t=1: 1+2+4=7).\n\nBut wait, the example n=6 is given and output \"NO\", and n=1,2,3 are \"NO\". However, what about n=4,5,6? They are below 7, so we output \"NO\".\n\n2. For t from 1 to about 60 (or while 2^(t+1) <= n? Actually, we can break when the minimal value for the series (with k=2) exceeds n. The minimal value for a given t is (2^(t+1)-1)/(2-1) = 2^(t+1)-1. So we can iterate t from 1 to floor(log2(n))+1 (but n can be up to 10^18, so log2(10^18) is about 60).\n\nBut note: the series for fixed k=2: n_min(t) = 2^(t+1)-1. We require 2^(t+1)-1 <= n. So t+1 <= log2(n+1). Since n<=10^18, t+1 <= 60 (because 2^60 ~ 1e18, so 2^60 is about 1e18, then 2^61 is 2e18, which is bigger than 10^18). So we can iterate t from 1 to 60.\n\nFor each t (from 1 to 60):\n\n   We wish to know: does there exist an integer k>=2 such that:\n\n        n = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n   We can rewrite this as:\n\n        k^(t+1) = n*(k-1)+1\n\n   But we can also use the geometric series formula.\n\n   We can use binary search for k in the range [2, n**(1/t)] (note: the series has (t+1) terms, the largest term is k^t, and the entire series is at most (t+1)*k^t, but we have an exact formula). However, note that k must be at least 2 and the series increases with k.\n\n   Steps for fixed t:\n\n      low = 2\n      high = min(n, 10**18)   # but we can set a better high: the maximum k is such that k^t <= n (because the last term is k^t and the series is at least k^t). So k <= n**(1/t)\n\n      But note: the series is (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1) and we require k^(t+1)-1 <= n*(k-1) (by the equation). Actually, we can set:\n\n        high = pow(n, 1/t) + 1   [but this is real, we need integer]\n\n      Alternatively, we can set high = 10**6 for t>=2? But wait, for t=1, n can be up to 10^18, then k is up to about 1e9.\n\n   However, we can use:\n\n        low = 2\n        high = 1000000000000000000  # but that's too big. We can set high = n**(1/t) + 100, but we don't want to compute roots for big n and t.\n\n   Instead, we can use:\n\n        k_max = 1\n        # We know that k^t <= n (because the series has at least k^t as the last term) so k <= n**(1/t)\n        # We can set k_max = int(round(n**(1/t))) + 1   but n**(1/t) for n=10^18 and t=1 is 1e9, which is acceptable for binary search? We are only doing logarithmic steps (about 30) for each t, and there are 60 t's, so 60*30 = 1800 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n   But wait, for t=1, the range is [2, 1e9] and we do binary search (about 30 iterations). Then for t=2, the range is [2, 1e9] (same). Then t=3: [2, 1e6] (because (1e6)^3 = 1e18). \n\n   However, note that the equation for t=1 is:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2\n\n   We can solve for k by:\n\n        k^2 + k + (1-n) = 0\n\n   Then k = [-1 + sqrt(1+4*(n-1))]/2\n\n   Then check if that k is integer and >=2.\n\n   Similarly, for t=2:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3\n\n        We can use binary search for k in [2, int(round(n**(1/3)))+1]\n\n   But wait, is that safe? For t=1, we can solve the quadratic equation, but for higher t we can use binary search.\n\n   However, we can also note that the equation:\n\n        n = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n   is equivalent to:\n\n        k^(t+1) - (n)*(k-1) - 1 = 0\n\n   and we can use Newton-Raphson? But we don't need to, since we can binary search.\n\n   Steps for fixed t:\n\n        Let f(k) = (k^(t+1)-1)/(k-1)   [for k>1]\n\n        We wish to find an integer k>=2 such that f(k) = n.\n\n        We know that f(k) is strictly increasing with k.\n\n        We can set:\n\n            low = 2\n            high = 10**18   # but this is too big, we need a better high.\n\n        We can set high = None initially, but we can compute an upper bound.\n\n        Note: k^t <= n (because the last term is k^t and the series is at least k^t). So k <= n**(1/t)\n\n        So we set:\n\n            high = min",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting with a central vertex (layer 0). Each subsequent layer is formed by expanding each leaf vertex (vertices with only one connection) from the previous layer by adding \\( k \\) new vertices, where \\( k > 1 \\). This expansion must be done at least once.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the total number of vertices in the snowflake graph after \\( t \\) expansions (including the initial expansion) is given by the geometric series sum \\( S = 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^t \\). This sum can be rewritten as \\( S = \\frac{k^{t+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\). For a given \\( n \\), we need to check if there exists integers \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( t \\geq 1 \\) such that \\( n = \\frac{k^{t+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\).\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each possible \\( t \\) (number of expansions), we can determine the range of \\( k \\) values that might satisfy the equation. Given the constraints \\( n \\leq 10^{18} \\), \\( t \\) can be at most around 60 because \\( 2^{60} \\) exceeds \\( 10^{18} \\). For each \\( t \\), we perform a binary search over possible \\( k \\) values to see if the equation holds.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each test case:\n   - If \\( n < 7 \\), output \"NO\" immediately since the smallest valid snowflake has 7 vertices (for \\( k = 2 \\), \\( t = 1 \\)).\n   - For \\( n \\geq 7 \\), iterate over possible values of \\( t \\) from 1 to 60. For each \\( t \\), use binary search to find an integer \\( k \\geq 2 \\) such that \\( n = \\frac{k^{t+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\). The binary search bounds for \\( k \\) are derived from \\( k^t \\leq n \\), ensuring \\( k \\) is within a feasible range.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each test case by checking up to 60 values of \\( t \\). For each \\( t \\), it performs a binary search over \\( k \\), which takes logarithmic time relative to the upper bound of \\( k \\). Given the constraints, this approach efficiently handles the problem within feasible time complexity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_case(n):\n    if n < 7:\n        return \"NO\"\n    \n    found = False\n    t_max = 60\n    for t_val in range(1, t_max + 1):\n        low_k = 2\n        high_k = 10**18\n        \n        # Compute an upper bound for k: k^t_val <= n\n        if n > 1:\n            high_k = int(round(n ** (1 / t_val))) + 2\n        \n        while low_k <= high_k:\n            mid_k = (low_k + high_k) // 2\n            try:\n                total = 1\n                term = 1\n                base = mid_k\n                for _ in range(t_val + 1):\n                    term *= base\n                    total = (total * base + 1)\n                if total == n:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                elif total < n:\n                    low_k = mid_k + 1\n                else:\n                    high_k = mid_k - 1\n            except OverflowError:\n                high_k = mid_k - 1\n                continue\n                \n        if found:\n            break\n            \n    return \"YES\" if found else \"NO\"\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results.append(solve_case(n))\n        \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: The function `solve_case` first checks if \\( n \\) is less than 7, in which case it immediately returns \"NO\" since no valid snowflake can be formed.\n2. **Binary Search for Valid \\( k \\)**: For each possible number of expansions \\( t \\) (from 1 to 60), the function performs a binary search to find an integer \\( k \\geq 2 \\) such that the geometric series sum equals \\( n \\).
