And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read the first line to get n and k.\n Then, read the next line which has n integers.\n\n There are (n - k + 1) weeks. For each week, we take k consecutive days and compute the average for that week.\n Then we are to output the overall average of these averages? But note: the example input [3,4,7] with k=2 and n=3 gives two weeks: [3,4] and [4,7]. The average for the first week is (3+4)/2 = 3.5, for the second week (4+7)/2 = 5.5. Then the overall average is (3.5+5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5? But wait, the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n Let me check the example again: \n Input: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\"\n The example says: then the result is 9.0000000000.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"calculate average sleeping time over all weeks.\" \n\n How many weeks? n-k+1 = 3-2+1 = 2 weeks.\n\n But note: the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n What is 9? It's the sum of the sleep times in the two weeks divided by the total number of days? Or the average of the weekly averages?\n\n Alternatively, note: the example does not average the two weekly averages, but rather:\n\n Total sleep over all weeks: \n   Week1: 3+4 = 7 hours\n   Week2: 4+7 = 11 hours\n Then total sleep = 7 + 11 = 18 hours.\n\n But wait, there are two weeks and each week is 2 days, so total days considered is 4? But we only have 3 days.\n\n Actually, the two weeks are overlapping: [day1, day2] and [day2, day3]. So the entire period is 3 days, but the two weeks together use 4 day-slots? That doesn't make sense.\n\n Let me read the problem statement: \"To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks.\"\n\n And the example: if k=2, n=3, then there are 2 weeks.\n\n But how is the overall average defined?\n\n The problem says: \"Output average sleeping time over all weeks.\"\n\n This can be interpreted as: \n   total_sleep = sum_{each week} (sum of sleep in that week)\n   total_weeks = n - k + 1\n\n Then overall average = total_sleep / total_weeks? \n\n But then for the example: total_sleep = 7 + 11 = 18, total_weeks = 2 -> 18/2 = 9.\n\n However, note that the same day might be counted multiple times. In fact, each week is independent and the problem says \"all weeks\", meaning we are averaging the weekly totals (each week being k days) and then dividing by the number of weeks.\n\n But wait, let's think: if we do that, then the answer for the example is 9.0.\n\n Another example: \n   Input: \"1 1\\n10\" -> one week (since n=1, k=1: 1 week) -> average = 10.0.\n\n And the third example: \n   Input: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n\n   There are 8-2+1 = 7 weeks.\n\n   We need to compute the sum of each consecutive two-day period and then add them all up, then divide by 7.\n\n   Let's break down the third example:\n\n   Days: [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]\n\n   Weeks (each two consecutive days):\n\n   Week1: [1,2] -> 3\n   Week2: [2,4] -> 6\n   Week3: [4,100000] -> 100004\n   Week4: [100000,123] -> 100123\n   Week5: [123,456] -> 579\n   Week6: [456,789] -> 1245\n   Week7: [789,1] -> 790\n\n   Total = 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = \n\n   Let me calculate step by step:\n      3+6 = 9\n      9+100004 = 100013\n      100013+100123 = 200136\n      200136+579 = 200715\n      200715+1245 = 201960\n      201960+790 = 202750\n\n   Then average = 202750 / 7 ≈ 28964.2857142857...\n\n   So the example output is 28964.2857142857.\n\n Therefore, the plan:\n\n   Step 1: Read n, k and the list of n integers.\n\n   Step 2: If k == 0: but note k>=1, so skip.\n\n   Step 3: We need to compute the total sleep over all weeks.\n\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n\n        But note: we cannot simply use the entire array because each week is k consecutive days.\n\n        However, we can precompute a prefix sum for the array to quickly compute the sum of any consecutive k days.\n\n        Let prefix[i] = a0 + a1 + ... + a{i-1}\n\n        Then the sum for the week starting at index i (0-indexed) and ending at index i+k-1 is:\n            prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n        Then the total sleep for all weeks is the sum for i from 0 to n-k of (prefix[i+k] - prefix[i])\n\n        Alternatively, we can note that each element a_i is included in multiple weeks.\n\n        Specifically, the first element (index0) is included in the first k weeks? Actually:\n\n          The first week: [0, k-1] -> includes a0\n          The second week: [1, k]   -> does not include a0 unless k>1? Actually, no: the second week starts at index1, so a0 is only in the first week.\n\n        Actually, an element at position i is included in the weeks that start from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k) ? \n\n        But note: \n          The week starting at j must satisfy: j <= i <= j+k-1.\n          => j <= i and j >= i - k + 1, and also j from 0 to n-k.\n\n        So the number of weeks that include a_i is: min(i+1, k, n-i, n-k+1) ??? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the prefix sum method and iterate over the weeks.\n\n        However, note that n and k can be up to 200,000, so iterating over each week (which would be n-k+1 iterations, which can be ~200000) and for each week doing a subtraction from the prefix is acceptable because the prefix is precomputed.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          prefix[0] = 0\n          for i in range(1, n+1):\n              prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n          total_sleep = 0\n          for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n              # The week starting at index i: from i to i+k-1\n              total_sleep += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n          Then average = total_sleep / (n-k+1)\n\n        But wait: is that correct?\n\n        Example: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n          prefix = [0, 3, 7, 14]\n\n          i=0: prefix[2]-prefix[0] = 7 - 0 = 7\n          i=1: prefix[3]-prefix[1] = 14 - 3 = 11\n\n          total_sleep = 7+11 = 18, then 18/(3-2+1)=18/2=9 -> correct.\n\n        Example: n=1, k=1, a=[10]\n          prefix = [0,10]\n          i=0: prefix[1]-prefix[0]=10\n          total_sleep=10, then 10/ (1-1+1)=10/1=10 -> correct.\n\n        Example: n=8, k=2, a=[1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n          We computed total_sleep=202750, and weeks=7, so 202750/7≈28964.2857...\n\n        However, note: we are doing floating point division and we must output with 6 decimal places.\n\n        But the problem says: \"The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6.\"\n\n        We can use float or decimal? But the numbers are integers and the total_sleep is integer, and then we divide by (n-k+1). The maximum total_sleep is (n-k+1)*max(a) * k, which is about 200000 * 10^5 * 200000, which is too big for float? Actually, we are using integers and then converting to float for division? But note: n,k up to 200000, so total_sleep might be as large as 200000*200000*100000 (if k=200000, then n=200000, and each a_i=100000, then each week is 200000*100000, and there is 1 week, so total_sleep=20000000000000). This is 2e13, which is within the range of Python integers (which are arbitrary precision) but when converting to float we might lose precision.\n\n        However, the problem requires absolute or relative error <= 1e-6.\n\n        We can do the division as a float, but note that 2e13 is exactly representable in double? The double precision floating point can represent integers exactly up to 2^53 (about 9e15). So 2e13 is safe.\n\n        But wait: the total_sleep is the sum of (n-k+1) terms, each term is the sum of k integers. The maximum value of a term is k * 100000, and there are (n-k+1) terms, so maximum total_sleep is (n-k+1) * k * 100000. With n,k up to 200000, the maximum total_sleep is about 200000 * 200000 * 100000 = 4e15, which is still less than 2^53 (9e15). So we can use float for the total_sleep and then divide by (n-k+1) as a float.\n\n        However, to avoid floating point inaccuracies, we can use integer arithmetic until the last division? But the problem requires high precision.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          total_sleep = integer (exact)\n          weeks = n-k+1\n\n          Then average = total_sleep / weeks   (as float)\n\n        But note: total_sleep might be very large, but the division is exact in decimal representation? Not necessarily, but the problem allows absolute or relative error <= 1e-6.\n\n        Since we are using floating point, and the numbers are integers, we can use:\n\n          average = total_sleep / float(weeks)\n\n        But wait, we can also use integer division and then format the output? However, the problem requires a real number.\n\n        But note: the total_sleep might not be divisible by weeks, so we have to use floating point.\n\n        However, there's another approach: we can use the fact that the entire array is being used in overlapping windows, and we can use a sliding window to compute the total_sleep without storing the entire prefix array (we only need the prefix once). \n\n        But the above method with the prefix array is O(n) in memory and time, and n is 200000, so it's acceptable.\n\n        However, we can also compute the total_sleep without building the entire prefix array if we want to save memory, but 200000 integers is acceptable.\n\n        Let me code with the prefix sum.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          n, k = map(int, input().split())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n          # Build prefix sum array of length n+1\n          prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n          for i in range(1, n+1):\n              prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n          total_weeks = n - k + 1\n          total_sleep = 0\n          # Iterate for each week: from index 0 to total_weeks-1\n          for i in range(total_weeks):\n              # The week starting at i: from index i to i+k-1\n              # The sum is prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n              total_sleep += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n          # Now compute average\n          average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n\n          # Format the output to have 10 decimal places, but remove trailing zeros? The problem says output with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n          # We can use formatting to show 9 digits after the decimal, but the example outputs 10.\n\n          # Example: print('%.10f' % average)\n\n          # However, note that the example outputs: '9.0000000000'\n\n          # But if we use formatting, it will output 10 decimal places.\n\n          print('%.10f' % average)\n\n        But wait, what if the average is an integer? We want to output 9.0000000000.\n\n        The formatting '%.10f' does that.\n\n        However, we can also consider performance: building a prefix array of size n+1 and then looping over total_weeks (which is about n) is O(n). Since n is 200000, it's acceptable.\n\n        But note: we are reading from stdin and writing to stdout.\n\n        Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7] -> output 9.0000000000.\n\n        Example 2: n=1, k=1, a=[10] -> output 10.0000000000.\n\n        Example 3: n=8, k=2, a=[1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1] -> output 28964.2857142857.\n\n        However, note: the example output is '28964.2857142857', which is 10 decimal places.\n\n        But wait, the example output string is given as: '28964.2857142857'\n\n        Our formatting '%.10f' will output 10 digits after the decimal. The example output has 10 digits.\n\n        But note: the example output for the first example is '9.0000000000' which is 10 digits.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point\", but our formatting gives exactly 10.\n\n        That's acceptable.\n\n        But wait: there's an alternative way without building the entire prefix array?\n\n        We can use a sliding window to compute the total_sleep.\n\n        total_sleep = 0\n        # First window: from 0 to k-1\n        current_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n        total_sleep += current_sum\n\n        Then for i in range(1, total_weeks):\n            # Subtract a[i-1] and add a[i+k-1] if i+k-1 < n?\n            # But note: the next window starts at i, so we remove the element at index i-1 and add the element at index i+k-1.\n\n            # However, we are iterating for i from 1 to total_weeks-1, and total_weeks = n-k+1, so the last window starts at n-k.\n\n            # We can do:\n\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]   # but wait, the window for i starts at i, so we are removing the element that is leaving (the first element of the previous window) and adding the new element (the one at the end).\n\n            But note: the windows are consecutive and we are moving one element at a time.\n\n            However, the first window uses indices 0 to k-1.\n\n            Then the next window uses indices 1 to k: so we subtract a[0] and add a[k].\n\n            Then the next window: indices 2 to k+1: subtract a[1] and add a[k+1].\n\n            So the formula: \n                current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n\n            But wait, when i increases by 1, the left index moves from i-1 to i, so we remove the element that was at i-1 (which is the first element of the previous window) and add the element at i+k-1 (the next element after the previous window).\n\n            However, note: the window for i=0: indices [0, k-1]\n            i=1: indices [1, k] -> remove index0, add index k.\n\n            Then i=2: remove index1, add index k+1.\n\n            And so on until i = n-k.\n\n            Then total_sleep = sum of all current_sum for i from 0 to n-k.\n\n            This is also O(n) and avoids building the prefix array.\n\n        Let me compare:\n\n          Original method: O(n) time and O(n) space.\n          Sliding window: O(n) time and O(1) extra space.\n\n        Which one to choose? Since n can be up to 200000, both are acceptable, but the sliding window is more memory efficient.\n\n        Steps for sliding window:\n\n          n, k = map(int, input().split())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n          total_weeks = n - k + 1\n          if total_weeks == 0:\n              # But k<=n, so this won't happen.\n              print(0.0)\n              exit(0)\n\n          # Compute the first window\n          current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n          total_sleep = current_sum\n\n          # Then for the next windows\n          for i in range(1, total_weeks):\n              # Remove the element that is leaving: the element at index i-1\n              # Add the element that is entering: the element at index i+k-1\n              current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n              total_sleep += current_sum\n\n          average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n\n          print('%.10f' % average)\n\n        But wait, the first window is from 0 to k-1, then the next window is from 1 to k, then from 2 to k+1, etc.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        However, note: the total_sleep we are computing is the same as the prefix method.\n\n        Let me test the sliding window with the example [3,4,7], k=2:\n\n          total_weeks = 3-2+1 = 2.\n\n          First window: i=0: current_sum = 3+4 = 7, total_sleep=7.\n\n          Then i=1: current_sum = 7 - a[0] + a[1+2-1] = 7 - 3 + a[2] = 7-3+7 = 11, total_sleep=7+11=18.\n\n          Then average = 18/2 = 9.0 -> correct.\n\n        Example: n=1, k=1: \n          total_weeks=1\n          current_sum = a[0] = 10\n          total_sleep=10\n          average=10/1=10.0 -> correct.\n\n        Example: n=8, k=2: \n          We'll compute the first window: [1,2] -> 3\n          Then next windows: \n            i=1: 3 - a[0] + a[1+2-1] = 3 - 1 + a[2] = 3-1+4 = 6\n            i=2: 6 - a[1] + a[3] = 6-2+100000 = 100004\n            i=3: 100004 - a[2] + a[4] = 100004-4+123 = 100123\n            i=4: 100123 - a[3] + a[5] = 100123-100000+456 = 1245+123? Wait, 100123-100000=123, then 123+456=579 -> 579\n            i=5: 579 - a[4] + a[6] = 579-123+456+789? Wait, let's do step by step:\n\n            Actually, the array is [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n\n            i=0: [1,2] -> 3\n            i=1: [2,4] -> 6\n            i=2: [4,100000] -> 100004\n            i=3: [100000,123] -> 100123\n            i=4: [123,456] -> 579\n            i=5: [456,789] -> 1245\n            i=6: [789,1] -> 790\n\n            total_sleep = 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = 202750\n\n            Then 202750/7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n        So the sliding window method is correct.\n\n        However, note: the indexing in the removal and addition:\n\n          We remove the element at index i-1 (because the window moves from [i-1, i+k-2] to [i, i+k-1], so the element at index i-1 leaves).\n\n          We add the element at index i+k-1 (the new rightmost element).\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But note: the first window uses indices [0, k-1]. Then the next window [1, k] (so the next index after k-1 is k, so we add a[k]). \n\n        The index for the new element is i+k-1, and i is the current window index (starting from 0). When i=0, we don't use the addition in the loop (we did the first window separately). Then for i=1, we use i+k-1 = 1+2-1=2, which is the third element (index2) in the array [0-indexed: 0,1,2,...]. \n\n        However, in the example, the array has 8 elements: indices 0 to 7.\n\n        For i=6 (last window): we use i+k-1 = 6+2-1 = 7, which is the last element.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        So we'll use the sliding window method to save memory.\n\n        Code:\n\n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        # If there's only one week, then we just use the first window.\n\n        # Edge: k==0? but k>=1.\n\n        if k == 0:\n            # According to the problem k>=1, so skip.\n            pass\n\n        # If k==n, then we have one window: the entire array.\n        # But we can handle with the same code.\n\n        # Compute the first window\n        if k > 0:\n            total_sleep = sum(a[:k])\n            current_sum = total_sleep\n        else:\n            current_sum = 0\n\n        # If there is only one week, then we don't enter the loop.\n        for i in range(1, total_weeks):\n            # Remove the element that is leaving: at index i-1\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n            total_sleep += current_sum\n\n        average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n\n        print('%.10f' % average)\n\n        However, wait: what if k==0? The problem states k>=1, so we don't need to handle that.\n\n        But note: the problem says 1<=k<=n.\n\n        We can assume k>=1.\n\n        But wait: what if k==0? Then we are removing and adding at the same index? But k>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n        However, the above code for the first window: if k==0, then a[:k] is a[0:0] -> empty list, so sum is 0. Then we try to remove a[-1] (if i>=1) which would be the last element? That's bad.\n\n        Since k>=1, we are safe.\n\n        But what if k==n? Then total_weeks = n - n + 1 = 1, so the for loop runs from 1 to 0 (so no iteration). Correct.\n\n        Let me test with k=n=3, a=[1,2,3]:\n          total_weeks=1\n          total_sleep = sum([1,2,3]) = 6\n          average = 6/1 = 6.0 -> correct.\n\n        One more test: n=4, k=2, a=[1,2,3,4]\n          total_weeks=3\n          First window: [1,2] -> 3\n          Then i=1: current_sum = 3 - a[0] + a[1+2-1] = 3-1+a[2]=3-1+3=5; total_sleep=3+5=8\n          Then i=2: current_sum = 5 - a[1] + a[2+2-1] = 5-2+a[3]=5-2+4=7; total_sleep=8+7=15\n          average=15/3=5.0\n\n          Check manually: \n            Week1: [1,2] -> 3\n            Week2: [2,3] -> 5\n            Week3: [3,4] -> 7\n            Sum=3+5+7=15, average=5 -> correct.\n\n        Therefore, we can write the code as above.\n\n        However, note: the problem constraints say n and k can be up to 200000. The sum(a[:k]) for the first window: if k is 200000, then we are creating a slice of 200000 elements and summing them. This is O(k) and k can be 200000, which is acceptable because 200000 operations is acceptable in Python.\n\n        But note: the entire algorithm is O(n) because the for loop runs (n-k+1) times, and each step is O(1). The initial sum is O(k). So overall O(n+k) which is acceptable since n and k are up to 200000.\n\n        But wait, what if k is 200000 and n is 200000? Then the initial sum is O(200000) and the for loop runs 1 time (since n-k+1=1). So total operations is about 200000 (for the initial sum) + 0 (for the loop) = 200000.\n\n        If k is 1 and n is 200000, then the initial sum is O(1) and the for loop runs 199999 times, which is acceptable.\n\n        So we are good.\n\n        Let me run the code with the sample inputs.\n\n        Sample 1: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\"\n          n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n          total_weeks=2\n          total_sleep = 3+4 = 7\n          Then i=1: current_sum = 7 - a[0] + a[1+2-1] = 7-3+a[2]=4+7=11 -> total_sleep=7+11=18\n          average=18/2=9.0 -> prints \"9.0000000000\"\n\n        Sample 2: \"1 1\\n10\"\n          n=1, k=1, a=[10]\n          total_weeks=1\n          total_sleep=10\n          no loop -> average=10.0 -> \"10.0000000000\"\n\n        Sample 3: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n          total_weeks=7\n          total_sleep = 1+2=3\n          Then i=1: 3-1+a[2]=3-1+4=6 -> total_sleep=9\n          i=2: 6-2+a[3]=6-2+100000=100004 -> total_sleep=100013\n          i=3: 100004-4+a[4]=100004-4+123=100123 -> total_sleep=200136\n          i=4: 100123-100000+a[5]=100123-100000+456=579 -> total_sleep=200715\n          i=5: 579-123+a[6]=579-123+456=912? Wait, wait: \n                Actually, the array is [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n                i=4: we are at the fifth window (i=4, so the window is from index4 to index5: [123,456] -> sum=579, which is correct.\n                Then i=5: remove a[4] (which is 123) and add a[5+2-1]=a[6] (which is 789) -> 579-123+789 = 579+789-123 = 1368-123=1245 -> correct.\n          i=6: remove a[5] (which is 456) and add a[7] (which is 1) -> 1245-456+1=790 -> correct.\n\n          Then total_sleep=3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = 202750\n\n          Then 202750/7 = 28964.2857142857... -> correct.\n\n        However, wait: I see in the above calculation for i=5: \n          current_sum at the beginning of the loop for i=5 is the value from the previous window (i=4) which was 579.\n          Then we do: current_sum = 579 - a[4] + a[6] = 579 - 123 + 789.\n\n          But wait, a[4] is the element at index4: which is 123, and a[6] is 789.\n\n          So 579-123+789 = 579+789-123 = 1368-123=1245 -> correct.\n\n        But wait, the window for i=5 is [456,789] (since i=5: indices from 5 to 5+2-1=6). The element at index5 is 456 and index6 is 789. \n\n        However, in the sliding window, we are storing the current_sum for the window starting at i=4 (which was [123,456]) and then for i=5 we remove the element that was at the beginning of the window (which is 123) and add the new element at the end (which is 789). \n\n        But the window for i=5 should be [456,789]. Why did we remove 123? \n\n        Actually, the window for i=0: [0,1]\n        i=1: [1,2]\n        i=2: [2,3]\n        i=3: [3,4]\n        i=4: [4,5]\n        i=5: [5,6]\n\n        The element 123 is at index4, so when we move from i=4 to i=5, the element that leaves is the one at index4 (which is 123) and the one that enters is at index6 (789). \n\n        But wait, the window for i=5 is [5,6] (indices5 and6). So the element at index4 (123) is not even in the window for i=5. \n\n        Correction: \n\n          The window for i=4: [4,5] -> indices4 and5: [123,456]\n          The window for i=5: [5,6] -> indices5 and6: [456,789]\n\n        So the element that leaves is the one at the beginning of the previous window? Actually, the previous window (i=4) had [4,5] (indices4 and5). The next window (i=5) is [5,6]. So we remove the element at index4 (which is 123) and add the element at index6 (789). \n\n        But wait, the element at index5 (456) is still there. \n\n        This is correct because the window shifts: the previous window started at index4 and ended at index5. The next window starts at index5 and ends at index6. So the element at index5 is still in the window. \n\n        The element that leaves is the one that was at the beginning of the previous window (index4) and the one that enters is the one at the end of the next window (index6). \n\n        So the sliding window method is correct.\n\n        However, note: the element that leaves is the one that is at the start of the previous window, and the element that enters is the one at the end of the next window.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        But note: the indexing for the array a: \n          a[0] is the first element.\n\n        We are using 0-indexed.\n\n        Final code:\n\n        Read input, compute the total_sleep by sliding window",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible consecutive k-day periods (weeks) in a given sequence of sleep times. The solution involves efficiently summing the sleep times for each week and then computing the average.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires processing a sequence of sleep times and calculating the average sleep time over all possible consecutive k-day periods (windows). Each window's average is derived from the sum of its elements, and the overall average is the sum of all window sums divided by the number of windows.\n2. **Intuition**: The key observation is that each window is a sliding window of size k. The sum of each window can be computed efficiently using a sliding window technique, which avoids recalculating sums from scratch for each window.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a sliding window approach:\n   - **Initial Window**: Compute the sum of the first k elements.\n   - **Subsequent Windows**: For each subsequent window, subtract the element that exits the window and add the new element entering the window.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of days, because each element is processed exactly once (either in the initial window or during the sliding phase). The space complexity is O(1) as we only store the current window sum and total sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    \n    if total_weeks == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n        \n    total_sleep = sum(a[:k])\n    current_sum = total_sleep\n    \n    for i in range(1, total_weeks):\n        current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n        total_sleep += current_sum\n        \n    average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n    print('%.10f' % average)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of days (n), the window size (k), and the sequence of sleep times.\n2. **Initial Setup**: The total number of windows (weeks) is calculated as `n - k + 1`. If there are no windows (though constraints prevent this), the output is set to 0.\n3. **Sliding Window Technique**:\n   - **Initial Window**: The sum of the first k elements is computed.\n   - **Window Sliding**: For each subsequent window, the leftmost element of the previous window is subtracted, and the new rightmost element is added. This adjustment is done in constant time per window.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The total sum of all window sums is divided by the number of windows to get the average, formatted to 10 decimal places for precision.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average by leveraging the sliding window technique, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
