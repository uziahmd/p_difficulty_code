Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, and then n lines of n characters each.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. On both diagonals, all letters are the same (so the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal must be composed of the same letter, say 'x').\n 2. All other squares (not on diagonals) must contain the same letter, which is different from the one on the diagonals.\n\n However, note: the example input includes:\n   Example 1: n=5, with pattern:\n        xooox\n        oxoxo\n        soxoo\n        oxoxo\n        xooox\n      This outputs \"NO\" because at the center (which is on both diagonals) we have 's' but the diagonal requires the same letter? Actually, let's break down:\n\n In the example, the main diagonal is: \n   positions: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4): letters 'x','o','s','o','x'\n   -> Not all same.\n\n But wait, the example output is \"NO\", and the example input has a center that is 's'. \n\n Actually, the problem states:\n   - Both diagonals must have the same letter (and that letter must be the same throughout the entire diagonal).\n   - The rest must be another fixed letter (same for all non-diagonal cells) and different from the diagonal letter.\n\n Steps:\n\n Let's define:\n   Let the diagonal letter be `d`.\n   Let the non-diagonal letter be `c`.\n\n Conditions to check:\n 1. For every cell (i, j) on the main diagonal (i.e., i == j) and anti-diagonal (i+j == n-1), the letter must be the same, say `d`.\n 2. For every cell (i, j) not on either diagonal, the letter must be the same, say `c`, and `c != d`.\n\n But note: the two diagonals might have different letters? The problem says \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\", meaning each diagonal has one letter, and the condition does not explicitly say that the two diagonals must have the same letter. However, reading the example: in the second example, the diagonals are the same letter (here 'w') and the non-diagonals are 's'.\n\n Let me re-read: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". So each diagonal must be uniform. Then the problem doesn't say the two diagonals must be the same. But wait, the letter 'X' typically has the same color (or letter) for both diagonals. Moreover, the example test case 2: \n        Input: 3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\n        Output: YES\n\n Here, the main diagonal: ['w','s','w'] -> not the same! Wait, no: actually the main diagonal of a 3x3 matrix is [w, s, w] — that's not the same. But wait, the example output is \"YES\".\n\n Let me clarify: the problem says \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". \n\n In the example:\n        w s w\n        s w s\n        w s w\n\n The main diagonal: (0,0)='w', (1,1)='w', (2,2)='w' — wait, actually I see: the example input is given as:\n        wsw\n        sws\n        wsw\n\n So the grid is:\n        row0: 'w','s','w'\n        row1: 's','w','s'\n        row2: 'w','s','w'\n\n Now, the main diagonal: (0,0)='w', (1,1)='w', (2,2)='w' -> all 'w'.\n The anti-diagonal: (0,2)='w', (1,1)='w', (2,0)='w' -> all 'w'. \n\n But wait, the center is shared by both diagonals. So the center must be the same for both. Therefore, the two diagonals must have the same letter? Actually, the problem does not explicitly require the two diagonals to have the same letter, but the center is part of both. So the entire set of diagonal cells must be the same letter? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". It doesn't say the two diagonals must be the same as each other, but note: if the center is included in both, then the center must be the same as the main diagonal and also the same as the anti-diagonal. Therefore, the entire union of the two diagonals must be the same letter.\n\n However, consider: what if the two diagonals have different letters? Then the center would have to be two letters at once, which is impossible. So actually, the two diagonals must be composed of the same letter.\n\n So the condition for the diagonals: \n   For all (i, j) such that i==j OR i+j == n-1, the letter must be the same (say `d`).\n\n Then, for the rest of the cells, they must all be the same letter (say `c`) and `c != d`.\n\n How to do it:\n\n Step 1: Read n and the grid.\n\n Step 2: Check the diagonals:\n   Let d = None\n   Traverse the main diagonal: for i in range(n): cell = grid[i][i]\n   Then traverse the anti-diagonal: for i in range(n): cell = grid[i][n-1-i]\n\n   However, if we find two different letters in the diagonals, then we can break early.\n\n   But note: the center is counted in both. We can do:\n     Let d_set = set()\n     For i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][i] != grid[0][0]:\n            Then set d = grid[0][0] and then check the rest? Actually, we want to know if all diagonal cells are the same.\n\n   Alternatively, we can collect all diagonal cells and check if they are the same.\n\n   However, note: we don't know the letter until we check. But the condition is that the entire diagonal (both) must be the same.\n\n   Let d_letter = grid[0][0]\n   Then for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][i] != d_letter -> then NO for diagonals?\n        and if grid[i][n-1-i] != d_letter -> then NO for diagonals?\n\n   But wait: the entire diagonal must be the same, but what if the two diagonals have different letters? Then we need to check both independently? Actually, no: the center must be in both, so if the main diagonal is uniform and the anti-diagonal is uniform, then the center is the same for both. However, the main diagonal and anti-diagonal might have different letters at the center? Then the center must be the same for both, so the two diagonals must have the same letter.\n\n   Actually, the problem requires that both diagonals are uniform, but does not require that the two diagonals have the same letter? Let me read again: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". This means the main diagonal has the same letter, and the anti-diagonal has the same letter (which could be different). But then the center (common cell) must be the same letter for both diagonals, so the two diagonals must have the same letter.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n   Condition 1: The main diagonal has all the same letter, say d1.\n   Condition 2: The anti-diagonal has all the same letter, say d2.\n   Condition 3: d1 == d2.\n\n   Then the letter for the diagonals is d = d1 = d2.\n\n   Alternatively, we can just check the entire set of diagonal cells (including both) and see if they are all the same.\n\n   Since the center is included in both, we can combine the two diagonals and check if all are the same.\n\n   Let diag_letters = set()\n   For i in range(n):\n        diag_letters.add(grid[i][i])\n        diag_letters.add(grid[i][n-1-i])\n\n   Then if the set diag_letters has size 1, then the diagonals are uniform and same letter.\n\n   However, wait: if the main diagonal has one letter and the anti-diagonal has a different letter, then the set will have size 2. But note: the center is common. So the center is the only common element. But if the main diagonal is all 'a' and the anti-diagonal is all 'b', then the center must be both 'a' and 'b', which is impossible. Therefore, the set diag_letters must be of size 1.\n\n   So we can check: \n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][i] != grid[0][0] or grid[i][n-1-i] != grid[0][0]:\n                Then we break and say NO.\n\n   But note: the center is at i = (n-1)//2, and we are checking both the main and anti-diagonal at the same time. However, we are using grid[0][0] as the reference. But the anti-diagonal's starting point is grid[0][n-1] which may not be grid[0][0]. \n\n   Let me think: \n        We require that the entire main diagonal is the same. So the main diagonal must be the same as grid[0][0].\n        Similarly, the entire anti-diagonal must be the same. But the anti-diagonal starts at grid[0][n-1] and goes to grid[(n-1)//2][(n-1)//2] and then to grid[n-1][0].\n\n   So we cannot use grid[0][0] as the reference for the anti-diagonal? \n\n   Actually, we can: because the center must be the same for both. So if the main diagonal is uniform and the anti-diagonal is uniform, then the entire set of diagonal cells must be the same.\n\n   However, we can check separately:\n\n   Option 1: Check main diagonal: all(grid[i][i] == grid[0][0] for i in range(n))\n   Option 2: Check anti-diagonal: all(grid[i][n-1-i] == grid[0][0] for i in range(n))\n\n   Then if both are true, then the diagonals are uniform and the letter is grid[0][0].\n\n   But wait: what if the main diagonal is uniform but not the same as grid[0][0]? That's not possible because grid[0][0] is part of the main diagonal.\n\n   However, what if the grid[0][0] is correct for the main diagonal, but the anti-diagonal is uniform but with a different letter? Then the condition above for the anti-diagonal would fail because we are comparing to grid[0][0]. \n\n   Example: \n        grid = [\n            ['a','b','c'],\n            ['d','e','f'],\n            ['g','h','i']\n        ]\n\n        Main diagonal: ['a','e','i'] -> if we set d_letter = 'a', then we require the anti-diagonal to be ['c','e','g'] to be all 'a'? No, so this fails.\n\n   But note: the condition is that both diagonals are uniform. It doesn't require that the two diagonals have the same letter? Actually, the problem says \"all letters are the same\" for each diagonal. So the main diagonal must be uniform and the anti-diagonal must be uniform, but they can be different. However, the center is common, so the center must be the same letter for both. Therefore, the two diagonals must have the same letter.\n\n   Therefore, the above two conditions (main diagonal uniform and anti-diagonal uniform) are necessary, but we must also ensure that the two diagonals have the same letter. \n\n   Alternatively, we can check the entire set of diagonal cells (without assuming grid[0][0] is the one) by:\n\n        d_set = set()\n        for i in range(n):\n            d_set.add(grid[i][i])\n            d_set.add(grid[i][n-1-i])\n\n        if len(d_set) != 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n   But wait, this set includes every cell on both diagonals. However, if the two diagonals have the same letter, then the set will have one element. If they have different letters, then the set will have at least two elements (unless the center is the only common element and the two diagonals have the same center, but then the entire main diagonal must be that center and the entire anti-diagonal must be that center). \n\n   However, the above set method is simpler.\n\n   But note: the center is added twice (same value) so that's okay.\n\n   So:\n\n        d_letter = None\n        for i in range(n):\n            # For main diagonal\n            if grid[i][i] != grid[0][0]:\n                d_letter = grid[i][i]   # we don't really need to store multiple, we are going to check the entire set anyway.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][i] != grid[0][0] or grid[i][n-1-i] != grid[0][0]):\n                # But wait, the anti-diagonal: we are comparing to grid[0][0] which is the top-left. Is that valid for the anti-diagonal?\n                # The anti-diagonal must be uniform, but the top-right might be different from grid[0][0]. However, the center must be the same as grid[0][0] for the main diagonal, and the center must be the same for the anti-diagonal. So if grid[0][0] is the letter for the main diagonal, then the entire anti-diagonal must be grid[0][0] as well? \n\n        Actually, no: consider the example with n=3:\n                w s w\n                s w s\n                w s w\n\n        The main diagonal: ['w','w','w'] -> so grid[0][0]=='w'. The anti-diagonal: ['w','w','w'] -> so each element must be 'w'. But wait, the anti-diagonal: \n                row0, col2: 'w'\n                row1, col1: 'w' (this is the center, so must be same as main diagonal)\n                row2, col0: 'w'\n\n        So the anti-diagonal must be 'w'. \n\n        But what if the grid is:\n\n                a b c\n                d e f\n                g h i\n\n        Then main diagonal: a, e, i -> must be same, say a=e=i=x.\n        Anti-diagonal: c, e, g -> must be same, say c=e=g=y.\n\n        Then the center e must be both x and y -> so x must equal y.\n\n        Therefore, the two diagonals must have the same letter.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        Step 1: Check that all main diagonal elements are the same (say d1) and all anti-diagonal elements are the same (say d2). Then check d1 == d2.\n\n        Alternatively, we can simply check that all diagonal cells (the set of cells (i,i) and (i, n-1-i)) are the same.\n\n        Let d_set = {grid[i][i] for i in range(n)} | {grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)}\n        if len(d_set) != 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n\n   Step 3: Now, for the non-diagonal cells, we need to check two things:\n        a) All non-diagonal cells must be the same letter (say c).\n        b) c != d (where d is the letter from the diagonals, which is the only element in d_set).\n\n   However, note: the non-diagonal cells might have multiple distinct letters? So we need to check that all non-diagonal cells are the same.\n\n   How to check non-diagonal cells?\n        We can iterate over every cell (i, j) that is not on the main diagonal and not on the anti-diagonal.\n\n        We can do:\n\n        non_diag_letter = None\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    continue\n                if non_diag_letter is None:\n                    non_diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n                else:\n                    if grid[i][j] != non_diag_letter:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        return\n\n        Then, after that, check that non_diag_letter != d (where d is the diagonal letter, which we can take as the first element of d_set, or we can use the fact that d_set has one element).\n\n   However, note: we have already checked that the entire diagonal set is one letter, so d = next(iter(d_set))\n\n   But wait: what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Then n=1, but n>=3 and odd, so no problem.\n\n   But note: the above nested loops for non-diagonal cells: we are iterating through every cell and skipping the diagonals. Then we check that all the non-diagonal cells are the same.\n\n   However, we must also ensure that the non-diagonal letter is different from the diagonal letter.\n\n   So:\n\n        Step 1: Check the diagonals (both) are uniform and the same letter. If not, output \"NO\".\n        Step 2: Check all non-diagonal cells are the same letter, and that letter is different from the diagonal letter.\n\n   But note: what if the non-diagonal cells are not uniform? Then we break and output \"NO\".\n\n   However, there's a catch: the non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from the diagonal. But what if the non-diagonal cells are uniform but equal to the diagonal letter? Then condition (b) fails.\n\n   Example: \n        n=3, grid:\n            ['x','x','x']\n            ['x','x','x']\n            ['x','x','x']\n\n        Diagonals: set of diagonal cells: {'x'} -> uniform.\n        Non-diagonals: all 'x', so non_diag_letter is 'x', which is same as diagonal -> condition (b) fails -> \"NO\".\n\n   Another example: \n        n=3, grid:\n            ['a','a','a']\n            ['a','a','a']\n            ['a','a','a']\n\n        Diagonals: set(diag) = {'a'}, non_diag_letter = 'a' -> same -> \"NO\".\n\n   So the condition is strict.\n\n   But wait: the problem says: \n        \"all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\n   So we must have two distinct letters: one for the diagonals and one for the rest.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        grid = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            line = input().strip()\n            grid.append(line)\n\n        # Step 1: Check the diagonals\n        diag_set = set()\n        for i in range(n):\n            diag_set.add(grid[i][i])\n            diag_set.add(grid[i][n-1-i])\n\n        if len(diag_set) != 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        d_letter = next(iter(diag_set))\n\n        # Step 2: Check non-diagonal cells\n        non_diag_letter = None\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    continue\n                if non_diag_letter is None:\n                    non_diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n                else:\n                    if grid[i][j] != non_diag_letter:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        exit(0)\n\n        # Now, check that non_diag_letter is defined (there is at least one non-diagonal cell) and that it is different from d_letter.\n        if non_diag_letter is None:\n            # This means there are no non-diagonal cells, which happens when n=1, but n>=3 so we don't have to worry, but for safety.\n            print(\"NO\")   # Actually, for n>=3, there will be non-diagonal cells. But if n==1, then we skip the non-diagonal part and then we get None. But n>=3, so we can ignore.\n        else:\n            if non_diag_letter == d_letter:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n   However, note: the problem says n>=3 and odd, so the smallest n is 3, which has 9 cells and 2*(3)-1 = 5 diagonal cells (overlapping at center) so 4 non-diagonal cells. So non_diag_letter will be defined.\n\n   But let me test with n=3 and the example that should be \"YES\":\n\n        Example: \n            n=3, grid = \n                \"wsw\"\n                \"sws\"\n                \"wsw\"\n\n        Diagonals: \n            main: grid[0][0]='w', grid[1][1]='w', grid[2][2]='w'\n            anti: grid[0][2]='w', grid[1][1]='w', grid[2][0]='w'\n            diag_set = {'w'} -> condition holds.\n\n        Now, non-diagonal cells: \n            (0,1): 's'\n            (1,0): 's'\n            (1,2): 's'\n            (2,1): 's'\n\n        So non_diag_letter is set to 's'. Then we check that all non-diagonal are 's' -> yes. Then check 's' != 'w' -> yes. So output \"YES\".\n\n   Example that should be \"NO\": \n        Input: 3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\n\n        n=3, grid:\n            \"xpx\"\n            \"pxp\"\n            \"xpe\"\n\n        Diagonals:\n            main: 'x','p','e' -> set has {'x','p','e'} -> len(diag_set)=3 -> NO.\n\n        But wait, the example output is \"NO\", and our code outputs \"NO\" at the first condition.\n\n   Another example from the input: \n        Input: 5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox\n\n        Diagonals:\n            main: \n                row0: 'x'\n                row1: 'o'\n                row2: 's'\n                row3: 'o'\n                row4: 'x'\n                -> set: {'x','o','s'} -> size 3 -> \"NO\"\n\n        Which matches the example.\n\n   However, wait: the example input provided was:\n\n        ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n        Expected output: ['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\n   Our code correctly outputs:\n        For the first: \"NO\"\n        For the second: \"YES\"\n        For the third: \"NO\"\n\n   But wait, the third example: \n        \"3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\"\n\n        The main diagonal: ['x','p','e'] -> not uniform -> so we output \"NO\".\n\n   However, the example input string for the third example is exactly that.\n\n   But wait, the example input description says: \n        Input: \n            ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n        Output: \n            ['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   However, note: the example input format is given as a list of strings, but in our program we read from stdin.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   But wait: the example input is given as three separate strings? Actually, the example input is provided as a list of strings, but the actual input to the program is:\n\n        First line: integer n\n        Next n lines: each of n characters.\n\n   So the example input \"3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\" is provided as:\n\n        First line: \"3\"\n        Second line: \"wsw\"\n        Third line: \"sws\"\n        Fourth line: \"wsw\"\n\n   But in the example, it's given as a string that has newlines. However, the way we read is:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        grid = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            grid.append(input().strip())\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   However, note: the example input \"3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\" is:\n\n        n=3\n        grid[0] = \"xpx\"\n        grid[1] = \"pxp\"\n        grid[2] = \"xpe\"\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait: the example input provided in the problem statement is:\n\n        Input:\n            ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n        Output:\n            ['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\n   However, note that the input format is one integer n and then n lines. The example input is given as a list of strings, each string being a complete test case including the n and the next n lines. But in the problem, we are to read from stdin.\n\n   We assume the input is given as described.\n\n   Let me run the code with the provided examples.\n\n   But note: the example input \"3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\" is actually:\n\n        Line1: \"3\"\n        Line2: \"wsw\"\n        Line3: \"sws\"\n        Line4: \"wsw\"\n\n   However, wait: the example input is given as a string that has embedded newlines. But in the problem, the input is given as:\n\n        The first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters.\n\n   So the input for the second example is:\n\n        3\n        wsw\n        sws\n        wsw\n\n   And for the third example:\n\n        3\n        xpx\n        pxx   -> wait, wait! The example third input is: \"3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\", so the third line is \"pxp\", and the fourth is \"xpe\"? \n\n   Actually, the example third input is:\n\n        3\n        xpx\n        pxx   -> wait, the example says \"3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\", meaning:\n\n        Line1: \"3\"\n        Line2: \"xpx\"\n        Line3: \"pxp\"\n        Line4: \"xpe\"\n\n   But wait, n=3, so we only expect 3 lines. \n\n   Correction: The example input string is:\n\n        '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe'\n\n   This is a string that represents:\n\n        First token: \"3\" (then newline)\n        Then \"xpx\" (then newline)\n        Then \"pxp\" (then newline)\n        Then \"xpe\"\n\n   But wait, that's four lines. However, the problem says: the first line is n, then n lines.\n\n   So n=3, then we expect three lines. But the example string has four lines? \n\n   Let me count the newlines: \n        \"3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\" -> split by newline: [\"3\", \"xpx\", \"pxp\", \"xpe\"] -> 4 tokens.\n\n   This is inconsistent. \n\n   Actually, the example input is given as a string that is the entire input. The problem says:\n\n        Input:\n            ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n   This is a list of three strings, each string representing a test case. The first test case is:\n\n        \"5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox\"\n\n   When we run the program for the first test case, we would:\n\n        Read the first line: \"5\" -> n=5.\n        Then read 5 lines: \n            \"xooox\"\n            \"oxoxo\"\n            \"soxoo\"\n            \"oxoxo\"\n            \"xooox\"\n\n   Similarly, the second test case:\n\n        First line: \"3\"\n        Then 3 lines: \"wsw\", \"sws\", \"wsw\"\n\n   The third test case:\n\n        First line: \"3\"\n        Then 3 lines: \"xpx\", \"pxp\", \"xpe\"\n\n   So the example input string for the third test case is \"3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\", which is:\n\n        Line1: \"3\"\n        Line2: \"xpx\"\n        Line3: \"pxp\"\n        Line4: \"xpe\"\n\n   But wait, that's 4 lines. The problem says: each of the next n lines. For n=3, we only need 3 lines.\n\n   There seems to be a discrepancy. \n\n   Actually, the example input string provided in the problem statement is:\n\n        ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n   Each element of the list is a string that includes the integer n and then n lines (each line being n characters). \n\n   But the third element: \"3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\" has 3 lines after the first line? \n\n   Let me break down the third string: \n        \"3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\" -> \n        Line1: \"3\"\n        Line2: \"xpx\"\n        Line3: \"pxp\"\n        Line4: \"xpe\"\n\n   That's 4 lines. But the problem says the first line is n, and then n lines. So for n=3, we should have 3 more lines, making total 4 lines. \n\n   However, wait: the input specification says:\n\n        The first line contains integer n.\n        Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters.\n\n   So the total lines is 1 + n.\n\n   Therefore, the third test case input should be:\n\n        Line1: \"3\"\n        Line2: \"xpx\"\n        Line3: \"pxp\"\n        Line4: \"xpe\"\n\n   But wait, the second test case: \n        \"3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\" -> \n        Line1: \"3\"\n        Line2: \"wsw\"\n        Line3: \"sws\"\n        Line4: \"wsw\"\n\n   This is 4 lines. So the example input is given as a list of strings that represent the entire input for one test case, including the n and the next n lines.\n\n   Therefore, our program should read:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        grid = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            grid.append(input().strip())\n\n   And then process the grid.\n\n   Now, the example third test case:\n\n        n = 3\n        grid[0] = \"xpx\"\n        grid[1] = \"pxp\"\n        grid[2] = \"xpe\"\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait, the example input string is \"3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\", so when we run the program and feed this as the entire input, it will read:\n\n        First input: \"3\" -> n=3\n        Then three inputs: \"xpx\", \"pxp\", \"xpe\"\n\n   However, the string \"3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\" has three newlines? Actually, no: the string has two newlines: one after \"3\", one after \"xpx\", one after \"pxp\", and then the last part is \"xpe\". \n\n   Actually, the string \"3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\" is:\n\n        \"3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\"\n\n   This is four lines: \n        Line1: \"3\"\n        Line2: \"xpx\"\n        Line3: \"pxp\"\n        Line4: \"xpe\"\n\n   But we are reading n=3, then we try to read 3 lines, and we have 3 more lines (so 4 total). \n\n   The program expects 3 lines after the first line. \n\n   But wait, the example input string is the entire input for one test case. So the test case is:\n\n        Input for the program is:\n            3\n            xpx\n            pxx   -> wait, wait, the example string is \"3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\", so the third line is \"pxp\", and then there is no fourth line? \n\n   Actually, the example string \"3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\" has three lines of data (if we consider the newline as separating the lines) but the first line is \"3\", then the next three are \"xpx\", \"pxp\", \"xpe\". \n\n   How many newlines? \n\n        \"3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\" -> splits into: \n            tokens = ['3', 'xpx', 'pxp', 'xpe']\n\n   So that's 4 tokens. But the problem says the first token is n, then n tokens (each of n characters). \n\n   So for n=3, we expect 3 more tokens. \n\n   Therefore, the example input string for the third test case is:\n\n        \"3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\"\n\n   This is 4 tokens. But the problem says the input has 1+n lines. \n\n   This is a confusion in the problem statement. \n\n   Let me check the example: \n        Example 1: \"5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox\" -> \n            Split: ['5','xooox','oxoxo','soxoo','oxoxo','xooox'] -> 6 tokens, but n=5, so we expect 5 tokens after the first.\n\n   Actually, wait: the first line is n, then the next n lines. So the entire input should be:\n\n        First line: \"5\"\n        Second line: \"xooox\"\n        Third line: \"oxoxo\"\n        Fourth line: \"soxoo\"\n        Fifth line: \"oxoxo\"\n        Sixth line: \"xooox\"\n\n   But wait, that's 6 lines. However, the example input string is written as \"5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox\", which is 5 newlines? \n\n   Actually, the string \"5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox\" has 5 newlines? \n\n   Let me count: \n        \"5\\n\" -> 1 newline\n        then \"xooox\\n\" -> 2nd\n        then \"oxoxo\\n\" -> 3rd\n        then \"soxoo\\n\" -> 4th\n        then \"oxoxo\\n\" -> 5th\n        then \"xooox\" -> no newline at the end? \n\n   Actually, the string ends with \"xooox\", so the last line is not terminated by a newline? \n\n   The problem says: \"Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters.\" \n\n   But in programming, we usually read until we have n lines. The example input is given as a string that includes the newlines.\n\n   However, the way we read: \n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n   This will read n lines. The input() function reads a line (including the newline character? Actually, no: the newline is stripped by the default behavior of input()? \n\n   Actually, the input() function reads until the newline and returns the string without the newline.\n\n   But the example input string is provided with newlines. \n\n   Let me simulate:\n\n        Input string for the first test case: \"5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox\"\n\n        We break it into tokens by the system's line reading.\n\n        First call: input() -> returns \"5\" (without the newline)\n        Then next 5 calls: \n            input() -> \"xooox\"\n            input() -> \"oxoxo\"\n            input() -> \"soxoo\"\n            input() -> \"oxoxo\"\n            input() -> \"xooox\"\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Similarly, the third test case:\n\n        Input string: \"3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\"\n\n        First call: input() -> \"3\"\n        Then 3 calls:\n            input() -> \"xpx\"\n            input() -> \"pxp\"\n            input() -> \"xpe\"\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait, the example input string for the third test case does not have a trailing newline? \n\n        \"3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\" -> \n        After the last line, there's no newline? \n\n   In the problem, the input is given as a string that is the entire input. The last line does not necessarily have a newline? \n\n   However, the input() function in Python will read until the newline. If the last line is not terminated by a newline, then the last input() call will still read the last line.\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters in the grid must be the same as each other but different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the integer `n` (the size of the grid) and then read `n` lines of input to form the grid.\n2. **Check Diagonals**: Verify that all characters on both the main diagonal (where row index equals column index) and the anti-diagonal (where row index plus column index equals `n-1`) are the same. This involves checking every cell on both diagonals to ensure uniformity.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**: Ensure that all cells not on either diagonal are the same character and that this character differs from the diagonal character.\n4. **Output Result**: If both conditions are satisfied, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        grid.append(input().strip())\n    \n    diag_set = set()\n    for i in range(n):\n        diag_set.add(grid[i][i])\n        diag_set.add(grid[i][n-1-i])\n    \n    if len(diag_set) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    d_letter = next(iter(diag_set))\n    \n    non_diag_letter = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            if non_diag_letter is None:\n                non_diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != non_diag_letter:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n                    \n    if non_diag_letter is None:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if non_diag_letter == d_letter:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the integer `n`, which defines the grid size. It then reads `n` lines of input to construct the grid.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: The code checks all cells on the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left). It collects all characters from these diagonals into a set. If the set contains more than one unique character, the grid does not form an \"X\", and the program outputs \"NO\".\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: The code then checks all cells not on the diagonals. It ensures these cells contain the same character, which must differ from the diagonal character. If any cell on the non-diagonal does not match, the program outputs \"NO\".\n4. **Result Output**: If both checks pass, the program outputs \"YES\", confirming the grid forms an \"X\". Otherwise, it outputs \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the conditions for forming an \"X\" by systematically checking each required part of the grid, ensuring correctness with minimal computational overhead.",
