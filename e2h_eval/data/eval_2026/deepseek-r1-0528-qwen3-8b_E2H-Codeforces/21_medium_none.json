The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are going to use the condition: a_i + b_j is odd => (a_i % 2) != (b_j % 2)\n Therefore, we can separate the chests and keys by parity.\n\n Let:\n   Chestes_even = number of chests with even a_i\n   Chestes_odd = number of chests with odd a_i\n\n Similarly for keys:\n   Keys_even = number of keys with even b_j\n   Keys_odd = number of keys with odd b_j\n\n Now, note that an even chest can only be opened by an odd key, and an odd chest can only be opened by an even key.\n\n So, we have two bipartite graphs:\n   - Even chests can be matched with odd keys.\n   - Odd chests can be matched with even keys.\n\n But note: we cannot use a key twice. So the maximum matching from even chests to odd keys is limited by the minimum of:\n     min(chests_even, keys_odd)\n\n Similarly, the maximum matching from odd chests to even keys is limited by:\n     min(chests_odd, keys_even)\n\n However, wait: is that all? Actually, yes, because each chest must be matched by a key of opposite parity and vice versa.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that we use all available keys or chests. We are just to maximize the number of chests opened.\n\n However, there's a catch: we are allowed to assign keys arbitrarily (but one key per chest). The entire matching is independent for the two groups.\n\n Therefore, the total number of chests we can open is:\n     min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)\n\n Let's test with the examples:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \"5 4\", then chests [9,14,6,2,11], keys [8,4,7,20]\n\n   Chests: \n        9 -> odd, 14->even, 6->even, 2->even, 11->odd\n        Chests_even = 3, Chests_odd = 2\n\n   Keys:\n        8 -> even, 4->even, 7->odd, 20->even\n        Keys_even = 3, Keys_odd = 1\n\n   Then total = min(3,1) + min(2,3) = 1 + 2 = 3 -> matches example.\n\n Example 2:\n   \"5 1\", chests [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> Chests_even=5, Chests_odd=0.\n   Keys: [5] -> odd -> Keys_even=0, Keys_odd=1.\n\n   Total = min(5,1) + min(0,0) = 1 + 0 = 1 -> matches.\n\n Example 3:\n   \"1 4\", chest [10] -> even -> Chests_even=1, Chests_odd=0.\n   Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> Keys_even=4, Keys_odd=0.\n   Total = min(1,0) + min(0,4) = 0 + 0 = 0 -> matches.\n\n However, wait: what if we have overlapping? Actually, the two sets are independent. But note: the condition is strict.\n\n But consider: we cannot use the same key twice, so the two matchings are independent. However, the above formula does not account for the fact that the same key might be used in both matchings? No, because the two sets of keys (even and odd) are disjoint.\n\n However, there is no overlap in keys: a key is either even or odd. Similarly for chests.\n\n Therefore, the solution is to count:\n\n   count_even_chest = number of chests with a_i % 2 == 0\n   count_odd_chest = n - count_even_chest\n\n   count_even_key = number of keys with b_j % 2 == 0\n   count_odd_key = m - count_even_key\n\n   answer = min(count_even_chest, count_odd_key) + min(count_odd_chest, count_even_key)\n\n But wait: is it always that we can assign the keys arbitrarily? Yes, because the condition is only about the parity and the assignment of even keys to odd chests and odd keys to even chests. Since we don't care which specific key goes to which chest as long as the parities match, the maximum matching is indeed the minimum of the two counts for each group.\n\n However, note: we are not forced to use all available keys. We are just trying to open as many chests as possible. And since one key can open at most one chest and one chest at most one key, the maximum chests we can open is the sum of the two independent maximum bipartite matchings.\n\n But note: the two sets (even chests and odd keys) and (odd chests and even keys) do not share any keys or chests, so they are independent.\n\n Therefore, the code is straightforward.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This translates to the condition that the parity (even or odd) of the chest's number must be different from the parity of the key's number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests and keys such that each chest is opened by exactly one key, and each key is used at most once. The matching is constrained by the parity condition: an even-numbered chest must be matched with an odd-numbered key, and vice versa.\n2. **Intuition**: By separating the chests and keys into even and odd categories based on their numbers, we can independently compute the maximum possible matches for each category. The solution involves counting how many chests and keys fall into each parity category and then determining the maximum possible matches between them.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Counting the number of even and odd-numbered chests.\n   - Counting the number of even and odd-numbered keys.\n   - The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum of odd chests and even keys.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution processes each chest and key exactly once to count their parities, resulting in a linear time complexity O(n + m), where n is the number of chests and m is the number of keys. This is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n            \n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n            \n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective numbers.\n2. **Counting Parities**: The code counts how many chests and keys have even and odd numbers. This is done by iterating through each chest and key number and checking its parity.\n3. **Calculating Matches**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is calculated by taking the sum of two values:\n   - The minimum of the count of even-numbered chests and odd-numbered keys (since even chests require odd keys).\n   - The minimum of the count of odd-numbered chests and even-numbered keys (since odd chests require even keys).\n4. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the total number of chests that can be opened under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the parity condition to maximize the number of chests opened without any complex computations, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
