Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city.

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem.\n\n We are given two points (home and university) and n lines (roads). The roads divide the plane into blocks. We can move from one block to another if they share a nonzero length border. This means we can only cross a road (i.e., move from one side to the other) by stepping through an intersection? Actually, note: the step is defined as moving from one block to another with a nonzero common border. But note: the common border must be a segment of the road (so crossing at an intersection is just one point, which is not a nonzero length border). However, the problem says \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". \n\n Actually, reading the problem again: the movement is from one block to another when they have a nonzero common border. That means that two blocks are adjacent if they share a portion of a road (a line segment). But note: two blocks that meet only at an intersection (a single point) do not have a nonzero common border. Therefore, to go from one block to another, we must cross a road along a segment (so we are allowed to cross multiple roads in one step? Actually, no: because the common border between two blocks is part of one road. So actually, each edge (border) is a segment of one road. \n\n Now, the key observation: The entire plane is divided by the n lines. Each road is an infinite line. The home and university are in two distinct blocks. We want the minimum number of steps (each step crosses one road, but note: we cannot cross two roads at once because then we would be leaving one block and entering another via two boundaries? Actually, the problem allows moving from one block to another if they share a nonzero border. This implies that we can only cross one road at a time. Because if two roads separate two blocks, then the common border between two blocks is one road. \n\n However, note: the problem does not require that we cross the road at any particular point. The movement is from one block to an adjacent one (sharing a road segment). So each step we cross one road.\n\n But wait: what if two roads intersect and we are at an intersection? Then we might be able to cross multiple roads at once? However, the problem states: \"if the length of their common border is nonzero\" — meaning that the two blocks must share a continuous part of a road (so one road). Therefore, each step crosses exactly one road.\n\n Then the problem reduces to: how many roads (lines) must we cross to get from the home block to the university block?\n\n However, note: it is possible that by crossing one road we might jump from one side to the other, but we might also have to cross the same road twice if the home and university are separated by the same road on opposite sides? Actually, no: because if we cross a road, we flip from one side to the other. And we don't need to cross a road twice because we are going from home to university.\n\n But wait: the catch is that the roads are arbitrary, so we might have to cross a set of roads. However, note that the movement is defined by adjacent blocks. We cannot jump arbitrarily. We have to consider the arrangement of lines.\n\n Alternate approach: think of each road as a linear separator. Assign a sign (or side) to each road for the home and for the university.\n\n For a given road (a, b, c), we can evaluate:\n   home_side = a*x1 + b*y1 + c   (but note: the equation is a*x+b*y+c=0)\n   Similarly for the university.\n\n Since neither home nor university is on the road, we have non-zero values.\n\n However, note: the equation a*x+b*y+c=0 defines two half-planes. We can assign:\n\n   home_side_value = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n   uni_side_value = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n Then, if home_side_value and uni_side_value have the same sign, then the home and university are on the same side of the road -> we don't need to cross this road.\n\n If they have different signs, then we must cross this road.\n\n But wait: is that the case? Actually, yes. Because the road divides the plane, and if the two points are on opposite sides, then we must cross that road to go from home to university.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require crossing a road only once. But observe: each road is crossed exactly once (if we are going from home to university) because we start at home and end at university. And we are looking for the minimum steps.\n\n But here's the catch: the blocks are separated by multiple roads. The minimum steps is the minimum number of roads we must cross? \n\n However, consider: we are allowed to move from one block to an adjacent one by crossing one road. But note: the entire journey from home to university must cross every road that separates the two points. Therefore, the answer is the number of roads for which the home and university lie on opposite sides.\n\n But wait: is that correct? Let me test with the example.\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: \n      1 1\n      -1 -1\n      2\n      0 1 0\n      1 0 0\n\n   These two roads are the vertical line x=0 (second road: 1*x+0*y+0=0 -> x=0) and the horizontal line y=0 (first road: 0*x+1*y+0=0 -> y=0).\n\n   Home (1,1): \n        Road1: 0*1+1*1+0 = 1 -> positive.\n        Road2: 1*1+0*1+0 = 1 -> positive.\n\n   University (-1,-1):\n        Road1: 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 -> negative.\n        Road2: 1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0 = -1 -> negative.\n\n   So both roads separate the two points (because in both cases the signs are opposite). Then according to this, we have to cross 2 roads.\n\n   Output: 2.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input:\n      1 1\n      -1 -1\n      3\n      1 0 0   -> x=0\n      0 1 0   -> y=0\n      1 1 -3  -> x+y-3=0\n\n   Home (1,1) and University (-1,-1)\n\n   Road1: x=0 -> 1 and -1: opposite -> count=1\n   Road2: y=0 -> 1 and -1: opposite -> count=2\n   Road3: x+y-3=0 -> 1+1-3=-1, and -1+-1-3=-5: both negative -> same side.\n\n   Then the answer is 2.\n\n However, note: there is a known similar problem: \"How many roads must a man cross?\" and sometimes the answer is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"minimum number of steps\". And each step crosses one road. However, note that we might cross roads in any order, but the minimal number of crossings is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n However, consider: what if we can cross multiple roads at the same time? No, because the step requires a nonzero common border (so one road). Therefore, each step crosses one road.\n\n But is the minimal number of steps always the number of separating roads?\n\n Let me think: the entire plane is divided by the n lines. The home and university are in two regions. The region is defined by the set of sides (signs) for each road. The university's region has a specific sign pattern for each road. We must change the side for each road that separates them. And since we can cross one road per step, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n However, wait: there is a caveat. Sometimes, two roads might be crossed in one step if the two blocks share a common border that is the intersection of two roads? But note: the common border must be a nonzero length segment. Two different roads (unless they are the same) will only intersect at a single point. So two blocks sharing a border must be separated by exactly one road.\n\n Therefore, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n But wait: what if there are roads that don't separate the two points? They don't matter. Only the ones that separate the two points must be crossed.\n\n However, consider the following: what if two roads are parallel? Then they are two distinct lines. The separation by each is independent.\n\n Therefore, algorithm:\n\n   Read home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2)\n   Read n\n   For i in range(n):\n        Read a, b, c\n\n        Compute for home: val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        Compute for university: val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        If val1 * val2 < 0, then the two points are on opposite sides of this road -> count++\n\n   Then output the count.\n\n Let me test with the examples.\n\n Example 1: \n    n=2\n    Road1: [0,1,0] -> val1 = 0*1+1*1+0 = 1; val2 = 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 -> product negative -> count=1\n    Road2: [1,0,0] -> val1 = 1*1+0*1+0 = 1; val2 = 1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0 = -1 -> product negative -> count=2 -> output 2.\n\n Example 2: \n    n=3\n    Road1: [1,0,0] -> count += 1 (same as above)\n    Road2: [0,1,0] -> count += 1 (same as above) -> now 2\n    Road3: [1,1,-3] -> val1 = 1+1-3 = -1, val2 = -1-1-3 = -5 -> product positive -> skip.\n\n    Output 2.\n\n But wait, the example input was provided as two separate examples. However, note the second example input:\n\n    \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3\"\n\n    And the expected output is 2.\n\n So the program is straightforward.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\" So we don't have to worry about zero.\n\n But wait: what if the road equation is normalized? Actually, we are using the same equation for both points. The sign depends on the normalization. However, note: if we multiply the entire equation by -1, then the signs for both points flip, but the product remains positive (if originally positive, becomes positive again because (-val1)*(-val2)=val1*val2). However, if we have a negative multiplier, the product condition (val1*val2<0) is invariant under flipping the sign of the entire equation? \n\n Let me check: \n   Original: a*x+b*y+c = 0.\n   Flipped: -a*x-b*y-c=0.\n\n   Then for home: original value = v, flipped value = -v.\n   For university: original value = u, flipped value = -u.\n\n   Then the product (v*u) vs ((-v)*(-u)) = v*u -> same.\n\n So the condition is independent of the sign of the equation.\n\n However, we must be cautious with the data type and integer overflow? The numbers can be as large as 10^6, and we are multiplying and adding, but the maximum absolute value for a product:\n\n   a*x1: up to 10^6 * 10^6 = 10^12, then multiplied by 300 and then added? Actually, we are doing two multiplications and then comparing.\n\n   But the problem says: coordinates and coefficients are in [-10^6, 10^6]. So the maximum absolute value for a*x1 is 10^12, then adding the other terms (b*y1, and c) which are also up to 10^6. But note: the equation is a*x+b*y+c, and we are storing the result as an integer.\n\n   However, 10^12 is within the range of Python integers (which are arbitrary precision) but we must be cautious for performance? It should be acceptable.\n\n But wait: what if the product of two large numbers is negative and we are comparing with zero? We don't actually compute the product of the two values (val1 and val2) for the entire set of roads, but we can avoid the multiplication by checking the signs separately.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n\n This avoids the potential overflow if the product is too large? But in Python, integers are arbitrary precision so it's not an issue. However, the numbers can be very large (like 10^12) and the product would be 10^24 which is still manageable in Python (but slower). \n\n But note: the problem says n<=300, so we only do 300 such computations.\n\n However, let me consider the possibility of zero? The problem states that the points are not on the road, so val1 and val2 are non-zero. But what if due to integer rounding or representation we get zero? The problem says the points are not on the road, so we assume that.\n\n But wait: what if the equation has a very large coefficient and the point coordinates are large? The calculation a*x1+b*y1+c might be a huge number, but that's okay.\n\n However, there is a more subtle issue: the equation is defined as a*x+b*y+c=0. But note: the equation might be given in a normalized form? Or not? The problem doesn't say. But the condition for being on the road is that the value is zero, and we are guaranteed that the points are not on the road.\n\n But what if the value is so large that the sign is wrong due to representation? In Python, integers are exact, so we don't have floating point inaccuracies.\n\n However, wait: the problem says the inputs are integers. So we are safe.\n\n Therefore, code:\n\n   x1,y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2,y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a,b,c = map(int, input().split())\n        # Calculate for home\n        val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        # Check if the two points are on opposite sides.\n        if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n However, wait: the problem statement says that the roads are defined by aix + biy + ci = 0. The standard form. But note: the sign of the equation is arbitrary. However, the condition (val1 and val2 having opposite signs) is independent of the sign of the equation (as we saw). \n\n But wait: what if the equation is written as -ai*x -bi*y -ci=0? Then the values for the two points would flip. But our condition (val1 and val2) would still be opposite? \n\n Let me check: \n   Original: a*x+b*y+c=0, then we flip: -a*x-b*y-c=0.\n\n   Then for home: original value = v, then new value = -v.\n   For university: original value = u, then new value = -u.\n\n   Then the condition: \n        (v>0 and u<0) -> (new: -v<0 and -u>0) -> satisfies (new_val1<0 and new_val2>0).\n        (v<0 and u>0) -> (new: -v>0 and -u<0) -> satisfies (new_val1>0 and new_val2<0).\n\n   So the condition holds.\n\n Therefore, the code above is correct.\n\n But wait: what if the road equation has a negative constant? The condition still holds because we are just comparing the signs.\n\n However, there's a catch: the equation might have negative leading coefficients, but the condition is symmetric.\n\n But wait: the problem statement says that the roads are given as aix + biy + ci = 0, and the ai and bi are not both zero.\n\n Therefore, we can use the above.\n\n However, note: the problem statement says that the roads divide the plane. The half-plane assignment is arbitrary by the sign of the equation. But the condition for separation (opposite sides) is correctly captured by the sign change.\n\n But wait: what if the equation is given as a*x+b*y+c=0, and we define the half-planes as { (x,y) | a*x+b*y+c >=0 } and { (x,y) | a*x+b*y+c <0 }? Actually, the problem doesn't specify the half-plane. But note: the separation is defined by the line. The line itself is excluded (since the points are not on the road). The two half-planes are defined by the sign of the expression.\n\n However, the problem doesn't specify which side is which, but the condition for opposite sides is simply that the signs are different.\n\n Therefore, the above code should work.\n\n Let me test with an example from the problem:\n\n Example 1: \n    Home (1,1) and University (-1,-1)\n    Road1: 0*x+1*y+0=0 -> y=0.\n        Home: 1 -> positive, University: -1 -> negative -> opposite.\n\n    Road2: 1*x+0*y+0=0 -> x=0.\n        Home: 1 -> positive, University: -1 -> negative -> opposite.\n\n    Count=2 -> output 2.\n\n Example 2: \n    Home (1,1) and University (-1,-1)\n    Road1: x=0 -> same as above: opposite.\n    Road2: y=0 -> same as above: opposite.\n    Road3: x+y-3=0 -> \n        Home: 1+1-3 = -1 -> negative.\n        University: -1+-1-3 = -5 -> negative -> same.\n\n    Count=2 -> output 2.\n\n But wait, the example input is provided as:\n\n   Example 1: \n        \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0\"\n\n   Example 2: \n        \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3\"\n\n   And the expected outputs are 2 and 2.\n\n However, note: the first example input in the problem is given as:\n\n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n   But wait, the first string in the list is the entire input for the first example? Actually, the problem says:\n\n        Input\n          The first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.\n          The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.\n          The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.\n\n   So the example input is:\n\n        \"1 1\"\n        \"-1 -1\"\n        \"2\"\n        \"0 1 0\"\n        \"1 0 0\"\n\n   But the example output is 2.\n\n   Our code produces 2.\n\n   However, wait: the example input provided in the problem statement is given as a list of two strings, but actually the example input is two separate examples.\n\n   There is a known similar problem: \"Crazy Town\" from CodeForces or other competitions, and the solution is indeed the count of the number of lines that separate the two points.\n\n   But wait, why did the example output in the problem statement show ['2','2']? Actually, the example input was given as two examples, and the output is two numbers.\n\n   Therefore, we output the code accordingly.\n\n   However, wait: is that really the minimal steps? Consider that sometimes you might cross the same road twice? But no, because we are going from home to university and we only need to cross a road once (if we cross it twice, we would be going back and forth, which is not minimal). \n\n   But note: the problem does not require to take the shortest path in the graph of blocks, but the minimal number of steps (each step crosses one road). However, the entire journey must cross all the roads that separate the two points, and we cannot avoid crossing a road that separates them. Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of separating roads.\n\n   However, wait: what if the two points are separated by k roads, but the graph of blocks is such that we can cross two roads at the same time? \n\n   Actually, the step definition: \"move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\" — meaning one road. So we can only cross one road per step.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of separating roads.\n\n   But wait: what if the two points are separated by k roads, but there is a way to cross two of them in two consecutive steps? Yes, that is the minimal. We are counting the total number of roads to cross.\n\n   However, there is a known fact: the minimal number of roads to cross to go from one block to another is the number of roads that separate the two points. \n\n   But wait: what if the roads are not in general position? For example, if two roads are parallel, then the two points might be separated by two parallel roads. Then we must cross both. But the order of crossing doesn't matter.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is the count.\n\n   However, wait: I recall a similar problem where the answer is the number of separating hyperplanes, but sometimes the movement is defined differently (like crossing walls) and the minimal steps is the same.\n\n   But note: the problem says the home and university are in two blocks. The entire plane is divided by the n lines. The two blocks are two regions. The minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the two regions. And that is the number of lines for which the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n   Therefore, we output the count.\n\n   However, let me consider a counterexample:\n\n        Suppose we have three roads forming a triangle (three lines forming a triangle). And the home is inside the triangle and the university is outside.\n\n        How many steps? We must cross the three lines? Actually, no: the home is inside the triangle and the university is outside, then we must cross the three lines? But wait, the three lines form a bounded triangle and unbounded regions. Actually, the minimal steps would be 1 if the university is in an adjacent region (outside the triangle but still adjacent to one side). \n\n        Let me draw:\n\n           Line1: x=0\n           Line2: y=0\n           Line3: x+y=1\n\n        Home: (1,1) -> which is above the line x+y=1? Actually, 1+1=2>=1, so above the line (if we define the line as x+y=1, then the half-plane x+y>1 is one side, and x+y<1 the other).\n\n        Now, if the university is at (2,2): \n            Line1: 2>0 -> positive (if equation is x=0, then 2>0 -> positive) but wait, the equation for Line1: x=0 -> 2>0 so positive, but home is 1>0 -> positive -> same side for Line1.\n            Line2: 2>0 -> positive, home: 1>0 -> positive -> same.\n            Line3: 2+2=4>1 -> positive, home: 1+1=2>1 -> positive -> same.\n\n        Then according to our method, no separating road -> 0 steps? But (1,1) is inside the triangle (the triangle formed by x=0, y=0, and x+y=1) is the set where x>=0, y>=0, and x+y<=1. (1,1) is not inside. Actually, (1,1) is in the region x+y>=1, and the triangle is the set of points (x,y) such that x>=0, y>=0, and x+y<=1. So (1,1) is not inside the triangle. \n\n        Let me choose:\n\n            Home: (0.5,0.5) -> inside the triangle? (0.5>=0, 0.5>=0, 0.5+0.5=1<=1 -> on the line? Actually, the line equation is x+y=1. So (0.5,0.5) is not on the line. But wait, the equation is x+y=1. The line is the boundary. The half-planes are defined by x+y<1 and x+y>1.\n\n            For home (0.5,0.5): \n                Line1: 0.5>0 -> positive\n                Line2: 0.5>0 -> positive\n                Line3: 0.5+0.5=1 -> but wait, the problem says the points are not on the road. So let me choose (0.4,0.4): \n                    Line3: 0.4+0.4=0.8 <1 -> negative.\n\n            Now, university: (2,2): \n                Line1: 2>0 -> positive\n                Line2: 2>0 -> positive\n                Line3: 4>1 -> positive.\n\n            Then the separating roads are only Line3? Because for Line3: home is negative, university positive -> opposite.\n\n            So the answer would be 1.\n\n            But actually, to get from (0.4,0.4) to (2,2) we must cross the line x+y=1. And we can only cross one road at a time. So one step.\n\n        Another example: \n            Home: (0.4,0.4) and University: (0.4,0.6) -> wait, (0.4,0.6): \n                Line1: 0.4>0 -> positive\n                Line2: 0.6>0 -> positive\n                Line3: 0.4+0.6=1 -> on the road? So not allowed.\n\n            Let me choose University: (0.4,0.7) -> \n                Line3: 0.4+0.7=1.1 -> positive.\n\n            Then separating roads: Line3.\n\n        Now, what if the university is in a different direction? For example, university: (-1,-1) (from the first example) for the same three roads (x=0, y=0, x+y=1). \n\n            Home (0.4,0.4) and University (-1,-1):\n\n            Line1: 0.4>0 (positive) and -1<0 (negative) -> opposite.\n            Line2: 0.4>0 (positive) and -1<0 (negative) -> opposite.\n            Line3: 0.4+0.4=0.8 (negative) and -1+-1=-2 (negative) -> same.\n\n            Then the answer is 2.\n\n            How to get from (0.4,0.4) to (-1,-1)? We must cross x=0 and y=0. But note: the two points are separated by x=0 and y=0. We cannot cross two roads at once (because the common border between two blocks is one road). Therefore, we must cross two roads.\n\n            Steps: \n                Step1: cross either x=0 or y=0. Let's say we cross x=0. Then we are in the left half-plane (x<0). Then from there, we need to cross y=0 to get to y<0. So two steps.\n\n            This matches.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not guarantee that the home and university are in the same connected component? Actually, the problem says: \"Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block.\" And the roads divide the plane. Since the points are not on the road, they are in some block. And the graph of blocks is connected? Actually, no: the arrangement of lines might disconnect the plane into multiple blocks. However, if the two points are in the same block, then we don't need to cross any road. But the problem says: \"determine the minimum number of steps\". \n\n   What if the two points are in the same block? Then the answer is 0.\n\n   But wait, what if the two points are in the same block? Then for every road, the two points are on the same side. Then our code returns 0.\n\n   Example: \n        Home: (1,1), University: (2,2) and one road: x+y=3.\n\n        For home: 1+1=2 <3 -> negative.\n        For university: 2+2=4 >3 -> positive.\n\n        Then they are on opposite sides -> count=1.\n\n        But wait, if the two points are (1,1) and (2,2) and the road is x+y=3, then they are on opposite sides? Actually, (1,1) is below the line and (2,2) is above the line. Then they are separated by the road. \n\n        Now, what if the two points are (1,1) and (2,2) and two roads: \n            Road1: x+y=3\n            Road2: x+y=4\n\n        Then for Road1: (1,1) is below and (2,2) is above -> opposite.\n        For Road2: (1,1) is below (1+1=2<4) and (2,2) is below (4<4? no, 4==4 -> but wait, the problem says the points are not on the road. So we cannot have (2,2) on Road2. Let me change Road2 to x+y=5.\n\n        Then Road2: (1,1): 2<5 -> negative; (2,2):4<5 -> negative -> same.\n\n        Then the answer is 1.\n\n        But wait, the two points are separated by Road1 only.\n\n        Now, what if the two points are (1,1) and (2,2) and two roads: \n            Road1: x+y=3\n            Road2: x+y=2\n\n        Then Road1: (1,1):2<3 -> negative; (2,2):4>3 -> positive -> opposite.\n        Road2: (1,1):2=2 -> but wait, the problem says the points are not on the road. So we cannot have (1,1) on Road2. So Road2 must be defined such that (1,1) is not on it. Let me set Road2: x+y=1.\n\n        Then Road2: (1,1): 2>1 -> positive; (2,2):4>1 -> positive -> same.\n\n        Then answer=1.\n\n        But note: the two points are separated by Road1. However, they are not separated by Road2.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   Conclusion: the minimal number of steps is the number of roads for which the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n   Code:\n\n        x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n        x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n        n = int(input())\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n            # Evaluate the expression for home and university\n            val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n            val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n            # Check if they are on opposite sides\n            if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n   However, wait: what if the equation is defined with negative signs? For example, if we have a road defined as -x-y+3=0, then for home (1,1): -1-1+3=1>0, and for university (-1,-1): -(-1)-(-1)+3=1+1+3=5>0 -> same side. But the line is the same as x+y-3=0. \n\n   But note: the condition is that the two points are on opposite sides. The expression for the line x+y-3=0 is the same as -x-y+3=0 multiplied by -1. However, the signs of the expressions for the two points are flipped, but the condition (opposite sides) is still captured by the product being negative (or by the sign comparison). \n\n   Let me check with home (1,1) and university (-1,-1) for the equation -x-y+3=0.\n\n        For home (1,1): -1-1+3=1 -> positive.\n        For university (-1,-1): -(-1)-(-1)+3=1+1+3=5 -> positive.\n\n        Then condition: (1>0 and 5>0) -> same side.\n\n        Now, for the same home and university and the equation x+y-3=0 (the original):\n\n        Home (1,1): 1+1-3=-1 -> negative.\n        University (-1,-1): -1-1-3=-5 -> negative.\n\n        Same side.\n\n        But wait, in the first example (with two roads) we had:\n\n            Example: \n                1 1\n                -1 -1\n                2\n                0 1 0\n                1 0 0\n\n            Now, if we reverse one of the equations, say the first road becomes 0*x -1*y +0=0 -> -y=0, which is the same as y=0. Then for home (1,1): -1<0 -> negative. For university (-1,-1): -(-1)=1>0 -> positive. So they are opposite.\n\n        The condition (val1<0 and val2>0) or (val1>0 and val2<0) still holds.\n\n        Therefore, the code is robust to the sign of the equation.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n        x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n        n = int(input())\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            data = input().split()\n            if not data:\n                continue\n            a, b, c = map(int, data)\n            val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n            val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n            # If the two points are on opposite sides, then the signs of val1 and val2 must differ.\n            if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n However, wait: the problem statement says that the roads are given as aix + biy + ci = 0. The equation is defined with the same sign convention. But our calculation uses the given equation. The condition for opposite sides is that the expression changes sign. \n\n But note: the expression a*x+b*y+c is the same regardless of the sign of the equation. However, if we flip the equation, the expression flips. But the condition (val1 and val2 having opposite signs) is independent of the equation's sign.\n\n   Example: \n        Equation1: a*x+b*y+c=0 -> expression E1 = a*x+b*y+c.\n        Equation2: -a*x-b*y-c=0 -> expression E2 = -a*x-b*y-c = -E1.\n\n        Then for two points: \n            Original: (E11 and E12) \n            New: (-E11 and -E12)\n\n        Then (E11 <0 and E12>0) becomes (-E11>0 and -E12<0) -> (positive and negative) -> opposite.\n\n        Similarly, (E11",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing one road (line) that separates two adjacent blocks. The key observation here is that each road (line) divides the plane into two half-planes. If the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, then crossing that road is necessary to reach the destination. The minimal number of steps is simply the count of such roads that separate the two points.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining how many roads (infinite lines) separate the home and university blocks. Each road is defined by the equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\). For each road, we check if the home and university lie on opposite sides of the line. If they do, crossing this road is mandatory.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution hinges on evaluating the side of each road for both the home and university. If the evaluations (signs of the expressions \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\)) for the two points differ, the road must be crossed.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, compute the value of the line equation at both points. If the signs of these values differ, increment the step count. The total count after processing all roads gives the answer.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each road exactly once, performing constant-time operations per road. With \\(n\\) roads (up to 300), the complexity is \\(O(n)\\), which is efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    x1 = int(data[idx]); y1 = int(data[idx+1]); idx += 2\n    x2 = int(data[idx]); y2 = int(data[idx+1]); idx += 2\n    n = int(data[idx]); idx += 1\n    \n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[idx]); b = int(data[idx+1]); c = int(data[idx+2]); idx += 3\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first two values are the coordinates of the home, followed by the university's coordinates. The next value is the number of roads, and subsequent lines provide the coefficients for each road's equation.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the code evaluates the line equation at both the home and university coordinates. If the results have opposite signs, it means the two points lie on opposite sides of the road, and thus, the road must be crossed.\n3. **Counting Steps**: The total number of such roads gives the minimal steps required, as each step involves crossing one road.\n4. **Output**: The final count is printed, representing the answer.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road once, leveraging simple arithmetic and comparison operations to determine the solution. The algorithm is optimal with linear time complexity relative to the number of roads.",
