Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with two integers: a and b.\n We start with `a` new candles. Each candle burns for 1 hour and then becomes a leftover (which can be combined to make new candles).\n We can combine `b` leftovers to make one new candle.\n\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have `a` new candles and 0 leftovers.\n   - Each hour, we can use one new candle (or a candle made from leftovers) to light up the room for that hour.\n   - After burning, each candle becomes one leftover.\n\n However, we can reuse leftovers: every time we have at least `b` leftovers, we can convert them into floor(leftovers / b) new candles, and the remainder leftovers remain.\n\n Steps:\n   Let `hours = 0`\n   Let `leftover = 0`\n   We start with `candles = a`\n\n   But note: we can simulate until we don't have enough to burn for an hour.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   while candles + leftover >= 1:\n        We burn as many candles as possible? Actually, we burn one candle per hour, but we can burn multiple in one go only if we have multiple.\n\n   However, the problem says: when we light a new candle, it burns for an hour. So we can think:\n\n   Step 1: We use all available new candles (current candles) to burn for an hour. Then they become leftovers.\n   Then we use the leftovers to make more candles.\n\n   But note: we might not have to burn all at once? Actually, we can use the newly made candles in the same cycle?\n\n   Example: ['4 2'] -> 7 hours.\n\n   How?\n     Start: 4 candles -> burn 4 candles, that gives 4 hours and 4 leftovers.\n     Then, from 4 leftovers, we can make 2 new candles (since 4 // 2 = 2, and 4 % 2 = 0). Now we have 2 candles and 0 leftovers.\n     Then, burn 2 candles -> 2 hours and 2 leftovers.\n     Then, from 2 leftovers, we can make 1 candle (floor(2/2)=1). Then we have 1 candle and 0 leftovers (because 2//2=1 and 2%2=0).\n     Then, burn 1 candle -> 1 hour and 1 leftover.\n     Now we have 1 leftover and 0 new candles. Since we don't have enough to make a new candle (we need b=2 for a new one, but we have 1) and no new candles, we stop.\n\n     Total hours: 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8? Wait, but the example says 7.\n\n   Let me recount the example:\n\n     Hour 1: burn one candle -> leftover becomes 1, candles become 3 (if we burn one, then we have 3 left initially? Actually, we start with 4.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think of burning one candle at a time, but the problem does not specify that we have to burn one candle per hour. Actually, we can burn multiple candles in separate hours.\n\n   However, note: we have 4 candles initially. We can burn all 4 in 4 consecutive hours. Then we get 4 leftovers, which make 2 new candles (and we have 0 leftovers). Then we burn these 2 in 2 consecutive hours. Then we get 2 leftovers, which make 1 new candle. Then we burn that 1 in 1 hour. Then we have 1 leftover (from the last burn) and we cannot make a new candle (because 1 < 2). So total hours = 4+2+1 = 7.\n\n   So we must account for the fact that we can burn one candle per hour, but we can use multiple candles (each burned in a separate hour) and then use the leftovers to make more candles.\n\n   Algorithm:\n\n   Let `total_hours = 0`\n   Let `current_candles = a`\n   Let `leftover = 0`\n\n   While current_candles > 0 or leftover >= b:   # But wait, what if we have leftover < b and current_candles==0? Then we break.\n\n   Actually, we can break when we don't have any candle (current_candles==0 and leftover < b).\n\n   However, we can also simulate by:\n\n   Step 1: Burn as many candles as we have (current_candles) in that many hours.\n   Then, we add current_candles to leftover, and then recalc how many new candles we can make.\n\n   But note: after burning, we have `current_candles` burned, so we get `current_candles` leftovers. Then we set current_candles to 0, and then we take `leftover`",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The key observation here is that each candle burns for one hour and then becomes a leftover. These leftovers can be combined to create new candles, following the rule that every `b` leftovers can be transformed into one new candle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with `a` new candles and zero leftovers.\n2. **Burning Candles**: For each hour, burn as many candles as available (either new or leftover-derived). Each burned candle contributes one hour and one leftover.\n3. **Recycling Leftovers**: After burning, if the number of leftovers is sufficient (`leftover >= b`), convert them into new candles. The number of new candles is the integer division of leftovers by `b`, and the remaining leftovers are the remainder.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The process continues until there are not enough candles (new or leftover) to burn for another hour. Specifically, when both current candles and leftovers are insufficient to form even one new candle, the process stops.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    total_hours = 0\n    current_candles = a\n    leftover = 0\n    \n    while current_candles > 0 or leftover >= b:\n        if current_candles > 0:\n            burn_count = current_candles\n            current_candles = 0\n            total_hours += burn_count\n            leftover += burn_count\n        else:\n            if leftover >= b:\n                new_candles = leftover // b\n                leftover = leftover % b\n                current_candles = new_candles\n                total_hours += current_candles\n                leftover += current_candles\n                \n    print(total_hours)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The program reads two integers, `a` (initial candles) and `b` (number of leftovers needed to make a new candle).\n2. **Loop**: The loop runs as long as there are either new candles or enough leftovers to make at least one new candle.\n3. **Burning Phase**: If there are new candles, all of them are burned (each contributing one hour), and their leftovers are added to the total leftovers.\n4. **Recycling Phase**: If leftovers are sufficient (`leftover >= b`), they are converted into new candles. The number of new candles is `leftover // b`, and the remaining leftovers are `leftover % b`. These new candles are then added to the pool of current candles.\n5. **Termination**: The loop exits when neither new candles nor enough leftovers are left to form even one new candle. The total hours accumulated during the burning phases is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning and recycling candles, ensuring optimal usage to maximize the total illumination time.",
