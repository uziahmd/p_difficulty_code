Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a straightforward approach.\n Since the string is short, we can try to consider every substring and check for duplicates.\n However, note: We need the longest substring that appears at least twice (and they can overlap).\n\n Steps:\n 1. If the string length is less than 2, then no duplicate substring of length>=1? Actually, if the string is of length 1, then we cannot have two same substrings (unless we allow overlapping, but even with overlapping, two same single letters require at least two consecutive same letters). But note: the problem says \"at least twice\", meaning two occurrences. For a single letter, we need two non-overlapping or one overlapping? The example: \"zzz\" -> output 2. So in \"zzz\", the substring \"zz\" appears at positions 0-1 and 1-2.\n\n 2. Approach:\n    We can iterate over all possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (which is floor(n/2) because two substrings of length L must fit in the string, but actually they can overlap, so we can have two starting from different positions and the total length is n, but the condition is that the two occurrences must be distinct. However, the problem allows overlapping.\n\n    But note: the two occurrences must be distinct. Even if they overlap, they are considered two separate occurrences.\n\n    Example: \"ababa\": \n        substring \"aba\" appears at index0 and index2 -> so length 3 is valid.\n\n    How about: \n        We can generate all substrings and store their occurrences (start indices) in a dictionary. Then for each substring, if it appears at least twice, we record its length.\n\n    However, the problem asks for the longest substring that appears at least twice.\n\n    But note: the substring \"a\" appears many times, but we are interested in the longest.\n\n    Steps:\n        Let s be the input string.\n        Let n = len(s)\n        We'll create a dictionary: mapping substring -> list of starting indices (or just count, but we need the substring itself)\n\n        Alternatively, we can iterate from the longest possible substring down to 1 and check if there's any substring of that length that appears at least twice.\n\n        However, the maximum length of a substring that can appear twice is at most floor((n+1)/2)? Not exactly. In fact, the two occurrences can overlap arbitrarily. The maximum length of a substring that appears twice is limited by the entire string, but note: if we take a substring of length L, then we need two starting indices i and j such that i < j and the substring s[i:i+L] equals s[j:j+L]. The condition for overlapping is that j can be as small as i+1 (so that the two substrings overlap by L-1 characters).\n\n        But note: the problem does not require the two occurrences to be non-overlapping.\n\n        Since n is at most 100, we can do:\n\n        Option 1: Generate all substrings and record their frequency (by content and length). Then we look for the maximum length L such that there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n        How to generate all substrings? There are O(n^2) substrings, which for n=100 is about 5000, which is acceptable.\n\n        Steps for Option 1:\n            Create a dictionary: key = substring, value = set of starting indices (or just count, but we don't really need the indices, only the count of distinct occurrences? Actually, we can just count the number of times the substring appears. But note: the same substring appearing at the same starting index multiple times? No, because we are generating by starting index.\n\n            However, we don't care about the exact indices, we care about the substring content and how many times it appears.\n\n            But wait: two occurrences are defined by two different starting indices? Yes, because even if the substring is the same and we consider overlapping, we count each contiguous segment.\n\n            Example: \"aaa\" -> \n                substrings of length 1: \"a\" appears at indices 0,1,2 -> so count=3 -> valid.\n                substrings of length 2: \"aa\" appears at indices 0,1 -> count=2 -> valid.\n                substrings of length 3: \"aaa\" appears once -> invalid.\n\n            So the answer for \"aaa\" would be 2.\n\n            But note: the problem says \"longest substring\", so we want the maximum L.\n\n            However, we can break early: we want the maximum L for which there is a substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n            But note: it is possible that a longer substring appears twice, so we should consider from long to short.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n           ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which means that even if substrings share some characters, they are still considered distinct occurrences. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires checking all possible substrings of the input string to determine the longest one that appears at least twice. Given the constraints (string length ≤ 100), a brute-force approach is feasible.\n2. **Intuition**: For each possible substring length, starting from the largest possible down to 1, we check if there exists any substring of that length that appears at least twice. The first such length found will be the answer since we are checking from largest to smallest.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Iterate over all possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (which is the length of the string) down to 1.\n   - For each length, generate all unique substrings of that length and use a set to track occurrences. If a substring repeats, note its length.\n   - The first length where a repeating substring is found is the answer.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks O(n²) substrings in the worst case (for each starting position, it checks all possible lengths). However, given the small input size (n ≤ 100), this approach is efficient enough.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    if n <= 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Check from the longest possible substring length down to 1\n    for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        for start in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[start:start+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                seen[substr] += 1\n            else:\n                seen[substr] = 1\n        # Check if any substring of length L appeared at least twice\n        for count in seen.values():\n            if count >= 2:\n                print(L)\n                return\n    print(0)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the string length is 1 or less, the output is 0 since no substring of length ≥ 2 can exist.\n3. **Iterate Over Substring Lengths**: The loop starts from the largest possible substring length (the entire string) down to 1.\n4. **Track Substring Occurrences**: For each length, a dictionary is used to count occurrences of each unique substring. If any substring count reaches 2, the current length is printed as the result.\n5. **Output Result**: The first valid length found (from largest to smallest) is printed, ensuring the solution is optimal. If no such substring is found, the default output is 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible substrings in descending order of length, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal for the given constraints.",
