Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem in two parts:\n 1. First, we can handle the '?'s separately because they can match any color.\n    However, note: a '?' in one string might be matched with a specific letter or a '?' in the other.\n\n But note: the problem requires maximum pairs. The idea is to match as many as possible.\n\n Observation:\n   - We have two strings: left (l) and right (r), each of length n.\n\n Steps:\n\n  Since we are allowed to use each boot at most once, we need to form up to n pairs.\n\n  We can break down the matching into two types:\n    a) Matching between two specific letters (non '?') that are the same.\n    b) Matching between a '?' and a non '?' (in either direction) or two '?'s.\n\n  However, note that an indefinite color ('?') is compatible with any. So we can use '?' to \"fill\" when there is no direct match.\n\n  But note: we must maximize the number of pairs. The total pairs we can form is limited by the total boots (n).\n\n  Approach:\n\n  We can consider:\n\n  1. First, count the number of '?' in l and r. Let's say we have `ql` and `qr` respectively.\n\n  2. Then, we can first try to form pairs between non '?' boots that are compatible. Then, use the '?' to cover the remaining boots.\n\n  However, the problem is that we don't know which '?' to use for which. Also, sometimes it might be beneficial to use a '?' for a non '?' because if we have extra non '?' that don't match, then we can use '?' to cover them.\n\n  Alternate approach:\n\n  We can use a greedy matching:\n\n  Step 1: Count the frequency of each letter in the left and right strings (ignoring '?').\n\n  But note: the positions matter because we cannot pair the same boot twice.\n\n  Actually, we need to assign specific boots. We are allowed to output any matching that gives the maximum pairs.\n\n  Proposed algorithm:\n\n  We can use a two-step process:\n\n  Step 1: Form pairs between non '?' characters that are the same. We can do this by scanning both strings and matching same non '?' when found, but we must not use the same index twice.\n\n  However, we have two strings: left and right. We are going to form pairs from left[i] and right[j]. But note: we cannot change the order arbitrarily? Actually, the problem does not require to keep the order, but we are given two arrays of fixed length.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"Print the pairs\" and the indices are the given positions (from 1 to n). So we must output the original indices.\n\n  We can do:\n\n  Let's create two lists for left and right, each containing tuples (color, index) for the non '?' and also for the '?'.\n\n  However, we want to maximize the number of pairs. The maximum pairs we can form is at most n.\n\n  We can consider:\n\n  - First, match non '?' with non '?'.\n      For each color, let L[color] be the list of indices in l that are non '?' and have that color.\n      Similarly, R[color] for r.\n\n  Then, for each color, we can match min(|L[color]|, |R[color]|) pairs.\n\n  But wait: what if we have a '?' in one and a non '?' in the other? Then we can use the '?' to match the non '?'.\n\n  However, the above frequency method only matches non '?' with non '?'.\n\n  Then, the remaining boots (both non '?' that were not matched and the '?') can be matched arbitrarily.\n\n  But note: a '?' in left can be matched with a '?' in right, or with a non '?' in right (if the non '?' is not matched already). Similarly for the '?' in right.\n\n  How to count the total pairs?\n\n  Let:\n    total_non_q = n - ql - qr   [Actually, we have to account for the fact that we have two separate counts]\n\n  Actually, let me define:\n\n    Let X = set of indices for left that are non '?'\n    Let Y = set of indices for right that are non '?'\n\n  We can form a bipartite graph between the entire left and entire right, with edges defined by compatibility.\n\n  However, n can be up to 150000, so we cannot build an explicit graph.\n\n  We can use a greedy matching for non '?' first, and then use the '?' as wildcards.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  1. Count the non '?' matches without using any '?'. We can do:\n\n      Create a dictionary for left non '?' and right non '?'.\n\n      For each color, the number of non '?' pairs we can form is min(count_left[color], count_right[color]).\n\n      But note: we are going to use the exact same color. However, we must assign specific indices.\n\n  2. Then, the remaining non '?' boots (that are not matched) and all the '?' boots can be matched arbitrarily.\n\n  However, the catch is: we can also use a non '?' in left with a '?' in right, and vice versa, even if we didn't use the '?' for the non '?'? Actually, we are trying to maximize the total pairs.\n\n  But note: the problem is to compute the maximum number of compatible pairs.\n\n  We can think:\n\n    Let A = set of left boots (each has a color, and we know if it's '?')\n    Let B = set of right boots.\n\n    We can form a pair if:\n        (l[i] == r[j]) or (l[i]=='?' or r[j]=='?')\n\n    But note: if both are '?', then they are compatible.\n\n  We can break the problem into:\n\n    Step 1: Count the maximum pairs we can form.\n\n    The maximum pairs is at least the sum over colors of min(count_left[color], count_right[color]) for non '?'.\n\n    Then, after removing those, we have:\n\n        leftover_left = all the non '?' that were not matched, plus the left '?'.\n        leftover_right = all the non '?' that were not matched, plus the right '?'.\n\n    Now, in the leftover, we can form a complete bipartite graph because every left boot is compatible with every right boot (since the left ones are either '?' or non '?' that weren't matched, but wait: if a non '?' is leftover, then it wasn't matched because there was no corresponding non '?' in the right. However, note: the non '?' in left might be matched with a '?' in right, and similarly for the other way.\n\n    Actually, we can use the '?' to fill any gap. In fact, the entire leftover set can be matched arbitrarily.\n\n    So the total pairs would be:\n\n        base = sum_{color} min(count_left[color], count_right[color])\n        Then, we have (n - 2 * base) non '?' that are unmatched? Actually, no: the base uses some non '?' and leaves the rest.\n\n        Actually, the total non '?' in left is (n - ql) and in right is (n - qr). The base uses for each color c: min(L[c], R[c]) pairs, so the unmatched non '?' in left is (n - ql) - base, and similarly for right.\n\n        Then, the total leftover boots (both left and right) are:\n\n            leftover_left = (n - ql) - base + ql = n - base   [because we started with n left boots: (n-ql) non '?' and ql '?'; and the non '?' part used (base) pairs, so the unmatched left boots (which are non '?' that weren't matched) is (n-ql) - base, and then we add the ql '?' -> total unmatched left: (n-ql-base) + ql = n - base]\n            Similarly, leftover_right = n - base.\n\n        But wait, that implies we can form base + min(leftover_left, leftover_right) pairs? Actually, no: because the leftover_left and leftover_right are both n-base, so we can form base + (n-base) = n? That doesn't sound right because base is the pairs from non '?' and then the rest are matched arbitrarily.\n\n        Actually, the base pairs are formed from non '?' and then we have two sets of unmatched: \n            unmatched_left_non = (n-ql) - base   [the non '?' left that aren't matched]\n            unmatched_right_non = (n-qr) - base   [the non '?' right that aren't matched]\n            and then we have ql_left = ql (the '?' in left) and qr_right = qr (the '?' in right)\n\n        Now, the total unmatched boots (both left and right) is: \n            unmatched_left = (n-ql) - base + ql = n - base   [because we subtract the base from the non '?' part and then add the '?']\n            unmatched_right = n - base\n\n        But note: the base pairs are formed by non '?' and do not use any '?'.\n\n        Then, the remaining n-base left boots and n-base right boots can be matched arbitrarily because:\n\n            - Any '?' in left can match any right (even non '?') and vice versa.\n\n        So we can form exactly min(n-base, n-base) = n-base pairs? \n\n        Then the total pairs would be base + (n - base) = n.\n\n        But wait, that means we can form n pairs? However, base is the pairs from non '?' and then we use the rest arbitrarily. But the base pairs are already n? No, base is at most n.\n\n        Actually, base <= n, and then n-base is the remaining. But note: we cannot form more than n pairs.\n\n        However, is it always possible to form n-base pairs in the leftover? \n\n          In the leftover, we have two sets of size (n-base) each. And since every boot in the leftover is either '?' or a non '?' that wasn't matched (and therefore, there's no non '?' in the leftover that has a matching non '?' in the opposite side, because we already took the maximum for each color). \n\n        But wait: what if we have a non '?' in the leftover? Then, since we did not match it in the base step (because there was no corresponding non '?' in the opposite side), then we can match it with a '?' on the opposite side. And the '?' can be used arbitrarily.\n\n        So yes, we can form a complete bipartite graph in the leftover. Therefore, the total pairs is n.\n\n        However, that is not true: consider if we have:\n\n            l = \"a?\" and r = \"?b\"\n\n            Then base pairs for 'a' and 'b'? Actually, no: because the base step only considers non '?' with the same non '?'. Here, base=0.\n\n            Then we form two pairs? But wait, we have two left and two right. We can form two pairs:\n\n                (a with ?) and (?, b) OR (a with b) and (?, ?) but note: a and b are different -> not compatible.\n\n            Actually, we can form two pairs: \n                Option 1: (a, ?) and (?, b) -> two pairs.\n                Option 2: (a, b) is not allowed, so we must use the '?' to cover the other.\n\n            So the maximum pairs is 2.\n\n        Therefore, the total pairs is n.\n\n        Why? Because we have n left and n right, and the condition is compatible. But note: the condition is that we can match any way we like as long as the colors are compatible. And the entire set of boots forms a graph that is not necessarily complete, but the problem allows us to use the '?' as universal. \n\n        Actually, we can form n pairs if we have n left and n right? Not necessarily. Consider:\n\n            l = \"a\", r = \"b\"\n\n            Then base = 0, and then we have two leftovers: one left and one right. But they are not compatible. So we form 0 pairs.\n\n        Therefore, the above reasoning is flawed.\n\n  Let me reexamine:\n\n    We have two sets: left and right.\n\n    We can form a pair (i, j) if:\n        (l[i] == r[j]) or (l[i]=='?' and r[j]!='?') or (l[i]!='?' and r[j]=='?') or (l[i]=='?' and r[j]=='?')\n\n    But note: the condition is symmetric for '?'.\n\n    We want to maximize the number of pairs.\n\n    This is a bipartite matching problem. However, n can be up to 150000, so we need an efficient algorithm.\n\n  Alternate Insight:\n\n    We can split the boots:\n\n        Let L0 = all left boots that are not '?'\n        Let L1 = all left boots that are '?'\n        Let R0 = all right boots that are not '?'\n        Let R1 = all right boots that are '?'\n\n    Then, the pairs can be:\n\n        Type 1: L0 with R0 (same color)\n        Type 2: L0 with R1\n        Type 3: L1 with R0\n        Type 4: L1 with R1\n\n    We want to maximize the total pairs.\n\n    We know that we can form at most min(|L0|+|L1|, |R0|+|R1|) = n pairs, but the constraints of colors in Type1 and Type2/Type3 may restrict.\n\n    However, note that Type2 and Type3 are free (any L0 can match any R1 and any R0 can match any L1). But Type1 is restricted to same color.\n\n    How to maximize?\n\n        Step 1: Use as many Type1 pairs as possible (without using any '?' and without exceeding the available non '?' in each color).\n\n        Step 2: Then, use the remaining non '?' (from L0 and R0) with the '?' (from the opposite side). But note: we can use a '?' from the left to match a non '?' from the right, and vice versa.\n\n        However, we have two kinds of '?' sides: left and right.\n\n        After Step 1, we have:\n\n            Let x = base (Type1 pairs)\n\n            Then, the remaining non '?' in left is (|L0| - x_used_in_L0) but wait, actually the Type1 pairs use some from L0 and R0. \n\n        Alternatively, we can model:\n\n            Let F = base (from Type1) = sum_{c in alphabet} min(count_L0(c), count_R0(c))\n\n            Then, the remaining non '?' in left: |L0| - (number of Type1 from L0) = |L0| - (sum_{c} min(count_L0(c), count_R0(c))) [but wait, how much of L0 is used? Actually, for each color c, we use min(L0(c), R0(c)) from L0. So the remaining in L0 is |L0| - (sum_{c} min(L0(c), R0(c)))? Actually, the sum over c of min(L0(c), R0(c)) is the total Type1 pairs, and each Type1 pair uses one from L0 and one from R0.\n\n            Similarly, the remaining in R0 is |R0| - base.\n\n        Then, we have:\n\n            Type2: We can use the remaining L0 (non '?') with the R1 (right '?') and also the Type3: the remaining R0 (non '?') with the L1 (left '?').\n\n            But note: we cannot use the same '?' multiple times.\n\n        Now, the maximum additional pairs we can form is:\n\n            Let a = remaining_L0 = |L0| - base\n            Let b = remaining_R0 = |R0| - base\n            Let c = |L1|\n            Let d = |R1|\n\n        Then, we can form:\n\n            Type2: min(a, d)   [remaining non '?' in left (L0) with right '?']\n            Type3: min(b, c)   [remaining non '?' in right (R0) with left '?']\n\n        And Type4: min(c - Type3_used, d - Type2_used) but wait, we used some '?' for Type2 and Type3.\n\n        Actually, the total pairs from Type2 and Type3 is min(a, d) + min(b, c). Then, the remaining '?' on the left is c - min(b, c) and on the right is d - min(a, d). Then, we can form min(remaining_L1, remaining_R1) for Type4.\n\n        Therefore, the total pairs is:\n\n            base + min(a, d) + min(b, c) + min(c - min(b, c), d - min(a, d))\n\n        But note: a = |L0| - base, and b = |R0| - base.\n\n        Then, total = base + min(|L0|-base, |R1|) + min(|R0|-base, |L1|) + min(|L1| - min(|R0|-base, |L1|), |R1| - min(|L0|-base, |R1|))\n\n        However, let me check with an example:\n\n            Example: l = \"a?\" and r = \"?b\"\n\n            base = 0 (since no common non '?' in L0 and R0)\n\n            a = |L0| = 1 (the 'a')\n            b = |R0| = 1 (the 'b')\n            c = |L1| = 1\n            d = |R1| = 1\n\n            Then:\n                Type2: min(1, 1) = 1\n                Type3: min(1, 1) = 1\n                Then Type4: min(1-1, 1-1)=0\n\n            Total = 0+1+1+0 = 2.\n\n            But wait, we cannot form two pairs because we have two left and two right? Actually, we can form two pairs: (a,?) and (?,b). But note: the two boots are distinct. However, we have two pairs: \n                left boot0 (a) with right boot0 (?) -> pair (0+1, 0+1) [if we index from 1: (1,1)]\n                left boot1 (?) with right boot1 (b) -> pair (2,2)\n\n            But wait, the input has two boots. The example input was:\n\n                Input: \n                  2\n                  ab\n                  cd\n\n            Actually, the example I gave was:\n\n                Input: \n                  2\n                  a?\n                  ?b\n\n            The output should be:\n\n                2\n                1 1\n                2 2\n\n            But wait, the problem says the indices: the i-th left boot and j-th right boot.\n\n            However, note: the problem says the first line is n, then two strings of length n.\n\n            So the example input is:\n\n                2\n                a?\n                ?b\n\n            Then the left boots: \n                left[0] = 'a', left[1] = '?'\n            Right boots:\n                right[0] = '?', right[1] = 'b'\n\n            Then, we can form two pairs: (0-indexed) (0,0) and (1,1). \n\n            But the problem expects indices from 1 to n. So we output:\n\n                2\n                1 1\n                2 2\n\n            However, note: the example input in the problem statement has:\n\n                Input: \n                    10\n                    codeforces\n                    dodivthree\n\n                Output: \n                    5\n                    7 8\n                    4 9\n                    2 2\n                    9 10\n                    3 1\n\n            This indicates that the indices are 1-indexed.\n\n        Therefore, the total pairs is base + min(a,d) + min(b,c) + min(c - min(b,c), d - min(a,d))\n\n        But wait, is that formula correct?\n\n        Let me test with the example from the problem:\n\n            Example 1: \n                Input: \n                    10\n                    codeforces\n                    dodivthree\n\n            We are told the output is 5.\n\n            How many non '?' in l and r? \n                l: 'codeforces' -> no '?' -> |L0|=10, |L1|=0\n                r: 'dodivthree' -> no '?' -> |R0|=10, |R1|=0\n\n            Then base = sum_{c} min(count_left(c), count_right(c))\n\n            Let's count:\n\n                l: c:1, o:1, d:1, e:1, f:1, r:1, s:1 (wait, \"codeforces\": \n                    c:1, o:1, d:1, e:1, e:1? Actually, \"codeforces\": \n                    c:1, o:1, d:1, e:2, f:1, r:1, s:1, but wait: \n                    Actually, \"codeforces\": \n                        c:1, o:1, d:1, e:2, f:1, o:1 (wait, no: \"codeforces\": \n                        c, o, d, e, f, o, r, c, e, s -> wait, let me write: \n                        c, o, d, e, f, o, r, c, e, s -> so \n                            c:2, o:2, d:1, e:2, f:1, r:1, s:1\n\n                r: 'dodivthree': \n                    d:2, o:1, v:1, i:1, t:1, h:1, r:1, e:1\n\n                Now, for each color:\n\n                    c: min(2,0) = 0\n                    o: min(2,1)=1\n                    d: min(1,2)=1\n                    e: min(2,1)=1\n                    f: min(1,0)=0\n                    r: min(1,1)=1\n                    s: min(1,0)=0\n                    others:0\n\n                base = 0+1+1+1+0+1+0 = 4.\n\n                Then a = |L0| - base = 10 - 4 = 6\n                b = |R0| - base = 10 - 4 = 6\n                c = 0, d = 0\n\n                Then Type2: min(6,0)=0, Type3: min(6,0)=0, Type4: min(0-0,0-0)=0 -> total=4, but expected is 5.\n\n            So the formula must be wrong.\n\n  Revised Insight:\n\n    We must consider that we can use the '?' in the left to match non '?' in the right, and vice versa, even before using the base. Actually, the base (Type1) is the maximum matching we can get from non '?' to non '?'. Then, we have the freedom to use the '?' to match the remaining non '?' and then the '?' with each other.\n\n    However, the example above: base=4, then the remaining non '?' in left is 6, and in right is 6. But we have no '?' to use. So we cannot form more than 4 pairs.\n\n    But the example output is 5. So what's the issue?\n\n    Let me read the example input again: \n\n        Input: \n            10\n            codeforces\n            dodivthree\n\n        Expected Output:\n            5\n            7 8\n            4 9\n            2 2\n            9 10\n            3 1\n\n    The example output has 5 pairs. \n\n    The problem says: the i-th character of l and the i-th character of r.\n\n    The example input has two strings: \n        l = \"codeforces\"\n        r = \"dodivthree\"\n\n    The pairs are:\n\n        7 8 -> left boot7 (index6) and right boot8 (index7): \n            l[6] = 'e', r[7] = 'v' -> not the same, but wait, maybe we are matching arbitrarily? \n\n    Wait, the problem states: two boots are compatible if they are the same (if specific) or if at least one is '?'.\n\n    In the example, there are no '?', so all boots are specific. Then the pairs must be same colors.\n\n    How can we form 5 pairs?\n\n    Let me count the available letters in l and r:\n\n        l: \"codeforces\": \n            c:2, o:2, d:1, e:2, f:1, r:1, s:1\n        r: \"dodivthree\":\n            d:2, o:1, v:1, i:1, t:1, h:1, r:1, e:1\n\n    The base (matching same letters) is:\n\n        For 'd': min(1,2)=1\n        For 'o': min(2,1)=1\n        For 'e': min(2,1)=1\n        For 'c': min(2,0)=0\n        For 'f': min(1,0)=0\n        For 'r': min(1,1)=1\n        Others:0\n\n        base=4.\n\n    How do we get 5?\n\n    Note: the example output includes the pair (2,2): that is the second left boot and the second right boot.\n\n        Left boot2 (index1): 'o'\n        Right boot2 (index1): 'o' -> wait, but the second character of r is 'o'? \n            r = \"dodivthree\": \n                index0: 'd'\n                index1: 'o'\n                index2: 'd'\n                ...\n\n        So (2,2) is (index1, index1) -> 'o' and 'o' -> that is the 'o' from left and the 'o' from right. But wait, the base already counted the 'o' (we had one 'o' in base). \n\n        How did we get two 'o' pairs?\n\n        In the base, we matched one 'o'. But there are two 'o' in left and one in right. So we can match two 'o'? \n\n        Actually, the base matching for 'o' is min(2,1)=1. Then why is there a second 'o' being matched?\n\n        The example output has two pairs with 'o': \n            (2,2) and ... wait, let me list the pairs:\n\n            Pairs (using 1-indexed indices):\n\n                7 8: left7 (index6) is 'e', right8 (index7) is 'v' -> not compatible (unless we are matching with something else) -> wait, 'e' and 'v' are different.\n\n        Let me list the entire example output:\n\n            5\n            7 8\n            4 9\n            2 2\n            9 10\n            3 1\n\n        The boots:\n\n            Left: \n                1: 'c'\n                2: 'o'\n                3: 'd'\n                4: 'e'\n                5: 'f'\n                6: 'o'\n                7: 'r'\n                8: 'c'\n                9: 'e'\n                10: 's'\n\n            Right:\n                1: 'd'\n                2: 'o'\n                3: 'd'\n                4: 'i'\n                5: 'v'\n                6: 't'\n                7: 'h'\n                8: 'r'\n                9: 'e'\n                10: 'e'\n\n        Now, the pairs:\n\n            (7,8): left7='r', right8='r' -> compatible. (But wait, the example output says 7 8: left7 and right8 -> so that's correct for 'r')\n            (4,9): left4='e', right9='e' -> compatible.\n            (2,2): left2='o', right2='o' -> compatible.\n            (9,10): left9='e', right10='e' -> compatible.\n            (3,1): left3='d', right1='d' -> compatible.\n\n        Now, let's see the colors:\n\n            'r': two in left (at index6 and index7) and two in right? Actually, right has one 'r' at index7 (which is the 8th character) and one at index8? Wait, the right string is \"dodivthree\": \n                index0: 'd'\n                index1: 'o'\n                index2: 'd'\n                index3: 'i'\n                index4: 'v'\n                index5: 't'\n                index6: 'h'\n                index7: 'r'\n                index8: 'e'\n                index9: 'e'\n\n            So right has one 'r' at index7 (so the 8th character). Then the pair (7,8) is left7 (which is the 7th left boot, i.e., index6) and right8 (index7) -> that's one 'r'.\n\n            Then the base for 'r' is min(1,1)=1.\n\n            Similarly, for 'e': left has two 'e' (at index3 and index8) and right has two 'e' (at index8 and index9). So base for 'e' is min(2,2)=2.\n\n            For 'd': left has one 'd' (index2) and right has two 'd' (index0 and index2). So base for 'd' is min(1,2)=1.\n\n            For 'o': left has two 'o' (index1 and index5) and right has one 'o' (index1). So base for 'o' is min(2,1)=1.\n\n            Then base = 1 (for 'r') + 2 (for 'e') + 1 (for 'd') + 1 (for 'o') = 5.\n\n            So the base is 5.\n\n        Why did I initially count base=4? Because I miscounted the 'e' in left: I thought left had two 'e's, but then I saw the string \"codeforces\": \n            'c','o','d','e','f','o','r','c','e','s' -> indeed two 'e's.\n\n        And the right string \"dodivthree\": \n            'd','o','d','i','v','t','h','r','e','e' -> two 'e's.\n\n        So base=5.\n\n        Then the formula: base=5, and then a = 10 - 5 = 5, b = 10 -5 =5, c=0, d=0 -> no more pairs.\n\n        So the total pairs is 5.\n\n        Then the formula holds: base + min(a,d) + min(b,c) + min(c - min(b,c), d - min(a,d)) = 5 + 0 + 0 + 0 =5.\n\n        But wait, in the example, there are no '?' so the additional terms are zero.\n\n        Now, let's test with the example that had '?' and non '?':\n\n            Example: \n                l = \"a?\" \n                r = \"?b\"\n\n            base: \n                L0 = ['a'] (non '?'), R0 = ['b'] (non '?')\n                base = min(count_a, count_b) = min(1,1) = 0 (since 'a' != 'b')\n\n            Then a = |L0| - base = 1 - 0 = 1\n            b = |R0| - base = 1 - 0 = 1\n            c = 1, d=1\n\n            Then:\n                Type2: min(a, d) = min(1,1)=1\n                Type3: min(b, c)=min(1,1)=1\n                Type4: min(c - min(b,c), d - min(a,d)) = min(1-1, 1-1)=0\n\n            Total = 0+1+1+0=2.\n\n        Another example with mixed:\n\n            l = \"a?b\"\n            r = \"c?d\"\n\n            base: \n                L0 = ['a','b'], R0 = ['c','d'] -> no common letters -> base=0\n            a=2, b=2, c=1, d=1\n            Type2: min(2,1)=1\n            Type3: min(2,1)=1\n            Type4: min(1-1, 1-1)=0\n            Total=2.\n\n        But wait, we have three left and three right. Can we form 2 pairs? Yes, because the third left boot is '?' and the third right boot is '?', but we already used the '?' for the non '?' ones. Actually, we have only one '?' in left and one in right. We used them for the non '?' matches. Then the remaining '?' (none) so no more.\n\n        However, note: the base did not use the '?' at all. In the base step, we only used non '?' and the non '?' didn't match, so we didn't use any '?'.\n\n        Then, we have two non '?' in left and two non '?' in right, and two '?' (one in left and one in right). \n\n        We can use the '?' to match the non '?'? \n\n        But our formula: Type2: min(a, d) = min(2,1)=1 -> meaning we use one of the non '?' in left with the one '?' in right.\n        Type3: min(b, c)=min(2,1)=1 -> meaning we use one of the non '?' in right with the one '?' in left.\n\n        Then, the remaining non '?' in left is 2-1=1, and in right is 2-1=1. Then, we have no '?' left (the one '?' in left was used in Type3 and the one in right was used in Type2). Then, we try to match the remaining non '?' (a and b in left, and c and d in right) but they are different, so no.\n\n        So total pairs=2.\n\n        But wait, we have three left and three right. We used two left boots and two right boots. We cannot use the same boot twice. The two '?' boots are distinct from the non '?' boots. So we used:\n\n            left: two non '?' and one '?' (for the Type3)\n            right: two non '?' and one '?' (for the Type2)\n\n        Then the remaining boots are one non '?' in left (say 'a') and one non '?' in right (say 'c') -> not compatible.\n\n        So 2 is the maximum.\n\n        But note: we could also use the '?' in left to match the non '?' in right and the '?' in right to match the non '?' in left, but that is what we did.\n\n        Now, the challenge is to output the actual pairs.\n\n  Algorithm to output the pairs:\n\n    We have four types:\n\n        Type1: non '?' matching non '?' (same color)\n        Type2: non '?' in left with '?' in right\n        Type3: non '?' in right with '?' in left\n        Type4: '?' in left with '?' in right\n\n    Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Count base = for each color, min(count_left_non[c], count_right_non[c])\n\n        Step 2: For Type1, we need to assign specific indices. We can do:\n\n            For each color c:\n                Let L_list[c] = sorted list of indices i where l[i]==c and i is non '?'\n                Let R_list[c] = sorted list of indices i where r[i]==c and i is non '?'\n\n                Then, for min(L_list[c], R_list[c]), we can take the smallest indices from both and form pairs.\n\n        Step 3: Then, we have:\n\n            remaining_left_non = {}\n            For each color c, we remove min(L_list[c], R_list[c]) from L_list[c] and R_list[c].\n\n            Then, for Type2: we want to match the remaining non '?' in left (which are the ones not used in Type1) with the '?' in right.\n\n            But note: we can choose arbitrarily. We want to minimize the disturbance for Type4.\n\n            However, we want to maximize the total pairs, and we already know the total is base + min(remaining_left_non_count, qr) + min(remaining_right_non_count, ql) + min(ql - min(remaining_right_non_count, ql), qr - min(remaining_left_non_count, qr))\n\n            But note: the remaining_left_non_count is the total non '?' left minus the base, and similarly for right.\n\n            However, we have to assign specific indices.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n            We'll create:\n\n                left_non = [] # list of (index, color) for non '?' in left\n                left_q = []   # list of (index) for '?' in left\n                right_non = [] # list of (index, color) for non '?' in right\n                right_q = []   # list of (index) for '?' in right\n\n            Step 1: base matching for non '?'.\n\n            We can use a dictionary for the non '?' in left and right.\n\n            Then, for each color, we match the smallest indices from left_non and right_non.\n\n            Then, we remove the matched indices from left_non and right_non.\n\n            Step 2: Then, we have:\n\n                remaining_left_non = left_non   (but we removed the matched ones, so we have the unmatched non '?' in left)\n                remaining_right_non = right_non   (unmatched non '?' in right)\n\n                Then, for Type2: we want",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots (left and right) where each pair consists of boots with matching colors or one of them being a wildcard ('?'). The solution involves efficiently matching the boots while adhering to the constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. A specific color matches another specific color if they are the same. A wildcard '?' matches any color (specific or wildcard). The goal is to maximize the number of such pairs without reusing any boot.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The solution can be broken down into four types of matches:\n   - **Type 1**: Match non-wildcard left boots with non-wildcard right boots of the same color.\n   - **Type 2**: Match remaining non-wildcard left boots with wildcard right boots.\n   - **Type 3**: Match remaining non-wildcard right boots with wildcard left boots.\n   - **Type 4**: Match wildcard left boots with wildcard right boots.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Step 1**: Count and match non-wildcard boots of the same color (Type 1). This involves using a frequency map to count occurrences of each color in both left and right boots, then matching the smallest indices first to ensure optimal pairing.\n   - **Step 2**: After matching Type 1, match the remaining non-wildcard boots with wildcards (Types 2 and 3). This is done by greedily matching the remaining non-wildcard boots with available wildcards.\n   - **Step 3**: Finally, match any remaining wildcards with each other (Type 4).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each boot exactly once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of boots. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the boot indices and color counts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    data =

boots.\n2. **Categorizing Boots**: Boots are categorized into non-wildcard and wildcard lists based on their color.\n3. **Matching Non-Wildcard Boots**: For each color, the algorithm matches the smallest indices from left and right non-wildcard lists to form pairs (Type 1).\n4. **Handling Remaining Non-Wildcard Boots**: Any remaining non-wildcard boots are matched with wildcards (Types 2 and 3).\n5. **Matching Wildcards**: Wildcards are matched with each other if no other matches are possible (Type 4).\n6. **Output**: The results are printed, showing the number of pairs and the indices of each pair, formatted according to the problem requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible compatible pairs are formed efficiently, maximizing the number of pairs while adhering to the constraints.",
