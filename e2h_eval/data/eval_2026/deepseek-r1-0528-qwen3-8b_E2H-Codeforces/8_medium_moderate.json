Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an undirected graph and a flow volume for each edge. We need to assign a direction (0 or 1) to each edge such that:\n   - For each vertex v (except the source and sink), the total incoming flow equals the total outgoing flow.\n   - The source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges (so all its edges must be outgoing).\n   - The directed graph must not have cycles.\n\n However, note that the problem states that the graph is connected and a solution exists.\n\n Observation: The conditions resemble the conservation of flow at each vertex (except source and sink). The source must have net outflow and the sink net inflow.\n\n Since we are allowed to choose any solution, one way is to use a DFS/BFS to assign directions in a spanning tree (like a directed acyclic graph) and then orient the remaining edges arbitrarily without creating cycles? But note: the entire graph must form a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and satisfy the conservation condition.\n\n Another idea: Think of the flow as having multiple paths from source to sink. Each edge can carry flow in one direction only.\n\n We can use the concept of an arborescence (rooted tree) but here we have multiple edges and we need to satisfy conservation at every vertex (which means the graph is a pseudoforest? Actually, the graph must be acyclic and each vertex (except source) has in-degree equal to one? Not exactly: it's a flow decomposition into paths and cycles, but the problem says no cycles. So we are decomposing the flow into paths (and possibly cycles, but cycles are forbidden so we must avoid them). Therefore, the flow must be decomposed into paths from source to sink.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We know the source is vertex 1 and sink is vertex n.\n\n 2. We are given m edges with capacities. The problem does not require the flow value to be maximized (we are just assigning directions) but the conditions must hold. However, note: the problem says the algorithm already computed the flow, so we are just directing the edges.\n\n 3. Conditions for a valid assignment:\n    a. Vertex 1 has no incoming edges -> so all edges incident to vertex 1 must be directed away from 1.\n    b. For each vertex v (not source/sink): \n          sum_{edges into v} (flow volume) = sum_{edges out of v} (flow volume)\n\n    c. The directed graph must be acyclic.\n\n 4. How to approach?\n\n One known fact: In a maximum flow, the residual graph has no augmenting paths. But here we are not computing flow, we are assigning directions.\n\n Alternatively, note that the flow conservation condition is similar to an electrical circuit (current conservation). We can use a DFS tree and assign directions along the tree edges from root (source) to leaves, and then the remaining edges (non-tree) would have to be assigned in a way that doesn't create cycles and conserves flow.\n\n However, the problem does not specify which flow decomposition to use.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n Since the graph is undirected and we have a fixed set of flows, we can think of the following:\n\n   - The entire flow must be from source to sink. Therefore, the graph must have an orientation such that the underlying DAG has the source as the unique minimal element and the sink as the unique maximal element? Not necessarily, because there might be multiple paths.\n\n   - We can try to build a spanning tree (or forest) that connects the source to the sink, and then assign directions for the tree edges from the source to the sink (so that the tree is directed from root to leaves). Then for non-tree edges, we can assign directions arbitrarily as long as they don't create cycles and the conservation holds.\n\n But note: the conservation condition must hold for every vertex. The tree edges we direct from root to leaves will satisfy conservation for the vertices on the tree? Only if we also account for the non-tree edges.\n\n However, note that the flow is given and fixed. The problem does not ask to compute the flow, only to assign directions.\n\n Let me reframe: We are given an undirected graph with edge weights (flows). We wish to orient each edge (with two possibilities) so that:\n\n   - The source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges (so for each edge incident to 1, we must direct it from 1 to the neighbor).\n   - For every vertex v (other than 1 and n), the sum of the flows of the incoming edges equals the sum of the flows of the outgoing edges.\n\n And the directed graph must be acyclic.\n\n But note: the entire flow is fixed. The problem does not require the flow value to be adjusted, so the total flow is the same as the original graph's edge flows. However, the conservation condition must hold.\n\n However, note that the flow conservation condition is linear and the graph is connected. Also, we are guaranteed a solution exists.\n\n Steps:\n\n   a. Since the source (vertex 1) must have no incoming, we set all edges incident to the source to go out from the source.\n\n   b. Then, we must ensure that for every vertex, the inflow equals the outflow. This is similar to having a circulation, but note: the source and sink are special.\n\n   However, wait: the flow is from source to sink, so the source must have outflow and the sink must have inflow. For other vertices, the inflow must equal outflow.\n\n   We can model this as: we have an initial assignment for the source's edges (all out). Then, we traverse the graph and adjust the directions of edges so that the conservation holds.\n\n But note: the entire flow is fixed and we cannot change the capacity. We are only choosing the direction.\n\n Another idea: Use a BFS/DFS starting from the source and assign directions for edges in a way that forms a layered graph. Then, the edges that are not in the BFS tree can be assigned arbitrarily as long as they don't create cycles.\n\n However, note: the condition of being acyclic and the flow conservation must be satisfied.\n\n Known fact: The problem is equivalent to decomposing the graph into a set of edge-disjoint paths from source to sink (each path being a directed path) and then the residual graph (which we don't care about) but note: we are not decomposing the flow, we are just assigning directions.\n\n But note: the problem does not require the flow to be decomposed; it requires that the entire assignment satisfies conservation and acyclicity.\n\n Approach:\n\n   Step 1: Start by setting the direction of all edges incident to the source (vertex 1) to be outgoing (i.e., 0 if the edge is (1, u) then output 0 meaning 1->u; if the edge is (u,1) then output 1 meaning u->1? But wait: the input gives an undirected edge. The problem says: output 0 if the direction is ai->bi, and 1 otherwise.\n\n   However, note: the input edge is given as (ai, bi). We have to decide for that edge: either ai->bi (0) or bi->ai (1).\n\n   But the condition for the source: no incoming. So if the edge is (1, u) then we must direct it as 1->u (so output 0). If the edge is (u, 1) then we must direct it as u->1 (so output 1) — but wait, that would make an incoming edge to the source, which is disallowed. \n\n   Therefore, for an edge (u,1) we must direct it as u->1 (so the source gets an incoming edge) — but wait, that violates the condition. \n\n   Let me clarify: the condition says \"vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges\". Therefore, for an edge connecting u and 1, we must direct it from 1 to u (so that the flow goes from source to u). But the input representation is undirected. So if the input edge is (1, u) then we know we have to direct it from 1 to u. Similarly, if the input edge is (u,1) then we have to direct it from 1 to u as well.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"the i-th edge\" is given by (ai, bi). So we are free to interpret the edge arbitrarily. But the condition applies: the source (vertex 1) must not have any incoming.\n\n   Therefore, for any edge that has vertex 1, we must direct the flow from vertex 1 to the other endpoint.\n\n   Step 2: Then, we have to assign directions for the remaining edges (edges that do not touch the source) such that the conservation condition holds at every vertex (except source and sink) and the entire graph is acyclic.\n\n   How to assign the rest?\n\n   We can use a BFS starting from the source and then for each edge (u, v) (with u and v not being the source) we have two choices. But note: the flow conservation condition must hold. \n\n   Idea: We can use the concept of an arborescence (rooted tree) and then use the residual graph to balance the flows.\n\n   However, note: the graph is not necessarily a tree. We are going to have a spanning tree? But the graph might be large.\n\n   Another idea: We can use a DFS (or BFS) to traverse the graph and whenever we meet an edge, we direct it from the current node to the next if the next node hasn't been visited, and if visited then we reverse the direction? But wait, that might create cycles.\n\n   Actually, we can use the following:\n\n     - We know the source has fixed outgoing edges.\n\n     - Then, we do a BFS/DFS from the source and for each edge (u, v) we consider:\n\n        If we are traversing from u to v and v is unvisited, then we direct the edge from u to v (output 0 for the edge (u, v) as given) and then continue from v.\n\n        If we are traversing from u to v and v is visited, then we must direct the edge from v to u (so output 1 for the edge (u, v))? But wait, what if the edge is given as (u, v) and we are at u and then we see v is visited, then we direct it backwards.\n\n   However, is that always safe? Consider:\n\n        We have a cycle. When we first encounter the edge from u to v, we direct u->v. Then when we meet the edge from v to u again, we direct it from v->u. But then we have a cycle: u->v and v->u. That creates a cycle.\n\n   So we cannot use a simple DFS that reverses edges arbitrarily.\n\n   Alternative: We use a spanning tree (or forest) and then direct the tree edges from the source to the leaves (so that the tree is a directed tree). Then, for the remaining edges (non-tree edges), we direct them arbitrarily in the direction from the vertex closer to the source to the vertex farther from the source? Or the opposite?\n\n   Why would that work?\n\n   Condition for conservation: In a directed tree (arborescence) from the source, each vertex (except source) has exactly one incoming edge (from the tree). Then, to satisfy conservation, we must have one outgoing edge for each vertex (if we consider the tree edge as incoming then we must have an outgoing edge of the same capacity elsewhere). But wait, the capacities are fixed and may not match.\n\n   Actually, note: the capacities are fixed and the entire flow must be accounted for. The conservation condition must hold for every vertex. \n\n   Let me denote:\n\n        Let f(e) be the flow direction: 0 if from (a to b) as given, 1 if from (b to a) as given.\n\n        Then, for vertex v, we have:\n            Sum_{e incident to v} [if the edge is directed toward v then we take the flow as positive, else negative] = 0, except for the source and sink.\n\n        Source: total outflow = total inflow = 0 (no inflow) -> so outflow must be the entire flow that leaves the source.\n        Sink: total inflow = total outflow = 0 (no outflow) -> so inflow must be the entire flow that arrives at the sink.\n\n   But note: the flow is not necessarily unit flow. It's integer capacities.\n\n   However, we are not told the exact flow value. We are only told the capacities for each edge.\n\n   How can we assign directions? \n\n   Insight from graph theory: The problem is equivalent to finding an acyclic orientation of the graph such that the source has out-degree equal to the sum of the capacities of edges incident to it (in the undirected sense) and the sink has in-degree equal to the sum of the capacities of edges incident to it, and for every other vertex, the in-degree (counting the capacity of the edge) times the orientation (if oriented toward the vertex) minus the out-degree (oriented away) times the capacity must be zero.\n\n   But note: the capacities are fixed and the orientation is binary. We have to assign 0 or 1 to each edge.\n\n   This is a linear system. However, the graph is large (up to 200,000 edges and vertices) so we cannot solve a system of equations.\n\n   Another idea: Use the concept of a spanning tree and then assign the non-tree edges in a way that does not create cycles and then adjust the directions of edges in the tree to satisfy the conservation. But note: we fixed the source's edges.\n\n   Let me try a simpler example:\n\n        Input: \"3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5\"\n\n        Edges: \n            e1: 3-2 with capacity 10\n            e2: 1-2 with capacity 10\n            e3: 3-1 with capacity 5\n\n        Conditions:\n            Source (vertex 1) must have no incoming. So for e3 (3-1): we must direct it as 1->3 (so output 1 for edge (3,1) meaning the direction is from 3 to 1? Wait, let's read the output specification: \n                Output: 0 if the direction is ai->bi, 1 if bi->ai.\n\n            But note: the input edge is given as (ai, bi). For e3: (3,1) so if we output 1, that means we direct it as 1->3? Actually, the problem says: \n                \"each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise.\"\n\n            So for edge (3,1): \n                If we output 0, then the direction is 3->1 (so from 3 to 1) -> but then vertex 1 gets an incoming edge of 5, which is allowed? No, wait: the condition says vertex 1 must have no incoming. So we must not have an incoming edge to vertex 1.\n\n            Therefore, we must direct the edge (3,1) as 1->3 (so the flow goes from 1 to 3). But the input representation is (3,1). To represent 1->3, we must output 1 (because 1 is not the first vertex, so the direction is reversed).\n\n            Similarly, for edge (1,2): we must direct it as 1->2, so output 0.\n\n            Now for edge (3,2): we have two possibilities.\n\n            The conservation condition at vertex 2: \n                Incoming edges: from 1 (capacity 10) and from 3 (capacity x, where x is either 10 if we direct 3->2, or 0 if we direct 2->3).\n                Outgoing edges: from 2 to 3 (if we direct 3->2 then we have no outgoing from 2 to 3, but if we direct 2->3 then we have an outgoing of 10).\n\n            We require: \n                Incoming = Outgoing.\n\n            Let's assume we direct (3,2) as 3->2 (output 0). Then:\n                Vertex 2: \n                    Incoming: from 1 (10) and from 3 (10) -> total 20.\n                    Outgoing: from 2 to 3: none (if we direct 3->2, then the edge (3,2) is from 3 to 2, so outgoing from 2 is 0).\n                    So 20 != 0 -> invalid.\n\n            Now, if we direct (3,2) as 2->3 (output 1): \n                Vertex 2:\n                    Incoming: from 1 (10)\n                    Outgoing: from 2 to 3: 10\n                    So 10 == 10 -> valid.\n\n            Also, check vertex 3:\n                Incoming: from 1 (5) and from 2 (10) [if we direct (3,2) as 2->3 then from 2 to 3 is 10] -> total 15.\n                Outgoing: from 3 to 1: 5, from 3 to 2: 0 (because we reversed the edge (3,2) so now it's from 2 to 3, so no outgoing from 3 to 2) -> total 5.\n                15 != 5 -> invalid.\n\n            What's wrong? \n\n            Let me recast the entire flow:\n\n                The total flow leaving the source (vertex 1) is 10 (edge to 2) + 5 (edge to 3) = 15.\n                The total flow arriving at the sink (vertex 3) is 5 (from edge 1->3) + 10 (from edge 2->3) = 15.\n\n                But then what happens at vertex 2?\n                Flow from 1 to 2: 10, then from 2 to 3: 10. So vertex 2 sends 10 to 3, but how does it get the extra 10? It got 10 from the source. So that matches.\n\n                Now vertex 3: \n                    Received from 1: 5, from 2: 10 -> total 15.\n                    Sends to 1: 5. \n                    So the net flow at vertex 3 is 15 (in) and 5 (out) -> 15 - 5 = 10. But wait, the condition is that for vertex 3 (which is not the source or sink) the inflow must equal the outflow. Here, inflow=15, outflow=5 -> not equal.\n\n            But note: the problem does not specify that the sink (vertex n) must have no outgoing edges? Actually, the condition says: \"vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges\", and then \"for each vertex v (1 < v < n)\" -> so the sink (vertex n) is excluded from the conservation condition. \n\n            Correction: the problem states: \"for each vertex v (1 < v < n)\" -> so vertex 3 (sink) is not included. \n\n            Therefore, we only require conservation for vertices 2 to n-1 (if n>2). \n\n            In this example, n=3, so we require conservation only for vertex 2 (since 1 < v < 3, so v=2). \n\n            Vertex 3 is the sink, so no condition.\n\n            Then the assignment is:\n                Edge1 (3,2): output 1 -> meaning the edge is directed from 2 to 3 (so 2->3).\n                Edge2 (1,2): output 0 -> meaning 1->2.\n                Edge3 (3,1): output 1 -> meaning 1->3.\n\n            Then the graph has edges: 1->2, 1->3, and 2->3. This is acyclic.\n\n            Now, check vertex 2: \n                Incoming: from 1 (10)\n                Outgoing: to 3 (10) -> equal.\n\n            Vertex 1: no incoming, good.\n            Vertex 3: no condition.\n\n            So the answer for the example is: \n                Edge1: 1\n                Edge2: 0\n                Edge3: 1\n\n            Which matches the example output.\n\n   So the problem reduces to:\n\n        Step 1: For every edge that is incident to the source (vertex 1), direct it from the source to the other vertex (so output 0 if the edge is (1, u) and output 1 if the edge is (u,1)).\n\n        Step 2: Then, we must assign the remaining edges (not incident to the source) such that:\n\n            a. The graph remains acyclic (so we are building a DAG).\n            b. For every vertex v (except source and sink), the total flow coming in equals the total flow going out.\n\n        How to assign the rest?\n\n        We can use a BFS/DFS to traverse the graph (excluding the source) and then for each edge (u, v) we consider:\n\n            We know the direction from the source to u is fixed (if u is reached via a directed path from the source, then we know the \"level\" or the distance from the source). \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n            - Do a BFS starting from the source, and assign a level (distance) to each vertex. Then, for an edge (u, v):\n\n                If level[u] < level[v], then we direct the edge from u to v (so output 0 for the edge (u, v) as given) because that would help the flow to go forward.\n\n                If level[u] > level[v], then we direct the edge from v to u (so output 1 for the edge (u, v) as given) because we are going backward.\n\n                If level[u] == level[v], then we have a problem: we cannot have an edge between two vertices of the same level without creating a cycle? \n\n        But wait, if we use BFS levels, then we require the graph to be leveled by the BFS. However, if we have an edge between two vertices of the same level, then we must direct it arbitrarily? \n\n        However, note: in a BFS tree, we don't traverse edges that connect two nodes of the same level. But we have to assign a direction to every edge.\n\n        How does the conservation condition hold?\n\n        Consider an edge (u, v) with level[u] == level[v]. Then we can choose arbitrarily. But note: the conservation condition might be broken if we don't account for the flow.\n\n        But observe: the entire flow is fixed. The condition is that for each vertex, the inflow equals the outflow. \n\n        However, if we use BFS levels (like in a layered network for max flow) then the forward edges (from low level to high) are used for pushing flow, and backward edges (high to low) are used for returning flow. \n\n        In fact, the residual graph is built with forward edges (with the same capacity) and backward edges (with capacity also the same, but negative). \n\n        But note: in our problem, we are not building the residual graph but the flow graph. However, the conservation condition is naturally satisfied by the residual graph.\n\n        But wait, we are only given the graph and the flow volumes (capacities). The problem does not specify the flow value. \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges.\" and \"the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow\".\n\n        So the entire flow is the one that was computed by his algorithm. But note: the flow decomposition is fixed by the capacities.\n\n        However, the problem does not give the flow value per edge in the directed graph. It only gives the capacity (which is the same as the flow volume) for the undirected edge. \n\n        The catch: the flow volume that passes through an edge in one direction might be less than or equal to the capacity. But the problem does not specify the breakdown.\n\n        After reading the problem statement again: \"it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. ... it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction.\"\n\n        So the flow volume given for each edge is the total capacity that can be used in both directions? Or is it the capacity of the undirected edge?\n\n        And then we are to assign a direction so that the flow (as a circulation? or as a flow from source to sink) is correct.\n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"the obtained directed graph does not have cycles\". So the flow must be decomposed into paths (without cycles) from source to sink.\n\n        Therefore, the entire flow must be decomposable into paths from source to sink. \n\n        How can we assign directions to the edges to form a set of source-to-sink paths (without cycles) and the capacities of the edges are the maximum flow that can be sent along that edge in the chosen direction?\n\n        But note: the problem does not require the flow value to be the maximum flow (it is already computed) but the directions must form a correct maximum flow.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow\".\n\n        So we must assign directions such that the total flow from source to sink is the maximum flow (but note: the capacities are fixed, so the maximum flow is fixed). \n\n        But wait: the capacities are given for the undirected edges. The maximum flow is independent of the direction? Actually, the undirected graph can be converted to a directed graph by replacing each undirected edge by two directed edges (one in each direction) with capacity equal to the given ci. Then the maximum flow is computed on that directed graph? \n\n        However, the problem says the program only outputs the flow volume for each edge (without direction). \n\n        And then we have to assign directions to form a correct maximum flow.\n\n        How can we assign directions? \n\n        There are multiple ways to assign directions to form a maximum flow. For example, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson method and record the residual graph, then the residual graph tells us the directions.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require the specific flow, only that the conditions hold and the graph is acyclic.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"the obtained directed graph does not have cycles\", meaning the directed graph must be acyclic. But note: the flow decomposition into paths does not require the entire graph to be acyclic? Actually, the flow graph (with multiple paths) might have cycles if we allow arbitrary assignments? \n\n        But the problem requires no cycles. \n\n        Important: The condition \"does not have cycles\" is very strong. This means the entire directed graph is a DAG.\n\n        Therefore, the flow must be decomposed into paths (without cycles) and the underlying graph must be a DAG.\n\n        Then, one way is to assign directions so that the graph is a DAG and the flow conservation holds.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          1. Direct all edges incident to the source away from the source.\n          2. Then, perform a topological sort (or use BFS with levels) to assign directions for the remaining edges.\n\n        However, note: we are not given the flow value, only the capacities. But the problem does not require the flow value to be maintained, but the conservation condition.\n\n        Actually, the conservation condition is: for each vertex (except source and sink) the inflow must equal the outflow.\n\n        And the entire flow from the source must equal the flow to the sink.\n\n        But the capacities are fixed. How can we assign directions arbitrarily?\n\n        The key: the problem says \"a solution always exists\". \n\n        Another idea: use the concept of an arborescence (directed tree) from the source, and then the remaining edges are used to redirect flow (like residual edges). But note: we require a DAG.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          - Build a spanning tree (using BFS/DFS) starting from the source, and direct all tree edges away from the source.\n\n          - Then, for the non-tree edges, we direct them from the vertex closer to the source to the vertex farther from the source? \n\n        Why would that work for conservation?\n\n        Example: \n            n=3, edges: (1,2,10), (1,3,5), (2,3,10)\n\n            Step1: direct (1,2) as 1->2 (0) and (1,3) as 1->3 (1 for the edge (3,1) -> wait, we have to be consistent with the input order.\n\n            Our input edges are:\n\n                Edge1: (3,2,10) -> we haven't processed yet.\n                Edge2: (1,2,10)\n                Edge3: (3,1,5)\n\n            Step1: process edges incident to 1: \n                Edge2: (1,2) -> direct as 1->2 -> output 0.\n                Edge3: (3,1) -> direct as 1->3 -> output 1.\n\n            Now, the BFS tree from source (vertex1) includes edges (1,2) and (1,3). Then the edge (3,2) is a non-tree edge.\n\n            Now, for the non-tree edge (3,2): \n                We compare the levels: \n                    level[1]=0, level[2]=1, level[3]=1.\n                    For edge (3,2): the two endpoints are at level 1 (same level). \n\n            How to direct an edge between two nodes of the same level? \n\n            We must direct it from the one that is \"earlier\" in the BFS order to the later? \n\n            But note: BFS gives the same level to nodes that are at the same distance. \n\n            However, we can break ties arbitrarily? \n\n            But the conservation condition: \n\n                Vertex2: \n                    Incoming: from 1 (10) and from 3 (if we direct 3->2 then 10, else 0).\n                    Outgoing: from 2 to 3 (if we direct 2->3 then 10, else 0).\n\n                We require: Incoming = Outgoing.\n\n                If we direct 3->2 (output 0 for the edge (3,2)): \n                    Vertex2: Incoming=10 (from 1) + 10 (from 3) = 20, Outgoing=0 -> not equal.\n\n                If we direct 2->3 (output 1 for the edge (3,2)):\n                    Vertex2: Incoming=10, Outgoing=10 -> equal.\n\n                Vertex3: \n                    Incoming: from 1 (5) and from 2 (10) [if we direct 2->3 then 10] -> 15\n                    Outgoing: from 3 to 1 (5) and from 3 to 2 (0) -> 5\n                    But note: the condition for vertex3 (sink) is not required, but wait: the problem says vertex v (1 < v < n) so for n=3, v=2 only. Vertex3 is sink, so no condition.\n\n                However, what about vertex3 if n>3? Then we require conservation.\n\n            But in this example, n=3, so vertex3 is sink. \n\n            However, note the example input: \n                \"3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5\"\n\n            The example output is:\n                1\n                0\n                1\n\n            So the third edge (which is (3,1)) is output 1, and the first edge (3,2) is output 1.\n\n            So the assignment for the first edge (3,2) is 1 (meaning 2->3) and for the third edge (3,1) is 1 (meaning 1->3).\n\n            So the non-tree edge (3,2) is directed from 2 to 3.\n\n            How did we decide? \n\n            We can use the following rule for non-tree edges:\n\n                For an edge (u, v) (not incident to the source), if the two vertices are in the same BFS level, then we direct the edge from the one that was visited later to the one visited earlier? \n\n            Actually, in BFS we visit neighbors in some order. We can break ties by the order of discovery.\n\n            Algorithm:\n\n                Let's maintain:\n                  level[1] = 0\n                  parent[1] = None\n\n                We do BFS from the source, and for each edge (u, v) that we encounter:\n\n                  Case 1: If v is unvisited, then we set level[v] = level[u] + 1, parent[v]=u, and direct the edge from u to v (so output 0 for the edge (u, v) as given) and then push v into the queue.\n\n                  Case 2: If v is visited, then:\n                    - If v is the parent of u, then skip (this is a tree edge, but we've already set the direction from parent to child).\n                    - Else, then the edge is a back edge (non-tree). Then, we must direct it from the vertex with the higher level to the lower level? Or from lower to higher?\n\n            But wait, in a BFS tree, if we see an edge (u, v) and v is visited and not the parent of u, then the level of u and v must be either the same or differ by one. Actually, if we are doing BFS, then the level of u and v can be the same or differ by one? \n\n            Actually, if we encounter an edge (u, v) and v is visited, then:\n\n              - If level[u] < level[v]: then v was visited earlier (so we don't use this edge to update u, but we have a non-tree edge from a lower level to a higher level? Actually, no: in BFS we set the level when we first visit, so if we see an edge from u to v and v is already visited, then level[u] and level[v] could be:\n\n                  Option A: level[u] = level[v] (then we have an edge between two nodes of the same level) -> we call this a horizontal edge.\n                  Option B: level[u] = level[v] - 1 (then we have a tree edge, but then v is parent of u, so we skip)\n                  Option C: level[u] = level[v] + 1 (then we have a backward edge from a deeper node to a shallower node)\n\n            Actually, in BFS we start from the source and visit neighbors in increasing order. So if we see an edge (u, v) and v is visited, then:\n\n                If level[u] < level[v]: then we have a forward edge (from a node closer to source to a node farther) -> we can direct it from u to v (output 0) and ignore the reverse because the forward direction is already set by the BFS tree.\n\n                But wait, we are not building a tree anymore. We are assigning directions for every edge.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use a union-find or DFS to avoid cycles, but the condition of being acyclic is global.\n\n        Revised plan:\n\n            We know the source must have outgoing edges. Then, we want to assign directions so that the entire graph is acyclic and the conservation condition holds.\n\n            Note: the conservation condition is automatically satisfied if we decompose the flow into paths (without cycles) and the graph is a DAG. \n\n            How to assign directions for the entire graph?\n\n            We can use a DFS-like traversal that assigns directions based on the order of discovery. However, the problem size is up to 200,000.\n\n        Another idea: \n\n            Step 1: Direct all edges incident to the source as outgoing.\n\n            Step 2: Remove the source and contract the graph? \n\n            But then we have to handle the entire graph.\n\n        Insight from the problem: the flow is maximum and the graph is undirected. We can use the following theorem:\n\n            In any maximum flow, there exists a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that represents the flow.\n\n        However, we are not constrained by the flow value, only by the capacities.\n\n        After research, one standard way to represent a flow in a graph is by the residual graph. But the residual graph has edges in both directions (forward and backward). \n\n        But note: the problem requires no cycles and the graph is directed.\n\n        Actually, the flow in a DAG is decomposed into paths (without cycles). \n\n        We can use a BFS from the source to assign layers (like in Dinic's algorithm) and then direct the edges from lower layer to higher layer for the forward edges, and the backward edges (which are the reverse of the forward edges) are not used? \n\n        However, the capacities are fixed. \n\n        But note: the problem does not specify the flow value. We are only given the capacities for the undirected edges.\n\n        The maximum flow in the graph is the minimum cut. But we don't know the cut.\n\n        However, we are guaranteed that a solution exists.\n\n        Standard approach for representing a maximum flow in an undirected graph as a directed graph without cycles:\n\n            We can use the following: \n\n                For each edge (u, v) with capacity c, we can send flow from u to v and then the residual capacity from v to u is c (the same). But then the entire directed graph would have cycles if we include both forward and backward edges.\n\n            But the problem requires no cycles.\n\n        So we must not include backward edges? \n\n        But wait, the example did not use backward edges. \n\n        How did the example work? \n\n            The example had three edges. The directed edges were:\n\n                (1,2) with capacity 10\n                (1,3) with capacity 5\n                (2,3) with capacity 10 (directed from 2 to 3)\n\n            This is a DAG.\n\n        How can we generalize?\n\n            We can use",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to assign directions to each edge in an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies specific conditions: the source vertex (vertex 1) has no incoming edges, every other vertex (except the sink) has equal incoming and outgoing flow sums, and the entire graph is acyclic. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Edge Direction for Source Vertex**: All edges connected to the source vertex (vertex 1) must be directed away from it. This ensures the source has no incoming edges.\n2. **BFS for Level Assignment**: Perform a BFS starting from the source vertex to assign levels (distances) to all vertices. This helps in determining the direction of edges not incident to the source.\n3. **Edge Direction Based on Levels**: For edges not connected to the source:\n   - If one endpoint is at a higher level than the other, direct the edge from the lower level to the higher level. This ensures no cycles are formed.\n   - If both endpoints are at the same level, direct the edge from the vertex discovered later during BFS to the one discovered earlier. This also avoids cycles while maintaining flow conservation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    it = iter(data)\n    n = int(next(it)); m = int(next(it))\n    \n    edges = []\n    for i in range(m):\n        a = int(next(it)); b = int(next(it)); c = int(next(it))\n        edges.append((a, b, c))\n        \n    res = [0] * m\n    \n    level = [-1] * (n+1)\n    parent = [-1] * (n+1)\n    order = []\n    q = deque()\n    level[1] = 0\n    q.append(1)\n    while q:\n        u = q.popleft()\n        order.append(u)\n        for idx, (a, b, c) in enumerate(edges):\n            if (u == a and b == u) or (u == b and a == u):\n                pos = idx\n                if res[pos] == 0:\n                    continue\n                else:\n                    res[pos] = 1\n            elif (u == a):\n                v = b\n                if level[v] == -1:\n                    level[v] = level[u] + 1\n                    parent[v] = u\n                    q.append(v)\n                    for idx_edge, (a_edge, b_edge, c_edge) in enumerate(edges):\n                        if (a_edge == u and b_edge == v) or (a_edge == v and b_edge == u):\n                            pos = idx_edge\n                            if res[pos] == 0:\n                                if level[u] < level[v]:\n                                    pass\n                            else:\n                                if level[u] < level[v]:\n                                    res[pos] = 0\n                                else:\n                                    res[pos] = 1\n                    break\n            elif (u == b):\n                v = a\n                if level[v] == -1:\n                    level[v] = level[u] + 1\n                    parent[v] = u\n                    q.append(v)\n                    for idx_edge, (a_edge, b_edge, c_edge) in enumerate(edges):\n                        if (a_edge == u and b_edge == v) or (a_edge == v and b_edge == u):\n                            pos = idx_edge\n                            if res[pos] == 0:\n                                if level[u] < level[v]:\n                                    pass\n                            else:\n                                if level[u] < level[v]:\n                                    res[pos] = 0\n                                else:\n                                    res[pos] = 1\n                    break\n                    \n    for idx in range(m):\n        a, b, c = edges[idx]\n        if a == 1 or b == 1:\n            if a == 1:\n                res[idx] = 0\n            else:\n                res[idx] = 1\n                \n    for i in range(2, len(order)):\n        u = order[i-1]\n        v = order[i]\n        for idx, (a, b, c) in enumerate(edges):\n            if (a == u and b == v) or (a == v and b == u):\n                if res[idx] == 0:\n                    if level[u] == level[v]:\n                        res[idx] = 1\n                else:\n                    if level[u] == level[v]:\n                        res[idx] = 0\n                        \n    for idx in range(m):\n        print(res[idx])\n        \nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of vertices `n`, edges `m`, and the list of edges with their capacities.\n2. **Initial Setup**: An array `res` is initialized to store the direction for each edge (0 for `ai → bi`, 1 for `bi → ai`).\n3. **BFS Traversal**: Starting from the source vertex (vertex 1), BFS is used to assign levels (distances) to all vertices.
