A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n Each bottle has 'l' milliliters. They have k bottles -> total drink = k * l milliliters.\n For a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. But note: the toasts are for the entire group? Actually, the problem says:\n \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast. And they want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\n\n However, note: the example calculation:\n   Drink: 4*5 = 20 ml -> 20 / 3 (because there are 3 friends) is not exactly the way. Let me re-read:\n\n Actually, the example says: \n   \"Overall the friends have 4*5=20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20/3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n But wait: 20 ml divided by 3 friends? That doesn't sound right for making toasts. The problem states: \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for one toast.\n\n However, note: the requirement for one toast per friend is nl milliliters. But if we are making t toasts per friend, then the total drink needed is n * t * nl.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: \n   Total drink available: k*l\n   Each toast requires: nl milliliters per friend? Or does it mean that for one toast (one round) each friend gets nl?\n\n The problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" to make one toast.\n\n So for one toast, the entire group will consume n * nl milliliters.\n\n Similarly, for the lime: they have c limes, each cut into d slices -> total slices = c*d. Each toast requires one slice per friend? Actually, the requirement says: \"a slice of lime\" (for each toast, one per friend?).\n\n But note: the example says: \"The limes are enough for 10*8=80 toasts\". Then they say: \"However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6,80,100)/3 = 2\".\n\n This implies that one toast requires one slice per friend. So if we make t toasts, each friend uses t slices. Therefore, the total number of slices required is n*t.\n\n Similarly, salt: each toast requires np grams per friend? Then total salt required is n*t*np.\n\n But the example for salt: 100 grams, and np=1, so 100/1 = 100 toasts? That seems to be considering the entire group's requirement for one toast: 100 toasts would require 3*1 = 3 grams? Actually, no.\n\n Let me clarify from the example: \n   Input: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n\n   Drink: 4*5 = 20 ml. Each toast (for the entire group) requires 3*3 = 9 ml? Actually, no: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for one toast. So for one toast, the group uses 3 (n=3) * 3 (nl=3) = 9 ml? \n\n   But wait, the example calculation says: 20/3 = 6 toasts. Why 20/3? \n\n   Actually, let me read again: \"it is enough to make 20/3 = 6 toasts\". \n\n   This suggests that the drink constraint is calculated in terms of the entire group's drink for one toast: total drink needed for one toast is n * nl.\n\n   Then, the maximum number of toasts (for the entire group) based on drink is floor( (k*l) / (n * nl) )? But then 20/(3*3)=20/9≈2.22 -> 2 toasts.\n\n   However, the example says 6. \n\n   Alternatively, if we consider that the drink is used per toast per friend, then the total toasts (for the entire group) is limited by the total drink divided by (nl * number_of_friends) per toast? That doesn't match.\n\n   Let me reexamine the example: \n        \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20/3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n   This suggests that the drink constraint is being considered independently for each toast (without multiplying by the number of friends). But wait, each toast requires one friend to have nl ml? Then one toast requires nl ml. However, the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for one toast. \n\n   This could be interpreted as: if we are making t toasts, then each friend must have t * nl ml. But then the total drink required is n * t * nl.\n\n   However, the example does: 20/3 = 6. So 20 ml is divided by 3 (nl) and gives 6.66... which is rounded down? But they took 6? Actually, 20/3 is approximately 6.666, but the example says 6.\n\n   Wait, the example says: \"min(6,80,100)\" -> so the drink gives 6, limes give 80, salt gives 100.\n\n   How did they get 6 from the drink?\n        Total drink: 20 ml.\n        Each toast requires 3 ml? (nl=3) but wait, the example says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters\", so for one toast, each friend needs 3 ml. Then one toast requires 3 ml * 3 friends = 9 ml. Then 20/9 is about 2.22 -> 2 toasts.\n\n   But the example says 6 toasts.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might be defining a toast as requiring nl milliliters per friend, but then the entire group's consumption for one toast is n * nl. Then the total number of toasts (for the entire group) is (total_drink) // (n * nl). Then 20 // 9 = 2.\n\n   However, note the example output is 2, and the calculation they did was min(6,80,100)/3 = 2.\n\n   Now, let's break down their calculation:\n\n        Drink: 20 ml -> 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Why 3? Because nl=3. But wait, if one toast requires 3 ml (for one friend), then for one toast we need 3 ml? But then why did they use 3 (nl) without multiplying by the number of friends?\n\n   This is confusing. Let me read the problem statement again: \n        \"To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\n   This means that for one toast, the requirements are:\n        - For each friend: nl milliliters of drink.\n        - For each friend: one slice of lime.\n        - For each friend: np grams of salt.\n\n   But wait, then what is the total requirement for one toast?\n        - Drink: n * nl\n        - Lime: n * 1 (since one slice per friend) -> but wait, they have c limes, each cut into d slices -> total slices = c*d. And for one toast, we need n slices (one per friend). So the number of toasts we can make from the limes is (c*d) // n? \n\n   Alternatively, the problem might be that one toast is defined as one serving for the entire group? Actually, no: the problem says \"each friend needs ...\", meaning per friend.\n\n   But then, if we are making t toasts, then each friend must have t * nl ml, t slices, and t * np grams of salt.\n\n   However, the example calculation:\n\n        Drink: 20 ml -> 20 / (nl * n) = 20 / (3*3) = 20/9 ≈ 2.22 -> 2 toasts (if we take the floor) for the entire group? Then each friend would have 2 toasts.\n\n        But the example says: min(6,80,100)/3 = 2.\n\n   Now, how did they get 6 from drink? \n        They did: 20 / 3 (nl) = 6.66... -> 6.\n\n   This suggests that the drink constraint is being calculated as: total_drink // nl, and then that is the total number of toasts (for the entire group? or per friend?) \n\n   But wait, if one toast requires one friend to have nl ml, then the entire group requires n * nl per toast. However, the example does:\n\n        Drink: 20 // 3 = 6 (but wait, 20//3 is 6.66... -> integer division would be 6, but then 6 toasts for the entire group? Then each friend would have 6 toasts? \n\n   But then the lime: \n        Total slices = 10*8 = 80 slices. For 6 toasts, we need 6 * 3 = 18 slices? But wait, the example says the limes are enough for 80 toasts. \n\n   Alternatively, the example's calculation for the drink is: total_drink // nl, which gives 20//3 = 6 (toasts) but then they divide by 3 (the number of friends) to get the number per friend? \n\n   Actually, the example says: \n        \"However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2\"\n\n   So they are taking the minimum of the three constraints (each expressed in some unit) and then dividing by the number of friends.\n\n   What are the three constraints?\n        Drink: 20 / 3 = 6 -> but wait, this 6 is the total number of toasts (for the entire group) that the drink can support? Because 20 ml, and each toast requires 3 ml (for one friend)? But then for one toast, how much drink is needed? \n\n   Let me define:\n        Let T be the total number of toasts (for the entire group) we can make. Then:\n            Drink required: T * (nl) * n   ??? (because each toast, each friend gets nl, so n friends * nl per toast)\n\n   But the example calculation for drink: 20 / 3 = 6. This 6 is not matching with the above.\n\n   Another interpretation: \n        The drink constraint is: (k*l) // (nl * n)   -> because each toast requires n * nl ml.\n\n   Then for the example: 20 // (3*3) = 20 // 9 = 2.\n\n   Similarly, the lime constraint: \n        Total slices = c*d = 80.\n        Each toast requires n slices (because each of the n friends gets one slice). \n        So the total toasts (for the entire group) that the limes can support is (c*d) // n = 80 // 3 = 26.\n\n   But wait, the example says the limes are enough for 80 toasts. \n\n   Alternatively, if we consider that the lime slices are used per toast per friend, then the total number of toasts (each toast being one round for the entire group) is limited by the total slices divided by the number of friends? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"each friend needs a slice of lime\" for one toast. So one toast requires n slices. Therefore, the maximum number of toasts (for the entire group) is (c*d) // n.\n\n   Then the drink constraint is (k*l) // (n*nl) and the lime constraint is (c*d) // n, and the salt constraint is p // (n*np) [because each toast requires n*np grams of salt].\n\n   Then the total toasts for the entire group is the minimum of these three.\n\n   Then the number of toasts per friend is: (min_value) // n? \n\n   But wait, the example: \n        n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n        Drink: (4*5) // (3*3) = 20 // 9 = 2\n        Lime: (10*8) // 3 = 80 // 3 = 26\n        Salt: (100) // (3*1) = 100 // 3 = 33\n\n        Then the limiting factor is 2. Then the number of toasts each friend can make is 2? \n\n   But the example output is 2, and the example says: min(6,80,100)/3 = 2.\n\n   How do they get 6,80,100?\n\n   Let me recalc with their method:\n\n        Drink: 20 / 3 = 6.66... -> 6 (if we take floor after division? But 20//3 in integer division is 6, but then they use 6 for the entire group's toasts? Then each friend would have 6 toasts? \n\n   Alternatively, maybe they are calculating the maximum number of toasts per friend as:\n\n        Drink: (k*l) // (nl * n) = 20 // 9 = 2 -> then that is the total toasts for the entire group, so per friend: 2.\n\n   But the example says: min(6,80,100)/3 = 2.\n\n   What if they are calculating the constraints per friend?\n\n        For drink: (k*l) // (nl * n) is the total toasts for the entire group, so per friend: (k*l) // (nl * n * n) ? That doesn't fit.\n\n   Another possibility: \n\n        The example calculates:\n\n            Drink: total_drink / (nl)   -> 20 / 3 = 6.66 -> then the number of toasts per friend? But wait, if each friend needs nl per toast, then the drink per friend is limited by (k*l) / (nl * n) [for the entire group] and then per friend: (k*l) / (nl * n) is the total toasts, and then we don't divide by n again? \n\n   Actually, let me see the example's explanation:\n\n        \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20/3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n   This 6 is the total toasts for the entire group? Then they say: \"However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6,80,100)/3 = 2\"\n\n   So they are saying: the drink can make 6 toasts (meaning for the entire group, 6 toasts). But wait, if one toast requires 3 ml for each of 3 friends (total 9 ml), then 20 ml can only make 2 full rounds (each round being 3 toasts? because 9 ml per round) -> 20//9 = 2. \n\n   But they say 6. \n\n   Let me check the example input: \n        Input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\n   They say: \n        Drink: 4*5=20 -> 20/3=6 toasts.\n\n   Why 3? Because nl=3. So they are doing: total_drink / nl = 20/3 = 6.66 -> 6 toasts.\n\n   Then, how many toasts per friend? Since there are 3 friends, and 6 toasts (for the entire group) then each friend makes 6/3 = 2 toasts.\n\n   But wait, if one toast is defined as one serving for the entire group (so one toast involves all friends having one sip?), then that would be different.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might be: \n        Each toast is defined as giving one friend one portion (nl ml, one slice, np grams). Then the entire group's toast count is the total number of portions (each portion is one toast for one friend). Then:\n\n        Drink: (k*l) // nl   -> 20 // 3 = 6\n        Lime: (c*d) // 1    -> 80 // 1 = 80   [because each toast (portion) requires one slice, and we have 80 slices]\n        Salt: p // np       -> 100 // 1 = 100\n\n        Then the limiting factor is 6.\n\n        Then, since there are n friends, the number of toasts each friend can make is 6 // 3 = 2.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   So the interpretation is:\n\n        A toast is defined as one drink portion (nl ml) for one friend. Then the entire event is made up of individual toasts (each toast is one friend having one portion).\n\n        Then the constraints are:\n\n            Drink: total_ml = k*l -> number of toasts (individual) from drink: total_ml // nl\n            Lime: total_slices = c*d -> number of toasts (individual) from lime: total_slices // 1   (since each toast requires one slice)\n            Salt: total_salt = p -> number of toasts (individual) from salt: total_salt // np\n\n        Then the total number of individual toasts we can make is the minimum of these three.\n\n        Then, since each friend can make the same number of toasts, we must divide the total individual toasts by the number of friends (n). But note: we cannot exceed the total toasts, and each friend must have the same number.\n\n        However, if we have T total toasts, then each friend can have at most T // n toasts (because we distribute the toasts equally). \n\n        Example: T=6, n=3 -> 6//3 = 2.\n\n        But what if T is not divisible by n? Then we take floor(T/n). However, the problem says \"as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount\". So we can't have fractional toasts.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Read the input: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np\n\n        total_drink = k * l\n        total_slices = c * d\n\n        constraint_drink = total_drink // nl   # because each toast (for one friend) requires nl ml\n        constraint_lime = total_slices // 1      # because each toast (for one friend) requires one slice\n        constraint_salt = p // np                # because each toast (for one friend) requires np grams\n\n        total_toasts = min(constraint_drink, constraint_lime, constraint_salt)\n\n        Then, since each friend must have the same number, and the total toasts is distributed equally, we do:\n\n        toasts_per_friend = total_toasts // n\n\n   However, wait: the example second sample:\n\n        Input: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\n        n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3\n\n        total_drink = 1000\n        constraint_drink = 1000 // 4 = 250\n\n        total_slices = 1*19 = 19\n        constraint_lime = 19 // 1 = 19\n\n        constraint_salt = 90 // 3 = 30\n\n        total_toasts = 19\n\n        toasts_per_friend = 19 // 5 = 3 (since 19//5 is 3 with remainder 4)\n\n        Output: 3 -> matches the example.\n\n   Third sample:\n\n        Input: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\n        n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1\n\n        total_drink = 1000*1000 = 1000000\n        constraint_drink = 1000000 // 50 = 20000\n\n        total_slices = 25*23 = 575\n        constraint_lime = 575\n\n        constraint_salt = 1 // 1 = 1\n\n        total_toasts = 1\n        toasts_per_friend = 1 // 10 = 0\n\n        Output: 0 -> matches.\n\n   Therefore, the solution:\n\n        Read the 8 integers.\n\n        n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\n        total_drink = k * l\n        total_slices = c * d\n\n        # Calculate the maximum number of individual toasts (each toast is one friend having one portion)\n        # For drink: each toast requires nl ml -> so total_drink // nl\n        # For lime: each toast requires 1 slice -> total_slices // 1\n        # For salt: each toast requires np grams -> p // np\n\n        # But note: the problem says \"each friend needs ...\", so each toast (which is one friend) uses nl, one slice, np.\n\n        constraint_drink = total_drink // nl\n        constraint_lime = total_slices  # because we use one slice per toast, so the number of toasts is just the number of slices (each toast uses one slice)\n        constraint_salt = p // np\n\n        total_toasts = min(constraint_drink, constraint_lime, constraint_salt)\n\n        # Now, each friend must have the same number of toasts. The total toasts is for the entire group, but each friend can have at most total_toasts // n (since we distribute equally)\n        toasts_per_friend = total_toasts // n\n\n        Print(toasts_per_friend)\n\n   However, wait: the lime constraint is calculated as total_slices, but note: each toast requires one slice. But the problem says \"a slice of lime\" for each toast. And one toast is for one friend. So yes, each toast uses one slice.\n\n   But note: the total_slices is the total available, so the maximum toasts is indeed total_slices (because each toast uses one slice). However, if we have 10 slices, we can have 10 toasts (each toast uses one slice).\n\n   But wait, the example first sample: \n        constraint_lime = 80, which is 10*8 -> that's correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"each friend needs a slice\", meaning per toast per friend. So if we have 10 slices, we can serve 10 toasts (each toast to one friend). But if we have 10 slices and 3 friends, then we can only serve 10//3 = 3 full rounds (each round, each friend gets a slice) but wait, no: the toast is defined as one friend having one portion. So the 10 slices can be used for 10 individual toasts (each toast is one friend). Then we distribute the 10 toasts among 3 friends: 10//3 = 3 toasts per friend (with 1 friend getting 4? but the problem says they must all drink the same amount). \n\n   However, the problem says: \"provided they all drink the same amount\". So we cannot have one friend having more toasts than another. Therefore, we must take the total_toasts (which is the minimum of the three constraints) and then divide by n (using integer division) to get the number of toasts per friend.\n\n   But note: the total_toasts is the total number of toasts (each toast is one friend). Then if we have T total toasts, we can assign T // n toasts to each friend (and the remaining T % n toasts are not used because we cannot break the toasts and we must keep equal).\n\n   Therefore, the code:\n\n        n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\n        # Calculate the three constraints for the total number of individual toasts (each toast is one friend)\n        drink_constraint = (k * l) // nl\n        lime_constraint = (c * d)  # because each toast uses one slice, so we can have up to (c*d) toasts\n        salt_constraint = p // np\n\n        total_individual_toasts = min(drink_constraint, lime_constraint, salt_constraint)\n\n        # Now, each friend must have the same number, so we divide the total_individual_toasts by n (using integer division)\n        result = total_individual_toasts // n\n\n        print(result)\n\n   Let's test with the examples:\n\n   Example 1: \n        n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1\n        drink_constraint = (4*5)//3 = 20//3 = 6 (since 20//3 is 6 in integer division)\n        lime_constraint = 10*8 = 80\n        salt_constraint = 100//1 = 100\n        total_individual_toasts = 6\n        result = 6 // 3 = 2 -> correct.\n\n   Example 2: \n        n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3\n        drink_constraint = 1000//4 = 250\n        lime_constraint = 19\n        salt_constraint = 90//3 = 30\n        total_individual_toasts = 19\n        result = 19 // 5 = 3 -> correct.\n\n   Example 3: \n        n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1\n        drink_constraint = 1000000//50 = 20000\n        lime_constraint = 25*23 = 575\n        salt_constraint = 1//1 = 1\n        total_individual_toasts = 1\n        result = 1 // 10 = 0 -> correct.\n\n   However, note: in the first example, the drink constraint is 6, but the actual total drink is 20 ml, and each toast requires 3 ml (for one friend). Then 6 toasts (each for one friend) would require 6 * 3 = 18 ml, which is within 20. But wait, why didn't we use the entire drink? \n\n   The issue is: the drink constraint is computed by (k*l)//nl, which is 20//3=6. But 6*3=18, so there's 2 ml left. That's okay.\n\n   But note: the lime constraint is 80, which is more than 6, and salt is 100, so 6 is the limiting factor.\n\n   This approach is correct.\n\n   However, note: the constraints are independent and we are using integer division (floor). This is acceptable because we cannot use fractions of a toast.\n\n   Code:\n\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data:\n            # In case of empty input, but the problem says positive integers, so we assume one line with 8 numbers.\n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n\n        n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, data)\n\n        drink_constraint = (k * l) // nl\n        lime_constraint = c * d\n        salt_constraint = p // np\n\n        total_toasts = min(drink_constraint, lime_constraint, salt_constraint)\n\n        result = total_toasts // n\n\n        print(result)\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink, lime slices, and salt per friend. The goal is to ensure that all friends consume the same number of toasts without exceeding the available resources.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts based on three constraints: drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires:\n   - `nl` milliliters of drink per friend.\n   - One lime slice per friend.\n   - `np` grams of salt per friend.\n   \n2. **Key Insight**: The total number of toasts is limited by the most restrictive resource. We calculate the maximum possible toasts for each resource separately and then take the minimum of these values. Since each friend must have the same number of toasts, we divide the total number of toasts by the number of friends (using integer division).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Drink Constraint**: Total drink available is `k * l`. Each toast requires `nl` milliliters per friend, so the maximum toasts from drink is `(k * l) // nl`.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: Total lime slices available is `c * d`. Each toast requires one slice per friend, so the maximum toasts from lime is `c * d`.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: Total salt available is `p`. Each toast requires `np` grams per friend, so the maximum toasts from salt is `p // np`.\n   \n   The actual maximum toasts is the minimum of these three values. The number of toasts each friend can make is this value divided by the number of friends (`n`), using integer division.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    drink_constraint = (k * l) // nl\n    lime_constraint = c * d\n    salt_constraint = p // np\n    \n    total_toasts = min(drink_constraint, lime_constraint, salt_constraint)\n    \n    result = total_toasts // n\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends (`n`), bottles of drink (`k`), milliliters per bottle (`l`), limes (`c`), slices per lime (`d`), grams of salt (`p`), milliliters per toast (`nl`), and grams of salt per toast (`np`).\n\n2. **Calculating Constraints**:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: The total drink available is `k * l`. Each toast requires `nl` milliliters per friend, so the maximum toasts from drink is `(k * l) // nl`.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: The total lime slices available is `c * d`. Each toast requires one slice per friend, so the maximum toasts from lime is simply `c * d`.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: The total salt available is `p`. Each toast requires `np` grams per friend, so the maximum toasts from salt is `p // np`.\n\n3. **Determining Total Toasts**: The actual maximum number of toasts is the smallest value among the three constraints calculated above.\n\n4. **Result Calculation**: The number of toasts each friend can make is the total toasts divided by the number of friends, using integer division to ensure all friends have the same number of toasts without exceeding any resource constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all resource limitations and ensures an equitable distribution of toasts among friends.",
