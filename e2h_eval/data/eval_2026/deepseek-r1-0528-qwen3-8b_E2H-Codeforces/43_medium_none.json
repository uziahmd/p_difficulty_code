He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed that the string only contains 'a','b','c'\n Conditions:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and note that C appends some number of 'c' (which is either the count of 'a' OR the count of 'b' OR both) but note: \n    - However, note the process: \n        - A gives a string of some 'a's.\n        - Then B appends some 'b's (so the string has an initial segment of 'a's and then a contiguous segment of 'b's? But note: what if there are no 'b's from B? But condition says at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist -> so there must be at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Also, the process requires that B appends some number (at least one) of 'b's.\n\n 2. Then C appends 'c's, and the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' (or both). \n\n However, note: the example \"aabc\" is \"YES\". Let's break down:\n\n Conditions on the string:\n   - The string must be split into three parts: \n        [some 'a's] (from A)\n        [some 'b's] (from B, at least one)\n        [some 'c's] (from C, with count = (# of 'a') or (# of 'b'))\n\n But note: the problem does not require that the entire string is divided by just these three letters in order. However, the process implies:\n   - First, only 'a's (from A)\n   - Then, only 'b's (from B, appended to the end of the 'a's)\n   - Then, only 'c's (from C, appended to the end)\n\n So the string should be non-decreasing in the sense: first all 'a's, then all 'b's, then all 'c's? Actually, the problem says:\n   - A has a string of 'a's -> so the first part is all 'a's.\n   - Then B appends some 'b's -> so after the 'a's we have 'b's, and no mixing because they are appended at the end.\n   - Then C appends some 'c's -> so after the 'b's we have 'c's.\n\n Therefore, the string must have the form: \n   [a]*[b]*[c]*\n But note: what if there are no 'b's? Then the condition fails because the problem states that after A gives the string to B, B appends some 'b's (so at least one). Similarly, the problem says at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n\n However, wait: the problem says \"they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist\", meaning after B's appending. Then C appends some 'c's. So the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and then possibly some 'c's.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check that the string is composed in non-decreasing order (i.e., no 'b' before an 'a', no 'c' before an 'a' or 'b').\n\n    Actually, the string must be in the form: \n        S = (some 'a's) + (some 'b's) + (some 'c's)\n\n    But note: it is possible that the string doesn't have any 'c'? Then the condition for C is that he appends some number of 'c' (which could be zero? But note: the problem says \"C appends some number\", and the number is either the count of 'a' or the count of 'b' at that time (after B). However, the problem states: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\" \n\n    The string at the time C appends: \n        Count of 'a' is the original A's string (all the 'a's in the final string)\n        Count of 'b' is the number of 'b's that B appended.\n\n    Since C appends a number of 'c's, that number must be either the count of 'a' (which is the total 'a's) or the count of 'b' (which is the number of 'b's) at the moment just before appending.\n\n    However, note: the problem does not say that the entire string must have the three letters. It says that the string is built by:\n        Start with a string of 'a's (at least one)\n        Then append at least one 'b'\n        Then append a number of 'c's which is either the total 'a' (which is the initial count) or the total 'b' (which is the appended count) or both.\n\n    But note: the condition says \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\". \n\n    At the moment when C is about to append, the string has:\n        count_a = number of 'a's (from A)\n        count_b = number of 'b's (from B)\n\n    Then C appends k 'c's, where k must be either count_a or count_b.\n\n    However, the problem does not require that the entire string has three distinct letters. For example, if there are no 'c's, then k=0. But then k must equal the count of 'a' or the count of 'b'. So if the string is \"ab\", then k=0, but then we require 0 == 1 (count_a) or 0==1 (count_b) -> fails. So \"ab\" is not allowed.\n\n    But wait: the example input includes ['aaabccc'] -> YES, ['bbacc'] -> NO, ['aabc'] -> YES.\n\n    Let me check the examples:\n\n    Example 1: \"aaabccc\"\n        Count_a = 3, Count_b = 1, Count_c = 3 -> which is equal to Count_a (3) -> valid.\n\n    Example 2: \"bbacc\"\n        This string is \"bbacc\": \n            It has two 'b's at the beginning, then an 'a' -> that breaks the order. So even if we try to break the string, we cannot have the form [a]*[b]*[c]* because here we see 'a' after 'b'. So order is broken.\n\n    Example 3: \"aabc\"\n        Count_a = 2, Count_b = 1, Count_c = 1 -> which is equal to Count_b (1) -> valid.\n\n    But wait: the example \"aabc\" is given as \"YES\". However, note the process: \n        A gives a string of 'a's: so initially we have at least one 'a'. Then B appends some 'b's. Then C appends some 'c's.\n\n    In \"aabc\": \n        The first two characters are 'a' and then 'a'? Actually, the string is \"aabc\": \n            It starts with two 'a's, then one 'b', then one 'c'. \n\n        So the breakdown: \n            A gives \"aa\" (two 'a's)\n            B appends one 'b' -> so now the string is \"aab\"\n            Then C appends one 'c' -> because the count of 'b' is 1, and 1 is either the count of 'a' (which is 2) or the count of 'b' (which is 1) -> so yes, it matches the condition for the count (using the count of 'b').\n\n    However, note: the condition says \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' in the string\". \n\n    At the moment when C appends, the string is \"aab\", so:\n        count_a = 2, count_b = 1.\n        He appends 1 'c', which is equal to count_b (1). So valid.\n\n    Now, what if the string is \"aaa\"? \n        But wait, after A gives the string (which is \"aaa\") and then B must append at least one 'b'. So \"aaa\" alone is not allowed because there's no 'b'. Similarly, \"aaa\" would break the condition that there is at least one 'b'.\n\n    Another example: \"abbcc\"\n        Count_a = 1, Count_b = 2, Count_c = 2 -> valid because Count_c equals Count_b (2).\n\n    But also: \"abbccc\" -> \n        Count_a = 1, Count_b = 2, Count_c = 3 -> 3 != 1 and 3 != 2 -> invalid.\n\n    However, what if the string is \"aabbcc\"? \n        Count_a = 2, Count_b = 2, Count_c = 2 -> valid because 2 equals Count_a and also equals Count_b.\n\n    But note the order: the string must be in the form [a]*[b]*[c]*.\n\n    Steps for solution:\n\n    1. Check the order: the string should be non-decreasing in the sense that once we leave the 'a' region (i.e., we see a 'b'), then we cannot see an 'a' again. Similarly, once we leave the 'b' region (i.e., we see a 'c'), then we cannot see an 'a' or 'b' again.\n\n    2. We can traverse the string and check that:\n        - The first character is 'a' (because A gives a string of 'a's) -> but actually, what if the string starts with 'b'? Then it's invalid. Similarly, if we see a 'c' without having seen an 'a' and a 'b' (in order) then it's invalid.\n\n    Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Let n = len(S)\n\n        We can try to split the string into three segments: \n            Segment1: 'a'* (at least one 'a')\n            Segment2: 'b'* (at least one 'b')\n            Segment3: 'c'* (can be zero? But note: the problem says C appends some number, which might be zero? However, the problem says \"appends some number\", and the condition is that the number of 'c' is either the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. So if the number of 'c' is zero, then we require 0 == count_a or 0 == count_b. But note: the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b', so count_a>=1 and count_b>=1, so 0 is not equal to either. Therefore, the number of 'c' must be at least 1? Actually, no: the condition for C is that the number of 'c' is set to the count of 'a' or 'b'. So if the count of 'a' is 0, then we cannot use that, but we know there is at least one 'a'. Similarly, the count of 'b' is at least one. So the minimal number of 'c' is 1 (if we choose the minimum between the two counts, but actually we choose one of the two). \n\n        However, note: the problem does not say that C must append at least one 'c'. It says \"appends some number\", which in English can include zero? But the condition is tied to the existing counts. Since the existing counts (of 'a' and 'b') are positive, and the appended 'c' must be one of them, then the appended 'c' must be at least 1.\n\n        Therefore, we require at least one 'c'? Actually, no: the condition says the number of 'c' must be the count of 'a' or the count of 'b'. Since the counts are positive, then the number of 'c' must be at least 1. So the string must end with at least one 'c'.\n\n        But wait: what if the string has no 'c'? Then the condition fails because the number of 'c' is 0, and 0 is not equal to the positive count of 'a' or 'b'. So we must have at least one 'c'.\n\n    However, let me re-read the problem: \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\" The word \"some\" typically means at least one, but in programming problems sometimes \"some\" can include zero. But note the condition: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. If we append zero, then we require 0 == count_a or 0 == count_b. But count_a and count_b are at least 1 (because the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'). So zero is not allowed.\n\n    Therefore, the string must have at least one 'c'. \n\n    Algorithm:\n\n    Step 1: Check the entire string has only 'a','b','c' (given) and that it is non-empty.\n\n    Step 2: Verify the order: the string should be such that:\n        - All the 'a's come first, then all the 'b's, then all the 'c's.\n\n        How to check: \n            Traverse until we find a character different from 'a'. Then we should not see 'a' again.\n            Then traverse until we find a character different from 'b'. Then we should not see 'b' again.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n            Let i = 0\n            While i < n and s[i]=='a': i++\n            Then from i to the end, if we see an 'a', then invalid.\n\n            Then while i < n and s[i]=='b': i++\n            Then from i to the end, if we see a 'b', then invalid.\n\n            Then the rest must be 'c's.\n\n        But note: what if the string has no 'b'? Then we never get to the 'b' part. But we know the string must have at least one 'b'. Similarly, the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n\n    Step 3: Count the numbers:\n        count_a = number of 'a'\n        count_b = number of 'b'\n        count_c = number of 'c'\n\n        Condition: count_c must be either count_a or count_b.\n\n    However, wait: the counts in the condition for C are taken from the string BEFORE appending the 'c's. \n\n    Important: The condition says \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\". \n\n    The string at the time C appends is the string after B, i.e., without the 'c's. So the counts of 'a' and 'b' are fixed (the entire string without the appended 'c's). \n\n    But note: the entire string we are given is the final string. However, the condition uses the counts at the time of appending. \n\n    Let me denote:\n        Let x = count_a (which is the same as the entire string's count_a, because A only provided 'a's and then B and C didn't add any 'a')\n        Let y = count_b (same as the entire string's count_b, because B only provided 'b's and C didn't add any 'b')\n\n        Then the condition for the number of 'c's is: \n            count_c_appended = count_c (the entire string's count_c) must equal x or y.\n\n        BUT: note that the condition says \"in the string\", meaning the string that exists at the moment C appends. That string is the one without the 'c's. So the counts of 'a' and 'b' in the string at that moment are the same as the entire string's counts because the 'c's are appended at the end and don't change the counts of 'a' and 'b'. \n\n        Therefore, the condition is simply: \n            count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b\n\n    However, there is a catch: what if the string is not in the form [a]*[b]*[c]*? Then we cannot use the entire string's counts because the process did not happen. \n\n    So the plan:\n\n        1. Check the order: the string must be in the form [a]*[b]*[c]* (with at least one 'a', one 'b', and the rest 'c's, and note that the 'c's must be at least one because the condition for C requires the count to be positive and matching the existing counts).\n\n        2. Then check that the number of 'c' is either the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'.\n\n    But note: the condition also requires that the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So we must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n\n    However, what if the string is \"abc\"? \n        Order: yes, [a][b][c]\n        Counts: a=1, b=1, c=1 -> then 1==1 (for a) and 1==1 (for b) -> valid.\n\n    What if the string is \"aaccc\"? \n        This is not in the form [a]*[b]*[c]* because we have an 'a' then an 'a' then a 'c'? Actually, the order is okay: \n            It starts with two 'a's, then one 'c'. But wait, according to the process, after the 'a's we must have at least one 'b'. Here there is no 'b'. So invalid.\n\n    So the steps:\n\n        Step 1: Check the order. We can do:\n\n            found_b = False\n            found_c = False\n\n            for char in S:\n                if char == 'a':\n                    # we should not see 'a' after we've seen a non-'a'?\n                    if not found_b and not found_c:\n                        continue\n                    else:\n                        # we have already seen a non-'a' and now we see an 'a' -> invalid\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        exit(0)\n                elif char == 'b':\n                    found_b = True\n                    if found_c:\n                        # we have already seen a 'c', so now we see a 'b' -> invalid\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        exit(0)\n                else: # char == 'c'\n                    found_c = True\n\n        But wait, this is a simpler way: we traverse and mark when we switch from 'a' to 'b' and then to 'c'. We cannot go back.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            if 'b' in S and 'c' in S:\n                # Check that the first occurrence of 'b' and then 'c' is in increasing order and no going back.\n\n            We can do:\n\n            indices = [index for index, char in enumerate(S) if char != 'a']\n            Then the first non-'a' must be 'b', then the next non-'a' must be 'c', and once we see a non-'a' we don't see 'a' again.\n\n        Or:\n\n            We can split the string by 'a','b','c' but that's overkill.\n\n        Another method:\n\n            We can do:\n\n            i = 0\n            n = len(S)\n\n            # Count the consecutive 'a's\n            while i < n and S[i]=='a':\n                i += 1\n\n            # Then consecutive 'b's\n            while i < n and S[i]=='b':\n                i += 1\n\n            # Then consecutive 'c's\n            while i < n and S[i]=='c':\n                i += 1\n\n            If we reached the end and i==n, then the order is correct.\n\n        Then we must also ensure that:\n            - There is at least one 'a' (we broke the first loop at least once, so the first loop ran at least one step? Actually, the first loop runs until a non-'a' is found, but if the string is empty? No, because |S|>=1.\n\n        But note: the problem says the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So we must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n\n        So after the above loops, we must have:\n\n            count_a = (the length of the first segment)\n            count_b = (the length of the second segment) and must be >=1\n            count_c = (the length of the third segment) and must be >=1 (since the condition for C requires the count to be positive and match the existing counts, and the existing counts of 'a' and 'b' are positive, so the appended 'c' must be positive)\n\n        Then check that count_c is either count_a or count_b.\n\n    However, wait: what if the string is \"aabbcc\" (valid) but what if the string is \"aabbccc\" (then count_c=3, which is not equal to count_a=2 nor count_b=2 -> invalid). \n\n    But note: the condition is about the counts of 'a' and 'b' at the time of appending. In the entire string, the counts of 'a' and 'b' are fixed (and they are 2 and 2). So the condition is 3==2 or 3==2 -> false.\n\n    So we must have the entire string's counts: \n        count_a = total 'a's (from the first segment)\n        count_b = total 'b's (from the second segment)\n        count_c = total 'c's (from the third segment)\n\n    And then check: count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\n    But wait, what if the string is \"aaaabbbccc\" (with counts a=4, b=3, c=3). Then condition: 3==4 or 3==3 -> true.\n\n    However, note: the condition for C is that the number of 'c' is the count of 'a' OR the count of 'b'. In this case, the count of 'b' is 3, so it matches.\n\n    But note: the string must be split into three contiguous segments. \n\n    However, there is an alternative: what if the string has no 'c'? Then our last loop would break at i<n and then we don't have a third segment. Then we would not have processed the entire string? \n\n    We must check that the entire string is processed.\n\n    So:\n\n        Steps:\n\n        1. Read the string S.\n\n        2. Check that the string is in the form [a]*[b]*[c]* by:\n\n            i = 0\n            n = len(S)\n\n            # Read all 'a's\n            while i < n and S[i]=='a':\n                i += 1\n\n            # Read all 'b's\n            while i < n and S[i]=='b':\n                i += 1\n\n            # Read all 'c's\n            while i < n and S[i]=='c':\n                i += 1\n\n            If i != n, then the string has other characters -> invalid, so \"NO\".\n\n        3. Now, we must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' and at least one 'c'? \n\n            Actually, the problem says:\n                - A gives at least one 'a'\n                - B appends at least one 'b'\n                - C appends some number (but the condition requires that the number is positive because the counts of 'a' and 'b' are positive, so the number of 'c' must be positive, i.e., at least one).\n\n            So we must have:\n                count_a = (length of first segment) >= 1\n                count_b = (length of second segment) >= 1\n                count_c = (length of third segment) >= 1\n\n            But note: what if the string is \"ab\"? Then the third segment is empty (i becomes n, so we break) but then we don't have any 'c'. Then the condition for the count: we require the number of 'c' (which is 0) to be either the count of 'a' (1) or the count of 'b' (1) -> fails. So we must have at least one 'c'. \n\n            However, our loop would break at the second segment (since there are no 'c's) and then we check i==n? Yes, because we break the second loop at the last character (which is 'b') and then we break the third loop (no more characters). But then we haven't read the entire string? Actually, we have: the string \"ab\" is read by:\n\n                First loop: reads 'a' (i=1)\n                Second loop: reads 'b' (i=2) -> then third loop: i=2, so condition fails.\n\n            Then we check: i==n? n=2, so i==2 -> we have read the entire string. But then we must check the counts:\n\n            count_a = 1, count_b = 1, count_c = 0.\n\n            Condition: count_c must be 1 or 1 -> 0 is not. So we output \"NO\".\n\n        4. Now, if the string is in the form [a]*[b]*[c]*, we then check:\n\n            count_a = (number of 'a') \n            count_b = (number of 'b')\n            count_c = (number of 'c')\n\n            if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    But wait: what if the string is \"aabbcc\" (count_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=2) -> valid.\n\n    However, consider the example \"aabc\": \n        S = \"aabc\"\n\n        Step 2: \n            First loop: reads two 'a's -> i=2\n            Second loop: reads one 'b' -> i=3\n            Third loop: reads one 'c' -> i=4, which is the end.\n\n            Then count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1 -> 1==2? no, 1==1? yes -> YES.\n\n    But note: the example \"aaabccc\": \n        First loop: reads three 'a's -> i=3\n        Second loop: reads one 'b' -> i=4\n        Third loop: reads three 'c's -> i=7 (if the string length is 7)\n\n        Then count_a=3, count_b=1, count_c=3 -> 3==3 or 3==1 -> true.\n\n    However, what if the string is \"abc\"? \n        First loop: one 'a' -> i=1\n        Second loop: one 'b' -> i=2\n        Third loop: one 'c' -> i=3 -> done.\n\n        Counts: a=1, b=1, c=1 -> 1==1 -> YES.\n\n    But what if the string is \"abb\"? \n        First loop: one 'a' -> i=1\n        Second loop: two 'b's -> i=3\n        Third loop: nothing -> i=3, so we have read the entire string.\n\n        Now, condition: count_c=0 -> 0==1 (count_a) or 0==2 (count_b) -> false -> NO.\n\n    But wait: the problem says that after B appends, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends some number of 'c's. So the string must have the 'c's appended. Therefore, the string \"abb\" is not valid because C did not append any 'c'. \n\n    However, the problem says: \"C appends some number of letters 'c'\", meaning at least one? Actually, the condition for the number of 'c' is tied to the counts of 'a' and 'b'. Since the counts of 'a' and 'b' are positive, the appended 'c' must be positive (one of the positive counts). Therefore, the string must have at least one 'c'.\n\n    So our method is:\n\n        Step 1: Check the entire string is in the form [a]*[b]*[c]* (by the three loops) and that we read the entire string.\n\n        Step 2: Check that the counts of 'a' (first segment) is at least 1, counts of 'b' (second segment) is at least 1, and counts of 'c' (third segment) is at least 1.\n\n        Actually, the problem requires at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from A and B), and then C appends so the 'c' part must be present (and the condition forces the count to be positive). So we can rely on the third segment being non-empty? Not exactly: the condition for the count is separate. But note: the third segment must be non-empty because the condition for the count of 'c' must be positive (since the counts of 'a' and 'b' are positive, and the appended 'c' must be one of them, so positive). \n\n        However, if the third segment is empty, then the condition fails (as in \"abb\"). \n\n        But our three-loop method already ensures that we break the string into three parts. The third part can be empty. Then we must check that the third part is non-empty? \n\n        Alternatively, we can combine:\n\n        After the three loops, if the third segment is empty (i.e., we broke at the second segment and the third loop did not run) then the entire string is processed (so i==n) but the third segment is empty. Then we must check the condition for the count: the count of 'c' is 0, which is invalid. So we can do:\n\n            if i != n:\n                return \"NO\"\n\n            Then, if the second segment was empty (i.e., we never entered the second loop) then we have no 'b', which is invalid.\n\n            Similarly, if the first segment was empty (we never entered the first loop) then we have no 'a', invalid.\n\n        Actually, we must ensure:\n\n            count_a = (first segment length) >= 1\n            count_b = (second segment length) >= 1\n            count_c = (third segment length) >= 1\n\n        But note: the three loops:\n\n            We start by reading 'a's. Then 'b's. Then 'c's.\n\n            The first segment: if the string is empty, then we don't enter the first loop, but the problem says |S|>=1.\n\n            Example: \"b\" -> then first loop: doesn't run (i=0, then we break) -> then second loop: runs? but the first character is 'b'. Then we read the 'b', then third loop: nothing. Then we have read the entire string (i=1, n=1). Then we check:\n\n                count_a = 0 -> invalid.\n\n        So we must check that the first segment is non-empty and the second segment is non-empty and the third segment is non-empty.\n\n        Actually, the problem requires at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from A and B) and then C appends at least one 'c'. So:\n\n            Condition 1: The string must be split into three non-empty contiguous segments: [a]* (non-empty), [b]* (non-empty), [c]* (non-empty).\n\n        Then, the condition 2: the number of 'c' (the third segment) must be equal to the number of 'a' (first segment) or the number of 'b' (second segment).\n\n    Therefore, we can do:\n\n        Read S.\n\n        Let i = 0, n = len(S)\n\n        # Read a's\n        seg_a = []\n        while i < n and S[i]=='a':\n            seg_a.append(S[i])\n            i += 1\n\n        # Read b's\n        seg_b = []\n        while i < n and S[i]=='b':\n            seg_b.append(S[i])\n            i += 1\n\n        # Read c's\n        seg_c = []\n        while i < n and S[i]=='c':\n            seg_c.append(S[i])\n            i += 1\n\n        if i != n or len(seg_a)==0 or len(seg_b)==0 or len(seg_c)==0:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        Then, count_a = len(seg_a), count_b = len(seg_b), count_c = len(seg_c)\n\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n    However, wait: what if the string is \"aaabbbccc\" (all three segments non-empty) but the condition holds?\n\n        count_a = 3, count_b=3, count_c=3 -> YES.\n\n    But what if the string is \"aaabbbcccccc\" (count_a=3, count_b=3, count_c=6) -> NO.\n\n    But note: the condition is that the number of 'c's appended is either the count of 'a' (3) or the count of 'b' (3). Here 6 != 3 and 6 != 3 -> NO.\n\n    However, consider the example: \"aabbcc\" (a=2, b=2, c=2) -> YES.\n\n    But wait: there is a possibility: what if the string is \"aaaabbbccc\" (a=4, b=3, c=3) -> then the condition is 3==4 or 3==3 -> YES.\n\n    Another example: \"aaaabbbcccc\" (a=4, b=3, c=4) -> 4==4 (a) -> YES.\n\n    But wait: what if the string is \"aaaabbbccc\" and we have a=4, b=3, c=3 -> valid.\n\n    However, what if the string is \"aaaabbbccc\" but the condition is that the number of 'c' is either the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b'. Here, the number of 'c' is 3, and the number of 'b' is 3 -> valid.\n\n    But note: the condition is defined at the time of appending. The time of appending: the string is \"aaaabbb\", so the count of 'a' is 4, count of 'b' is 3. Then C appends 3 'c's (which is the count of 'b'). \n\n    This matches.\n\n    However, there is a catch: what if the string is \"aaaabbbccc\" but the condition is satisfied by the count of 'a'? Then we would require the number of 'c' to be 4, but here it is 3. But the condition is OR: so if one of them holds, it's valid.\n\n    But wait: the condition is that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b'. So if the number of 'c' is 3, and the number of 'b' is 3, then it is valid.\n\n    However, what if the string is \"aaaabbbccc\" and we have a=4, b=3, c=3 -> valid.\n\n    But what if the string is \"aaaabbbccc\" and we have a=4, b=3, c=4? Then the condition is 4==4 (a) -> valid.\n\n    But note: the entire string must be in the form [a]*[b]*[c]*. \n\n    However, there is a different issue: what if the string is \"aaaabbbccc\" but the condition for the order is broken? No, because we are splitting by contiguous segments.\n\n    But what if the string is \"aaaabbbccc\" but the counts are: \n        a:4, b:3, c:3 -> valid.\n\n    Another example: \"aaabbbccc\" (a=3, b=3, c=3) -> valid.\n\n    Example: \"aaabbbcccc\" (a=3, b=3, c=4) -> invalid.\n\n    But wait: what if the string is \"aaabbbccc\" (a=3, b=3, c=3) is valid, but what if the string is \"aaabbbcc\" (a=3, b=3, c=2) -> invalid.\n\n    However, there is an alternative: the condition says the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b'. \n\n    But note: the problem says that C appends the 'c's. The entire string is built by:\n\n        Original A: \"aaa\" (if a=3)\n        Then B appends \"bbb\" -> so the string becomes \"aaabbb\"\n        Then C appends either 3 (if he chooses the count of 'a') or 3 (if he chooses the count of 'b') -> so he appends 3 'c's.\n\n    So the string must have exactly 3 'c's. \n\n    Therefore, the code:\n\n        Read S.\n\n        # Split into three contiguous segments: a's, then b's, then c's.\n\n        i = 0\n        n = len(S)\n\n        # Count the consecutive a's\n        a_count = 0\n        while i < n and S[i]=='a':\n            a_count += 1\n            i += 1\n\n        b_count = 0\n        while i < n and S[i]=='b':\n            b_count += 1\n            i += 1\n\n        c_count = 0\n        while i < n and S[i]=='c':\n            c_count += 1\n            i += 1\n\n        # If we did not traverse the whole string, or if any segment is missing (especially the first two must have at least one) then NO.\n        if i",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by the specific process described. The process involves three steps: starting with a string of 'a's, appending some 'b's, and then appending some 'c's such that the number of 'c's is either equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string before appending the 'c's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check String Structure**: The string must be in the form where all 'a's come first, followed by all 'b's, and then all 'c's. This means the string should not have any 'a's after 'b's or any 'b's or 'c's before 'a's.\n2. **Validate Segments**: Ensure there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c' in the string. The absence of any of these segments makes the string invalid.\n3. **Check Count Condition**: The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string. This condition ensures that the 'c's were appended according to the specified rules.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    S = input().strip()\n    n = len(S)\n    i = 0\n\n    a_count = 0\n    while i < n and S[i] == 'a':\n        a_count += 1\n        i += 1\n\n    b_count = 0\n    while i < n and S[i] == 'b':\n        b_count += 1\n        i += 1\n\n    c_count = 0\n    while i < n and S[i] == 'c':\n        c_count += 1\n        i += 1\n\n    if i != n or a_count == 0 or b_count == 0 or c_count == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read from standard input.\n2. **Segment Identification**: The code processes the string in three parts:\n   - **'a' Segment**: Counts consecutive 'a's at the beginning of the string.\n   - **'b' Segment**: Counts consecutive 'b's following the 'a's.\n   - **'c' Segment**: Counts consecutive 'c's following the 'b's.\n3. **Validation Checks**: \n   - The entire string must be processed (i.e., no characters left unparsed).\n   - Each segment ('a', 'b', 'c') must have at least one character.\n4. **Count Condition Check**: The number of 'c's must match either the count of 'a's or 'b's. If this condition is met, the output is \"YES\"; otherwise, it's \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the structural and numerical conditions required for the string to be valid according to the problem's specifications.",
