And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read the first line to get n and k.\n Then, read the next line which has n integers.\n\n There are (n - k + 1) weeks. Each week is k consecutive days.\n\n We need to compute the average sleep time over all weeks.\n\n However, note that the total sum of sleep over all weeks is not simply the same as:\n   total = (a1 + a2 + ... + an) * (k-1) / something? \n But wait, actually we can use a sliding window.\n\n Let S be the total sum for one week (the first week: days 0 to k-1). Then the next week is from day1 to dayk, etc.\n\n The total sum for all weeks is:\n   week0: [0, k-1] -> sum0\n   week1: [1, k]   -> sum0 - a0 + a[k]\n   week2: [2, k+1] -> sum0 - a0 + a[k] - a[1] + a[k+1]\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute a prefix sum array to quickly compute the sum for any contiguous segment.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read n, k and the list of sleep times.\n 2. Precompute prefix sums: \n        prefix[i] = a0 + a1 + ... + a{i-1}\n    Then the sum for days l to r is prefix[r+1] - prefix[l].\n\n 3. For each week i (from 0 to n-k), the week covers days i to i+k-1.\n    So the sum for week i is: prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n 4. Then the total sum of all weeks is the sum of these (n-k+1) values.\n\n 5. The average is total_sum / (n - k + 1)\n\n However, note: the example input \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\" gives 7 weeks.\n\n But wait, if we do:\n\n   total_weeks = 0\n   for i in range(0, n - k + 1):\n        total_weeks += (prefix[i+k] - prefix[i])\n\n But note: the above loop is O(n) and n can be up to 200000, which is acceptable.\n\n However, we can also use the fact that the entire array's contribution can be broken down by each element's frequency.\n\n Actually, the element at index j appears in how many weeks?\n   The first week that includes j is week starting at max(0, j - k + 1) and the last week that includes j is week ending at min(n-k, j) ? \n\n Alternatively, we can note that the element a[j] will appear in the first week that starts at max(0, j - k + 1) and then until the week that ends at j, i.e., the last week that includes j is when the week starts at j - k + 1? Actually, the week must end at j, so the week starts at j - k + 1 (if j - k + 1 >=0) but also the week must start at most at j (if j < n-k+1?).\n\n Actually, the week that starts at s (0<=s<=n-k) will include indices from s to s+k-1. Therefore, for element at index j (0-indexed), it is included in all weeks s such that:\n        s <= j <= s+k-1   =>   j - (k-1) <= s <= j\n\n And s must be between 0 and n-k (inclusive). So the number of weeks that include a[j] is:\n\n        L = max(0, j - k + 1)   [but wait, let me reframe: s must be at least 0 and at most n-k, and also s <= j and s >= j - k + 1]\n\n Actually, s must satisfy: s <= j and s >= j - k + 1, but also s>=0 and s<=n-k.\n\n So the count is: \n        low = max(0, j - k + 1)\n        high = min(j, n - k)   [because s cannot exceed n-k]\n\n Then the count is: min(j, n-k) - max(0, j-k+1) + 1   ??? Not exactly.\n\n Let me correct: the condition for s is: \n        s <= j and s >= j - k + 1, and s from 0 to n-k.\n\n So the valid s are from L = max(0, j-k+1) to R = min(j, n-k) [because s<=j and s<=n-k]. Then the count is R - L + 1, but only if R>=L, otherwise 0.\n\n However, note: j-k+1 might be negative, so we take max(0, j-k+1) as the lower bound.\n\n But wait, what if j-k+1 is negative? Then we set L=0.\n\n Example: j=0, then L = max(0,0-k+1)=max(0,-k+1)=0, and R = min(0, n-k). Since n>=k, n-k>=0, but if n-k=0 then R=0, else R=min(0, n-k)=0. Then count=0-0+1=1.\n\n Example: j=k-1, then L = max(0, (k-1)-k+1)=max(0,0)=0, R = min(k-1, n-k). Then count = min(k-1, n-k) - 0 + 1.\n\n But note: the element at index j is included in the week that starts at s from max(0, j-k+1) to min(j, n-k). However, note that the week must end at s+k-1, and we require that the week does not go beyond the array. Actually, the week must end at s+k-1 <= n-1, so s<=n-k. Also, the week must start at s>=0.\n\n So the count for a[j] is: \n        count_j = min(j, n-k) - max(0, j-k+1) + 1   [if min(j, n-k) >= max(0, j-k+1)]\n\n But wait, let me test with the example: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\n Then we have two weeks: [0,1] and [1,2].\n\n For j=0: count_0 = min(0, 3-2=1) - max(0,0-2+1)=max(0,-1)=0 -> 0 to 0? Then count_0 = 0-0+1 = 1. Correct, because 3 is in the first week.\n For j=1: count_1 = min(1,1) - max(0,1-2+1)=max(0,0)=0 -> 1-0+1 = 2. Correct, 4 is in both weeks.\n For j=2: count_2 = min(2,1) - max(0,2-2+1)=max(0,1)=1 -> 1-1+1 = 1. Correct, 7 is in the second week.\n\n Then total_sum = 3*1 + 4*2 + 7*1 = 3 + 8 + 7 = 18.\n\n Then average = 18 / 2 = 9.0 -> matches.\n\n However, note: the above method requires knowing the count for each element. Then total_sum = sum_{j=0}^{n-1} a[j] * count_j.\n\n Then average = total_sum / (n-k+1)\n\n This method is O(n) and avoids the nested loop.\n\n But note: the problem says n up to 200000, so both methods are O(n). However, the first method (using a loop over the weeks) is also O(n) because we are iterating n-k+1 times, which is about 200000.\n\n However, the second method (using counts) is also O(n). But the first method using prefix sums and then a loop over the weeks is straightforward.\n\n Let me code the first method:\n\n Steps for first method:\n\n   n, k = map(int, input().split())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   # Build prefix sum array of length n+1\n   prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n   for i in range(1, n+1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n   total_weeks = n - k + 1\n   total_sum = 0.0\n\n   # Iterate over each week (from start index 0 to n-k)\n   for i in range(0, n - k + 1):\n        # The week from i to i+k-1\n        total_sum += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n   average = total_sum / total_weeks\n\n   # Format the output to have 10 decimal places or until no more digits.\n\n But wait, the example: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7] -> total_weeks=2, total_sum = (prefix[2]-prefix[0]) + (prefix[3]-prefix[1])\n        prefix[0]=0, prefix[1]=3, prefix[2]=7, prefix[3]=14.\n        week0: 7-0 = 7\n        week1: 14-3 = 11\n        total_sum = 7+11 = 18, average=18/2=9.0 -> correct.\n\n However, note: the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n But wait, there is a better way: we can avoid the inner loop by using the counts method, which might be faster? Actually, both are O(n). But the counts method uses one pass, while the above uses two passes (one for prefix and one for the weeks) and the counts method uses one pass for the counts and then a pass to multiply and sum.\n\n But the problem constraints are up to 200000, so either is acceptable.\n\n However, the problem says: \"In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\"\n\n But note: the counts method might be simpler to understand.\n\n Alternatively, we can also use the counts method without building the prefix array.\n\n Let me write the counts method:\n\n   n, k = map(int, input().split())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   total_weeks = n - k + 1\n   total_sum = 0.0\n\n   for j in range(n):\n        # Count the number of weeks that include a[j]\n        low = max(0, j - k + 1)\n        high = min(j, n - k)   # because the week must start at most at n-k (so that the week ends at n-k + k - 1 = n-1, the last day)\n        # But wait, the condition for the week to include j is that the week starts s such that s <= j and s >= j-k+1, and s must be in [0, n-k].\n        # So the valid s are from low to high, but note: high should be the minimum of j and n-k, but also note that the week must start at most j (which is always true because j>=0 and n-k might be less than j) and the week must start at most n-k (so s<=n-k). Therefore, the upper bound is min(j, n-k) is correct.\n\n        # However, what if j is greater than n-k? Then we set high = n-k, because the week can only start at most n-k (so that the week ends at n-1). But wait, our condition above was: s<=j and s<=n-k. So the upper bound is the minimum of j and n-k.\n\n        # Now, if low <= high, then the count is (high - low + 1), else 0.\n\n        if low <= high:\n            count_j = high - low + 1\n        else:\n            count_j = 0\n\n        total_sum += a[j] * count_j\n\n   average = total_sum / total_weeks\n\n However, let's test with the example n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]:\n\n   j=0: low = max(0,0-2+1)=0, high = min(0, 3-2)=min(0,1)=0 -> count_j=1 -> 3*1=3.\n   j=1: low = max(0,1-2+1)=0, high = min(1,1)=1 -> count_j=2 -> 4*2=8.\n   j=2: low = max(0,2-2+1)=1, high = min(2,1)=1 -> count_j=1 -> 7*1=7.\n\n   total_sum = 3+8+7=18, average=18/2=9.0 -> correct.\n\n But wait, in the example the second week is [1,2] (index1 to index2). For j=2, the week that starts at s=1 (which is the second week) includes index2. So the count for j=2 is 1. Correct.\n\n However, note: the above counts method uses two conditions: s>=j-k+1 and s<=j, and s<=n-k. But the condition s<=j is redundant with the definition of the week? Actually, the week that starts at s must end at s+k-1, and we require that j<=s+k-1 -> s>=j-k+1, and j>=s (because the week starts at s and goes to s+k-1, so j must be at least s). But wait, j>=s is equivalent to s<=j. So the conditions are correct.\n\n However, note: the condition s<=n-k is necessary because the week must start at s and end at s+k-1, and s+k-1<=n-1 -> s<=n-k.\n\n But the above counts method works.\n\n But wait, consider j=0: condition s<=0 and s>=0, so only s=0. Correct.\n j=1: s<=1 and s>=0, and s<=n-k (which is 1) -> s from 0 to 1. Correct.\n j=2: s<=2 and s>=1, and s<=1 -> so s=1. Correct.\n\n However, note: the condition for j=2: s>=1 and s<=1, so s=1.\n\n But what if k=1? Then the condition for j=0: low = max(0,0-1+1)=0, high=min(0, n-1). If n=5, then high=min(0,4)=0 -> count=1. Correct, because the week of 1 day (only day0) is one week.\n\n What if k=3, n=5, j=2 (middle)? \n   Condition: s>=2-3+1=0, s<=2, and s<=5-3=2 -> s from 0 to 2. So count=3.\n\n But wait, the week must be 3 consecutive days. The week starting at s=0: [0,1,2] -> includes j=2.\n        s=1: [1,2,3] -> includes j=2.\n        s=2: [2,3,4] -> includes j=2.\n\n So indeed 3.\n\n However, note: the week starting at s must not extend beyond the array. Our condition s<=n-k ensures that the last day of the week is s+k-1 <= n-1.\n\n But wait, the condition for j=2: the week starting at s=0: ends at 2 (0+3-1=2) -> valid.\n        s=1: ends at 3 (valid)\n        s=2: ends at 4 (valid)\n\n So yes.\n\n But note: the condition for j=2: the week must start at s<=2 (which is given) and s>=0 (given). And we also require s<=n-k (which is 5-3=2). So we don't consider s=3 because 3>2 (and 3 would make the week [3,4,5] which is invalid since the array has only 5 elements, so index5 doesn't exist). So the condition is correct.\n\n However, note: the condition for j=2: we have s>=0 and s<=2, so 3 weeks. Correct.\n\n But wait, the total_weeks is n-k+1 = 5-3+1=3, so we have 3 weeks.\n\n But the counts method multiplies each element by the number of weeks that include it. Then we sum and divide by total_weeks.\n\n However, there is a catch: the above counts method is O(n) and we are doing a simple loop. \n\n But note: the problem constraints say n up to 200000, so both methods (prefix and counts) are acceptable.\n\n However, the prefix method we did earlier is two passes (building prefix and then the weeks loop) and the counts method is one pass (iterating j from 0 to n-1). But both are linear.\n\n But wait, the counts method does two operations per element (computing low and high) and then one multiplication and addition. The prefix method builds the prefix array (n+1 elements) and then a loop of n-k+1 steps.\n\n Since n-k+1 can be up to 200000, both are acceptable.\n\n However, the counts method might be slightly faster because it does one loop and the operations are simple.\n\n But note: the example input \"1 1\\n10\" -> n=1, k=1, a=[10]\n\n   total_weeks = 1\n   j=0: low = max(0,0-1+1)=0, high = min(0,0)=0 -> count=1, total_sum=10, average=10.0\n\n Another example: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n\n   total_weeks = 8-2+1=7\n\n   We'll compute the counts for each index:\n\n   j0: low = max(0,0-2+1)=0, high=min(0,6)=0 -> count=1\n   j1: low = max(0,1-2+1)=0, high=min(1,6)=1 -> count=2\n   j2: low = max(0,2-2+1)=1, high=min(2,6)=2 -> count=2\n   j3: low = max(0,3-2+1)=2, high=min(3,6)=3 -> count=2\n   j4: low = max(0,4-2+1)=3, high=min(4,6)=4 -> count=2\n   j5: low = max(0,5-2+1)=4, high=min(5,6)=5 -> count=2\n   j6: low = max(0,6-2+1)=5, high=min(6,6)=6 -> count=2\n   j7: low = max(0,7-2+1)=6, high=min(7,6)=6 -> count=1\n\n   Then total_sum = 1*1 + 2*2 + 4*2 + 100000*2 + 123*2 + 456*2 + 789*2 + 1*1\n        = 1 + 4 + 8 + 200000 + 246 + 912 + 1578 + 1\n        = 1 + 4 =5; 5+8=13; 13+200000=200013; 200013+246=200259; 200259+912=201171; 201171+1578=202749; 202749+1=202750.\n\n   Then average = 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n   Which matches the example output.\n\n However, wait: the example output is '28964.2857142857'\n\n But note: the example input was \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n\n So the counts method is correct.\n\n But wait, is the counts method really correct? Consider the week definitions:\n\n   Week0: [0,1] -> 1,2\n   Week1: [1,2] -> 2,4\n   Week2: [2,3] -> 4,100000\n   Week3: [3,4] -> 100000,123\n   Week4: [4,5] -> 123,456\n   Week5: [5,6] -> 456,789\n   Week6: [6,7] -> 789,1\n\n Now, the element 1 (at index0) is only in week0 -> count=1.\n        element2 (index1) is in week0 and week1 -> count=2.\n        element4 (index2) is in week1 and week2 -> count=2.\n        element100000 (index3) is in week2 and week3 -> count=2.\n        element123 (index4) is in week3 and week4 -> count=2.\n        element456 (index5) is in week4 and week5 -> count=2.\n        element789 (index6) is in week5 and week6 -> count=2.\n        element1 (index7) is only in week6 -> count=1.\n\n So the counts are: [1,2,2,2,2,2,2,1] -> correct.\n\n Therefore, we can choose either method.\n\n Let's code the counts method because it's one pass and we don't need to build a prefix array.\n\n However, note: the counts method requires that we know the total_weeks (n-k+1) and then we iterate.\n\n Code:\n\n   n, k = map(int, input().split())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   total_weeks = n - k + 1\n   total_sum = 0.0\n\n   for j in range(n):\n        low_bound = max(0, j - k + 1)\n        high_bound = min(j, n - k)   # because s (the start index) must be <= n-k (to not exceed the array) and <= j (since the week must start at or before j)\n\n        # But wait: the condition for the week to include j is that the week starts at s and s<=j and s>=j-k+1, and s<=n-k.\n        # Therefore, the valid s are from low_bound to high_bound (both inclusive). The number of integers from low_bound to high_bound is (high_bound - low_bound + 1) if high_bound>=low_bound, else 0.\n\n        if high_bound >= low_bound:\n            count_j = high_bound - low_bound + 1\n        else:\n            count_j = 0\n\n        total_sum += a[j] * count_j\n\n   average = total_sum / total_weeks\n\n   # Format the output to have 10 decimal places.\n\n But wait, note: the example \"8 2 ...\" gave 202750/7 = 28964.2857142857..., but let me compute 202750/7:\n\n        7 * 28964 = 202748, remainder 2, so 28964 + 2/7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n   So we output with 10 decimal places.\n\n How to format?\n\n   print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n But wait, what if the average is an integer? We want 9.0000000000.\n\n The formatting in Python with {:.10f} will do that.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6\", so 10 decimal places is more than enough.\n\n But note: the counts method is correct.\n\n However, let me check with the example n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7] again.\n\n   j0: low_bound = max(0,0-2+1)=0, high_bound = min(0,1)=0 -> count_j=1, add 3*1=3.\n   j1: low_bound = max(0,1-2+1)=0, high_bound = min(1,1)=1 -> count_j=2, add 4*2=8.\n   j2: low_bound = max(0,2-2+1)=1, high_bound = min(2,1)=1 -> count_j=1, add 7*1=7.\n\n   total_sum=3+8+7=18, average=18/2=9.0 -> formatted to 9.0000000000.\n\n One more edge: n=k, then total_weeks=1.\n\n   Example: n=2, k=2, a=[1,2]\n\n   j0: low_bound = max(0,0-2+1)=0, high_bound=min(0,0)=0 -> count_j=1 -> 1*1=1.\n   j1: low_bound = max(0,1-2+1)=0, high_bound=min(1,0)=0 -> wait, min(1,0)=0, so count_j=0? Then total_sum=1, average=1/1=1.0.\n\n   But the week is [0,1]: sum=1+2=3, so average=3/1=3.0.\n\n   Wait, what went wrong? \n\n   Let me recalc for j1: \n        Condition: s>=1-2+1=0, and s<=1, and s<=n-k=0. So s must be <=0 and >=0 -> s=0. \n        But the week that starts at 0 includes index1? Yes, because the week is [0,1] (k=2, so two days). So j1 is included in the week starting at s=0.\n\n        But our condition for j1: \n            low_bound = max(0,1-2+1)=max(0,0)=0\n            high_bound = min(1, 2-2)=min(1,0)=0.\n\n        Then count_j=1 (because 0 to 0 -> 1). \n\n        So why did I say 0? I think I miswrote: the condition for high_bound is min(j, n-k) -> n-k=0, so min(1,0)=0.\n\n        Then count_j = 0-0+1=1.\n\n   So the calculation for j1: 2*1=2, total_sum=1+2=3, average=3.0.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   Why did I think j1's high_bound was 0? Because n-k=0, and j=1, so min(1,0)=0.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   But wait, why did I write the condition as \"high_bound = min(j, n-k)\"? \n\n        Explanation: the week must start at s<=n-k (so that the week ends at s+k-1 <= n-1) and also s<=j (so that the week starts at or before j). Therefore, the upper bound for s is the minimum of j and n-k.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, note: if n-k is negative, but the problem states k<=n, so n-k>=0.\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n But wait, there's a slight issue: the condition for the week to include j is that the week starts at s and s<=j and s>=j-k+1, and s<=n-k. Therefore, the upper bound is min(j, n-k). But note: if j < n-k, then the upper bound is j. If j>=n-k, then the upper bound is n-k.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Code:\n\n   n, k = map(int, input().split())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   total_weeks = n - k + 1\n   total_sum = 0.0\n\n   for j in range(n):\n        low_bound = max(0, j - k + 1)\n        high_bound = min(j, n - k)   # because s must be <= j and <= n-k\n\n        if high_bound < low_bound:\n            count_j = 0\n        else:\n            count_j = high_bound - low_bound + 1\n\n        total_sum += a[j] * count_j\n\n   average = total_sum / total_weeks\n\n   print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n But wait, what if the problem is large? This is O(n) and n=200000, so it's acceptable.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"It's been almost a week\", and the constraints are up to 200000, so we must ensure efficiency.\n\n This code is efficient.\n\n Let me run the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\"\n Example 2: \"1 1\\n10\"\n Example 3: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n\n We already verified these.\n\n But wait, the example \"8 2 ...\" has n=8, k=2, so total_weeks=7, and we computed total_sum=202750, average=202750/7=28964.2857142857.\n\n However, note: the example output is \"28964.2857142857\", so we must output 10 decimal digits.\n\n Formatting: {:.10f} will output 10 digits after the decimal.\n\n But note: floating point precision. The numbers can be as large as 200000 * 10^5 (each a[i] up to 10^5, and each a[i] can be counted up to (n-k+1) which is 200000, so maximum total_sum is 200000 * 10^5 * 200000 = 2e15, which is within the range of float (which has about 15-16 digits of precision). But wait, 2e15 is 2 followed by 15 zeros, which is 16-digit integer. However, when we divide by total_weeks (up to 200000) we get a float that might have rounding issues.\n\n But the problem says the absolute or relative error must be <= 1e-6, so even if we use double (which Python uses) we are safe.\n\n However, to be safe, we can use the decimal module? But the problem doesn't require that. The constraints are such that the total_sum is an integer (because a[j] are integers and count_j is integer) and total_weeks is integer, so the average is a rational number. But we are doing floating point division.\n\n Alternatively, we can use integer arithmetic and then convert to float for formatting? But the problem allows absolute or relative error 1e-6, and floating point division for integers this big should be exact? \n\n Wait, total_weeks is at most 200000, and total_sum is the sum of integers multiplied by integers, so total_sum is an integer. Then we are dividing two integers: total_sum / total_weeks.\n\n But note: in Python, if we use integers, and then convert to float, we might lose precision for very large numbers (like 2e15) because float has 53 bits of precision, which is about 15-16 decimal digits. 2e15 is 16-digit number, so the quotient (which is 2e15 / 200000 = 1e10, which is 10-digit integer part and then fractional part) might be represented exactly? \n\n However, the quotient might not be an integer. But note: the numerator (total_sum) is an integer and the denominator (total_weeks) is an integer. The representation in base-2 might not be exact for some fractions. But the problem requires 10 decimal digits and error <=1e-6.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   average = total_sum / total_weeks\n\n But if we use integer division, we would lose the fractional part.\n\n We are using floating point, which is acceptable.\n\n However, to avoid any floating point precision issues for very large numbers, we can use:\n\n   average = total_sum / total_weeks   # but total_sum and total_weeks are integers\n\n But note: in Python, if we use integers, and then divide, if the numbers are too big, the division might be inexact. However, the total_weeks is at most 200000, and total_sum is at most 200000 * 10^5 * (n-k+1) -> worst-case n=200000, k=1, then total_weeks=200000, and each a[i] is 10^5, and each a[i] appears in (min(i, 199999) - max(0, i-0) + 1) ... actually, when k=1, then for j, low_bound = max(0, j-1+1)=max(0,j), and high_bound = min(j, 199999). So for j from 0 to 199999, the count for j is min(j, 199999) - max(0,j) + 1. But wait, for k=1:\n\n   low_bound = max(0, j-1+1)=max(0,j)\n   high_bound = min(j, 200000-1)=min(j,199999)\n\n   Then for j=0: low_bound=0, high_bound=0 -> count=1.\n        j=1: low_bound=1, high_bound=1 -> count=1.\n        j=2: low_bound=2, high_bound=2 -> count=1.\n        ... every j has count=1.\n\n   Then total_sum = 10^5 * 200000 = 20000000000 (20 billion)\n\n   Then average = 20000000000 / 200000 = 100000.0 -> exact.\n\n   But if k is 2, then the counts vary, but the maximum total_sum is still bounded by 200000 * 10^5 * 200000? Actually, no: each a[j] is counted at most (n-k+1) times? Actually, the maximum count for an element is n-k+1 (when the element is in the middle). So worst-case total_sum is (n-k+1) * (sum(a)).\n\n   The sum(a) is at most 200000 * 10^5 = 2e10, and n-k+1 is at most 200000, so total_sum is at most 2e10 * 200000 = 4e15, which is 4 followed by 15 zeros.\n\n   Then average = 4e15 / 200000 = 2e10, which is an integer, but not necessarily.\n\n   But wait, the counts are integers and a[j] are integers, so total_sum is integer. And total_weeks is integer. Then the average is a rational number.\n\n   However, the floating point representation might not be able to represent all 10 decimal digits exactly if the number is too large? \n\n   But the requirement is only 10 decimal digits with error 1e-6. The floating point for numbers around 1e10 has about 10 significant digits, but we are formatting to 10 decimal places. \n\n   Actually, the issue is that 4e15 is a 16-digit integer, and when we",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time of Polycarp over all possible weeks in a given sequence of sleep records. A week is defined as k consecutive days, and there are (n - k + 1) such weeks in the sequence. The challenge is to efficiently compute the sum of sleep times for each week and then find the average.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires calculating the average sleep time over all possible weeks (each consisting of k consecutive days) in a sequence of n days. The key insight is recognizing that each day's sleep time contributes to multiple weeks, specifically those weeks that include that day. \n\n2. **Intuition**: For each day `j` in the sequence, determine how many weeks include it. This can be done by calculating the range of starting indices of weeks that include day `j`. The starting index `s` must satisfy `s <= j` and `s >= j - k + 1`, and also `s` must be within the valid range `[0, n - k]`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Count Calculation**: For each day `j`, compute the number of weeks that include it using the formula `count_j = max(0, min(j, n - k) - max(0, j - k + 1) + 1)`. This gives the count of valid starting indices for weeks that include day `j`.\n   - **Summation**: Multiply each day's sleep time by its count and sum these products to get the total sleep time across all weeks.\n   - **Average Calculation**: Divide the total sleep time by the number of weeks (n - k + 1) to get the average.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach involves a single pass through the sequence to compute counts and another pass to sum the products, resulting in an O(n) time complexity, which is optimal for the given constraints (n ≤ 2·10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    total_sum = 0.0\n    \n    for j in range(n):\n        low_bound = max(0, j - k + 1)\n        high_bound = min(j, n - k)\n        \n        if high_bound < low_bound:\n            count_j = 0\n        else:\n            count_j = high_bound - low_bound + 1\n            \n        total_sum += a[j] * count_j\n        \n    average = total_sum / total_weeks\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes two integers (n and k) followed by a list of n integers representing daily sleep times.\n2. **Initialization**: The total number of weeks is calculated as `n - k + 1`. The variable `total_sum` is initialized to accumulate the sum of sleep times across all weeks.\n3. **Count Calculation**: For each day `j`, the code determines the range of week starting indices that include day `j` using `low_bound` and `high_bound`. The count of such weeks is derived from these bounds.\n4. **Summation**: Each day's sleep time is multiplied by its count and added to `total_sum`.\n5. **Average Calculation**: The average sleep time is computed by dividing `total_sum` by the number of weeks. The result is formatted to 10 decimal places for precision.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average by leveraging the observation that each day's contribution can be determined independently, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
