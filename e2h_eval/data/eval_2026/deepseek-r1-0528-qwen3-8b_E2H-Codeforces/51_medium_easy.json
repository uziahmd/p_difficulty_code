Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from standard input.\n The idea is:\n 1. Combine the first two strings (guest name and host name) and count the total frequency of each letter.\n 2. Compare the frequency of letters in the third string (the pile) with the combined frequency of the first two.\n 3. If the two frequencies match exactly, then we output \"YES\", otherwise \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the problem says that there should be no extra letters and no missing letters.\n\n Steps:\n - Read the three lines and strip any newline characters.\n - Concatenate the first two strings to form the target string.\n - Count the frequency of each character in the target string and in the third string.\n - If the counts for every letter in the target string are the same as in the pile (and no other letters in the pile), then it's \"YES\". But note: the pile must not have any letter not present in the target? Actually, if the pile has an extra letter (even if it's one that is in the target but more than needed) then it's NO.\n\n So, we can do:\n   from collections import Counter\n\n   s1 = first line (guest)\n   s2 = second line (host)\n   s3 = third line (pile)\n\n   combined = s1 + s2\n   c_combined = Counter(combined)\n\n   c_pile = Counter(s3)\n\n   Then, check if c_combined == c_pile.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   combined = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n   pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   We need to count the letters.\n\n But note: the example input is given as a list of strings in the example, but the actual input is three separate lines.\n\n However, the example input format is:\n\n   ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...] \n\n But wait, that's a list of three strings. Actually, the sample input has three lines.\n\n Let me clarify: the input is three lines.\n\n Example input from standard input:\n\n   SANTACLAUS\n   DEDMOROZ\n   SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n So, we read:\n\n   line1 = input().strip()\n   line2 = input().strip()\n   line3 = input().strip()\n\n But note: the problem says the input file consists of three lines.\n\n Alternatively, we can read:\n\n   data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n   guest = data[0].strip()\n   host = data[1].strip()\n   pile = data[2].strip()\n\n Let's use the second method to handle multiple lines.\n\n However, the problem states that the input file has three lines. We'll read three lines.\n\n Steps:\n\n   import sys\n   from collections import Counter\n\n   data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n   if len(data) < 3: \n        # According to the problem, there are three lines, but just in case.\n        # But we assume three lines.\n\n   guest = data[0].strip()\n   host = data[1].strip()\n   pile = data[2].strip()\n\n   combined = guest + host\n   c_combined = Counter(combined)\n   c_pile = Counter(pile)\n\n   if c_combined == c_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n   else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n But wait: what if the pile has extra letters? Then the Counter will have more counts for some letters or different letters, so the condition fails. Similarly, if the pile is missing a letter, then the combined counter has a letter that the pile doesn't have, or has less count.\n\n Example 2: \n   Input: \n        PAPAINOEL\n        JOULUPUKKI\n        JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n   Here, the expected output is \"NO\".\n\n   Let's break down the second example:\n\n   Guest: \"PAPAINOEL\"\n   Host: \"JOULUPUKKI\"\n\n   Combined: \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n\n   Now, the pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n   Let's count the letters in the combined and the pile:\n\n   Combined: \n        P: 3 (from PAPA) + 1 (from JOULUPUKKI) -> actually, let me count:\n\n        P: 3 (PAPAINOEL: P appears 3 times? PAPA has 2 P's and then the last word has one? Actually, let's write:\n\n        PAPAINOEL: \n            P:2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1? Wait, let me spell: \n            P-A-P-A-I-N-O-E-L -> P:2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1.\n\n        JOULUPUKKI:\n            J:1, O:1, U:2, L:1, P:1, U: already counted? Actually, we have to count all:\n\n        Combined: \n            P: 2 (from guest) + 1 (from host) = 3\n            A: 2 (guest) + 0 = 2\n            I: 1 (guest) + 0 = 1\n            N: 1 (guest) + 0 = 1\n            O: 1 (guest) + 1 (host) = 2\n            E: 1 (guest) + 0 = 1\n            L: 1 (guest) + 1 (host) = 2\n            J: 0 + 1 = 1\n            U: 0 + 2 = 2\n            K: 0 + 2 = 2\n\n        Now the pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        Let me break down the pile: \n            J:1, O:2, U:3, L:2, N:1, A:2, P:2, I:1, E:1, K:2\n\n        So, the counts don't match: \n            Combined: \n                P:3, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:2, E:1, L:2, J:1, U:2, K:2\n            Pile: \n                P:2 -> which is less than 3.\n\n        Therefore, the condition fails.\n\n Example 3: \n   Input: \n        BABBONATALE\n        FATHERCHRISTMAS\n        BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n   Expected: \"NO\"\n\n   Let's check: \n        Guest: \"BABBONATALE\" \n        Host: \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n\n        Combined: \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n\n        Now, the pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        We can count the letters.\n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the example says there's an extra letter 'L'. So the pile has an extra 'L' that is not accounted for.\n\n        In the combined, how many L's?\n            Guest: \"BABBONATALE\" -> L:1\n            Host: \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\" -> L:1 (in CHRISTMAS)\n            So combined: 2 L's.\n\n        In the pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n            There are two L's? Actually, let's look: \n                ...BONATALLE... -> there are two L's in \"TALLE\", so two L's? \n            But wait, the example says there's an extra letter 'L'. \n\n        Actually, the example says: \"there's an extra letter 'L'\", meaning the pile has one more L than the combined.\n\n        So, combined: 2 L's, pile: 3 L's? \n\n        Let me recount the pile: \n            The pile string: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n            Break down the pile: \n                BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n            We see \"TALLE\": that's T, A, L, L, E -> two L's.\n\n            And in the guest and host, we have only two L's. But wait, the guest \"BABBONATALE\" has one L at the end, and the host \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\" has one L in \"CHRISTMAS\". So total two.\n\n            Now, the pile: \n                How many L's?\n                - In \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\":\n                    \"BAB\": no L.\n                    \"CHRISTMAS\": one L.\n                    \"BONATALLE\": two L's (because of \"TALLE\")\n                    \"FATHER\": no L.\n\n            So total L's in the pile: 1 (from CHRISTMAS) + 2 (from TALLE) = 3.\n\n        Therefore, the pile has 3 L's, while the combined needs only 2. So the condition fails.\n\n        But wait, the example output is \"NO\", which matches.\n\n However, note: the example input provided in the problem is:\n\n   ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n This representation is confusing because the example input is given as a list of three strings, each containing the three lines. Actually, the problem says the input file has three lines.\n\n Since the problem says the input file has three lines, we can assume that we get three lines.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll use:\n\n   import sys\n\n   lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n   if len(lines) < 3:\n        # But the problem says three lines, so we assume there are three.\n        # We can take the first three lines.\n        # However, the problem states three lines, so we assume three.\n        pass\n\n   guest = lines[0].strip()\n   host = lines[1].strip()\n   pile = lines[2].strip()\n\n   from collections import Counter\n   total_letters = guest + host\n   total_counter = Counter(total_letters)\n   pile_counter = Counter(pile)\n\n   if total_counter == pile_counter:\n        print(\"YES\")\n   else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n   guest = \"SANTACLAUS\"\n   host = \"DEDMOROZ\"\n   pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   total_letters = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n   Count the letters in total_letters and in pile.\n\n   Alternatively, we can run a small test:\n\n   total_letters = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n   pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Let's count the length: \n        len(total_letters) = 14 (SANTACLAUS: 10, DEDMOROZ: 8 -> 10+8=18? Wait, let me count:\n\n        SANTACLAUS: S A N T A C L A U S -> 10 letters.\n        DEDMOROZ: D E D M O R O Z -> 8 letters. Total 18.\n\n        pile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S -> 16 letters? \n\n   Wait, that doesn't match. \n\n   But wait, the example input was given as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n   Actually, the example input is three lines, but the example string is provided in a way that the first two lines are \"SANTACLAUS\" and \"DEDMOROZ\", and the third line is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\".\n\n   So, the total_letters should be 10 + 8 = 18, but the pile is 16? That would mean the example input doesn't match.\n\n   Let me re-read the example:\n\n        Input:\n          SANTACLAUS\n          DEDMOROZ\n          SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n        Output: YES\n\n   But the example provided in the problem statement is:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   This seems to be a representation of three test cases. But the problem says the input file consists of three lines.\n\n   Actually, the problem says: the input file consists of three lines. So we are reading three lines.\n\n   In the first sample, the three lines are:\n\n        Line1: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        Line2: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        Line3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Then the combined string is \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\", which has 18 letters.\n\n   The pile string is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", which has 16 letters.\n\n   Then the counts won't match.\n\n   There's a discrepancy. \n\n   Let me check the example again from the problem statement:\n\n        Input:\n          SANTACLAUS\n          DEDMOROZ\n          SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n        Output: YES\n\n   This implies that the pile should be the combination of the guest and host, i.e., the letters from both names.\n\n   But wait, the example input for the pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", which is 16 letters.\n\n   The total letters required is 18. \n\n   Alternatively, maybe the example intended to have the pile as the combination of both names? \n\n   Let me compare:\n\n        Guest: SANTACLAUS -> letters: S, A, N, T, C, L, U -> wait, let me list without duplicates? No, we need frequency.\n\n        Guest: SANTACLAUS: \n            S:2, A:2, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n        Host: DEDMOROZ: \n            D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n        Combined: \n            S:2, A:2, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1 -> total 2+2+1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+2+1+1 = 17? \n\n        Wait, let me count the letters in \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\":\n\n            S:2 (first and last of guest) + none in host -> 2\n            A:2 (positions 2 and 7) + none -> 2\n            N:1 + none -> 1\n            T:1 + none -> 1\n            C:1 + none -> 1\n            L:1 + none -> 1\n            U:1 + none -> 1\n            D:2 (host) -> 2\n            E:1 (host) -> 1\n            M:1 (host) -> 1\n            O:2 (host) -> 2\n            R:1 (host) -> 1\n            Z:1 (host) -> 1\n\n        Now the pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        Let me break down the pile:\n\n            S: appears at the beginning and the end -> 2\n            A: appears twice? \n            N: appears once?\n            T: appears once?\n            M: appears once? (in MOROZ part) -> yes\n            O: appears twice? (in MOROZ and then in DEDMOROZ? Actually, the pile string: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n            Let me write: \n                S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S\n\n            Counting:\n\n            S: 2\n            A: 3 (positions 2,5,15)\n            N: 1\n            T: 1\n            M: 1\n            O: 2 (positions 7 and 8)\n            R: 1\n            Z: 1\n            D: 2 (positions 10 and 11)\n            E: 1\n            C: 1\n            L: 1\n            U: 1\n\n            So the pile has: \n                A:3, but the combined requires 2.\n\n            This does not match.\n\n        But wait, the example output is \"YES\". \n\n        There must be a mistake in the example representation.\n\n        Let me check the example input from the problem statement again:\n\n            ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n        This is a single string with three lines? Or is it three separate strings?\n\n        The problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n        So the actual input is:\n\n            Line1: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n            Line2: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n            Line3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        But then the example output is \"YES\", meaning the pile must have exactly the letters of the combined.\n\n        Alternatively, maybe the example intended the pile to be \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" (the combined string) but written without spaces? \n\n        But the example input for the pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", which is 16 letters, while the combined is 18.\n\n        There's a possibility that the example input has been provided incorrectly.\n\n        Let me check the example from the problem statement's example input: \n\n            The example input is given as:\n\n                ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n            This is a list of three strings, but each string is the entire input for one test case? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then provides an example input. \n\n        The example input is:\n\n            ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n        This means there are three test cases, each being three lines. But our program reads one test case (three lines). \n\n        Wait, the problem does not specify multiple test cases. It says the input file consists of three lines.\n\n        So, we assume one test case.\n\n        But the example input is given as a list of three strings, each string containing the three lines of one test case.\n\n        This is confusing. \n\n        Clarification: the problem says \"The input file consists of three lines\". So the input file for one test case has three lines.\n\n        The example input provided in the problem is three test cases, but the problem does not say that there are multiple test cases.\n\n        However, the example output is ['YES','NO','NO'].\n\n        So, the example input is actually three test cases? \n\n        But the problem says the input file has three lines. So maybe the input file has three lines per test case? \n\n        Actually, reading the problem statement again: \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n        And the example input is given as a list of three strings, each string being three lines (with newline characters).\n\n        This suggests that the example input is three separate test cases, each test case having three lines.\n\n        But the problem statement does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n        However, looking at the example input representation, it is likely that the problem expects multiple test cases.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\", meaning one test case.\n\n        So, the example input provided in the problem is just one test case? \n\n        Let me reexamine: \n\n            Example input: \n                ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n            This is a list of three strings, but each string is a concatenation of three lines (with newlines). \n\n        Actually, the problem's example input is:\n\n            SANTACLAUS\n            DEDMOROZ\n            SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n        And then another test case:\n\n            PAPAINOEL\n            JOULUPUKKI\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        And the third:\n\n            BABBONATALE\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        So, the input file actually contains three test cases? \n\n        But the problem says the input file has three lines. \n\n        There's a contradiction.\n\n        Let me read the problem statement again: \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n        This suggests one test case. \n\n        However, the example input is shown as a list of three strings, each being three lines. \n\n        After checking the sample outputs: ['YES','NO','NO'].\n\n        The problem might be designed to have multiple test cases? Or maybe the example input is given in a compact form.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then gives an example input and output.\n\n        The example input is:\n\n            ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n        This is not the typical input format for a competitive programming problem. Usually, we get one test case.\n\n        But the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n        So, we must assume one test case.\n\n        However, the example input is provided as three separate test cases. \n\n        This is a problem. \n\n        But wait, the example output is a list of three strings: ['YES','NO','NO'].\n\n        So, perhaps the problem actually has multiple test cases? \n\n        Let me check the constraints: \"The length of each line does not exceed 100.\"\n\n        And the problem does not specify the number of test cases.\n\n        After re‐reading: the problem does not specify the number of test cases. \n\n        But the input description says: three lines.\n\n        This is ambiguous.\n\n        However, looking at the example input format, it is given as a list of three strings, each string containing three lines (with newline separators). \n\n        Actually, the example input is represented as a list of three strings, but each string is the entire input for one test case? \n\n        And then the output is a list of three strings.\n\n        So, we are expected to process multiple test cases? \n\n        But the problem says \"The input file consists of three lines\", which would be one test case.\n\n        There seems to be a misunderstanding.\n\n        Let me look at the problem statement in the user's message: \n\n            \"The input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning.\"\n\n        So, one test case.\n\n        But the example input is provided as three test cases. \n\n        This is confusing.\n\n        Since the problem statement is ambiguous, but the example output is three answers, we must consider the possibility of multiple test cases.\n\n        However, the problem says the input file has three lines. \n\n        Another interpretation: the entire input file is three lines, and these three lines are for one test case.\n\n        Then the example input provided in the problem is actually three separate inputs (each being a three-line input) but they are listed separately.\n\n        But the example input is given as a list of three strings, each string being a three-line input.\n\n        This suggests that the input file might contain multiple test cases, each test case being three lines.\n\n        How to handle?\n\n        The problem does not specify the number of test cases.\n\n        But note: the example input representation is:\n\n            ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n        This is three test cases, each test case having three lines.\n\n        So, the input file might be:\n\n            SANTACLAUS\n            DEDMOROZ\n            SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n            PAPAINOEL\n            JOULUPUKKI\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n            BABBONATALE\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        But then the input file has nine lines, not three.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might be designed for online judges where they provide one test case, but the example shows multiple.\n\n        Given the confusion, let's stick to the problem statement: the input file consists of three lines.\n\n        Therefore, we read three lines and solve one test case.\n\n        But the example input provided in the problem has three test cases. \n\n        Since the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", and then gives an example input and output, we must assume that the judge will provide one test case.\n\n        However, the example output is a list of three, so if we are to run the program multiple times, we would get three outputs.\n\n        But the problem says to read from stdin.\n\n        We must assume the judge will run the program once and provide three lines of input.\n\n        Therefore, we write the code for one test case.\n\n        Let me test with the first sample:\n\n            guest = \"SANTACLAUS\"\n            host = \"DEDMOROZ\"\n            pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        We computed that the combined string has 18 letters and the pile has 16, so it should output \"NO\", but the example says \"YES\".\n\n        This indicates a mistake in the example.\n\n        Alternatively, maybe the example intended the pile to be the combination of the two names, but the example provided a shuffled version that uses the correct letters? \n\n        But the counts don't match.\n\n        Let me try to form the combined string and the pile string by hand.\n\n        Combined: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n        Let me sort the combined string: \n\n            Combined sorted: ['A','A','C','D','D','E','L','M','N','O','O','R','S','S','T','U','Z'] -> wait, wait, we have 18 letters.\n\n        Pile sorted: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n            Sorted: ['A','A','A','C','D','D','E','L','M','N','O','O','R','S','S','T','U','Z'] -> wait, no, let me count the letters in the pile string:\n\n            Pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n            Let me break it down:\n\n            S, A, N, T, A, M, O, R, O, Z, D, E, D, C, L, A, U, S\n\n            Count:\n\n            S:2\n            A:3\n            N:1\n            T:1\n            M:1\n            O:2\n            R:1\n            Z:1\n            D:2\n            E:1\n            C:1\n            L:1\n            U:1\n\n            So the combined requires: \n                S:2, A:2, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n            The pile has:\n                S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n            The only difference is the count of A: 2 vs 3.\n\n        So, the example input for the pile has an extra 'A'.\n\n        Therefore, the example output should be \"NO\", not \"YES\".\n\n        But the example output is \"YES\".\n\n        There's a mistake in the problem statement's example.\n\n        However, the problem statement says the first sample output is \"YES\".\n\n        Let me double-check the example input:\n\n            guest: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n            host: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n            pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        What if the example meant to have the pile as \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" (the combined) but shuffled? \n\n        Then the pile should have the same letters. \n\n        But \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" has 18 letters and \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" has 16.\n\n        Alternatively, maybe the example input is miswritten.\n\n        After re‐examining the example: \n\n            The example input is given as:\n\n                ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n            But wait, the example input is a list of three strings, and each string is three lines. \n\n            The first string is: \"SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n            This means that the first test case has three lines: \n                Line1: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n                Line2: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n                Line3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n            And the second test case is the next string: \"PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n            And the third test case is the next string.\n\n        But our program reads three lines from stdin. \n\n        If the input file contains three test cases, then we would have to read until EOF.\n\n        How does the input look for three test cases?\n\n            Line1: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n            Line2: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n            Line3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n            Line4: \"PAPAINOEL\"\n            Line5: \"JOULUPUKKI\"\n            Line6: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n            Line7: \"BABBONATALE\"\n            Line8: \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n            Line9: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        Then we would need to loop for three test cases.\n\n        The problem does not specify the number of test cases.\n\n        But the example output is three answers.\n\n        Therefore, we must read until EOF and process multiple test cases.\n\n        Steps for multiple test cases:\n\n            We don't know the number of test cases.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves comparing the frequency of each letter in the combined names with the frequency of letters in the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: The input consists of three lines: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name to form a combined string.\n3. **Count Letters**: Use a counter to count the occurrences of each letter in both the combined string and the pile.\n4. **Compare Counts**: If the counts of all letters in the combined string match exactly with the counts in the pile, output \"YES\"; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match in letter frequencies between the combined names and the pile, ensuring no extra or missing letters are present.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    test_cases = [data[i:i+3] for i in range(0, len(data), 3)]\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        if len(case) < 3:\n            continue\n        guest = case[0].strip()\n        host = case[1].strip()\n        pile = case[2].strip()\n        combined_letters = guest + host\n        c_combined = Counter(combined_letters)\n        c_pile = Counter(pile)\n        if c_combined == c_pile:\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines. Each test case consists of three consecutive lines.\n2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, the guest's name and host's name are combined into a single string. The letters in this combined string and the pile are counted using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module.\n3. **Comparison**: The counts of letters in the combined string and the pile are compared. If they match exactly, it means the pile contains exactly the letters needed to form both names, and \"YES\" is appended to the results; otherwise, \"NO\" is appended.\n4. **Output**: The results for all test cases are printed, each on a new line.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and accurately determine whether the letters in the pile can be rearranged to form the required names, handling multiple test cases seamlessly.",
