He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem:\n\n We are given two tokens in the first line: a and b. \n   - a is an integer base (2 <= a <= 25)\n   - b can be either an integer (same constraints) or the letter 'R'\n\n Then we are given a string c which is a non-negative integer in base a (with possible leading zeros, but length <= 1000). The number is guaranteed to be representable.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Convert the given string c (which is in base a) to an integer in base 10.\n    Since the base a can be up to 25, and the string can have digits and letters (from 'A' onward for digits above 9), note:\n        - Digits in base a: from '0' to '9' and then 'A' to the (a-1)th digit (if a>10).\n        - But note: the input string c may contain leading zeros.\n\n 2. Then, if b is an integer (let's say base_b), convert the base10 integer to base b (if b is an integer) or to Roman numerals (if b is 'R').\n\n However, note the constraints on Roman numerals: \n    - The number is guaranteed to be at most 300010 (if Roman is involved) and not zero.\n\n How to convert from base a to base 10:\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"10 2\\n1\" -> base a=10, b=2, and the number is \"1\" (base10) so output \"1\" in base2 is \"1\"\n\n   Input: \"16 R\\n5\" -> base16 number \"5\" is 5 in base10. Then convert 5 to Roman: \"V\"\n\n   Input: \"5 R\\n4\" -> base5 number \"4\" is 4 in base10. Then convert 4 to Roman: \"IV\"\n\n   Input: \"2 2\\n1111001\" -> base2 number \"1111001\" is 121 in base10? Actually, wait: \n        In base2: 1111001 = 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64+32+16+8+1 = 121\n        Then we output 121 in base2. But note: we must omit leading zeros. So 121 in base2 is \"1111001\", which is the same as input because it was base2.\n\n   Input: \"12 13\\nA\" -> base12 number \"A\" (which is 10) is 10 in base10. Then convert 10 to base13: \n        10 // 13 = 0 remainder 10 -> so we use the representation for 10. In base13, we use digits: 0-9 and then A for 10. \n        So the digit for 10 is 'A'. Therefore output \"A\".\n\n Steps in detail:\n\n Step 1: Convert string c (in base a) to a base10 integer.\n\n   We can do this by iterating over each character in the string and converting it to a digit.\n\n   Let s = c (the string)\n\n   For each char in s:\n        if char is between '0' and '9': digit = int(char)\n        else: digit = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n\n   Then, the base10 value is: \n        num = 0\n        for each char in s:\n            num = num * a + digit_value(char)\n\n   But note: the string might have leading zeros, so we don't need to worry about that.\n\n Step 2: Check what b is.\n\n   Case 1: b is an integer (and we know 2<=b<=25). Then we convert the base10 integer to base b.\n\n        If the base10 integer is 0, then we output \"0\", but note the problem says the Roman numeral case doesn't include 0, but for other cases the number might be 0? \n        However, the input says \"non-negative integer\" and the example includes leading zeros. But note: the problem says \"its length doesn't exceed 1000\", so 0 is possible?\n\n        But also note: the guarantee for Roman numeral: the number would be <=300010 and not 0. So if we are in the Roman case, the input number is positive.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\", meaning very large, but we have to consider 0.\n\n        Actually, the input says: \"a non-negative integer\", so 0 is allowed.\n\n        We have to handle 0: if the base10 number is 0, then output \"0\".\n\n        How to convert base10 to base b?\n\n        We do standard conversion: repeatedly divide by b and record remainders.\n\n        However, note: the base b can be as low as 2 and as high as 25.\n\n        The digits for base b: \n            We'll use digits 0-9 and then letters from 'A' onward for digits >=10.\n\n        Steps for base conversion (when b is integer):\n\n            if n == 0: return \"0\"\n            digits = []\n            while n:\n                remainder = n % b\n                n = n // b\n                # Map remainder to a digit: if remainder < 10 then str(remainder) else chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10)\n                digits.append(str(remainder) if remainder < 10 else chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n\n            Then reverse digits.\n\n        But note: the problem says to omit leading zeros. This method naturally doesn't produce leading zeros.\n\n        However, if the number is 0, we must output \"0\". So we handle that separately.\n\n   Case 2: b is 'R'. Then convert the base10 integer to Roman numerals.\n\n        The number is at most 300010 and at least 1.\n\n        We can use the subtractive principle: we have the following symbols and their values:\n\n        M: 1000, CM: 900, D: 500, CD: 400, C: 100, XC: 90, L: 50, XL: 40, X: 10, IX: 9, V: 5, IV: 4, I: 1.\n\n        We can use a list of tuples (value, symbol) in descending order.\n\n        Steps for Roman conversion:\n\n          roman_numerals = [\n            (1000, \"M\"),\n            (900, \"CM\"),\n            (500, \"D\"),\n            (400, \"CD\"),\n            (100, \"C\"),\n            (90, \"XC\"),\n            (50, \"L\"),\n            (40, \"XL\"),\n            (10, \"X\"),\n            (9, \"IX\"),\n            (5, \"V\"),\n            (4, \"IV\"),\n            (1, \"I\")\n          ]\n\n          Then, for the given number n (base10 integer), we start from the highest tuple:\n\n          result = \"\"\n          for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n              while n >= value:\n                  result += symbol\n                  n -= value\n\n          Then output result.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the number is positive and at most 300010.\n\n        But wait: 300010 is 300,010. Our largest symbol is M (1000). We need to represent up to 300010.\n\n        We should extend our list to include the necessary symbols for thousands? Actually, the standard Roman numerals don't have a symbol for 5000, but the problem does not specify beyond 3000.\n\n        According to the problem, the number is at most 300010. So we need to represent up to 300010.\n\n        We can break 300010 as: 300000 + 10. But how do we represent 300000?\n\n        However, the problem states the subtractive principle only for the standard bases (like IV, IX, etc.) and doesn't specify for larger numbers. \n\n        But note: the example numbers are small (like 5, 4, etc.). Also, the problem says the number is at most 300010.\n\n        Standard Roman numerals use:\n\n          I: 1, V:5, X:10, L:50, C:100, D:500, M:1000.\n\n        And for numbers above 1000, they just repeat M: e.g., 2000 is MM, 3000 is MMM.\n\n        However, 300010 is 300,000 + 10. 300,000 is represented as CCCCCCC...? That would be 300 M's? Actually, no: 300,000 is three hundred thousand, so 300 * 1000 = MMM followed by 10? \n\n        But wait, 300,000 is represented as CCCCCCC... (but that's not standard). Actually, standard way is to use a bar above a symbol to denote multiplication by 1000, but that's not common.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify beyond the standard subtractive principle and the examples. But note the guarantee: the number is at most 300010.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          Break the number into thousands and the rest.\n\n          Alternatively, we can extend the list with:\n\n          (1000000, ...) but wait, 300010 is less than 1000000.\n\n        Actually, 300010 is 300010, which is 300,000 + 10. \n\n        How to represent 300,000? \n\n        According to the problem, we have the standard subtractive principle. There's no standard symbol for 1000000. But note: the problem doesn't require beyond 300010.\n\n        However, let me read the problem statement again: \"At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.\"\n\n        This implies that we use the standard subtractive principle for the standard base multiples. But for thousands, we don't have subtractive principles defined beyond the standard ones (like CM for 900, etc.). \n\n        Actually, the standard subtractive principle is only for the immediate next higher digit: e.g., for 900 we use CM (1000-100) and for 400 we use CD (500-100). Similarly, for thousands: \n          9000 would be CM (for the thousands place) but wait, actually 9000 is usually written as CM (but that would be 900) and then we need to represent the thousands separately.\n\n        Let me clarify: In standard Roman numerals, there is no fixed limit, but they typically use the same symbols and subtractive principle for the thousands. For example, 1999 is MCMXCIX.\n\n        But our number is up to 300010. So we can break it as:\n\n          300010 = 300 * 1000 + 10\n\n        And 300 * 1000 is represented as three times the symbol for 1000? But wait, 1000 is M, so 300000 is MMM (three M's) and then 10 is X.\n\n        However, 300010 is 300000 + 10. So we write MMMX.\n\n        But wait: 300000 is 3 * 1000, so MMM. Then 10 is X, so MMMX.\n\n        Now, is 300010 represented as MMMX? That is 300000 + 10 = 300010. Yes.\n\n        However, the standard way to write 300010 is MMMX? Actually, no. In standard Roman numerals, the representation for 300000 is MMM (or sometimes they use a bar for 1000000, but here we don't). \n\n        But note: the problem says the number is at most 300010. So we don't have to go beyond that.\n\n        Steps for Roman conversion (with the list above) will work for numbers up to 3999. However, 300010 is above 3999.\n\n        We need to handle numbers up to 300010.\n\n        Actually, our list above (the standard one) goes up to 1000 (M). So we need to represent numbers above 3999.\n\n        We can extend the list to include:\n\n          (1000000, ...) but we don't need that because 300010 < 1000000.\n\n        Instead, we can break the number into groups of thousands? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use a different approach: convert the number to a string of digits in base 10 (without using the standard Roman rules for the entire number) but then map each group of three digits (as if they were a number from 1 to 999) to its Roman numeral representation and then add the appropriate multiplier (like M for thousands).\n\n        However, the problem does not specify such a method. But note the subtractive principle is defined only for the standard base multiples. \n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" but that was for the initial base conversion. For Roman, the base conversion is done in base10.\n\n        After reading the problem statement, it seems that the Roman numeral system is the standard one, and we are to use the subtractive principle for the standard symbols. \n\n        However, the standard Roman numeral system doesn't have a symbol for 1000000, so they often use a bar above the M to mean 1000000, but we don't have that.\n\n        But note: the problem states the number is at most 300010, which is 300,010. \n\n        We can break the number as:\n\n          Let n = 300010\n\n          First, we can represent the thousands part and below separately.\n\n        Actually, the standard way is to use:\n\n          M for 1000, and then for numbers above 3999, we use the same symbols but with a bar or parentheses, but that's not standard.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify beyond the subtractive principle. But looking at the example: the number is at most 300010, which is 300000 + 10.\n\n        We can use:\n\n          For thousands: \n            We can use M repeated for the thousands, but wait: 1000 is M, 2000 is MM, 3000 is MMM, etc.\n\n          But then how to represent 4000? The problem says the maximum is 300010, so we don't need 4000.\n\n        So we can simply use:\n\n          Break the number into two parts: the part above 3999 and the part below 4000.\n\n        Actually, 300010 is 300000 + 10. 300000 is 300 * 1000, so we can break the number as:\n\n          total_thousands = n // 1000\n          remainder = n % 1000\n\n        Then, represent total_thousands as a number (in base10) in the thousands place, and then the remainder.\n\n        But wait, how do we represent 300000? It's 300 thousands, and 300 is represented as \"C\" (hundred) and then we use the same subtractive principle for the thousands? \n\n        Actually, no. The standard way is to use M for 1000, and then for 3000 we write MMM. Then 300000 would be MMM... (300 M's). But that would be too long.\n\n        However, the problem says the number is at most 300010, so 300000 is the maximum without the last 10. \n\n        But 300000 is 300,000, which is 300 * 1000. In Roman numerals, we don't have a separate symbol for 1000000, but we can use:\n\n          We can break 300000 as 3 * 1000000? No, because we don't have 1000000.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          300000 = 3 * 1000 * 1000. But again, no symbol for 1000000.\n\n        Actually, in standard Roman numerals, numbers above 3999 are represented by placing a bar over the symbols to multiply by 1000. But the problem doesn't mention that.\n\n        After re‐reading the problem: it says \"the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc.\" — meaning the same additive and subtractive principles as usual.\n\n        So, we can use:\n\n          We have symbols for 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000.\n\n        Then, for numbers above 1000, we can use the same symbols and the subtractive principle for the thousands? \n\n        Actually, no. The standard subtractive principle is only for the immediate next higher digit. For example, to write 4000, you cannot write IIII 1000 times, you write the subtractive form for the thousands: 4000 is MMMM? Actually, no, in standard Roman numerals, 4000 is usually written as IV with a bar (meaning 4000) but that's not standard.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we only need to represent numbers from 1 to 300010.\n\n        How to represent 300010?\n\n        We can break the number into two parts: the thousands and the rest.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Let n = 300010\n\n          We can use the fact that the standard Roman numerals do not have a symbol for 1000000, but we can use the same symbols and the subtractive principle for the thousands.\n\n          However, the standard subtractive principle is defined for the immediate next higher digit. So for thousands, the next higher digit is ten thousands (or we don't have a ten thousands symbol). \n\n        Actually, we can use the same algorithm as for numbers below 4000, but we break the number into groups of thousands.\n\n        Example: 300010\n\n          We can write:\n\n          = 300 * 1000 + 10\n\n          Now, we represent 300 in the context of thousands? Actually, no. We can represent 300010 as:\n\n          = 3 * 100000 + 0 * 10000 + ... but that's complicated.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a modified list that includes:\n\n          (1000000, ...) but we don't need that.\n\n        Or we can use a recursive breakdown: \n\n          We know that the largest symbol is M (1000). So we can break the number as:\n\n          Let n = 300010\n\n          We can use the standard list for numbers < 4000, but then for the thousands part, we use the same symbols multiplied by 1000? \n\n        Actually, standard Roman numerals for numbers above 3999 are represented by adding a bar (or parentheses) above the symbols. But we don't have that.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify the representation for numbers above 3999. But note the example: the number is at most 300010, so we can represent 300010 as:\n\n          MMMX\n\n        Why? Because:\n\n          MMM = 3000\n          X = 10\n\n          So 3000 + 10 = 3010, not 300010.\n\n        Wait, 300010 is three hundred thousand and ten.\n\n        How to represent three hundred thousand? \n\n          We break the number as: 300 * 1000.\n\n        But in Roman numerals, we don't have a direct symbol for 1000000. We can use:\n\n          1000 is M, so 1000000 would be M with a bar (but we don't have bar). \n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          1000 = M\n          2000 = MM\n          3000 = MMM\n\n          4000 = MMMM? But wait, the subtractive principle says that for 4000, we should use the next higher symbol. The next higher symbol after M (1000) is ? There isn't one. So we use MMMM.\n\n          Then 5000 = (MMMMM) or sometimes they use ((M)) or something else, but the problem doesn't specify.\n\n        But note: the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we only need to represent up to 300010.\n\n        We can break 300010 as:\n\n          = 300 * 1000 + 10\n\n        Now, how to represent 300? We use the standard way for numbers below 1000.\n\n        Then, we can say: 300010 is represented as the Roman numeral for 300 followed by the Roman numeral for 10, but then we have to account for the thousands.\n\n        Actually, standard way is to use the same symbols and the subtractive principle for the entire number. \n\n        Let me look up: \n\n        The largest number commonly written in Roman numerals is 3999 (MMMCMXCIX). \n\n        For numbers above 3999, they use a bar (or other notations) to indicate multiplication by 1000. \n\n        But our number is 300010, which is 300010.\n\n        We can write 300010 as:\n\n          300000 + 10\n\n        And 300000 is 300 * 1000.\n\n        We can break 300000 as:\n\n          300000 = 3 * 1000000, but we don't have 1000000.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          1000 is M, so 1000000 is represented as a bar over M, but we don't have that.\n\n        Another idea: the problem says \"the same for other bases\", but that refers to the initial base conversion. For Roman, we are to use the standard system.\n\n        Since the problem does not specify, and the example numbers are small, maybe we are only expected to handle numbers up to 3999? But wait, the input guarantee says: \"if we have Roman numerals included the number would be <=300010\", so we must handle up to 300010.\n\n        After some thought, we can use:\n\n          We know that the standard Roman numerals go up to 3999. For 4000 and above, we can use the same symbols and the subtractive principle, but with the understanding that the symbols can be repeated arbitrarily.\n\n        However, 300010 is 300000 + 10. \n\n        We can write:\n\n          300000: \n            We break 300000 as 3 * 1000000? Not available.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the fact that 1000000 is not needed, but 300000 is 3 * 1000 * 1000, so we can represent 300000 as \"MMMX\" repeated 300 times? That would be 300 M's and then an X? No, that would be 300*1000 + 10, which is 300010.\n\n        But wait, 300 M's is 300 * 1000 = 300000, and then we add 10 (X) to get 300010.\n\n        So the Roman numeral for 300010 is \"MM...MX\" (300 M's and then an X). But 300 M's is too many to write.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a more compact representation? \n\n        Actually, in standard Roman numerals, they don't have a symbol for 1000000, so they use multiple M's. But 300 M's is acceptable if we are allowed to generate that many characters.\n\n        However, the problem says the number is at most 300010, and 300010 is 300000+10, and 300000 is 300 * 1000, so 300 M's.\n\n        But note: the problem says the input number (in base a) is given as a string of up to 1000 characters. So the base10 integer can be very large? Actually, no: the problem says \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\", but wait, 10^15^10 is 10^(15^10) which is a huge number, but in the Roman case the number is limited to 300010.\n\n        So for the Roman case, we are only dealing with numbers up to 300010.\n\n        But 300010 is 300000 + 10, and 300000 is 300 * 1000, so we need to represent 300000.\n\n        How do we represent 300000?\n\n        We can break it as 3 * 1000000, but we don't have 1000000.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the same symbols and the subtractive principle for the thousands, but for the hundred thousands? \n\n        Actually, we can use:\n\n          We have symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D, M.\n\n        And we can use:\n\n          1000 = M\n          2000 = MM\n          ...\n          1000000 = (M) [but we don't have that]\n\n        Or we can use:\n\n          1000 = M\n          10000 = ? There's no standard symbol for 10000.\n\n        The problem does not specify, so we must rely on the fact that the number is at most 300010, which is 300010.\n\n        We can use the following trick:\n\n          We break the number into two parts: the part that is multiple of 1000 and the rest.\n\n          Let n = 300010\n\n          thousands_part = n // 1000   # 300\n          remainder = n % 1000         # 10\n\n          Then, we represent the thousands_part (300) in the same way as we would for numbers below 1000, but then we multiply by 1000 by adding three M's? \n\n          Actually, no. The standard way is to represent the entire number, not breaking it arbitrarily.\n\n        But wait, there is a standard way to represent large numbers: \n\n          - They use the same symbols and the subtractive principle, but for numbers above 3999, they put the entire numeral in parentheses to multiply by 1000.\n\n        Example: 4000 is (IV) or 4000 is IV with a bar, but the problem does not specify.\n\n        However, the problem says the number is at most 300010, and 300010 is 300000 + 10.\n\n        We can use:\n\n          300000 = 3 * 1000000, but we don't have 1000000.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          300000 = 3 * 1000 * 1000 = MMM * 1000, but that's circular.\n\n        I think we need to use the standard method for large numbers: \n\n          We can use the same set of symbols and the subtractive principle, but we break the number into groups of thousands.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Let n = 300010\n\n            We can break n as: 300 * 1000 + 10\n\n            Then, we represent 300 as a Roman numeral (without the thousands) and then we add three M's? No.\n\n        Actually, standard representation for large numbers is to write the Roman numeral for the number without the last three digits, and then append the Roman numeral for the last three digits, but that's not it.\n\n        After research, the standard way is:\n\n          Numbers above 3999 are represented by placing a bar (or using parentheses) over the symbols for the thousands. \n\n          For example, 8,000 is Ⅰ̅ (bar over I) which means 10000, but that's not helpful.\n\n        Given the complexity and the fact that the problem states the number is at most 300010, and 300010 is 300000+10, we can do:\n\n          We know that 300000 = 300 * 1000, and 1000 is M.\n\n          We can represent 300000 as \"MM...M\" (300 M's) and then \"X\" for 10.\n\n        But 300 M's is 300 characters. The problem says the input string c has length <=1000, but the output for Roman can be long.\n\n        However, the problem does not restrict the output length, so we can output a string of 300 M's and then an X.\n\n        But wait, 300 M's is 300 * 1 (each M is one character) so 300 characters, which is acceptable.\n\n        But is that the correct representation?\n\n          In standard Roman numerals, 300000 is represented as three hundred thousand, which is 300 * 1000. Each 1000 is M, so we write M three hundred times. \n\n          However, in practice, they used spaces or other notations, but according to the additive principle, yes.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n          For the Roman numeral conversion:\n\n            If n >= 1000:\n                thousands = n // 1000\n                remainder = n % 1000\n                roman_thousands = \"\"   # This is going to be \"M\" repeated 'thousands' times? But wait, thousands can be up to 300 (since n<=300010, so thousands<=300)\n\n                However, 300 is less than 1000, so we can represent thousands as a number from 1 to 300 in the thousands place.\n\n                But note: the standard subtractive principle applies to the thousands as well? \n\n                Actually, no: the subtractive principle is defined for the entire numeral system, but the standard subtractive principle for thousands would be:\n\n                  For 4000: we don't have a symbol for 5000, so we use MMMM (4 M's) and not the subtractive form.\n\n                But wait, the subtractive principle is only for the immediate next higher digit. For thousands, the next higher digit is ten thousands, which we don't have. So we use additive repetition.\n\n                However, we can also use the subtractive principle for thousands if we had a symbol for 10000 (like X with a bar). But we don't.\n\n                Therefore, we simply represent the thousands part as a series of M's (each M is 1000) and then the remainder in the standard way.\n\n                But wait, what if the thousands part is 1999? Then we would write 1999 M's? That's not efficient.\n\n                Actually, the standard way for numbers above 3999 is to use the same subtractive principle but with a bar or parentheses. But since we don't have that, we can only use additive.\n\n                However, there is a known issue: the subtractive principle is defined for the entire system, so for example, 4000 could be written as MMMM (without subtractive) or if we had a symbol for 5000, we would use that. But we don't.\n\n                Since the problem does not specify, and the maximum thousands part is 300 (so 300 * 1000 = 300000) and 300 is less than 1000, we can represent the thousands part (300) as a number in base10 and then convert that number to Roman numerals for the thousands? \n\n                But wait, that would be incorrect. The thousands part is 300, and we want to represent 300 * 1000, so we write 300 M's.\n\n                However, 300 M's is a lot. Is there a better way?\n\n                We can represent 300 in Roman numerals and then use that to determine how many M's? But that doesn't make sense.\n\n                Actually, we can use the same subtractive principle for the thousands part if we consider that 1000 is the base for thousands. But the subtractive principle is defined for the entire numeral system, not per place.\n\n                Let me clarify: the subtractive principle is applied to the entire numeral. For example, 4000 is represented as MMMM, but sometimes they use IV with a bar (which means 4 * 1000). But we don't have bars.\n\n                Since the problem does not specify, and the input number is at most 300010, and 300010 is 300000+10, we can simply do:\n\n                  if n >= 1000:\n                    thousands = n // 1000\n                    remainder = n % 1000\n                    roman_rep = \"\"\n                    # Represent 'thousands' in the thousands place: we use M repeated 'thousands' times, but wait, thousands can be up to 300, and we want to use the subtractive principle even for the thousands part?\n\n                    Actually, no: the subtractive principle is defined for the entire numeral, but the thousands part is itself a number that might be represented with subtractive principles.\n\n                    However, the thousands part is a number from 1 to 3",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, with the possibility of the target base being the Roman numeral system. The solution involves three main steps: converting the input number from its given base to base 10, then converting the base 10 number to the desired target base (either an integer base or Roman numerals).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The input number is provided as a string in base `a`. We convert this string to a base 10 integer by processing each character, converting it to its numerical value, and accumulating the total value using the base `a`.\n\n2. **Conversion to Target Base**:\n   - **Integer Base**: If the target base `b` is an integer, we convert the base 10 number to base `b` by repeatedly dividing the number by `b` and collecting remainders. The remainders are then mapped to their corresponding digits (0-9 and A-Z for values beyond 9).\n   - **Roman Numerals**: If the target base is 'R', we convert the base 10 number to Roman numerals using a predefined list of value-symbol pairs. The conversion involves iterating through these pairs and appending the appropriate symbols to the result string while subtracting the corresponding values from the number.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    a_str = first_line[0]\n    b_str = first_line[1] if len(first_line) > 1 else None\n    \n    num_str = data[1].strip()\n    \n    try:\n        a = int(a_str)\n    except Exception:\n        a = a_str\n        \n    try:\n        b = int(b_str) if b_str != 'R' else 'R'\n    except Exception:\n        b = b_str\n        \n    if a == 1:\n        num_val = 0\n    else:\n        num_val = 0\n        for char in num_str:\n            if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                digit = ord(char) - ord('0')\n            else:\n                digit = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n            num_val = num_val * a + digit\n\n    if b == 'R':\n        if num_val == 0:\n            print(\"\")\n            return\n            \n        roman_numerals = [\n            (1000, \"M\"),\n            (900, \"CM\"),\n            (500, \"D\"),\n            (400, \"CD\"),\n            (100, \"C\"),\n            (90, \"XC\"),\n            (50, \"L\"),\n            (40, \"XL\"),\n            (10, \"X\"),\n            (9, \"IX\"),\n            (5, \"V\"),\n            (4, \"IV\"),\n            (1, \"I\")\n        ]\n        res = []\n        for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n            while num_val >= value:\n                res.append(symbol)\n                num_val -= value\n                \n        roman_str = ''.join(res)\n        print(roman_str)\n        \n    else:\n        if num_val == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n            return\n            \n        base_b = int(b)\n        digits = []\n        n = num_val\n        while n:\n            remainder = n % base_b\n            n = n // base_b\n            if remainder < 10:\n                digits.append(str(remainder))\n            else:\n                digits.append(chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n                \n        if not digits:\n            print(\"0\")\n        else:\n            digits.reverse()\n            print(''.join(digits))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the bases `a` and `b`, and the number string `c`.\n2. **Base Conversion**: The number string `c` is converted from base `a` to a base 10 integer. Each character in the string is processed to determine its numerical value, which is then used to compute the total value in base 10.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target base is 'R', the base 10 number is converted to Roman numerals by iterating through a list of value-symbol pairs. The largest value less than or equal to the current number is subtracted, and the corresponding symbol is appended to the result string.\n4. **Integer Base Conversion**: For an integer target base, the base 10 number is divided by the target base repeatedly.
