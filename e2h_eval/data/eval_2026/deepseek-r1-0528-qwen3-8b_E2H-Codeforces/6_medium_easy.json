Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by breaking it down into steps.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The total duration x is fixed. We note that each voucher i has duration d_i = (r_i - l_i + 1). We require two vouchers with durations adding to x.\n\n 2. Conditions for two vouchers i and j (i != j) to be non-intersecting:\n    Condition 1: r_i < l_j   OR\n    Condition 2: r_j < l_i\n\n 3. We can group the vouchers by their duration. Let's create a dictionary (or list of lists) where the key is the duration d, and the value is a list of tuples (l, r, cost) for that duration.\n\n 4. However, note that we have two conditions for non-intersection. We can consider two cases:\n    Case A: The first voucher ends before the second starts (r_i < l_j)\n    Case B: The second voucher ends before the first starts (r_j < l_i)\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can think of the two vouchers as having durations d1 and d2 such that d1 + d2 = x.\n    Then, we want to choose one voucher from duration d1 and one from duration d2, and check if they are non-intersecting.\n\n 6. But note: It might be that the same voucher is used twice? No, because we need two different ones. Also, the condition is that the two vouchers don't intersect.\n\n 7. We can precompute for each distinct duration d (that appears) the best cost for a voucher of duration d that ends at or below some point? Actually, we need to combine two vouchers.\n\n 8. Let's restructure:\n    We need to consider pairs (d1, d2) such that d1 + d2 == x.\n\n    For a given pair (d1, d2):\n        We will consider two possibilities:\n            Possibility 1: Use a voucher with duration d1 (say [l1, r1]) and a voucher with duration d2 (say [l2, r2]) such that r1 < l2.\n            Possibility 2: Use a voucher with duration d2 and then d1 such that r2 < l1.\n\n        But note: In possibility 1, the first voucher must end before the second starts. Similarly, possibility 2 is just the reverse.\n\n        Actually, we can combine these two by considering the two orders. However, note that the two vouchers are distinct and the condition is symmetric in the sense that either one must come first.\n\n        But wait: the problem does not specify which voucher goes first. So we can consider:\n\n        For a fixed pair (d1, d2) = (a, b) with a+b=x, we want to consider:\n            Option 1: a voucher of duration a and then a voucher of duration b that starts after the first ends.\n            Option 2: a voucher of duration b and then a voucher of duration a that starts after the second ends.\n\n        However, note: the condition for non-intersection is OR, so we only need one of them. But when we fix the order, we are effectively checking one of the conditions.\n\n        Actually, we can do: \n            For each voucher of duration a, we look for a voucher of duration b that starts after the end of the first (i.e., r1 < l2). But also, we might have the case that the second voucher is taken first, but then the condition would be r2 < l1. \n\n        However, note: the condition is independent of the order. We can consider two separate cases:\n\n        Case 1: The voucher of duration a comes first and then the one of duration b. Then we require r_a < l_b.\n        Case 2: The voucher of duration b comes first and then the one of duration a. Then we require r_b < l_a.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to take two vouchers arbitrarily. However, the condition is about the intervals: they must not overlap. So if we have two intervals [l1, r1] and [l2, r2], then they do not overlap if either r1 < l2 or r2 < l1.\n\n        This is symmetric. Therefore, we can consider the two orders independently.\n\n        But wait: if we fix the two vouchers, then we have two possibilities for which one is first? Actually, the condition doesn't care about the order. However, when we fix the two vouchers, the condition is automatically checked by the two intervals.\n\n        Alternate approach:\n\n        We can group by duration and then for each duration d, we store the intervals (l, r, cost) and we want to quickly find an interval of duration d that ends at a certain time or starts after a certain time.\n\n 9. We can do:\n\n    Step 1: Precompute all durations and group by d.\n\n    Step 2: For each duration d, we want to be able to query:\n        - What is the minimal cost for an interval of duration d that ends by a certain day (for condition r <= some_day) OR starts after a certain day (for condition l >= some_day)?\n\n    However, note: condition for non-intersection is either:\n        Condition 1: r1 < l2   -> for two intervals [l1, r1] and [l2, r2]\n        Condition 2: r2 < l1\n\n    But when we fix the two durations (d1 and d2) and we have two intervals, we can check both conditions. However, we are free to assign the two intervals in any order.\n\n    Actually, we can break the problem:\n\n        We require two intervals i and j (with durations d_i and d_j) such that:\n            d_i + d_j = x, and (r_i < l_j OR r_j < l_i)\n\n        But note: the condition is symmetric. So we can consider:\n\n        Let A be the set of intervals of duration d1, and B the set of intervals of duration d2 (where d1+d2=x).\n\n        Then we want to minimize cost_i + cost_j over all pairs (i in A, j in B) such that either:\n            (a) r_i < l_j   OR\n            (b) r_j < l_i\n\n        However, note: condition (b) is equivalent to j being entirely before i. Similarly, condition (a) is i entirely before j.\n\n        But wait: what if the two intervals are not in the same order? Actually, the condition is independent of the order. We can consider:\n\n        We want to avoid overlapping. The condition is that the two intervals do not share any common day.\n\n        Now, note: if we have two intervals, we can always assume without loss of generality that we are considering the first interval and then the second. But the condition is symmetric.\n\n        Alternate Insight:\n\n        We can consider two cases separately:\n\n        Case 1: The first voucher (duration d1) is entirely before the second (duration d2). Then we require: r1 < l2.\n\n        Case 2: The second voucher (duration d2) is entirely before the first (duration d1). Then we require: r2 < l1.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to choose any two. So we can combine both cases by considering the entire set of vouchers for duration d1 and d2.\n\n        However, we cannot simply mix the two cases because the two durations are fixed (d1 and d2). But note: d1 and d2 are fixed by the equation d1+d2=x.\n\n        But wait: d1 and d2 are determined by the equation. We can iterate over all d1 from 1 to x-1, and set d2 = x - d1.\n\n        However, note: the problem constraints: n, x up to 200,000. And the days (l, r) are up to 200,000.\n\n        We can do:\n\n        For each duration d, we store a list of (l, r, cost). Then for each duration d, we want to be able to quickly query:\n\n            Given a target start day (say s), what is the minimal cost of an interval of duration d that starts at least s? (But note: we know the duration, so r = l + d - 1. So if we know l, then r is fixed.)\n\n        Actually, for a fixed duration d, each voucher is defined by its l (then r = l + d - 1). Then the condition for non-overlap:\n\n        Case 1: First voucher (duration d1) must end before the second (duration d2) starts: \n            r1 < l2  => (l1 + d1 - 1) < l2.\n\n        Case 2: Second voucher (duration d2) must end before the first (duration d1) starts:\n            r2 < l1  => (l2 + d2 - 1) < l1.\n\n        So for a fixed pair (d1, d2) with d1+d2=x:\n\n            We want to consider:\n                Case 1: Find a voucher i (duration d1) and a voucher j (duration d2) such that (l_i + d1 - 1) < l_j.\n\n                Case 2: Find a voucher j (duration d2) and a voucher i (duration d1) such that (l_j + d2 - 1) < l_i.\n\n        But note: we are iterating over d1 and d2, and we are looking for the minimal total cost.\n\n        How to do this efficiently?\n\n        We can precompute for each duration d:\n\n            Let L[d] = sorted list of l values for all vouchers of duration d.\n            Let min_cost_by_start[d] = a sorted structure by l (or by r) and then store the minimal cost for a voucher of duration d with start l (or end r) at that l.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            For each duration d, we can create an array (or list) of tuples (l, cost) and then sort by l.\n\n            Then, we want to answer queries: \n                For Case 1: Given d1, d2, and a constraint on l_j (which must be > (l_i + d1 - 1)), we want the minimal cost for a voucher of duration d2 with l_j > (l_i + d1 - 1).\n\n            Similarly, for Case 2: Given d1, d2, and a constraint on l_i (which must be > (l_j + d2 - 1)), we want the minimal cost for a voucher of duration d1 with l_i > (l_j + d2 - 1).\n\n        However, note: we are going to iterate over d1 from 1 to x-1, and for each d1 we have d2 = x - d1.\n\n        But the total number of distinct durations might be up to 200,000, and we cannot iterate over every d1 from 1 to 200000 and then for each voucher of duration d1 and then do a binary search for the other duration.\n\n        That would be too slow.\n\n 10. Another idea:\n\n        Instead, we can precompute for each duration d, we store:\n            - The minimal cost for a voucher of duration d (without considering the non-intersection condition) is not enough because the non-intersection condition depends on the exact l and r.\n\n        We need to consider the entire set of vouchers for a given duration d and then combine with the set for duration d2.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            Step 1: Group by duration d, and for each duration d, store a list of (l, r, cost) and then sort by l (so that we can use the condition on l).\n\n            Step 2: For a fixed d1 and d2 (with d1+d2=x), we want:\n\n                Case 1: For each voucher i in d1 (with l_i, then r_i = l_i+d1-1) we require l_j > r_i, i.e., l_j > l_i+d1-1. Then we look for the minimal cost in d2 for any voucher j with l_j > l_i+d1-1.\n\n                Case 2: Similarly, for each voucher j in d2 (with l_j, then r_j = l_j+d2-1) we require l_i > r_j, i.e., l_i > l_j+d2-1. Then we look for the minimal cost in d1 for any voucher i with l_i > l_j+d2-1.\n\n            Then the total cost for a pair is cost_i + cost_j.\n\n        Then we take the minimum total cost over all pairs.\n\n        But the problem: the total number of vouchers is up to 200000, and the distinct durations might be many. However, note that the sum of the sizes of all groups is n (<=200000). But if we iterate over each voucher in d1 and then do a query in d2, and similarly for d2 in case 2, then the total work would be O(n^2) in the worst-case.\n\n        We need to optimize.\n\n 11. We can preprocess each duration d (if it exists) by:\n\n            Sorting the list of (l, cost) for duration d by l.\n\n            Then, we can build a Fenwick tree or segment tree for the minimal cost for a given l (or for a given range of l). However, note: we want to query for all l greater than a value.\n\n            Alternatively, we can precompute for each duration d:\n\n                Let arr = sorted list of (l, cost) for duration d.\n                Then, we can create an array for the minimal cost from the right (or left) for a given l.\n\n            Specifically, for each duration d, we can:\n\n                Sort by l: then we have increasing l.\n                Then, we can create an array min_cost_from_right[d] for the minimal cost for all vouchers with l >= some value.\n\n            But note: the condition for Case 1 is: we need the minimal cost in d2 for any voucher with l > (l_i + d1 - 1).\n\n            We can precompute for each duration d:\n\n                Let events = sorted list of (l, cost) for d.\n                Then, we can create an array for the minimal cost for all vouchers with l >= some value.\n\n                Steps for a fixed d:\n\n                    Sort the list of (l, cost) by l.\n                    Then, traverse from the smallest l to the largest, and keep a running minimum for cost (from the current position to the end). But note: we want to query by l: we want the minimal cost for any voucher with l >= target.\n\n                Actually, we can do:\n\n                    Let sorted_d = sorted([(l, cost) for (l, r, cost) in group[d]], key=lambda x: x[0])\n                    Then, we can create an array min_cost_arr for the minimal cost from the current index to the end (in terms of increasing l).\n\n                    But note: the list is sorted by l, so we can do:\n\n                    min_cost_arr[i] = minimum cost from index i to the end.\n\n                    Then, we can do a binary search for the first index j such that sorted_d[j][0] > (l_i + d1 - 1). Then the minimal cost for d2 (if d2 exists) in that range is min_cost_arr[j] (if j exists).\n\n            However, note: we are going to do this for each d1 and each voucher in d1. Then the total work would be O(n) per voucher and overall O(n^2). We cannot do that.\n\n 12. We need to invert the thinking.\n\n        Instead, we can consider:\n\n            We want to combine two groups: d1 and d2 (with d1+d2=x). We have two cases.\n\n            For Case 1: We require that the first voucher (d1) ends before the second (d2) starts. The condition is: l2 > (l1 + d1 - 1).\n\n            We can think: For a fixed d1 and d2, we want to consider the set of vouchers in d1 and d2. The condition is that the second voucher (d2) must start after the end of the first.\n\n            So, we can precompute for d2 (the duration) the minimal cost for any voucher that starts at or above a certain l.\n\n            Then, for each voucher in d1 (with l1, cost1) we can compute the required starting day for d2: start_req = l1 + d1 (because the end is l1+d1-1, so we need l2 > l1+d1-1, i.e., l2 >= l1+d1).\n\n            Then, we look up in d2: the minimal cost for a voucher with l2 >= l1+d1.\n\n            Similarly, for Case 2: For a fixed d1 and d2, we require that the first voucher (d2) ends before the second (d1) starts. The condition is: l1 > (l2 + d2 - 1) -> l1 >= l2+d2.\n\n            Then, for each voucher in d2 (with l2, cost2) we compute the required start for d1: start_req = l2 + d2.\n\n            Then, we look up in d1: the minimal cost for a voucher with l1 >= l2+d2.\n\n        Then, the total cost for a pair in Case 1 is cost1 + (minimal cost in d2 for l>=l1+d1).\n        Similarly for Case 2: cost2 + (minimal cost in d1 for l>=l2+d2).\n\n        Then, we take the minimum over all these.\n\n        But note: we are iterating over d1 and d2 (which are fixed by d1+d2=x) and then over all vouchers in d1 and d2. The total number of vouchers is n, but the distinct durations might be many. However, the total number of vouchers is n, so the sum over d1 of the number of vouchers in d1 is n. Similarly for d2.\n\n        But note: the equation d1+d2=x defines a unique d2 for each d1. However, we are iterating over d1 from 1 to x-1, but if a duration d1 does not appear, we skip. Similarly for d2.\n\n        But the total distinct durations might be up to 200000, and we are iterating over d1 from 1 to x-1 (which is 200000) and then for each voucher in d1 (which might be many) and then do a lookup in d2. However, the total number of vouchers is n (<=200000). So the total work would be O(n) for each distinct d1? Actually, we are iterating over each distinct d1 that exists, and for each voucher in that d1 we do a lookup in d2.\n\n        But note: the same d1 might appear multiple times (but we are grouping by duration, so we have one group per duration). However, we are iterating over each distinct duration d1 that satisfies d1 <= x-1 and d2 = x-d1 exists. But note: we are grouping by duration, so we have stored the list of vouchers for each duration.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Step 1: Read input and group by duration.\n\n            Step 2: Precompute for each duration d that exists:\n\n                    If d exists, let L = sorted list of (l, cost) for that duration.\n                    Then, create a mapping from l to the minimal cost for that l? Actually, we want to query by l: we want the minimal cost for any voucher with l >= a given value.\n\n                    We can do:\n\n                        Sort L by l (if not already sorted).\n                        Then, create an array of the l's and an array min_cost from the last element backwards.\n\n                    Specifically, for a fixed duration d:\n\n                        Let arr = sorted([(l, cost) for ...], key=lambda x: x[0])\n                        Let min_costs = [0]*len(arr)\n                        min_so_far = a big number\n                        for i in range(len(arr)-1, -1, -1):\n                            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, arr[i][1])\n                            min_costs[i] = min_so_far\n\n                    Then, we can use bisect to find the first index with l >= target.\n\n            Step 3: Iterate over each distinct duration d1 (that is in our groups and d1 <= x-1 and d2 = x-d1 is also in the groups):\n\n                    Case 1: \n                        For each voucher in d1: (l1, cost1)\n                            required_l2 = l1 + d1   # because we need l2 > l1+d1-1, so l2 >= l1+d1\n                            Then, in d2, we need to find the minimal cost for any voucher with l2 >= required_l2.\n\n                        Case 2: \n                        For each voucher in d2: (l2, cost2)\n                            required_l1 = l2 + d2\n                            Then, in d1, we need to find the minimal cost for any voucher with l1 >= required_l1.\n\n                    Then, update the answer with the minimal total cost.\n\n            Step 4: If we found at least one valid pair, output the minimal total cost, else output -1.\n\n        However, note: the above iteration over each voucher in d1 and d2 for each distinct (d1,d2) might be heavy.\n\n        How many distinct (d1,d2) pairs? Only those d1 such that d1 exists and d2 = x-d1 exists. The number of distinct durations is at most the number of distinct d in the input, which is <= 200000. But note: the total number of vouchers is n (<=200000). \n\n        But wait: we are iterating over each distinct d1 (that satisfies the condition) and then for each voucher in d1 (which is the size of the group for d1) and then for each voucher in d2 (which is the size of the group for d2). Then the total work would be:\n\n            Sum_{d1} [ |group[d1]| * (cost of lookup in d2) + |group[d2]| * (cost of lookup in d1) ]\n\n        But note: the same voucher might be considered in multiple pairs? Actually, no: we are iterating by distinct d1. But the total number of distinct d1 is at most 200000, and the total number of vouchers is n, so the worst-case is if we have many distinct durations, but the sum of the sizes of all groups is n.\n\n        However, note: we are iterating over each distinct d1 (that is in the groups and d2=x-d1 is in the groups) and then for each voucher in d1 (and similarly for d2). The total work is:\n\n            For each distinct d1 (with d2=x-d1 existing) we do:\n                For each voucher in d1: one lookup in d2 (O(log|group[d2]|))\n                For each voucher in d2: one lookup in d1 (O(log|group[d1]|))\n\n        Then, the total work is O( (|group[d1]| + |group[d2]|) * log(n) ) for each distinct d1 (with d2=x-d1).\n\n        Since the total number of distinct d1 is at most the number of distinct durations that are <= x-1 and for which x-d1 is also present, and the sum of |group[d]| over all d is n, but note: the same voucher is in one group, so the total work is:\n\n            Sum_{d1: d1 and x-d1 exist} [ |group[d1]| + |group[x-d1]| ] * log(n)\n\n        But note: the set of distinct durations is the keys of the dictionary. The total sum of |group[d]| for d in distinct durations is n. However, we are summing for each distinct d1 (with d2=x-d1) the sizes of two groups. And the same group may appear multiple times (if there are multiple d1 such that x-d1 = d, then the same group d will be accessed multiple times). \n\n        But note: the distinct durations are the keys. The equation d1+d2=x. The same group d might be used as d1 and as d2 (if d1 = d2, then x=2*d1, and then we are using the same group twice). However, in that case, we are iterating over d1 and then d2=x-d1, so if d1=d2, then we are considering the same group for both. But then we are doing:\n\n            Case 1: For each voucher in d1, look in d2 (which is the same as d1) for a voucher with l >= (l1+d1) (which is the same as l >= l1+d1). But note: the condition requires two different vouchers. However, we are storing the entire group for d1, so we must ensure we don't pick the same voucher twice.\n\n        How to avoid using the same voucher twice? \n\n        Actually, the problem requires two distinct vouchers. In our method, we are storing the entire group, so when we do the lookup in d2 (which is the same as d1) we might pick the same voucher if it satisfies the condition. But note: the condition is l2 >= l1+d1. For the same voucher (l1, cost1) we have: l1+d1 is the end+1. So if the same voucher has l1+d1 <= l1? That's impossible. Actually, the same voucher's start is l1, and we require l2 >= l1+d1. Since d1>=1, then l2>=l1+1. So the same voucher (with start l1) does not satisfy l2>=l1+d1 (because l1 < l1+d1). So we are safe.\n\n        However, we must consider: what if there are two identical vouchers? Then the same voucher might appear twice in the group. But the problem says \"two vouchers\", meaning two distinct indices. But note: if two vouchers are identical, they are still two different instances. The condition is non-intersection. If they are identical, then they are [l, l+d1-1] and [l, l+d1-1] and then they definitely intersect (unless d1==0, but d1>=1). So we are okay.\n\n        But note: the condition for non-intersection is strict: at least one of the conditions must hold. So if we have two identical vouchers, then neither condition holds (because r1 = l1+d1-1, and l2=l1, so r1>=l2? Actually, condition 1: r1 < l2 -> l1+d1-1 < l1 -> d1-1 <0 -> false. Condition 2: r2 < l1 -> same as condition 1). So they are not disjoint. Therefore, even if the same voucher appears twice (as two separate entries in the list) we cannot use them together. However, in our grouping, we are storing each voucher. So if the same voucher (same l, same r, same cost) appears twice, then we have two identical intervals. Then when we do the lookup in the same group, we will get the minimal cost from the entire group (including itself). But the condition requires two distinct vouchers. However, if we have two identical vouchers, then we can use one and then the other? \n\n        Let me check: \n            Condition 1: r1 < l2 -> (l1+d1-1) < l2. But if the two vouchers are identical, then l2 = l1, so (l1+d1-1) < l1 -> d1-1<0 -> false.\n            Condition 2: r2 < l1 -> same.\n\n        So two identical vouchers are not disjoint. Therefore, we must not consider them together.\n\n        But note: we are storing the entire group. When we do the lookup in d2 (same as d1) for a voucher with l2>=l1+d1, we are not excluding the current voucher. However, the current voucher is (l1, ...) and we require l2>=l1+d1. Since l1+d1 > l1 (because d1>=1), the current voucher does not qualify. So we are safe.\n\n        However, what if we have two different vouchers with the same (l, r, cost)? Then they are distinct and non-overlapping? No, they are identical and hence overlapping. But wait: two identical intervals are not disjoint. \n\n        Therefore, the problem states: two vouchers i and j (i≠j). The condition is non-intersection. Two identical intervals (same [l, r]) are not disjoint. So we must not use two identical intervals.\n\n        But note: our method does not explicitly exclude the same voucher (by index) because we are storing by duration and then by l. However, if there are two identical intervals (same l, same r, same cost) then they are two distinct entries in the list for that duration. But the condition for non-intersection fails. \n\n        How does our method handle two identical intervals? \n\n            For Case 1: \n                We have two identical intervals: (l, r) = (l0, l0+d1-1). \n                Condition: l2 >= l0+d1. \n                But the two intervals have l0, which is < l0+d1 (since d1>=1). So they do not satisfy the condition.\n\n            So even though we have two identical intervals, they won't be chosen together.\n\n        Therefore, the method is safe.\n\n 13. Implementation details:\n\n        We'll create:\n\n            groups = defaultdict(list)   # key: duration, value: list of (l, cost)\n\n        Then, for each voucher (li, ri, costi):\n            d = ri - li + 1\n            groups[d].append( (li, costi) )\n\n        Then, we precompute for each duration d that exists:\n\n            If groups[d] is not empty, then:\n                sort groups[d] by l (the start day)\n                Then, create an array of the l's and an array min_costs from the back.\n\n                Specifically, let arr = sorted(groups[d], key=lambda x: x[0])\n                Then, let min_arr = [0]*len(arr)\n                min_val = float('inf')\n                for i in range(len(arr)-1, -1, -1):\n                    min_val = min(min_val, arr[i][1])\n                    min_arr[i] = min_val\n\n                Then, we can store for duration d:\n                    sorted_list[d] = arr   # sorted by l\n                    min_cost_arr[d] = min_arr   # the minimal cost from index i to the end\n\n            Then, we define a helper function to query a duration d for a given minimal_start:\n\n                def query_min_cost(d, min_start):\n                    # We want the minimal cost for any voucher in groups[d] with l >= min_start.\n                    arr = sorted_list.get(d, [])\n                    if not arr:\n                        return float('inf')\n                    # Find the first index in arr where the l >= min_start.\n                    # arr is sorted by l, so we can use bisect_left\n                    import bisect\n                    idx = bisect.bisect_left(arr, (min_start, 0))   # arr is list of (l, cost), so we compare by l first.\n                    if idx >= len(arr):\n                        return float('inf')\n                    return min_cost_arr[d][idx]\n\n            However, note: the array 'arr' is sorted by l, and we stored the minimal cost from that index to the end.\n\n        Then, we iterate over the distinct durations:\n\n            ans = float('inf')\n\n            for d1 in groups.keys():\n                d2 = x - d1\n                if d2 not in groups:\n                    continue\n\n                # Case 1: d1 then d2\n                for (l1, cost1) in groups[d1]:\n                    min_start2 = l1 + d1   # because the next voucher must start at least at l1+d1\n                    if min_start2 > 200000:   # since the maximum day is 200000, we can skip if too high.\n                        # But note: the condition is l2 >= min_start2, and if min_start2 is beyond the maximum l (which is 200000) then there is no voucher.\n                        # We can skip.\n                        continue\n                    cost2 = query_min_cost(d2, min_start2)\n                    if cost2 != float('inf'):\n                        total_cost = cost1 + cost2\n                        if total_cost < ans:\n                            ans = total_cost\n\n                # Case 2: d2 then d1\n                for (l2, cost2) in groups[d2]:\n                    min_start1 = l2 + d2\n                    if min_start1 > 200000:\n                        continue\n                    cost1_val = query_min_cost(d1, min_start1)\n                    if cost1_val != float('inf'):\n                        total_cost = cost2 + cost1_val\n                        if total_cost < ans:\n                            ans = total_cost\n\n            Then, if ans is still inf, output -1, else output ans.\n\n        However, note: the above loops iterate over each distinct d1 (that has a matching d2) and then over all vouchers in d1 and d2. The total work is O(n) per distinct d1? Actually, the total work is O(|groups[d1]| + |groups[d2]|) for each distinct d1. But note: the same group might be reused multiple times (if there are multiple d1 such that d2=x-d1 is the same). \n\n        Example: if x=10, then d1=3 and d2=7; and d1=7 and d2=3 are two different iterations. So the same group (say for d=3) is used in two different iterations (when d1=3 and d2=7, and when d1=7 and d2=3). \n\n        But note: the total number of distinct d1 is at most the number of distinct durations that are <=x-1 and for which x-d1 is also present. The total work is the sum_{d1 in S} (|groups[d1]| + |groups[x-d1]|) where S is the set of durations that are present and for which x-d1 is present.\n\n        Since the total number of vouchers is n, the sum of |groups[d]| for all d is n. But we are summing each group twice (once as d1 and once as d2) if d1 != d2, and once if d1==d2 (but then d1=d2 and x=2*d1, and then we use the group for d1 twice in the same iteration). \n\n        Actually, in the iteration for d1, we use groups[d1] and groups[d2] (with d2=x-d1). Then, in the iteration for d2 (if d2 is distinct from d1) we will use groups[d2] and groups[d1] again. So we are processing each group twice.\n\n        Therefore, the total work is 2 * (sum_{d in S} |groups[d]|) which is at most 2*n.\n\n        But note: the query_min_cost function does a binary search (O(log |groups[d]|)) for each voucher. So the total work is O(n * log(n)).\n\n        However, note: the same group is queried multiple times (for example, the group for d1 is queried for each voucher in d2 (in Case 2) and the group for d2 is queried for each voucher in d1 (in Case 1)). And the total number of queries is the sum_{d1} (|groups[d1]| + |groups[d2]|) which is <= 2*n.\n\n        So the overall complexity is O(n log n).\n\n 14. But wait: we are iterating over distinct d1, and the distinct d1 are the keys that are in the groups and for which x-d1 is in the groups. The total number of distinct d1 is at most the number of distinct durations, which is <= 200000. But the inner loops are over the entire groups[d1] and groups[d2]. \n\n        However, we are not iterating over distinct d1 one by one and then over all vouchers in d1 and d2. We are iterating over each distinct d1 (that satisfies the condition) and then for each voucher in d1 and d2. The total number of distinct d1 is at most 200000, but the total number of vouchers is 200000, so the worst-case is if we have 200000 distinct durations, then each group has 1 voucher. Then the total work is 200000 * (1+1) * log(1) = 400000, which is acceptable.\n\n        But if we have fewer distinct durations, then the groups are larger.\n\n        However, the worst-case is when we have many vouchers in the same duration. But the total number of vouchers is 200000, so the worst-case for a single duration is 200000. Then, if x is even, and we have two durations d and x-d, and d=x/2, then we are processing two groups of size 100000 (if split evenly). Then the inner loop for that d1 (which is d) will do 100000 lookups (each a binary search in the other group of 100000). The binary search in a group of 100000 is O(log(100000)) which is about 17 comparisons.",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two distinct travel vouchers such that the sum of their durations equals exactly `x` (the total vacation days), and they do not overlap in time. The goal is to minimize the total cost of these two vouchers. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. Each voucher is characterized by its start day (`l`), end day (`r`), and cost. The duration of a voucher is calculated as `r - l + 1`.\n\n2. **Preprocess for Efficient Queries**: For each duration group, we sort the vouchers by their start day (`l`). Then, we preprocess each sorted list to quickly find the minimum cost voucher that starts at or after a given day. This is done by maintaining a suffix minimum array during the sorting step.\n\n3. **Check Valid Pairs**: For each possible duration `d1`, we check if there exists a complementary duration `d2 = x - d1`. For each voucher in `d1`, we determine the earliest start day required for a voucher in `d2` to ensure they do not overlap (i.e., the end of `d1`'s voucher must be before the start of `d2`'s voucher). Using the preprocessed data, we efficiently find the minimum cost voucher in `d2` that meets this condition. We repeat this process for the reverse scenario (ensuring `d2`'s voucher ends before `d1`'s starts).\n\n4. **Track Minimum Cost**: Throughout the checks, we keep track of the minimum total cost encountered. If no valid pair is found, we return -1; otherwise, we return the minimum cost.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n        \n    it = iter(data)\n    n = int(next(it)); x = int(next(it))\n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(next(it)); ri = int(next(it)); costi = int(next(it))\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, costi))\n    \n    groups = defaultdict(list)\n    for (li, ri, costi) in vouchers:\n        d = ri - li + 1\n        groups[d].append((li, costi))\n        \n    sorted_list = {}\n    min_cost_arr = {}\n    \n    for d, lst in groups.items():\n        arr = sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        sorted_list[d] = arr\n        min_val = float('inf')\n        min_arr = [0] * len(arr)\n        for i in range(len(arr)-1, -1, -1):\n            min_val = min(min_val, arr[i][1])\n            min_arr[i] = min_val\n        min_cost_arr[d] = min_arr\n        \n    def query_min_cost(d, min_start):\n        if d not in sorted_list:\n            return float('inf')\n        arr = sorted_list[d]\n        if not arr:\n            return float('inf')\n        pos = bisect.bisect_left(arr, (min_start, 0))\n        if pos >= len(arr):\n            return float('inf')\n        return min_cost_arr[d][pos]\n        \n    ans = float('inf')\n    keys = list(groups.keys())\n    for d1 in keys:\n        d2 = x - d1\n        if d2 not in groups:\n            continue\n            \n        for (l1, cost1) in groups[d1]:\n            min_start2 = l1 + d1\n            if min_start2 > 200000:\n                continue\n            cost2 = query_min_cost(d2, min_start2)\n            if cost2 == float('inf'):\n                continue\n            total = cost1 + cost2\n            if total < ans:\n                ans = total\n                \n        for (l2, cost2) in groups[d2]:\n            min_start1 = l2 + d2\n            if min_start1 > 200000:\n                continue\n            cost1_val = query_min_cost(d1, min_start1)\n            if cost1_val == float('inf'):\n                continue\n            total = cost2 + cost1_val\n            if total < ans:\n                ans = total\n                \n    print(-1 if ans == float('inf') else ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of vouchers `n` and the total vacation days `x`, followed by the details of each voucher.\n2. **Grouping Vouchers**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration (calculated as `r - l + 1`). Each group contains tuples of `(start_day, cost)`.\n3. **Sorting and Preprocessing**: For each duration group, the vouchers are sorted by their start day. A suffix minimum array is constructed to allow quick lookup of the minimum cost voucher starting from any given day.\n4. **Query Handling**: The `query_min_cost` function uses binary search to find the first voucher in a duration group that starts at or after a specified day and returns the minimum cost from that point onward.\n5. **Finding Valid Pairs**: For each duration `d1`, the complementary duration `d2 = x - d1` is checked. For each voucher in `d1`, the function checks if there exists a voucher in `d2` that starts after the current voucher ends. The same check is performed in reverse (for `d2`'s vouchers).\n6. **Result Calculation**: The minimum total cost of valid pairs is tracked. If no valid pairs are found, -1 is printed; otherwise, the minimum cost is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using grouping and preprocessing, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
