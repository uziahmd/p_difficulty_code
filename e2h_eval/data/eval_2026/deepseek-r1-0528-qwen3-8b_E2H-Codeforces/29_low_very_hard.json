Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the problem requires processing multiple substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the number modulo 1000000007.\n\n However, note that the total length of all replacement strings (ti) is at most 10^5, but the initial string can be up to 10^5 and there can be up to 10^5 queries. Also, the same digit might be replaced multiple times, and the replacements can be recursive in effect (though the problem states the queries are performed in order, so we do one after another).\n\n But note: if we do the naive approach, we would replace each occurrence of a digit one by one. However, if we have a long string and many queries, and especially if a replacement string contains the digit being replaced again, then we might get an exponential blowup.\n\n Example: \n   Start with \"2\", then query \"2->02\", then \"0->0\", then \"2->02\" again.\n   After first query: \"02\"\n   Then second: \"00\" (because 0 becomes empty? Actually the example says: \"3->\" meaning remove 3, so if we have a query for '0' to empty, then \"02\" becomes \"\" for the zeros and then the two becomes ... wait, but actually the example input:\n\n   Input: \n     ['222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n   Output:\n     ['777', '1']\n\n   So the third sample: \n        s = \"222\", n=2, queries: \"2->0\", then \"0->7\"\n        First: replace all '2' with '0' -> \"000\"\n        Second: replace all '0' with '7' -> \"777\"\n\n However, consider a more complex example: \n        s = \"2\"\n        Query1: \"2->02\"\n        Query2: \"0->0\"\n\n        Then we have: \n            Initially: \"2\"\n            After Query1: \"02\"\n            After Query2: Replace every '0' in \"02\" with \"0\", so we get \"02\" (no change) because the replacement for '0' is \"0\", so it remains.\n\n But what if we have:\n        s = \"2\"\n        Query1: \"2->02\"\n        Query2: \"0->20\"\n\n        Then:\n            Step1: \"2\" becomes \"02\"\n            Step2: replace '0' in \"02\" with \"20\": so \"02\" becomes \"202\"\n\n        Now, if we have a third query: \"2->02\", then we have to replace every '2' in \"202\" with \"02\": \n            becomes \"00202\"\n\n        This can lead to an explosion of the string length.\n\n Since the total length of all ti's is at most 10^5, we cannot do a naive string replacement (which would be O(|s| * (number of replacements)) because the string might become too long.\n\n Alternative approach: We need to process the queries in reverse order? Or use dynamic programming to compute the value of the entire string without expanding it?\n\n Observation: The problem asks for the number modulo 1000000007. We can compute the number from left to right, but the issue is that the substitutions can change the entire string.\n\n However, note: the operations are applied in sequence. We can think of the entire transformation as: \n   Start with s0 = s\n   Then s1 = apply all queries in order\n\n But the string might become huge.\n\n Another idea: Instead of building the entire string, we can keep track of the value of the current string modulo 1000000007, but the problem is that the substitutions can insert arbitrary digits and change the length, so we must account for the power of 10 at each position.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the idea of processing the queries backwards and use DP to compute the final value for each digit.\n\n Let f(d) be the final string that the digit d becomes after all the queries.\n\n Then, we can start from the last query and go backwards, updating the transformation for each digit.\n\n However, note: the queries are given in the order they are applied. So if we process the queries from last to first, then we can update the transformation for the digits that are replaced in later queries.\n\n Steps:\n\n  1. We'll read the initial string s and the queries.\n\n  2. We'll create an array (or dictionary) `trans` for each digit (from '0' to '9') that maps the digit to a string. Initially, for each",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a series of substitution queries on an initial string of digits and then compute the resulting number modulo 1000000007. The challenge lies in efficiently handling the substitutions without explicitly expanding the string, especially since repeated substitutions can lead to exponentially large strings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reverse Processing of Queries**: Instead of processing each query in the given order (which could lead to inefficient string expansions), we process the queries in reverse order. This allows us to determine the final transformation for each digit by considering the effect of subsequent queries first.\n2. **Digit Transformation Tracking**: For each digit from '0' to '9', maintain a string representing its final form after all applicable substitutions. Initially, each digit maps to itself. As we process each query in reverse, update the transformations for digits that are replaced by other digits or strings.\n3. **Efficient Number Calculation**: After determining the final transformation for each digit, compute the resulting number by processing each character in the original string. For each character, use its transformed string to update the result, accounting for the positional value (modulo 1000000007) during the computation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 1000000007\n\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        queries.append(input().strip())\n    \n    trans = {str(i): str(i) for i in range(10)}\n    \n    for q in reversed(queries):\n        parts = q.split('->')\n        if len(parts) < 2:\n            continue\n        old_digit = parts[0][0]\n        new_str = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n        \n        current_trans = trans[old_digit]\n        updated = False\n        \n        for char in new_str:\n            if char in trans:\n                current_trans += trans[char]\n                updated = True\n        if not updated:\n            current_trans = new_str\n            \n        trans[old_digit] = current_trans\n\n    result = 0\n    power = 1\n    for char in s:\n        t_str = trans[char]\n        num_val = 0\n        for c in t_str:\n            num_val = (num_val * 10 + ord(c) - ord('0')) % MOD\n        result = (result * (len(t_str)) + num_val) % MOD\n        \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The initial string and the number of queries are read from standard input. Each query is stored in a list.\n2. **Initial Setup**: A dictionary `trans` is initialized where each digit maps to itself. This dictionary will store the final transformation for each digit after processing all queries.\n3. **Reverse Query Processing**: By processing queries in reverse order, each digit's transformation is updated to reflect all subsequent substitutions. For example, if a digit '2' is replaced by '0' in a later query, the earlier query replacing '2' with a string containing '0' will be adjusted to include the final form of '0'.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The original string is processed character by character. For each character, its transformed string is computed. The result is built by treating each transformed substring as part of the decimal number, updating the result modulo 1000000007 at each step to prevent overflow.\n5. **Output**: The final result is printed, which is the remainder of the resulting number divided by 1000000007.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the substitutions without explicitly expanding the string, leveraging reverse processing and modular arithmetic to manage large numbers.",
