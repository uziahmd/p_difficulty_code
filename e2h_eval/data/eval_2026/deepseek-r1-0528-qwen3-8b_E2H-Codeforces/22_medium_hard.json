After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m in the first line, then n lines of m characters (without spaces)\n We have to count the number of successful students. A student is successful if there exists at least one subject in which he is the best.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input.\n 2. For each subject, find the maximum mark (since best means highest mark for that subject).\n 3. Then for each student, check for any subject where his mark is equal to the maximum mark for that subject (and note: if multiple students have the same max mark, they are all considered best for that subject).\n\n However, note: The problem says \"best\" if there is no student with a higher mark. So if two students have the same highest mark, then both are best for that subject.\n\n But note: a student can be successful if in at least one subject he is best (i.e., has the maximum mark for that subject). \n\n Approach:\n Let's break down the data. We have a grid of n rows (students) and m columns (subjects).\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n\n   We have 3 students and 3 subjects.\n\n   Represent the grid as:\n        student0: ['2','2','3']\n        student1: ['2','3','2']\n        student2: ['1','1','2']\n\n   For subject0: marks = ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2' (so student0 and student1 are best for subject0)\n   For subject1: marks = ['2','3','1'] -> max is '3' (so only student1 is best for subject1)\n   For subject2: marks = ['3','2','2'] -> max is '3' (so only student0 is best for subject2)\n\n   Now, we want to know for each student if they are best in at least one subject.\n\n   Student0: subject0 and subject2 -> successful.\n   Student1: subject0 and subject1 -> successful.\n   Student2: none -> not successful.\n\n   Therefore, answer is 2.\n\n Implementation:\n\n Step 1: Parse the input.\n   First line: n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   Then, read n lines.\n\n Step 2: Create a list for the grid.\n\n Step 3: For each subject j (from 0 to m-1), find the maximum mark (as a character) in that column.\n\n Step 4: For each student i, check if there exists at least one subject j such that grid[i][j] == max_mark[j].\n\n However, note: the marks are characters, so we can compare by character (since '9' > '1').\n\n But wait: what if there are multiple maximums? That's handled naturally because we just check equality to the max.\n\n But note: the max_mark for a subject is the highest character in that column.\n\n Example: \n   subject0: ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2'\n\n Step 5: Count the number of students for which the condition holds.\n\n However, note: the example input might be provided as a string in a list. But the problem says:\n   Input: \n        ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n But actually, the input is from standard input. We should read from stdin.\n\n Let me assume the input is given as:\n\n   Example 1: \n        3 3\n        223\n        232\n        112\n\n   Example 2:\n        3 5\n        91728\n        11828\n        11111\n\n But note: the example input is given as a list of strings in the problem statement. However, the problem says \"The first input line\", so we read from stdin.\n\n Code:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   grid = []\n   for i in range(n):\n        s = input().strip()\n        # Each s is a string of m characters\n        grid.append(s)\n\n   Then, for j in range(m):\n        col = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n        max_in_col = max(col)   # This gives the maximum character in the column\n\n   Then, we can create a list `max_marks` for each column.\n\n   Then, for each student i, we check for any j: grid[i][j] == max_marks[j]\n\n   But note: we don't need to store the entire max_marks per column if we do it without building an intermediate list?\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   Let's create a list `col_max` of length m, where col_max[j] is the maximum mark in column j.\n\n   Then, for each student i (each row), we can check for any j in range(m): if grid[i][j] == col_max[j] then mark this student as successful and break inner loop.\n\n   However, we can also use:\n\n   successful = [False] * n\n\n   for j in range(m):\n        max_char = col_max[j]\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][j] == max_char:\n                successful[i] = True   # But wait, this would mark a student as successful if they are best in at least one subject, but we don't want to set to True multiple times, so we can break out once we set one True.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   successful = [False] * n\n   for j in range(m):\n        max_char = col_max[j]\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][j] == max_char:\n                successful[i] = True   # This is okay because we are setting True for each subject they are best, but we don't need to set multiple times.\n\n   Then, the answer is the count of True in successful.\n\n   But wait: what if a student is best in two subjects? We set True for each occurrence, but that's okay because we only care if at least one is True.\n\n   However, let me consider: we set successful[i] = True for every subject j where student i is best. But if we break early, we can avoid unnecessary iterations.\n\n   We can do:\n\n   successful = [False] * n\n   for j in range(m):\n        max_char = col_max[j]\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][j] == max_char:\n                successful[i] = True   # This is acceptable, but we are not breaking after setting one student to True because the same student may appear again in the same column? Actually, in one column, if a student appears twice, but wait: a student is represented by one row, so in a fixed column j, we are iterating over each row (student) once.\n\n   However, we can optimize by checking for each student: once we set successful[i] to True, we don't need to check other columns for that student? Actually, no. Because we are processing column by column, and we want to know if there's at least one column where the student is best. But if we set successful[i] to True in one column, we can remember that and not check the rest? But the problem requires checking all columns for at least one. However, we can break the inner loop for a student once we set it to True? But we are processing by columns, so we cannot break the outer loop.\n\n   Alternatively, we can process row by row:\n\n   Another approach: For each student, we can check for each subject if they are the best in that subject. But that would require knowing the maximum of the subject.\n\n   But note: we have to compute the maximum for each subject first.\n\n   Let me stick to the first method.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n   # Build col_max: list of m elements, each element is the maximum in the column.\n   col_max = []\n   for j in range(m):\n        col = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n        col_max.append(max(col))\n\n   successful = [False] * n\n   for j in range(m):\n        max_char = col_max[j]\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][j] == max_char:\n                successful[i] = True\n\n   print(sum(successful))\n\n   Let me test with the first sample:\n\n        grid = ['223', '232', '112']\n        n=3, m=3\n\n        col0: ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2'\n        col1: ['2','3','1'] -> max is '3'\n        col2: ['3','2','2'] -> max is '3'\n\n        Then, for j=0: set successful[0] and successful[1] to True.\n        for j=1: set successful[1] to True (already True, no change).\n        for j=2: set successful[0] to True (already True).\n\n        successful = [True, True, False] -> count=2 -> correct.\n\n   Second sample:\n\n        Input: \n          3 5\n          91728\n          11828\n          11111\n\n        grid = ['91728', '11828', '11111']\n\n        Columns:\n\n        col0: ['9','1','1'] -> max='9'\n        col1: ['1','1','1'] -> max='1'\n        col2: ['7','8','1'] -> max='8'\n        col3: ['2','2','1'] -> max='2'\n        col4: ['8','8','1'] -> max='8'\n\n        Now, for each student:\n\n        Student0: '91728'\n          col0: '9' == '9' -> True\n          col1: '1' == '1' -> True\n          col2: '7' != '8' -> skip\n          col3: '2' == '2' -> True\n          col4: '8' == '8' -> True -> but we don't need to check further, but our code doesn't break early.\n\n        However, we don't break early, so we set successful[0] to True because of col0, then True from col1, then col3, then col4. But we are just setting to True repeatedly.\n\n        Student1: '11828'\n          col0: '1' != '9' -> skip\n          col1: '1' == '1' -> True\n          col2: '8' == '8' -> True\n          col3: '2' == '2' -> True\n          col4: '8' == '8' -> True\n\n        Student2: '11111'\n          col0: '1' != '9' -> skip\n          col1: '1' == '1' -> True (so successful[2] becomes True)\n          ... but wait, the expected output is 3.\n\n        So indeed, student2 is successful because in subject1 (index1) he has the max mark (which is '1').\n\n        Therefore, our code returns 3.\n\n   But note: the example input is provided as a string in a list, but we are reading from stdin. The problem says the input is from standard input.\n\n   However, note: the input might have spaces? The problem says: \"The first input line contains two integers n and m\", then n lines of m characters.\n\n   We are using input().strip() for each row, so that's safe.\n\n   But wait: the example input is given as a string that includes the numbers and then the next lines. Our code reads the first line, then the next three lines.\n\n   One more edge case: n=1, m=1.\n\n        Input: \n          1 1\n          1\n\n        col0: ['1'] -> max='1'\n        Then, for student0: check column0: '1'=='1' -> True, so successful count=1.\n\n   Another edge: n=1, m=2\n        Input:\n          1 2\n          12\n\n        col0: ['1'] -> max='1'\n        col1: ['2'] -> max='2'\n\n        Student0: \n            col0: '1'=='1' -> True\n            col1: '2'=='2' -> True\n        So successful.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, note: what if there is a subject with multiple maximums? We are already handling that.\n\n   Code:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   grid = []\n   for i in range(n):\n        grid.append(input().strip())\n\n   # If there are no subjects (m==0) then we have to handle differently? But n, m>=1 per problem.\n\n   col_max = [max([grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]) for j in range(m)]\n\n   successful = [False] * n\n   for j in range(m):\n        max_char = col_max[j]\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][j] == max_char:\n                successful[i] = True\n\n   print(sum(successful))\n\n   But note: we can also do without building col_max first by doing:\n\n   Instead, we can iterate over columns and update the successful array as above.\n\n   This code is O(n*m) which is acceptable since n, m <= 100.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input might be given as a list of strings in the example, but that is just for illustration.\n\n   We are reading from stdin.\n\n   But wait: the example input format is:\n\n        ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n   This is two examples. But in competitive programming, we only get one input. So we assume one input.\n\n   However, the problem says \"Input\" and then the example. We are to read one input.\n\n   We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n   Let me submit the code.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Print the single number\", so we output an integer.\n\n   Final code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m) from the first line of input. Then, read the next n lines, each containing m characters representing the marks of each student in all subjects.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject, find the highest mark achieved by any student. This involves iterating through each column (subject) of the grid and identifying the maximum value in that column.\n3. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, mark them as successful.\n4. **Count Successful Students**: The total number of successful students is the count of those marked as successful in the previous step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    n, m = map(int, data[0].split())\n    grid = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        grid.append(data[i].strip())\n    \n    col_max = [max([grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]) for j in range(m)]\n    \n    successful = [False] * n\n    for j in range(m):\n        max_char = col_max[j]\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][j] == max_char:\n                successful[i] = True\n                \n    print(sum(successful))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The code reads all input lines at once and splits them into a list. The first line contains the integers n (number of students) and m (number of subjects). The subsequent lines contain the marks for each student.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), the code determines the highest mark by examining all entries in that column across all students.\n3. **Checking Successful Students**: For each student, the code checks if their mark in any subject matches the highest mark for that subject. If it does, the student is marked as successful.\n4. **Output Result**: The total number of successful students is printed, which is the sum of all `True` values in the `successful` list.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects and counts those who excel in at least one subject, providing the desired result.",
