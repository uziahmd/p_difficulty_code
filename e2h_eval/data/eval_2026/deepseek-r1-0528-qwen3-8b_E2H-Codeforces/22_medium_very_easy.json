After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are reading the first line to get n and m.\n Then, we read the next n lines, each containing a string of m characters (without spaces).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We'll read the input as described.\n 2. For each subject (column), we can determine the maximum mark (from '1' to '9') for that subject.\n 3. However, note: being best at a subject means having the highest mark in that subject. But there might be multiple students with the same highest mark? \n    The problem says: \"Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\"\n    So if two or more students have the same highest mark, then all of them are considered best for that subject.\n\n 4. Now, a student is successful if there exists at least one subject in which he is the best.\n\n However, note: we cannot simply check for each student if they have the maximum mark in every subject? \n\n Alternate approach:\n   - For each subject j, let max_j = maximum mark in that subject (as a character, but we can compare by converting to int or just use string since '1'<'2' etc.)\n   - Then, for each student i, we check for at least one subject j such that the mark of student i in subject j is equal to max_j.\n\n But wait: what if there are multiple subjects? We need to know for each student if there is at least one subject where they have the maximum.\n\n However, note: it's possible that a student is not the best in any subject even if in one subject they have the maximum? Actually, no: if in a subject j, the student has the maximum mark, then they are best in that subject.\n\n Therefore, we can do:\n\n   Let `grid` be a list of strings, each string is a row (student) and each character is a mark in that subject.\n\n   Step 1: Precompute the maximum mark for each subject (each column). Since marks are from '1' to '9', we can use the max function on each column.\n\n   Step 2: For each student (each row), check if there exists at least one column j such that grid[i][j] == max_marks[j]\n\n Example: \n   Input: ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112'] -> n=3, m=3, grid = ['223','232','112']\n\n   Columns: \n        col0: ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2'\n        col1: ['2','3','1'] -> max is '3'\n        col2: ['3','2','2'] -> max is '3'\n\n   Now, for student0 ('223'):\n        col0: '2' == '2' -> successful.\n        So we don't need to check others.\n\n   Student1 ('232'):\n        col0: '2' == '2' -> successful.\n\n   Student2 ('112'):\n        col0: '1' != '2'\n        col1: '1' != '3'\n        col2: '2' != '3' -> not successful.\n\n   So output 2.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Read the first line: \n        data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n        n = int(data[0]); m = int(data[1])\n\n   Then, read the next n lines.\n\n   Alternatively, we can read the entire input and split by newline.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        import sys\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        first_line = data[0].split()\n        n = int(first_line[0])\n        m = int(first_line[1])\n\n        grid = []\n        for i in range(1, 1+n):\n            grid.append(data[i].strip())\n\n   Then, compute max_marks for each column j (from 0 to m-1):\n\n        max_marks = [None] * m\n        for j in range(m):\n            col = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n            max_marks[j] = max(col)\n\n   Then, for each student (row) i, check:\n\n        successful = False\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grid[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                successful = True\n                break\n\n        If successful, count this student.\n\n   Print the count.\n\n But note: the example input format is given as a string that includes the numbers. However, the sample input is provided as:\n\n        ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n   But actually, the input is coming from stdin. So we don't know if it's one string or multiple.\n\n   Actually, the problem says: the first input line contains two integers, then n lines.\n\n   We can read as:\n\n        import sys\n\n        lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        if not lines: \n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n\n        n, m = map(int, lines[0].split())\n        grid = []\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            grid.append(lines[i].strip())\n\n   However, the sample input is provided as two separate examples. In the actual competition, the input would be one of these.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Next n lines\", so we assume exactly n lines after the first.\n\n   Let's test with the second example:\n\n        Input: \"3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111\"\n\n        n=3, m=5\n        grid = ['91728','11828','11111']\n\n        Columns:\n            col0: ['9','1','1'] -> max '9'\n            col1: ['1','1','1'] -> max '1'\n            col2: ['7','8','1'] -> max '8'\n            col3: ['2','2','1'] -> max '2'\n            col4: ['8','8','1'] -> max '8'\n\n        Now, check each student:\n\n        Student0: '91728'\n            col0: '9' == '9' -> successful.\n\n        Student1: '11828'\n            col0: '1' != '9'\n            col1: '1' == '1' -> successful.\n\n        Student2: '11111'\n            col0: '1' != '9'\n            col1: '1' == '1' -> successful.\n\n        So all three are successful -> output 3.\n\n   This matches the sample.\n\n   Code:\n\n        import sys\n\n        def main():\n            data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n            if not data:\n                print(0)\n                return\n\n            first_line = data[0].split()\n            n = int(first_line[0])\n            m = int(first_line[1])\n\n            # Read the next n lines\n            grid = []\n            for i in range(1, 1+n):\n                # Each line should be a string without spaces\n                s = data[i].strip()\n                if len(s) != m:\n                    # It's possible that the line has extra spaces? The problem says no, but just in case.\n                    # But the problem says: \"Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9\"\n                    # So we take the first m characters? Or the whole line?\n                    # The problem says: \"Next n lines each containing m characters\"\n                    # So we assume the line has exactly m characters (without spaces). But the example input doesn't have spaces.\n                    # If there are spaces, we strip and then take the first m? Actually, the problem says \"not separated by spaces\", so we expect a string of m digits.\n                    # Let's just take the first m non-whitespace characters. But the problem says no spaces, so we can use the entire stripped string.\n                    pass  # We already did strip, so if the line has less than m, then we have an issue.\n\n                grid.append(s[:m])  # This ensures we take exactly m characters.\n\n            # Now, compute the maximum for each column j\n            max_marks = []\n            for j in range(m):\n                col = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n                max_marks.append(max(col))\n\n            count = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(m):\n                    if grid[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                        count += 1\n                        break   # No need to check other columns for this student\n\n            print(count)\n\n        if __name__ == '__main__':\n            main()\n\n However, note: the grid might have been read correctly from the input. Also, the problem constraints are small (n, m <= 100), so the double loop is acceptable.\n\n Let's run the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n        Input: \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n\n        n=3, m=3\n        grid = ['223', '232', '112']\n\n        max_marks for column0: max('2','2','1') -> '2'\n        column1: max('2','3','1') -> '3'\n        column2: max('3','2','2') -> '3'\n\n        Check student0: \n            '2' == '2' -> count becomes 1, break inner loop.\n        student1:\n            '2' == '2' -> count becomes 2, break.\n        student2:\n            '1' != '2', '1' != '3', '2' != '3' -> no, so count remains 2.\n\n Example 2: \n        Input: \"3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111\"\n\n        As above, count becomes 3.\n\n But wait: the example input is provided as a string that includes two examples? Actually, the example input is given as:\n\n        Input: \n            ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n        But in the problem statement, it's two separate examples. Our code reads from stdin.\n\n        However, when testing, we can provide the input as:\n\n            echo -e \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\" | python3 solution.py\n\n        And similarly for the second.\n\n   This should work.\n\n   One more edge: what if there is only one student? Then he must be the best in every subject? So he is successful.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: \"1 1\\n5\"\n\n        n=1, m=1, grid=['5']\n        max_marks = ['5']\n        Then check: grid[0][0]=='5' -> count=1.\n\n   Another edge: multiple students with same maximum in a subject.\n\n        Example: \n            Input: \"2 1\\n9\\n9\"\n\n            Two students, one subject. Both have 9.\n\n            max_marks = ['9']\n\n            Student0: '9' == '9' -> successful.\n            Student1: '9' == '9' -> successful.\n\n            Output: 2.\n\n   This is correct because the definition says: \"there is no student who got a higher mark\". In this case, both are best (since no one has a higher mark).\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the first line to get the number of students (n) and subjects (m). Then read the next n lines, each containing m characters representing the marks of a student across all subjects.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject, find the highest mark achieved by any student in the group. This involves examining each column (subject) of the grid formed by the student marks.\n3. **Check Student Success**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, they are counted as successful. The check can be done by comparing each student's marks against the precomputed maximum marks for each subject.\n4. **Output the Result**: Print the total count of successful students.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    n = int(first_line[0])\n    m = int(first_line[1])\n    \n    grid = []\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        s = data[i].strip()\n        grid.append(s[:m])\n    \n    max_marks = []\n    for j in range(m):\n        col = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n        max_marks.append(max(col))\n        \n    count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grid[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                count += 1\n                break\n                \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads all input lines at once and splits them into a list. The first line contains the dimensions n (number of students) and m (number of subjects). The subsequent lines contain the marks for each student.\n2. **Grid Construction**: The marks for each student are stored in a list of strings, ensuring each string has exactly m characters (padding or truncating if necessary).\n3. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), the highest mark is determined by examining all student entries in that column.\n4. **Success Check**: Each student is checked against these maximum marks. If a student has the highest mark in any subject, they are counted as successful, and the loop moves to the next student immediately (using `break` for efficiency).\n5. **Output**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects, leveraging precomputed maximum values to minimize redundant comparisons, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
