She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n We need to leave only the tabs from l to r. Initially, all tabs from 1 to n are open.\n\n There are two types of operations:\n  1. Move the cursor: either left (to max(current - 1, a)) or right (to min(current + 1, b)), where a and b are the current minimum and maximum tab indices (which change as we close tabs).\n  2. Close all tabs to the left (so that the new a becomes i) or to the right (so that the new b becomes i).\n\n However, note that after closing some tabs, the boundaries a and b change.\n\n But note: we are allowed to close only when the cursor is at a certain tab. And the closure operation sets the boundary to the cursor's position for that side.\n\n The goal is to minimize the number of seconds.\n\n Observation:\n We have to close two parts: \n   - All tabs with index < l (if any)\n   - All tabs with index > r (if any)\n\n However, note that sometimes we can do both in one go if we can move the cursor and then close one side, but also we might need to adjust the cursor position.\n\n Steps:\n\n Case 1: If the entire set of tabs is already [l, r] (i.e., l == 1 and r == n, but actually we want the segment [l, r] to be exactly what remains, and initially we have [1, n]), then we don't need to do anything. However, note that the problem says \"leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r\", so if the current set is [l, r] then we are done.\n\n Actually, the condition for no operation is: if the current set of tabs is [l, r]. But initially, we have [1, n]. So we must close everything outside [l, r].\n\n However, note: the input gives n, pos, l, r.\n\n We can consider:\n\n  Option 1: Only need to close the left part (if l > 1) and/or the right part (if r < n).\n\n We can break down the problem:\n\n  Let left_required = (l > 1)   [meaning there are tabs to the left of l to close]\n  Let right_required = (r < n)   [meaning there are tabs to the right of r to close]\n\n But note: we start at pos, and we might not be at the boundaries.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Since the operations are independent on the left and right, but the cursor movement and closure operations might be interleaved, we can think of two main strategies:\n\n Strategy 1: Close the left part first, then the right part.\n Strategy 2: Close the right part first, then the left part.\n\n However, we might also consider moving the cursor to a specific point and then closing.\n\n But note: when we close one side, the boundaries change and the cursor remains at the same place (unless we move it). Also, after closing one side, we might have to move the cursor again to close the other side.\n\n Let's define:\n\n  To close the left part (tabs from 1 to l-1), we must have the cursor at a tab >= l (because if we are at a tab < l, then the left closure would also close some of the required tabs). Actually, we can close the left part only if we are at a tab that is >= l. Similarly, to close the right part, we must be at a tab <= r.\n\n Therefore, we must get the cursor to a position that allows us to close the left part (at least l) and similarly for the right part.\n\n However, note: we can do multiple moves and closures. But observe that we can only close one contiguous part per closure operation.\n\n Another idea:\n\n We have two operations that can be performed independently (closing left and closing right). But we must ensure that we don't close required tabs.\n\n The key is that we can only close the left part if we are at a tab that is currently the rightmost tab (or more precisely, we can close the left part from any tab that is greater than or equal to l, but note: the closure operation will close all from the current left boundary to i-1. However, the current left boundary is determined by the state. \n\n Actually, the problem states: \n   - Close all the tabs to the left: this sets the left boundary to i (the current tab). So we must be at a tab i such that we want to set the left boundary to i (so that no tab to the left of i remains). But note: we want to leave only [l, r]. So we want the left boundary to be l (meaning we close from 1 to l-1). Therefore, to close the left part, we must be at a tab i >= l, and then we close the left part. Similarly, to close the right part, we must be at a tab i <= r.\n\n Therefore, we must eventually have the cursor at a tab in [l, r] to close the left part? Not necessarily: we can close the left part from a tab that is >= l, and then the left boundary becomes that tab. Then to close the right part, we must be at a tab <= r (which might be different). \n\n Steps:\n\n  Let's assume we have two closures: one for the left and one for the right.\n\n  Operation sequence:\n\n  Option A:\n      Move the cursor to l (if necessary) then close the left part (so now the left boundary is l). Then move the cursor to r (if necessary) and close the right part.\n\n  Option B:\n      Move the cursor to r, then close the right part, then move to l and close the left part.\n\n  But note: we might not need to move the cursor if we are already at a good position.\n\n  Alternatively, we can combine the movements.\n\n  However, note that we can also close one side without moving the cursor from the initial position if we are already at the correct boundary.\n\n  Let me analyze the example: \"6 3 2 4\" -> output 5.\n\n  Steps in the example:\n      Start: n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n      Operation 1: shift the mouse cursor to the left (from 3 to 2) -> 1 second.\n      Operation 2: close all the tabs to the left (now the left boundary is 2, so the tabs [1] are closed) -> 1 second (total 2 seconds so far).\n      Now the state: tabs [2,6], cursor at 2, boundaries (a=2, b=6).\n      Operation 3: shift the mouse cursor to the right from 2 to 3 (1 second) then to 4 (another second) -> 2 seconds (total 4 seconds).\n      Operation 4: close all the tabs to the right (from 5 to 6) -> 1 second (total 5 seconds).\n\n  Alternatively, we could try:\n\n      Start at 3.\n      Operation 1: move right to 4 (1 second).\n      Operation 2: close right (from 5 to 6) -> 1 second (total 2 seconds).\n      Then we need to close the left: move left to 2 (from 4 to 3 to 2: 2 seconds) then close left (1 second) -> total 5 seconds.\n\n  Or:\n\n      Operation 1: move left to 2 (1 second), close left (1 second) -> then we have [2,6] and cursor at 2.\n      Then move right from 2 to 4: 2 seconds, then close right: 1 second -> total 5 seconds.\n\n  So the example requires 5 seconds.\n\n  How to compute?\n\n  We need to consider:\n\n  - If we don't need to close anything (l==1 and r==n), then 0 seconds.\n\n  Otherwise, we break into two parts: left closure and right closure.\n\n  For the left closure (if needed): we must get the cursor to at least l (because we cannot close the left part from a position < l, because then we would close some required tabs? Actually, if we are at a tab < l, then the left closure would close from the current left boundary (which is at most the current tab) to the left of the cursor. But wait, the current left boundary is the smallest open tab. Initially, the left boundary is 1. But after closing the left part, we set the left boundary to the cursor's position. However, if we are at a tab i < l, then closing the left part would set the left boundary to i, which is < l, meaning we leave tabs [i, ...] but then we still have [i, r] which includes tabs from i to r, but i<l, so we haven't removed all tabs < l. Therefore, we must be at a tab >= l to close the left part.\n\n  Similarly, to close the right part, we must be at a tab <= r.\n\n  Therefore, we must move the cursor to a position that is at least l (for the left closure) and then later (if we do left closure first) we must move again to a position <= r for the right closure. But note: we might do both closures from the same position if that position is in [l, r]. \n\n  Actually, if we do the left closure from a position i (>=l) and then the right closure from the same position i (which must be <=r) then we require that i is in [l, r]. But if we do left closure first, then we must have i>=l, and then for the right closure we must have i<=r. So if we do both from the same position, that position must be in [l, r]. \n\n  However, we can also do:\n\n      Step 1: Move to a position i (>=l) and close left.\n      Step 2: Then move to a position j (<=r) and close right.\n\n  But note: after closing the left, the set of tabs is [l, n] (if we closed the left) and the boundaries become (a=l, b=n). Then to close the right, we must be at a tab <= r (and then we close the right part). \n\n  Alternatively, we might not need to move the cursor to the same position for both.\n\n  Let me define:\n\n  Let left_steps = steps to move the cursor from the current position to a position >= l (if we are going to do left closure first) OR to a position <= r (if we are going to do right closure first) ?\n\n  Actually, we have two independent tasks. We can consider two orders: left first then right, or right first then left.\n\n  Let f(order) = steps for the given order.\n\n  Order 1: Left first then Right.\n\n      Step 1: Move from `pos` to a tab >= l. The minimal movement for this is |pos - x|, where x is the closest tab >= l (which is max(l, pos) if we are moving in one direction? Actually, we can move left or right arbitrarily, but we want the minimal steps.\n\n      However, note: we are allowed to move one step at a time. The minimal steps to reach a tab >= l from `pos` is:\n          If pos >= l: then we are already at a tab >= l, so 0 steps.\n          Else: we need to move right until we hit l, so steps = l - pos.\n\n      But wait: what if we are at pos=3, and we want to go to l=2? Then we are already at a tab >=2? Actually, no: 3>=2, so we don't need to move for left closure? But wait: the condition for left closure is being at a tab >= l. So if we are at 3 (which is >=2) then we can close the left part.\n\n      However, in the example: we started at 3, which is >=2 (l=2) so we could close the left part immediately? But note: the example didn't do that. Why?\n\n      Because the example did: \n          shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2 (which is from 3 to 2, so one step) and then closed the left part.\n\n      Why did they shift to 2? Because if we are at 3, and we close the left part, then we close all tabs to the left of 3, which is [1,2]. But wait, 2 is in the required segment [2,4]? No, because 2 is included. So we cannot close [1,2] because 2 is required.\n\n      Therefore, the condition for closing the left part is: we must close only the tabs that are strictly less than l. So if we are at a tab i, then we close [a, i-1]. We want to leave [l, r]. Therefore, we must ensure that the closure does not remove l. \n\n      So to close the left part, we must have i-1 < l, i.e., i <= l. But wait, the closure operation closes from the current left boundary (which is the smallest open tab) to i-1. However, initially the left boundary is 1. But if we have already closed some tabs, then the left boundary might be higher.\n\n      This is getting complicated.\n\n  Let me re-read the problem statement: \n      \"close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1]\"\n\n  And note: a is the current minimum index of an unclosed tab. Initially a=1, and if we close the left part, then we set a=i (the cursor's current tab). But if we are at i, then we close [a, i-1]. We want to leave [l, r]. Therefore, we must close all tabs with index < l. So we must have that the closure operation removes [a, i-1] and we require that [a, i-1] does not include any tab >= l. \n\n  Actually, we require that i-1 < l, i.e., i <= l. Then the closure [a, i-1] will not touch l because l is at least i (since i<=l) and we are closing up to i-1 (which is less than l). \n\n  Similarly, for the right closure: we close [i+1, b] and we require that i+1 > r, i.e., i >= r. Then the closure [i+1, b] will not touch r.\n\n  Therefore, the conditions are:\n\n      To close the left part: the cursor must be at a tab i such that i <= l. Then we close [a, i-1] and since i<=l, then i-1 < l, so we close everything from the current left boundary to i-1 (which is below l). \n\n      To close the right part: the cursor must be at a tab i such that i >= r. Then we close [i+1, b] and since i>=r, then i+1>r, so we close everything above i (which is above r).\n\n  But note: initially, the cursor is at `pos`. \n\n  Therefore, for the left part, we must move the cursor to a tab i (if not already) such that i <= l. The minimal steps to get to such an i is:\n\n      If pos <= l: then we can use the current tab (or move to a tab <= l). But note: we might be at a tab <= l, then we can close the left part. However, if we are at a tab > l, then we must move left until we hit l (or even below l? but the tabs below l are already to be closed, so we don't need to move beyond l? Actually, we can stop at l because if we are at l, then we can close the left part (since l<=l, then we close [a, l-1] and that doesn't touch l).\n\n      But wait: what if we are at a tab i (<=l) but not at l? For example, if l=5 and we are at 3 (which is <=5) then we can close the left part from 3: we close [a,2] (if a=1) and that leaves [3, n] which includes the required [5,?] but also leaves 3,4 which are not required? \n\n      This is the catch: we are allowed to leave extra tabs? No, we must leave only [l, r]. \n\n      Therefore, we cannot close the left part from a tab i that is less than l? Because then we leave the tabs from i to r, but i<l, so we have an extra tab i (which is <l) and also we haven't closed the tabs between i and l? \n\n      Actually, no: the closure operation only closes the left part from the current left boundary to i-1. It does not automatically close the gaps. We have to close the left part entirely (all tabs < l). \n\n      So if we are at a tab i (<=l) and we close the left part, then we set the left boundary to i. Then we must make sure that i >= l? No, because then we leave [i, ...] and i<l, so we still have tabs from i to r, which includes [i, l-1] (which are not required) and [l, r] (which is required). \n\n      Therefore, we cannot close the left part from a tab i that is less than l. We must set the left boundary to l. \n\n      How can we set the left boundary to l? We must have the cursor at a tab i such that i <= l, and then we close the left part, which sets the left boundary to i. But then i must be l? \n\n      Actually, no: if we are at a tab i (with i < l) and we close the left part, we set the left boundary to i, but then we still have tabs from i to l-1 (which are not desired) and we haven't closed them. \n\n      So the condition for closing the left part is not just i<=l, but we must have i = l? \n\n      Let me read the operation: \n          \"close all the tabs to the left of the cursor\" -> sets the left boundary to i (the cursor's current tab). \n\n      This means that after the closure, the left boundary is i. We want the left boundary to be l (so that no tab < l remains). Therefore, we must set the left boundary to l. \n\n      How? We must be at tab l (or above) to close the left part? \n\n      Actually, if we are at a tab i (>=l), then when we close the left part, we close from the current left boundary (say a0) to i-1. Then the new left boundary becomes i. \n\n      But we want the left boundary to be l. Therefore, we must have i = l? \n\n      Example: \n          Initially, we have [1,6] and we are at 3, and we want to set the left boundary to 2 (l=2). \n          We must be at a tab i such that when we close the left part, the left boundary becomes 2. \n\n          Operation: we must be at tab 2 (then close the left part: from 1 to 1, so the left boundary becomes 2). \n\n          Alternatively, if we are at tab 3 (which is >=2), then closing the left part would set the left boundary to 3, which is not what we want.\n\n      Therefore, to set the left boundary to l, we must be at a tab i such that i == l (exactly). Similarly, to set the right boundary to r, we must be at a tab i such that i == r.\n\n  Now the conditions are clearer:\n\n      To close the left part (set the left boundary to l), we must have the cursor at l and then perform the left closure. Similarly, to close the right part (set the right boundary to r), we must have the cursor at r and then perform the right closure.\n\n  Then the problem becomes:\n\n      We start at `pos`. We need to:\n        - If l is not 1, then we must get the cursor to l (if we are not already there) and then close the left part (if we haven't already done so by having the cursor at l from a previous closure? but note: we are only allowed to close one contiguous part per operation, and we have to set the left boundary to l, which requires being at l).\n\n      Similarly for the right part.\n\n  Therefore, we have two independent moves (unless we can use the same movement for both):\n\n      Steps for left closure (if needed) = \n          If we are at l, then 0 moves for positioning, then 1 second for the closure.\n          Otherwise, we need to move from `pos` to l. The minimal steps to move from `pos` to l is |pos - l|.\n\n      Then, for the right closure (if needed):\n          Steps for right closure = \n          If we are at r, then 0 moves, else |current_position - r| (but note: after closing the left part, the current_position might be l, and then we need to move from l to r for the right closure).\n\n  However, we can choose the order:\n\n      Option 1: First close the left part, then the right part.\n\n          Total moves for left: |pos - l|\n          Then, after closing the left part, the cursor is at l. Then we need to move from l to r: |l - r|\n          Then, we close the right part: 1 second.\n\n          But wait: we already have the closure operation (each closure is 1 second). So:\n\n          Option 1: \n            Steps = |pos - l| (move to l) + 1 (close left) + |l - r| (move to r) + 1 (close right) - but wait, we don't necessarily need to move from l to r if we are already at r? \n\n          However, note: after closing the left part, the cursor is at l. Then to close the right part, we must be at r. So we must move from l to r.\n\n          But what if we are already at r after the left closure? That is, if l == r, then we don't need to move. But if l != r, then we need to move.\n\n      Option 2: First close the right part, then the left part.\n\n          Steps for right: |pos - r|\n          Then, after closing the right part, the cursor is at r. Then move from r to l: |r - l|\n          Then, close the left part: 1 second.\n\n      Option 3: Maybe we can close both from the same position? But note: we must be at l to close the left and at r to close the right. So if l == r, then we can do:\n\n          Steps = |pos - l| (move to l/r) + 2 (one closure for left and one for right? Actually, no: we can only close one side per operation. But if we are at l (which is also r) then we can do:\n\n          First, close the left part: then the left boundary becomes l, and then we must close the right part: from the same position (which is l) we can close the right part? \n\n          Condition for closing the right part: we must be at a tab i>=r. But if we are at l and l==r, then we are at r, so we can close the right part.\n\n          So if l==r, then we can:\n\n          Steps = |pos - l| (move to l) + 2 (two closures: one for left and one for right)\n\n          But wait: the problem says we can only close one side per operation. So we do two separate operations.\n\n      However, note: the example input \"6 3 1 3\" -> output 1.\n\n          Here, n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3.\n\n          We need to close the right part (since r=3, and n=6, so we have to close [4,6]). \n\n          Steps: \n            Since we are at 3, which is >= r (r=3) so we can close the right part from 3: 1 second.\n\n          But why not the left part? The left part is already closed because l=1, so we don't need to close the left part.\n\n          Therefore, the answer is 1.\n\n      So we must account for:\n\n        If l == 1 and r == n: then 0.\n\n        Otherwise, we have two closures to do, unless one side doesn't need closure.\n\n      Let me define:\n\n        left_needed = (l > 1)\n        right_needed = (r < n)\n\n      Then:\n\n        If left_needed and right_needed:\n\n            Option 1: left first then right.\n                Steps = |pos - l| + 1 + |l - r| + 1\n\n            Option 2: right first then left.\n                Steps = |pos - r| + 1 + |r - l| + 1\n\n            But note: the distance |l - r| is the same as |r - l|, so we can write:\n\n                Option1: |pos-l| + |l-r| + 2\n                Option2: |pos-r| + |r-l| + 2\n\n            Then take the minimum of these two.\n\n        If only left_needed (l>1 and r==n):\n\n            Steps = |pos - l| + 1   (we must move to l and then close left)\n\n        If only right_needed (r<n and l==1):\n\n            Steps = |pos - r| + 1\n\n        If neither (l==1 and r==n): 0\n\n      However, wait: in the example \"6 3 1 3\": \n          n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3 -> only right_needed is true (since r=3<6). \n          Steps = |3-3| + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 -> matches.\n\n      Example 1: \"6 3 2 4\": \n          n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4 -> both needed.\n          Option1: |3-2| + |2-4| + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n          Option2: |3-4| + |4-2| + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n          So answer is 5.\n\n      Example 3: \"5 2 1 5\": \n          n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5 -> no closure needed (since l==1 and r==5) -> 0.\n\n      Another example: \"10 5 3 7\" \n          Both needed: left (l=3) and right (r=7, n=10)\n          Option1: |5-3| + |3-7| + 2 = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\n          Option2: |5-7| + |7-3| + 2 = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.\n\n      But wait, is there a better way? \n\n      Consider: we don't necessarily have to go to the exact boundaries. What if we can use a single movement that covers both?\n\n      However, note: the closure operations require being exactly at the boundary (l for left, r for right). \n\n      But wait, what if we are at a tab between l and r? Then we can close one side, but not the other? \n\n      Actually, no: to close the left part we must be at l (exactly) and to close the right part we must be at r (exactly). \n\n      Therefore, the above formula holds.\n\n  However, let me test with a different example: \"10 1 3 7\"\n\n      We start at 1. We need to close the left part (l=3) and the right part (r=7).\n\n      Option1: \n          Move from 1 to 3: 2 steps, then close left (1 step) -> then we are at 3.\n          Then move from 3 to 7: 4 steps, then close right (1 step) -> total 2+1+4+1 = 8.\n\n      Option2:\n          Move from 1 to 7: 6 steps, then close right (1 step) -> then we are at 7.\n          Then move from 7 to 3: 4 steps, then close left (1 step) -> total 6+1+4+1 = 12.\n\n      So 8 is the answer.\n\n  But wait, is there a smarter way?\n\n      After closing the left part, the left boundary becomes 3. Then the available tabs are [3,10]. Now, we are at 3. Then we need to close the right part: we must be at 7. \n\n      However, note: we can move from 3 to 7 in 4 steps, then close the right part.\n\n      Alternatively, can we close the right part without moving the entire way? \n\n      Actually, we must be at 7 to close the right part. So no.\n\n  However, consider if we are allowed to close the right part from a tab that is greater than r? \n\n      Condition for closing the right part: we must be at a tab i such that i>=r. Then we close [i+1, b]. \n\n      In the example, if we are at 3 (which is <7) then we cannot close the right part from 3? \n\n      But wait, the condition is i>=r (r=7). 3>=7 is false. Therefore, we must move to 7.\n\n  Therefore, the formula is:\n\n      if l == 1 and r == n:\n          ans = 0\n      else:\n          if l > 1 and r < n:\n              ans = min( abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2, abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2 )\n          elif l > 1:\n              ans = abs(pos - l) + 1\n          elif r < n:\n              ans = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n  But wait, the above formula for the case when both are needed adds 2 for the two closures. However, note that the closure operations are separate: each closure takes 1 second. So we have two closure operations (each 1 second) and the movement operations (each move is 1 second). \n\n  However, note: the movement from the initial position to l (or r) and then to r (or l) is |pos-l| and |l-r|, and then two closure operations (each 1 second). \n\n  But wait: in the example \"6 3 2 4\", we moved from 3 to 2 (1 second) and then from 2 to 4 (2 seconds) and then two closure operations (each 1 second). So total seconds: 1 (move left) + 2 (move right) + 1 (first closure) + 1 (second closure) = 5.\n\n  In our formula for Option1: \n      abs(3-2) = 1, abs(2-4)=2, then +2 (for the two closures) -> 1+2+2 = 5.\n\n  However, note: the closure operations are not included in the movement, so we are adding the movement and then the two closure seconds.\n\n  But wait, in the code above, we are adding the two closure seconds (each 1) by adding 2.\n\n  So the formula is correct.\n\n  However, there's a catch: what if we are already at the boundary? \n\n      Example: \"10 3 3 7\" -> only right closure needed (since l=3, so left is already set? Actually, no: we have to check the condition: we need to leave [3,7]. Initially, we have [1,10]. We must close the left part? \n\n      Condition for left part: we must close the left part because initially the left boundary is 1, and we want the left boundary to be 3. So we must close the left part. \n\n      But wait, the condition for the left part is that we must set the left boundary to l (3). We are at 3, so we can close the left part. Then we must close the right part: we are at 3, but to close the right part we must be at 7. \n\n      Therefore, for \"10 3 3 7\":\n\n          left_needed: l=3>1 -> True\n          right_needed: r=7<10 -> True\n\n          So we use the both-needed formula.\n\n          Option1: |3-3| + |3-7| + 2 = 0 + 4 + 2 = 6.\n          Option2: |3-7| + |7-3| + 2 = 4 + 4 + 2 = 10.\n\n          Answer = 6.\n\n      Steps for Option1:\n          Already at 3, close left (1 second) -> now the left boundary is 3, and we are at 3.\n          Then move from 3 to 7 (4 seconds), then close right (1 second) -> total 6.\n\n      But wait, after closing the left part, the set of tabs is [3,10]. Then we must close the right part (from 8 to 10). To close the right part, we must be at 7 (because 7>=7). So we must move from 3 to 7 (4 steps) and then close the right part.\n\n  However, note: we can also consider: what if we are at 3, and we don't move to 7 by going right? \n\n      We are allowed to move left/right arbitrarily, but the minimal steps from 3 to 7 is 4.\n\n  But wait, is there a possibility to avoid moving from 3 to 7? \n\n      No, because we must be at 7 to close the right part.\n\n  Therefore, the formula holds.\n\n  However, wait: what if we do the right closure first? \n\n      We are at 3. To close the right part, we must be at 7. So we move from 3 to 7 (4 steps). Then close the right part (1 second). Now the set of tabs is [3,7]. Then we must close the left part? But the left part is already closed (we set the left boundary to 3). \n\n      But wait, the left part closure sets the left boundary to the cursor's position. Initially, we are at 3, then we move to 7. Then we close the right part: the left boundary is still 3 (because the left closure hasn't been done). Then we are at 7. Then we must close the left part: but to close the left part, we must be at 3. So we move from 7 to 3 (4 steps) and then close the left part (1 second). \n\n      Then total: 4 (right move) + 1 (close right) + 4 (left move) + 1 (close left) = 10.\n\n  Therefore, the formula for both needed is correct.\n\n  But wait: what if we are already at the boundary for one side? \n\n      Example: \"10 7 3 7\" -> both needed, but we are at 7 (the right boundary). \n\n          Option1: |7-3| + |3-7| + 2 = 4 + 4 + 2 = 10.\n          Option2: |7-7| + |7-3| + 2 = 0 + 4 + 2 = 6.\n\n      Steps for Option2:\n          We are at 7, so we can close the right part (since 7>=7) -> 1 second (now the set is [3,7]).\n          Then we must close the left part: we are at 7, so we must move to 3 (4 steps) and then close the left part (1 second) -> total 1+4+1 = 6.\n\n  So the formula works.\n\n  However, note: the absolute differences are symmetric.\n\n  Therefore, we can write the code as:\n\n      Read n, pos, l, r.\n\n      if l == 1 and r == n:\n          print(0)\n      elif l > 1 and r < n:\n          option1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2\n          option2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2\n          print(min(option1, option2))\n      elif l > 1:\n          print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n      else: # r < n\n          print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n\n  But wait, what if the initial position is already in the segment [l, r]? \n\n      Example: \"10 5 3 7\" -> both needed, and pos=5 is in [3,7]. \n\n      Our formula: \n          option1: |5-3| + |3-7| + 2 = 2+4+2 = 8\n          option2: |5-7| + |7-3| + 2 = 2+4+2 = 8\n\n      Correct.\n\n  However, note: the above formula for the case when only one side is needed: \n\n      Example: \"10 5 3 10\" -> only left needed (l=3>1, and r=10==n). \n          Steps =",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] in her browser. The browser starts with all tabs from 1 to n open, and the cursor is initially at position pos. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right (each move takes 1 second) or closing all tabs to the left or right of the cursor (each closure operation also takes 1 second).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to leave only the tabs within the segment [l, r]. This requires closing all tabs to the left of l and all tabs to the right of r. The key observation is that to close the left part (tabs < l), the cursor must be exactly at position l. Similarly, to close the right part (tabs > r), the cursor must be exactly at position r. \n\n2. **Intuition**: \n   - If the entire range [1, n] is already within [l, r], no operations are needed.\n   - Otherwise, if only one side (left or right) needs closing, the minimal steps are the distance from the initial cursor position to the boundary (l or r) plus one second for the closure operation.\n   - If both sides need closing, we consider two options: closing the left part first then the right, or vice versa. For each option, the total steps include moving to the respective boundary, performing the closure, and then moving to the other boundary for the next closure.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves checking the conditions for left and right closures:\n   - If neither closure is needed, the answer is 0.\n   - If only one closure is needed, the answer is the Manhattan distance from the initial position to the boundary plus 1.\n   - If both closures are needed, compute the minimal steps between the two possible sequences (left then right, or right then left).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves simple arithmetic operations and conditional checks, making it efficient with a constant time complexity O(1).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    pos = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    r = int(data[3])\n    \n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n    elif l > 1 and r < n:\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2\n        print(min(option1, option2))\n    elif l > 1:\n        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n    else:\n        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: The input consists of four integers: n (number of tabs), pos (initial cursor position), l (left boundary of the segment to keep), and r (right boundary of the segment to keep).\n- **Condition Checks**:\n  - If the segment [l, r] covers all tabs (i.e., l is 1 and r is n), no operations are needed, so the answer is 0.\n  - If both left and right closures are required, the solution calculates the minimal steps by considering two sequences: moving to the left boundary first or the right boundary first. Each sequence includes moving to the boundary, performing the closure, and then moving to the other boundary for the subsequent closure.\n  - If only one closure is needed (either left or right), the solution simply computes the distance from the initial position to the respective boundary and adds one second for the closure operation.\n- **Output**: The minimal number of seconds required is printed based on the above conditions.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures optimal performance with minimal computational overhead.",
