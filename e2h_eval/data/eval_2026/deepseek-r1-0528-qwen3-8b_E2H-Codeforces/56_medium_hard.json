Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers R and B (number of rebels and bases) and then 2R+B points (R for rebels, then B for bases).\n We need to check if there exists a perfect matching (one-to-one) between the R rebels and B bases (so R must equal B? Actually, note: the problem says \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\", but also says \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", so it's a perfect matching meaning R must equal B. However, the input constraints say that R, B can be from 1 to 10, but not necessarily equal? But wait: the example input: first line is \"3 3\", then 3 rebels and 3 bases.\n\n Actually, reading the problem: \n   \"the assignment is a perfect matching\" meaning that every rebel is matched with one base and vice versa. So we require R = B.\n\n But note: the input format says: first line: R, B (then R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases). And the example input: first example has R=3, B=3.\n\n However, the second example: \"2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1\" -> here R=2, B=1, and the output is 'No'. Since the condition requires a perfect matching (each spaceship to one base and each base to one spaceship) then we must have R=B. Therefore, if R != B, we can immediately output 'No'.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read R and B.\n 2. If R != B, output 'No' and exit.\n 3. Read the next R lines for rebels and then B lines for bases. But wait, the total number of points is R+B, and the input format is: \n        First line: R, B\n        Then R lines (each with two integers) for rebels\n        Then B lines (each with two integers) for bases.\n\n However, note the example input string: \n        \"3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2\"\n\n But wait, the example input is given as a list of strings? Actually, in the example, the input is provided as:\n\n        Input: \n          ['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n This is just an example representation. In actual input, we read from stdin.\n\n Let's assume the input is given as standard input.\n\n Approach:\n\n Since R and B are at most 10, we can try to use a combinatorial approach. However, the constraint is that the straight paths (from base to its assigned spaceship) do not intersect.\n\n How to check non-intersection? Note: the entire set of points (rebels and bases) are in general position (no three colinear). The problem is to assign the rebels to bases such that the segments (connecting each base to its rebel) do not cross.\n\n Observation: In fact, we are to find a non-crossing perfect matching between two sets of points (R rebels and B bases, but R=B). However, note: the matching is between two distinct sets (rebels and bases) and the segments must not intersect.\n\n But note: the rebels and bases are distinct sets. However, the condition is that the straight paths (segments) from a base to its assigned rebel do not intersect.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths from a base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect\". This means that we have a set of segments (each base connected to one rebel) and these segments must not cross.\n\n Also note: the entire set of points (both rebels and bases) are in general position (no three colinear). \n\n We can think of this as: given two sets of points (say A for rebels and B for bases) of size n (n=R=B), we want to know if there exists a bijection f: A -> B such that the segments (a, f(a)) for all a in A do not cross.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require that the entire set of segments forms a planar graph? Actually, the condition is that no two segments intersect. But note: the endpoints are distinct and no three colinear, so the only way two segments can intersect is if they share an endpoint or if they cross in the interior. But we are only drawing segments between the two sets, and the condition is that the segments do not intersect (so no interior crossing).\n\n Important: The problem does not require that the matching is drawn without any other conditions, but only that the straight paths (the segments) do not intersect.\n\n However, note: the bases and rebels are distinct and the segments are between base and rebel. Two segments (b1, r1) and (b2, r2) would cross if the four points are in alternating order (like the convex hull property). \n\n But note: we have two sets. There is a known method to check for non-crossing matchings between two sets: \n\n Idea: We can use the following:\n\n   - Consider the entire set of points (rebels and bases) and sort them by x-coordinate (or y-coordinate) and then try to see if the matching is non-crossing.\n\n However, note: the matching is between two sets. One common approach is to fix a base and then consider the relative positions of the rebels.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n   We can consider the bipartite graph where edges exist between a base and a rebel if the segment connecting them does not cross any other segment? But that is too expensive because we don't know the entire matching.\n\n Another idea: \n\n   Since the problem is small (n <= 10), we can try to generate all perfect matchings (there are n! which is up to 10! = 3628800, which is acceptable for n=10, but actually n<=10 and the factorial of 10 is about 3.6e6, which is acceptable in Python if we code carefully).\n\n However, we must check for each matching whether the set of segments does not have any crossings.\n\n How to check for crossings in a set of segments?\n\n   For a set of segments, we can check by iterating over every pair of segments and check if they cross.\n\n   Conditions for two segments (a, b) and (c, d) to cross (when no three points are colinear and the endpoints are distinct):\n\n        The two segments (a,b) and (c,d) cross if the points c and d lie on opposite sides of the line defined by a and b, and the points a and b lie on opposite sides of the line defined by c and d.\n\n   But note: our segments are from base to rebel, and we have n segments. We must check that no two segments cross.\n\n   However, note: the endpoints of the segments are the bases and rebels. The entire set of points is fixed. We can write a helper function:\n\n        def segments_intersect(seg1, seg2):\n            # seg1 = (A, B), seg2 = (C, D) where A, B, C, D are points (tuples of (x,y))\n            # Check if the two segments AB and CD intersect.\n\n        But note: the segments are from base to rebel, and we are only drawing these n segments. We must ensure that the two segments do not share an endpoint (since the matching is one-to-one, the endpoints are distinct). However, the condition of crossing typically requires that the segments do not share an endpoint.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the standard method:\n\n        def ccw(A, B, C):\n            # returns True if the three points A,B,C are counterclockwise (oriented left)\n            return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0]) > 0\n\n        def segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n            # Check if segments AB and CD intersect (proper intersection, not at endpoints)\n            o1 = ccw(A, C, B)\n            o2 = ccw(B, C, D)\n            o3 = ccw(C, A, D)\n            o4 = ccw(D, A, B)\n\n            # General case: the segments intersect if one point of CD is on one side of AB and the other on the other, and vice versa.\n            if (o1 > 0 and o2 < 0) or (o1 < 0 and o2 > 0):\n                if (o3 > 0 and o4 < 0) or (o3 < 0 and o4 > 0):\n                    return True\n                else:\n                    return False\n            elif o1 == 0 and point_on_segment(A, B, C): # but note: the problem states no three points are colinear, so this might not occur?\n                return False\n            elif o2 == 0 and point_on_segment(A, B, D):\n                return False\n            elif o3 == 0 and point_on_segment(C, D, A):\n                return False\n            elif o4 == 0 and point_on_segment(C, D, B):\n                return False\n            else:\n                return False\n\n   However, the problem states: \"no three points are on the same line\", so we don't have to worry about collinear points? Actually, the condition says \"no three points are on the same line\", meaning that if three points are colinear, they are not present. But note: the segments are defined by two points. So when checking two segments, we have four distinct points? Not necessarily: the four points could be in convex position or not, but no three are colinear. So we don't have to worry about degenerate cases.\n\n   But wait: what if two segments share an endpoint? Then they are not crossing (they meet at an endpoint, but the condition is that the paths (the entire segment) do not intersect. The problem says \"any two (straight) paths ... do not intersect\", and typically in such problems, sharing an endpoint is allowed (but note: the matching is one-to-one, so each base and rebel is used exactly once. So the endpoints of the segments are distinct and no two segments share an endpoint. Therefore, we don't have to worry about endpoint intersections.\n\n   Therefore, we can assume that the four endpoints are distinct and no three colinear.\n\n   However, note: the entire set of points (all rebels and bases) are distinct (guaranteed). And the matching is a bijection, so the endpoints of the two segments are distinct.\n\n   So we can simplify:\n\n        Two segments (A,B) and (C,D) (with {A,B} ∩ {C,D} empty) do not share an endpoint.\n\n        Then, they intersect if and only if the two segments cross (not at an endpoint).\n\n        Condition: \n            (ccw(A, C, B) * ccw(A, D, B) < 0) and (ccw(C, A, D) * ccw(C, B, D) < 0)\n\n   Actually, the standard method is:\n\n        def segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n            # Check orientation of the four points\n            def ccw(A, B, C):\n                return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n            o1 = ccw(A, B, C)\n            o2 = ccw(A, B, D)\n            o3 = ccw(C, D, A)\n            o4 = ccw(C, D, B)\n\n            # General case: if the two segments intersect, then the points of one segment are on opposite sides of the other segment, and vice versa.\n            if ((o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)):\n                return True\n            return False\n\n   But note: there is also the possibility that the segments are collinear? Our problem says no three points are colinear, so the four points are in general position. However, the above condition uses the cross products and the product being negative (meaning opposite sides) is sufficient.\n\n 4. Algorithm:\n\n    Step 1: Read R and B. If R != B, output \"No\".\n    Step 2: Read the next R lines (rebels) and B lines (bases). We'll have two lists: \n            rebels = list of (x, y) for R points.\n            bases = list of (x, y) for B points.\n\n    Step 3: Generate all permutations of the bases (which are of length R) and check if there exists a permutation p such that the matching (base i connected to rebel j) produces a set of segments that do not cross.\n\n    Step 4: For a given permutation p (which assigns base i to rebel j, where j is the index in the rebels list) we have a set of segments: [ (rebels[j], bases[i]) for each j ].\n\n    Step 5: Check that for every pair of distinct segments (i.e., for every two distinct indices j1, j2) the segments do not intersect.\n\n    Step 6: If we find one permutation that satisfies the condition, output \"Yes\". Otherwise, after checking all permutations, output \"No\".\n\n However, note: the problem says that the rebels and bases are given in two separate sets. The rebels are the first R points, and bases are the next B points. But the assignment is between bases and rebels (not between rebels and bases arbitrarily). We are to assign each base to one rebel.\n\n But note: the problem does not specify that the rebels and bases are labeled. The rebels are labeled 1..R and bases are labeled 1..B, but the assignment is arbitrary.\n\n However, the problem does not specify that the rebels must be assigned in a particular order. So we are free to assign any base to any rebel.\n\n But wait: the example input: \n        Input: \n          3 3\n          0 0\n          2 0\n          3 1\n          -2 1\n          0 3\n          2 2\n\n        Output: Yes\n\n    How did they get yes? One possible matching is: \n        base (-2,1) -> rebel (0,0)\n        base (0,3) -> rebel (2,0)\n        base (2,2) -> rebel (3,1)\n\n    But note: the example input has the rebels in the order (0,0), (2,0), (3,1) and bases in the order (-2,1), (0,3), (2,2).\n\n    However, we are generating permutations of the bases (so we are assigning the bases to the rebels). But note: the rebels are fixed and distinct. The condition is independent of the labeling of the rebels.\n\n    But note: the rebels are fixed, so we have a fixed set of rebels. We are matching the bases (which are given as a list of B points) to the rebels (a fixed list of R points). So the permutation is on the bases.\n\n    However, we can also think: we have two sets of points, and we want to know if there exists a bijection (matching) between the two sets (without labeling) that yields non-crossing segments? \n\n    But wait: the problem does not specify which base is which. The input gives the bases and rebels as two distinct sets. The condition is that we assign each base (each base is a point) to one rebel (each rebel is a point). The assignment is arbitrary.\n\n    However, note: the rebels are given as the first R points and bases as the next B points. But the problem does not assign labels to the bases. So we are free to assign any base to any rebel.\n\n    Therefore, we can fix the rebels and permute the bases.\n\n    But note: the rebels are also fixed in space. The condition depends on the geometric positions.\n\n    However, the problem does not require that the matching is between the i-th rebel and the i-th base. It's arbitrary.\n\n    So we can do:\n\n        Let rebels = list of R points.\n        Let bases = list of B points.\n\n        Then, we consider all permutations of the bases (which are B! in number, but B=R, so R! which is 10! = 3628800 for R=10, which is acceptable).\n\n    But wait: R and B are both at least 1 and at most 10, and we require R=B, so we are permuting a list of R elements (which is at most 10). The number of permutations is factorial(R) which for R=10 is 3628800, which is acceptable in Python if we code the segment intersection check efficiently.\n\n    However, we must check for each permutation the entire set of segments (which has R segments) and check that none of the pairs of segments (there are C(n,2) pairs) intersect. For n=10, the number of pairs is 45, and for each pair we do a constant time check (using the ccw function). So the inner loop for one permutation is O(n^2) and the total is O(n! * n^2). For n=10, 10! is about 3.6e6, and 3.6e6 * 45 is about 162 million checks, which is acceptable in Pyton in many cases (if implemented in C++/Java it would be fast, but in Python we should be cautious).\n\n    But wait: 10! is 3628800, and for each permutation we check C(10,2)=45 pairs, so 3628800 * 45 = 163296000, which is about 163 million checks. Each check does 4 ccw calls (each ccw is a few multiplications and subtractions). This is acceptable in Pyton if we run it in a compiled language, but in pure Python it might take a few seconds. However, 163 million operations is acceptable in modern computers for a single run (assuming each operation is a few cycles). We must hope that the input is small (n<=10) and worst-case n=10 is the maximum.\n\n    Alternatively, we can optimize by breaking early: if we find one crossing, we break and try the next permutation.\n\n    Steps for one permutation:\n\n        Let matching = [ (rebels[i], bases_permuted[i]) for i in range(n) ]\n\n        Then, for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i+1, n):\n                segment1 = (matching[i][0], matching[i][1])   # Wait, no: our matching is: for the i-th rebel (fixed by the list) we assign the i-th base in the permutation. But wait, actually: \n\n        Actually, let me define:\n\n            We have two lists: \n                rebels = [r0, r1, ..., r_{n-1}]\n                bases_permuted = [b0, b1, ..., b_{n-1}]   (a permutation of the bases)\n\n            Then the matching is: \n                segment0: from r0 to b0\n                segment1: from r1 to b1\n                ...\n\n        Then, we need to check that for every pair (i, j) (i < j), the segment (r_i, b_i) and (r_j, b_j) do not intersect.\n\n        But note: the rebels are fixed, so we are using the same order for the rebels. However, the problem does not specify an order for the rebels. We are allowed to assign arbitrarily, but we fixed the rebels in the given order and then assign the bases arbitrarily.\n\n        But note: the rebels are given in a fixed order, but the problem does not say that the rebels must be matched in that order. However, the problem says: \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\". The rebels are distinct and bases are distinct, and we are free to assign any base to any rebel. So we are effectively considering the rebels as unlabeled? Actually, no: the rebels are given as a set of points. The assignment is between two sets. \n\n        However, the matching is between the set of rebels and the set of bases. The condition is that the segments (from base to rebel) do not cross.\n\n        But note: the problem does not specify which base is connected to which rebel. So we are free to assign arbitrarily.\n\n        But wait: the rebels are fixed in the input, but we are allowed to assign any base to any rebel. So the order of the rebels does not matter for the matching. We are going to assign each base to one rebel. Therefore, we can fix the rebels in the given order and then consider all permutations of the bases (which are the same as considering all bijections from bases to rebels). \n\n        However, note: the rebels are distinct points, so the assignment is a bijection from bases to rebels. But the condition of non-crossing is independent of the labeling of the rebels. \n\n        But wait: the rebels are fixed in space. The matching is a set of segments from each base to one rebel. The condition is that the segments do not cross. The rebels are fixed, so we cannot change their positions.\n\n        So we must consider the rebels as fixed and the bases as fixed, and then assign the bases to the rebels arbitrarily.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            Let rebels = list of R points (given)\n            Let bases = list of B points (given)\n\n            Then, we consider all permutations of the bases (which are of size R) and assign the i-th base in the permutation to the i-th rebel.\n\n            Then, we check the entire set of segments (from the i-th rebel to the i-th base in the permutation) for crossings.\n\n        However, note: the rebels are fixed. But the problem does not require that the rebels are assigned in the order of the input. Actually, we are free to assign any base to any rebel. So we can also consider permuting the rebels? \n\n        But wait: the problem says \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\", meaning that each spaceship (rebel) is assigned one base. The rebels are distinct, so we cannot assign two bases to one rebel.\n\n        However, we can also consider: fix the bases and permute the rebels? Actually, we can fix one set and permute the other. The condition is symmetric? \n\n        But note: the rebels are fixed in space, and the bases are fixed in space. The condition is about the segments. The matching is a bijection from bases to rebels. So we can either:\n\n            Option 1: Fix the rebels and permute the bases (as above).\n            Option 2: Fix the bases and permute the rebels.\n\n        Both are equivalent. We choose Option 1.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not specify an order for the rebels. The rebels are given as a list, but the assignment does not depend on the input order. So we can use the input order for rebels and then assign the bases arbitrarily.\n\n        But note: the input order of the rebels is arbitrary. We are allowed to assign any base to any rebel, so we can consider the rebels as a set. However, the condition of non-crossing depends on the coordinates.\n\n        But wait: the rebels are fixed in the galaxy, so the coordinates are fixed. The assignment is between the fixed rebels and the fixed bases.\n\n        Therefore, we can fix the rebels in the given order and permute the bases.\n\n        However, there is a catch: the condition of non-crossing is independent of the order of the rebels. But note: the rebels are fixed points, and the segments are from base to rebel. The order of the rebels in the list is just an indexing. We are going to assign the bases arbitrarily to the rebels (so we are effectively building a matching between the two sets).\n\n        But note: the problem does not specify that the rebels must be matched in the order of increasing index. We are free to assign arbitrarily.\n\n        Therefore, the above plan is correct.\n\n    Implementation:\n\n        Step 1: Read R, B. If R != B, print \"No\" and exit.\n\n        Step 2: Read R points for rebels, then B points for bases.\n\n        Step 3: If R==0, then we have an empty matching, so output \"Yes\"? But R>=1.\n\n        Step 4: Generate all permutations of the bases (which is a list of B points). \n\n        Step 5: For each permutation:\n                Let matching_segments = []\n                For i in range(R):\n                    segment = (rebels[i], bases_perm[i])\n                    matching_segments.append(segment)\n\n                Now, check if the set of matching_segments has any two segments that intersect.\n\n                To check for intersections, we iterate over every pair (i, j) with i < j and check if segment_i and segment_j intersect.\n\n                Use the function:\n\n                    def segments_intersect(seg1, seg2):\n                        A, B = seg1\n                        C, D = seg2\n                        def ccw(A, B, C):\n                            return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n                        o1 = ccw(A, B, C)\n                        o2 = ccw(A, B, D)\n                        o3 = ccw(C, D, A)\n                        o4 = ccw(C, D, B)\n                        if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n                            return True\n                        return False\n\n                However, note: the segments are defined by two distinct endpoints, and no three colinear, so we don't need to handle colinear cases.\n\n        Step 6: If we find a permutation that has no intersecting segments, output \"Yes\" and break.\n\n        Step 7: If no permutation works, output \"No\".\n\n    But wait: is the condition that the entire set of segments must not have any two crossing? Yes.\n\n    However, note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths ... do not intersect\", so we must check every pair.\n\n    But note: the segments are non-overlapping (since no two segments share an endpoint) and the condition is that they do not cross.\n\n    However, there is another issue: the matching might be non-crossing even if we consider the entire plane? \n\n    Example: two bases and two rebels. We have two segments. They might cross or not.\n\n    Example 1: \n        Rebels: [(0,0), (2,0)]\n        Bases: [(-1,1), (3,1)]\n\n        Matching1: \n            (0,0) to (-1,1) and (2,0) to (3,1): these two segments are horizontal and do not cross.\n        Matching2:\n            (0,0) to (3,1) and (2,0) to (-1,1): these two segments cross.\n\n    So we must check both.\n\n    However, note: the problem does not require that the matching is drawn in a particular order. The condition is that the straight paths do not intersect.\n\n    Another example: \n        Rebels: [(0,0), (0,2)]\n        Bases: [(1,1), (-1,1)]\n\n        Matching1: (0,0) to (1,1) and (0,2) to (-1,1): these two segments are from (0,0) to (1,1) and (0,2) to (-1,1). Do they cross?\n\n        Let's draw: \n            Segment1: (0,0) to (1,1)\n            Segment2: (0,2) to (-1,1)\n\n        These two segments form an X? Actually, they cross at (0,1)? \n\n        Check: \n            Segment1: from (0,0) to (1,1): parametric equations: x=t, y=t, for t in [0,1].\n            Segment2: from (0,2) to (-1,1): parametric equations: x=-s, y=2-s, for s in [0,1] (if we set from (0,2) to (-1,1): then x = 0 + (-1)*(s) = -s, y = 2 + (1-2)*s = 2-s).\n\n        Set t = -s? Then t must be positive, but s is positive so t=-s is negative -> no solution.\n\n        Actually, they don't cross. Let me check by the ccw method:\n\n            Check segment1: (0,0) to (1,1) and segment2: (0,2) to (-1,1)\n\n            For segment1: (0,0) to (1,1) and point (0,2): \n                ccw((0,0),(1,1),(0,2)) = (1-0)*(2-0) - (1-0)*(0-0) = 1*2 - 1*0 = 2 >0.\n            For segment1: (0,0) to (1,1) and point (-1,1):\n                ccw((0,0),(1,1),(-1,1)) = (1-0)*(1-0) - (1-0)*(-1-0) = 1*1 - 1*(-1) = 1+1 = 2 >0.\n\n            Then for segment2: (0,2) to (-1,1) and point (0,0):\n                ccw((0,2), (-1,1), (0,0)) = (-1-0)*(0-2) - (1-2)*(0-0) = (-1)*(-2) - (-1)*0 = 2 >0.\n            For segment2: (0,2) to (-1,1) and point (1,1):\n                ccw((0,2), (-1,1), (1,1)) = (-1-0)*(1-2) - (1-2)*(1-0) = (-1)*(-1) - (-1)*(1) = 1 + 1 = 2 >0.\n\n            Then the condition: (o1 * o2) = 2*2>0 -> not negative, so they don't cross.\n\n            But wait, the condition for two segments AB and CD to cross is that the two points C and D lie on opposite sides of AB, and A and B lie on opposite sides of CD.\n\n            In our function:\n\n                o1 = ccw(A,B,C) for AB and C: here A=(0,0), B=(1,1), C=(-1,1) -> positive, and D=(0,2) -> positive. So they are on the same side.\n\n            Similarly, for CD: (0,2) to (-1,1) and A=(0,0): positive, and B=(1,1): positive. Same side.\n\n            So they don't cross.\n\n        Now, consider swapping:\n\n            Matching2: (0,0) to (-1,1) and (0,2) to (1,1)\n\n            Segment1: (0,0) to (-1,1)\n            Segment2: (0,2) to (1,1)\n\n            Check segment1: (0,0) to (-1,1) and point (0,2): \n                ccw((0,0),(-1,1),(0,2)) = (-1-0)*(2-0) - (1-0)*(0-0) = (-1)*2 - 1*0 = -2 <0.\n            Check segment1: (0,0) to (-1,1) and point (1,1):\n                ccw((0,0),(-1,1),(1,1)) = (-1-0)*(1-0) - (1-0)*(1-0) = (-1)*1 - 1*1 = -1-1 = -2 <0.\n\n            Then for segment2: (0,2) to (1,1) and point (0,0):\n                ccw((0,2),(1,1),(0,0)) = (1-0)*(0-2) - (1-2)*(0-0) = 1*(-2) - (-1)*0 = -2 <0.\n            For segment2: (0,2) to (1,1) and point (-1,1):\n                ccw((0,2),(1,1),(-1,1)) = (1-0)*(1-2) - (1-2)*(-1-0) = 1*(-1) - (-1)*(-1) = -1 -1 = -2 <0.\n\n            So again, same side. They don't cross.\n\n        But wait, let's plot:\n\n            Segment1: (0,0) to (-1,1): from bottom-left to top-leftish? Actually, from (0,0) to (-1,1) is a line with slope -1 (from (0,0) to (-1,1) is going left and up, slope = (1-0)/(-1-0) = -1).\n            Segment2: (0,2) to (1,1): from top to right-down, slope = (1-2)/(1-0) = -1.\n\n            They are two parallel lines (same slope). So they don't cross.\n\n        Now, consider:\n\n            Rebels: [(0,0), (0,2)]\n            Bases: [(-1,1), (1,1)]\n\n        Matching1: (0,0) to (-1,1) and (0,2) to (1,1) -> no crossing (parallel).\n\n        Matching2: (0,0) to (1,1) and (0,2) to (-1,1) -> no crossing (also parallel).\n\n        But wait, what if we have:\n\n            Rebels: [(0,0), (2,0)]\n            Bases: [(-1,1), (3,1)]\n\n        Matching1: (0,0) to (-1,1) and (2,0) to (3,1): two segments that are not crossing.\n\n        Matching2: (0,0) to (3,1) and (2,0) to (-1,1): \n            Segment1: (0,0) to (3,1): equation y = (1/3)x\n            Segment2: (2,0) to (-1,1): equation: from (2,0) to (-1,1): slope = (1-0)/(-1-2) = 1/-3 = -1/3, so y = (-1/3)(x-2)\n\n            Solve: (1/3)x = (-1/3)(x-2) => x = -x+2 => 2x=2 => x=1, then y=1/3.\n\n            So they cross at (1,1/3). Therefore, they cross.\n\n        Now, using our function:\n\n            seg1 = (0,0) to (3,1)\n            seg2 = (2,0) to (-1,1)\n\n            Check for seg1: \n                For point (2,0): \n                    ccw((0,0),(3,1),(2,0)) = (3-0)*(0-0) - (1-0)*(2-0) = 3*0 - 1*2 = -2 <0.\n                For point (-1,1):\n                    ccw((0,0),(3,1),(-1,1)) = (3-0)*(1-0) - (1-0)*(-1-0) = 3*1 - 1*(-1) = 3+1 = 4 >0.\n\n            Then for seg2: \n                For point (0,0):\n                    ccw((2,0),(-1,1),(0,0)) = (-1-2)*(0-0) - (1-0)*(0-2) = (-3)*0 - 1*(-2) = 2 >0.\n                For point (3,1):\n                    ccw((2,0),(-1,1),(3,1)) = (-1-2)*(1-0) - (1-0)*(3-2) = (-3)*1 - 1*1 = -3-1 = -4 <0.\n\n            Then (o1 * o2) = (-2)*4 = negative, and (o3 * o4) = (2)*(-4) = negative -> wait, no: the condition is (o1 * o2 <0) and (o3 * o4 <0) -> here (o1 * o2) is negative and (o3 * o4) is negative, so condition holds -> they cross.\n\n        So the function returns True (intersect) for the crossing case.\n\n    Therefore, the function is correct.\n\n    However, note: the condition for two segments to cross is that the points of one segment are on opposite sides of the other segment and vice versa. The above function returns True if both conditions hold.\n\n    But wait: in the condition we have:\n\n        if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n            return True\n\n    This is correct.\n\n    Now, let's code accordingly.\n\n    However, note: the order of the points in the segment matters for the ccw function. The ccw function assumes a particular order. The standard ccw function for three points A, B, C returns positive if C is to the left of the line AB.\n\n    We must be consistent: the segments are defined by two endpoints, and we pass the two endpoints in the same order for the segment.\n\n    But note",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between a set of Rebel spaceships and bases such that the straight-line segments connecting each base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of assigning bases to spaceships and verifying the non-intersection condition for each permutation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Validation**: First, check if the number of Rebels (R) equals the number of bases (B). If not, output \"No\" immediately since a perfect matching is impossible.\n2. **Reading Input**: Read the coordinates of the Rebels and bases from the input.\n3. **Permutation Generation**: Generate all possible permutations of the bases. Each permutation represents a potential assignment of bases to Rebels.\n4. **Non-Intersection Check**: For each permutation, create segments connecting each Rebel to its assigned base. Check if any two segments intersect by using the cross-product method to determine the orientation of points relative to each other.\n5. **Early Termination**: If any permutation satisfies the non-intersection condition, output \"Yes\" and terminate. If no such permutation is found after checking all possibilities, output \"No\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    it = iter(data)\n    R = int(next(it)); B = int(next(it))\n    \n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x = int(next(it)); y = int(next(it))\n        rebels.append((x, y))\n        \n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x = int(next(it)); y = int(next(it))\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        \n    if R == 0:\n        print(\"Yes\")\n        return\n        \n    def ccw(A, B, C):\n        return (B[0] - A[0]) * (C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1]) * (C[0] - A[0])\n        \n    def segments_intersect(seg1, seg2):\n        A, B = seg1\n        C, D = seg2\n        o1 = ccw(A, B, C)\n        o2 = ccw(A, B, D)\n        o3 = ccw(C, D, A)\n        o4 = ccw(C, D, B)\n        if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n            return True\n        return False\n        \n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        n = len(perm)\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i+1, n):\n                seg1 = (rebels[i], perm[j])\n                seg2 = (rebels[j], perm[i])\n                if segments_intersect(seg1, seg2):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n                \n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n            \n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed into integers R and B, followed by the coordinates of the Rebels and bases.\n2. **Immediate Check**: If the counts of Rebels and bases differ, the solution immediately outputs \"No\" since a perfect matching is not possible.\n3. **Cross Product Calculation**: The `ccw` function calculates the cross product to determine the orientation of three points, which helps in checking if points are collinear or to determine the relative positions of points.\n4. **Segment Intersection Check**: The `segments_intersect` function uses the cross product results to check if two line segments intersect by verifying if the endpoints of one segment lie on opposite sides of the other segment.\n5. **Permutation Check**: For each permutation of base assignments, the code checks all pairs of segments for intersections. If any permutation yields no intersections, it prints \"Yes\" and exits; otherwise, after all permutations are checked, it prints \"No\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible assignments by leveraging permutations and geometric properties to ensure no intersecting paths, providing the correct answer for the given problem constraints.",
