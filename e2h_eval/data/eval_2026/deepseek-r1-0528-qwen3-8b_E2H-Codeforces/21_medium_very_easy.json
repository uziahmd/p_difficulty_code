The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to use the condition: a_i + b_j is odd => (a_i % 2) != (b_j % 2)\n Therefore, we can separate the chests and keys by their parity.\n\n Let:\n   Chestes_even = number of chests with a_i even\n   Chestes_odd = number of chests with a_i odd\n\n   Keys_even = number of keys with b_j even\n   Keys_odd = number of keys with b_j odd\n\n Now, note that an even chest can only be opened by an odd key, and an odd chest can only be opened by an even key.\n\n So, we have two bipartite graphs (or two independent matching problems):\n\n 1. Even chests and odd keys: maximum matching is min(Chestes_even, Keys_odd)\n 2. Odd chests and even keys: maximum matching is min(Chestes_odd, Keys_even)\n\n However, we cannot use the same key twice, so we must consider that the total matching is the sum of the two matchings?\n\n But wait: the two sets are disjoint. The problem is that one key is either even or odd, and one chest is either even or odd.\n\n Actually, we are allowed to use each key at most once and each chest at most once.\n\n The entire matching will consist of two independent parts:\n\n   - Use odd keys to open even chests (if available)\n   - Use even keys to open odd chests (if available)\n\n But note: there is no overlap between the two conditions. So the total maximum chests we can open is:\n\n   total = min(Chestes_even, Keys_odd) + min(Chestes_odd, Keys_even)\n\n However, let me test with the first example:\n\n   Input: \"5 4\", then chests [9, 14, 6, 2, 11] and keys [8, 4, 7, 20]\n\n   Chests: \n        9 -> odd\n        14 -> even\n        6 -> even\n        2 -> even\n        11 -> odd\n\n   So, Chestes_even = 3, Chestes_odd = 2.\n\n   Keys:\n        8 -> even\n        4 -> even\n        7 -> odd\n        20 -> even\n\n   Keys_even = 3, Keys_odd = 1.\n\n   Then, \n        min(3, 1) = 1 (even chests matched with odd keys)\n        min(2, 3) = 2 (odd chests matched with even keys)\n\n   Total = 1 + 2 = 3, which matches the example.\n\n Second example:\n\n   Input: \"5 1\", chests [2,4,6,8,10] (all even), keys [5] (odd)\n\n   Chestes_even = 5, Chestes_odd = 0.\n   Keys_even = 0, Keys_odd = 1.\n\n   min(5,1)=1, min(0,0)=0 -> total=1.\n\n Third example:\n\n   Input: \"1 4\", chest [10] (even), keys [20,30,40,50] (all even)\n\n   Chestes_even=1, Chestes_odd=0; Keys_even=4, Keys_odd=0.\n   min(1,0)=0, min(0,4)=0 -> total=0.\n\n So the solution is to count the even and odd in both chests and keys.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Read n, m.\n   Read list of n integers for chests.\n   Read list of m integers for keys.\n\n   Count:\n        even_chest = number of even numbers in the chest list\n        odd_chest = n - even_chest\n\n        even_key = number of even numbers in the key list\n        odd_key = m - even_key\n\n   Then, result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n\n   Print result.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This translates to the condition that an even-numbered chest must be opened by an odd-numbered key, and vice versa.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests and keys based on parity (even or odd). The solution involves counting the number of even and odd numbered chests and keys separately.\n2. **Insight**: An even-numbered chest can only be opened by an odd-numbered key, and an odd-numbered chest can only be opened by an even-numbered key. Therefore, the maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of:\n   - The minimum of the number of even-numbered chests and the number of odd-numbered keys.\n   - The minimum of the number of odd-numbered chests and the number of even-numbered keys.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves counting the even and odd values in both the chest and key lists. The result is then computed by combining the two minimum values as described above.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves linear scans of the input lists to count even and odd numbers, resulting in an O(n + m) time complexity, where n and m are the number of chests and keys, respectively. This is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n            \n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n            \n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests (n) and keys (m), followed by the numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Values**: The code counts how many chests and keys have even numbers. The remaining chests and keys are considered odd.\n3. **Calculating Maximum Open Chests**: The solution calculates the maximum number of chests that can be opened by matching even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys. The result is the sum of the two possible matches, each being the minimum of the respective counts.\n4. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the maximum number of chests Neko can open under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages parity checks to maximize the number of chests opened without exceeding the available keys, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
