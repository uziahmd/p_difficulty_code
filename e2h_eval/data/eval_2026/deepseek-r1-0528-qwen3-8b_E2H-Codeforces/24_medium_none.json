She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n The idea is to consider that we only need to leave the tabs [l, r] open. \n There are two types of operations: moving the cursor (left/right by one, but note the boundaries change as tabs are closed) and closing all tabs to the left or right.\n\n However, note that the problem can be simplified by considering the following:\n\n Since we start with all tabs from 1 to n and we want to leave [l, r], we must close:\n   - All tabs with index < l (to the left of l)\n   - All tabs with index > r (to the right of r)\n\n But note: we might have the cursor initially at `pos`. \n\n We can break down the problem into two parts: \n   Part 1: Closing the left part (tabs < l)\n   Part 2: Closing the right part (tabs > r)\n\n However, sometimes we can do both in one go if the cursor is positioned appropriately.\n\n Observations:\n\n Case 1: If the entire segment [1, n] is already [l, r] (i.e., l==1 and r==n), then we don't need to do anything -> 0 seconds.\n\n Case 2: We might need to move the cursor to a certain position to close the left part, then move again to close the right part.\n\n But note: after closing some tabs, the boundaries a and b change. However, we can plan the operations optimally.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let's define:\n   left_closing_required = (if there are tabs to the left of l) i.e., if l > 1 then we need to close left.\n   right_closing_required = (if there are tabs to the right of r) i.e., if r < n then we need to close right.\n\n However, the operations allow:\n   - Moving one step at a time (but the boundaries for movement become the current min and max unclosed tabs)\n   - Closing all tabs to the left (so that the new minimum tab becomes the current cursor's tab, effectively removing everything left of the cursor)\n   - Similarly, closing all tabs to the right.\n\n But note: the problem does not require to leave the cursor at any particular place.\n\n Steps:\n\n Option 1: We can first close the left part and then the right part, or vice versa.\n\n However, we can also consider:\n\n   Option A: Close the left part and then the right part.\n        Steps for left part: \n            Move the cursor from `pos` to `l` (if `pos` is to the right of `l`, then we move left until we hit `l`; but note: we don't necessarily need to go all the way to `l` because we can close the left part from somewhere between `l` and `r`? Actually, to close the left part we must be at a tab >= l (because if we are at a tab < l, then the left part doesn't include any tab beyond the current one, but wait: the operation \"close all to the left\" will remove everything from the current minimum (which is the smallest unclosed tab) to the left of the cursor. However, if we haven't closed the left part yet, then the minimum unclosed tab is still 1. So to close the left part (all tabs < l) we must have the cursor at a tab >= l, and then we can close the left part.\n\n        Actually, to close the left part (all tabs from 1 to l-1) we must be at a tab that is at least l (so that the closure from the left removes up to l-1). Similarly, to close the right part (all tabs from r+1 to n) we must be at a tab <= r.\n\n        Therefore, we have to move the cursor to a position in [l, r] (or even beyond? but beyond would be already closed) but note: the closure operation requires being on a tab that is in the range [a, b] (the current unclosed tabs). \n\n        Actually, we can break the problem:\n\n        Let required_left_moves = 0\n        Let required_right_moves = 0\n\n        Possibilities:\n\n        Case 1: The entire set of tabs is already [l, r]. Then answer=0.\n\n        Case 2: We have to close the left part and/or the right part.\n\n        How can we close the left part?\n          - We must get the cursor to a tab that is at least l (so that the closure operation removes everything to the left). Then we can perform a left-close.\n\n        Similarly, for the right part, we must get the cursor to a tab at most r.\n\n        But note: we might combine the two operations.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        Option 1: First close the left part, then the right part.\n\n          Step 1: Move from `pos` to `l` (if `pos` is greater than `l`). But actually, we might not need to go all the way to `l`? Consider: if we are at a position `x` (>=l) then we can close the left part. So we need to move to the left until we are at a tab >= l. The number of moves needed to get from `pos` to the leftmost necessary point (which is `l`) is `max(0, pos - l)`.\n\n          Then, after closing the left part, the remaining tabs are from `l` to `n`. Now, we need to close the right part. For that, we must be at a tab <= r. Currently, we are at `l` (after moving). Then we need to move to the right until we reach `r`? Or maybe we can stay at `l` and then close the right part? But wait: if we are at `l` and there are tabs from `r+1` to `n`, then we need to move to `r` (if `r` is less than the current cursor position? no, because we are at `l` and `l` might be less than `r`). Actually, to close the right part we must be at a tab <= r. But if we are at `l` (which is <= r) then we are already in the correct side. However, we might have to move from `l` to `r` if we want to minimize the total moves? Or wait, we can also consider: after closing the left part, the entire segment [l, n] remains, so we need to close the right part. To close the right part we can just be at any tab <= r. So we don't necessarily need to go to `r`? Actually, we can close the right part from anywhere in [l, n] as long as we are <= r. But if we are at `l` (which is <= r) then we can do a right-close without moving. However, wait: the operation \"close all to the right\" requires that we are at a tab i such that we close [i+1, b] (where b is the maximum unclosed tab). After closing the left part, the maximum unclosed tab is still n (unless we close the right part too). But we don't have to move to close the right part from `l`? \n\n          Actually, the operation is defined as: from the current tab i, we can close all the tabs to the right (from i+1 to b). This will remove everything from i+1 to the end. But we want to remove everything from r+1 to n. If we are at `l` (which is <= r), then when we close the right part from `l`, it will remove from `l+1` to `n`. But we don't want to remove `l` to `r`! \n\n          Correction: The operation \"close all the tabs to the right\" does not necessarily remove up to n, but only from the next tab to the current cursor to the current maximum unclosed tab. However, we want to remove only the ones beyond r. \n\n          Actually, the problem says: we want to leave the tabs [l, r] open. So we must not remove any tab in [l, r]. \n\n          Therefore, to close the right part, we must be at a tab that is <= r, and then the operation \"close all the tabs to the right\" will remove from the next tab to the current cursor to the current maximum (which is n until we remove). But wait: after closing the left part, the remaining tabs are [l, n]. Then we are at `l`. When we close the right part from `l`, we remove from `l+1` to `n`. That leaves [l] and then we still have [l+1, r] (if any) to keep? No, because we removed everything from `l+1` to `n`, so we only leave [l]. That is not what we want.\n\n          So we must be cautious. \n\n          Actually, the problem states: we can close all the tabs to the left OR to the right. And the goal is to leave exactly [l, r].\n\n          Therefore, to close the right part without affecting [l, r] we must close from a position that is at most r. But if we are at `l`, then closing the right part will remove everything from `l+1` to `n`, which includes [l+1, r] (if r>l) and we don't want that.\n\n          Hence, we must not close the right part from `l` if there are any tabs in [l+1, r] that we wish to keep.\n\n          Similarly, for the left part: if we are at `l` and we close the left part, then we remove everything from the current minimum (which is `l` at the moment? Actually, no: initially the minimum was 1, but after closing the left part we remove everything from 1 to l-1. Then the current minimum becomes `l`. Then we are at `l`, and then we can move to the right and close the right part from a position that is at most r.\n\n        Revised plan:\n\n        We need to remove two sets: {1, 2, ..., l-1} and {r+1, r+2, ..., n}. We can do:\n\n          Operation 1: Move the cursor to a tab in [l, r] (if necessary) and then close the left part (if needed). Then move the cursor to a tab in [l, r] (if necessary) and then close the right part (if needed).\n\n        However, we can also consider doing:\n\n          Operation 1: Move to the rightmost tab that is <= r (which is r) to prepare for closing the right part, then close the right part. Then move to the leftmost tab (l) to close the left part.\n\n        But note: we might be able to do the operations in a smarter way.\n\n        Actually, the problem can be broken into:\n\n          Let left_side = (l-1)   [number of tabs to the left of l]\n          Let right_side = (n-r)  [number of tabs to the right of r]\n\n        But the operations are not just about the number of tabs but about moving the cursor.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think of the following:\n\n        We have two operations: left-close and right-close. Each operation requires that the cursor is in the correct side (>=l for left-close, <=r for right-close). \n\n        Steps:\n\n        Option 1: First, if we need to close the left part, we must move the cursor from `pos` to the left until we are at a tab >= l (if `pos` is to the left of l, then we cannot close the left part until we move to the right first? Actually, no: if `pos` is to the left of l, then we are in the part we want to keep? No, wait: if `pos` is to the left of l, then we are in the left part that we wish to close? But we want to leave [l, r]. So if `pos` is < l, then we are in the part we must close. However, we cannot close the left part from a tab that is not >= l. \n\n        Let me restate: to close the left part (tabs < l) we must be at a tab i such that i>=l. Similarly, to close the right part (tabs > r) we must be at a tab i such that i<=r.\n\n        Therefore, we must move the cursor to a tab in [l, r] to perform either operation.\n\n        So the process is:\n\n          Step 1: Move the cursor to a tab in [l, r] (if it's not already there). The minimal moves to get from `pos` to the segment [l, r] is:\n\n            If `pos` is already in [l, r]: 0.\n\n            Else if `pos` < l: then we need to move right until we reach l (so moves = l - pos).\n            Else if `pos` > r: then we need to move left until we reach r (so moves = pos - r).\n\n          Then, we can choose to close one or both sides.\n\n        But note: after closing one side, the segment [l, r] is still present, but the boundaries change (the left-close operation sets the new minimum to the current cursor's tab, so if we close the left part from a tab i (>=l), then the remaining tabs are [i, n] (if we were at i, then the left-close removes from the current minimum (which is the smallest index, which was 1) to i-1). But wait, the operation \"close all to the left\" from tab i (with i>=l) removes everything from the current minimum (which is the smallest index of the unclosed tabs) to i-1. Initially, the current minimum is 1. After closing the left part, the new minimum becomes i (since we removed everything from 1 to i-1). \n\n        However, note: we want to leave [l, r]. So we must ensure that the closure operations do not remove any part of [l, r]. \n\n        Therefore, we must close the left part only when we are at a tab i>=l, and then we remove everything from the current minimum (which is 1) to i-1. This is safe because i>=l, so we remove everything from 1 to i-1, and i is at least l, so we are leaving [i, ...] which includes [l, ...] (since i>=l). But wait: if i > l, then we are leaving [i, ...] and we still have the part [l, i-1] (which we wanted to keep) still open. That's not good.\n\n        Correction: We must close the left part from a tab that is exactly l? Because if we are at a tab i (>=l) and we close the left part, we remove from 1 to i-1. Then the remaining tabs are [i, n]. But we want [l, r]. So we must have i = l, because if i>l then [l, i-1] is still open (and we didn't want to keep [l, i-1] because we are going to close the right part? Actually, no: we want to keep [l, r]. So if we close the left part from a tab i (>=l), then we remove everything from 1 to i-1. This is acceptable only if i-1 <= l-1, i.e., i <= l. But i>=l, so i must be l.\n\n        Similarly, for the right part: we must close the right part from a tab i (<=r) and we must have i = r.\n\n        Therefore, to close the left part, we must move the cursor to l (if we are not already there). Then we close the left part. Then, to close the right part, we must move the cursor to r (if we are not already there). Then we close the right part.\n\n        However, note: after closing the left part, the cursor is at l, and then we need to move to r (if we haven't been there). Then we close the right part.\n\n        But wait: what if we close the right part first? Then we must move to r, then close the right part, then move to l (if we are not already there) and close the left part.\n\n        Also, note: we might be able to use the same movement to prepare for both? \n\n        Let me consider:\n\n          We start at `pos`.\n\n          We have two tasks: \n            Task1: Move to l (if we haven't) to close the left part.\n            Task2: Move to r (if we haven't) to close the right part.\n\n          However, if we start at `pos`:\n\n          If `pos` is in [l, r]:\n            Then we can do:\n              Option A: \n                Move to l (if needed) then close left, then move to r (if needed) then close right.\n                But note: we are already in [l, r] so we don't need to move for the initial step.\n\n          Actually, we can break the problem into:\n\n          Let steps = 0.\n\n          Case 1: If l == 1 and r == n: 0.\n\n          Case 2: Otherwise, we must do two closure operations (if both sides are present). But note: we might have only one side to close.\n\n          However, the operations are independent. \n\n          Steps:\n\n          Option 1: Without considering the order:\n\n          We must eventually visit:\n            - The left boundary (l) if we are to close the left part.\n            - The right boundary (r) if we are to close the right part.\n\n          But note: we can also close the left part from a position greater than l? Actually, we saw that if we are at a position i (>=l) we can close the left part, but then the closure would remove everything from 1 to i-1. However, we want to keep [l, r]. So if i > l, then [l, i-1] is kept and we haven't closed the left part completely (we left [l, i-1] open). Therefore, we must close the left part from exactly l.\n\n          Similarly, for the right part: we must close from exactly r.\n\n          Therefore, the plan is:\n\n          Step 1: Move the cursor to l (if necessary) and then close the left part (if needed). \n          Step 2: Move the cursor to r (if necessary) and then close the right part (if needed).\n\n          But note: we might be able to combine the movements. \n\n          Example: \n            Input: \"6 3 2 4\"\n\n            Here, n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\n            We need to close the left part (tab1) and the right part (tabs5,6).\n\n            Step 1: We are at 3. We need to close the left part, so we must move to 2 (which is the left boundary). Then we close the left part (removes tab1). Then we must move to 4 (right boundary) to close the right part.\n\n            Steps: \n              Move from 3 to 2: 1 second.\n              Close left: 1 second.\n              Move from 2 to 4: 2 seconds (because we can move one step at a time, and the boundaries change: after closing the left part, the minimum index is now 2, so we can move from 2 to 3 to 4). But wait, the problem allows moving to the left or right as long as we don't go beyond the current minimum and maximum. After closing the left part, the minimum is 2 and maximum is 6. So we can move from 2 to 3 to 4 (two moves). Then close the right part: 1 second.\n\n            Total: 1 (move left) + 1 (close left) + 2 (move right) + 1 (close right) = 5.\n\n            But the example output is 5.\n\n          Another example: \n            Input: \"6 3 1 3\"\n\n            Here, we need to close the right part (tabs4,5,6). The left part is already gone (l=1, so no left part to close).\n\n            Steps: \n              We are at 3, which is the right boundary (r=3). So we don't need to move for the right part. Then we close the right part: 1 second.\n\n            Total: 1.\n\n            Output: 1.\n\n          Another example: \n            Input: \"5 2 1 5\"\n\n            Entire set is kept, so 0.\n\n          But wait, in the example \"6 3 1 3\", we are at 3 (which is the right boundary). Then we can close the right part from 3. But the operation \"close all to the right\" from 3 will remove from 4 to 6. That is correct.\n\n          However, consider if we were not at the boundary? \n\n          Example: \n            n=6, pos=4, l=2, r=4.\n\n            We need to close the left part (tabs1) and the right part (tabs5,6). \n\n            Step 1: We are at 4. To close the left part, we must be at 2. So we move left from 4 to 2: 2 moves. Then close the left part: 1 move. Then we need to close the right part: we must be at 4 (the right boundary). We are at 2, so we move from 2 to 4: 2 moves. Then close the right part: 1 move.\n\n            Total: 2+1+2+1 = 6.\n\n          But is there a better way?\n\n          What if we close the right part first? \n\n            Start at 4. To close the right part, we must be at 4 (already there). Then we close the right part (remove 5,6). Then we need to close the left part: we must be at 2. We are at 4, so we move from 4 to 2: 2 moves. Then close the left part: 1 move.\n\n            Total: 1 (close right) + 2 (move left) + 1 (close left) = 4.\n\n          So the order matters.\n\n          Therefore, we should consider:\n\n          We have two operations: left-close and right-close, each requiring to be at the boundary (l for left-close, r for right-close).\n\n          The total cost is:\n\n            cost = (distance from start to l) + 1 (for left-close) + (distance from l to r) + 1 (for right-close)   [if we do left-close first]\n\n            OR\n\n            cost = (distance from start to r) + 1 (for right-close) + (distance from r to l) + 1 (for left-close)   [if we do right-close first]\n\n          But note: the distances are the absolute differences? \n\n          However, the movement is constrained by the boundaries. But note: we are allowed to move one step at a time, and the boundaries change as we close tabs. \n\n          Actually, the minimal number of moves to go from a to b is |a-b|, because we can always move one step per second and the boundaries are expanding or contracting appropriately? \n\n          Why? Because when we close one side, the boundaries change, but the movement is always along the current available tabs. However, the closure operations do not block the movement: the movement is defined by the current minimum and maximum, but note:\n\n          - When we close the left part, the minimum becomes the cursor's position (l) and the maximum remains until we close the right part. Then, when we move from l to r, we are moving in an interval [l, n] (with n unchanged until we close the right part). Similarly, if we close the right part first, then the maximum becomes r, and then we move from r to l in the interval [1, r] (but wait, if we closed the right part first, then the left part is still open, so the minimum is 1 and maximum is r). \n\n          However, the movement from one tab to another is always the absolute difference because the tabs are contiguous and the movement is one step at a time. The boundaries (min and max) do not prevent moving within the current unclosed tabs, and since we are only concerned with the number of moves (each move is one second) and the path is linear, the minimal moves from a to b is |a-b|.\n\n          Therefore, the cost for moving from x to y is |x-y|.\n\n          Then, we can compute:\n\n          Option 1: Close left then right.\n\n            Steps = |pos - l| + 1 + |l - r| + 1\n\n          Option 2: Close right then left.\n\n            Steps = |pos - r| + 1 + |r - l| + 1\n\n          Then, the answer is the minimum of these two options, but wait: what if we don't need to close one of them?\n\n          Conditions:\n\n          - If l == 1, then we don't need to close the left part (no tabs to the left of l). Similarly, if r == n, then no tabs to the right.\n\n          Therefore, we have:\n\n          if l == 1 and r == n:\n              ans = 0\n          else:\n              if l == 1:   # then we only need to close the right part\n                  ans = abs(pos - r) + 1\n              elif r == n: # then we only need to close the left part\n                  ans = abs(pos - l) + 1\n              else: \n                  option1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1\n                  option2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1\n                  ans = min(option1, option2)\n\n          But wait, in the example \"6 3 1 3\": \n            n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3.\n\n            Then, since l==1, we do: ans = |3-3| + 1 = 0+1 = 1. Correct.\n\n          Example \"5 2 1 5\": \n            l=1, r=5 (which equals n) -> but wait, n=5, so r==n. Then we would do: if l==1 and r==n: then 0. Correct.\n\n          But what if both sides are present and we are in the middle? \n\n          Example: n=10, pos=5, l=2, r=9.\n\n          Option1: \n            |5-2| = 3, then +1 (close left), then |2-9|=7, then +1 (close right) -> 3+1+7+1 = 12.\n\n          Option2:\n            |5-9|=4, then +1 (close right), then |9-2|=7, then +1 (close left) -> 4+1+7+1 = 13.\n\n          Then answer=12.\n\n          But is 12 the minimal? \n\n          However, note: after closing one side, we don't necessarily have to go back from the boundary to the other boundary. In the above, we did:\n\n            Option1: Start at 5, go to 2 (3 moves), close left, then from 2 go to 9 (7 moves), close right.\n\n          But wait: after closing the left part, the boundaries are [2,10]. Then we can move from 2 to 9 in 7 moves. Similarly, after closing the right part, the boundaries are [1,9] and then we move from 9 to 2 in 7 moves.\n\n          But is there a possibility to do less?\n\n          Alternative: Maybe we don't have to go to the exact boundary? \n\n          However, we argued that we must be at l to close the left part and at r to close the right part.\n\n          But note: what if we close the left part from a tab between l and r? Then we remove everything to the left, but we must be at l. Actually, we must be at a tab >= l, but then the closure from a tab i (>=l) removes from 1 to i-1. However, if i>l, then we haven't removed everything from 1 to l-1? Actually, we have, because we remove from 1 to i-1. But if i>l, then we remove from 1 to i-1, which includes [1, l-1] (since i-1>=l-1). So that is acceptable. \n\n          However, wait: the definition of the closure operation: \n            \"close all the tabs to the left of the cursor\" -> removes [a, i-1] where a is the current minimum (which is the smallest index of the unclosed tabs). \n\n          Initially, a=1. So if we are at i (>=l) then we remove [1, i-1]. This is acceptable because we want to remove [1, l-1] (and more if i-1>=l-1). But note: we don't mind removing more? Actually, we want to remove exactly the tabs that are not in [l, r]. Removing [1, i-1] is acceptable as long as i>=l (because then [1, i-1] contains [1, l-1] and maybe [l, i-1] if i>l, but [l, i-1] is part of [l, r] (if i<=r) or not (if i>r)? \n\n          Actually, if i>r, then [l, i-1] might extend beyond r? \n\n          Let me clarify: We want to leave [l, r]. \n\n          After closing the left part from a tab i (>=l), we remove [1, i-1]. Then the remaining tabs are [i, n]. Then we must remove the right part [r+1, n] and also we must keep [l, r]. \n\n          But if i>r, then the remaining tabs [i, n] does not include [l, i-1] (which includes [l, r] if i-1>=r). \n\n          Actually, if i>r, then we have removed [1, i-1] which includes [1, r] (if i-1>=r, i.e., i>=r+1). Then the remaining tabs are [i, n] (which is [r+1, n]) and we haven't achieved our goal.\n\n          Therefore, we must close the left part from a tab i that is in [l, r]. Similarly for the right part.\n\n          But wait: we want to remove only the tabs that are not in [l, r]. \n\n          How can we do that?\n\n          Actually, the operation \"close all the tabs to the left\" removes everything from the current minimum to the cursor's left. We want to remove [1, l-1] and [r+1, n]. \n\n          We can do:\n\n            Step 1: Remove the left part: we must be at a tab i such that i>=l and i<=r (so that the closure doesn't remove any part of [l, r]). Then we remove [1, i-1]. This is safe if i-1 < l? Actually, no: if i>=l then i-1>=l-1, so we remove [1, i-1] which includes [1, l-1] (good) and also [l, i-1] (if i-1>=l). But [l, i-1] is part of [l, r] (if i-1<=r) then we are removing part of [l, r]! \n\n          This is a problem.\n\n          Therefore, we must not remove any part of [l, r]. \n\n          The operation \"close all the tabs to the left\" removes [a, i-1] (from the current minimum a to i-1). We want to remove [1, l-1] and nothing else. \n\n          How can we do that?\n\n          We can only remove the left part from a tab i = l. Then we remove [1, l-1] (exactly the left part) and the remaining tabs are [l, n]. Then we can remove the right part from a tab j = r (then we remove [r+1, n]).\n\n          Similarly, for the right part: we must close from exactly r.\n\n          Therefore, the boundaries for the closure operations are fixed: we must be at l to close the left part, and at r to close the right part.\n\n          So the above formula holds.\n\n          But wait: what if we are already at l or r? \n\n          Example: n=10, pos=2 (which is l), then we can close the left part immediately (without moving) and then move to r to close the right part.\n\n          Steps: \n            Start at 2 (l). \n            Close left: 1 second.\n            Then move from 2 to 9 (if r=9): |2-9|=7 seconds, then close right: 1 second.\n            Total: 0 (no initial move) + 1 + 7 + 1 = 9.\n\n          Alternatively, if we are at r (say pos=9) and we want to close the left part first:\n\n            Start at 9, move to 2: 7 seconds, close left: 1, then close right: 1 (since we are at 2, but we don't need to move for the right part? Actually, to close the right part we must be at r (9). So after closing left, we are at 2, then we must move from 2 to 9: 7 seconds, then close right: 1.\n\n            Total: 7+1+7+1 = 16.\n\n          But wait, we can do the right part first: \n            Start at 9, close right: 1 second (because we are at 9, which is r). Then move to 2: 7 seconds, close left: 1 second.\n\n            Total: 1+7+1 = 9.\n\n          So the minimal is 9.\n\n          Now, according to our formula:\n\n            Option1 (left then right): \n              |9-2| + 1 + |2-9| + 1 = 7+1+7+1 = 16.\n\n            Option2 (right then left):\n              |9-9| + 1 + |9-2| + 1 = 0+1+7+1 = 9.\n\n          Therefore, we take the minimum of the two.\n\n          But note: in the above example, we started at 9 (r). We don't need to move for the right part, but we do need to move for the left part.\n\n          So the formula is:\n\n          if l == 1 and r == n:\n              ans = 0\n          elif l == 1:\n              ans = abs(pos - r) + 1\n          elif r == n:\n              ans = abs(pos - l) + 1\n          else:\n              # Both sides to close\n              option1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1\n              option2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1\n              ans = min(option1, option2)\n\n          However, wait: in the case when we don't need to close one side, we don't require moving to the opposite boundary. \n\n          But note: in the example \"6 3 1 3\", we are at 3 and we only need to close the right part (because l=1, so no left part). Then we move from 3 to 3 (0) and then close the right part (1 second). \n\n          But what if we are not at the boundary for the side we need to close? \n\n          Example: n=10, pos=4, l=1, r=3 (so we only need to close the right part). Then we must be at r=3 to close the right part. So we move from 4 to 3 (1 second) and then close the right part (1 second). Total=2.\n\n          According to the formula: abs(4-3)+1 = 1+1 = 2.\n\n          Now, consider a mixed case: we have to close one side and the other side is not present, but we are not at the boundary.\n\n          But wait, if we only need to close the right part (because l==1) then we must move to r (if we aren't there) and then close.\n\n          Similarly, if we only need to close the left part (because r==n) then we must move to l (if we aren't there) and then close.\n\n          However, note: what if we are already at the boundary for the side we need to close? Then we don't need to move.\n\n          The formula accounts for that: abs(pos - boundary) is 0 if we are already at the boundary.\n\n          Therefore, the code is:\n\n          Read input: n, pos, l, r\n\n          if l == 1 and r == n:\n              print(0)\n          elif l == 1:\n              # Only need to close the right part\n              moves = abs(pos - r) + 1\n              print(moves)\n          elif r == n:\n              # Only need to close the left part\n              moves = abs(pos - l) + 1\n              print(moves)\n          else:\n              # Both sides need to be closed\n              option1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1\n              option2 = abs",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] in her browser. The browser starts with n tabs, and the cursor is initially at position `pos`. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right by one tab per second or closing all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r], Luba must either close the left part (tabs < l) or the right part (tabs > r) or both. The operations to close these parts require the cursor to be positioned at specific tabs: \n   - To close the left part, the cursor must be at tab `l`.\n   - To close the right part, the cursor must be at tab `r`.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves two main scenarios:\n   - **Single Side Closure**: If only one side (left or right) needs to be closed, the minimal steps are the distance from the initial cursor position to the boundary (l or r) plus one second for the closure operation.\n   - **Both Sides Closure**: If both sides need to be closed, the minimal steps are the minimum of two options:\n     - Option 1: Move to `l`, close the left part, then move to `r`, and close the right part.\n     - Option 2: Move to `r`, close the right part, then move to `l`, and close the left part.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm calculates the required steps based on the initial cursor position and the boundaries of the segment [l, r]. The solution efficiently checks the conditions and computes the minimal steps using absolute differences for movement and simple arithmetic for closure operations.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves basic arithmetic operations and conditional checks, making it O(1) in time and space complexity, which is optimal for the given constraints (n ≤ 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n    elif l == 1:\n        moves = abs(pos - r) + 1\n        print(moves)\n    elif r == n:\n        moves = abs(pos - l) + 1\n        print(moves)\n    else:\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1\n        print(min(option1, option2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: The code reads four integers: `n` (number of tabs), `pos` (initial cursor position), `l` (left boundary of the segment), and `r` (right boundary of the segment).\n- **Special Case Handling**: If the entire range of tabs (1 to n) is already within [l, r], no operations are needed, so the answer is 0.\n- **Single Side Closure**: If only the left or right part needs closing (checked via `l == 1` or `r == n`), the answer is the distance from the initial position to the respective boundary plus one second for the closure.\n- **Both Sides Closure**: For both sides needing closure, the code calculates two options (moving left first or right first) and selects the minimal steps between them. Each option includes movement to the boundary, a closure operation, and movement to the other boundary if necessary.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures the minimal operations are computed with optimal performance.",
