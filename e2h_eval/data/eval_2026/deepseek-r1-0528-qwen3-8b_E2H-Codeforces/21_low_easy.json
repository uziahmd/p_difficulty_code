The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to use the condition: a_i + b_j is odd => (a_i % 2) != (b_j % 2)\n Therefore, we can separate the chests and keys by parity.\n\n Let:\n   Chestes_even = number of chests with even a_i\n   Chestes_odd = number of chests with odd a_i\n\n Similarly for keys:\n   Keys_even = number of keys with even b_j\n   Keys_odd = number of keys with odd b_j\n\n Now, note that an even chest can only be opened by an odd key, and an odd chest can only be opened by an even key.\n\n So, we have two bipartite graphs:\n   - Even chests can be matched with odd keys.\n   - Odd chests can be matched with even keys.\n\n But note: we cannot use a key twice. So the maximum matching from even chests to odd keys is limited by the minimum of (number of even chests, number of odd keys). Similarly, the maximum matching from odd chests to even keys is limited by the minimum of (number of odd chests, number of even keys).\n\n However, we are allowed to use at most one key per chest and vice versa, and we are also constrained by the total number of keys and chests.\n\n But wait: is there any overlap? Actually, the two sets of matches (even-chest with odd-key and odd-chest with even-key) are independent. The total chests we can open is the sum of the two independent matchings.\n\n However, note that the same key cannot be used twice. But in our separation, we are using two disjoint sets of keys (odd keys for even chests, even keys for odd chests). Since the keys are separated by parity, these two sets do not interfere.\n\n Therefore, the answer is:\n   min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\n But wait: what if we try to use a key on a chest that doesn't meet the condition? Actually, we are separating by the condition: \n   - even chest requires odd key (because even + odd = odd)\n   - odd chest requires even key (because odd + even = odd)\n\n So this is correct.\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\"\n   Chests: [9,14,6,2,11] -> even: [14,6,2] (3), odd: [9,11] (2)\n   Keys: [8,4,7,20] -> even: [8,4,20] (3), odd: [7] (1)\n\n   Then, even_chests (3) can be matched with odd_keys (1) -> min(3,1)=1\n         odd_chests (2) can be matched with even_keys (3) -> min(2,3)=2\n   Total = 1+2 = 3 -> matches the example.\n\n Example 2: \n   Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n   Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> even_chests=5, odd_chests=0\n   Keys: [5] -> odd -> even_keys=0, odd_keys=1\n   Then, even_chests (5) can be matched with odd_keys (1) -> 1\n         odd_chests (0) can be matched with even_keys (0) -> 0\n   Total = 1 -> matches the example.\n\n Example 3: \n   Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n   Chests: [10] -> even_chests=1, odd_chests=0\n   Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> even_keys=4, odd_keys=0\n   Then, even_chests (1) matched with odd_keys (0) -> 0\n         odd_chests (0) matched with even_keys (4) -> 0\n   Total = 0 -> matches the example.\n\n However, wait: in the example, the chest is even and the keys are even. So no key can open the chest because even+even is even (not odd). So it's correct.\n\n But note: the problem says the condition is that the sum must be odd. So even+even = even -> not odd -> invalid. Similarly, odd+odd = even -> invalid.\n\n Therefore, we can simply:\n\n   Step 1: Read n, m\n   Step 2: Read list of chests (n integers)\n   Step 3: Read list of keys (m integers)\n\n   Count:\n     even_chests = count of a_i such that a_i % ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This translates to the condition that an even-numbered chest must be opened by an odd-numbered key, and vice versa.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests and keys based on parity (even or odd). The sum of an even chest number and an odd key number is odd, and similarly, the sum of an odd chest number and an even key number is odd. Thus, we can separate the chests and keys into two groups each: even and odd.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves counting how many chests and keys fall into each parity category. The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of:\n   - The minimum of the number of even chests and odd keys (since even chests require odd keys).\n   - The minimum of the number of odd chests and even keys (since odd chests require even keys).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves straightforward counting and arithmetic operations. We count the number of even and odd values in both the chests and keys lists. Then, we compute the two possible matches as described above and sum them for the result.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves iterating through the lists of chests and keys once each to count the even and odd values, resulting in a linear time complexity O(n + m), where n is the number of chests and m is the number of keys. This is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chests = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chests += 1\n            \n    odd_chests = n - even_chests\n    \n    even_keys = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_keys += 1\n            \n    odd_keys = m - even_keys\n    \n    total = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests (n) and keys (m), followed by the numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Parities**: We count how many chests have even numbers (`even_chests`) and how many have odd numbers (`odd_chests`). Similarly, we count the even and odd numbers among the keys (`even_keys` and `odd_keys`).\n3. **Calculating Matches**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the sum of:\n   - The smaller value between the number of even chests and odd keys (each even chest can be matched with an odd key).\n   - The smaller value between the number of odd chests and even keys (each odd chest can be matched with an even key).\n4. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the total number of chests that can be opened under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the parity condition to maximize the number of chests opened without reusing any key or chest, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
