And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read the first line to get n and k.\n Then, read the next line which has n integers.\n\n There are (n - k + 1) weeks. For each week, we take k consecutive days and compute the average for that week.\n Then we are to output the overall average of these averages? But note: the example input [3,4,7] with k=2 and n=3 gives two weeks: [3,4] and [4,7]. The average for the first week is (3+4)/2 = 3.5, for the second week (4+7)/2 = 5.5. Then the overall average is (3.5+5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5? However, the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n Let me re-read the problem: \"Output average sleeping time over all weeks.\" And the example says: \n   Input: 3 2\\n3 4 7\n   Output: 9.0000000000\n\n But wait, how did they get 9? \n\n Actually, the example states: \"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\n There is no image, but let me think: \n   They have two weeks: \n        Week1: days1 and day2 -> 3+4 = 7 hours in two days -> average per week is (7 * (n-k+1))? \n\n But note: the problem says \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\" but then they consider all weeks together?\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration.\"\n\n Then, the overall average is the total sleep hours in all weeks divided by the number of weeks? Or the average of the averages?\n\n Let me clarify: \n   Each week's sleep time is the sum of k consecutive days, and then we have (n-k+1) such weeks.\n\n But note: the example output is 9.0. How do we get 9.0?\n\n If we consider:\n   Total sleep hours in all weeks: \n        First week: 3+4 = 7\n        Second week: 4+7 = 11\n        Total = 7 + 11 = 18\n   Number of weeks = 2\n   Then average = 18 / 2 = 9.\n\n Alternatively, if we consider the entire set of sleep data, we are effectively counting some days multiple times. In fact, the day2 is counted in two weeks.\n\n So the total sleep hours is the sum of all week sums. And the average per week is that total divided by the number of weeks.\n\n Therefore, we can compute:\n\n   total_weeks = n - k + 1\n   total_sleep = (each week's sum) summed over all weeks.\n\n But note: we cannot iterate over each week because n and k can be up to 200,000, so the number of weeks is about 200,000 which is acceptable? \n   Actually, n-k+1 can be up to 200,000, and if we do a naive loop for each week and then within each week we iterate k elements, that would be O(n*k) which is too slow.\n\n Instead, we can use a sliding window.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Let S = sum(a[0:k]) for the first week.\n   Then, for i from 1 to n-k (inclusive), we subtract a[i-1] and add a[i+k-1] to get the next week's sum.\n\n   Then, we have a list of week sums: [S0, S1, S2, ..., S_{m-1}] where m = n-k+1.\n\n   Then the total sleep is the sum of all S_i, and the average is total_sleep / m.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the average of the averages, but the average over all weeks. That is, we are to compute:\n\n   answer = (sum of all week sums) / (number of weeks)\n\n But wait: the example output is 9.0, and 9.0 is 18/2.\n\n However, note: the example input [3,4,7] with k=2 gives two weeks: [3,4] and [4,7]. The total sleep is 7+11=18, and then divided by 2 weeks -> 9.\n\n But note: the problem says \"average",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a given sequence of days. A week is defined as k consecutive days, and there are (n - k + 1) such weeks in total. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of sleep times for each week and then finding the average of these sums.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires processing a sequence of sleep times for n days, where each week consists of k consecutive days. The goal is to compute the average sleep time across all possible weeks (n - k + 1 weeks). The challenge lies in efficiently calculating the sum of sleep times for each week without resorting to a brute-force method, which would be computationally expensive for large inputs.\n\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**: To optimize the calculation, we use a sliding window approach. This technique allows us to compute the sum of each subsequent week by adjusting the previous week's sum. Specifically, for each new week, we subtract the sleep time of the day that exits the window and add the sleep time of the new day entering the window. This adjustment ensures that we can compute each week's sum in constant time after the initial computation.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: The sliding window approach reduces the time complexity from O(n*k) (brute-force) to O(n), making it suitable for large inputs (up to 200,000 days). The space complexity is O(1) as we only need to maintain the current sum and the total sum of all week sums.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    if k == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n        \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n        \n    current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n    total_sleep = current_sum\n    \n    for i in range(1, total_weeks):\n        current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n        total_sleep += current_sum\n        \n    average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes two integers (n and k) followed by a list of n integers representing daily sleep times.\n2. **Edge Cases Handling**: If k is zero (though constraints ensure k ≥ 1), or if there are no days (n = 0), the output is trivially zero.\n3. **Initial Setup**: The number of weeks is calculated as (n - k + 1). The initial sum of the first k days is computed.\n4. **Sliding Window Processing**: For each subsequent week, the sum is adjusted by subtracting the leftmost day of the previous window and adding the new rightmost day. This adjusted sum is accumulated into a total sleep sum.\n5. **Average Calculation**: The total sleep sum is divided by the number of weeks to get the average. The result is formatted to 10 decimal places to meet the precision requirement.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average by leveraging the sliding window technique, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
