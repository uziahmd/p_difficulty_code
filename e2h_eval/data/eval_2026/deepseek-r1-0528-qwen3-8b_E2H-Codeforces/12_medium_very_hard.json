The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the task locations)\n Since the ringroad is circular and we can only move clockwise, note that moving from house x to house y:\n   If x <= y: then the distance is (y - x) mod n? Actually, because it's circular and clockwise, but note that we can't go counterclockwise.\n   However, note: the problem says the ringroad is one-way clockwise. So from house 1, moving to house 2,3,...,n, then back to 1.\n\n But observe: the houses are numbered 1 to n in clockwise order. The movement is clockwise. Therefore, if we are at house x and want to go to house y:\n   There are two possibilities? Actually no, because we can only move clockwise. But note: the ring is circular. So the direct path from x to y is:\n      If x <= y: then we move (y - x) steps.\n      If x > y: then we move (n - x + y) steps.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time\", and the road is one-way.\n\n But wait: we start at house 1 and have tasks to do in various houses. Also note: we must complete tasks in order (and for each task i, we must have completed all tasks with numbers less than i). This means we might not necessarily go directly from the previous task to the next task without doing other tasks in between.\n\n However, the problem states: initially at house 1, and we have m tasks. The input gives the house numbers for each task (in order).\n\n Important: We must do the tasks in the given order. But note: we may pass by some houses multiple times.\n\n Approach:\n\n We are going to traverse the tasks in order. Let current be the current house we are at (initially 1). For each task location a_i, we need to travel from current to a_i.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to complete the tasks in any order as long as we do them in increasing index? Actually, the problem says: \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" before the i-th. But the i-th task requires being in house a_i. And the tasks are given in a list [a1, a2, ..., am] meaning the first task is at a1, second at a2, etc.\n\n So we must do the tasks in the given order. But note: we can break down the travel:\n\n total_time = 0\n current = 1\n\n for each task_location in the list of m integers:\n     while current != task_location:\n         We move one step clockwise and update current (modular arithmetic? but note: we are in a circle of n houses)\n\n However, m and n up to 10^5, so we cannot do a while loop that runs up to n steps per task (worst-case 10^5 * 10^5 = 10^10 which might be acceptable in C++ but in Python we need an efficient way).\n\n Instead, we can compute the distance from current to task_location in O(1) per task.\n\n How to compute the clockwise distance from current to target?\n\n   If current <= target: \n        distance = target - current\n   Else: (current > target)\n        distance = n - current + target\n\n Then we add this distance to total_time, and set current = target.\n\n However, wait: after completing a task, Xenia is at the target. Then the next task starts from that target.\n\n But let's test with the example: \n   Example 1: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n\n   Start at 1.\n   Task 1: 3 -> distance = 3-1 = 2. Then current=3, total_time=2.\n   Task 2: 2 -> since 3>2, distance = 4-3+2 = 3. Then current=2, total_time=5.\n   Task 3: 3 -> since 2<=3, distance=3-2=1. Then total_time=6.\n\n   Output: 6 -> matches.\n\n   Example 2: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n\n   Start at 1.\n   Task 1: 2 -> distance=2-1=1, current=2, total_time=1.\n   Task 2: 3 -> distance=3-2=1, current=3, total_time=2.\n   Task 3: 3 -> distance=0, total_time=2.\n\n   Output: 2 -> matches.\n\n But wait: what about the fact that we are on a ring? In the above examples, we didn't consider the possibility of multiple laps? \n\n However, note: the problem does not require to minimize the number of laps, but the time. And since moving from a house to the next adjacent house takes 1, and we are forced to move only clockwise, the minimal time to get from current to target is indeed the one we computed (without taking modulus into account for multiple laps because we are only concerned with the immediate next segment).\n\n However, consider: if we have to go from house 1 to house 1, we don't move. But if we have to go from house 1 to house 1 after having done some tasks, that's 0.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1\". So she starts at house 1.\n\n However, there is an alternative: sometimes we might have to do a full circle? The above formula for the case when current > target: n - current + target, which is the same as (target - current + n) % n, but we don't take modulus because we are only concerned with the minimal steps in the clockwise direction.\n\n But note: the above formula is correct for one circle. However, if we were to do more than one circle, we would have to account for that? But observe: the minimal clockwise distance from current to target is always the smallest non-negative integer d such that (current + d) mod n = target, but note the clockwise movement doesn't wrap around negatively. Actually, the minimal clockwise distance is:\n\n   d = (target - current) % n   but wait, that's not correct.\n\n Let me explain:\n\n   If we are at current and want to reach target, the clockwise distance is:\n      If target >= current: d = target - current.\n      If target < current: d = (n - current) + target.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write: d = (target - current) % n, but modulo operation for negative: \n        In Python, (a - b) % n is non-negative, but that formula doesn't give the same.\n\n   Actually, we can compute: d = (target - current) % n, but wait: \n        Example: current=3, target=2, n=4: (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4 = 3. That matches our previous calculation.\n\n   However, note: if we use modulo, then we can also write:\n\n        d = (target - current) % n\n        But wait: if target >= current, then (target - current) % n is just (target - current) because (target - current) is between 0 and n-1, so modulo n doesn't change it.\n\n        If target < current, then (target - current) is negative, and adding n until positive: (target - current + n) % n, but actually modulo operation in Python for negative adds n until positive.\n\n        However, the modulo operation in Python for (target - current) % n gives a result in [0, n-1]. But note: if target == current, then (target - current) % n = 0.\n\n        But is that the minimal clockwise distance? Yes, because we are only allowed to move clockwise and the circle has n houses. The minimal clockwise steps from current to target is (target - current) mod n, but wait: \n\n        Example: current=3, target=3, n=4: (3-3)%4=0 -> correct.\n        Example: current=3, target=2, n=4: (2-3)%4=-1%4=3 -> correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not require to consider the entire circle multiple times. The minimal steps to go from current to target in a circle (with clockwise movement only) is indeed (target - current) % n, but wait: \n\n        But what if we have a very large n and the minimal steps should be (target - current) if positive, else (target - current + n). And (target - current) % n is equivalent to (target - current + n) % n, but note: the modulo operation in Python returns a value in [0, n-1]. \n\n        However, we must be cautious: the problem does not say that we can jump arbitrarily many circles. But the minimal steps is exactly the smallest nonnegative integer d such that (current + d) mod n = target. And that d is (target - current) % n, but wait: \n\n        Actually, the equation is: (current + d) mod n = target, but in modular arithmetic, we have to consider that the circle is of n houses. The minimal d is:\n\n            d = (target - current) % n   if target >= current, then d = target - current, which is correct.\n\n            if target < current, then d = (target - current + n) % n, which is the same as (target - current) % n.\n\n        However, note: if we do (target - current) % n, then in the case target < current, we get a positive number (because modulo n). But is that the minimal steps? Yes.\n\n        But wait: what if we are at house 1 and target is 1, then d=0. What if we are at house 1 and target is 2? then d= (2-1)%4 = 1. Correct.\n\n        However, consider the example: current=1, target=3, n=4: (3-1)%4=2. Correct.\n\n        Now, what if we are at house 4 and target is 1, n=4: (1-4)%4 = (-3)%4 = 1. Because -3 + 4 = 1, and 1 is the minimal steps: from 4 to 1 is 1 step (since 4->1 is one step clockwise). Correct.\n\n        But wait: how do we define the clockwise movement from 4? The houses are 1,2,3,4. From 4, the next clockwise is 1. So indeed 1 step.\n\n        Therefore, we can compute the distance from current to target as (target - current) % n, but wait: is that always the minimal steps?\n\n        Let me check: \n          current=2, target=1, n=4: (1-2)%4 = (-1)%4=3. Steps: 2->3->4->1: 3 steps. Correct.\n\n        So the formula holds.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers: \n          (a - b) % n is equivalent to (a - b + k*n) % n for some k to bring it into [0, n-1]. \n\n        But note: we are only concerned with the minimal positive steps (which is the same as the remainder when (target - current) is divided by n, but adjusted to be positive). \n\n        Therefore, we can compute the distance as (target - current) % n, but wait: what if the distance is 0? Then (target==current) and that is 0, which is correct.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation in Python for (target - current) % n is defined as:\n\n            (a % n) returns the remainder of a divided by n, so it's in [0, n-1].\n\n        But is the minimal clockwise steps from current to target always (target - current) % n?\n\n        Let me think: \n            We are at current, and we want to get to target. We can only move clockwise. We are allowed to go multiple laps, but the minimal steps is the smallest d such that (current + d) mod n = target.\n\n        The equation: (current + d) ≡ target (mod n) and d is minimized (nonnegative). The solution is d = (target - current) mod n, but wait: \n\n        Actually, the minimal d is (target - current) mod n, but note: if (target - current) is negative, we add n until positive. However, the standard way to compute the minimal steps in a circle is:\n\n            d = (target - current) % n\n            if d < 0: d += n   # but wait, the modulus already makes it positive.\n\n        However, in Python, the modulus operator returns a nonnegative result. Therefore, we can simply do:\n\n            d = (target - current) % n\n\n        But wait: what if n=4, current=3, target=5? The target is given in the range [1, n], so target is between 1 and n. So we don't have to worry about target>n.\n\n        Therefore, the code for the distance is:\n\n            d = (target - current) % n\n\n        However, let me verify with the example: current=3, target=2, n=4: \n            (2-3) % 4 = (-1) % 4 = 3 (since -1 + 4 = 3, and 3 < 4, so 3).\n\n        But wait: what if the target is greater than current? \n            Example: current=1, target=3, n=4: (3-1)%4=2, correct.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation is defined such that (a % n) = a - floor(a/n)*n. \n\n        However, there is a catch: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers: \n\n            (-1) % 4 gives 3, which is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if we are at current=4, target=1, n=4: (1-4)%4 = (-3)%4 = 1, which is correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the houses are numbered 1 to n. And the movement is clockwise. So the distance from 4 to 1 is 1.\n\n        But wait: the modulus operation gives 1, which is correct.\n\n        However, there is an alternative: sometimes we might think of the circle as having positions 0 to n-1, but here houses are 1-indexed.\n\n        We can adjust by converting to 0-indexed? \n\n        But note: the problem says the houses are numbered 1 to n. We are using the house numbers directly.\n\n        But the modulus operation is defined for any integer. The formula (target - current) % n works.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation does not consider the circularity in the way we expect? \n\n        Actually, the modulus operation is giving us the minimal steps as if we were in a circle of n houses. \n\n        But wait: what if we are at current and target is the same as current? Then (current - current) % n = 0, which is correct.\n\n        So the plan:\n\n            total_time = 0\n            current = 1\n\n            for each task in the list:\n                # Convert the task to an integer (if needed, but the input is given as integers)\n                d = (task - current) % n\n                # But wait: what if d==0? Then we don't move. But what if we are at current and task is the same, then 0.\n\n                However, note: the modulus operation gives a result in [0, n-1]. But the minimal steps is d, but wait: is d always the minimal steps?\n\n                Consider: we are at current and we want to get to task. We can only move clockwise. The minimal steps is d, but note: d might be 0, then we don't move.\n\n                But wait: the modulus operation gives the minimal steps to reach task from current by moving clockwise (possibly wrapping around). \n\n                However, there is a problem: if n=4, current=1, task=3: d=2. Correct.\n\n                But what if n=4, current=1, task=5? Wait, the input says task is between 1 and n, so task is between 1 and 4. So no.\n\n                Therefore, we can compute the distance as:\n\n                    d = (task - current) % n\n\n                But wait: what if (task - current) is negative and we do modulus, we get a positive number. That positive number is the minimal steps.\n\n                However, note: the modulus operation gives a value in [0, n-1]. The minimal steps in a circle of n houses is indeed in that range.\n\n                But wait: is d the minimal steps? \n\n                Let me consider: we are at current, and we want to get to task. The minimal steps is the smallest d>=0 such that (current + d) mod n = task.\n\n                The solution is: d = (task - current) mod n, but note: if (task - current) is negative, then (task - current) mod n = (task - current + n) mod n, and (task - current + n) is positive and less than n (because task < current, so task - current is negative, and adding n once makes it positive and between (0, n-1)). \n\n                However, note: if (task - current) is negative, then (task - current + n) is positive and less than n (because task>=1, current<=n, so task - current >= 1-n, then adding n: task - current + n >= 1, and <= n-1+n? Actually, if current is 1 and task is 1, then (1-1+n)=n, but wait: we are doing modulus, so:\n\n                Actually, the modulus operation in Python for (task - current) % n is defined as:\n\n                    (a % n) = a - math.floor(a / n) * n\n\n                But for negative a: \n                    (-1) % 4 = 3 because floor(-1/4) is -1, so -1 - (-1)*4 = -1 + 4 = 3.\n\n                So yes, it gives the minimal positive d.\n\n        However, wait: there is a catch. The modulus operation gives the minimal positive d, but note: the minimal steps to reach task from current by moving clockwise is d, but d might be 0, which is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if we are at current and we want to get to task, but the minimal steps is d, but is d the actual minimal steps? \n\n        Example: n=10, current=8, task=9: d=(9-8)%10=1 -> correct.\n        Example: n=10, current=9, task=8: d=(8-9)%10=(-1)%10=9 -> correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the ringroad is one-way and clockwise. So from 9, to get to 8 we must go: 9->0 (but wait, our houses are 1..10, so 9->10->1->2->...->8. How many steps? \n            From 9 to 10: 1 step, then 10 to 1: 1 step, then 1 to 2: 1, 2 to 3:1, 3 to 4:1, 4 to 5:1, 5 to 6:1, 6 to 7:1, 7 to 8:1. Total 9 steps. Correct.\n\n        Therefore, the formula is correct.\n\n        BUT WAIT: there's a problem. The problem says the houses are numbered 1 to n. Our modulus operation is treating the houses as numbers from 1 to n. The movement from house n goes to house 1. \n\n        However, the modulus operation is defined for the entire set of integers. But note: if we use the modulus operation, we are effectively mapping the houses to the integers modulo n, but with the caveat that the houses are labeled 1 to n. \n\n        However, the formula (target - current) % n gives the minimal steps to reach target from current by moving clockwise, considering that after house n comes house 1.\n\n        Therefore, we can use:\n\n            d = (target - current) % n\n\n        But wait: what if the modulus result is 0? Then no movement is needed.\n\n        However, note: if current == target, then (target - current) % n = 0. Correct.\n\n        But wait: what if the modulus result is not the minimal steps? Consider: n=10, current=1, target=11? But target is given in the range [1, n] (so target=11 is not allowed). \n\n        Therefore, we are safe.\n\n        However, there is a twist: the problem does not require to minimize the steps by possibly taking a shortcut that isn't the minimal clockwise steps? But the problem says we must complete the tasks in order and we can only move clockwise. So the minimal steps is indeed the minimal clockwise steps.\n\n        But wait: the example input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" gives 6. Our method:\n\n            current = 1\n            task1 = 3: d = (3-1)%4 = 2 -> total_time=2, current=3.\n            task2 = 2: d = (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4 = 3 -> total_time=5, current=2.\n            task3 = 3: d = (3-2)%4 = 1 -> total_time=6.\n\n        Example2: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n            current=1\n            task1=2: d=(2-1)%4=1 -> total_time=1, current=2.\n            task2=3: d=(3-2)%4=1 -> total_time=2, current=3.\n            task3=3: d= (3-3)%4=0 -> total_time=2.\n\n        It matches.\n\n        However, wait: in the example \"4 3\\n3 2 3\", the sample output is 6. Our calculation gives 6.\n\n        But wait: what if we consider the possibility of moving without wrapping around? The problem does not say we cannot wrap around, and we are forced to move clockwise.\n\n        But note: the problem says the ringroad is circular. So the minimal steps from 3 to 2 is 3 (as we calculated) because we have to go 3->4->1->2.\n\n        However, is there a way to get from 3 to 2 in less than 3 steps? Only by going counterclockwise, but that is not allowed.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is correct.\n\n        BUT: wait, the example in the problem statement says: \n            \"In the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3.\"\n\n        How many steps? \n            Start at 1, then to 2: 1 step, 2->3: 1, 3->4: 1, 4->1: 1, 1->2: 1, 2->3: 1. Total 6.\n\n        Our calculation for the first task: 1->3: 2 steps (1->2->3) and then 3->2: 3 steps (3->4->1->2) and then 2->3: 1 step. Total 2+3+1=6.\n\n        So the modulus method works.\n\n        However, wait: why did the example show 6 steps? Our method breaks the journey from 3 to 2 as 3 steps, but the example shows the entire journey as 6 steps. \n\n        But note: the modulus method is calculating the direct minimal steps from the current to the next task. \n\n        The example's breakdown:\n\n            Step1: 1->2->3: 2 steps (for the first task)\n            Then from 3 to 2: they show 3->4->1->2: 3 steps (for the second task)\n            Then from 2->3: 1 step (for the third task)\n\n            Total 2+3+1=6.\n\n        So it matches.\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            current = 1\n            total_time = 0\n\n            for task in tasks:\n                # Calculate the minimal clockwise steps from current to task\n                d = (task - current) % n\n                # But wait: what if d==0? Then we don't move. However, the modulus operation gives 0 when task==current.\n\n                However, note: the modulus operation might give 0 even if task != current? No, because if task==current, then (task-current)=0, and 0%n=0.\n\n                But wait: what if n=10, current=5, task=5? Then d=0.\n\n                But note: the modulus operation: (5-5)%10=0.\n\n                So we can simply do:\n\n                total_time += d\n                current = task   # because we are now at task\n\n            print(total_time)\n\n        However, wait: what if the modulus operation gives a negative? No, because modulus in Python returns nonnegative.\n\n        But wait: what if n=10, current=5, task=5: d=0, correct.\n\n        However, wait: there is a flaw.\n\n        Consider: the modulus operation gives the minimal steps to reach task from current, but note: the problem does not require to reset current to the task? \n\n        Actually, after we complete the task, we are at the task. So we set current = task.\n\n        But wait: what if the task is the same as the current? Then we don't move, and current remains the same.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if the task is the same as the current? Then we don't move, so the next task starts from the same house.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            current = 1\n            total_time = 0\n            for task in tasks:\n                # Compute the distance from current to task in a circle of n houses (clockwise)\n                # Using the modulus trick\n                d = (task - current) % n\n                # However, wait: the modulus operation gives the minimal steps, but note that the minimal steps in a circle of n houses is (task - current) mod n, but sometimes we can get a negative and then add n until positive. But the modulus operation in Python already does that.\n\n                total_time += d\n                current = task\n\n            print(total_time)\n\n        But wait, let's test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example1: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n\n            n=4, tasks=[3,2,3]\n\n            current=1\n            task=3: d=(3-1)%4=2 -> total_time=2, current=3.\n            task=2: d=(2-3)%4= (-1)%4=3 -> total_time=5, current=2.\n            task=3: d=(3-2)%4=1 -> total_time=6, current=3.\n\n            Output: 6 -> correct.\n\n        Example2: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n\n            current=1\n            task=2: d=(2-1)%4=1 -> total_time=1, current=2.\n            task=3: d=(3-2)%4=1 -> total_time=2, current=3.\n            task=3: d=0 -> total_time=2.\n\n            Output: 2 -> correct.\n\n        But wait: what if we have a task that is the same as the current, then we add 0 and set current to the same value. Correct.\n\n        However, consider a different example: \n\n            Input: \"5 3\\n1 5 1\"\n\n            Houses: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\n            Start at 1.\n            First task: 1 -> d=0, then current=1, total_time=0.\n            Second task:5 -> d=(5-1)%5=4 -> total_time=4, current=5.\n            Third task:1 -> d=(1-5)%5 = (-4)%5=1 -> because -4+5=1. So total_time=5.\n\n            But let's simulate:\n\n                Start at 1 (task1 done, no move).\n                Then from 1 to 5: \n                    1->2:1, 2->3:2, 3->4:3, 4->5:4. So 4 steps.\n                Then from 5 to 1: \n                    5->1:1 step (because clockwise: 5->1 is one step).\n\n                Total 4+1=5.\n\n            The code gives 5.\n\n        However, wait: the modulus operation for (1-5)%5: \n            (1-5) = -4, then -4 %5: \n                -4 // 5 is -1 (floor division) because -4 = 5*(-1) + 1, so remainder is 1.\n\n            So d=1, which is correct.\n\n        But wait, what if we have:\n\n            \"5 3\\n1 1 1\"\n\n            n=5, tasks=[1,1,1]\n\n            current=1\n            task1: d=(1-1)%5=0 -> total_time=0, current=1.\n            task2: d=0 -> total_time=0, current=1.\n            task3: d=0 -> total_time=0.\n\n            Output:0. Correct.\n\n        However, wait: what if the task list has duplicates and consecutive same tasks? It works.\n\n        But wait: what if we have to go from 5 to 1? We computed 1 step. Correct.\n\n        One more example: \n\n            \"3 3\\n1 3 2\"\n\n            Start at 1.\n            task1:1 -> d=0, current=1, total=0.\n            task2:3 -> d=(3-1)%3=2, total=2, current=3.\n            task3:2 -> d=(2-3)%3=(-1)%3=2 (because -1+3=2). Then total=4.\n\n            Simulation: \n                Start at 1.\n                Task1: stay at 1.\n                Task2: 1->2->3: 2 steps.\n                Task3: from 3 to 2: clockwise: 3->1->2: 2 steps.\n\n            Total 4.\n\n        But wait, is there a shorter way for task3? \n            From 3 to 2: \n                Option1: 3->1->2 (2 steps)\n                Option2: 3-> ? but we can only go clockwise, so 3->1 is the only option and then 1->2.\n\n            So 2 steps is minimal.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        However, wait: there is a potential pitfall. The modulus operation gives the minimal steps, but note: the minimal steps is the same as the minimal clockwise steps. \n\n        But wait: what if n=10, current=10, task=1: \n            d = (1-10)%10 = (-9)%10 = 1 -> because -9+10=1. \n            Steps: 10->1: 1 step. Correct.\n\n        Another: current=10, task=9: \n            d = (9-10)%10 = (-1)%10=9 -> 9 steps: 10->1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9? Actually, from 10 to 9: \n                10->1 (step1), 1->2 (step2), 2->3 (step3), 3->4 (step4), 4->5 (step5), 5->6 (step6), 6->7 (step7), 7->8 (step8), 8->9 (step9). 9 steps. Correct.\n\n        But wait: the example with n=10, current=10, task=1: \n            Steps: 10->1: that's 1 step.\n\n        Therefore, the modulus operation is giving the correct minimal steps.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation in the way we defined does not account for the fact that the houses are arranged in a circle, but the modulus operation is standard for circular distances.\n\n        But wait: the problem says the ringroad is one-way and clockwise. The modulus operation is giving the minimal clockwise steps.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            current = 1\n            ans = 0\n            for a in arr:\n                # Calculate the distance from current to a\n                # We are using the modulus operation to get the minimal clockwise steps.\n                d = (a - current) % n\n                # But wait: what if d==0? Then we don't move, which is correct.\n\n                # However, note: the modulus operation might give 0 even if a != current? \n                # Actually, if a != current, then (a - current) % n is 0 only if a == current (because n is the modulus and a and current are between 1 and n). \n\n                # But wait: if n=4, current=1, a=5: then (5-1)%4=4%4=0, but 5 is not in the valid range [1,4]. So we are safe.\n\n                ans += d\n                current = a\n\n            print(ans)\n\n        However, wait: there is a problem with the modulus operation. \n\n        Consider: n=10, current=5, a=5: d=0 -> correct.\n        n=10, current=5, a=15: but a is guaranteed to be between 1 and n, so 15 is not allowed.\n\n        But wait: what if the task is 1 and current is 10, then d=(1-10)%10= -9 %10=1. Correct.\n\n        But wait: what if the task is 10 and current is 1, then d=(10-1)%10=9%10=9. Correct.\n\n        However, wait: what if the task is 10 and current is 10? Then d=0. Correct.\n\n        But wait: what if the task is 10 and current is 9? Then d=(10-9)%10=1. Correct.\n\n        Everything seems to work.\n\n        However, wait: what if the task is 1 and current is 2? Then d=(1-2)%10= -1%10=9. Correct.\n\n        But wait: the example \"3 3\\n1 3 2\" we did above: n=3, current=3, task=2: d=(2-3)%3=(-1)%3=2. Correct.\n\n        BUT WAIT: there is an issue: the modulus operation gives the minimal steps, but note that the minimal steps might be achieved by going a full circle? \n\n        Actually, the modulus operation gives the minimal steps in the range [0, n-1]. And the minimal steps in a circle of n houses is at most n-1.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not require to minimize the steps by doing multiple laps, but the minimal steps is always the minimal clockwise steps (which is at most n-1). \n\n        But wait: consider if we have to go from house 1 to house 1: minimal steps 0, which is correct.\n\n        Therefore, we can use the modulus operation.\n\n        However, wait: I just thought: the modulus operation is defined for the entire set of integers, but our houses are 1-indexed. The modulus operation is independent of indexing? \n\n        Actually, the modulus operation does not depend on indexing. We are treating the houses as integers and using the difference.\n\n        But wait: the modulus operation does not account for the circularity of the labels. The labels are 1 to n, but the modulus operation is defined for the entire integer set. \n\n        However, the minimal steps in a circle of n houses from current to target is (target - current) mod n, but note: if we map the houses to 0-indexed, then the minimal steps would be (target-1 - (current-1)) % n, and then that is the same as (target - current) % n? \n\n        Let me check:\n\n            Map: house i -> i-1 (0-indexed)\n\n            Then the minimal steps from current (i) to target (j) in a circle of n houses (0-indexed) is (j - i) % n.\n\n            Then in 0-indexed, the distance is (j-i) % n.\n\n            Then if we map back: \n                current_house = i+1, target_house = j+1.\n\n            Then (j-i) % n = ((target_house-1) - (current_house-1)) % n = (target_house - current_house) % n.\n\n           ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad in a clockwise direction. The key observation here is that the movement is restricted to clockwise only, and each move between adjacent houses takes one unit of time. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order. Each task requires her to be at a specific house. The challenge is to calculate the minimal time required to move from her current house to the next task's house, considering the circular nature of the ringroad.\n2. **Insight**: The minimal steps to move from house `current` to house `task` in a clockwise direction on a ring of `n` houses can be computed using modulo arithmetic. Specifically, the distance `d` is calculated as `(task - current) % n`. This formula accounts for both scenarios where the task house is ahead or behind the current house in the clockwise direction.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each task, compute the distance from the current position to the task's house using the modulo operation. Sum these distances to get the total time required. Update the current position to the task's house after each move.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each task exactly once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(m), where m is the number of tasks. This is optimal given the constraints (m ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    \n    for task in tasks:\n        d = (task - current) % n\n        total_time += d\n        current = task\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of tasks), followed by a list of `m` integers representing the task locations.\n2. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 (`current = 1`) with total time initialized to 0.\n3. **Processing Tasks**: For each task location:\n   - **Distance Calculation**: Compute the minimal clockwise steps from the current house to the task house using `(task - current) % n`. This handles both cases where the task is ahead or behind the current house, wrapping around the circular road if necessary.\n   - **Update Time and Position**: Add the computed distance to the total time and update the current position to the task's house.\n4. **Output**: After processing all tasks, print the total time taken.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal time by leveraging modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
