There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given n, h, m and then m lines of restrictions [l_i, r_i, x_i]\n Since n, m, h are at most 50, we can use dynamic programming or even try to use a state space that considers the restrictions.\n\n However, note: the restrictions are given as intervals. We have to satisfy all the restrictions.\n\n Idea:\n We can think of each house i (from 1 to n) having a height between 0 and h, but subject to the restrictions that cover that house.\n\n But note: the restrictions say that in an interval [l, r] the maximum must be <= x. So for a house i, we must set its height to at most the minimum x from all restrictions that cover house i.\n\n However, wait: is that correct? Actually, no. Because one restriction might require that the entire interval [l, r] has max <= x, but if we set each house independently by the minimum x that covers it, then we might break a restriction that requires a higher x elsewhere? \n\n Alternatively, we can consider constraints that must hold: For each restriction i, the maximum height in [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i.\n\n How to enforce? We can use the fact that the restrictions are independent. Since n, m are small (<=50), we can do:\n\n Let's define an array `max_allowed` for each position i (from 0 to n-1) as the minimum x from all restrictions that cover i. Then the house i cannot exceed `max_allowed[i]`.\n\n But wait: is that sufficient? Consider two restrictions:\n   Restriction 1: [1,3] with x=2\n   Restriction 2: [2,4] with x=3\n\n For house 2: \n   From restriction 1: allowed 2\n   From restriction 2: allowed 3 -> so min is 2.\n\n However, if we set house 2 to 2, then the restriction [2,4] says the tallest in [2,4] must be <=3, which is satisfied. But what about house 3?\n   House 3: from restriction1: 2, from restriction2: 3 -> min is 2.\n\n Now, what if we set house 1 to 2 (from restriction1) and house 4 to 3 (from restriction2). Then the restriction1 [1,3] has max = max(2,2,2)=2 -> ok; restriction2 [2,4] has max = max(2,2,2,3)=3 -> ok.\n\n But is the converse true? If we set each house to the minimum of the x's from the restrictions that cover it, then all restrictions are satisfied? \n\n Yes, because for any restriction j covering [l_j, r_j], the height at any house in that interval is at most x_j (since the min over the restrictions including j is <= x_j). Therefore, the maximum in the interval is <= x_j.\n\n However, there is a catch: we are allowed to set the house lower than the min x. But we want to maximize profit. The profit is the sum of squares. Since the square function is increasing (for nonnegative integers) and convex, we would want to set each house as high as possible. Therefore, for each house i, the best we can do is set it to the minimum x among all restrictions that cover i, unless we can set it higher without violating any restriction? \n\n But wait, if we set a house to a value higher than the minimum x of the restrictions covering it, then at least one restriction (the one that requires x=min_value) would be violated. So the maximum allowed for house i is min_{for all restrictions j that cover i} x_j.\n\n However, let's test with the example: \n Example 1: \n   Input: n=3, h=3, m=3, restrictions: [1,1,1], [2,2,3], [3,3,2]\n\n   Then for house1: covered by restriction1 -> min x is 1.\n   House2: covered by restriction2 -> min x is 3.\n   House3: covered by restriction3 -> min x is 2.\n\n   Then the heights would be [1,3,2] -> profit 1+9+4=14.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: n=4, h=10, m=2, restrictions: [2,3,8], [3,4,7]\n\n   Then for house1: no restriction? But note the problem: \"In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between 0 and h.\" and the restrictions only apply to the specified intervals. For house1, since no restriction covers it, we can set it to h (which is 10). However, wait: the second example input doesn't specify any restriction for house1? \n\n   But note: the input says the restrictions are [2,3,8] and [3,4,7]. So house1 is not covered by any restriction. Then the maximum allowed for house1 is h (10). Similarly, house2: covered by first restriction (x=8) -> 8; house3: covered by both restrictions -> min(8,7)=7; house4: covered by second restriction -> 7.\n\n   Then the heights: [10,8,7,7] -> profit 10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 100+64+49+49 = 262.\n\n So the plan:\n   Step 1: Precompute for each house i (from 0 to n-1) the minimum x from all restrictions that cover house i+1.\n\n   How to compute? We can initialize an array `min_x` of length n (for houses 1..n) with a large number (or h+1, since x_i <= h) and then for each restriction (l, r, x):\n        For each house j from l-1 to r-1 (0-indexed), set min_x[j] = min(min_x[j], x)\n\n   Then, for each house i, the maximum allowed height is min(min_x[i], h) ? \n\n   But note: the problem says the house can be built with height between 0 and h. And our computed min_x[i] might be <= h (since x_i<=h). So we don't need the min with h because x_i is at most h.\n\n   However, what if we have no restriction for house i? Then we started with a large number and then didn't update. Then we should set it to h.\n\n   We can initialize `min_x` with a value greater than h (like h+1) and then after processing all restrictions, if min_x[i] is still h+1, then set it to h.\n\n   Then, for each house i, the maximum height we can assign is min_x[i] (which is at most h).\n\n   Step 2: Now we have for each house i, a maximum height a_i = min_x[i]. Then the problem becomes: assign to each house i a height a_i' in [0, a_i] such that the profit (sum of squares) is maximized.\n\n   Since the square function is increasing and strictly convex, the optimal assignment for house i is to set it to its maximum allowed value a_i. Why? Because if we set it lower, we get less square and we don't gain anything by setting a house lower than the maximum allowed. \n\n   However, wait: is that always optimal? Consider: could there be a trade-off? For example, if two adjacent houses are constrained by overlapping restrictions and one house's height affects the constraint of the next? But note: our constraints are independent per house in terms of the maximum allowed. Each house i is only required to be <= the minimum x from the restrictions that cover it. There is no constraint that says the house must be as high as possible for the entire system? \n\n   Let me clarify: the restrictions are independent. The only constraints are the intervals. And we have broken down the constraint for each house to the minimum x that applies to it. Then, the entire set of constraints is satisfied if and only if each house i is <= min_x[i]. And we are free to choose any value from 0 to min_x[i] for house i.\n\n   Therefore, we set house i to min_x[i] (if min_x[i] >=0) and then the profit is the sum of (min_x[i])^2 for i from 0 to n-1.\n\n   But wait, in Example 1: \n        min_x[0]=1, min_x[1]=3, min_x[2]=2 -> profit = 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1+9+4=14.\n\n   Example 2: \n        min_x[0]=10, min_x[1]=8, min_x[2]=7, min_x[3]=7 -> profit = 100+64+49+49=262.\n\n   However, wait! There is a catch: the restrictions are defined on intervals. Our method sets each house to the minimum x of the restrictions that cover it. But is that the maximum allowed? Yes. \n\n   But consider: what if two restrictions overlap and one restricts a house to a low value, but if we set that house to a higher value (but not above the minimum) then we might break nothing? Actually, we set it to the maximum allowed, which is the minimum x. \n\n   However, wait: is it possible that by setting a house to a value lower than the maximum allowed, we can allow some other house to be set higher? \n\n   Let me think: the constraints are independent. Each restriction only constrains the entire interval. There is no constraint that says \"if I set house i to a high value, then house j must be low\". \n\n   Therefore, the constraints are separable: the condition for a restriction [l, r] is that the maximum in that interval is <= x. We can set each house independently to the minimum x that covers it, and that will satisfy all restrictions. \n\n   But wait, what if we set a house to a value lower than the minimum x that covers it? Then we are still satisfying the restrictions, but we are getting less profit. Since we want to maximize profit, we would set each house to the maximum allowed (i.e., the minimum x from the restrictions covering it). \n\n   However, note: the maximum allowed is the minimum x from the restrictions covering it. We cannot set a house to more than that because one of the restrictions would be violated.\n\n   Therefore, the solution is:\n\n      Initialize an array `max_height` (or `min_x`) of length n with a value larger than h (say h+1).\n      For each restriction (each line after the first):\n          l, r, x = map(int, line.split())\n          For j from l-1 to r-1 (0-indexed indices):\n              if x < max_height[j]:\n                  max_height[j] = x\n\n      Then, for each j, if max_height[j] == h+1, then set it to h (because no restriction applies, so the house can be up to h).\n\n      Then, for each j, set the height to max_height[j] (the maximum allowed) and compute the profit as the sum of squares.\n\n   However, wait: is it really that simple?\n\n   Let's test with the example: \n        Example 1: \n            Initially: [4,4,4] (if h=3, then we use 4 as the initial)\n            After first restriction [1,1,1]: update index0 to 1 -> [1,4,4]\n            Second: [2,2,3]: update index1 to 3 -> [1,3,4]\n            Third: [3,3,2]: update index2 to 2 -> [1,3,2]\n\n            Then set any that are 4 (initial) to 3? Actually, we set to h=3 only if they are still 4? But note, we have an if: if no restriction, set to h.\n\n            In this case, we set each house to the computed value, which is not h (because we updated). \n\n            Then profit = 1^2+3^2+2^2 = 14.\n\n        Example 2:\n            h=10, so we initialize with 11 (since h+1=11).\n            First restriction: [2,3,8] -> update indices 1 and 2 to 8 -> [11,8,8,11]\n            Second restriction: [3,4,7] -> update indices 2 and 3 to 7 -> [11,8,7,7]\n            Then set houses 0 and 3 to h=10? \n                Actually, we only set if the value is still 11 (the initial). So house0: 11 -> set to 10; house3: 7 (already updated) remains 7.\n\n            Then heights: [10,8,7,7] -> profit=100+64+49+49=262.\n\n   But wait, what if a house is covered by multiple restrictions and the minimum x is 10 (which is the same as h)? Then we set it to 10. That's okay.\n\n   However, there is a potential issue: what if a restriction has x_i greater than h? According to the problem, x_i is between 0 and h, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   But wait: what if two restrictions overlap and one gives x=5 and another gives x=10? Then the house is set to 5. But note, the house cannot exceed h anyway, and 5<=h. So that's fine.\n\n   However, consider a different example: \n        n=1, h=5, m=2, restrictions: [1,1,3] and [1,1,4]\n        Then we set house0 to 3 (min(3,4)).\n        Profit=9.\n\n   Another example: \n        n=2, h=5, m=2, restrictions: [1,2,3] and [1,2,4]\n        Then for both houses: min(3,4)=3. Then we set both to 3. Profit=3^2+3^2=18.\n\n   But is that correct? The restriction [1,2,3] requires the maximum in [1,2] <=3, so we must set both to <=3. The restriction [1,2,4] requires the same. So the maximum allowed for each house is 3. Then 3 is the maximum we can set. \n\n   However, what if we set one house to 3 and the other to 3? That satisfies both restrictions.\n\n   Now, what if we set one house to 3 and the other to 2? Then the maximum is 3, so both restrictions are satisfied. But that gives less profit (3^2+2^2=9+4=13) than 18.\n\n   Therefore, the above reasoning holds: we set each house to the minimum x (clamped by h) that covers it.\n\n   However, wait: what if the restrictions are not independent? Consider:\n\n        Example 3: \n          n=2, h=5, m=2\n          Restriction1: [1,2,3]\n          Restriction2: [1,1,4] and [2,2,2]   -> wait, two restrictions: [1,1,4] and [2,2,2]\n\n        Then for house0: min(4) = 4 -> but wait, the overall constraint from restriction1 says the entire interval [1,2] must be <=3, so we cannot set house0 to 4. \n\n   This reveals a flaw: our method of taking the minimum x from all restrictions that cover a house does not account for the fact that the entire interval must satisfy the restriction. \n\n   In Example 3, we have two restrictions: \n        Restriction1: [1,2] must have max<=3.\n        Restriction2: [1,1] must have max<=4 -> this is automatically satisfied if the first restriction holds (because 4>=3, but actually the house0 must be <=3 from the first restriction, so the second restriction doesn't harm) and [2,2] must have max<=2.\n\n   Then the maximum allowed for house0 is min(4, 3) = 3 (because of the first restriction) and for house1 is min(2,3)=2.\n\n   But wait, the first restriction requires the entire interval [1,2] to be <=3. The second restriction for house0 says <=4, which is worse (less restrictive) than 3, so house0 is limited by the first restriction. House1 is limited by the second restriction (which is 2) and the first restriction (3) -> so 2.\n\n   So the method still holds: for each house, we take the minimum x from all restrictions that cover it.\n\n   However, note: the first restriction covers both houses, and we must ensure the entire interval [1,2] has max<=3. Our method sets house0 to 3 and house1 to 2, so the entire interval has max=3, which is <=3. So it satisfies the first restriction.\n\n   But what if we had:\n\n        Example 4:\n          n=2, h=5, m=2\n          Restriction1: [1,2,3]\n          Restriction2: [1,1,2] and [2,2,4]\n\n        Then for house0: min(2,3)=2; house1: min(3,4)=3.\n\n        Then the entire interval [1,2] has max = max(2,3)=3, which is <=3 (restriction1) and also house0<=2 (restriction2) and house1<=4 (restriction2) -> satisfied.\n\n   But now consider:\n\n        Example 5: \n          n=2, h=5, m=2\n          Restriction1: [1,2,3]\n          Restriction2: [1,1,1] and [2,2,5]\n\n        Then house0: min(1,3)=1; house1: min(3,5)=3.\n\n        Entire interval [1,2] has max=3, which is <=3 (restriction1) and house0<=1 (restriction2) and house1<=5 (restriction2) -> satisfied.\n\n   But wait, what if we set house0 to 1 and house1 to 3, then the entire interval [1,2] has max=3, which is okay. But what if we set house0 to 1 and house1 to 2? Then the entire interval [1,2] has max=2, which is also <=3. But we are maximizing profit, so we set house1 to 3 (the maximum allowed) and house0 to 1.\n\n   So the method seems to hold.\n\n   However, let me think of a more subtle example:\n\n        Example 6:\n          n=3, h=10, m=2\n          Restriction1: [1,3,5]   -> entire [1,3] must be <=5.\n          Restriction2: [1,1,10] and [2,2,10] and [3,3,10]   -> these are no restrictions (since 10 is the global maximum) so they don't matter.\n\n        Then we set each house to 5. Profit=3*(5^2)=75.\n\n        Now, what if we set one house to 5, another to 5, and the third to 5? Then the entire interval [1,3] has max=5, which is <=5. So it's okay.\n\n        Now, what if we set one house to 6? Then the entire interval [1,3] would have a house=6, which violates restriction1.\n\n   Therefore, the method of setting each house to the minimum x from the covering restrictions is correct.\n\n   But wait, what if there is a restriction that is not the tightest one? \n\n        Example 7:\n          n=2, h=10, m=3\n          Restriction1: [1,2,5]\n          Restriction2: [1,1,10]\n          Restriction3: [2,2,10]\n\n        Then house0: min(5,10)=5; house1: min(5,10)=5.\n\n        Entire interval [1,2] has max=5, which is <=5 (restriction1). Also, house0<=10 (restriction2) and house1<=10 (restriction3). So it's okay.\n\n   So the algorithm:\n\n        Read n, h, m.\n        Initialize an array `arr` of length n with a big number (say, h+1) for each house.\n\n        For i in range(m):\n            Read l, r, x.\n            For j from l-1 to r-1 (0-indexed):\n                if x < arr[j]:\n                    arr[j] = x\n\n        Then, for each j in range(n):\n            if arr[j] == h+1:\n                arr[j] = h   # because no restriction applies, so we can use the global maximum h.\n\n        Then, profit = sum( a*a for a in arr )\n\n        Print profit.\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        n=3, h=3, m=3\n        Restrictions: [1,1,1], [2,2,3], [3,3,2]\n\n        arr initially: [4,4,4] (h+1=4)\n        Process [1,1,1]: j=0 -> arr[0]=min(4,1)=1 -> [1,4,4]\n        Process [2,2,3]: j=1 -> arr[1]=min(4,3)=3 -> [1,3,4]\n        Process [3,3,2]: j=2 -> arr[2]=min(4,2)=2 -> [1,3,2]\n        Then, set any remaining >3? None, because 1,3,2 are <=3.\n        Profit = 1+9+4 = 14.\n\n   Example 2:\n        n=4, h=10, m=2\n        Restrictions: [2,3,8] and [3,4,7]\n\n        arr initially: [11,11,11,11]\n        Process [2,3,8]: j=1,2 -> arr[1]=8, arr[2]=8 -> [11,8,8,11]\n        Process [3,4,7]: j=2,3 -> arr[2]=min(8,7)=7, arr[3]=7 -> [11,8,7,7]\n        Then set: \n            j0: 11 -> set to 10\n            j1: 8 -> remains 8\n            j2: 7 -> remains 7\n            j3: 7 -> remains 7\n        Profit = 100+64+49+49=262.\n\n   However, wait: what if we have a restriction that is repeated and the minimum x is updated multiple times? The above loop naturally updates to the minimum.\n\n   But consider: what if a restriction has a very high x? Then we update only when we see a lower x. But if we have two restrictions covering the same house: one with x=5 and one with x=10, then the house will be set to 5.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, wait: what if we have two restrictions that are conflicting in the sense that one requires a lower maximum than the other, but they are not the same house? \n\n   Example 8: \n        n=2, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,1,5] and [2,2,10]   -> house0:5, house1:10\n        Restriction2: [1,2,6]                 -> then house0: min(5,6)=5, house1: min(10,6)=6.\n\n        Then the entire interval [1,2] must be <=6 (from restriction2). Now, we set house0=5 and house1=6 -> max=6, which satisfies restriction2.\n\n        But note: without restriction2, we would have set house1 to 10. But with restriction2, we set house1 to 6.\n\n        However, our method correctly updates: we process the two restrictions separately. The order does not matter because we are taking the minimum.\n\n        But wait, we process the first restriction (Restriction1) and then the second (Restriction2). \n\n        After Restriction1: [5,10]\n        Then Restriction2: update house0: min(5,6)=5 -> no change; house1: min(10,6)=6.\n\n        So the result is [5,6].\n\n        Now, what if the restrictions are given in reverse order?\n\n        Example 8 reversed:\n          n=2, h=10, m=2\n          Restriction1: [1,2,6]\n          Restriction2: [1,1,5] and [2,2,10]\n\n        Then:\n          Initially: [11,11]\n          Process Restriction1: [1,2,6] -> [6,6]\n          Process Restriction2: \n               [1,1,5]: update index0: min(6,5)=5 -> [5,6]\n               [2,2,10]: update index1: min(6,10)=6 -> [5,6]\n\n        Same result.\n\n   Therefore, the algorithm is robust to the order.\n\n   But wait: what if a restriction is applied to an interval that partially overlaps with others, and we update a house multiple times? \n\n        Example 9:\n          n=3, h=10, m=3\n          Restriction1: [1,3,5]\n          Restriction2: [1,2,4]\n          Restriction3: [2,3,3]\n\n        Then for house0 (index0): \n            Restriction1: 5, Restriction2:4 -> min=4\n        For house1 (index1):\n            Restriction1:5, Restriction2:4, Restriction3:3 -> min=3\n        For house2 (index2):\n            Restriction1:5, Restriction3:3 -> min=3\n\n        Then the entire interval [1,3] must be <=5 (restriction1) and the entire interval [1,2] must be <=4 (restriction2) and [2,3] must be <=3 (restriction3). \n\n        Then house0=4, house1=3, house2=3. \n        Check restriction1: [1,3] -> max=4, which is <=5 -> ok.\n        restriction2: [1,2] -> max=4, which is <=4 -> ok.\n        restriction3: [2,3] -> max=3, which is <=3 -> ok.\n\n        Profit = 4^2+3^2+3^2=16+9+9=34.\n\n        Without the above method, we would have to check the entire interval conditions. But note: the condition for restriction2: [1,2] must be <=4, so house0 and house1 must be <=4. Then house0 is set to 4 (which is the minimum between 5 and 4) and house1 to 3 (minimum between 5,4,3). \n\n   Therefore, the method works.\n\n   However, wait: is it possible that a house is constrained by two restrictions that are not the same, and the minimum x from the restrictions is the correct maximum for the entire system?\n\n   Yes, because the house must be <= every x from the restrictions that cover it, so the minimum is the tightest constraint.\n\n   Therefore, we can code accordingly.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"the tallest house from spots l_i to r_i must be at most x_i\". Our method sets each house to the minimum x from the restrictions that cover it, and then the tallest house in any interval [l_i, r_i] is the maximum value of the min_x in that interval. \n\n   However, note: the min_x for each house is the minimum x from the restrictions that cover it. Then, the maximum value in the interval [l_i, r_i] is the maximum of the min_x values for houses in that interval. \n\n   But is that <= x_i? \n\n   Consider: for a given restriction j with [l_j, r_j] and x_j, then for every house i in [l_j, r_j], we have min_x[i] <= x_j. Then the maximum value in [l_j, r_j] is the maximum of min_x[i] for i in [l_j, r_j] and that maximum is <= x_j (because each min_x[i] is <= x_j). \n\n   Therefore, the condition is satisfied.\n\n   However, note: the condition is that the tallest house in [l_j, r_j] is <= x_j. Our assignment ensures that each house in [l_j, r_j] is <= x_j, so the tallest is <= x_j.\n\n   But wait: what if the house is set to a value that is the minimum x from multiple restrictions, and one of those restrictions is not the one that defines the interval? \n\n   Example 10:\n        n=2, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,2,5] (so house0 and house1 must be <=5)\n        Restriction2: [1,1,3] (so house0 must be <=3)\n\n        Then min_x[0]=min(5,3)=3, min_x[1]=5.\n\n        Now, the entire interval [1,2] (restriction1) has max=5, which is <=5 -> ok.\n\n        But note: the house0 is set to 3, which is <=3 (restriction2) and the entire interval [1,2] has max=5 (from house1) and house0=3, so the max is 5, which is <=5.\n\n   So it's correct.\n\n   Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, wait: what if the same house is covered by two restrictions with different x's, and we take the minimum, but then the entire interval condition is still satisfied? We already proved that.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n        # Initialize an array for the n houses with a value bigger than h (since x_i <= h)\n        arr = [h+1] * n\n\n        # Read the m restrictions\n        for _ in range(m):\n            data = input().split()\n            if not data:\n                continue\n            l = int(data[0])\n            r = int(data[1])\n            x_val = int(data[2])\n            # Update the houses from l-1 to r-1\n            for j in range(l-1, r):\n                if x_val < arr[j]:\n                    arr[j] = x_val\n\n        # Now, adjust houses that were never updated (still h+1) to h\n        for j in range(n):\n            if arr[j] == h+1:\n                arr[j] = h\n\n        # Calculate the profit\n        profit = 0\n        for a in arr:\n            profit += a*a\n\n        print(profit)\n\n   But wait, is that correct for the entire set of restrictions? \n\n   However, consider a scenario where a house is covered by a restriction with x=0. Then the house must be 0. Then the entire interval condition must be satisfied. \n\n   Example: \n        n=1, h=10, m=1\n        Restriction: [1,1,0]\n\n        Then we set the house to 0. Profit=0.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if two restrictions: one allows 0 and one allows 5, then the house must be 0. Correct.\n\n   Another edge: no restrictions (m=0). Then we set every house to h, and profit = n * (h*h)\n\n   Example: \n        n=3, h=3, m=0 -> [3,3,3] -> profit=3*9=27.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between 0 and h.\" and without restrictions, we set to h.\n\n   But wait: is there any restriction that the house must be at most h? Yes, the problem states that. And we are clamping to h for houses that are not updated by any restriction.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says the maximum height is h, so we cannot exceed h. Our method for houses not updated by any restriction sets them to h, which is the maximum allowed.\n\n   Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n   But wait: the example input format is given as a list of strings, but the problem says we read from stdin.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \n            Input: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n\n            Output: 14\n\n        Example 2:\n            Input: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n            Output: 262\n\n   We'll run the code with these inputs.\n\n   However, note: the example input is given as a list of strings in the problem statement, but we are reading from stdin.\n\n   Let me test with the provided example 1:\n\n        $ echo \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\" | python3 my_program.py\n        Expected: 14\n\n   It should output 14.\n\n   But wait, there is a problem: the example input has three restrictions, but our code reads m=3 and then three lines. \n\n   However, the example input is provided as:\n\n        ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n   But in the actual input, we have two separate test cases? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \n        The first line contains three integers n, h, m (1 ≤ n,h,m ≤ 50) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.\n        Each of the next m lines contains three integers l_i, r_i, and x_i.\n\n   And the example input is two separate test cases? \n\n   Looking at the example: \n        Input: \n            ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n        Output: \n            ['14', '262']\n\n   But wait, the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", and then the input. It seems the example input is given as two separate test cases, but the problem description does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n   Actually, the problem says: \n        The first line contains three integers n, h, m ... and then m lines.\n\n   So there is one test case per execution.\n\n   However, the example input is given as two strings, which suggests that the example input might have been two test cases. But the problem does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n   Let me read the problem statement again: \n        \"You are planning to build housing on a street.\"\n\n   It implies one street.\n\n   But the example input is two separate examples.\n\n   The problem says: \n        Input: \n            The first line contains three integers n, h, m ...\n\n   And then m lines.\n\n   So the example input format is one test case. The example provided two test cases for illustration.\n\n   However, the problem says \"Print a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\"\n\n   Therefore, we assume one test case.\n\n   But the example input is given as two strings, so we must read from stdin until EOF? \n\n   Actually, the example input is provided as:\n\n        ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n   This is two test cases. But the problem does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n   However, looking at the constraints: n, h, m up to 50, and m up to 50, so we can read until EOF.\n\n   But the problem statement does not mention multiple test cases.\n\n   Since the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", and the example input is two test cases, but the problem statement does not specify, we must ask: is the input multiple test cases?\n\n   Let me check the example output: two integers.\n\n   But the problem says: \"Print a single integer\".\n\n   This implies that the program reads one test case and outputs one integer.\n\n   The example input is two test cases, but the problem statement example is just showing two examples.\n\n   How did they provide the example input? As two separate lines? \n\n   Actually, the example input is:\n\n        Input: \n            3 3 3\n            1 1 1\n            2 2 3\n            3 3",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to given zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses built on each spot. The key challenge is to ensure that all zoning restrictions are satisfied, which impose constraints on the maximum height of houses within certain intervals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining the optimal height for each house such that all zoning restrictions are met. Each restriction specifies that the tallest house in a particular interval must not exceed a certain height. The goal is to maximize the sum of the squares of the house heights, given these constraints.\n2. **Intuition**: For each house, the maximum allowable height is determined by the most restrictive zoning restriction that covers it. This is because any house must comply with all restrictions that include it, and the tightest restriction (smallest maximum height) will dictate its maximum allowable height.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Initialization**: Start by assuming each house can be built up to the global maximum height `h`.\n   - **Processing Restrictions**: For each zoning restriction, update the maximum allowable height for each house in the specified interval to the minimum of its current value and the restriction's maximum height. This ensures that all overlapping restrictions are accounted for.\n   - **Final Adjustment**: After processing all restrictions, any house still at the initial value (indicating no restrictions applied) is set to the global maximum height `h`.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each restriction and updates the relevant houses in linear time relative to the interval length. Given that the number of restrictions `m` and the number of houses `n` are both up to 50, the total operations are manageable (O(m*n)), making the solution efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    n = int(first_line[0])\n    h = int(first_line[1])\n    m = int(first_line[2])\n    \n    arr = [h + 1] * n\n    \n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(m):\n        parts = data[index].split()\n        index += 1\n        if not parts:\n            continue\n        l = int(parts[0])\n        r = int(parts[1])\n        x_val = int(parts[2])\n        for j in range(l - 1, r):\n            if x_val < arr[j]:\n                arr[j] = x_val\n                \n    for j in range(n):\n        if arr[j] == h + 1:\n            arr[j] = h\n            \n    profit = 0\n    for height in arr:\n        profit += height * height\n        \n    print(profit)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first line contains the number of houses `n`, the maximum height `h`, and the number of restrictions `m`.\n2. **Initialization**: An array `arr` is initialized with values set to `h + 1`, indicating no restrictions have been applied yet. Each house starts with the global maximum height `h`.\n3. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, the code updates the `arr` values for the houses in the specified interval `[l, r]` to the minimum of their current value and the restriction's maximum height `x_i`. This ensures all overlapping restrictions are considered.\n4. **Adjusting Unrestricted Houses**: After processing all restrictions, any house still marked with `h + 1` (indicating no restrictions applied) is set to `h`.\n5. **Calculating Profit**: The profit is computed by summing the squares of the final heights of all houses and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints by leveraging the fact that each house's maximum allowable height is dictated by the tightest applicable restriction, ensuring optimal profit while compliance is maintained.",
