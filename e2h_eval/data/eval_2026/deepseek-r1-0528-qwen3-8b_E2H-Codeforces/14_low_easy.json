He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10, which is the min of the number of 2s and 5s (but there are usually more 2s). So we count the number of 5s.\n\n Let f(n) = number of trailing zeros in n!.\n We have: f(n) = n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ...\n\n The problem: Given m (1 <= m <= 100000), find all positive integers n such that f(n) = m.\n\n However, note that the function f(n) is non-decreasing. But consecutive n might have the same number of trailing zeros for several numbers (like from 5 to 9, f(5)=1, f(6)=1, etc.)\n\n Observation:\n   For a given m, we are to find all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n But note: f(n) is constant over intervals. For example, \n   f(0)=0, f(1)=0, f(2)=0, f(3)=0, f(4)=0, f(5)=1, f(6)=1, ... until n=9 -> 1, then at n=10, f(10)=2.\n\n However, the problem states: \n   Input: m (from 1 to 100000)\n   Output: First print k (the number of integers n satisfying the condition) and then these k integers in increasing order.\n\n How to approach?\n\n We cannot iterate n from 1 upwards because m can be up to 100000, and n might be very large (since trailing zeros grow logarithmically).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Then, we can look for the range of n where f(n) = m.\n\n However, note: the problem asks for n such that f(n) = m. There might be multiple n with the same m.\n\n But note: the factorial function's trailing zeros increases as n increases, but sometimes stays the same for several n.\n\n Example: \n   m = 1: n from 5 to 9 -> 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9.\n\n 2. How to compute the smallest n for which f(n) >= m? We can use binary search.\n\n However, note: we need to know the exact n where the trailing zeros become m and then remain m until the next multiple of 5 (or power of 5) comes.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   Let L(m) be the smallest n such that f(n) >= m, and R(m) be the largest n such that f(n) < m+1? Actually, we want the n such that f(n)=m.\n\n   Actually, we can define:\n\n      Let low(m) = the smallest n such that f(n) == m? Not exactly, because we might jump from m-1 to m at a certain n, and then the next jump is at a higher n.\n\n   Instead, we can:\n\n      Step 1: Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Call this L.\n\n      Step 2: Then, we need to find the largest n such that f(n) == m. \n\n      But note: the condition f(n)=m holds for a contiguous set of n. However, it is possible that there is no n such that f(n)=m? Actually, for each m, we are guaranteed that if m is in the range [f(n_min), f(n_max)] then there exists an n.\n\n      However, note: the trailing zeros function f(n) takes every integer value? No, it skips some. For example, between 0 and 1, we have 0 trailing zeros for n=0 to 4, then jumps to 1 at n=5. Then at n=10, we get 2. But what about m=3? It appears at n=15 (because 15//5 + 15//25 = 3+0 = 3). So actually, the function f(n) is strictly increasing in the sense that when it increases, it increases by the multiplicity of 5s at the step (which is the number of times 5 divides the current n). But note that the increase is not always by 1.\n\n      However, the problem says: \"the number of positive integers n such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes\". And note that m is given (from 1 to 100000). So we are only concerned with m that appear.\n\n      But note: the problem does not guarantee that every m in [1, 100000] appears. For example",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of \\( n \\) values that satisfy the given condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is essentially the number of times 5 appears in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This is calculated as \\( f(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: Given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) (let's call it `lower_bound`) where \\( f(n) \\geq m \\) and the largest \\( n \\) (let's call it `upper_bound`) where \\( f(n) < m+1 \\). The valid \\( n \\) values are those between `lower_bound` and `upper_bound - 1`, inclusive. However, note that if no such \\( n \\) exists (i.e., \\( m \\) is not achievable), we should return an empty list.\n\n3. **Edge Cases Handling**: \n   - If \\( m = 0 \\), all \\( n \\) from 1 to 4 would have zero trailing zeroes, but the problem constraints specify \\( m \\geq 1 \\), so we don't handle \\( m = 0 \\).\n   - For large \\( m \\), the corresponding \\( n \\) might be very large, so binary search is efficient to avoid brute force.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeroes(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(input().strip())\n    \n    # If m is 0, then according to the problem constraints (m>=1) we skip.\n    # We'll perform binary search to find the lower bound and upper bound for n.\n    \n    low, high = 0, 10**18  # Setting a high bound; 10^18 is sufficiently large.\n    \n    # Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m\n    left_bound = None\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        zeroes = count_trailing_zeroes(mid)\n        if zeroes >= m:\n            left_bound = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n            \n    if left_bound is None:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    # Now find the upper bound: the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1\n    low2, high2 = left_bound, 10**18\n    right_bound = None\n    while low2 <= high2:\n        mid = (low2 + high2) // 2\n        zeroes = count_trailing_zeroes(mid)\n        if zeroes >= m + 1:\n            right_bound = mid\n            high2 = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low2 = mid + 1\n            \n    if right_bound is None:\n        right_bound = left_bound\n        \n    # The valid n are from left_bound to right_bound - 1.\n    start = left_bound\n    end = right_bound - 1\n    \n    if start > end:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    k = end - start + 1\n    print(k)\n    if k > 0:\n        # Format the output: first k, then the numbers from start to end.\n        numbers = [str(i) for i in range(start, end + 1)]\n        print(\" \".join(numbers))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeroes(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the divisor exceeds \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Lower Bound**: The first binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) (left_bound) where the trailing zeroes count is at least \\( m \\). This is done by adjusting the search range based on whether the midpoint's trailing zeroes count meets or exceeds \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Binary Search for Upper Bound**: The second binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) (right_bound) where the trailing zeroes count is at least \\( m+1 \\). The valid \\( n \\) values are those from left_bound to right_bound - 1.\n\n4. **Output Handling**: If no \\( n \\) is found (i.e., left_bound exceeds the upper bound), the output is 0. Otherwise, the count of valid \\( n \\) values is printed, followed by the values themselves in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the range of \\( n \\) values using binary search, leveraging the non-decreasing nature of the trailing zeroes function, and handles edge cases appropriately.",
