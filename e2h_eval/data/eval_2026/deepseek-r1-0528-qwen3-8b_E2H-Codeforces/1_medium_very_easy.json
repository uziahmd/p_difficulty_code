The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The problem states that the first ring goes along the edge of the plate (which is a rectangle of w x h).\n Then, the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge, and so on.\n\n Each ring has a width of 1 cell. The i-th ring is defined for the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)).\n But note: the ring itself is the border of that inner rectangle. However, we must be cautious because the problem says \"all bordering cells\".\n\n How many cells does the i-th ring have?\n Consider the outer rectangle for the i-th ring: \n   Let n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n   Let m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n The border (ring) of an n_i x m_i rectangle is:\n   Top row: m_i cells\n   Bottom row: m_i cells\n   Left and right columns: but note that the corners are shared.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the border as:\n   Total cells in the rectangle: n_i * m_i\n   Inner rectangle (if any) would be (n_i-2) x (m_i-2) for the next ring, but for the border itself:\n\n   The border has: \n     top: m_i\n     bottom: m_i\n     left: n_i - 2 (excluding the two corners already counted in top and bottom)\n     right: n_i - 2\n\n   So total for the ring: 2*m_i + 2*(n_i - 2) = 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4.\n\n However, note that the problem says the first ring is the outer one. But wait: what if we try with the example?\n\n Example 1: \"3 3 1\" -> output 8.\n   For i=1: n_1 = 3, m_1 = 3.\n   Using the formula: 2*3 + 2*3 - 4 = 6+6-4 = 8. That matches.\n\n Example 2: \"7 9 1\" -> output 28.\n   i=1: n_1=7, m_1=9 -> 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14+18-4 = 32, but expected is 28.\n\n Wait, let me check the example: \n   The plate is 7x9, the outer ring should be the border of the 7x9 rectangle.\n\n   Actually, the border of a 7x9 rectangle: \n     top: 9, bottom: 9, left: 7-2=5, right: 7-2=5 -> total 9+9+5+5 = 28.\n\n   But wait, why did we use the formula 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4? That gives 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4 = 32.\n\n   Let's break down the border properly:\n     The top and bottom rows: each has 9 cells (for top and bottom). But the sides are the middle part: \n        The sides (left and right) have 7-2 = 5 cells each.\n\n   So total = 9 (top) + 9 (bottom) + 5 (left) + 5 (right) = 28.\n\n   Alternatively, we can also calculate by:\n        (perimeter of the rectangle) minus 4 (because the four corners are counted twice in the perimeter calculation? Actually no, the standard way to compute the perimeter is 2*(n_i+m_i), but that counts edges, not cells.\n\n   Another way: \n        The total number of cells in the border is:\n          = 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4   [because the four corners are included in both the horizontal and vertical edges, so we subtract the four corners once?]\n\n   But wait, if we do 2*n_i + 2*m_i, that counts the entire frame including the corners being counted twice (each corner is counted in a horizontal and a vertical segment). \n\n   Actually, consider the frame as two parts: the top and bottom, and the left and right without the corners.\n\n   The correct way is: \n        top row: m_i\n        bottom row: m_i\n        left column: n_i - 2 (excluding the top and bottom)\n        right column: n_i - 2\n\n   So total = m_i + m_i + (n_i-2) + (n_i-2) = 2*m_i + 2*(n_i-2) = 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4.\n\n   But then for 7x9: 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4 = 32, which is not 28.\n\n   What's wrong? \n\n   Let me recast: \n        The top row: 9 cells, but then the left and right columns include the top and bottom rows. Actually, the entire border is:\n\n        We can also compute by: (number of cells in the rectangle) - (number of cells in the inner rectangle) but the inner rectangle is (n_i-2) x (m_i-2) only if n_i>=3 and m_i>=3.\n\n        For 7x9: total cells = 63, inner rectangle for the next ring would be 5x7, so the border is 63 - (5*7) = 63-35=28.\n\n   So the border for a rectangle of n_i x m_i is: \n        area_i = n_i * m_i\n        If we remove the inner (n_i-2) x (m_i-2) then we get the border: \n            border_i = n_i*m_i - (n_i-2)*(m_i-2)\n\n        Let's compute: \n            (n_i)*(m_i) - (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) = n_i*m_i - [n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i +4] = 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4.\n\n        But wait, this is the same formula! Then for 7x9: 2*7+2*9-4= 14+18-4=32, but 7*9=63, (7-2)*(9-2)=5*7=35, 63-35=28.\n\n        There is a contradiction: the algebraic expansion is correct, but 2*n_i+2*m_i-4 = 2*(7)+2*(9)-4 = 14+18-4=32, but 28 != 32.\n\n   Let me expand again:\n        (n_i)*(m_i) - (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) \n        = n_i*m_i - [n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i + 4]\n        = n_i*m_i - n_i*m_i + 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4\n        = 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4\n\n   But 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4 = 32, and 7*9=63, 5*7=35, 63-35=28.\n\n   So 32 != 28.\n\n   I see the mistake: the inner rectangle is (n_i-2) x (m_i-2) only if we are removing a border of 1 cell from each side. But note: the border is 1 cell wide, so the inner part is indeed (n_i-2) x (m_i-2). \n\n   However, the algebraic expansion is correct, but let me plug in the numbers:\n\n        (7-2)*(9-2) = 5*7 = 35, and 7*9=63, so the border is 63-35=28.\n\n   But the expression 2*n_i+2*m_i-4 is 2*7+2*9-4= 14+18-4=32.\n\n   Why the discrepancy? Because the formula (n_i)*(m_i) - (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) is correct, and it equals 2*n_i+2*m_i-4, but wait:\n\n        (n_i)*(m_i) - (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) \n        = n_i*m_i - (n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i + 4)\n        = 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4\n\n   So 2*7+2*9-4=32, but when we compute 63-35=28, so 32 != 28.\n\n   Let me recalculate the expansion:\n\n        (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) = n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i + 4\n\n   Then subtracting from n_i*m_i: \n        n_i*m_i - (n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i + 4) = 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4.\n\n   Now, 2*7+2*9-4= 14+18-4=32, but 7*9=63, (7-2)*(9-2)=5*7=35, and 63-35=28.\n\n   This indicates that the expansion is correct, but the arithmetic: 63 - 35 is 28, and 2*7+2*9-4 is 32. \n\n   Wait, let me check the expansion again with numbers:\n\n        (7-2)*(9-2) = 5*7 = 35, and that is correct.\n\n        Then 63 - 35 = 28.\n\n        But the expansion: \n          2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4 = 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14+18-4=32.\n\n   So there is an error in the expansion? \n\n   Let me do the expansion step by step:\n\n        (n_i)*(m_i) = 7*9=63\n        (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) = (7-2)*(9-2)=5*7=35\n\n        Then 63 - 35 = 28.\n\n        Now, the expanded form: \n          (n_i)*(m_i) - (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) = n_i*m_i - (n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i + 4) \n          = n_i*m_i - n_i*m_i + 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4\n          = 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4.\n\n        So for n_i=7, m_i=9: 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4=32.\n\n        But 28 != 32.\n\n   I see the mistake: the expansion is correct, but note that the inner rectangle is (n_i-2) x (m_i-2) only if we are removing two cells from each dimension. However, the formula for the border is:\n\n        border_i = n_i*m_i - (n_i-2)*(m_i-2)\n\n   and that is correct. But the expansion is:\n\n        (n_i)*(m_i) - (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) \n        = n_i*m_i - (n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i + 4)\n        = 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4.\n\n   This expansion is algebraically correct. Then why for 7 and 9 we get 28 and not 32?\n\n   Let me do the expansion without plugging numbers:\n\n        (n_i)*(m_i) = n_i * m_i\n        (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) = n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i + 4\n\n        Then subtracting: \n            n_i*m_i - (n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i + 4) = 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4.\n\n   Now, if I plug n_i=7, m_i=9:\n\n        Step 1: 7*9 = 63\n        Step 2: 5*7 = 35\n        Step 3: 63 - 35 = 28.\n\n        And 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4=32.\n\n   So 28 != 32.\n\n   The issue is: the expansion is correct, but wait, let me recalc the expansion:\n\n        (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) = n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i + 4   -> this is correct.\n\n        Then subtracting from n_i*m_i: \n            n_i*m_i - (n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i + 4) = 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4.\n\n        So 2*n_i+2*m_i-4 = 2*(7)+2*(9)-4 = 14+18-4 = 32.\n\n        But 63 - 35 = 28.\n\n   This means that 2*n_i+2*m_i-4 is not equal to the expression (n_i*m_i - (n_i-2)*(m_i-2))? \n\n   Wait, let me compute (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) without expanding:\n\n        (7-2)*(9-2) = 5*7 = 35.\n\n        Then 7*9 - 35 = 63-35=28.\n\n        Now, 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4=32.\n\n   Therefore, the expression (n_i*m_i - (n_i-2)*(m_i-2)) is not equal to 2*n_i+2*m_i-4? \n\n   But wait, the expansion shows:\n\n        (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) = n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i + 4.\n\n        Then  n_i*m_i - (n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i + 4) = 2*n_i+2*m_i-4.\n\n   So the expansion is correct. Then why 2*7+2*9-4 is 32, but 63-35 is 28?\n\n   I see the error: the expansion is correct, but note that the expansion is:\n\n        (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) = n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i + 4   [This is correct]\n\n        Then, the border = n_i*m_i - (n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i + 4) = 2*n_i+2*m_i-4.\n\n   So for n_i=7, m_i=9:\n\n        2*n_i+2*m_i-4 = 2*7 + 2*9 -4 = 14+18-4 = 32.\n\n   But wait, how did we get 28 by direct subtraction? \n\n        Direct subtraction: 7*9 - 5*7 = 63 - 35 = 28.\n\n   And 5*7 is (7-2)*(9-2)=5*7=35, so that is correct.\n\n   Then the expansion must be wrong? \n\n   Let me expand (n_i-2)*(m_i-2):\n\n        (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) = n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i + 4   -> Correct.\n\n        Then, 63 - (63 - 2*7 - 2*9 + 4) \n        = 63 - (63 - 14 - 18 + 4)\n        = 63 - (63 - 32) \n        = 63 - 31 = 32.\n\n   Wait, now I get 32.\n\n   But wait, 2*7+2*9 is 14+18=32, then subtract 4: 32-4=28? No, wait: \n\n        (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) = n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i + 4 = 63 - 14 - 18 + 4 = 63 - 32 + 4 = 63 - 28 = 35? \n\n   Let me compute: 63 - 14 = 49; 49 - 18 = 31; 31 + 4 = 35.\n\n   So the expansion: n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i + 4 = 63 - 14 - 18 + 4 = 63 - 14 = 49, 49-18=31, 31+4=35.\n\n   Then the border = 63 - 35 = 28.\n\n   And the other expression: 2*n_i+2*m_i-4 = 2*7+2*9-4=14+18-4=32.\n\n   Now, the expansion of the border is:\n\n        border = n_i*m_i - (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) \n               = n_i*m_i - [n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i + 4]\n               = 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4.\n\n   So the expansion is correct, and we get 32, but the direct subtraction gives 28.\n\n   There is a contradiction. \n\n   Actually, the expansion is correct, and the direct subtraction is also correct. \n\n   But wait, the expansion:\n\n        border = n_i*m_i - (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) \n               = n_i*m_i - (n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i + 4)\n               = 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4.\n\n   And for 7x9: 2*7+2*9-4=32, but 7*9 - (5*7)=63-35=28.\n\n   This indicates that the expansion is not matching the direct computation.\n\n   Let me recompute the expansion:\n\n        (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) = n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i + 4   [This is correct]\n\n        Then, \n            n_i*m_i - (n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i + 4) = 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4.\n\n   And for 7x9: 2*7+2*9-4=32.\n\n   But wait, 7*9=63, and (7-2)*(9-2)=5*7=35, and 63-35=28.\n\n   So the issue is: the expansion (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) = n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i + 4 is correct, but then:\n\n        border = n_i*m_i - (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) = 63 - 35 = 28.\n\n        And 2*n_i+2*m_i-4 = 32.\n\n   This implies that 28 != 32.\n\n   But wait, the expansion step-by-step:\n\n        (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) = 5*7 = 35.\n        And n_i*m_i - (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) = 63-35=28.\n\n        Now, the expanded form of (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) is 7*9 - 2*7 - 2*9 + 4 = 63 -14 -18+4 = 63-32+4= 35 (as above).\n\n        Then, 63 - 35 = 28.\n\n        And the expression 2*n_i+2*m_i-4 = 14+18-4=32.\n\n   So the two ways to compute the border are:\n\n        Way1: (n_i)*(m_i) - (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) = 63 - 35 = 28.\n        Way2: 2*n_i+2*m_i-4 = 32.\n\n   They are different. \n\n   Therefore, the expansion is not the same as the direct subtraction? \n\n   Let me expand (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) again:\n\n        (n_i-2)*(m_i-2) = n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i + 4   [This is correct]\n\n        Then, \n            border = n_i*m_i - (n_i*m_i - 2*n_i - 2*m_i + 4) \n                   = 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4.\n\n   But wait, the expansion of the border is correct, but when we plug in the numbers we get 32, but the direct subtraction of the areas is 28.\n\n   The catch: the expansion is correct, but the direct subtraction is also correct. \n\n   However, note that the border is the outer layer. In our example, the inner rectangle is (n_i-2) x (m_i-2) only if the entire border is removed. But the border is one cell thick. \n\n   The problem states: the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)). \n\n   But note: the inner rectangle is reduced by 2 in each dimension (because we remove one cell from the top/bottom and one from the left/right). \n\n   The total cells of the ring is the difference between the entire rectangle and the inner rectangle.\n\n   So the formula is correct: \n        ring_i = (w_i * h_i) - (max(0, w_i-2)*max(0, h_i-2))\n\n   However, we must ensure that if w_i-2 < 0 or h_i-2 < 0 then we don't subtract anything (but k is chosen such that the inner rectangle is nonnegative).\n\n   But wait, the example input constraint: k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n   For the example \"7 9 1\": \n        w_i = 7, h_i = 9 -> ring_1 = 7*9 - (5*7) = 63-35=28.\n\n   Now, the formula 2*w_i+2*h_i-4 = 2*7+2*9-4=32, which is not 28.\n\n   So why did the expansion lead to 2*w_i+2*h_i-4? \n\n   Let me derive the border count differently:\n\n        The border has:\n          top row: h_i cells\n          bottom row: h_i cells\n          left column: w_i - 2 (excluding the two corners already counted in top and bottom)\n          right column: w_i - 2\n\n        Total = h_i + h_i + (w_i-2) + (w_i-2) = 2*h_i + 2*(w_i-2) = 2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4.\n\n   Now, for 7x9: 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4=32.\n\n   But wait, if we count the top row: 9 cells (the entire top row of the 7x9)\n   bottom row: 9 cells.\n   left column: from row1 to row7, but we already counted the first and last row, so we have rows 2 to 6: 5 cells.\n   right column: similarly 5 cells.\n\n   Total: 9+9+5+5 = 28.\n\n   So the formula by counting the sides is: 2*h_i + 2*(w_i-2) = 2*9 + 2*(7-2) = 18 + 10 = 28.\n\n   But wait, 2*(w_i-2) is 2*5=10, and 2*h_i is 18, so 18+10=28.\n\n   But the formula I wrote above was: 2*h_i + 2*(w_i-2) = 2*9 + 2*5 = 18+10=28.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write: 2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4 is not the same as 2*h_i + 2*(w_i-2). \n\n   Let me express 2*h_i + 2*(w_i-2) = 2*h_i + 2*w_i - 4.\n\n   So it is the same as 2*w_i+2*h_i-4.\n\n   But wait, 2*w_i+2*h_i-4 is the same as 2*h_i+2*w_i-4.\n\n   Then why in the example 7x9: 2*7+2*9-4=32, but by counting we got 28?\n\n   The counting method: \n        top: h_i = 9\n        bottom: h_i = 9\n        left: w_i-2 = 5\n        right: w_i-2 = 5\n        Total: 9+9+5+5=28.\n\n   But 2*w_i+2*h_i-4 = 2*7+2*9-4=14+18-4=32.\n\n   Now, note: 2*w_i+2*h_i-4 = 2*(w_i+h_i)-4.\n\n   And 2*h_i+2*(w_i-2)= 2*h_i+2*w_i-4 = 2*(w_i+h_i)-4.\n\n   So they are the same. \n\n   Then why is 2*(w_i+h_i)-4 = 2*(7+9)-4=2*16-4=32, but the count is 28?\n\n   The catch: the sides are not independent. \n\n   Actually, the counting method is correct: \n        top row: h_i = 9\n        bottom row: h_i = 9\n        left column: excluding the top and bottom, so w_i-2 = 5\n        right column: same, 5.\n\n   So the total is 9+9+5+5=28.\n\n   But the formula 2*w_i+2*h_i-4 = 2*(7+9)-4=32.\n\n   This means that the formula by sides is not the same as the algebraic expression?\n\n   Let me break down the algebraic expression:\n\n        The entire rectangle has w_i * h_i = 7*9=63.\n\n        The inner rectangle has (w_i-2)*(h_i-2)=5*7=35.\n\n        The border is 63-35=28.\n\n   So the area method is correct.\n\n   The side-counting method is also correct.\n\n   But note: the side-counting method uses the dimensions: \n        top and bottom: h_i (which is 9) for two sides -> 18.\n        left and right: (w_i-2) for two sides -> 10.\n\n        Total: 18+10=28.\n\n   Now, how is that represented in terms of w_i and h_i?\n\n        It is: 2*h_i + 2*(w_i-2) = 2*9 + 2*5 = 18+10=28.\n\n   And 2*h_i+2*(w_i-2) = 2*h_i + 2*w_i - 4.\n\n   And 2*w_i+2*h_i-4 is the same.\n\n   But wait, 2*h_i+2*w_i-4 = 2*9+2*7-4= 18+14-4=28.\n\n   So I made a mistake earlier: \n\n        I said: 2*w_i+2*h_i-4 = 2*7+2*9-4=14+18-4=32.\n\n   But actually, the order doesn't matter because addition is commutative: 2*w_i+2*h_i-4 = 2*h_i+2*w_i-4.\n\n   And 2*7+2*9=14+18=32, then minus 4 is 28? \n\n   Wait, 32-4=28? No, 32-4 is 28? \n\n        32-4=28 -> yes, that's correct.\n\n   Wait, no: 32-4 is 28? \n\n        32-4=28 is false: 32-4=28 is incorrect. 32-4=28 is not true. 32-4=28 is false.\n\n   Actually, 32-4=28 is false because 32-4=28 is not correct: 32-4=28 is not true. 32-4=28 is incorrect.\n\n   Let me do the math: \n        32-4=28 -> that is 28=28? Actually, no: 32-4=28 is false because 32-4=28 is 28=28 -> wait, 32-4=28 is 28=28, which is true.\n\n   Wait, no: 32-4=28 is true? \n\n        32-4=28 -> 28=28, so yes, it is true.\n\n   But wait, 32-4 is 28? \n\n        Let me compute: 32-4=28 -> 32-4=28 is true.\n\n   But wait, 32-4=28 is true.\n\n   Then what's the issue? \n\n   The issue is that I initially thought 2*7+2*9-4 was 32, and then subtracting 4 gives 28. \n\n   But wait, 2*7+2*9-4 is (2*7)+(2*9)-4 = 14+18-4=32-4=28.\n\n   So the formula is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the number of cells for the i-th ring is:\n\n        Let w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        Let h_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n        Then, if w_i <= 0 or h_i <= 0, then we break (but k is chosen so that we only consider rings that are valid).\n\n        The number of cells for the i-th ring is: 2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4.\n\n   But wait, let me test with the example \"3 3 1\":\n\n        w_i = 3, h_i = 3.\n        Cells = 2*3 + 2*3 -4 = 6+6-4=8 -> correct.\n\n   Example \"7 9 1\": 2*7+2*9-4=14+18-4=32-4=28 -> correct.\n\n   Example \"7 9 2\": \n        First ring: i=1 -> w1=7, h1=9 -> 28.\n        Second ring: i=2 -> w2=7-4=3, h2=9-4=5.\n        Cells for second ring = 2*3+2*5-4=6+10-4=12.\n\n        Then total gilded cells = 28+12=40 -> matches the example.\n\n   However, note the example input: \n        Input: \"7 9 2\" -> Output: 40.\n\n   Therefore, we can compute the total cells by summing over i from 1 to k:\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(1, k+1):\n            w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n            h_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n            if w_i <= 0 or h_i <= 0: \n                # But k is chosen so that we don't go below, so this might not occur, but just to be safe.\n                break\n            ring_cells = 2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4\n            total += ring_cells\n\n   But wait, what if w_i==0 or h_i==0? Then the ring wouldn't exist. The problem says k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4), so the inner rectangle will be at least 1x1 (because after k rings, the inner rectangle is (w-4*(k-1)) x (h-4*(k-1)), and since k<=floor((min(w,h)+1)/4), then w-4*(k-1) >= min(w,h) - 4*(k-1) >= min(w,h) - 4*((min(w,h)+1)//4 - 1) ... but anyway, the constraint ensures that we don't go negative.\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute without breaking by using the constraint.\n\n   However, note: the formula for the ring breaks when the inner rectangle becomes too small. But the problem says k is bounded by floor((min(n,m)+1)/4) so we won't have negative dimensions.\n\n   But let me check: \n        k_max = floor((min(w,h)+1)/4)\n\n        Then the smallest rectangle we consider for the last ring is (w-4*(k_max-1)) x (h-4*(k_max-1)).\n\n        Since k_max <= (min(w,h)+1)//4, then 4*k_max <= min(w,h)+1, so w-4*(k_max-1) >= w - (min(w,h)+1-4) [if k_max is the maximum] ... but we don't need to worry because the input constraint ensures we don't go negative.\n\n   Therefore, we can simply:\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(1, k+1):\n            w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n            h_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n            # Since k is bounded, w_i and h_i are positive.\n            ring_cells = 2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4\n            total += ring_cells\n\n   But wait, the example \"3 3 1\": \n        i=1: w_i=3, h_i=3 -> ring_cells=2*3+2*3-4=6+6-4=8 -> correct.\n\n   Example \"7 9 1\": 28 -> correct.\n\n   Example \"7 9 2\": 28+12=40 -> correct.\n\n   However, note that the problem says the first ring goes along the edge, the second 2 cells away, etc.\n\n   But wait, the example \"3 3 1\" is a 3x3 plate. The first ring uses the entire border, which is 8 cells. \n\n   But in a 3x3 plate, the border is 8 cells. \n\n   Now, consider a 5x5 plate and k=1:\n\n        w_i=5, h_i=5.\n        ring_cells=2*5+2*5-4=10+10-4=16.\n\n        Alternatively, the border of a 5x5: \n            top:5, bottom:5, left:3, right:3 -> 5+5+3+3=16.\n\n        And the entire plate has 25 cells, the inner is 3x3=9, so 25-9=16.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Therefore, the solution is to sum the rings from i=1 to k.\n\n   However, note that the problem says the i-th ring is defined for the inner rectangle of size (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)), and the ring is the border of that rectangle.\n\n   We assume that the entire ring is present. \n\n   But note: the problem states that the plate is split into w x h cells.\n\n   So the code:\n\n        Read w, h, k.\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            # i from 0 to k-1, so the i-th ring (0-indexed) corresponds to (i+1)-th ring.\n            # But note: the first ring is i=0: \n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is placed 2 cells away from the previous one, starting from the edge of the plate. The solution involves determining the number of cells in each ring and summing them up.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The plate is represented as a rectangle of size \\( w \\times h \\). The first ring is the outermost border of this rectangle. Each subsequent ring is formed by moving 2 cells inward from the previous ring. The width of each ring is 1 cell.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each ring \\( i \\), the inner rectangle dimensions are \\( (w - 4(i-1)) \\times (h - 4(i-1)) \\). The number of cells in the \\( i \\)-th ring is calculated as the difference between the area of the current rectangle and the area of the next inner rectangle (if any). This can be simplified using the formula \\( 2 \\times w_i + 2 \\times h_i - 4 \\), where \\( w_i \\) and \\( h_i \\) are the dimensions of the current rectangle.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate from 1 to \\( k \\) (the number of rings), compute the dimensions of the current rectangle for each iteration, apply the formula to find the number of cells in that ring, and accumulate the total count.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in \\( O(k) \\) time, which is efficient given the constraints \\( 3 \\leq w, h \\leq 100 \\) and \\( 1 \\leq k \\leq \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\min(w, h) + 1}{4} \\right\\rfloor \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, k+1):\n        w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        h_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n        if w_i <= 0 or h_i <= 0:\n            break\n        ring_cells = 2 * w_i + 2 * h_i - 4\n        total += ring_cells\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers \\( w \\), \\( h \\), and \\( k \\), representing the plate dimensions and the number of rings, respectively.\n2. **Initialization**: The variable `total` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the cumulative number of gilded cells.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to \\( k \\):\n   - **Calculate Dimensions**: The dimensions of the current rectangle are derived by subtracting \\( 4(i-1) \\) from both \\( w \\) and \\( h \\), accounting for the inward shift of each subsequent ring.\n   - **Check Validity**: If either dimension becomes non-positive, the loop breaks early as further rings would not be valid.\n   - **Compute Ring Cells**: The number of cells in the current ring is calculated using the formula \\( 2 \\times w_i + 2 \\times h_i - 4 \\), which effectively computes the perimeter of the current rectangle adjusted for overlapping corners.\n4. **Output Result**: The accumulated total of gilded cells is printed after processing all rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired result by leveraging geometric properties and iterative summation, ensuring correctness within the problem constraints.",
