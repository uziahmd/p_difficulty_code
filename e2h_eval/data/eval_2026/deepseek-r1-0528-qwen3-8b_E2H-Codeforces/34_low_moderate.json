And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read the first line to get n and k.\n Then, read the next line which has n integers.\n\n There are (n - k + 1) weeks. For each week, we take k consecutive days and compute the average for that week.\n Then we are to output the overall average of these averages? But note: the example input [3,4,7] with k=2 and n=3 gives two weeks: [3,4] and [4,7]. The average for the first week is (3+4)/2 = 3.5, for the second week (4+7)/2 = 5.5. Then the overall average is (3.5+5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5? But wait, the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n Let me check the example again: \n Input: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\"\n The example says: then the result is 9.0000000000.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"calculate average sleeping time over all weeks.\" \n\n But note: there are two weeks. The total sleep over all weeks is (3+4) + (4+7) = 3+4+4+7 = 18. And there are two weeks? Then the average per week would be 18 / 2 = 9. However, wait: the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n However, the problem states: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\" but then says \"over all weeks\". \n\n Let's read carefully: \n \"To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration.\"\n\n Then the example: \"if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is ...\"\n\n What does the example say? It doesn't show the intermediate steps, but the output is 9.0.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"Output average sleeping time over all weeks.\"\n\n There are two interpretations:\n 1. The average of the averages of each week. That would be ( (3+4)/2 + (4+7)/2 ) / 2 = (3.5 + 5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5, but that's not 9.\n 2. The overall average per week by considering the entire dataset? \n\n Alternatively, note that the total sleep hours in the entire period (all weeks) is the sum of all sleep times multiplied by the number of times each day is included?\n\n Actually, let's break down the two weeks:\n Week 1: days 1 and 2 -> sleep = 3+4\n Week 2: days 2 and 3 -> sleep = 4+7\n\n So the total sleep from both weeks is 3+4+4+7 = 18.\n\n Since there are two weeks, the average per week is 18 / 2 = 9.\n\n But wait, is that what the problem wants? The problem says \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\", meaning for each week we have an average, and then we take the average of these weekly averages? Or is it the total sleep divided by the total number of days (but that's not the same because each week is k days, but we are averaging over weeks, not days).\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\" and then \"calculate average sleeping time over all weeks\".\n\n Clarification: \n We have several weeks (each week is k consecutive days). We can define:\n   total_sleep = sum_{week} (sum of sleep in that week)\n\n Then, the average per week is total_sleep / (number of weeks)\n\n But note: the example has two weeks and total_sleep=18, so 18/2=9.\n\n However, let's check the second example: \"1 1\\n10\"\n n=1, k=1 -> one week. total_sleep = 10, number of weeks=1 -> 10/1=10.\n\n Third example: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n n=8, k=2 -> 7 weeks.\n We need to compute the sum of the sleep for each consecutive two days, then add them all up, then divide by 7.\n\n Let's compute the total_sleep for the third example:\n\n Days: [1,2,4,10000",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all weeks, where each week consists of `k` consecutive days. The solution involves reading the input values, computing the sum of sleep times for each week, and then determining the overall average by dividing the total sum of all weekly sleep times by the number of weeks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the integers `n` (number of days) and `k` (days per week) from the first line of input. Then, read the list of `n` integers representing the sleep times for each day.\n2. **Total Sleep Calculation**: Compute the total sleep time for all possible weeks. Each week is defined by `k` consecutive days, and there are `n - k + 1` such weeks. The total sleep time is the sum of sleep times for all these weeks.\n3. **Average Calculation**: The overall average sleep time per week is obtained by dividing the total sleep time by the number of weeks (`n - k + 1`).\n4. **Output**: Print the result formatted to a string with 10 decimal places to ensure precision as required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    total_sleep = 0\n    \n    for i in range(total_weeks):\n        start_index = i\n        end_index = i + k\n        week_sum = sum(a[start_index:end_index])\n        total_sleep += week_sum\n        \n    average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first two values are `n` (number of days) and `k` (days per week). The subsequent values are the sleep times for each day.\n2. **Total Weeks Calculation**: The number of weeks is calculated as `n - k + 1`, which accounts for all possible consecutive `k`-day periods in the given `n` days.\n3. **Summing Sleep Times**: For each week (from the first to the last), the sum of sleep times for that week is computed by slicing the list `a` from the start index `i` to `i + k`. This sum is added to a running total (`total_sleep`).\n4. **Average Calculation**: The average sleep time per week is derived by dividing `total_sleep` by the number of weeks (`total_weeks`). The result is formatted to 10 decimal places to meet the precision requirement.\n5. **Output**: The formatted average is printed, ensuring the output meets the specified precision constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average by leveraging simple iteration and arithmetic operations, ensuring correctness and optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
