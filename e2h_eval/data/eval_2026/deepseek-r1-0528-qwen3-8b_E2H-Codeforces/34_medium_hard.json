And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read the first line to get n and k.\n Then, read the next line which has n integers.\n\n There are (n - k + 1) weeks. Each week is k consecutive days.\n\n We need to compute the average sleep time over all weeks.\n\n However, note that the total sum of sleep times for all weeks is the sum of:\n   For week starting at i: sum(a[i] to a[i+k-1])\n\n Then, the average over all weeks is (total_sum) / (number_of_weeks) \n where number_of_weeks = (n - k + 1).\n\n But note: if we try to compute each week's sum separately by iterating over k elements for each week, that would be O(n*k) which is too slow for n, k up to 200,000.\n\n Instead, we can use a prefix sum array.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read n, k and the list of sleep times.\n 2. Compute the prefix sum array `pref` such that:\n      pref[0] = 0\n      pref[i] = a0 + a1 + ... + a{i-1}\n\n    Then the sum from index i to j (inclusive) is pref[j+1] - pref[i].\n\n 3. The total sum for all weeks is:\n      total = 0\n      for start_index in range(0, n - k + 1):\n          end_index = start_index + k - 1\n          total += (pref[end_index+1] - pref[start_index])\n\n 4. Then, average = total / (n - k + 1)\n\n However, note: n can be up to 200000 and k can be up to 200000, so the above loop runs (n-k+1) times which is about 200000 - 200000 + 1 = 1? Actually worst-case when k=1, then we have 200000 weeks. So the loop runs 200000 times, and each step does a constant time operation. This is acceptable.\n\n But wait: if k is large and n is large, then the number of weeks is n-k+1, which is still about 200000, so it's acceptable.\n\n However, we can also compute the total sum without a loop by using the prefix array and then:\n\n      total = 0\n      for i in range(0, n - k + 1):\n          total += pref[i+k] - pref[i]\n\n But note: the prefix array is built so that the sum from i to j is pref[j+1]-pref[i]. Here, we want from i to i+k-1, so j = i+k-1, then:\n      sum = pref[i+k] - pref[i]\n\n But wait, let me check with an example: [3,4,7] and k=2, n=3.\n\n  Build prefix: \n      pref[0] = 0\n      pref[1] = 3\n      pref[2] = 3+4 = 7\n      pref[3] = 3+4+7 = 14\n\n  Then, for i=0: use indices 0 to 1 -> sum = pref[2] - pref[0] = 7 - 0 = 7 -> correct.\n        i=1: use indices 1 to 2 -> sum = pref[3] - pref[1] = 14 - 3 = 11 -> but the second week is [4,7] which is 11, correct.\n\n  Then total = 7 + 11 = 18.\n\n  Number of weeks = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2.\n\n  Average = 18 / 2 = 9.0.\n\n  So that matches.\n\n  But note: we can also use the prefix array to avoid the loop? Actually, we still have to iterate over the weeks.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use:\n\n      total = 0\n      for i in range(0, n - k + 1):\n          total += pref[i+k] - pref[i]\n\n  This is acceptable because the number of weeks is n-k+1, which is at most 200000.\n\n  However, we can also use slicing and then sum? But that would be O(k) per week, which is too slow.\n\n  So we stick to the prefix sum and iterate over the weeks.\n\n  But note: we can also precompute the entire prefix sum array in O(n). Then the loop is O(n) (since n-k+1 <= n).\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  However, note that the problem constraints say n up to 200000, and k up to 200000. The worst-case for the loop is when k=1, then we do 200000 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n  But wait, there's another way: we can use the fact that the total sum of all weeks can be expressed as:\n\n      total = (pref[k] - pref[0]) + (pref[k+1]-pref[1]) + ... + (pref[n] - pref[n-k])\n\n  And we can also note that the entire array is fixed, and we are just taking overlapping segments.\n\n  However, we cannot avoid the iteration over the starting index.\n\n  Implementation:\n\n  Step 1: Read n, k and the list a.\n  Step 2: Precompute prefix sums: \n          pref = [0]*(n+1)\n          for i in range(1, n+1):\n              pref[i] = pref[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n  Step 3: total = 0\n          num_weeks = n - k + 1\n          for i in range(0, num_weeks):\n              total += pref[i+k] - pref[i]\n\n  Step 4: average = total / num_weeks\n\n  Step 5: Format the output to have at least 6 decimal places and ensure absolute or relative error <= 1e-6.\n\n  But note: the example outputs have trailing zeros. We can use formatting.\n\n  Example: print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n  However, the third example: \n        Input: 8 2\n               1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\n        Expected Output: 28964.2857142857\n\n  Let me compute manually:\n\n        We have 8 numbers and k=2, so 7 weeks.\n\n        The weeks:\n          week0: [1,2] -> 3\n          week1: [2,4] -> 6\n          week2: [4,100000] -> 100004\n          week3: [100000,123] -> 100123\n          week4: [123,456] -> 579\n          week5: [456,789] -> 1245\n          week6: [789,1] -> 790\n\n        Total = 3 + 6 + 100004 + 100123 + 579 + 1245 + 790 = \n\n        Let me add:\n          3+6=9\n          9+100004=100013\n          100013+100123=200136\n          200136+579=200715\n          200715+1245=201960\n          201960+790=202750\n\n        Then average = 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857... \n\n        So the expected output is 28964.2857142857.\n\n  Therefore, we must format the output to have enough decimal places.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the answer is considered correct if absolute or relative error <= 1e-6.\n\n  Using float division and formatting to 10 decimal places should be safe.\n\n  But note: the numbers can be large (up to 200000 * 100000 = 20e9, and then divided by up to 200000, so the average can be up to 100000, which is within double precision).\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  However, we can also consider performance: building the prefix array is O(n) and the loop is O(n) (because the number of weeks is n-k+1, which is linear). So overall O(n), which is acceptable for n=200000.\n\n  Code:\n\n      n, k = map(int, input().split())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n      # Build prefix sum array of length n+1\n      pref = [0]*(n+1)\n      for i in range(1, n+1):\n          pref[i] = pref[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n      num_weeks = n - k + 1\n      total_sleep = 0.0\n      for i in range(num_weeks):\n          # Each week starts at i, ends at i+k-1\n          # The sum for this week is pref[i+k] - pref[i]\n          total_sleep += pref[i+k] - pref[i]\n\n      average = total_sleep / num_weeks\n\n      # Format the average to have 10 decimal places\n      print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n  But wait, what if k==0? The problem states k>=1, so no problem.\n\n  However, note: the problem says 1<=k<=n<=200000.\n\n  Let me test with the examples.\n\n  Example 1: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\"\n      n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n      pref = [0,3,7,14]\n      num_weeks = 2\n      i=0: total_sleep += pref[2]-pref[0] = 7\n      i=1: total_sleep += pref[3]-pref[1] = 14-3 = 11\n      total_sleep = 18\n      average = 18/2 = 9.0 -> \"9.0000000000\"\n\n  Example 2: \"1 1\\n10\"\n      n=1, k=1, a=[10]\n      pref = [0,10]\n      num_weeks = 1\n      i=0: total_sleep += 10\n      average = 10.0 -> \"10.0000000000\"\n\n  Example 3: already computed above.\n\n  But wait, the third example input is \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\", so we have to read 8 numbers.\n\n  However, note: the example output is 28964.2857142857, and our calculation above was 202750/7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n  But wait, I did the manual calculation and got 202750. However, let's recalc the total_sleep:\n\n      Week0: 1+2 = 3\n      Week1: 2+4 = 6\n      Week2: 4+100000 = 100004\n      Week3: 100000+123 = 100123\n      Week4: 123+456 = 579\n      Week5: 456+789 = 1245\n      Week6: 789+1 = 790\n\n      Sum = 3+6 = 9; 9+100004=100013; 100013+100123=200136; 200136+579=200715; 200715+1245=201960; 201960+790=202750.\n\n      Then 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n  So the code should output 28964.2857142857.\n\n  However, the example output is written as \"28964.2857142857\", which has 10 digits after the decimal.\n\n  Our formatting with {:.10f} will give 10 digits.\n\n  But note: the example output in the problem statement uses 10 digits.\n\n  However, let's run the code with the third example and see.\n\n  But wait: the example input is given as a string in the example, so we have to parse correctly.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use:\n\n      print(f\"{average:.10f}\")\n\n  But the problem requires standard output.\n\n  One more thing: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\" and the input is provided via stdin.\n\n  Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n  However, note: the problem constraints say n and k can be up to 200000, and the numbers a_i up to 10^5.\n\n  The maximum total_sleep can be (n-k+1)* (max value in a) * k. Since k can be 200000 and max value 10^5, then one week could be 200000 * 10^5 = 20e9, and then multiplied by (n-k+1) which is up to 200000, so total_sleep could be 20e9 * 200000 = 4e15, which is beyond the range of Python int? Actually, no, because Python ints are arbitrary precision, but the problem says the answer is real number with at least 6 digits. However, the numbers are integers and the average might be fractional.\n\n  But wait: the problem says the sleep times are integers, but the average is a float.\n\n  We are using float for total_sleep? Actually, the numbers are integers, but the division might not be integer.\n\n  However, the total_sleep is the sum of integers, so it's an integer. Then we divide by an integer (num_weeks) which may not be a divisor.\n\n  But note: the problem does not require integer average.\n\n  However, the maximum total_sleep is (n-k+1) * (max possible sum in a week) = (n-k+1) * (k * 100000). With n,k up to 200000, that's about 200000 * 200000 * 100000 = 4e15, which is a very big integer, but Python can handle integers of that size. However, we are storing total_sleep as a float? \n\n  Wait, in the code above, we did:\n\n      total_sleep = 0.0   -> this initializes as float.\n\n  Then we are adding integers (from the prefix array) to a float. That is okay, but we lose integer precision for very large numbers? \n\n  But note: the maximum total_sleep is 4e15, and the maximum float representation in Python (which is double) can represent integers exactly up to around 2**53 (about 9e15). So 4e15 is safe.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use integer arithmetic until the division. But the problem requires a float output.\n\n  However, to avoid floating point inaccuracies (though the numbers are integers so the division might be inexact) we can use integer arithmetic and then convert to float.\n\n  But the problem allows absolute or relative error <= 1e-6, so even if we use floating point and the numbers are integers, the rounding errors should be negligible.\n\n  But let's change to use integer for the total_sleep and then divide by integer num_weeks.\n\n  Since the total_sleep is an integer, we can do:\n\n      average = total_sleep / num_weeks\n\n  In Python, if we use integer division, we get a float? Actually, if we use / then it's float division.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      total_sleep_int = 0   # as integer\n      ... (then add integers)\n\n      average = total_sleep_int / num_weeks   # which is float\n\n  But the problem: the numbers are integers, and the total_sleep_int is an integer, and num_weeks is integer. The division of two integers in Python (if using /) gives a float.\n\n  And the maximum total_sleep_int is 4e15, which is within the range of exact representation for floats (since 4e15 < 2^53).\n\n  So we can do:\n\n      total_sleep = 0   # as integer\n\n  But then we are adding integers, so no problem.\n\n  Let me update the code to use integer for total_sleep.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      n, k = map(int, input().split())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n      # Build prefix sum array of integers\n      pref = [0]*(n+1)\n      for i in range(1, n+1):\n          pref[i] = pref[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n      num_weeks = n - k + 1\n      total_sleep = 0   # integer\n      for i in range(num_weeks):\n          total_sleep += pref[i+k] - pref[i]\n\n      average = total_sleep / num_weeks   # now total_sleep and num_weeks are integers, but division returns float\n\n  But wait, the problem constraints: the sleep times are integers, so the total_sleep is integer.\n\n  However, the example: \n      n=3, k=2: total_sleep=18, num_weeks=2 -> 18/2=9.0, which is correct.\n\n  But the third example: total_sleep=202750, num_weeks=7 -> 202750/7 = 28964.2857142857..., which is correct.\n\n  Now, we must output the average with 10 decimal places.\n\n  Let me test with the third example in code.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use:\n\n      print(\"{:.10f}\".format(total_sleep / num_weeks))\n\n  This way, we don't have to store total_sleep as integer and then convert to float for division, but we are doing the division as float from the beginning.\n\n  But the problem is that if we use float(total_sleep) then total_sleep is integer and we can represent it exactly.\n\n  However, the current method (using integer total_sleep and then dividing by integer num_weeks) is safe.\n\n  But note: the problem says the numbers a_i are at least 1 and up to 10^5, and n, k up to 200000.\n\n  The maximum total_sleep is (n-k+1) * (max element * k) but actually the maximum element is 10^5, so maximum week sum is k * 10^5, and then multiplied by (n-k+1) (which is up to 200000) so maximum total_sleep is 200000 * 200000 * 100000 = 4e15, which is 4000000000000000, which is within the range of Python integers and also within the range of exact representation for floats (since 2^53 is about 9e15). So both methods are safe.\n\n  However, to avoid any potential issues with very large numbers (like if we were to use floats for the entire prefix array, then the prefix array itself would have values up to 4e15, which is still representable as float exactly because 4e15 is less than 2^53). But we are using integer for the prefix array, so we are safe.\n\n  But wait, the prefix array: we are building an array of n+1 integers, each being the cumulative sum. The maximum cumulative sum is 200000 * 100000 = 20e9, which is 20000000000, which is less than 2^53, so integers are safe.\n\n  Therefore, we can proceed with integer arithmetic.\n\n  Let me write the code with integer total_sleep.\n\n  Code:\n\n      n, k = map(int, input().split())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n      # Build prefix sum array\n      pref = [0] * (n+1)\n      for i in range(1, n+1):\n          pref[i] = pref[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n      num_weeks = n - k + 1\n      total_sleep = 0\n      for i in range(num_weeks):\n          total_sleep += pref[i+k] - pref[i]\n\n      average = total_sleep / num_weeks\n\n      print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n  Let me run the provided examples.\n\n  Example 1: \n      Input: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\"\n      Output: 9.0000000000\n\n  Example 2:\n      Input: \"1 1\\n10\"\n      Output: 10.0000000000\n\n  Example 3:\n      Input: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n      Output: 28964.2857142857\n\n  But wait, the example output in the problem statement for the third example is '28964.2857142857'. Our output has 10 decimal digits, but the last digit might be rounded.\n\n  How is the rounding done? The formatting rounds to the nearest 10th.\n\n  However, 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857142857... so the 10th decimal digit is 7, and then the next digits are repeating.\n\n  But when we format to 10 decimal places, we take the first 10 digits: 28964.2857142857\n\n  So the code should be correct.\n\n  However, note: the example output in the problem statement for the third example is written as: \n        '28964.2857142857'\n\n  Our formatted string will be exactly that.\n\n  But wait, the problem example input is given as:\n\n        ['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n  and the expected outputs are:\n\n        ['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n  We must output the same.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6.\"\n\n  Our method is exact for the integer part and the fractional part is represented with 10 decimal digits, so the error is below 1e-6.\n\n  Final code:\n\n      n, k = map(int, input().split())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      pref = [0] * (n+1)\n      for i in range(1, n+1):\n          pref[i] = pref[i-1] + a[i-1]\n      num_weeks = n - k + 1\n      total_sleep = 0\n      for i in range(num_weeks):\n          total_sleep += pref[i+k] - pref[i]\n      average = total_sleep / num_weeks\n      print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n  Let me test with the sample inputs.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the input is provided via standard input.\n\n  We assume the input is given in the standard way.\n\n  But wait, what if k==0? The problem says k>=1, so no.\n\n  What if n==0? The problem says n>=k and k>=1, so n>=1.\n\n  We are safe.\n\n  But note: the problem says n and k are integers, and the list has n integers.\n\n  This code should be efficient for n up to 200000.\n\n  However, building the prefix array is O(n) and the loop is O(n). So overall O(n).\n\n  We are good.\n\n  Let me run the provided examples.\n\n  Example 1: \n      Input: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\"\n\n      pref = [0, 3, 7, 14]\n      num_weeks = 3-2+1 = 2\n      i=0: total_sleep += pref[2]-pref[0] = 7\n      i=1: total_sleep += pref[3]-pref[1] = 14-3 = 11\n      total_sleep = 18\n      average = 18/2 = 9.0\n      Format: \"9.0000000000\"\n\n  Example 2: \n      Input: \"1 1\\n10\"\n      pref = [0,10]\n      num_weeks = 1\n      i=0: total_sleep += 10\n      average = 10.0 -> \"10.0000000000\"\n\n  Example 3: \n      Input: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n      We computed total_sleep=202750, num_weeks=7, so average=202750/7=28964.2857142857142857...\n      Format: \"28964.2857142857\"\n\n  But wait, the formatting: \n      \"{:.10f}\" means we output 10 digits after the decimal.\n\n  However, the number 28964.2857142857142857... has an integer part and then 10 fractional digits.\n\n  The formatting will output:\n\n      Before the decimal: 28964\n      After: 10 digits: 2857142857 (but note: the 11th digit is 1, so rounding the 10th digit? Actually, the formatting in Python rounds to the nearest, so:\n\n      The value stored is 28964.2857142857142857...\n\n      When we format to 10 decimal places, we look at the 11th digit to round the 10th.\n\n      The 10th digit is 7, the 11th is 1, so we leave the 10th as 7.\n\n      So the output is 28964.2857142857.\n\n  Therefore, we are good.\n\n  However, note: there is a possibility to use a different approach without building the entire prefix array, but the problem is solved.\n\n  But wait, there is a known trick: we can use a sliding window to avoid building the prefix array and then iterating? \n\n  Actually, we can use a single pass to compute the total_sleep:\n\n      total_sleep = 0\n      current_sum = sum(a[0:k])   # first window\n      total_sleep += current_sum\n      Then for i in range(1, n-k+1):\n          current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n          total_sleep += current_sum\n\n  This is also O(n) and avoids building the prefix array.\n\n  Which one is faster? The first method builds an array of n+1 integers (memory O(n)), the second method uses O(1) extra memory (apart from the input list).\n\n  Since n can be 200000, building an array of 200001 integers is acceptable, but if memory is a concern, we can use the sliding window.\n\n  But the problem doesn't specify memory limits, and 200001 integers is about 1.6 MB (each integer in Python might be 24-28 bytes, so 200001*24 = 4.8e6 bytes ~ 4.8 MB). That's acceptable.\n\n  However, let's write the sliding window version for practice.\n\n  Steps for sliding window:\n\n      Read n, k and list a.\n\n      If k==0: then no week? but k>=1, so skip.\n\n      Compute the first window: \n          window_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n          total_sleep = window_sum\n\n      Then for i from 1 to n-k (inclusive) [i.e., from 1 to n-k]:\n          window_sum = window_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n          total_sleep += window_sum\n\n      Then average = total_sleep / (n-k+1)\n\n  Example 1: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n      window_sum0 = 3+4 = 7\n      Then i=1: window_sum = 7 - a[0] + a[2] = 7-3+7 = 11\n      total_sleep = 7+11 = 18\n\n  Example 2: n=1, k=1, a=[10]\n      window_sum0 = 10\n      Then i from 1 to 0 (since n-k=0, so no loop) -> total_sleep=10\n\n  Example 3: n=8, k=2, a=[1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n      window_sum0 = 1+2 = 3\n      i=1: window_sum = 3 - a[0] + a[2] = 3-1+4 = 6\n      i=2: window_sum = 6 - a[1] + a[3] = 6-2+100000 = 100004\n      i=3: window_sum = 100004 - a[2] + a[4] = 100004-4+123 = 100123\n      i=4: window_sum = 100123 - a[3] + a[5] = 100123-100000+123 = 579+123? Actually: 100123-100000=123, then +123 -> 246? Wait, let me recalc:\n\n          Correction: \n            i=3: window_sum = 100004 - 4 + 123 -> 100004-4=100000, then 100000+123=100123? \n            Then i=4: window_sum = 100123 - 100000 + 123? \n            Actually, the array a: \n                a[0]=1, a[1]=2, a[2]=4, a[3]=100000, a[4]=123, a[5]=456, a[6]=789, a[7]=1.\n\n            At i=4, we remove a[3] (which is 100000) and add a[5] (which is 456). \n            So: 100123 - 100000 + 456 = 123 + 456 = 579.\n\n          Then i=5: window_sum = 579 - a[4] + a[6] = 579 - 123 + 789 = 456 + 789 = 1245\n          Then i=6: window_sum = 1245 - a[5] + a[7] = 1245 - 456 + 1 = 789 + 1 = 790\n\n          total_sleep = 3 + 6 + 100004 + 100123 + 579 + 1245 + 790 = 202750\n\n  So the sliding window method works.\n\n  Now, which method to choose? Both are O(n). The sliding window uses less memory (O(1) extra space) and is simpler.\n\n  But note: the initial window sum for k consecutive elements: if k is large, then the first window sum takes O(k) time. Then the rest is O(1) per window.\n\n  The total time is O(n) because the first window is O(k) and then we do (n-k) steps of O(1). But note: the entire algorithm is O(n) since k<=n.\n\n  However, the first method (prefix sum) is also O(n). \n\n  But the sliding window method might be faster in practice because we avoid the prefix array and the memory allocation.\n\n  Let me write the sliding window version.\n\n  Code for sliding window:\n\n      n, k = map(int, input().split())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n      # If k==0, but k>=1, so skip.\n      if k == 0:\n          # But the problem says k>=1, so we can ignore.\n          print(0.0)\n          exit(0)\n\n      # Compute the first window\n      window_sum = sum(a[:k])\n      total_sleep = window_sum\n\n      # The number of windows is n-k+1, so we have already computed the first one, then we need to slide from i=1 to i=n-k (inclusive)\n      for i in range(1, n - k + 1):\n          # Remove the element that is leaving the window: a[i-1]\n          # Add the new element: a[i+k-1]\n          window_sum = window_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n          total_sleep += window_sum\n\n      num_weeks = n - k + 1\n      average = total_sleep / num_weeks\n\n      print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n  Let me test with the examples.\n\n  Example 1: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n      window_sum = a[0]+a[1] = 3+4 = 7\n      Then i from 1 to 2 (because n-k+1=2, so the loop runs for i=1 only? Actually, the range is from 1 to n-k (which is 3-2=1) so i=1 only.\n\n      Then: window_sum = 7 - a[0] + a[1+2-1] = 7-3+a[2]=7-3+7=11\n      total_sleep = 7+11=18\n      average=18/2=9.0 -> \"9.0000000000\"\n\n  Example 2: n=1, k=1, a=[10]\n      window_sum = a[0:1] = [10] -> 10\n      Then i from 1 to 0 (because n-k+1=1, so the loop runs from 1 to 0, which is empty)\n      total_sleep=10\n      average=10/1=10.0 -> \"10.0000000000\"\n\n  Example 3: as above.\n\n  This method is correct.\n\n  However, note: the first window is the first k elements, then we slide one by one.\n\n  The indices: \n      Window starting at i=0: covers",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time of Polycarp over all possible weeks in a given sequence of sleep records. A week is defined as k consecutive days, and there are (n - k + 1) such weeks in the sequence. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of sleep times for each week and then finding the average.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires calculating the average sleep time over all possible consecutive k-day periods in a sequence of n days. The challenge is to do this efficiently without recalculating the sum for each week from scratch, which would be too slow for large inputs.\n2. **Intuition**: By using a sliding window technique, we can compute the sum of each subsequent week by adjusting the previous week's sum. This avoids the O(n*k) time complexity of a naive approach.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The sliding window approach involves:\n   - Calculating the sum of the first k elements.\n   - For each subsequent window, subtract the element that exits the window and add the new element entering the window.\n   - Accumulate these sums to get the total sleep time across all weeks.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of days, because each element is processed exactly once (once for the initial window and once for each slide). The space complexity is O(n) to store the input list, but O(1) additional space is used for variables.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    if k == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n        \n    window_sum = sum(a[:k])\n    total_sleep = window_sum\n    \n    for i in range(1, n - k + 1):\n        window_sum = window_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n        total_sleep += window_sum\n        \n    num_weeks = n - k + 1\n    average = total_sleep / num_weeks\n    \n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Initial Setup**: The first window's sum is computed by summing the first k elements of the list.\n3. **Sliding Window**: For each subsequent window, the sum is adjusted by removing the leftmost element of the previous window and adding the new rightmost element. This adjustment allows the sum to be computed in constant time for each window.\n4. **Total Sleep Calculation**: The total sleep time across all windows is accumulated.\n5. **Average Calculation**: The average is computed by dividing the total sleep time by the number of windows (n - k + 1).\n6. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average by leveraging the sliding window technique, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
