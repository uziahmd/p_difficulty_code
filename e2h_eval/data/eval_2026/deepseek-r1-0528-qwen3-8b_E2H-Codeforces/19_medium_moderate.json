The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a tree (n nodes, n-1 edges) and we need to remove k districts such that the remaining districts form a connected subgraph (so the entire remaining set must be connected by the original roads, but note: the removed districts' roads are blocked) and we wish to maximize the total number of fans.\n\n The fan value for district i is 2^i. Note: the base is 2 raised to the power of the district number.\n\n Since 2^i grows exponentially, we would prefer to keep higher-numbered districts and remove lower-numbered ones if possible? But note: we have to keep the graph connected.\n\n However, note that the problem says: the president wants to remove k contestants. So we are going to remove k districts, and we wish the remaining (n-k) districts to form a connected component.\n\n How to think:\n\n We want to maximize the sum of fans. Since 2^i grows very fast, we prefer to keep the districts with higher i (i.e., larger numbers). Therefore, we might want to keep the highest-numbered districts as long as we can form a connected subgraph.\n\n But note: the graph is a tree. In a tree, a connected subgraph is just a set of nodes that forms a subtree (and the induced subgraph is connected). However, the condition is that we must be able to travel from one remaining district to another without crossing a removed district's edge.\n\n Another way: The remaining districts must form a connected subgraph. This means that the induced subgraph must be connected. In a tree, the connected subgraph is simply the union of some paths.\n\n Observation: In a tree, if we choose a set of nodes, they are connected if and only if the set is a union of a connected set (which in a tree is a set of nodes that lie in a single path? Actually no, it's more general: the set must be connected in the tree).\n\n However, note that we are allowed to remove any k nodes arbitrarily. But the constraint is that the remaining nodes must form a connected component.\n\n Since we want to maximize the sum, we want to keep the largest (largest i) nodes. But we cannot arbitrarily keep any set because connectivity matters.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n Let S be the set of remaining districts. Then S must be connected. We wish to maximize the sum of 2^i for i in S.\n\n Since the exponential weights are so high, we would prefer to have the largest i in S. So perhaps we want to keep the largest (n-k) districts? But is that always possible?\n\n Example: In the first sample, n=6, k=3, so we keep 3 districts. The largest three by fan value are [6,5,4] (since 2^6 > 2^5 > 2^4). But wait: 2^6=64, 2^5=32, 2^4=16, then 2^3=8, etc. But note: the example output removes districts 1,3,4 and keeps 2,5,6. The kept set is {2,5,6}. Why is {4,5,6} not chosen? Because if we keep {4,5,6}, then we must check connectivity. In the input:\n\n  6 3\n  2 1\n  2 6\n  4 2\n  5 6\n  2 3\n\n The graph is:\n   1 - 2 - 6 - 5\n        |\n        4\n        |\n        2 is connected to 1, 3, 4, 6.\n\n But note: the node 2 is connected to 4 and 6, and 6 is connected to 5. So {4,5,6} is connected? \n   From 4: to 2 (edge exists), then from 2 to 6 (edge exists), then from 6 to 5 (edge exists). So yes, {4,5,6} is connected.\n\n However, the example output is {2,5,6} (with total fans 2^2+2^5+2^6 = 4+32+64=100) and the kept set {4,5,6} has total fans 16+32+64=112, which is even bigger.\n\n Why does the example output remove 1,3,4 then? The example says the maximum total is 100, but 112 is greater. There must be a misunderstanding.\n\n Wait, the example input says: \n   \"The next n-1 lines each contains two integers a and b\"\n\n And the example input is:\n\n   6 3\n   2 1\n   2 6\n   4 2\n   5 6\n   2 3\n\n But note: the example output is '1 3 4'\n\n And the example says: \"We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\"\n\n Then the kept set is {2,5,6} and total fans 100.\n\n However, if we remove only 1,3,4, then the kept set is {2,5,6} and the graph remains connected because:\n\n   Original edges: \n      2-1 (removed 1, so this edge is blocked at district 1, but note: the problem says the removed districts will block crossing through their districts. So we cannot use edges incident to removed districts? \n\n But wait, the problem states: \"the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts.\" \n\n This means that when we remove a set of districts, we remove all edges incident to those districts. So the remaining graph is the original graph without the nodes (and their incident edges) of the removed districts.\n\n In the example, if we remove {1,3,4}, then we remove the edges:\n   - 2-1 (because 1 is removed)\n   - 4-2 (because 4 is removed)\n   - 2-3 (because 3 is removed)\n\n Then the remaining graph has nodes {2,5,6}. The edges left are:\n   - 2-6 (from the original edge list: the edge between 2 and 6 is still there because both endpoints are kept? But wait: the definition is that you cannot cross the removed districts. So we cannot use any edge that goes through a removed district. However, note that the edges are defined by the original connections. In the remaining graph, we keep an edge only if both endpoints are present.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"each district has exactly one path connecting it to every other district\" meaning the original graph is a tree. After removal, the remaining nodes form a forest. But the condition is that the remaining contestants (districts) must be reachable from one another. So the remaining set must form a connected component (in the forest, we require one connected component).\n\n Therefore, the remaining set must be connected in the original graph after removing the removed nodes and their incident edges.\n\n So in the example, if we remove {1,3,4}, then the remaining set {2,5,6} must be connected. The edges that remain are:\n   - The edge between 2 and 6: because 2 and 6 are present.\n   - The edge between 5 and 6: because 5 and 6 are present.\n\n But what about the edge from 2 to 5? There is no direct edge from 2 to 5. However, there is a path: 2-6-5. But note: we removed the edge 4-2 (because 4 is removed) and also 2-1 and 2-3, but that doesn't break the 2-6-5 path.\n\n Now, what about keeping {4,5,6}? Then we remove {1,2,3}. Then the edges:\n   - The edge 2-6: 2 is removed -> so this edge is gone.\n   - The edge 5-6: both present -> remains.\n   - The edge 4-2: 2 is removed -> gone.\n\n Then the remaining set {4,5,6}: \n   Node 4 is only connected via edge 4-2 (which is gone) and node 2 is gone. So node 4 is isolated. Therefore, {4,5,6} is not connected.\n\n Alternatively, if we remove {1,2,3} then the remaining set is {4,5,6}. The edges that remain: \n   - 4-2: gone (because 2 is removed)\n   - 5-6: present (both kept) -> so we have an edge between 5 and 6, but no edge to 4. So 4 is disconnected.\n\n Hence, we cannot keep {4,5,6} because 4 becomes disconnected.\n\n So the goal is to remove k districts such that the remaining set is connected and the total fan value (sum of 2^i for kept districts) is maximized.\n\n Approach:\n\n We wish to maximize the sum. Since the exponential function is increasing, we prefer higher-indexed nodes. However, sometimes we have to remove a high-indexed node to connect the rest? \n\n But note: if we remove a high-indexed node, we lose its contribution, but we might keep more low-indexed nodes? However, the exponential growth is so large that we would rather keep a high-indexed node than a low-indexed one.\n\n However, the connectivity constraint might force us to remove some high-indexed nodes? Actually, we can rephrase: we wish to keep a connected set of n-k nodes that maximizes the sum of 2^i.\n\n Since 2^i is increasing with i, the best set (without connectivity) would be the n-k largest nodes (by index). But we have to check if these n-k largest nodes form a connected subgraph. If not, we need to adjust.\n\n However, note that the graph is a tree. The largest n-k nodes might not be connected. Then we might need to replace some of the smaller nodes (with lower fan value) with a node that connects the disconnected components.\n\n But note: the problem requires that the entire set is connected. So we are looking for a connected subgraph of n-k nodes with the maximum total fan value.\n\n However, n and k can be up to 10^6, so we need an efficient solution.\n\n Observation: In a tree, the connected subgraphs are trees themselves. We are going to remove k nodes. The remaining n-k nodes must form a connected subgraph.\n\n We can think of the following: \n\n Let T be the original tree. We wish to select a connected subgraph (a subtree) of n-k nodes. How do we maximize the sum of 2^i?\n\n Since 2^i is so high, we want to include as many high-indexed nodes as possible.\n\n Alternative approach: consider that we are forced to keep a set of nodes that form a connected subgraph. We can use the idea of \"pruning\" the smallest (by fan value) nodes from the entire set until we have only n-k nodes, but ensuring connectivity.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to remove any k nodes arbitrarily. We are not required to remove contiguous ones.\n\n We can consider: start with all n nodes, then remove k nodes. But we must maintain connectivity.\n\n We wish to maximize the sum, so we want to remove the least valuable nodes (the ones with small 2^i). But note: if we remove a small node, we might break the connectivity and force us to remove more (or larger) nodes to keep the set connected.\n\n Another idea: since the fan value is 2^i, and the indices are from 1 to n, we can sort the districts by the fan value (which is by i, so naturally increasing with i). But note: we want to keep the large i, so we can try to keep the top (n-k) largest i. However, if that set is not connected, we have to modify.\n\n How to check if a set of nodes (the top n-k by index) is connected? \n\n Since the graph is a tree, we can check the connectivity of the set by seeing if the induced subgraph is connected. But note: the induced subgraph of a tree on a set of nodes is connected if and only if the set of nodes forms a connected subtree (i.e., the minimal subtree that spans these nodes is entirely contained in the set).\n\n We can do:\n\n   Step 1: Identify the set of candidate nodes: the n-k largest indices.\n\n   Step 2: Check if this set is connected. If yes, then we are done (remove the smallest k indices).\n\n   Step 3: If not, we must expand the set to include some nodes that are necessary to connect the components, and then remove the smallest node (by fan value, i.e., smallest index) that is not in the expanded set.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to remove any k nodes, so we are not restricted to only removing the smallest indices. But our goal is to maximize the sum, so we want to keep the largest indices. Therefore, we want to remove the smallest indices (because 2^i is larger for larger i, so we don't want to remove them). But if the set of the top n-k largest indices is not connected, then we might have to remove a larger index (thus losing more fan value) and add a smaller index (thus gaining less) to fix the connectivity.\n\n Actually, let me clarify:\n\n   We wish to maximize the sum. So we start with the set of the largest n-k indices. Then, if that set is not connected, we have to break the set and replace some of the nodes (which we remove) to include some smaller nodes that are necessary for connectivity.\n\n But note: we are removing k nodes. The set of kept nodes must be connected. The idea is:\n\n   We are going to remove k nodes. The best set without connectivity is the n-k largest indices. Now, if that set is connected, we remove the smallest k indices (the complement). Otherwise, we must remove fewer of the smallest indices and more of the larger indices, and then add some of the smaller indices to fix connectivity.\n\n However, note: the set of the n-k largest indices is the same as the set of all nodes except the k smallest. So we can think of:\n\n   Let S = set of nodes from (n-k+1) to n (if we index from 1 to n, then the largest n-k are the last n-k in sorted order by index? Actually, the index i from 1 to n, and the fan value is 2^i, so node n has the largest fan value, node 1 the smallest.\n\n   Then, we wish to remove the k smallest nodes (indices 1 to k) and keep the rest (n-k nodes). But if that set (n-k nodes) is connected, then we are done.\n\n   If not, we have to fix the connectivity by including some of the removed nodes (the small ones) and excluding some of the kept nodes (the large ones). However, note: we cannot change the number of kept nodes (we must keep exactly n-k). So if we remove a small node (say x) then we must remove a large node (say y) to keep the total count at n-k.\n\n   But which ones to swap? We wish to minimize the loss (maximize the sum). The loss of swapping a large node y (with value 2^y) for a small node x (with value 2^x) is 2^y - 2^x. We want to minimize this loss.\n\n   However, note: we are starting with the set of the largest n-k. Then we have to fix the connectivity by swapping some nodes. But how to determine which large node to remove and which small node to add?\n\n Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n   We are going to remove k nodes. We wish the remaining set to be connected and have maximum sum.\n\n   Since the sum is dominated by the high-indexed nodes, we can use a greedy removal of the smallest nodes until the remaining set is connected. However, removing a node might break the graph into multiple components, but note we are starting from all nodes and removing k, so we are building the set from the top down.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Option 1: Start with all nodes. Then remove the smallest node (index 1) and check if the remaining graph is connected. If not, remove the next smallest, etc. until we have removed k nodes and the graph is connected.\n\n   But note: we are required to remove exactly k. And we want the remaining set to be connected.\n\n   However, the problem does not require to remove the smallest k, but we are trying to maximize the sum. Removing a small node (low fan value) is good because we keep the high fan value ones. But if we remove too many small nodes, the graph might become disconnected.\n\n   We want the maximum sum, so we want to keep as many high nodes as possible.\n\n   Algorithm:\n\n   Let T be the tree. We are going to remove k nodes. We wish to maximize the sum of the kept nodes.\n\n   We can use a two-step process:\n\n   Step 1: Consider the set of nodes that we wish to keep. We wish to keep the largest n-k nodes. But if that set is connected, we are done.\n\n   Step 2: If not, we must break the set and fix the connectivity by swapping some nodes. Specifically, we may need to include some of the smaller nodes (which have lower fan value) to connect the components of the set of the largest n-k nodes.\n\n   However, note: the set of the largest n-k nodes is the entire graph without the k smallest nodes. The connectivity of the set of the largest n-k nodes is equivalent to the entire graph having the k smallest nodes removed and the remaining graph being connected.\n\n   We can compute the connectivity of the set of the largest n-k nodes by:\n\n        - Marking nodes from (n-k+1) to n as kept, and nodes 1 to k as removed.\n        - Then, the remaining graph is the original graph without the k smallest nodes.\n\n   But note: the original graph is a tree. Removing k nodes from a tree breaks the tree into several components. We want to know if the kept set is connected.\n\n   How to check? We can do a DFS/BFS in the kept set? But n can be 10^6, and k up to 10^6, so we cannot mark the entire graph and run BFS if we have to do it for each candidate set.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n        Let S = {n-k+1, n-k+2, ..., n} (the largest n-k nodes).\n\n        The induced subgraph on S is connected if and only if the smallest node in S (which is n-k+1) is connected to all the others without passing through any node outside S.\n\n        But note: the entire graph is a tree. The set S is connected if and only if the minimal subtree that connects all the nodes in S is entirely contained in S.\n\n        How to compute the minimal subtree for S? \n\n        The minimal subtree for S is the union of all simple paths between every pair of nodes in S. In a tree, the minimal subtree is the union of all paths between the nodes in S, and it is unique.\n\n        We can compute the diameter of S? Actually, we can find the minimal subtree by finding the two nodes in S that are the farthest apart (the diameter of S) and then including all nodes along the path between them. Then, we must check that every node in S lies on this path or is adjacent to the path? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the concept of Steiner nodes: the minimal subtree is the union of the simple paths between every two leaves? Actually, the minimal subtree is the union of the simple paths between every two nodes? No, we can use the fact that the minimal subtree is the union of the simple paths between the nodes in S, and the set of nodes that are included are the nodes that lie on any of these paths.\n\n        But note: we can compute the minimal subtree for S by:\n\n            - Let u and v be two nodes in S such that the distance between u and v is maximum (diameter of S).\n            - Then the minimal subtree is the path between u and v, and any node in S that is not on this path must be attached to the path? Actually, no: the minimal subtree is the smallest connected subgraph that contains S. It is the union of all the simple paths between every pair of nodes in S.\n\n        However, there is a simpler way: \n\n            In a tree, the minimal subtree spanning S is the union of all the simple paths between every pair of nodes in S. It is also the set of all nodes that lie on the simple paths between the nodes in S.\n\n        We can compute the minimal subtree by:\n\n            - Find the set of nodes that are used to connect S. One way is to consider the set S and then the minimal subtree is the union of the simple paths between the nodes in S. We can find the set by:\n\n                * Remove all edges that are not used to connect two nodes in S? Actually, we can contract the tree or use LCA and then take the union of the paths.\n\n        But note: we are only interested in whether the set S is connected (i.e., the minimal subtree is contained in S). Actually, no: the set S is connected if the minimal subtree (which is the smallest connected subgraph containing S) is entirely contained in S? Not necessarily: the minimal subtree might have nodes not in S. But wait, we are defining the minimal subtree as the smallest connected subgraph that contains S. Then, the minimal subtree is contained in the entire graph. However, we care about the connectivity of S: the set S is connected if the minimal subtree (which is the smallest connected subgraph containing S) is entirely contained in S? Actually, no: the set S is connected if and only if the minimal subtree (which is the smallest connected subgraph containing S) has no node outside S. Because if there is a node outside S in the minimal subtree, then the minimal subtree is not contained in S, and then S is not connected by edges within S.\n\n        Actually, the set S is connected (as a subgraph) if and only if the minimal subtree (the smallest connected subgraph containing S) is exactly the set of edges that are within S? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use a union-find or DFS that only traverses the kept nodes. But the set S has size n-k, which could be large.\n\n   However, note: we are going to have to do this for the initial set and then possibly for several other sets (if we swap). We need an efficient method.\n\n   Another idea: \n\n        We can root the tree arbitrarily (say at node 1) and then do a DFS to compute parent, depth, and the heavy chain.\n\n        Then, for the set S (the largest n-k nodes), we can check if they are connected by:\n\n            - Removing the k smallest nodes, then checking the connectivity of the remaining set.\n\n        But how to check without building the entire graph? We can use the fact that the tree is big.\n\n   We need a better idea.\n\n   Insight: \n\n        In a tree, if we remove k nodes, the remaining set is connected if and only if the removed nodes do not separate the graph into multiple components. \n\n        The set S (the largest n-k nodes) is connected if and only if there is no edge between two nodes in S that is broken by the removal? Actually, no: the set S is connected if the graph induced by S is connected.\n\n        But note: the induced subgraph of a tree on a set S is connected if and only if the entire set S lies within one connected component of the graph obtained by removing the k smallest nodes.\n\n        However, the graph is a tree, so the removal of k nodes breaks the tree into at most k+1 components. The set S is connected if and only if all the nodes in S lie in the same connected component.\n\n        We can precompute the connected components of the graph after removing the k smallest nodes. Then, we can check if all the nodes in S are in one component.\n\n        But note: we are not actually going to remove the k smallest nodes and then check the connectivity of the set S. We need to know if the set S (the n-k largest nodes) is connected.\n\n        Steps for checking connectivity of S:\n\n            - Mark all nodes from 1 to k as removed (we are going to remove them).\n            - Then, traverse the tree (avoiding the removed nodes) and see if the entire set S is in one connected component.\n\n        But note: k can be up to 10^6 and n up to 10^6, so we cannot simulate the entire removal.\n\n   Another Insight: \n\n        Since the graph is a tree, we can use the following property: \n\n            The set S (the largest n-k nodes) is connected if and only if the smallest node in S (which is n-k+1) is connected to all other nodes in S without using any node outside S.\n\n        But wait, we can use the entire graph and the set S. We can consider the following: \n\n            Let u be the smallest node in S (n-k+1). Then, we can consider the maximal connected component containing u. Then, we check if this component contains all nodes in S.\n\n        How to compute the connected component of u after removing nodes 1..k? \n\n        We can do a BFS/DFS starting from u, but skipping nodes < n-k+1 (i.e., the removed nodes). But the graph is large.\n\n        However, note: the removed nodes are the smallest k nodes. We can precompute the graph and then use a multi-source BFS from the kept nodes? Actually, we want to avoid the removed nodes.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a union-find or DSU? But we are removing nodes.\n\n        We can use a technique called \"core decomposition\" or \"trimming\", but that might be overkill.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following: \n\n        We know the entire tree. We can compute the Euler Tour and then use a segment tree to quickly find the connectivity? \n\n        Or we can use the fact that the tree is static and the removed nodes are the smallest k. We can consider the following:\n\n            We wish to know the connectivity of the set S = {n-k+1, n-k+2, ..., n}. \n\n            We can compute the minimal subtree for S by considering the following:\n\n                Let A be the set of removed nodes (smallest k). Then the set S is connected if and only if the entire set S lies in one connected component of the graph after removing A.\n\n            How to compute the connected component of a particular node (say n-k+1) in the graph after removing A? \n\n            We can use a BFS that skips nodes <= k (since we are indexing from 1, and the removed nodes are 1..k). But k and n-k+1 can be arbitrary.\n\n        However, worst-case k is 10^6 and the tree has 10^6 nodes, so BFS/DFS might be acceptable if we do it once? But the problem says we might have to do swaps until the set is connected.\n\n   But wait, we are not limited to just one swap. We might have to do multiple swaps. However, note: the initial set S (largest n-k) might be disconnected into several components. Then, we have to connect them by including some of the removed nodes (the smallest) and removing some of the kept nodes (the largest). \n\n   However, the problem requires to remove exactly k nodes, so if we swap a small node (value 2^x) for a large node (value 2^y), then the net change in the total fan value is -(2^y - 2^x). We wish to minimize the loss (maximize the sum) so we want to swap the largest node (highest fan value) for the smallest node (lowest fan value) that is necessary to connect the components.\n\n   But note: we are not forced to swap only one node. We might have to swap several. \n\n   Steps:\n\n     1. Start with the set S0 = {n-k+1, n-k+2, ..., n}. Check if S0 is connected (without using removed nodes). \n        If yes, then we remove the nodes {1, 2, ..., k} and output them.\n\n     2. If not, then we need to fix the connectivity. We break S0 into several connected components. Then, we wish to connect these components by including some of the removed nodes (the smallest ones) and excluding some of the nodes in S0 (the largest ones). \n\n        However, note: we are allowed to remove exactly k nodes. Initially, we have removed k nodes (the smallest). Now, we want to keep more than n-k nodes? No, we must keep exactly n-k nodes. \n\n        Actually, we started by keeping the largest n-k nodes (and removing the smallest k). Now, if that set is not connected, we must swap some nodes: remove a node from S0 and add a node from the removed set (which is {1,...,k}) but note that the removed set is the smallest k nodes, and we are allowed to remove exactly k, so if we swap one node, then we are still removing k nodes.\n\n        However, we cannot arbitrarily swap because we are constrained by connectivity.\n\n        We wish to minimize the loss (maximize the sum). The loss of swapping a node y (from S0) with a node x (from the removed set) is 2^y - 2^x.\n\n        We need to find a set of swaps (possibly more than one) such that the kept set (which is (S0 \\ {y1, y2, ...}) ∪ {x1, x2, ...}) is connected and the total loss is minimized.\n\n        This is complex.\n\n   Alternative approach: \n\n        We wish to keep a connected set of n-k nodes with maximum sum. \n\n        We can use a greedy algorithm that starts with the entire set and repeatedly remove the smallest node (by fan value, i.e., the smallest index) such that the graph remains connected, until we have removed k nodes.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Let R be the set of removed nodes, initially empty.\n\n            We have a graph G (the entire tree).\n\n            We wish to remove k nodes. We can only remove a node if after removal the graph remains connected? Actually, we must end up with a connected graph.\n\n            However, we are allowed to remove any k nodes arbitrarily. But the goal is to maximize the sum, so we want to remove the smallest nodes (lowest fan value) first.\n\n            Algorithm:\n\n                Sort the nodes by fan value (i.e., by index, since 2^i increases with i) in increasing order: so node 1 has the smallest fan value, node n the largest.\n\n                We are going to remove the smallest k nodes? Not necessarily, because sometimes we cannot remove a small node without breaking connectivity.\n\n                Instead, we can use a strategy:\n\n                    Let T be the entire graph.\n\n                    We wish to keep a connected subgraph of n-k nodes.\n\n                    We start with the entire graph (all n nodes) and remove k nodes one by one. At each step, we remove a node that is not a cut-vertex of the current graph and that is not needed to keep the graph connected? But note: we want to maximize the sum, so we want to remove the smallest fan-value node that is removable without disconnecting the graph.\n\n                Steps:\n\n                    Step 1: Compute the set of nodes that, if removed, would disconnect the graph (the cut vertices). But note: in a tree, removing a leaf never disconnects the graph.\n\n                    Step 2: We can remove leaves (nodes of degree 1) that are not needed for connectivity. But we want to remove the smallest fan-value node (i.e., the smallest index) first.\n\n                    We can do:\n\n                        While we have removed less than k nodes and the graph is connected:\n\n                            Find a leaf (degree 1) in the current graph. Among all leaves, choose the one with the smallest fan value (smallest index).\n\n                            Remove it and update the graph.\n\n                    Then, we have removed some leaves. But what if there are no leaves? Then we must remove a non-leaf. But note: in a tree, if there are no leaves, then the tree must be a single node (but n>=2). Actually, we can also consider: if the graph is not a tree anymore (after removals) then we can still remove leaves.\n\n                    However, after removal, the graph is a forest. We can continue removing leaves (until we have removed k nodes or until the graph becomes disconnected).\n\n                But note: we must ensure that the final graph has exactly n-k nodes and is connected.\n\n                However, if we remove k nodes by always removing a leaf with the smallest fan value, we might end up with a graph that is connected or not.\n\n                Example: \n\n                    n=3, k=1: nodes 1,2,3; edges 1-2, 2-3.\n\n                    The leaves are nodes 1 and 3.\n\n                    We remove node 1 (smallest index). Then the remaining graph is nodes {2,3} and edge 2-3 -> connected.\n\n                    But what if we remove node 3? Then we remove node 3 (which is larger) and then the graph is connected too.\n\n                    But our algorithm would remove node 1 because it is the smallest.\n\n                    Now, what if we have a star graph? \n\n                    Example: n=4, k=1, with edges: 1-2, 1-3, 1-4.\n\n                    Leaves are 2,3,4. We remove the smallest leaf, say node 2. Then the graph becomes: nodes 1,3,4 with edges 1-3,1-4 -> connected.\n\n                    But what if we have a more complex tree?\n\n                However, note: we want to maximize the sum, so we want to remove the smallest fan-value nodes. And the above algorithm removes the smallest leaves first. \n\n                But is it safe to remove a leaf? Removing a leaf never disconnects the graph (in a tree, removing a leaf just shortens the tree). \n\n                Therefore, we can repeatedly remove leaves (choosing the smallest index leaf available) until we have removed k nodes.\n\n                Then, the remaining set is connected (because we never removed a node that disconnects the graph) and we have removed the smallest possible fan-value nodes.\n\n                Why is the remaining set connected? \n\n                    We start with a connected graph (the tree). Removing a leaf does not disconnect the graph. We remove k leaves, so the remaining graph is still connected.\n\n                But wait: what if the graph becomes disconnected during removal? \n\n                    In a tree, removing leaves one by one will eventually lead to a connected graph? Actually, no: removing leaves might leave a connected graph. However, if we remove a leaf, the graph remains connected.\n\n                However, consider a tree with a bridge: \n\n                    Example: n=4, k=1, with edges: 1-2, 2-3, 2-4.\n\n                    Leaves are 1,3,4. We remove node 1 (smallest). Then the graph is still connected.\n\n                But note: we are not required to remove only leaves. What if there are no leaves? \n\n                    In a tree, if there are no leaves, then the tree must be a single node. But n>=2. Actually, after removing some nodes, the graph might become a cycle? No, we started with a tree and we remove leaves, so the graph remains a forest of trees.\n\n                Therefore, we can do:\n\n                    Step 1: Mark all nodes.\n                    Step 2: Build the graph (adjacency list) and compute the degree of each node.\n\n                    Step 3: Use a priority queue (min-heap) for leaves (nodes with degree 1). But we want to remove the smallest index leaf first.\n\n                    However, after removal, the degrees of neighbors change. We must update.\n\n                Steps:\n\n                    We'll use a min-heap (priority queue) for the leaves. But note: we want to remove the smallest index leaf, but we also have to update the degrees.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can use a deque and do:\n\n                      while we haven't removed k nodes:\n                          choose the smallest index node that is a leaf (degree 1) and remove it.\n\n                    Then, for each neighbor, reduce its degree by one, and if that neighbor becomes a leaf (degree 1), push it into the heap.\n\n                    But note: we must avoid removing a node that is already removed.\n\n                However, we are removing k nodes. We want to remove the smallest index leaf available at each step.\n\n                Example: \n\n                    Input: ['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3']\n\n                    We have nodes 1 to 6.\n\n                    The leaves initially: \n                      node 1: connected to 2 -> degree 1\n                      node 3: connected to 2 -> degree 1\n                      node 4: connected to 2 -> degree 1\n                      node 5: connected to 6 -> degree 1\n                      node 2: connected to 1,3,4,5,6 -> degree 5\n                      node 6: connected to 2,5 -> degree 2\n\n                    Leaves: 1,3,4,5.\n\n                    We remove the smallest leaf: node 1.\n\n                    Then update: node 2's degree becomes 4, node 1 is removed.\n\n                    Then the next smallest leaf: node 3 (index 3) or node 4 (index 4) or node 5 (index 5)? We remove node 3.\n\n                    Then update: node 2's degree becomes 3.\n\n                    Then the next smallest leaf: node 4 (index 4) or node 5 (index 5)? We remove node 4.\n\n                    Then update: node 2's degree becomes 2, node 4 is removed.\n\n                    Now, we have removed 3 nodes: 1,3,4.\n\n                    The remaining set is",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected subgraph and the total number of fans from the remaining districts is maximized. The fan value for each district is given by \\(2^i\\), where \\(i\\) is the district number. The key observation here is that higher-numbered districts contribute more to the total fan count due to the exponential nature of \\(2^i\\). Therefore, our goal is to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible while ensuring the remaining districts are connected.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves a tree structure where each node represents a district. Removing a district (node) severs all connections (edges) associated with it. The challenge is to remove exactly k nodes such that the remaining nodes form a connected component and the sum of their fan values is maximized.\n2. **Insight**: Since the fan value increases exponentially with the district number, we prioritize keeping higher-numbered districts. The optimal solution involves keeping the largest (n - k) districts (by district number) if they form a connected subgraph. If not, we need to adjust by removing some high-numbered districts and adding lower-numbered ones to ensure connectivity, but this adjustment should minimize the loss in total fan value.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a greedy approach to remove the smallest (lowest fan value) districts first, ensuring that each removal does not disconnect the graph. Specifically, we repeatedly remove leaves (nodes with only one connection) with the smallest district numbers until k districts are removed. This ensures the remaining graph is connected and consists of the highest possible fan-value districts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    graph = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    index = 2\n    for _ in range(n-1):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        index += 2\n        graph[a].append(b)\n        graph[b].append(a)\n    \n    degree = [0] * (n+1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        degree[i] = len(graph[i])\n    \n    leaves = deque()\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if degree[i] == 1:\n            leaves.append(i)\n            \n    removed = set()\n    count = 0\n    while count < k and leaves:\n        node = leaves.popleft()\n        if node in removed:\n            continue\n        removed.add(node)\n        count += 1\n        \n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            if neighbor not in removed:\n                degree[neighbor] -= 1\n                if degree[neighbor] == 1:\n                    leaves.append(neighbor)\n                    \n    result = sorted(removed)\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of districts (n) and the number of districts to remove (k), followed by the edges connecting the districts.\n2. **Graph Construction**: We build an adjacency list representation of the tree structure using the provided edges.\n3. **Degree Calculation**: For each node, we calculate its degree (number of connections).\n4. **Leaf Identification**: Nodes with degree 1 (leaves) are identified and stored in a queue.\n5. **Greedy Removal**: We remove the smallest numbered leaves first. After each removal, we update the degrees of the neighboring nodes. If a neighbor's degree drops to 1, it is added to the queue for potential removal.\n6. **Output**: The removed districts are sorted and printed in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that the remaining districts form a connected subgraph with the highest possible total fan value by leveraging the properties of trees and a greedy strategy to maximize the sum.",
