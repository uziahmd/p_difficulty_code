    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering that removing one element might help us avoid either the minimum or the maximum value.\n Since the instability is defined as (max - min), we can consider two cases for each element removal:\n   - Removing an element that is the current global minimum, then the new minimum becomes the next smallest element and the maximum remains the same (if the maximum appears at least once).\n   - Similarly, removing an element that is the current global maximum, then the new maximum becomes the next largest element and the minimum remains the same.\n\n However, note that sometimes the array might have duplicates. So we need to consider:\n\n Let's sort the array. Then, if we remove an element, the remaining array's min and max depend on which element we remove.\n\n Observation:\n After sorting, the entire array is in increasing order.\n\n Possibilities:\n 1. Remove the first element (smallest). Then the new array has minimum = a[1] and maximum = a[-1].\n    Instability = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n 2. Remove the last element (largest). Then the new array has minimum = a[0] and maximum = a[-2].\n    Instability = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n But wait, what if we remove an element that is neither the first nor the last? Then the minimum and maximum of the entire array remain the same (if the first and last elements are kept). Therefore, the instability would be the original maximum minus the original minimum.\n\n However, consider: if we remove an element from the middle, the overall min and max don't change because the smallest and largest are still present.\n\n Therefore, the only possibilities for reduction in instability are when we remove either the global minimum or the global maximum.\n\n But note: the array might have multiple occurrences of the minimum and maximum. In that case, even if we remove one occurrence, the next smallest or largest might still be the same as the original?\n\n Actually, if there are multiple minima, then removing one minimum doesn't change the minimum? So the instability would still be the same as the original. Similarly for maxima.\n\n However, the problem says: remove exactly one element.\n\n So the plan:\n  Sort the array.\n\n  Consider three cases:\n    Case 1: Remove the first element -> instability = a[n-1] - a[1]\n    Case 2: Remove the last element -> instability = a[n-2] - a[0]\n    Case 3: Remove an element that is not the first or last, but note that if the entire array is constant (all same) then after removing one, the instability is 0.\n\n  However, wait: if we remove an element that is not the first or last, the overall min and max do not change, so instability = a[-1]-a[0]. But that might not be the best.\n\n  Actually, we must consider that if we remove an element that is not the first or last, the instability might be the same as the original, but we are allowed to remove any one element. Therefore, we can also consider removing an element that is part of the middle, but that doesn't help. So the minimal instability we can get is the minimum among:\n\n    candidate1 = a[-1] - a[1]   (remove the first)\n    candidate2 = a[-2] - a[0]   (remove the last)\n    candidate3 = a[-1] - a[0]   (but this is the original, and we don't want to use this if we can avoid it? Actually, we are forced to remove one element, so if we remove an element that is not the min or max, the instability remains the same. But note: we are trying to minimize. So we can also consider that maybe the original instability is already the minimum? \n\n  However, note: sometimes removing a non-min and non-max element might not help, but if we remove a min or max, we might reduce the instability.\n\n  But actually, the minimal instability we can get is the minimum among candidate1, candidate2, and the original instability? Not exactly.\n\n  Let me clarify:\n\n  Option 1: Remove the first element -> instability = (max of remaining) - (min of remaining) = a[-1] - a[1]\n  Option 2: Remove the last element -> instability = a[-2] - a[0]\n  Option 3: Remove an element that is not the first or last -> then the min and max remain the same, so instability = a[-1] - a[0]\n\n  However, we are allowed to remove any one element. So we can choose the best among these possibilities.\n\n  Therefore, the answer is the minimum between candidate1, candidate2, and the original candidate3? Actually, no: because if we remove an element that is not the first or last, the instability is fixed (the original) and we cannot change it by removing a middle element. But wait, is that always true?\n\n  Example: [1, 3, 5, 7]. \n    Original instability: 6.\n    Remove first: [3,5,7] -> instability 4.\n    Remove last: [1,3,5] -> instability 4.\n    Remove middle: say remove 3 -> [1,5,7] -> instability 6; remove 5 -> [1,3,7] -> instability 6.\n\n  But what if we have duplicates? Example: [1, 2, 2, 3]\n    Original: 3-1 = 2.\n    Remove first: [2,2,3] -> 3-2=1.\n    Remove last: [1,2,2] -> 2-1=1.\n    Remove middle: [1,2,3] -> 3-1=2.\n\n  Another example: [1,1,2,3]\n    Original: 3-1=2.\n    Remove first: [1,2,3] -> 3-1=2.\n    Remove last: [1,1,2] -> 2-1=1.\n\n  So we must consider: the removal of the first element might leave the array with the same minimum if there are duplicates? Actually, no: if we remove the first element and there is another 1, then the next element is 1, so the minimum is still 1. \n\n  Therefore, we need to consider the possibility that there are multiple minima and maxima.\n\n  Revised approach:\n\n  We note that the minimal instability is achieved by either:\n    Removing the smallest element (then the new minimum is the next smallest distinct value, but wait: if there are duplicates, the minimum might not change? Actually, the minimum might change only if the first occurrence is unique. However, the instability is determined by the entire set.\n\n  Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n    Let b = sorted(a)\n\n    Then the instability if we remove an element at index i (0-indexed) is:\n        If i == 0: then the new min is b[1] and max is b[-1] -> instability = b[-1] - b[1]\n        If i == n-1: then the new min is b[0] and max is b[-2] -> instability = b[-2] - b[0]\n        Otherwise: the min is b[0] and max is b[-1] -> instability = b[-1] - b[0]\n\n  But wait, what if we remove an element that is not the first or last, but the element we remove is the only occurrence of the current minimum? Then the new minimum becomes the next element (which is greater than the old minimum). Similarly for maximum.\n\n  However, the above formula for the \"otherwise\" case does not account for the fact that if we remove an element that is the only minimum, then the minimum increases. But note: the array is sorted, and if we remove an element that is the only minimum, then the new minimum is the next element (which is larger). Similarly, if we remove an element that is the only maximum, the new maximum is the previous element (which is smaller).\n\n  However, the \"otherwise\" case above assumed that the min and max remain the same. That is only true if the removed element is not the minimum or maximum. But if we remove an element that is the minimum (even if not the first) or the maximum (even if not the last), then the min or max changes.\n\n  But wait: in the sorted array, the minimum is at the beginning and the maximum at the end. Therefore, if we remove an element that is not the first, then the first element is still the minimum (unless we remove the only occurrence of the minimum). Similarly for maximum.\n\n  Actually, we have to consider the possibility that the removed element might be the only occurrence of the minimum or maximum.\n\n  However, note: the array is sorted. The minimum value is at the start and the maximum at the end. The first occurrence of the minimum is at index0, and the last occurrence of the maximum is at index n-1.\n\n  But if there are duplicates, then the minimum might appear multiple times. Similarly for maximum.\n\n  Therefore, we should consider:\n\n    candidate1: remove the first element -> then the new array's min is the next distinct value? Actually, no: the array is sorted, so the next element (if exists) is the next value. But if the array has duplicates, then the first element is repeated. Then the new min is the same as the old min (because the first element is duplicated). \n\n  Actually, let me think:\n\n    [1,1,2,3] -> remove first 1: becomes [1,2,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> instability=2.\n\n    [1,2,3,3] -> remove last 3: becomes [1,2,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> instability=2.\n\n  How to generalize?\n\n  We can consider: the instability after removing an element depends on the next available minimum and maximum.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  1. Sort the array.\n  2. Consider two pointers: left and right, but we can also consider all contiguous segments of length n-1.\n\n  Alternatively, note that the instability of the entire array without removal is `b[-1] - b[0]`. When we remove one element, the instability is:\n\n      If we remove an element that is not the minimum (i.e., there is at least one other element equal to the minimum) then the minimum remains the same. Similarly for maximum.\n\n  Therefore, we can calculate:\n\n      candidate1: remove the first occurrence of the minimum (if there are duplicates, then removing one minimum doesn't change the min) -> then the new min is the next distinct value? Actually, no: we just remove one occurrence, so the minimum value in the array is still the original minimum (because there's another one). Therefore, the instability becomes (max) - (min) but the min remains the same unless we remove the last occurrence of the minimum.\n\n  This complicates things.\n\n  Let me try a different approach:\n\n  The instability of the array after removing an element x is:\n      instability = max(remaining) - min(remaining)\n\n  But note: the max(remaining) is either the original max (if we didn't remove the max) or the original max if there's another occurrence of the max? Actually, if we remove the last occurrence of the max, then the new max becomes the next lower value.\n\n  Actually, we can consider:\n\n      Let M = original max, m = original min.\n\n      Removing an element x:\n        If x is the only occurrence of M, then the new max is the next largest number (which is the second largest, i.e., the last element before the last one if duplicates? Actually, the array is sorted, so the second largest is the element at index n-2, unless there are duplicates at the end).\n\n  Alternatively, we can consider the following:\n\n      The instability is determined by the min and max of the remaining array.\n\n      We can consider all contiguous segments of length n-1 (but that would be O(n) and n up to 10^5, which is acceptable if we do it smartly, but we can do better).\n\n  Insight:\n\n      The minimal instability is the minimum over i from 0 to n-1 of (max_value_after_removing_i - min_value_after_removing_i).\n\n      And note: \n        The max_value_after_removing_i is:\n            if the element at i is the last occurrence of the maximum? Actually, we don't know the frequency.\n\n  Another idea: the answer must be one of the following:\n\n      candidate1: (b[-1] - b[1])   # remove the first element (which is the smallest) and the new min is b[1]\n      candidate2: (b[-2] - b[0])    # remove the last element (which is the largest) and the new max is b[-2]\n\n      But wait, what if we remove an element that is not the first or last, but is the only occurrence of the minimum or maximum? Then the min or max changes.\n\n  However, note that the array is sorted. The minimum is at the beginning and maximum at the end. Therefore, the only way the min changes is if we remove the first element (and then the next element becomes the min) OR if we remove an element that is the minimum and the only one, then the min becomes the next distinct value (which is the next element, but if there are duplicates, the next element is the same).\n\n  Actually, we can break down the removals:\n\n      Removal of an element at index i (0-indexed):\n\n        Let L = the smallest element in the remaining array.\n        Let R = the largest element in the remaining array.\n\n        Then the instability is R - L.\n\n        We can express:\n\n          If i == 0: then L = b[1] (if n>1, else undefined) and R = b[-1] (if we don't remove the last element) -> wait, actually R is the maximum of the entire array? Only if the last element is not removed. But if we remove the first, the last is still there.\n\n        Actually, for any removal:\n\n          The new min is:\n            if we remove the first element: then the min is b[1] (if n>=2, otherwise the array has one element)\n            if we remove an element that is the only occurrence of the minimum: then the min becomes the next smallest value (which is the first element that is greater than the original min).\n\n          Similarly, the new max is:\n            if we remove the last element: then the max is b[-2]\n            if we remove the only occurrence of the maximum: then the max becomes the previous largest value.\n\n  But note: the array is sorted, so the min is always at the beginning and max at the end until we remove the last occurrence.\n\n  We can precompute:\n\n      The original min = b[0], original max = b[-1].\n\n      Now, if we remove an element, the new min and max are:\n\n          new_min = \n            if we remove the first element: then the next element (if exists) is b[1] (if n>=2). But if n==1, then we don't have to consider (but n>=2 per input).\n            if we remove an element that is not the first, then the min remains b[0] unless every occurrence of b[0] is removed? But we remove only one. So if we remove one occurrence of the minimum, then the min becomes b[0] if there is still at least one b[0] remaining, otherwise the next distinct value.\n\n      Similarly for max.\n\n  However, we can simplify by considering:\n\n      We are allowed to remove exactly one element. Therefore, the new min is either:\n          Option A: The original min, provided that we did not remove the last occurrence of the min.\n          Option B: The next smallest value (which is the first value greater than the original min) if we remove the last occurrence of the min.\n\n      Similarly, the new max is either:\n          Option C: The original max, if we did not remove the last occurrence of the max.\n          Option D: The next largest value (which is the last value less than the original max) if we remove the last occurrence of the max.\n\n  But note: the array is sorted, so:\n\n      The next smallest value after the original min is the first element that is greater than min. In the sorted array, that is b[1] (if there is a duplicate of the min, then b[1] is min, so the next distinct value might be the first element that is not min).\n\n      Actually, the next distinct value for the min is the smallest element that is >= the next element. Similarly for max.\n\n  Alternatively, we can consider the following candidates:\n\n      candidate1: (b[-1] - b[0])   # This is the original, but we are removing one element so we don't have to use this if we can get lower.\n\n      candidate2: (b[-1] - b[1])    # remove the first occurrence (if the first element is unique, then the new min is b[1]; if there are duplicates, then the new min is still b[0] because we removed one occurrence and there's another b[0]? Actually, no: if we remove an element that is the first element (which is b[0]), then the new min is the next distinct value only if the next element is greater than b[0]. But if there are duplicates, then the next element is b[0] again, so the min remains b[0]. \n\n  This leads to:\n\n      Let m0 = b[0], M0 = b[-1]\n\n      We can consider:\n\n        candidate_remove_first = (M0 - (b[1] if b[0] != b[1] else b[0]))   # but wait, if we remove the first element, then the new min is the smallest element in the remaining array. The remaining array has the same min if there is at least one more occurrence of b[0]. How to check? We don't know the frequency.\n\n  We need to know the frequency of the min and max.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      Let freq_min = frequency of b[0] in the entire array.\n      Let freq_max = frequency of b[-1] in the entire array.\n\n      Then:\n\n        If we remove the first element (which is the min) and there is at least one other min (freq_min > 1), then the min remains b[0]. Otherwise, the min becomes b[1].\n\n        Similarly, if we remove the last element (which is the max) and there is at least one other max (freq_max > 1), then the max remains b[-1]. Otherwise, the max becomes b[-2].\n\n      But note: we are allowed to remove any element. So we can remove an element that is not the first or last, but then the min and max remain the same.\n\n      However, we can also remove an element that is somewhere in the middle, and if that element is the only occurrence of the min or the only occurrence of the max, then the min or max changes.\n\n      Actually, the problem requires to remove exactly one element, and we want to minimize the instability.\n\n      Therefore, we can consider:\n\n        candidate1: remove an occurrence of the min (if exists) -> then the new min is:\n            if we remove the last occurrence of the min: then the new min = the next distinct value (which is the first element greater than min, i.e., b[k+1] where k is the last index of min) -> but we don't know k.\n\n      This seems complicated.\n\n  Alternate simpler solution:\n\n      We know that the instability is determined by the min and max of the remaining array.\n\n      We can consider that the remaining array's min is at least the original min and the remaining array's max is at most the original max.\n\n      The minimal instability we can get is the minimum over i of (max_remaining_i - min_remaining_i).\n\n      Notice that the best we can do is to avoid having both the min and max in the remaining array? Actually, we have to remove one element.\n\n      We can also consider: the instability of the remaining array is at least (original_max - original_min) minus something, but we remove one element.\n\n      Actually, we can consider all windows of n-1 consecutive elements? But the array is sorted, so the min and max of a contiguous window is the first and last of that window.\n\n      However, the remaining array is not necessarily contiguous in the sorted array? Actually, we remove one element, so the remaining array is the sorted array without one element. But the min and max of the remaining array are the smallest and largest numbers in the set.\n\n      Therefore, the instability is (max of the set) - (min of the set). \n\n      The set is the entire sorted array without one element.\n\n      The min of the set is:\n          if the removed element is not the original min, then the min remains the original min.\n          else, if the removed element is the original min, then the min becomes the next smallest number (which is the first element that is not the min, but if there are duplicates, then we have to look for the next distinct value).\n\n      Similarly for the max.\n\n      But note: the set is the entire array without one element. Therefore, the min is the smallest element in the set, which is the original min if there's at least one occurrence of the min left, otherwise the next smallest.\n\n      Similarly for the max.\n\n      How to compute the next smallest? We can precompute:\n\n          Let L = list of distinct values and their frequencies.\n\n      However, n can be up to 10^5, and the values up to 10^5, so we can use:\n\n          Let b = sorted(a)\n\n          Then the next distinct value after the min is the smallest value that is greater than b[0]. We can do:\n\n          Let i = 0\n          while i < n and b[i] == b[0]:\n              i += 1\n          Then the next distinct min is b[i] if i < n, else there is none (but n>=2, so we have at least two elements, so i will be at least 1).\n\n      Similarly for max.\n\n      Then, the instability after removing an element x is:\n\n          Let new_min = \n            if x == b[0] and the frequency of b[0] is 1: then next_min = b[i] (where i is the first index where b[i] != b[0])\n            else: b[0]   (if we didn't remove the last occurrence of the min, or if we removed an element that is not the min, then the min remains)\n\n          Similarly, new_max = \n            if x == b[-1] and frequency of b[-1] is 1: then next_max = b[j] (where j is the last index where b[j] != b[-1])\n            else: b[-1]\n\n          Then instability = new_max - new_min\n\n      But wait, we don't know which element we remove. We are allowed to remove any one element.\n\n      We are trying to minimize the instability.\n\n      We can consider two strategies:\n\n        Strategy 1: Remove an element that is the min (if there is more than one occurrence, then the min remains the same, so the instability remains (b[-1] - b[0]). But if there is only one occurrence, then the min increases to the next distinct value, and the max remains the same (unless we also remove the max, but we only remove one) -> then instability = b[-1] - b[i] (where i is the next distinct min).\n\n        Strategy 2: Remove an element that is the max (similarly).\n\n        Strategy 3: Remove an element that is neither the min nor the max. Then the min and max remain the same, so instability = b[-1] - b[0].\n\n      However, note: sometimes removing an element that is not the min or max might not be necessary because we can get a lower instability by removing a min or max.\n\n      Therefore, we can compute:\n\n          candidate1: remove the last occurrence of the min (if exists) -> then the new min is the next distinct value, and the max remains the same (if we don't remove the max) -> instability = b[-1] - (next distinct min)\n\n          candidate2: remove the last occurrence of the max -> instability = (next distinct max) - b[0]\n\n          candidate3: remove an element that is not the min or max -> then instability = b[-1] - b[0]\n\n      But wait, we are allowed to remove any element. We don't necessarily have to remove the last occurrence. We can remove any occurrence. However, if we remove an occurrence of the min that is not the last one, then the min remains the same. Similarly for max.\n\n      Therefore, we can also consider:\n\n          candidate4: remove an element that is the min but not the last occurrence -> then the min remains, so instability = b[-1] - b[0] (same as candidate3) -> so no improvement.\n\n          candidate5: remove an element that is the max but not the last occurrence -> same as candidate3.\n\n      Therefore, the only candidates that can yield a lower instability are:\n\n          candidate1: remove the last occurrence of the min -> then the min increases, and the max remains the same (so instability decreases if the min increased by a significant amount).\n          candidate2: remove the last occurrence of the max -> then the max decreases, and the min remains the same.\n\n      And candidate3: remove an element that is neither min nor max -> then the min and max remain, so instability is the same as the original.\n\n      But note: sometimes the original instability is already the minimum? Actually, no: because if we remove an element that is the min (last occurrence) or the max (last occurrence) we might get a lower instability.\n\n      However, there is a catch: if we remove an element that is not the min or max, the instability remains the same, so if we can get a lower instability by removing the min or max, then we do that. Otherwise, we remove an arbitrary element and the instability remains the same.\n\n      Therefore, the minimal instability is the minimum between:\n\n          candidate1: (b[-1] - next_min)   [where next_min is the next distinct value after the min, if we remove the last occurrence of the min]\n          candidate2: (next_max - b[0])     [where next_max is the next distinct value before the max, if we remove the last occurrence of the max]\n          candidate3: (b[-1] - b[0])        [if we remove an element that is not the min or max, or if we remove a duplicate min or max then the min/max remains the same]\n\n      But wait: if we remove an element that is the min and there are duplicates, then the min remains the same, so the instability remains b[-1]-b[0]. Similarly for max.\n\n      Therefore, the minimal instability we can achieve is:\n\n          min( candidate1, candidate2, b[-1]-b[0] )\n\n      However, we must ensure that candidate1 and candidate2 are computed correctly.\n\n      How to compute next_min and next_max?\n\n          We can do:\n\n          next_min = None\n          i = 0\n          while i < n and b[i] == b[0]:\n              i += 1\n          if i < n:\n              next_min = b[i]\n          else:\n              next_min = b[-1]   # but then there is only one distinct value, so the entire array is the same -> then removing one element, the next_min is the same (since the array is all same) -> but wait, if the entire array is same, then next_min is still b[0] because we are looking for the next distinct value and there isn't one. Actually, if the entire array is same, then we set next_min = b[0] (but then we are removing the last occurrence, but if there are multiple, then we set next_min to the same value? Actually, no: if the entire array is same, then the next distinct value does not exist, so we don't change the min.\n\n          Similarly, for next_max:\n\n          j = n-1\n          while j>=0 and b[j]==b[-1]:\n              j -= 1\n          if j>=0:\n              next_max = b[j]\n          else:\n              next_max = b[0]\n\n      But wait, in the case of all same, then:\n\n          candidate1: (b[-1] - next_min) = (x - x) = 0.\n          candidate2: (next_max - b[0]) = (x - x) = 0.\n\n      And candidate3: (b[-1]-b[0]) = 0.\n\n      So that works.\n\n      However, note: the array might be [1,1,2,2] (n=4). \n\n        Original instability: 2-1=1.\n\n        Removing the last occurrence of min (the last 1): then the min becomes 1 (because there is still a 1) -> so actually we should not use candidate1 as (b[-1]-next_min) because next_min is 2, but wait: we are removing one occurrence of 1, and there is still a 1. So the condition for candidate1 is: only when we remove the last occurrence of the min, then the min increases. \n\n      Correction: candidate1 is only valid if we remove the last occurrence of the min (so that the min increases). But if we remove an occurrence of the min that is not the last, then the min remains. Similarly for max.\n\n      Therefore, we must consider:\n\n        candidate1: remove the last occurrence of the min -> then the min becomes the next distinct value (if exists) or remains the same if there is no next distinct value (but then the entire array is the same, so next_min is the same? Actually, if the entire array is the same, then there is no distinct value, so the min remains the same). \n\n      Actually, we have to adjust:\n\n        The min after removing the last occurrence of the min is:\n            if there is at least one min left -> then the min is still the same (but wait, we removed the last occurrence, so now there are no min left? No, we remove one occurrence and if there were multiple, then we have at least one left). \n\n      Let me reframe:\n\n        We are removing one occurrence of the min. The new min is:\n            if there is at least one other occurrence of the min -> then the min is still the original min.\n            else (only one occurrence) -> then the min becomes the next distinct value (if exists, else the array becomes empty? but n>=2, so if we remove the only min and the array has more than one element, then there must be a next distinct value or not? Actually, if we remove the only min, then the next smallest value is the next distinct value (if exists) or the array's min becomes larger.\n\n        But wait: if we remove the only min, then the new min is the next distinct value (if exists). If there is no next distinct value (i.e., the array was [min, min] and we remove one, then the remaining array is [min] -> but wait, n>=2, so if we remove one from two identical elements, then the remaining array has one element which is min, so the min is still min. \n\n        Actually, no: the array has two elements: [1,1]. Then we remove one 1, then the remaining array is [1]. Then the min is 1. \n\n        Therefore, the min remains the same even if we remove the last occurrence of the min, if there was more than one occurrence? \n\n        What we really mean by \"last occurrence\" is: we remove one occurrence, and then we check if the min changed. The min changes only if we remove the last occurrence and there are no duplicates. \n\n        Actually, the min changes if and only if we remove the last occurrence of the min and the min was originally the smallest and there were no other min. \n\n        Therefore, the correct condition for candidate1 is:\n\n            candidate1 = (b[-1] - (b[0] if (frequency_min > 1) else next_min))\n\n        But wait, if we remove one occurrence of the min, and there are more min, then the min remains. If we remove the last occurrence of the min, then the min becomes the next distinct value.\n\n        However, we don't know the frequency of the min in the entire array.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Let freq_min = count of b[0] in the array.\n          Let freq_max = count of b[-1] in the array.\n\n          Then:\n\n            candidate1: remove one occurrence of the min (any occurrence, but we are particularly interested in removing the last occurrence to change the min). However, the minimal instability we can get by removing a min is:\n\n                If we remove a min that is not the last occurrence (so there are still mins left) -> then the min remains, so instability = b[-1] - b[0] (if we don't remove the max) OR if we remove a min and the max remains, then it's (b[-1]-b[0]) which is the original.\n\n                But if we remove the last occurrence of the min (meaning we remove all the min) then the min increases.\n\n            However, we are allowed to remove any one element. We can choose to remove the last occurrence of the min to potentially improve the instability.\n\n            Therefore, the best candidate by removing a min is:\n\n                candidate_remove_min = (b[-1] - (b[0] if (freq_min > 1) else next_min))\n\n            Similarly, candidate_remove_max = ( (b[-1] if (freq_max > 1) else next_max) - b[0] )\n\n            And candidate_remove_other = b[-1] - b[0]\n\n          Then the answer is the minimum of candidate_remove_min, candidate_remove_max, candidate_remove_other.\n\n        But wait: what if we remove an element that is the min and the max? Actually, we remove one element. It cannot be both the min and the max unless the entire array is the same.\n\n        Example: [1,1,2,2] (n=4)\n\n          Original: 2-1=1.\n\n          candidate_remove_min: \n            freq_min = 2 (for 1) -> so if we remove one min, the min remains 1 -> candidate_remove_min = 2-1 = 1.\n\n          candidate_remove_max:\n            freq_max = 2 (for 2) -> candidate_remove_max = 2-1 = 1.\n\n          candidate_remove_other: 2-1=1.\n\n          Then the answer is 1.\n\n        Example: [1,2,3,4] (n=4)\n\n          candidate_remove_min: \n            remove the last occurrence of 1 -> then min becomes 2, so candidate_remove_min = 4-2 = 2.\n          candidate_remove_max:\n            remove the last occurrence of 4 -> then max becomes 3, so candidate_remove_max = 3-1 = 2.\n          candidate_remove_other: 4-1=3.\n\n          Then the answer is 2.\n\n        Example: [1,1,1,2] (n=4)\n\n          candidate_remove_min: \n            freq_min=3 -> so min remains 1 -> candidate_remove_min = 2-1 = 1.\n          candidate_remove_max:\n            freq_max=1 -> so max becomes next_max (which is 1) -> candidate_remove_max = 1-1=0.\n          candidate_remove_other: 2-1=1.\n\n          Then the answer is 0.\n\n        Example: [1,1,2,2] (n=4) gives 1, which matches.\n\n        Example: [1,2,2,3] (n=4)\n\n          candidate_remove_min: \n            freq_min=1 -> so min becomes next_min=2 -> candidate_remove_min = 3-2=1.\n          candidate_remove_max:\n            freq_max=2 -> so max remains 3 -> candidate_remove_max = 3-1=2.\n          candidate_remove_other: 3-1=2.\n\n          Then the answer is 1.\n\n        Example: [1,100000] (n=2) -> the example input.\n\n          candidate_remove_min: \n            freq_min=1 -> next_min=100000 -> candidate_remove_min = 100000-100000=0.\n          candidate_remove_max:\n            freq_max=1 -> next_max=1 -> candidate_remove_max = 1-1=0.\n          candidate_remove_other: 100000-1=99999.\n\n          Then the answer is 0.\n\n      Implementation:\n\n        Step 1: Read n and the list a.\n        Step 2: Sort a.\n        Step 3: Count frequency of the first and last elements.\n\n        Step 4: Find next_min and next_max.\n\n          For next_min:\n            i = 0\n            while i < n and a[i] == a[0]:\n                i += 1\n            if i < n:\n                next_min = a[i]\n            else:\n                next_min = a[0]   # meaning no distinct value found, so the entire array is the same.\n\n          For next_max:\n            j = n-1\n            while j >=0 and a[j] == a[-1]:\n                j -= 1\n            if j >=0:\n                next_max = a[j]\n            else:\n                next_max = a[-1]   # but wait, if we remove the last occurrence of the max and there is no next distinct value, then we set to a[-1]? Actually, no: if we remove the last occurrence, then the next_max is the next distinct value or the same if duplicates? Actually, the next_max is the largest value that is strictly less than the original max. But if we remove the last occurrence of the max, then the new max is the next distinct value (which is less than the original max). However, if the entire array is the same, then next_max should",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in efficiently determining the next distinct values for the minimum and maximum elements if they are removed.\n2. **Frequency Calculation**: Calculate the frequency of the first and last elements in the sorted array. This helps in determining whether removing these elements will change the minimum or maximum of the resulting array.\n3. **Next Distinct Values**: Find the next distinct value after the minimum (next_min) and before the maximum (next_max) in the sorted array. These values are crucial if the last occurrence of the minimum or maximum is removed.\n4. **Candidate Instabilities**: Compute three candidate instabilities:\n   - **Removing the Last Occurrence of the Minimum**: The new instability is `max - next_min`.\n   - **Removing the Last Occurrence of the Maximum**: The new instability is `next_max - min`.\n   - **Removing Any Other Element**: The instability remains `max - min`.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The answer is the minimum among the three candidate instabilities.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    \n    freq_min = 0\n    for num in a:\n        if num == a[0]:\n            freq_min += 1\n        else:\n            break\n            \n    freq_max = 0\n    for num in reversed(a):\n        if num == a[-1]:\n            freq_max += 1\n        else:\n            break\n            \n    next_min = a[0]\n    i = 0\n    while i < n and a[i] == a[0]:\n        i += 1\n    if i < n:\n        next_min = a[i]\n        \n    next_max = a[-1]\n    j = n-1\n    while j >= 0 and a[j] == a[-1]:\n        j -= 1\n    if j >= 0:\n        next_max = a[j]\n        \n    candidate_remove_min = a[-1] - next_min if freq_min == 1 else a[-1] - a[0]\n    candidate_remove_max = next_max - a[0] if freq_max == 1 else next_max - a[0] if next_max != a[0] else 0\n    candidate_remove_other = a[-1] - a[0]\n    \n    ans = min(candidate_remove_min, candidate_remove_max, candidate_remove_other)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of elements and the array itself.\n2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the minimum and maximum elements and their frequencies.\n3. **Frequency Calculation**: The frequency of the first and last elements in the sorted array is calculated to determine if removing them will change the minimum or maximum values.\n4. **Next Distinct Values**: The next distinct value after the minimum (next_min) and before the maximum (next_max) is found by scanning the sorted array.\n5. **Candidate Instabilities**: Three scenarios are considered:\n   - **Removing the Minimum**: If the minimum occurs only once, the new minimum becomes next_min; otherwise, it remains the same.\n   - **Removing the Maximum**: If the maximum occurs only once, the new maximum becomes next_max; otherwise, it remains the same.\n   - **Removing Any Other Element**: The instability remains unchanged as the minimum and maximum stay the same.\n6. **Result**: The smallest value among the three candidates is printed as the result, representing the minimal instability achievable by removing one element from the array.",
