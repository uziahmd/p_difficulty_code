He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem:\n\n We are given two tokens in the first line: a and b. \n   - a is an integer base (2 <= a <= 25)\n   - b can be either an integer (same constraints) or the letter 'R'\n\n Then we are given a string c which is a non-negative integer in base a (with possible leading zeros, but length <= 1000). The number is guaranteed to be representable.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Convert the given string c (which is in base a) to an integer in base 10.\n    Since the base a can be up to 25, and the string can have digits and letters (from 'A' onward for digits above 9), note:\n        - Digits in base a: from '0' to '9' and then letters from 'A' to ... until the base-1 digit representation.\n        - However, the problem states that in bases greater than 10, we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\n\n    Example: base 12, the digit for 10 is 'A', 11 is 'B', 12 is not used since base 12 has digits 0-11.\n\n 2. If b is an integer (i.e., not 'R'), then convert the base-10 integer to base b (without leading zeros). The base b is between 2 and 25.\n    - How to convert? \n        We'll repeatedly divide the number by b and map the remainder to the corresponding digit (using digits 0-9 and then letters if necessary).\n\n 3. If b is 'R', then convert the base-10 integer to a Roman numeral.\n\n Important: The input number c in base a might be very large (up to 10^1000 or even more in base 10 representation? Actually, the problem says the number in base a has at most 1000 digits, and base a is at most 25, so the maximum value is (a^(1000)) which is huge). However, note the guarantee for Roman numerals: the number (if Roman) is at most 300010 and not zero. So when we see 'R', we know the base-10 integer is at most 300010 (so we can handle it with standard integers). But for the general case, we must be cautious because the base conversion from base a to base 10 might result in a very big integer (like base 25 with 1000 digits). \n\n However, note the constraint: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510\" — wait, that doesn't make sense because 10^1510 is astronomically huge. Let me re-read: actually, the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510\". But wait, 10^1510 is too big for standard integers. However, the note also says: \"the number won't be greater than 101510\", which is 10^1510? Actually, the example input format includes numbers that are represented in base a (which is at most 25) and the string length is at most 1000. \n\n But wait, the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510.\"\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510.\" — that is 10 raised to the power of 1510. That's a number with 1511 digits. That is too big for standard Python integers (which can be arbitrary precision, but the operations might be slow). However, the problem says \"the number\" (in base 10) is at most 10^1510 for non-Roman cases. \n\n But wait, the input number is given in base a (which is at most 25) and the string has at most 1000 digits. The maximum value in base a (base 25) with 1000 digits is 25^1000, which is much larger than 10^1510 (because 25^1000 = (5^2)^1000 = 5^2000, and 5^2000 is about 1",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, which could either be a standard base or a Roman numeral system. The solution involves three main steps: converting the input number from its given base to a decimal (base 10) number, then converting this decimal number to the desired output base, which could be either a standard base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input String to Decimal**: The input number is given as a string in base `a`. We first convert this string into a decimal (base 10) integer. Each character in the string represents a digit in base `a`, where digits can be numbers (0-9) or letters (A-Z) for values greater than 9.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Output Base**:\n   - **Standard Base**: If the output base `b` is an integer, we convert the decimal number to base `b` by repeatedly dividing the number by `b` and collecting remainders. These remainders are then mapped to their corresponding digits (0-9 and A-Z if necessary).\n   - **Roman Numeral**: If the output base is 'R', we convert the decimal number to Roman numerals. This involves breaking down the number into its constituent values (like thousands, hundreds, tens, and units) and mapping each part to the appropriate Roman numeral symbols.\n3. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the input number is zero or very large, ensuring that leading zeros are omitted in the output.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    a_str = first_line[0]\n    b_str = first_line[1] if len(first_line) > 1 else None\n    \n    num_str = data[1].strip()\n    \n    if a_str == '0' and num_str == '0':\n        print('0')\n        return\n        \n    digits_map = {str(i): i for i in range(10)}\n    for i in range(10, 36):\n        digits_map[chr(ord('A') + i - 10)] = i\n        \n    base_a = int(a_str)\n    base_b_char = b_str\n    \n    def convert_base_a_to_decimal(s, base):\n        value = 0\n        for char in s:\n            if char in digits_map:\n                digit_value = digits_map[char]\n            else:\n                digit_value = digits_map.get(char.upper(), -1)\n                if digit_value == -1:\n                    digit_value = int(char, 36) if char.isdigit() else -1\n            if digit_value < 0 or digit_value >= base:\n                digit_value = base - 1\n            value = value * base + digit_value\n        return value\n\n    try:\n        if base_a == 1:\n            num_dec = 0\n            for char in num_str:\n                num_dec += 1\n        else:\n            num_dec = convert_base_a_to_decimal(num_str, base_a)\n    except Exception as e:\n        num_dec = 0\n\n    if base_b_char == 'R':\n        if num_dec == 0:\n            print('0')\n            return\n            \n        roman_numerals = {\n            1000: 'M',\n            900: 'CM',\n            500: 'D',\n            400: 'CD',\n            100: 'C',\n            90: 'XC',\n            50: 'L',\n            40: 'XL',\n            10: 'X',\n            9: 'IX',\n            5: 'V',\n            4: 'IV',\n            1: 'I'\n        }\n        \n        res = ''\n        for value, numeral in roman_numerals.items():\n            while num_dec >= value:\n                res += numeral\n                num_dec -= value\n                \n        print(res)\n    else:\n        base_b = int(base_b_char)\n        if num_dec == 0:\n            print('0')\n            return\n            \n        digits = []\n        n = num_dec\n        if n == 0:\n            digits.append('0')\n        else:\n            while n:\n                remainder = n % base_b\n                n = n // base_b\n                digits.append(digits_map_inv[remainder])\n                \n        digits.reverse()\n        print(''.join(digits))\n        \nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    digits_map_inv = {i: str(i) for i in range(10)}\n    for i in range(10, 36):\n        digits_map_inv[i] = chr(ord('A') + i - 10)\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains the bases `a` and `b`, where `b` can be 'R' for Roman numerals. The second line contains the number in base `a` as a string.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The input string is converted to a decimal number by processing each character, converting it to its numerical value based on the given base `a`.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target base is 'R', the decimal number is converted to Roman numerals by iteratively subtracting the largest possible Roman numeral values from the number and appending the corresponding symbols to the result.\n4. **Standard Base Conversion**: For standard bases, the decimal number is converted by repeatedly dividing by the target base and collecting remainders, which are then mapped to their respective digits.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed without leading zeros, handling edge cases like zero input appropriately.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both standard base conversions and Roman numeral conversions, ensuring correctness and clarity for all specified inputs.",
