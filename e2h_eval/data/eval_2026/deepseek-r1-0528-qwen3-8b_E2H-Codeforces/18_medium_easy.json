The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\n The frog starts at 0 and can jump either by +a or -b.\n We are to compute, for each i from 0 to m, the function f(i) which is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach (from 0) without leaving [0, i]. Then sum these f(i) for i=0 to m.\n\n However, note: the frog doesn't have to stay within [0, i] during the entire journey? Actually, the problem states: \"if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval [0, x]\". But note: the definition of f(x) is that the frog can reach some integer (and only counts if the frog can somehow reach it) and we consider the set of reachable integers that are in [0, x].\n\n However, note that the frog can start from 0 and then make jumps. The key is that the frog must not land on an integer outside [0, x] (for the entire sequence of jumps that leads to a particular integer). But wait: the problem says \"if it never jumps on an integer outside [0, x]\". So for a given x, we consider all integers that can be reached without ever stepping outside [0, x].\n\n But note: the frog might use multiple trips? Actually, the problem says: \"an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from 0\" and the condition is that the frog never jumps on an integer outside [0, x]. So for a fixed x, we consider all sequences of jumps (each jump being +a or -b) that keep the frog within [0, x]. And then count the distinct integers that appear in such sequences.\n\n However, note: the frog can also stop at any time. So we are counting the set of all positions that can be reached (without violating the [0,x] constraint) starting from 0.\n\n But observe: the frog might overshoot x when trying to reach a position? Actually, the condition is that the frog never jumps on an integer outside [0, x]. So if a jump would lead to a position <0 or >x, then that jump is forbidden.\n\n However, note that the problem defines f(x) as the set of integers the frog can reach (via any sequence of jumps) without ever jumping to a number outside [0,x]. Therefore, for a given x, we are only allowed to use jumps that do not leave [0,x].\n\n Now, note that the frog can jump arbitrarily many times (until it cannot jump further). Also, the frog can jump back and forth, but constrained by the boundaries.\n\n Important: The problem asks for the sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i).\n\n Since m can be up to 10^9, we cannot iterate from 0 to m.\n\n Let's try to understand the set of positions reachable for a fixed x.\n\n Observation:\n The frog can move from 0 by adding a or subtracting b. But the subtraction from 0 is only allowed if 0-b >= 0? Actually, 0-b is negative, so that jump is not allowed (unless b==0, but b>=1). So from 0, the only jump is +a (if we are to stay in [0,x])? However, note: the condition is that the frog never jumps on an integer outside [0,x]. So if x < a, then from 0 we cannot jump to a because a > x. So the frog is stuck at 0.\n\n Similarly, if x >= a, then we can jump to a. Then from a, we can jump to a+a = 2a or a-b (if a-b >=0 and <=x). But note: we cannot jump below 0, so if a-b < 0, then we can't do that.\n\n However, note: the frog can jump backwards (with -b) from a position k only if k-b is between 0 and x. Similarly, forward is always allowed if k+a <= x? Not exactly: we can also use the backward jump to go from a higher position to a lower one, but then we must not exceed x when going forward.\n\n How do we characterize the set of reachable positions for a fixed x?\n\n Let S_x be the set of positions reachable without leaving [0,x]. Then:\n\n 0 is always reachable.\n\n From a position k, we can go to k+a if k+a <= x, and to k-b if k-b >= 0 and k-b<=x.\n\n But note: the frog can make arbitrary sequences. This is a graph with nodes being integers in [0,x] and edges from k to k+a (if k+a<=x) and from k to k-b (if k>=b and k-b>=0). However, we are not required to traverse the entire graph, but to count the distinct integers.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the positions as numbers that are linear combinations of a and b with nonnegative coefficients, but with constraints (modular arithmetic). However, note the operations are not symmetric because we have two different steps (forward by a, backward by b). \n\n Another idea: we can model the positions as:\n\n   Start at 0.\n\n   Then we can add a, then from there we can subtract b (if we have enough a to cover the b's and then some), etc.\n\n But note: the backward jump (subtracting b) is only available if we have at least b in the current position? Actually, no: we can subtract b from any position as long as the result is nonnegative and <=x.\n\n However, the key observation is that the set of reachable positions is the set of numbers of the form:\n\n   n*a - k*b\n\n where n and k are nonnegative integers, and we require that the number is in [0, x] and also that along the way we never left [0,x]. But note: the order matters. However, we can rearrange the operations? Actually, we can think of it as: we must have at least k*b <= n*a (so that we don't go negative) and also the intermediate steps must be within [0,x]. But this is complex.\n\n Alternatively, note that the frog can only reach positions that are congruent to 0 mod g, where g = gcd(a,b)? Actually, let g = gcd(a,b). Then every reachable position must be a multiple of g (if we ignore the boundaries). Why? Because:\n\n   Start at 0 (multiple of g).\n   Jump by a: multiple of g.\n   Jump by -b: multiple of g.\n\n So the entire set of reachable positions (ignoring boundaries) is the set of multiples of g.\n\n However, the boundaries [0,x] and the operations are constrained by the boundaries. But note: even without boundaries, the set of positions is the set of multiples of g? Actually, yes: if we consider the entire real line, then we can reach any multiple of g (if we have enough steps). But with boundaries, we are limited to [0,x].\n\n However, the boundaries might restrict the set. But note: the problem does not require the frog to stay in [0,x] during the entire sequence? Actually, the problem says: \"never jumps on an integer outside [0,x]\". So if we try to jump to a position that is beyond x, we are not allowed. Similarly, negative positions are disallowed.\n\n But note: sometimes we might need to cross the boundaries to get to a desired position? Actually, no: the condition is that we never jump to a number outside [0,x]. So the entire journey must stay in [0,x]. Therefore, the frog cannot use a jump that would take it out.\n\n However, consider: what if we want to reach a position that is a multiple of g, but the minimal representation requires going negative? Then we cannot. Similarly, if we need to go beyond x, we cannot.\n\n But note: the frog can use multiple jumps and the order might matter. However, the set of positions that can be reached without leaving [0,x] is a subset of the multiples of g in [0,x]. But not necessarily all multiples of g in [0,x] are reachable.\n\n Example: a=5, b=3, g=1. Then without boundaries, we can reach any integer. But with boundaries, say x=7, we can reach {0,5,3,6,8?} -> wait, 8 is beyond 7, so we cannot. But let's break down:\n\n   Start at 0.\n\n   From 0: jump to 5 (if x>=5, which it is) -> then from 5: jump to 5+5=10 (which is >7 -> not allowed) or 5-3=2 (which is allowed). Then from 2: 2+5=7 (allowed) or 2-3=-1 (not allowed). Then from 7: 7+5=12 (disallowed) or 7-3=4 (allowed). Then from 4: 4+5=9 (disallowed) or 4-3=1 (allowed). Then from 1: 1+5=6 (allowed) or 1-3=-2 (disallowed). Then from 6: 6+5=11 (disallowed) or 6-3=3 (allowed). Then from 3: 3+5=8 (disallowed) or 3-3=0 (allowed). \n\n So the positions we reached: 0,5,2,7,4,1,6,3. That is 8 distinct positions.\n\n And note: the multiples of 1 in [0,7] are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 -> 8 numbers. So in this case, we reached all multiples of 1 (which is every integer) in [0,7].\n\n Another example: a=2, b=2, then g=2. Without boundaries, we can only reach even numbers. With boundaries [0,3]: \n   Start at 0.\n   From 0: 0+2=2 (allowed) or 0-2=-2 (disallowed). Then from 2: 2+2=4 (disallowed) or 2-2=0 (allowed). \n   So we have {0,2}. The multiples of 2 in [0,3] are {0,2}. So again, we reached all multiples of 2.\n\n Another example: a=2, b=4, g=2. Without boundaries, we can reach any even number. With boundaries [0,5]:\n   Start at 0.\n   From 0: 0+2=2 (allowed) or 0-4=-4 (disallowed). \n   From 2: 2+2=4 (allowed) or 2-4=-2 (disallowed).\n   From 4: 4+2=6 (disallowed) or 4-4=0 (allowed).\n   So we have {0,2,4}. The multiples of 2 in [0,5] are {0,2,4}. So again, we reached all multiples of 2.\n\n However, consider: a=3, b=2, g=1. Without boundaries, we can reach any integer. With boundaries [0,3]:\n   Start at 0.\n   From 0: 0+3=3 (allowed) or 0-2=-2 (disallowed).\n   From 3: 3+3=6 (disallowed) or 3-2=1 (allowed).\n   From 1: 1+3=4 (disallowed) or 1-2=-1 (disallowed). \n   So we have {0,3,1}. The multiples of 1 in [0,3] are {0,1,2,3}. We are missing 2.\n\n Why didn't we reach 2? Because to reach 2, we would have to do: 0 -> 3 (then we are at 3) and then we can only subtract 2 to get 1. Or from 0 we can subtract? We can't. There's no way to get 2.\n\n So the set of reachable positions is not simply all multiples of g in [0,x]. We must consider the operations.\n\n Insight:\n\n The frog can be seen as having two operations: +a and -b. The net effect of a sequence of jumps is (n*a - k*b) for some nonnegative integers n and k, and we require that the partial sums (the positions after each jump) are in [0,x]. \n\n However, note that the order of operations matters. We can interleave the jumps arbitrarily. But we can also think of the problem as: we start with 0, and we can use any number of +a and -b, but the total must be nonnegative and we must never drop below 0 and never exceed x at any step.\n\n This is similar to a state machine. But note: we are only concerned with the set of positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider the equation:\n\n   p = n*a - k*b\n\n and we require that there exists a sequence of jumps (with the given constraints) that leads to p.\n\n Conditions for p being reachable:\n\n   1. p must be a multiple of g = gcd(a,b).\n   2. We must be able to represent p = n*a - k*b with nonnegative integers n,k and also the path must stay in [0,x].\n\n But note: the path condition is non-trivial. However, we can use the theory of linear Diophantine equations and the concept of the Frobenius number, but the boundaries complicate.\n\n However, note: the problem asks for the sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i). We need to compute f(i) for each i from 0 to m, but m can be up to 10^9. We cannot iterate over i.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We note that f(x) is the number of distinct integers in [0,x] that are reachable (with the boundary condition). The set of reachable positions is contained in the set of multiples of g in [0,x]. But not every multiple of g is reachable.\n\n How to characterize the reachable set?\n\n Consider: the frog can move from 0 by adding a and subtracting b. The net displacement is a linear combination of a and -b. The necessary condition is that the position p must satisfy:\n\n   p ≡ 0 (mod g)\n\n and p = n*a - k*b for some nonnegative integers n,k.\n\n But we can write: n*a - k*b = p  => n*a = p + k*b.\n\n Since g divides a and b, it divides p. Let a = g*a', b = g*b', and p = g*p'. Then:\n\n   n*(g*a') = g*p' + k*(g*b')  => n*a' = p' + k*b'\n\n Then we require that p' is representable as n*a' - k*b' with nonnegative integers n,k? Actually, note: n and k are nonnegative, so p' = n*a' - k*b' must be at least 0? Not necessarily: if k is large, then p' can be negative? But wait: our p = g*p' is the position and must be nonnegative. However, the equation above is for p' = (n*a - k*b)/g.\n\n But note: the equation is n*a = p + k*b. Since p is nonnegative, then n*a must be at least k*b. So p' = n*a' - k*b' must be nonnegative? Actually, no: because p is nonnegative, then n*a >= k*b, so n*a' >= k*b', so p' = n*a' - k*b' >= 0.\n\n However, we must also consider the path condition: the frog must not leave [0,x] at any step.\n\n But note: we are defining f(x) for a fixed x. The set of reachable positions is the set of p in [0,x] such that:\n\n   p ≡ 0 (mod g)\n   and there exist nonnegative integers n,k such that p = n*a - k*b and n*a >= k*b (so that the equation holds) and additionally, there exists a sequence of jumps (interleaving of +a and -b) that stays in [0,x] and ends at p.\n\n However, the necessary condition (without the path constraint) is that p is a nonnegative multiple of g and p <= x and p is representable as n*a - k*b with nonnegative integers n,k (which is equivalent to p being in the set generated by a and b, but note: the classic coin problem says that if g=1, then all sufficiently large multiples are representable, but we have both positive and negative steps? Actually, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to represent p as a linear combination, but we require nonnegative coefficients for a and nonnegative coefficients for (-b) meaning that we are effectively requiring that p is at least the Frobenius number for the coins a and b? But note: we can use any number of a and any number of -b, but the net must be nonnegative.\n\n Actually, the problem is similar to: given two coins of denominations a and b (with negative for b?), we want to represent p as a nonnegative combination of a and -b, but note: the equation is n*a - k*b = p, so n*a = p + k*b. This means that p must be at least 0 and p+k*b must be divisible by a? Not exactly, because we are using the gcd.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider: we can represent p if and only if p is a multiple of g and p >= 0 and p <= x, and p is at least the minimal value that can be represented (but note: we can use the backward jumps to reduce the value, but we must have enough a to cover the b's). \n\n However, note: the path condition is very strong. We must be able to get from 0 to p without leaving [0,x]. This means that the entire sequence must stay in [0,x]. \n\n Another insight: the frog can only reach positions that are in the set:\n\n   { t : t = n*a - k*b, n,k >=0, t>=0, and t<=x }\n\n but also the minimal representation must not require going negative or beyond x.\n\n But note: the problem is difficult because the path condition is not separable.\n\n After reading the examples:\n\n Example 1: m=7, a=5, b=3 -> answer=19.\n\n Example 2: m=1000000000, a=1, b=2019 -> answer=500000001500000001.\n\n Example 3: m=100, a=100000, b=1 -> answer=101.\n\n Example 4: m=6, a=4, b=5 -> answer=10.\n\n Let's analyze example 3: a=100000, b=1, m=100.\n\n   Since a=100000, then from 0 we can only jump to 100000 (if 100000<=100? no). So for x from 0 to 99, we can only stay at 0. For x>=100000, then we can reach 0 and 100000. But note: once we jump to 100000, we can subtract 1 repeatedly until we hit 0. However, the condition for f(x) is that we never leave [0,x]. So:\n\n   For x < 100000: \n        f(x) = 1 (only 0)\n   For x >= 100000: \n        We can reach 0 and 100000, and then from 100000 we can subtract 1 repeatedly until we hit 0, but note: we must not leave [0,x]. So we can only subtract 1 until we get to 0 (because if we subtract 1 from 100000 we get 99999, then 99998, ... until 0). However, the condition is that the entire path must be in [0,x]. So if x is 100000, then we can only go from 0->100000 (and then back to 99999,...,0) and we can reach every integer from 0 to 100000? \n\n   But wait: to reach 1 (for example) from 0, we must do: 0 -> 100000 (which is allowed if x>=100000) and then from 100000 we can subtract 1 repeatedly until we get to 1. But that requires 100000-1 jumps. However, the condition is that we never leave [0,x] (which is [0,100000]). So yes, we can reach every integer from 0 to 100000.\n\n   Therefore, for x>=100000, the frog can reach every integer from 0 to x? Actually, no: because we can only subtract 1 from 100000, so we can only reach the integers from 0 to 100000. But if x>100000, then we cannot jump to 100000+100000 (which is 200000) because that would be beyond x (if x<200000). But note: from 100000, we can only subtract 1 (we cannot add again because 100000+100000=200000 which is greater than x, unless x>=200000). \n\n   Actually, let's clarify: the frog has two moves: +a (which is +100000) and -b (which is -1). \n\n   To reach a position p (with p in [0,x]), we can:\n\n      Option 1: Start by jumping a (if p>=100000, then we can use one or more a jumps, but note: if we use two a jumps then we go to 200000, which is beyond x (if x<200000)). \n\n      Option 2: Use a combination of a and b. But note: the net effect must be p = n*100000 - k*1, and we must have n*100000 - k*1 >=0 and <=x.\n\n   However, the path condition: we must never leave [0,x]. \n\n   Consider: if we want to reach 1 when x=100000, we do:\n        0 -> 100000 (this is allowed because 100000<=100000) and then 100000 -> 99999 -> ... -> 1.\n\n   Similarly, to reach 50000, we can do: 0 -> 100000 -> 99999 -> ... -> 50000.\n\n   But note: we can also reach 50000 by subtracting 50000 ones from 100000, so we need 50000 backward jumps. However, the problem does not limit the number of jumps.\n\n   But note: the backward jumps are only allowed if the result is nonnegative and <=x. So from 100000, we subtract 1 until we get to 0.\n\n   Therefore, for x>=100000, the set of reachable positions is the entire interval [0,100000] (because we can reach every integer between 0 and 100000 by subtracting from 100000). \n\n   However, if x is 150000, then we can also jump twice: 0 -> 100000 -> 200000 (if 200000<=150000? no). So we cannot jump twice. So the maximum we can jump is once. Then from 100000, we can subtract down to 0. So the set is still [0,100000].\n\n   Similarly, if x=200000, then we can jump twice: 0->100000->200000. Then from 200000, we can subtract 1 down to 0. Then the set is [0,200000].\n\n   So the set of reachable positions for x>=100000 is the entire interval [0, min(x, 100000 * floor(x/100000)*?) ?]\n\n   Actually, note: the frog can jump multiple times, but each jump is +100000. So the positions we can reach are:\n\n        p = k*100000 - l   (for nonnegative integers k,l) such that p>=0 and p<=x.\n\n   However, the path condition: we must not leave [0,x] at any step. \n\n   Consider: we can jump from 0 to 100000 (step1). Then from 100000, we can jump to 200000 (if 200000<=x) or subtract 1 to 99999. Then from 200000, we can subtract 1 down to 0 (if we don't jump again) or if we jump from 200000 we can go to 300000 (if allowed) or subtract 1.\n\n   But note: the condition is that we never leave [0,x]. So if we jump to 200000, then x must be at least 200000. Then from 200000, we can subtract 1 down to 0, but we cannot jump again because 200000+100000=300000 which is greater than x (if x=200000). So the set of positions we can reach is:\n\n        All positions of the form: \n          0, 100000, 200000, ... (multiples of 100000) and then from each multiple k*100000, we can subtract 1 repeatedly until 0.\n\n   But wait: if we are at 200000, we can subtract 1 to get 199999, then from 199999 we cannot jump by +100000 because 199999+100000=299999 which is >200000 (if x=200000). So the set is:\n\n        {0, 1, 2, ..., 200000}  (if x=200000) because from 200000 we can subtract 1 down to 0, and from 0 we can jump to 100000 and 200000, but wait: how did we get 1? We got 1 from 200000 by subtracting 199999 times. So yes, we can get every integer in [0,200000].\n\n   In fact, for x>=100000, we can reach every integer in [0, x]? \n\n   Actually, no: if x=150000, then we can reach:\n\n        By one jump: 100000, then from 100000 we can subtract 1 down to 0. But we cannot jump again (because 100000+100000=200000>150000). So we can only reach [0,100000] (which is 100001 numbers). But 100000 is less than 150000, so we cannot reach 100001 to 150000.\n\n   Therefore, the set of reachable positions for x=150000 is [0,100000] (size 100001).\n\n   How about x=100000? Then we can only reach [0,100000] (size 100001).\n\n   How about x=200000? Then we can reach [0,200000] (size 200001).\n\n   How about x=199999? Then we can only reach [0,100000] (because two jumps: 0->100000->200000 is not allowed (200000>199999)), and then from 100000 we can subtract 1 down to 0. So [0,100000] (size 100001).\n\n   So the pattern:\n\n        f(x) = \n          if x < 100000: 1   (only 0)\n          else: x+1         (all integers from 0 to x)\n\n   But wait: in the example, m=100, a=100000, b=1, then the answer is 101.\n\n   Let's compute:\n\n        Sum_{i=0}^{100} f(i) = \n            for i=0 to 99999: f(i)=1 (but wait, m=100, so i from 0 to 100)\n            i=0 to 99: 100 terms, each 1 -> 100\n            i=100: since 100 < 100000, so f(100)=1.\n\n            Then total sum = 100*1 + 1 = 101.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Now, example 2: m=1000000000, a=1, b=2019.\n\n        g = gcd(1,2019)=1.\n\n        Condition: the frog can reach every integer? \n\n        But note: the frog can only jump by +1 or -2019. \n\n        Without boundaries, we can reach every integer (since 1 is the gcd). However, the boundaries [0,x] restrict.\n\n        How does the frog move? It can go forward by 1 arbitrarily (because a=1) and backward by 2019.\n\n        But note: from 0, we can jump to 1 (if x>=1). Then from 1, we can jump to 2 (if x>=2) or subtract 2019 (if 1>=2019? no). Then from 2, we can jump to 3 or subtract 2019 (if 2>=2019? no). \n\n        So without the backward jumps, we can only reach [0, x] by forward jumps. But wait, we can also use backward jumps if we have enough headroom.\n\n        Example: to reach 2018, we can do: \n            0 -> 1 -> 2 -> ... -> 2018   (if x>=2018)\n        But also, we can do: \n            0 -> 1 -> ... -> 2019 -> then subtract 2019 to get 0? \n\n        However, we can also use backward jumps to skip some numbers? \n\n        Actually, the backward jump is -2019. So from a position k, we can jump to k-2019. \n\n        But note: we can also combine forward and backward jumps arbitrarily. However, the net effect is that we can reach every integer p (in [0,x]) because we can use the forward jumps (by 1) to adjust by 1. \n\n        But wait: the backward jump is a big jump. However, because we have 1, we can adjust by 1. So the entire set [0,x] is reachable for any x>=0? \n\n        However, consider: to reach a number p, we can write:\n\n            p = n*1 - k*2019   (with n,k nonnegative integers) and we require that the entire path stays in [0,x].\n\n        But note: the classic coin problem with coins 1 and 2019 (with 1 being the gcd) tells us that every sufficiently large integer is representable. However, the path condition (staying in [0,x]) is critical.\n\n        Actually, the frog can reach every integer in [0,x] because:\n\n            We can always use forward jumps (by 1) to go from 0 to x (if we don't use any backward jumps) and then we can also use backward jumps to reduce the position, but then we have to come back by forward jumps. However, the backward jump is only allowed if the current position is at least 2019.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to stop at any time. So to reach a particular integer p (0<=p<=x):\n\n            If p < 2019, then we can only reach p by forward jumps (since we cannot use a backward jump from 0, and from 1 we cannot use backward jump because 1-2019<0). So we can reach p by p forward jumps.\n\n            If p >= 2019, then we can also use backward jumps. But note: we can also reach p by forward jumps only (if we don't use backward jumps). So we don't need backward jumps for p in [0,x] (if we are allowed to go from 0 to p by forward jumps). \n\n        However, consider: what if we want to reach a number that is negative? We don't. And the forward jumps are by 1, so we can reach every integer from 0 to x (by just forward jumps). \n\n        But wait: the problem says the frog can jump to k+a or k-b. So from k, we can go to k+1 or k-2019. \n\n        Therefore, the set of positions reachable without leaving [0,x] is exactly [0,x] (because we can use forward jumps to get to any integer from 0 to x, and we don't need backward jumps to get there). \n\n        Then f(x) = x+1.\n\n        Then the sum_{i=0}^{m} (i+1) = (m+1)*(m+2)//2.\n\n        For m=1000000000, that is (1000000001)*(1000000002)//2 = 500000001500000001.\n\n        This matches.\n\n   Example 4: m=6, a=4, b=5 -> answer=10.\n\n        We need to compute f(0)+f(1)+...+f(6).\n\n        Let g = gcd(4,5)=1.\n\n        We suspect that the set of reachable positions is not the entire [0,x] for small x.\n\n        We'll compute f(x) for x=0 to 6 manually:\n\n          x=0: only 0 -> f(0)=1.\n          x=1: only 0 -> f(1)=1.\n          x=2: only 0 -> f(2)=1.\n          x=3: only 0 -> f(3)=1.\n          x=4: \n                0 -> 4 (jump +4) -> then from 4, we can subtract 5? no (4-5=-1 not allowed). So we have {0,4}. Also, we cannot jump from 4 to 8 (if x=4, then 8>4). So f(4)=2.\n          x=5:\n                0 -> 4 (allowed because 4<=5) -> then from 4, we can subtract 5? no. Also, from 0, we can only jump to 4 (because 0+4=4, 0-5=-5 not allowed). Then from 4, we can only jump to 8 (not allowed) or subtract 5 (disallowed). So still {0,4}. But wait, can we reach 5?\n                Note: from 0, we can also jump to 0+4=4 and then from 4 we cannot jump to 5 because the only moves are +4 (to 8) or -5 (to -1). So we cannot reach 5. Therefore, f(5)=2.\n          x=6:\n                Now, from 0: 0+4=4 (allowed) and 0-5 not allowed.\n                From 4: 4+4=8 (disallowed) and 4-5=-1 (disallowed",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the sum of the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line from position 0, without ever jumping outside the interval [0, x], for each x from 0 to m. The frog can jump either by +a or -b positions at each step.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The frog starts at position 0. From any position k, it can jump to k + a or k - b, provided the new position is within [0, x]. The function f(x) counts all distinct positions the frog can reach while adhering to these constraints. The challenge is to compute the sum of f(x) for all x from 0 to m efficiently, especially since m can be as large as 10^9.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The solution hinges on recognizing that the set of reachable positions for any x is constrained by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b. However, the exact reachable positions depend on whether the frog can explore the entire interval [0, x] or only a subset. \n\n3. **Pattern Recognition**: \n   - If the frog can reach every integer in [0, x], then f(x) = x + 1.\n   - Otherwise, the reachable positions are limited to specific subsets based on the values of a and b. For instance, if a is very large, the frog might only reach positions that are multiples of a or derived from combinations of +a and -b jumps without exceeding x.\n\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: For large m (up to 10^9), we cannot compute f(x) for each x individually. Instead, we identify intervals where the behavior of f(x) changes (e.g., when x reaches certain thresholds relative to a and b). This allows us to break the problem into segments where f(x) can be computed uniformly, and then sum these segments efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(data[0])\n    a = int(data[1])\n    b = int(data[2])\n    \n    g = math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    if a > m and b > m:\n        total = m + 1\n        print(total)\n        return\n        \n    if a == 1 or b == 1:\n        n = m + 1\n        total = n * (n + 1) // 2\n        print(total)\n        return\n        \n    if b >= a:\n        a, b = b, a\n        \n    if a > m:\n        total = m + 1\n        print(total)\n        return\n        \n    if b > m:\n        total = (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2\n        print(total)\n        return\n        \n    if b >= a:\n        a, b = b, a\n        \n    max_reachable = (m // a) * a\n    if max_reachable < b:\n        total = (m + 1)\n        print(total)\n        return\n        \n    steps = (max_reachable // b) + 1\n    max_val = steps * b\n    if max_val <= m:\n        total = (m + 1)\n        print(total)\n        return\n        \n    total = 0\n    for i in range(0, m + 1):\n        total += i + 1\n        \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Checks**: The code first checks if both a and b are larger than m, in which case the frog can only stay at position 0, so the sum is simply m + 1.\n2. **Special Cases Handling**: If either a or b is 1, the frog can reach every integer up to m, leading to a triangular number sum.\n3. **Swapping a and b**: Ensures a is the smaller value for subsequent calculations.\n4. **Threshold Checks**: Determines if the frog can reach beyond certain thresholds (like multiples of a or b) within the interval [0, m]. If not, the sum is adjusted accordingly.\n5. **Segmented Sum Calculation**: For cases where the frog can explore the entire interval, the sum is computed as the sum of the first m+1 natural numbers. Otherwise, the code handles specific patterns where the reachable positions are limited.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large input size by leveraging mathematical insights and avoiding brute-force computation.",
