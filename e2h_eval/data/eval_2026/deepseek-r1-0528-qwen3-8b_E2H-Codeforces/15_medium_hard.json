They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament.

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem.\n\n We have a playoff tournament with 2^n teams. The tournament proceeds in phases (from phase 1 to phase n) until one champion remains.\n In each phase i (0-indexed? note: the string s has n characters, and the i-th character corresponds to the (n-i)-th phase? Actually, note the description: \n   \"the i-th phase\" is the phase with 2^(n-i) games, and the string s is given from the first phase to the last? \n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: n=3, s=\"101\"\n\n But wait, the problem says: \n   \"string s of length n\" and then: \n      if s_i is 0 -> during the i-th phase (which is the phase with 2^(n-i) games) the lower skill wins.\n      if s_i is 1 -> during the i-th phase the higher skill wins.\n\n And the tournament structure is fixed: \n   First phase: 2^(n-1) games (so phase 1: n=3 -> 4 games, then 2, then 1).\n\n How does the bracket work?\n   Initially, we have teams 1 to 2^n, ordered by increasing index (which corresponds to increasing skill? Not necessarily, because p is a permutation).\n\n But note: the permutation p is arbitrary, but we are to determine for which x (which is a team number from 1 to 2^n) there exists a permutation p such that the team with skill x wins the tournament.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Understand the tournament bracket:\n    - The bracket is fixed: in the first phase, the matches are between consecutive teams: (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4), ... (2^(n-1)-1 vs 2^(n-1)), then the next phase reuses the winners and arranges them again by the original order? Actually, the problem says:\n\n        \"in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"1 vs 2\" plays against the winner of the game \"3 vs 4\", then the winner of the game \"5 vs 6\" plays against the winner of the game \"7 vs 8\", and so on.\"\n\n    This is a standard single elimination bracket with the initial ordering.\n\n 2. The outcome of each match in a phase is determined by the character in s for that phase.\n\n 3. We are to find all x (from 1 to 2^n) for which there exists a permutation p (which is a bijection from {1,...,2^n} to {1,...,2^n}) such that the team with skill x wins.\n\n Observation:\n\n Since the permutation p assigns skills arbitrarily, we can assign the skill numbers arbitrarily to the teams. However, the bracket is fixed (by the initial ordering of the teams). \n\n But note: the problem says the team with skill x is the one that must win. So we can fix the skill of the team that we want to be the champion (say, team i has skill x) and then assign the other skills arbitrarily.\n\n However, the catch: the outcomes of the matches depend on the relative skills in each match.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Let's denote:\n   There are n rounds (phases). The i-th phase (i from 0 to n-1) has 2^(n-i-1) games (if we consider the first phase as phase 0) or the problem indexes from 1 to n.\n\n Actually, the problem says: the string s has n characters. The first character corresponds to the first phase (with 2^(n-1) games). Then the second character to the next phase (with 2^(n-2) games) and so on.\n\n But note: the example input \"3\\n101\": \n   n=3, so 8 teams. \n   Phase 1 (first character '1'): 4 games (higher skill wins)\n   Phase 2 (second character '0'): 2 games (lower skill wins)\n   Phase 3 (third character '1'): 1 game (higher skill wins)\n\n However, wait: the tournament has 7 games, so 3 phases: \n   Phase 1: 4 games -> reduces from 8 to 4\n   Phase 2: 2 games -> reduces from 4 to 2\n   Phase 3: 1 game -> reduces from 2 to 1\n\n So the i-th character in s (0-indexed) corresponds to the (n-i)-th phase? Actually, the problem says: \n   \"during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\"\n\n So the first phase (i=0) has 2^(n-0) = 2^n? That doesn't match. \n\n Let me read again: \n   \"if s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\"\n\n For i=0: 2^(n-0) = 2^n games. But we start with 2^n teams, and the first phase should have 2^(n-1) games. \n\n Correction: the problem says the entire tournament has 2^n teams and 2^n-1 games, and the first phase (i=0) has 2^(n-1) games. \n\n But wait, the description says: \n   \"the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\" \n\n For the first phase (i=0): 2^(n-0) = 2^n? That is too many.\n\n Alternatively, perhaps the indexing is off by one? \n\n Looking at the example: n=3, then the phases should be:\n   Phase 1: 2^(n-1) = 4 games -> but according to the formula 2^(n-i) for i=0: 2^3=8, which is not 4.\n\n Let me check the problem statement again: \n   \"the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\"\n\n But then in the example, the first phase (i=0) would be 2^(3-0)=8 games, which is too many.\n\n Alternatively, they might index the string s from the last phase to the first? Or maybe the i-th character corresponds to the phase that happens when there are 2^(n-i) teams remaining?\n\n Let me reinterpret: \n   The tournament starts with 2^n teams. After the first phase, we have 2^(n-1) teams. Then the next phase has 2^(n-2) teams, and so on.\n\n And the problem says: the string s has n characters. The first character (s_0) is for the first phase (when there are 2^n teams? No, because the first phase uses 2^(n-1) games). \n\n Actually, the problem says: \n   \"the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\"\n\n But note: the entire tournament has n phases. The first phase (i=0) should have 2^(n-1) games (since after that we have 2^(n-1) teams). \n\n Therefore, the formula must be: the i-th phase (0-indexed) has 2^(n-1-i) games? Then for i=0: 2^(n-1) games, for i=1: 2^(n-2) games, etc.\n\n But the problem says: \"the phase with 2^(n-i) games\". \n\n Wait, if we consider the phase index starting from the beginning, then the first phase (i=0) should have 2^(n-1) games, but the problem writes 2^(n-i) for i=0: 2^n, which is not matching.\n\n Alternatively, they might define the phase index differently: the first phase is i=1, then i=2, ... up to i=n. Then the string s is given for i from 1 to n, and the i-th phase has 2^(n-i+1) games? \n\n Let me check the example: \n   n=3, and the example s=\"101\"\n\n   If the first phase (i=1) has 2^(n-1) = 4 games, then the formula for the i-th phase (if i is 1-indexed) would be 2^(n-i+1)? \n        i=1: 2^(3-1+1)=2^3=8 -> no.\n\n Another possibility: the problem means the phase index i (0-indexed) corresponds to the round where the number of teams is 2^(n-i) at the start of the round? \n\n Then:\n   Phase 0: 2^n teams -> 2^(n-0) = 2^n, but the first round actually uses 2^(n-1) games to reduce to 2^(n-1) teams.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might mean the phase index i (0-indexed) is for the round that leaves 2^(n-i-1) teams? \n\n Let me re-read: \n   \"the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\"\n\n And the example: \n   Input: n=3, s=\"101\"\n\n   They say: \n      first phase (i=0): 2^(3-0)=8 games? But we only have 8 teams and the first round should have 4 games.\n\n I think there is a misunderstanding. \n\n Let me look at the example output: \n   Input: \n      3\n      101\n\n   Output: \n      4 5 6 7\n\n How can we explain this?\n\n Alternate interpretation: the string s is given from the final phase to the first phase? \n\n But the problem says: \"the i-th phase\", meaning the first phase is the first one.\n\n After reading the problem statement again: \n   \"The tournament consists of 2^n-1 games. They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, ... (so 2^(n-1) games).\"\n\n Then: \"After that, only 2^(n-1) teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where 2^(n-2) games are played: ...\"\n\n So the first phase is the one with 2^(n-1) games, the second phase with 2^(n-2) games, and so on until the last phase (the n-th phase) with 2^0=1 game.\n\n Now, the string s has n characters. The problem says: \n   \"These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows: ... during the i-th phase\"\n\n So the first character (index0) is for the first phase (which has 2^(n-1) games). Then the second character (index1) is for the second phase (which has 2^(n-2) games) and so on.\n\n But the problem states: \"if s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\".\n\n However, for i=0: 2^(n-0)=2^n games -> but the first phase has 2^(n-1) games.\n\n This is inconsistent.\n\n Let me check the example: \n   Input: n=3, s=\"101\"\n\n   According to the problem's own description, the first phase (i=0) should have 2^(3-0)=8 games, but that is not what the tournament description says.\n\n There seems to be an error in the problem statement.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"the phase with 2^(n-i) games\". \n\n For the first phase (i=0): 2^(n-0) = 8 (for n=3) -> 8 games. However, we have 8 teams, so 8 games would require 16 teams? \n\n Actually, no: in each game one team is eliminated, and we start with 8 teams and need 7 games to get a champion. \n\n Let me count the games per phase as described:\n\n   Phase 1: 4 games -> 4 eliminations -> 4 teams left.\n   Phase 2: 2 games -> 2 eliminations -> 2 teams left.\n   Phase 3: 1 game -> 1 elimination -> 1 team left.\n\n Total: 7 games.\n\n But the problem says the i-th phase has 2^(n-i) games. For n=3:\n   i=0: 2^(3) = 8 -> but we only have 4 games in the first phase.\n\n Alternatively, the problem meant: the i-th phase (0-indexed) has 2^(n-1-i) games? Then:\n   i=0: 2^(2)=4\n   i=1: 2^(1)=2\n   i=2: 2^(0)=1\n\n This matches.\n\n Therefore, the problem statement likely has a typo. It should say: \"the phase with 2^(n-1-i) games\".\n\n However, the problem says: \"the phase with 2^(n-i) games\".\n\n But wait, the example input includes n=1, n=2, and n=3. \n\n For n=1: \n   There is 2 teams. The tournament has 1 game. \n   The string s is of length 1. \n   According to the problem: the phase has 2^(1-0)=2 games? But we only have 1 game.\n\n So that doesn't match either.\n\n Alternatively, if we consider the phase index i from 0 to n-1, then the number of games in the i-th phase is 2^(n-1-i). Then for n=1: i=0 -> 2^(0)=1 game.\n\n So the problem intended to say: the i-th phase (0-indexed) has 2^(n-1-i) games.\n\n And the problem says: \"the phase with 2^(n-i) games\" is a mistake. \n\n Since the problem is from a competition, we must rely on the examples and the expected outputs.\n\n Let me check the example inputs and outputs:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \n        3\n        101\n\n   Output: \n        4 5 6 7\n\n Example 2: \n   Input: \n        1\n        1\n\n   Output: \n        2\n\n Example 3: \n   Input: \n        2\n        01\n\n   Output: \n        2 3\n\n How do we solve?\n\n We know that the tournament bracket is fixed. The matches are predetermined by the initial ordering.\n\n We are allowed to assign any permutation of skills (1 to 2^n) to the teams.\n\n We wish to know: for which x (which is a team number, i.e., the team initially at position x) can we assign skills such that the tournament outcome is a win for team x.\n\n However, note: the problem does not fix the assignment of the skill x to a particular team. The team with skill x is the one that must win. But note: the teams are labeled from 1 to 2^n, and the bracket is fixed. \n\n But wait: the problem says \"the team with skill x\", meaning we can assign the skill x arbitrarily to any of the teams? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"You are given a string s ... Find all winning integers x in ascending order.\"\n\n And note: the permutation p is a permutation of integers 1 to 2^n. So x must be one of these integers (from 1 to 2^n). \n\n However, the condition for x being winning is: there exists a permutation p such that the team with skill x wins the tournament.\n\n But note: the bracket structure is fixed, so the matches are predetermined. However, we can assign the skill values arbitrarily.\n\n Steps for solution:\n\n 1. We have 2^n teams. The bracket is fixed: \n        Match 1: team1 vs team2, Match 2: team3 vs team4, ... \n        Then the next round: the winners of match1 and match2 (which are the two winners from the first two teams) play, then the winners of match3 and match4 (from the next two) play, etc.\n\n 2. We are given a string s of length n (each character is either '0' or '1').\n\n 3. For each phase i (0-indexed from 0 to n-1), the outcome is determined by s[i]:\n        if s[i] == '1': then in that phase, the higher skilled team wins.\n        if s[i] == '0': then the lower skilled team wins.\n\n 4. We wish to know: for which x (from 1 to 2^n) there exists an assignment of skills (a permutation) such that the team with skill x wins.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n Instead of trying to assign the skill x to a particular team and then assign the others arbitrarily, we can think:\n\n We want to know: is there an assignment of the 2^n distinct skill levels (from 1 to 2^n) such that the tournament produces the champion being the team with skill x.\n\n However, note: the teams are fixed in the bracket. The bracket is fixed, but the skill assignment is arbitrary.\n\n But here is the catch: the outcome of a match in a phase depends on the relative skills of the two teams in that match and the rule of that phase.\n\n How can we determine the necessary conditions for a team (say, we want team k to win) to be assigned the skill x?\n\n Let me denote the bracket as a binary tree. Each node represents a match. The root is the champion.\n\n The tournament has n rounds (phases). In each phase, the matches are independent and the outcome is determined by the rule.\n\n However, note: the assignment of skills must be consistent across the entire bracket.\n\n We can use the following idea:\n\n   We know the entire set of skills is fixed (numbers 1 to 2^n). We are free to assign them arbitrarily to the teams.\n\n   The condition for a team to win is that in every match it participates, it must win, and the opponents must lose.\n\n   But the opponents' skills are also assigned arbitrarily (from the remaining numbers). \n\n   However, the rules for each phase are fixed: in a phase with rule '1', the higher skilled wins; in rule '0', the lower skilled wins.\n\n   So for a particular match in a phase, the outcome is determined by the rule and the two skills.\n\n   We are allowed to assign the skills arbitrarily, so we can choose the skills for the teams that are not the champion arbitrarily.\n\n   But note: the champion must be the team with skill x, and we must assign the other skills arbitrarily from the remaining numbers.\n\n   However, we are not forced to assign the champion (the team we want) to a particular initial position. Wait, note: the problem says \"the team with skill x\", meaning we can assign the skill x to any team? \n\n   But note: the bracket is fixed, so the matches are predetermined by the initial positions. \n\n   However, the problem does not specify that the team with skill x must be a particular initial team. It just says \"the team with skill x\". \n\n   But wait: the teams are labeled from 1 to 2^n, and the bracket is defined by the initial labeling. \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"the team with skill x\" wins. The skill x is a number, and the team that has that skill is the one that must win. \n\n   But note: the same skill x is unique (since p is a permutation). \n\n   However, we can assign the skill x to any team we wish. \n\n   Therefore, we are allowed to choose which initial team gets the skill x.\n\n   But wait, the bracket is fixed: the matches are predetermined. So the path a team takes is fixed by its initial position.\n\n   However, we can assign the skill x to any initial team. Then, we assign the rest arbitrarily.\n\n   Therefore, the problem becomes: we can assign the skill x to any of the 2^n teams, and then assign the other 2^n-1 skills arbitrarily. Then, we must check if the tournament outcome (given the rules) can be the team with skill x.\n\n   But note: we are free to assign the other skills arbitrarily, so we can set the skills of the teams along the path of the champion to be favorable (according to the rules) and set the skills of the opponents to be unfavorable.\n\n   However, the rules are fixed per phase.\n\n   We can use a recursive/dynamic programming approach on the tournament bracket.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think: for a fixed assignment of the champion (skill x) to a particular initial team (say, we choose to put x on team i), then we must ensure that:\n\n        In the first phase: \n            For the matches that the champion participates in, the outcome must be a win.\n\n        But note: the champion's path is fixed (if we assign x to team i, then the champion must win in every match from the first phase to the last).\n\n   However, we are allowed to assign the other skills arbitrarily, so we can set the champion's skill to x and the other teams' skills arbitrarily (as long as they are distinct and cover the rest).\n\n   The challenge: we must assign the other skills such that in every match the champion (with skill x) wins, and the opponent loses.\n\n   Conditions for a match:\n\n        Let the two teams in a match have skills a and b, and the rule for the phase is r (either '0' or '1').\n\n        The outcome is:\n            if r='1': the higher skilled wins -> so the champion (with skill x) must be the higher skilled than the opponent, i.e., x > opponent_skill.\n            if r='0': the lower skilled wins -> so the champion (with skill x) must be the lower skilled than the opponent, i.e., x < opponent_skill.\n\n        However, wait: the champion is one of the two teams. So we require:\n\n            In a match where the champion is one of the two, we require:\n                if rule is '1': x must be greater than the opponent's skill.\n                if rule is '0': x must be less than the opponent's skill.\n\n        But note: the opponent's skill is chosen arbitrarily from the remaining numbers (excluding x and the skills already used). \n\n        However, the entire assignment must be consistent: the skills are distinct and cover 1 to 2^n.\n\n        Moreover, the matches are hierarchical: the champion must defeat opponents in several rounds.\n\n   But note: the same opponent cannot be used twice, and the same skill cannot be assigned twice.\n\n   However, we are free to assign the skills arbitrarily, so we can set the opponents' skills to be exactly the ones that make the champion win.\n\n   But we must also consider that the opponents themselves must win their previous matches.\n\n   This becomes complicated.\n\n Alternative Insight (using the bracket as a minimal requirement):\n\n   We can consider the entire tournament as a sequence of matches that the champion must win. The champion must be present in the final, and the path from the champion to the final is fixed.\n\n   However, we can choose the initial team for the champion arbitrarily. So we can choose the champion's initial position arbitrarily.\n\n   Then, for a fixed initial position of the champion, we must assign the skills such that:\n\n        In every match the champion participates, the condition holds (x must be either greater or less than the opponent, depending on the rule).\n\n        Additionally, the opponents that the champion faces must have been won by their respective paths.\n\n   But note: the entire assignment must be a permutation.\n\n   We can use a greedy assignment:\n\n        We know the champion's skill is x. We can assign the other skills arbitrarily.\n\n        The condition for the champion to win a match is:\n\n            In a match with rule '1': we must assign the champion's skill (x) to be greater than the opponent's skill.\n            In a match with rule '0': we must assign the champion's skill (x) to be less than the opponent's skill.\n\n        However, the opponents in the champion's path must be assigned skills that satisfy these conditions.\n\n        Also, the non-champion teams must be assigned the remaining skills.\n\n   But note: the bracket is fixed, so the set of opponents the champion faces is fixed (once the champion's initial position is chosen). \n\n   However, we can choose the champion's initial position arbitrarily. Therefore, we must check for which x there exists an initial position (team index) such that we can assign the skills to all teams (including the opponents) so that the champion wins.\n\n   How to check for a fixed champion (with skill x) and a fixed initial position (say, the champion is team i)?\n\n        Let the bracket be represented as a complete binary tree with 2^n leaves (teams). The champion must be one of the leaves.\n\n        The champion will face several opponents in the subsequent rounds. In fact, the champion must defeat one opponent per round (except the final which is the last opponent). \n\n        The total number of matches the champion participates in is n.\n\n        The opponents in the champion's path are determined by the bracket. \n\n        However, note: the bracket structure is fixed. The matches are:\n\n            Round 1: the champion is in a match with one fixed opponent (the adjacent team in the initial bracket).\n            Round 2: the champion must then face the winner of a match between two teams (one of which is the opponent from round 1, and the other is a new team? Actually, no: the bracket is fixed and the matches are predetermined by the initial ordering.\n\n        Actually, the bracket is fixed: the initial ordering is [1,2,...,2^n]. The champion's initial position i must be placed at leaf i (0-indexed or 1-indexed? The problem uses 1-indexed: team1, team2, ...).\n\n        The bracket is built by:\n\n            Match j in round 1: teams 2*j-1 and 2*j (for j from 0 to 2^(n-1)-1)\n\n            Then the winner of match j in round 1 goes to round 2, and in round 2 the matches are between the winner of match j and the winner of match j+2^(n-1) (or something like that? Actually, the problem says: \n                \"then the winner of the game '1 vs 2' plays against the winner of the game '3 vs 4'\", then the next two, etc.\n\n        This is a standard single elimination bracket: the matches in round 1: (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), (7,8) for n=3.\n        Then round 2: (winner1, winner2) and (winner3, winner4) but wait, the problem says: \n            \"in the first one of them, the winner of the game '1 vs 2' plays against the winner of the game '3 vs 4'\", then the winner of '5 vs 6' vs '7 vs 8'.\n\n        Actually, the bracket is a balanced binary tree. The champion's path is:\n\n            Round 1: match with the team immediately next to it (if we start at an odd-numbered team, then the first match is against the next even-numbered team).\n\n            Round 2: the champion must face the winner of a match that includes two teams that are two apart from the champion's initial position? \n\n        The bracket can be represented by a binary tree. The champion's matches are predetermined by the initial position.\n\n        We can precompute the list of opponents (by their initial indices) that the champion must face in each round.\n\n        But note: the assignment of skills is arbitrary, so we can assign the skills arbitrarily to the teams. However, the opponents must be assigned skills that are consistent with the rules.\n\n        Conditions:\n\n            Let the champion be assigned skill x.\n\n            Let the set of opponents in the champion's path be O = {o1, o2, ..., o_{n}} (each o_i is the skill value of the opponent in the i-th round).\n\n            In the first round (phase0): \n                if s[0]=='1', then x must be greater than o1.\n                if s[0]=='0', then x must be less than o1.\n\n            In the second round (phase1):\n                if s[1]=='1', then x must be greater than o2.\n                if s[1]=='0', then x must be less than o2.\n\n            But wait: the opponent o2 is the winner of a match in the first round. That match was between two teams (say, a and b). The winner of that match (o2) must be the one that advances. \n\n            However, we are free to assign the skills arbitrarily, so we can choose the outcome of that match arbitrarily by assigning appropriate skills to a and b? \n\n            But note: the champion's path is fixed, but the opponents are determined by the entire bracket. However, we can assign the skills arbitrarily, so we can control the outcomes.\n\n        Actually, we are not constrained by the internal matches except that the champion must win. The opponents we face are the ones that are in the bracket, but we can assign the skills arbitrarily to all teams.\n\n        Therefore, the condition for the champion to win is that we can assign the skills to the entire bracket such that:\n\n            For each match in the champion's path: the condition (x > opponent_skill or x < opponent_skill) holds.\n\n            Additionally, the opponents that the champion faces must be the ones that win their respective subtrees.\n\n        But note: the opponent in the first round is the team that is adjacent to the champion's initial position. Then the opponent in the second round is the winner of the match between the two teams that are two positions away from the champion? \n\n        Actually, the bracket is fixed. The champion's path is fixed by the initial position.\n\n        Let me draw the bracket for n=2 (4 teams):\n\n            Teams: [1,2,3,4]\n\n            Round1: \n                Match1: 1 vs 2\n                Match2: 3 vs 4\n\n            Round2:\n                The winner of Match1 vs the winner of Match2.\n\n            Now, if the champion is team1 (initial position 1), then the path is:\n                Round1: opponent is team2.\n                Round2: opponent is the winner of the match between team3 and team4.\n\n            Similarly, if the champion is team2, then the path is:\n                Round1: opponent is team1.\n                Round2: opponent is the winner of the match between team3 and team4.\n\n            But wait, the bracket structure for the second round is: the winner of the first match (which is between 1 and 2) plays the winner of the second match (between 3 and 4). \n\n            So the champion's path is fixed by the initial position.\n\n        Therefore, we must consider: for a fixed x, we can choose the initial position (from 1 to 2^n) arbitrarily. Then we must assign the other 2^n-1 skills arbitrarily.\n\n        The conditions for the champion to win are:\n\n            In round i (0-indexed), the champion must have a skill x that is either greater or less than the opponent's skill (depending on s[i]), and the opponent's skill must be chosen from the available numbers.\n\n        However, the same set of skills must be used for the entire bracket. \n\n        We can use a different idea:\n\n            Consider that the entire set of skills is {1,2,...,2^n}. The champion has skill x.\n\n            The tournament requires that the champion defeats n opponents (one per round). In each round, the champion must beat one opponent. The opponents must be distinct.\n\n            Additionally, the opponents themselves must have defeated their own sets of opponents.\n\n            But note: the opponents in the champion's path are predetermined by the bracket and the initial position.\n\n            However, we are free to choose the initial position arbitrarily. Therefore, we can choose the initial position that minimizes the constraints.\n\n        Conditions for a fixed initial position and fixed x:\n\n            Let the champion's path be a list of opponents (by their initial indices) that the champion must face: [o1, o2, ..., o_{n}].\n\n            In round i (0-indexed), the condition is:\n                if s[i] == '1': x > o_{i+1}\n                if s[i] == '0': x < o_{i+1}\n\n            But note: the opponent o_{i+1} is the winner of a subtree of the bracket. The subtree for the opponent in round i contains 2^(n-i-1) teams (excluding the champion's team and the teams already used). \n\n            However, we are free to assign the skills arbitrarily, so we can assign the skills in the champion's path and the opponents' paths arbitrarily.\n\n            The key: we must assign the skills in such a way that the champion's conditions hold, and also the conditions for the opponents to win their previous matches hold.\n\n            For the opponent in round i, say o_i, to be the winner of their subtree, the entire subtree must have been won by o_i. \n\n            The condition for o_i to win their subtree is analogous: for each match in the subtree, the rule applies and the winner is the one that satisfies the rule.\n\n            However, we are free to assign the skills arbitrarily, so we can always arrange the skills in the subtree to make o_i win, provided that o_i is assigned a skill that is compatible with the rules of the entire subtree.\n\n            But note: the champion's condition for the match against o_i is fixed by the rule of that round (round i). And the condition for o_i to win their own subtree is independent and might impose conditions on the relative skill of o_i and the other teams in the subtree.\n\n            However, since we are free to assign arbitrarily, we can always choose the skills in the subtree to satisfy the condition for o_i to win, as long as we are allowed to use the entire set of numbers excluding x and the skills already used in the champion's path.\n\n        Therefore, the only constraints for the champion to win are the direct conditions (against the n opponents) and the fact that the opponents must be assigned distinct skills.\n\n        But note: the opponents are distinct and the entire set of skills is fixed.\n\n        We can assign the skills arbitrarily, so the only constraint is:\n\n            Let the champion's opponents (in order) be o1, o2, ..., o_{n}. Then:\n\n                In round 0: condition on o1: \n                    if s[0]=='1': x > o1\n                    if s[0]=='0': x < o1\n\n                In round 1: condition on o2:\n                    if s[1]=='1': x > o2\n                    if s[1]=='0': x < o2\n\n                ...\n\n            And all o_i must be distinct and distinct from x.\n\n            Additionally, the set of skills used for the opponents must be a subset of the 2^n-1 numbers excluding x.\n\n        But note: the opponents are not just one number each: each opponent o_i is the winner of a subtree of size 2^(n-i-1) teams. However, we are free to assign the skills arbitrarily, so we can assign the entire subtree arbitrarily. The only requirement is that the champion's condition and the opponent's condition (to win the subtree) must be satisfied.\n\n        However, the condition for the opponent to win the subtree is automatically satisfied if we assign the skills appropriately, as long as we are allowed to use the available numbers.\n\n        The catch: the champion's conditions and the opponents' conditions might conflict if the same number is required for two different purposes.\n\n        But note: we are free to assign arbitrarily, so we can reserve the necessary numbers for the champion's opponents and the rest for the other teams.\n\n        The minimal requirement is that the champion's opponents must be assigned distinct numbers, and these numbers must satisfy the inequalities with x.\n\n        Specifically, for round i, we need a number o_i such that:\n\n            if s[i]=='1': o_i < x\n            if s[i]=='0': o_i > x\n\n        And all these o_i must be distinct and not equal to x.\n\n        But wait, there is more: the entire set of skills is {1,2,...,2^n}. The champion has x. The opponents in the champion's path are n opponents, and there are other teams that are eliminated without playing against the champion. However, these other teams must also be assigned distinct skills.\n\n        But note: the champion's path only requires n opponents (one per round). The rest of the teams (2^n - 1 - n) are not directly involved in the champion's matches, but they must be assigned distinct skills.\n\n        However, the condition for the champion to win is independent of the other teams, because we can set the outcomes of the other matches arbitrarily by assigning the skills appropriately.\n\n        Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for a fixed initial position and fixed x is:\n\n            There exist n distinct numbers (o1, o2, ..., o_n) (each from {1,...,2^n}\\{x}) such that:\n\n                For i from 0 to n-1:\n                    if s[i]=='1': o_i < x\n                    if s[i]=='0': o_i > x\n\n            But note: the initial position matters! The initial position determines which specific teams are the opponents. However, we are free to choose the initial position arbitrarily.\n\n        Therefore, we can choose the initial position that minimizes the constraints on the opponents.\n\n        However, wait: the bracket structure is fixed, so the set of opponents (by their initial indices) is fixed by the initial position. But the condition on the skill of the opponent does not depend on the initial index, only on the rule and the round.\n\n        But note: the entire set of skills is fixed, and the assignment is arbitrary. The condition for the champion to win is purely on the existence of n distinct numbers (for the opponents) that satisfy the inequalities.\n\n        However, the bracket structure does not impose additional constraints on the opponents' skills beyond the direct condition (x > o_i or x < o_i) for the match in round i.\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all integers \\( x \\) such that there exists a permutation of skills \\( p \\) (a bijection from \\( \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 2^n\\} \\) to itself) where the team with skill \\( x \\) wins the tournament. The tournament follows a fixed bracket structure, and the outcome of each phase is determined by the given string \\( s \\), where each character indicates whether the higher or lower skilled team wins in that phase.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament involves \\( 2^n \\) teams competing in a single-elimination bracket. The string \\( s \\) dictates the outcome of each phase: if \\( s_i \\) is '1', the higher-skilled team wins; if '0', the lower-skilled team wins. The goal is to find all \\( x \\) for which a valid skill assignment exists such that the team with skill \\( x \\) emerges as the champion.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For a team with skill \\( x \\) to win the tournament, it must defeat opponents in each round according to the phase's rule. Specifically, in each round \\( i \\), the opponent's skill must be less than \\( x \\) if \\( s_i \\) is '1' (higher skill wins), or greater than \\( x \\) if \\( s_i \\) is '0' (lower skill wins). \n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each \\( x \\) from 1 to \\( 2^n \\), check if there exists a sequence of \\( n \\) distinct opponents (each corresponding to a round) such that each opponent's skill meets the condition specified by the respective phase's rule in \\( s \\). The solution involves verifying these conditions for all possible \\( x \\).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks each \\( x \\) (from 1 to \\( 2^n \\)) and for each \\( x \\), verifies \\( n \\) conditions. Since \\( n \\) can be up to 18, \\( 2^n \\) is up to 262,144, making the approach feasible with efficient condition checks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    s_str = data[1].strip()\n\n    total_teams = 1 << n   # 2^n\n\n    winning_numbers = []\n\n    for x in range(1, total_teams + 1):\n        low_required = 0\n        high_required = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            if s_str[i] == '1':\n                low_required += 1\n            else:\n                high_required += 1\n\n        current_low = 0\n        current_high = 0\n        available_low = [num for num in range(1, total_teams + 1) if num != x]\n        left = [num for num in available_low if num < x]\n        right = [num for num in available_low if num > x]\n\n        found = True\n        l_idx, r_idx = 0, 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            if s_str[i] == '1':\n                if current_high >= len(right) or (current_high < len(right) and right[current_high] <= x):\n                    found = False\n                    break\n                current_high += 1\n            else:\n                if current_low >= len(left) or (current_low < len(left) and left[current_low] >= x):\n                    found = False\n                    break\n                current_low += 1\n\n        if found:\n            winning_numbers.append(x)\n\n    winning_numbers.sort()\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, winning_numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer \\( n \\) (number of phases) and a string \\( s \\) (determining phase outcomes).\n2. **Initialization**: Calculate the total number of teams (\\( 2^n \\)) and initialize a list to store winning numbers.\n3. **Checking Each \\( x \\)**: For each \\( x \\) from 1 to \\( 2^n \\):\n   - **Count Requirements**: Determine how many phases require opponents with skills less than \\( x \\) ('1') or greater than \\( x \\) ('0').\n   - **Validate Conditions**: Use two pointers to track available low and high skills (excluding \\( x \\)).
