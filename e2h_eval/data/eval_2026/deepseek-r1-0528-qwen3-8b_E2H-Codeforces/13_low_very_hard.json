For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes. The notes are from the set: ['C','C#','D','D#','E','F','F#','G','G#','A','B','H'] (12 notes)\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (0 to 11) representing the semitone index.\n 2. Since the chord is an unordered set, we will consider all permutations (there are only 6) and check the conditions for major and minor.\n\n Conditions:\n For major: There must exist an ordering (x, y, z) such that:\n   distance(x, y) = 4 semitones\n   distance(y, z) = 3 semitones\n\n For minor: There must exist an ordering (x, y, z) such that:\n   distance(x, y) = 3 semitones\n   distance(y, z) = 4 semitones\n\n Note: The distance between two notes is calculated by their cyclic positions. Since the scale is cyclic, we can compute the shortest distance? \n However, note the problem: the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one. But wait, the example says: between E and C is 8 semitones (because we go E->F->F#->G->G#->A->B->H->C: 8 steps). \n\n Actually, we are given three distinct notes. We can assign each note a value in [0,11]. Then the distance from note i to note j is (j - i) mod 12, but we want the positive distance in the forward direction (so if we have two notes, we can compute the distance as (j - i) % 12, but if negative we adjust).\n\n However, note the example: \"E to C\" -> E is at index 4 (if C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, B=10, H=11). \n Then from E (4) to C (0): \n   If we move forward: from E to F(5), F#(6), G(7), G#(8), A(9), B(10), H(11), then back to C(0): that's 12 - (4 - 0) = 8? Actually, we can compute the forward distance from E to C as (0 + 12 - 4) % 12 = 8, which is correct.\n\n But note: the problem says the distance from E to C is 8 semitones. So we need the forward circular distance.\n\n How to compute the distance from note a to note b (with a and b being numbers from 0 to 11) in the forward direction?\n   Let d = (b - a) % 12\n   But if d is negative, we add 12 and then take modulo? Alternatively, we can do: \n   d_forward = (b - a) % 12\n   However, if (b - a) is negative, then (b - a) % 12 gives a positive number? Actually, in Python, modulus for negative can be tricky.\n\n Example: \n   a = 4 (E), b = 0 (C): (0-4) % 12 = (-4) % 12 = 8 (since -4 + 12 = 8). That works.\n\n But what about from C to E? (4 - 0) % 12 = 4, which is correct.\n\n However, note: the problem says the chord is an unordered set. We are allowed to order arbitrarily. But the condition requires consecutive distances: 4 and then 3 (for major) or 3 and then 4 (for minor). And the entire span from the first to the last should be 7 semitones (because 4+3=7). \n\n But note: the entire span from the first to the last is 7 semitones, meaning that the total circle is 12, so the remaining part (the other way) would be 12-7=5, but that doesn't matter because we are only concerned with the consecutive steps.\n\n However, the condition is defined on an ordering. So we must check all 6 permutations.\n\n Approach:\n 1. Create a mapping from note name to index.\n 2. Read the input string, split it to get three note names.\n 3. Convert each note to its index (0-11).\n 4. Generate all 6 permutations of these three indices.\n 5. For each permutation (a, b, c):\n      d1 = (b - a) %",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for a major or minor chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Mapping**: Convert each note into a numerical value (0 to 11) based on its position in the chromatic scale. For example, 'C' maps to 0, 'C#' to 1, and so on up to 'H' which maps to 11.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For any two notes, the forward distance (from note A to note B) is calculated as `(B - A) % 12`. This ensures the distance accounts for the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three notes. For each permutation, check if the distances between consecutive notes match the criteria for a major chord (4 semitones followed by 3 semitones) or a minor chord (3 semitones followed by 4 semitones).\n4. **Decision Making**: If any permutation satisfies the major chord condition, output \"major\". If any permutation satisfies the minor chord condition, output \"minor\". If neither condition is met, output \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    notes_str = input().strip().split()\n    note_to_index = {\n        'C': 0, 'C#': 1, 'D': 2, 'D#': 3, 'E': 4, 'F': 5, 'F#': 6,\n        'G': 7, 'G#': 8, 'A': 9, 'B': 10, 'H': 11\n    }\n    \n    indices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes_str]\n    \n    from itertools import permutations\n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for perm in permutations(indices):\n        a, b, c = perm\n        d_ab = (b - a) % 12\n        d_bc = (c - b) % 12\n        d_ac = (c - a) % 12\n        \n        if d_ab == 4 and d_bc == 3:\n            found_major = True\n            \n        if d_ab == 3 and d_bc == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n    if found_major and not found_minor:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor and not found_major:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input consists of three space-separated notes. These notes are split into a list for further processing.\n2. **Note Conversion**: Each note is converted to its corresponding numerical value using a predefined dictionary that maps note names to their positions in the chromatic scale.\n3. **Permutations Generation**: All possible orderings of the three notes are generated. For each ordering, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated.\n4. **Chord Classification**: For each permutation, the code checks if the distances between the first-second and second-third notes match the major (4 and 3 semitones) or minor (3 and 4 semitones) chord conditions.\n5. **Output Decision**: Based on the checks, the code outputs \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" if neither condition is met. The solution efficiently handles all edge cases by thoroughly checking all permutations of the input notes.",
