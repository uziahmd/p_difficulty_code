Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers: n (number of vertices) and a (the target angle in degrees)\n\n In a regular convex n-gon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is (360/n) degrees.\n\n We are to choose three distinct vertices (v1, v2, v3) such that the angle at v2 (with sides from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3) is as close as possible to `a`.\n\n Note: The polygon is regular and convex, and the vertices are numbered 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n How to think:\n\n The angle at vertex v2 can be formed by two edges: one going to v1 and one going to v3. Since the polygon is regular, we can consider the arcs (number of edges) between the vertices.\n\n Let's fix vertex v2. Then, the two other vertices must lie on two different sides of v2. However, note that the angle is measured from the two sides emanating from v2.\n\n In a regular convex polygon, the interior angle at any vertex is fixed? Actually, no: we are allowed to form an angle by taking two edges that are not necessarily adjacent to v2. But note: the problem says \"the value\" (which is the angle) should be minimized.\n\n However, note the example: for a square (n=4), the possible angles are 45° and 90°.\n\n How do we compute the angle?\n\n Consider that the entire circle is 360°. The central angles are (360/n) per edge.\n\n If we take two edges from v2: one edge goes k edges clockwise (so k steps) and the other goes l edges counterclockwise (or vice versa). But note: the angle at v2 is an inscribed angle? Actually, we can relate the angle to the arc between v1 and v3.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n In the regular convex polygon, the interior angle at any vertex is ((n-2)/n)*180, but that is the internal angle of the polygon. However, note that the problem does not require the internal angle of the polygon but an arbitrary angle formed by two sides (which are chords of the circumcircle).\n\n Actually, the angle we are forming at v2 is determined by the two edges: from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. The angle can be either the interior angle or the exterior angle, but note: the problem states that the angle is formed by two sides (so the sides are the edges of the polygon? Not exactly: the sides are the lines connecting the vertices, but they can skip some vertices.\n\n However, note that the polygon is convex and the vertices are in clockwise order. The angle we are forming is the smaller angle between the two sides (since the polygon is convex, we are only considering the angle inside the polygon or the one that is less than 180?).\n\n Actually, the problem says: the angle is formed by the two sides (so the two rays from v2 through v1 and v3). In a convex polygon, the angle we are measuring is the one that lies inside the polygon? Or can it be the reflex angle? The problem states: \"the value\" and the examples: in the square, they consider 45 and 90.\n\n But note: the square example: \n   Input: 4 67 -> output 45 degrees (so |45-67|=22) is chosen over 90 (|90-67|=23).\n   Input: 4 68 -> output 90 degrees (so |90-68|=22) is chosen over 45 (|45-68|=23).\n\n So, the angle we consider is the one that is less than 180° (the smaller angle). Because if we take two adjacent edges (like the two edges of the square) then we get 90°, and if we take two edges that are separated by one edge (so the two opposite edges) then we get 45°.\n\n How to compute the angle for two points from v2?\n\n Let's fix vertex v2. Then, let the two other vertices be at positions (clockwise from v2) i and j (with i < j, say). Then the angle at v2 is determined by the arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\n Actually, we can use the fact that the entire circle is 360°. The central angles for the arcs between vertices are multiples of (360/n).\n\n The angle at v2 (the inscribed angle) subtended by the arc from v1 to v3 (not containing v2) is half the central angle of the arc opposite to the angle? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the law of cosines in",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex polygon such that the angle formed at the vertex (between the two sides connecting to the other two vertices) is as close as possible to a given target angle. The solution involves leveraging the geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently checking possible angles formed by their vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that in a regular convex polygon with `n` vertices, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is `360/n` degrees. The angle formed at any vertex `v2` by two other vertices `v1` and `v3` can be derived from the arcs between these vertices. The angle is determined by the number of edges between `v1` and `v2` and between `v2` and `v3`.\n\n2. **Insight**: The angle formed at vertex `v2` can be calculated based on the number of steps (edges) from `v2` to `v1` and from `v2` to `v3`. The angle is half the difference between the central angles subtended by the arcs opposite to the angle. \n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each vertex `v2`, we consider all possible pairs of vertices `v1` and `v3` such that they form an angle close to the target. However, checking all pairs for each vertex is computationally expensive for large `n`. Instead, we use a mathematical approach to compute potential angles and find the closest one without exhaustive checks.\n\n4. **Optimization**: The solution involves iterating over possible angles around the target angle, considering both smaller and larger angles, and selecting the one with the minimal absolute difference. The vertices are chosen based on the computed angles, ensuring efficiency even for large `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    total_angle = 360.0\n    central_angle = total_angle / n\n    \n    base_angle = a % 360.0\n    \n    if base_angle == 0:\n        base_angle += 0.1\n        \n    candidate_angles = []\n    candidate_vertices = []\n    \n    for k in range(1, n // 2 + 1):\n        angle_val = 180.0 - k * central_angle\n        if abs(angle_val - base_angle) < 1e-5:\n            candidate_angles.append((angle_val, k))\n            candidate_vertices.append((k, k+1, k+2))\n        elif abs(angle_val - base_angle) < 1e-5 * 10:\n            candidate_angles.append((angle_val, k))\n            candidate_vertices.append((k, k+1, k+2))\n            \n    if not candidate_angles:\n        angle_val2 = 180.0 + (360.0 - base_angle)\n        k_val = int(round((360.0 - base_angle) / central_angle))\n        if 1 <= k_val <= n-2:\n            candidate_angles.append((angle_val2, k_val))\n            candidate_vertices.append((k_val, k_val+1, k_val+2))\n            \n    best_angle_diff = float('inf')\n    best_vertices = None\n    \n    for i in range(len(candidate_angles)):\n        diff = abs(candidate_angles[i][0] - base_angle)\n        if diff < best_angle_diff:\n            best_angle_diff = diff\n            best_vertices = candidate_vertices[i]\n        elif diff == best_angle_diff:\n            if candidate_vertices[i][0] != best_vertices[0]:\n                continue\n            else:\n                best_vertices = candidate_vertices[i]\n                \n    if best_vertices is None:\n        angle_val2 = 180.0 + (360.0 - base_angle)\n        k_val = int(round((360.0 - base_angle) / central_angle))\n        if 1 <= k_val <= n-2:\n            candidate_vertices.append((k_val, k_val+1, k_val+2))\n            best_vertices = candidate_vertices[-1]\n            \n    v2 = best_vertices[0]\n    v1 = best_vertices[1]\n    v3 = best_vertices[2]\n    \n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n    \nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (target angle in degrees).\n\n2. **Central Angle Calculation**: The central angle between two adjacent vertices in the regular polygon is calculated as `360/n`.\n\n3. **Angle Adjustment**: The target angle is adjusted to handle cases where it might be zero or a multiple of 360 degrees.\n\n4. **Candidate Angles**: For each possible step count `k`, the angle formed by vertices separated by `k` edges is computed. The difference between this angle and the target angle is checked, and candidates with minimal differences are stored.\n\n5. **Vertex Selection**: The vertices corresponding to the closest angle are selected.
