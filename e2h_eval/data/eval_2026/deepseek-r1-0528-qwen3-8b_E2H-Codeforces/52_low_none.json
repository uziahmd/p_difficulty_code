Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with two integers: a and b.\n We start with `a` new candles. Each candle burns for 1 hour and then becomes a used candle.\n After burning, we can combine `b` used candles to make a new one.\n\n The process:\n   hours = 0\n   current_new_candles = a\n   current_used_candles = 0\n\n However, we can simulate by thinking of the total burning hours from the initial candles and then recycling.\n\n Steps:\n   We can use the initial `a` candles for `a` hours, and then we have `a` used candles.\n   Then, we can form `used_candles // b` new candles (where `used_candles` is the total used so far) and have `used_candles % b` leftover.\n\n But note: when we form a new candle, we burn it and then it becomes used. So we have to account for the new ones as well.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   candles = a\n   used = 0\n\n   However, we can use a while loop:\n\n   But note: the problem says \"for how many hours\", and we start with a new candles.\n\n   Another approach: we can calculate the total number of candles that will be burned.\n\n   Let x be the total number of candles that are burned (and hence become used). Then, the total candles we have is a, and we can also create more from the used ones.\n\n   We know that: \n        x = a + floor((x - a) / (b-1))   ? \n\n   Actually, we can think: \n        Initially, we have a candles -> burn a, then we have a used candles.\n        Then, we can make floor(a / b) new candles, and we have a % b used candles left.\n        Then we burn these floor(a / b) new candles, so we get additional floor(a / b) hours, and then we have (a % b + floor(a / b)) used candles.\n\n   This is similar to a process that continues until we don't have enough used candles to make a new one.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a formula:\n\n   Let total = a\n   Let used = a\n   Then, while used >= b:\n        new_candles = used // b\n        remaining_used = used % b\n        total += new_candles\n        used = remaining_used + new_candles\n\n   Then, the answer is total.\n\n   But note: in the example: \n        Input: 4 2\n        Step1: a=4, used=4 -> new_candles=4//2=2, remaining_used=0, total becomes 6, used becomes 0+2=2.\n        Step2: used=2 -> new_candles=2//2=1, remaining_used=0, total becomes 7, used becomes 0+1=1 -> which is less than b, so stop.\n\n   This matches the sample: 7.\n\n   However, let's check the second sample: 6 3\n        Start: a=6, used=6 -> new_candles=6//3=2, remaining_used=0, total=8, used=2.\n        Then: used=2 -> new_candles=0 (because 2<3), so total=8.\n\n   This also matches.\n\n   But wait, in the first sample, after the first step, we have 2 used candles, which we use to make 1 new candle. Then we burn that one, so we get 1 more hour, and then we have 1 used candle. So total is 4 (initial) + 2 (from first recycling) + 1 (from second recycling) = 7.\n\n   The above simulation does:\n\n        total = 4 (initial)\n        Then we add 2 from the first recycling -> 6, then we add 1 from the second recycling -> 7.\n\n   So the algorithm is:\n\n        total = a\n        current_used = a\n        while current_used >= b:\n            new_candles = current_used // b\n            remainder = current_used % b\n            total += new_candles\n            current_used = new_candles + remainder\n            # if current_used < b, we break\n\n        print(total)\n\n   However, note that we can also run the loop until current_used < b.\n\n   But what if b==1? The problem states that b>=2, so we don't have to worry about that.\n\n   Let's test with a=1, b=2: \n        total=1, current_used=1 -> since 1<2, we break. Output 1. Correct.\n\n   Another test: a=10, b=5\n        Step1: current_used=10 -> new_candles=10//5=",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The key observation here is that each candle burns for one hour and then becomes a used candle. These used candles can be combined in groups of `b` to create new candles, which can then be burned again. The process continues until there are not enough used candles left to form a new candle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with `a` new candles. Each candle provides one hour of light.\n2. **Recycling Used Candles**: After burning the initial candles, we have `a` used candles. These used candles can be converted into new candles at a rate of `b` used candles per new candle.\n3. **Iterative Process**: For each iteration, calculate how many new candles can be made from the current used candles. Add these new candles to the total hours and update the count of used candles (remaining used candles plus new candles made).\n4. **Termination Condition**: The process stops when the number of used candles is less than `b`, meaning no more new candles can be formed.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the burning and recycling process, ensuring that all possible hours are accounted for until no further candles can be made.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    total = a\n    used = a\n    while used >= b:\n        new_candles = used // b\n        remainder = used % b\n        total += new_candles\n        used = new_candles + remainder\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` (initial number of candles) and `b` (number of used candles needed to create a new candle).\n2. **Initialization**: `total` is initialized to `a` because each initial candle provides one hour of light. `used` is also set to `a` since all initial candles will be used after burning.\n3. **Loop**: The loop continues as long as there are enough used candles (`used >= b`) to form new candles.\n   - **New Candles Calculation**: The number of new candles is the integer division of `used` by `b`.\n   - **Remainder Handling**: The remainder from the division represents the unused candles that cannot form a new candle yet.\n   - **Update Total and Used**: The total hours are increased by the number of new candles. The `used` count is updated to the sum of new candles (which will burn out and become used) and any remaining unused candles.\n4. **Output**: Once the loop exits, the total hours stored in `total` is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem by iteratively recycling used candles into new ones until no more can be formed, ensuring the maximum number of hours is achieved.",
