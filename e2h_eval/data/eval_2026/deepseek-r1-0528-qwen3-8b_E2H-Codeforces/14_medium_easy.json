    "thought": "\n Okay, we know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10, which is the min of the number of 2s and 5s (but there are usually more 2s). So we count the number of 5s.\n\n Let f(n) = number of trailing zeros in n!.\n We know: \n   f(n) = n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ... \n\n Now, we are given an integer m (from 1 to 100000) and we need to find all positive integers n such that f(n) = m.\n\n However, note that the function f(n) is non-decreasing. Also, note that for a fixed m, there might be a contiguous range of n that have the same number of trailing zeros? Actually, no: the trailing zeros increase only when n is a multiple of 5. But note: once we get m zeros, then for a few numbers (until the next multiple of 5) the trailing zeros remain the same.\n\n Example: \n   f(4) = 0, f(5)=1, f(6)=1, f(7)=1, f(8)=1, f(9)=1, f(10)=2.\n\n So for m=1, the numbers are from 5 to 9.\n\n But note: what if m is 0? The problem says m>=1, so we don't have to worry about m=0.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial\" and m>=1.\n\n How do we solve?\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We need to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Actually, we can use binary search to find the minimal n such that f(n) >= m, and the minimal n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n 2. Then, the set of n with exactly m trailing zeros would be the integers between [L, R-1] where:\n      L = smallest n with f(n) >= m\n      R = smallest n with f(n) >= m+1\n\n    But note: it is possible that there is no n such that f(n)=m? Actually, the function f(n) increases by at least one at multiples of 5, but sometimes by more (if n is a multiple of 25, then it adds two, etc.). However, note that m is at least 1 and at most 100000, and the problem requires outputting the list of n for which f(n)=m.\n\n 3. However, it is guaranteed that for every m from 1 to 100000 there exists at least one n? Actually, no: consider m=100000. The maximum n we would need to consider is when n//5 + n//25 + ... >= 100000. The n for 100000 trailing zeros is about 400000 (because 400000//5 = 80000, then adding higher powers gives more). But note: the problem says m from 1 to 100000, so we assume that for each m in that range there is at least one n? Actually, the problem doesn't say that, but the example input m=1 has solutions.\n\n 4. But wait: sometimes there might be gaps. For example, if m is very large, say 100000, but the next jump (from n to n+1) might skip over m? Actually, the function f(n) is non-decreasing and increases by the number of times 5 divides (n+1) (or more precisely, the jump at n! to (n+1)! is the number of 5s in (n+1)). But note: we are counting the trailing zeros for n!, so when n is not a multiple of 5, f(n) = f(n-1). Only at multiples of 5, it increases.\n\n However, the jumps are by the multiplicity of 5 in n. For example, at 25, we add two zeros.\n\n So for m=1, we have n from 5 to 9 (which is 5 numbers). For m=2, we have n from 10 to 14. For m=3, n from 15 to 19. But wait, at 25 we jump from 24 to 25: \n   f(24) = 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 = 4\n   f(25) = 25//5 + 25//25 + 25//125 = 5 + 1 + 0 = 6\n\n So actually, from 20 to 24, the trailing zeros are 4 (since 20: 20//5=4, 20//25=0 -> 4; 21: same, ... until 24: same). Then at 25, it becomes 6. Therefore, there is no n with trailing zeros equal to 5.\n\n So the problem: for some m, there might be no n? Then our answer would be 0.\n\n Steps:\n\n   - We need to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m (call it low).\n   - We need to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1 (call it high).\n\n   Then, the n's that have exactly m zeros are the integers from low to high-1, provided that f(low) == m and f(high-1) == m.\n\n   But note: what if there is a gap? Actually, the condition is that the set of n with f(n) >= m is [low, ∞). And the set of n with f(n) >= m+1 is [high, ∞). Then the n's with exactly m zeros are [low, high-1] if f(low)==m and f(high-1)==m. However, we must ensure that for all n in [low, high-1], f(n)==m.\n\n   However, note: the function f(n) is constant on intervals between multiples of 5. So from low to the next multiple of 5 (exclusive) the value remains m, unless the next multiple of 5 causes a jump of more than one.\n\n   But note: we defined low as the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Then at low, we have f(low) >= m. Similarly, high is the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1, so f(high) >= m+1.\n\n   Now, what if there is a jump that skips m? Then there will be no n such that f(n)=m.\n\n   Example: m=5. We know that f(24)=4, f(25)=6. Then the smallest n with f(n)>=5 is 25. But then the numbers from 25 onward have at least 6 zeros. So we have no n with exactly 5 zeros.\n\n   Therefore, the set of n with exactly m zeros is the interval [low, high-1] only if f(low) == m. But note: it is possible that f(low) > m? Then we have no solution. Actually, by our definition of low, we have the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Then if f(low) == m, then low is the start. But if f(low) > m, then there is no n with f(n)=m.\n\n   Actually, we must check: if the smallest n with f(n)>=m has f(n)=m, then we have an interval. Otherwise, if the smallest n with f(n)>=m has f(n)>m, then there is no n with f(n)=m.\n\n   But note: the function f(n) is non-decreasing and increases by integers. So if the smallest n such that f(n)>=m has f(n)=m, then we have the interval. If it has f(n)=m+1 or more, then we have skipped m.\n\n   Alternatively, we can define:\n\n        low = smallest n such that f(n) >= m\n        Then, if f(low) != m, then there is no solution.\n\n   However, wait: what if m is 0? But m>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   But note: the example: m=5. \n        We want the smallest n such that f(n)>=5. \n        f(24)=4, f(25)=6 -> so low=25, and f(25)=6 !=5 -> then there is no n with f(n)=5.\n\n   So algorithm:\n\n        Step 1: Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. (using binary search)\n        Step 2: Check if f(low) == m. If not, then output 0.\n        Step 3: Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1. (again, using binary search)\n        Step 4: Then the numbers are from low to high-1.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not require us to output the numbers if there are none, so we output 0 and nothing else.\n\n   But wait: what if m=0? The problem says m>=1, so we don't handle m=0.\n\n   However, the problem says: \n        Input: integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000)\n\n   Example: \n        Input: 1 -> Output: 5\\n5 6 7 8 9\n\n   But note: the example output format: First print k (the number of values), then if k>0, print the k integers in increasing order.\n\n   So for m=5, we output:\n        0\n\n   But wait: what if m is very large? We have to consider that the range [low, high-1] might be very large? Actually, the problem says m up to 100000, and the n for m=100000 is about 400000 (as above). The numbers we output are from low to high-1, and the length of the interval is (high - low). But note: the problem does not require to output the entire list if the list is long? However, note that the problem says: \"print these k integers in increasing order\", meaning we have to output them all.\n\n   But wait: if the interval is large (say 100000 numbers) then printing 100000 numbers is acceptable? The problem constraints say m up to 100000, and the n for m=100000 is around 400000, and the interval for m=100000 might be 5 numbers? Actually, the trailing zeros increase by the number of 5 factors. So the length of the interval for a given m is at most 4 (because 5 consecutive numbers after a multiple of 5 will have the same trailing zeros, then at the next multiple of 5 the trailing zeros jump). Actually, no: the trailing zeros only change at multiples of 5, so the interval for a given m is at most 5 numbers? \n\n   Why 5? Because after a multiple of 5, the trailing zeros increase. But the jump size is the exponent of 5 in that number. However, the next jump might be at a multiple of 25, so we might skip several m values.\n\n   Example: m=5 -> no solution, so interval length 0.\n   m=6: \n        f(25)=6, then 26,27,28,29,30: \n        f(26)=6, f(27)=6, f(28)=6, f(29)=6, f(30)=7 (because 30 adds one 5, so 6+1=7). \n        So the numbers for m=6 are 25,26,27,28,29 -> 5 numbers.\n\n   But wait, what about m=1? \n        f(5)=1, f(6)=1, ... f(9)=1 -> 5 numbers.\n\n   So the maximum length of the interval is 5? \n\n   Why? Because the trailing zeros only change when n is a multiple of 5, and the next change is at the next multiple of 5. However, if the current n is a multiple of 5^k but not 5^(k+1), then the jump at n is k. Then the next multiple of 5 is n+5, which will add at least one 5 (so the trailing zeros will increase by at least one). Therefore, the trailing zeros remain the same for the next 4 numbers (if we are at n=5, then n=5,6,7,8,9: 5 numbers). \n\n   But note: the interval for a given m is the set of n such that the trailing zeros is m. The trailing zeros only change at multiples of 5, so the interval is from the first multiple of 5 (or non-multiple) that gives m zeros until the next multiple of 5 (exclusive) or until the next jump that would change the trailing zeros.\n\n   However, note that the jump at a multiple of 5 might be more than one, so the same trailing zeros might appear for fewer than 5 numbers? \n\n   Example: m=6. \n        The first n with f(n)=6 is 25. Then the next multiple of 5 is 30, and at 30 the trailing zeros become 7. So the numbers from 25 to 29 (inclusive) have 6 zeros. That's 5 numbers.\n\n   Example: m=7.\n        The first n with f(n)=7 is 30. Then the next multiple of 5 is 35, but at 30: \n            f(30) = 7, f(31)=7, f(32)=7, f(33)=7, f(34)=7, f(35)=8 (because 35 adds one 5 -> 7+1=8). \n        So numbers from 30 to 34: 5 numbers.\n\n   But wait, what if we have a jump of more than one? \n        Example: m=13. \n        Consider n=125: \n            f(124) = 124//5 + 124//25 + 124//125 = 24+4+0 = 28\n            f(125) = 125//5 + 125//25 + 125//125 = 25+5+1 = 31\n\n        So the trailing zeros jump from 28 (at 124) to 31 (at 125). Then what about 29 and 30? There is no n with trailing zeros 29 or 30.\n\n        Now, what if m=29? Then the smallest n with f(n)>=29 is 125 (since f(124)=28 <29, f(125)=31>=29). Then we check f(125)=31 !=29 -> no solution.\n\n        Similarly, m=30: smallest n with f(n)>=30 is 125 (f(125)=31>=30). Then the numbers with exactly 30 zeros are from 125 to the next jump (which is 130? but let's compute f(125)=31, so already at 125 we have 31 zeros. Then the next jump is at 130? Actually, we need to find the next n such that f(n)>=31? Actually, we have:\n\n            f(125)=31, then 126,127,128,129: still 31, then 130: \n                f(130) = 130//5 + 130//25 + 130//125 = 26 + 5 + 1 = 32.\n\n        So for m=30, we need the smallest n such that f(n)>=30 -> 125 (because 124 gives 28, 125 gives 31). Then we check: f(125)=31 !=30 -> no solution.\n\n        Similarly, m=31: \n            smallest n with f(n)>=31 is 125, and f(125)=31 -> valid.\n            Then we find the smallest n such that f(n)>=32: that is 130 (because 129: \n                129//5 = 25, 129//25=5, 129//125=1 -> 25+5+1=31, 130: 26+5+1=32.\n            Then the numbers are from 125 to 129 -> 5 numbers.\n\n   Therefore, the length of the interval is always 5, unless the jump is more than one and we are at the beginning of the interval? Actually, the length is the distance until the next multiple of 5 (exclusive) because the trailing zeros change only at multiples of 5.\n\n   However, note: the trailing zeros change by the multiplicity of 5 in the number. So the jump at n (if n is divisible by 5^k) is k. This jump can be more than one, so the same trailing zeros value might appear for fewer than 5 numbers? \n\n   Example: m=31: from 125 to 129: 5 numbers.\n\n   Example: m=32: \n        smallest n for 32: 130 (f(130)=32)\n        Then the next jump is at 135: \n            f(130)=32, f(131)=32, ... f(134)=32, f(135)=32 + (number of 5s in 135)= 135//5 + 135//25 + 135//125 = 27+5+1=33 (but wait, we are building from 130: we don't add the trailing zeros from scratch, we just add the new factor of 5 in 135. Actually, the formula is cumulative. The trailing zeros at 135 is the trailing zeros at 134 plus the number of 5s in 135. \n\n        But note: our function f(n) is defined as the total number of 5s in the prime factors of n!.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute f(135) by: 135//5 + 135//25 + 135//125 = 27 + 5 + 1 = 33.\n\n        So the numbers with 32 zeros are from 130 to 134: 5 numbers.\n\n   Now, consider a jump of two: \n        Example: m=29 -> no solution.\n\n   But wait, what if we have a jump of two and we are looking for the number just after the jump? \n\n        Example: n=24: trailing zeros=4, n=25: trailing zeros=6. Then for m=5: no solution.\n\n   So the key is: the trailing zeros function increases by the multiplicity of 5 in n (when n is a multiple of 5). Therefore, the same trailing zeros value appears for consecutive numbers until the next multiple of 5. The length of the interval for a given m is 5, except when the jump is more than one (then we skip some m values) and then the interval for the skipped m values is empty.\n\n   But note: the interval for a given m (if exists) is always 5 numbers? \n\n        Yes, because the trailing zeros function is constant on intervals [5k, 5k+4] (if we ignore the jumps). The jump happens at 5k, and then the next constant interval is [5k+1, 5k+4] and then at 5k+5 (which is 5*(k+1)) the next jump.\n\n   However, if the jump at 5k is more than one (say j), then the trailing zeros at 5k is f(5k-1) + j. Then the next constant interval (for the same trailing zeros) is only the numbers from 5k to 5k+j-1? \n\n        Let me clarify: \n          Let n0 = 5k, and let j = the exponent of 5 in n0 (so j = floor(log5(n0)) + 1? Actually, j is the number of times 5 divides n0.\n\n        Then, the trailing zeros at n0 is f(n0) = f(n0-1) + j.\n\n        Then, the trailing zeros at n0+1, n0+2, ... until the next multiple of 5 (n0+5) will be the same as at n0, because no new factor of 5 is added until then.\n\n        But wait: the trailing zeros are determined by the entire product. When we go from n0-1 to n0, we multiply by n0, which adds j factors of 5 and some factors of 2 (which are plenty). So the trailing zeros increase by j.\n\n        Then, the next time the trailing zeros change is at n0+5, because that's the next multiple of 5.\n\n        Therefore, the same trailing zeros value (which is f(n0)) will appear for the numbers from n0 to n0+4 (5 numbers). \n\n        However, if j>=2, then we skipped the trailing zeros values f(n0)-1, f(n0)-2, ... down to f(n0)-j+1. But note: the trailing zeros at n0-1 was f(n0)-j, and then we jumped to f(n0) at n0. So the values f(n0)-j+1 to f(n0)-1 are skipped.\n\n        But the problem: we are only concerned with a fixed m. \n\n        Example: j=2 (like 25). Then we skipped m=5 (if 5 was the value we skipped). \n\n        So the algorithm:\n\n          We are going to use binary search to find:\n\n            low_bound = smallest n such that f(n) >= m\n            high_bound = smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1\n\n          Then, if f(low_bound) != m, then there is no n with f(n)=m, so output 0.\n\n          Otherwise, the numbers are from low_bound to high_bound-1.\n\n          The length of the interval is (high_bound - low_bound) which is at most 5? \n\n          Why? Because the next jump is at the next multiple of 5, and the trailing zeros increase by the multiplicity of 5 at that multiple. But note: the next jump is at the next multiple of 5 (which is <= low_bound+4). However, the function f(n) is constant for n in [low_bound, next_jump-1]. And the next_jump is the next multiple of 5 after low_bound? Not necessarily: the next jump is the next multiple of 5 that is divisible by 5, but note: the jump condition is when n is divisible by 5. \n\n          Actually, the next jump is at the next multiple of 5, which is (floor(low_bound/5)+1)*5. Then the interval [low_bound, (floor(low_bound/5)+1)*5 - 1] is the maximal interval where the trailing zeros remain constant. However, we break the interval at the next multiple of 5, but we also break at the point where the trailing zeros become m+1 (if that happens earlier). \n\n          But note: the trailing zeros become m+1 at high_bound, which is the smallest n such that f(n)>=m+1. Since the trailing zeros only change at multiples of 5, high_bound must be a multiple of 5. And similarly, low_bound must be a multiple of 5? Not necessarily: the smallest n such that f(n)>=m might be a multiple of 5, but if m is achieved at a non-multiple of 5, then low_bound is the first multiple of 5 that gives at least m? Actually, no: the trailing zeros are the same for the entire block until the next multiple of 5. \n\n          However, the trailing zeros function is constant between multiples of 5. So if m is achieved, then the entire block from the first occurrence of m (which is a multiple of 5) to the next multiple of 5 minus one will have the same m.\n\n          But note: we found low_bound as the smallest n such that f(n)>=m. Then the entire block [low_bound, high_bound-1] is the set of n with f(n)=m.\n\n          How to compute f(n): \n            def trailing_zeros(n):\n                count = 0\n                divisor = 5\n                while divisor <= n:\n                    count += n // divisor\n                    divisor *= 5\n\n          Then we do:\n\n            low_bound = smallest_n_ge_m(m)\n            if trailing_zeros(low_bound) != m:\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                high_bound = smallest_n_ge_m(m+1)\n                k = high_bound - low_bound\n                print(k)\n                # Then we need to print the k numbers: from low_bound to high_bound-1.\n\n          But note: the problem says m from 1 to 100000. The n we are dealing with can be as large as about 5*m (since each multiple of 5 adds at least one zero). The maximum n we need to consider for m=100000 is about 400000 (actually, the exact value is found by binary search).\n\n          However, the binary search for n: we need to search in the range [0, maybe 5*m*5] (because we know that n is at least 5*m, but actually the minimal n for m zeros is about 4*m (by the formula, we have n/5 + n/25 + ... ~ n/4). So we can set the high bound for binary search to, say, 5*m*5 (500000) which is safe for m=100000.\n\n          But note: the minimal n for m zeros is approximately 5*m (because n//5 >= m => n>=5*m). However, because of the higher powers, we can set high_bound_initial = 5 * m * 5 (or use an exponential backoff). But 5*m might be 500000, and we are doing binary search from 0 to 500000 (for m=100000) which is 9 iterations.\n\n          However, the problem says m up to 100000, and 500000 is acceptable.\n\n          But note: the minimal n for m zeros might be less than 5*m? Actually, the formula f(n)=n/5+n/25+... is less than n/4 (geometric series). So n must be at least 4*m. But we set the high_bound_initial to 5*m*5 = 2500000? Actually, we can set high_bound_initial to 5*m (which is 500000) but then if m=100000, 5*m=500000, and we know that f(500000) is about 500000/5 + 500000/25 + ... = 100000 + 20000 + 4000 + 800 + 160 + 32 + ... which is much more than 100000. So we need to set a higher initial high_bound? \n\n          Actually, we can use binary search from 0 to, say, 5*m (which is 500000) but that might be too low because the trailing zeros for 500000 is 124999 (I think). Wait, let me compute:\n\n          f(500000) = 500000//5 + 500000//25 + 500000//125 + 500000//625 + ... \n          = 100000 + 20000 + 4000 + 800 + 160 + 32 + 6 + 1 = 124999\n\n          So for m=100000, we need an n such that f(n)=100000. The minimal n for 100000 zeros is less than 500000.\n\n          We can set high_bound_initial to 5*m (which is 500000) and then use binary search. But note: the minimal n for 100000 zeros is about 400000 (because 400000/5 = 80000, then 400000/25=16000, 400000/125=3200, 400000/625=640, 400000/3125=128, etc. -> 80000+16000+3200+640+128+25+5= 80000+16000=96000; 96000+3200=99200; 99200+640=99840; 99840+128=99968; 99968+25=99993; 99993+5=99998. So 400000 gives 99998 zeros, which is less than 100000. Then we need to go to 400000 + ... until we get 100000.\n\n          Actually, we can use the binary search to find the minimal n such that f(n) >= m.\n\n          Steps for binary search:\n\n            low_val = 0\n            high_val = 5*m   # but wait, for m=100000, 5*m=500000, but we saw that 500000 gives 124999, which is way above. We can set high_val = 5*m (or even 5*m is safe because the minimal n for m zeros is at most 5*m? Actually, the minimal n is the smallest n such that f(n)>=m, and since f(5*m) = (5*m)//5 + (5*m)//25 + ... = m + m/4 + m/25 + ... which is greater than m, so we can set high_val=5*m.\n\n          However, for m=1, 5*m=5, which is correct.\n\n          Algorithm for smallest_n_ge_m(m):\n\n            low = 0\n            high = 5*m   # we know that f(5*m) >= m (actually much more)\n\n            while low < high:\n                mid = (low+high)//2\n                zeros = trailing_zeros(mid)\n                if zeros < m:\n                    low = mid+1\n                else:\n                    high = mid\n\n            return low\n\n          Then, we do the same for m+1.\n\n          But note: the problem says m up to 100000, and the numbers we are dealing with are up to 500000, which is acceptable for a binary search (about 19 iterations for 500000, and each iteration computes trailing_zeros which runs in O(log_5(n)) which is about 7-8 iterations for n=500000).\n\n          However, we have to do two binary searches (for m and for m+1). Each binary search takes about 19 * (log5(500000)) operations, which is about 19 * 7 = 133 calls to trailing_zeros. And trailing_zeros uses base-5 logarithm (dividing by 5 until 0). This is efficient.\n\n          But note: the trailing_zeros function for n=500000: \n            while divisor <= n: \n                divisor starts at 5, then 25, 125, ... until divisor > n.\n\n          The number of iterations is floor(log5(n)) + 1, which for n=500000 is about 7 (because 5^7=78125, 5^8=390625, 5^9=1953125 which is >500000). So 7 iterations.\n\n          Then total operations: 2 * 19 * 7 = 266, which is acceptable.\n\n          Now, the output: \n            If we found an interval, we have to output k = high_bound - low_bound, and then the k numbers from low_bound to high_bound-1.\n\n          But note: k can be 0,1,2,3,4,5? Actually, we know the interval is contiguous and the trailing zeros change only at multiples of 5, so the interval for a fixed m is either empty or a contiguous set of numbers of length 5? \n\n          Actually, the length of the interval is the number of integers from low_bound to high_bound-1, which is (high_bound - low_bound). \n\n          But note: the next jump (the next multiple of 5) is at most 5 away (unless the current low_bound is a multiple of a higher power, but the next jump is the next multiple of 5, which is low_bound + (5 - (low_bound % 5)) if low_bound%5 !=0, but wait: if low_bound is a multiple of 5, then the next jump is low_bound+5. However, we defined low_bound as the smallest n with f(n)>=m, and if m is achieved at a multiple of 5, then the next jump is at low_bound+5, so the interval is [low_bound, low_bound+4] (5 numbers). \n\n          But if m is achieved at a non-multiple of 5? Actually, the trailing zeros only change at multiples of 5, so the value m must be achieved at a multiple of 5? \n\n          Example: m=1. The smallest n with f(n)=1 is 5 (which is a multiple of 5). Then the interval is [5,9] (5 numbers).\n\n          Example: m=0 -> not applicable.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal n (low_bound) for which f(n)=m must be a multiple of 5. Then the next jump is at low_bound+5, so high_bound = low_bound+5 (the smallest n with f(n)>=m+1 is low_bound+5, because at low_bound+5 the trailing zeros increase by the multiplicity of 5 in low_bound+5, which is at least 1). \n\n          But wait: what if the jump at low_bound+5 is more than one? Then the trailing zeros at low_bound+5 is f(low_bound) + (jump) which is >= f(low_bound)+1, but we are looking for m+1. So high_bound might be less than low_bound+5? \n\n          Example: low_bound=25, m=6. Then the next jump is at 25 (already) and the next jump is at 30. But wait, we are looking for the next jump (the next multiple of 5) which is 30. However, at 30, the trailing zeros jump from 6 (at 29) to 7 (at 30). So the smallest n with f(n)>=7 is 30. Then the interval for m=6 is [25,29] (5 numbers). \n\n          But note: the jump at 25 was from 4 to 6 (skipping 5). Then the next jump is at 30 (from 6 to 7). \n\n          So the interval for m=6 is [25,29] (5 numbers). \n\n          Now, what if the jump at the next multiple of 5 (after the one that achieved m) is more than one? \n\n          Example: m=31. \n            low_bound = 125 (which is 5^3). The trailing zeros at 125: 31.\n            The next jump is at 130: \n                trailing_zeros(130)",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding all such \\( n \\) values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of the primes 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is primarily governed by the number of times 5 appears in the prime factorization of the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This count is calculated as \\( n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + \\ldots \\) until the division yields zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that the count of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is at least \\( m \\). This is done using binary search over possible values of \\( n \\). Similarly, we find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the trailing zeroes count is at least \\( m+1 \\).\n\n3. **Checking Valid Intervals**: If the smallest \\( n \\) with trailing zeroes count \\( \\geq m \\) has exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes, then all integers from this \\( n \\) up to the smallest \\( n \\) with trailing zeroes count \\( \\geq m+1 \\) minus one will have exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The count of such integers is the difference between these two bounds. If the smallest \\( n \\) does not have exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes, no such \\( n \\) exists.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef smallest_n_ge_m(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        zeros = trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if zeros < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    try:\n        m = int(data[0])\n    except Exception:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    low_bound = smallest_n_ge_m(m)\n    zeros_low = trailing_zeros(low_bound)\n    if zeros_low != m:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    high_bound = smallest_n_ge_m(m + 1)\n    count = high_bound - low_bound\n    print(count)\n    if count > 0:\n        numbers = [str(i) for i in range(low_bound, high_bound)]\n        print(\" \".join(numbers))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **trailing_zeros(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the divisor exceeds \\( n \\).\n\n2. **smallest_n_ge_m(m)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that the trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is at least \\( m \\). The search space is set from 0 to \\( 5 \\times m \\), leveraging the fact that \\( n \\) must be at least \\( 5 \\times m \\) to achieve \\( m \\) trailing zeroes.\n\n3. **main()**: The main function reads the input \\( m \\), computes the bounds using `smallest_n_ge_m`, checks if the lower bound has exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes, and then prints the count of valid integers along with them if they exist. The valid integers are those from the lower bound to the upper bound minus one.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using binary search and leverages mathematical insights about factorial trailing zeroes to solve the problem within feasible computational limits.",
