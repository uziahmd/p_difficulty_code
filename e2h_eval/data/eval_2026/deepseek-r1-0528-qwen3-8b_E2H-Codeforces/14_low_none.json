He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeros is determined by the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of n!.\n\n The function for the number of trailing zeros in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n However, the problem asks: for a given m (number of trailing zeros), how many positive integers n have exactly m trailing zeros?\n\n Note: The trailing zeros in factorial increase in steps. For example, \n   n! has Z(n) trailing zeros. Then (n+1)! has at least Z(n) trailing zeros. But sometimes it increases.\n\n Observation: \n   Let f(n) = number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\n   We are to find all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n   However, note that as n increases, f(n) is non-decreasing. So for a fixed m, the n's for which f(n)=m form a consecutive range (if any) or none.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"exactly m zeroes\", so we need to find all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n   However, consider: \n     m=1: \n        f(5)=1, f(6)=1, f(7)=1, f(8)=1, f(9)=1, f(10)=2.\n        So n from 5 to 9 have exactly 1 trailing zero.\n\n   So the output for m=1 is: \n        First print k (which is 5), then the numbers 5,6,7,8,9.\n\n   But what if there are no n such that f(n)=m? Then we output 0.\n\n   How do we approach?\n\n   Step 1: Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Actually, we are interested in the n for which f(n) = m.\n\n   Alternatively, we can find:\n      Let L(m) be the smallest n such that f(n) >= m, and R(m) be the largest n such that f(n) < m+1? \n\n   Actually, we want:\n      All n such that m == f(n)\n\n   But note: f(n) is constant over an interval. The value m might be achieved by a contiguous set of n's.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Find the lower bound: the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. However, note that we require exactly m.\n\n   2. We can also find the upper bound: the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1. Then the n's that have exactly m trailing zeros are from the lower bound (the first n where f(n)>=m) but wait: we require f(n)==m.\n\n   However, note that the condition for having exactly m zeros is that n must be less than the first n where the zeros become m+1, and at least the first n where the zeros become m (but note: it's possible that the zeros jump from below m to above m? Actually, the zeros only increase when n is a multiple of a power of 5. \n\n   But note: the zeros function is non-decreasing and increases by the number of factors of 5 in n (when n is added). \n\n   Alternate approach:\n\n   We can define:\n      Let L = the smallest n such that f(n) >= m.\n      Let R = the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n   Then, the set of n with f(n)=m is the set of n in [L, R-1] (if we assume that once we hit m+1, then from R onward we have at least m+1, and from L to R-1 we have exactly m? Not exactly: because it's possible that between L and R-1, the zeros remain m, and at R the zeros become at least m+1.\n\n   However, note that the zeros function increases by the number of factors of 5 in n. It is possible that when we go from n to n+1, the zeros might increase by more than 1? Actually, no: the zeros increase by the number of factors of 5 in the number (n+1). But note: we are considering consecutive n. For example, when n=24, f(24)=4; n=25, f(25)=6. So from 24 to 25, zeros jump from 4 to 6. Then for m=5, there is no n such that f(n)=5.\n\n   Therefore, we must check the entire range [L,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding all such \\( n \\) values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the exponent of 10 in its prime factorization, which is the product of the exponents of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is dictated by the exponent of 5 in \\( n! \\). This can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n2. **Finding Valid \\( n \\) Values**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find all \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) = m \\). The key observation here is that \\( Z(n) \\) is a non-decreasing function. Therefore, all valid \\( n \\) values will form a contiguous range if they exist.\n3. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To efficiently locate the smallest \\( n \\) where \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\) (lower bound) and the smallest \\( n \\) where \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\) (upper bound), we use binary search. The valid \\( n \\) values lie between these two bounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    m = int(data[0])\n    \n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * (m + 1)\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z_mid = zeros(mid)\n        if z_mid < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n            \n    left_bound = low\n    \n    high = 5 * (m + 2)\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z_mid = zeros(mid)\n        if z_mid < m + 1:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n            \n    right_bound = low\n    \n    if left_bound >= right_bound:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = right_bound - left_bound\n        print(k)\n        numbers = list(range(left_bound, right_bound))\n        print(\" \".join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function `zeros(n)`**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the divisor exceeds \\( n \\).\n2. **Binary Search for Lower Bound**: The first binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\). This sets the left boundary of the range where \\( Z(n) = m \\).\n3. **Binary Search for Upper Bound**: The second binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\). This sets the right boundary of the range where \\( Z(n) = m \\).\n4. **Output Handling**: If the left boundary is greater than or equal to the right boundary, it means no \\( n \\) exists with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes, so we output 0. Otherwise, we output the count of valid \\( n \\) values and the list of these values from the left boundary to one less than the right boundary.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the range of \\( n \\) values using binary search, leveraging the properties of the trailing zero count function to solve the problem in logarithmic time relative to \\( n \\).",
