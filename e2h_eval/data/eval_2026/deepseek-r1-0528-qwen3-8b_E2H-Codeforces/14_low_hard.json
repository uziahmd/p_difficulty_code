He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10, which is the minimum of the number of 2s and 5s. Since there are usually more 2s than 5s, we count the number of 5s.\n\n The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n Now, we are given an integer m (from 1 to 100000) and we need to find all positive integers n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n However, note: the problem asks for the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n Observation:\n   The function Z(n) is non-decreasing. For example:\n     Z(0)=0, Z(1)=0, Z(2)=0, Z(3)=0, Z(4)=0, Z(5)=1, Z(6)=1, ... until Z(9)=1, then Z(10)=2, etc.\n\n   But note: the sample input m=1 gives output 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9.\n\n   Therefore, we are to find the set of n for which Z(n) = m.\n\n   However, note that Z(n) doesn't necessarily jump by one at multiples of 5. For example:\n        Z(5) = 1, Z(10)=2, but what about between 5 and 10? \n        Actually, from n=5 to n=9: Z(n)=1, and from n=10 to n=14: Z(n)=2.\n\n   But wait: \n        n=5: Z(5)=1\n        n=6: Z(6)=1 (since 6! = 720 -> one trailing zero)\n        n=7: Z(7)=1\n        n=8: Z(8)=1\n        n=9: Z(9)=1\n        n=10: Z(10)=2\n\n   So for a fixed m, we are looking for all n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n   However, note that the same m might appear for multiple consecutive n. We cannot have two different n with the same m arbitrarily far apart because the zeros increase as n increases.\n\n   How to solve?\n\n   Step 1: Find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m (this is the lower bound for the starting point of the block where zeros become m).\n   Step 2: Then, we want the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1 (the next block). Then the numbers we are looking for are from the lower bound to one less than the upper bound.\n\n   But note: the condition is exactly m zeros. So:\n\n        Let L = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n        Let R = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1.\n\n        Then the numbers n that satisfy Z(n)=m are the integers from L to R-1, inclusive.\n\n   However, we must check: \n        Example m=1: \n            Find smallest n with Z(n)>=1 -> n=5 (Z(5)=1)\n            Find smallest n with Z(n)>=2 -> n=10 (Z(10)=2)\n\n            Then the numbers are from 5 to 9 (inclusive). \n\n        Example m=0:\n            Then we want n such that Z(n)=0. \n            The smallest n with Z(n)>=0 is 0, but note positive integers. We consider positive integers, so n>=1.\n            Actually, for n=1 to 4: Z(n)=0.\n            Then the smallest n with Z(n)>=1 is 5. So the numbers are from 1 to 4.\n\n        But the problem states m>=1, so we don't have to handle m=0. However, the problem says m from 1 to 100000.\n\n   But wait: the example input was ['1', '5'] meaning that the input is a single integer m.\n\n   However, note the sample output format: \n        First print k (the number of values) and then the k integers in increasing order.\n\n   But note: what if there are no n such that Z(n)=m? \n        Actually, since Z(n) is non-decreasing and goes to infinity as n increases, for any m there is at least one n with Z(n)=m? Not necessarily.\n\n        Example: m=0 is not given, but for m>=1, we know that for n=5*m (or some multiple) we will eventually get to m zeros.\n\n        However, consider: is",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of \\( n \\) values that meet the given condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is essentially the number of times 5 appears in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Finding the Range for \\( n \\)**:\n   - **Lower Bound (L)**: The smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\).\n   - **Upper Bound (R)**: The smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\).\n   - The valid \\( n \\) values are those in the range \\([L, R-1]\\), inclusive, where \\( Z(n) = m \\).\n\n3. **Efficiency Consideration**: Directly computing \\( Z(n) \\) for large \\( n \\) (up to very high values due to \\( m \\) being up to 100,000) is feasible using a loop that sums the integer divisions by increasing powers of 5 until the power exceeds \\( n \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    try:\n        m = int(data[0])\n    except Exception:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    def zeros_func(x):\n        count = 0\n        divisor = 5\n        while divisor <= x:\n            count += x // divisor\n            divisor *= 5\n        return count\n\n    L = None\n    R = None\n\n    # Find the smallest n such that zeros_func(n) >= m\n    low, high = 0, 5 * m\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z_mid = zeros_func(mid)\n        if z_mid < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            L = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    if L is None:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Find the smallest n such that zeros_func(n) >= m+1\n    low, high = L, 5 * m * 2\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z_mid = zeros_func(mid)\n        if z_mid < m + 1:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            R = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    if R is None:\n        R = L\n\n    start = L\n    end = R - 1\n\n    if start > end:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = end - start + 1\n        print(k)\n        if k > 0:\n            numbers = list(range(start, end + 1))\n            print(\" \".join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of a single integer \\( m \\), which represents the required number of trailing zeroes.\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**:\n   - **Lower Bound (L)**: Using binary search, we find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\). The search space is between 0 and \\( 5m \\) (a safe upper bound).\n   - **Upper Bound (R)**: Similarly, we find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\). The search space starts from \\( L \\) to \\( 10m \\) (another safe upper bound).\n3. **Output**: The valid \\( n \\) values are all integers from \\( L \\) to \\( R-1 \\). If no such values exist (i.e., \\( L \\) is greater than \\( R-1 \\)), the output is 0. Otherwise, we print the count of such values followed by the values themselves in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the range of \\( n \\) values using binary search, leveraging the non-decreasing nature of the \\( Z(n) \\) function to ensure correctness and optimal performance.",
