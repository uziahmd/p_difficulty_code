    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The problem states that the plate is a rectangle of size w x h (rows x columns).\n We are to add k gilded rings. The first ring goes along the edge, the second 2 cells away, etc.\n\n For the i-th ring (starting at i=1), the ring is drawn on the inner rectangle of size:\n   w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n   h_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n But note: if we subtract 4*(i-1) from both dimensions, then the ring has width 1 cell.\n\n How many cells does the i-th ring have?\n The ring is the border of an (w_i) x (h_i) rectangle. However, note that the problem says the ring has width 1.\n\n The total number of cells in the border of a rectangle of size a x b is:\n   If a >= 3 and b >= 3: \n        top and bottom: 2 * b\n        left and right: 2 * (a - 2)   [because the corners are counted twice]\n\n So total for the border = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n But wait: let's break down a 3x3 (which is the smallest):\n   Without any subtraction: the entire 3x3 has a border of 8 cells.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: \n   For a rectangle of size a x b, the border has:\n        top row: b\n        bottom row: b\n        left column (excluding the two corners already counted): a - 2\n        right column: a - 2\n\n   So: 2*b + 2*(a-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n However, note that the problem defines the i-th ring as the border of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)).\n But if at some point the inner rectangle becomes too small (like 0 or negative) then we cannot draw the ring.\n\n According to the input constraints: \n   k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n So for the i-th ring, the inner rectangle has dimensions:\n   w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n   h_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n But note: we must ensure that the ring is drawn only if the inner rectangle has at least 3x3? Actually, the problem says the first ring is the edge, so the first ring uses the entire plate which is w x h (at least 3x3). Then the next ring requires subtracting 4, so we need w>=7 and h>=7 for the second ring.\n\n However, the constraint on k ensures that we don't get an invalid ring. Specifically, the maximum k is such that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is non-negative and at least 1x1? Actually, the problem says the ring is drawn for the inner rectangle of size (w-4*(k-1)) x (h-4*(k-1)). The condition for the existence of the ring is that the inner rectangle must be at least 3x3? Let's check:\n\n The formula for the border of a rectangle of size a x b (with a,b>=3) is 2*a+2*b-4.\n\n But what if the inner rectangle is 1x1? Then the border would be 1 (if we consider a single cell as a ring of width 1, but actually the problem defines the ring as the border of the inner rectangle. For a 1x1, there is no border (the border of a 1x1 is the cell itself, but then the ring would have to be drawn as the entire cell? However, the problem states that the ring has width 1. Actually, the drawing process is defined by the edges.\n\n But note the example: the first ring is the edge of the plate. The plate is at least 3x3. The second ring is 2 cells away from the edge, so the inner rectangle is (w-4) x (h-4). \n\n However, the problem says the first ring goes along the edge, the second 2 cells away, etc.\n\n Important: the problem states that k is at least 1 and at most floor((min(n,m)+1)/4). \n\n Example: \"3 3 1\" -> output 8.\n\n Let's compute for the first ring (k=1) of a 3x3:\n   w_i = 3, h_i = 3.\n   Number of cells = 2*3 + 2*3 - 4 = 6+6-4 = 8.\n\n Now, what if k=2? Then we would have:\n   w_i = 3 - 4*(1) = -1 -> which is negative. But the constraint on k says k is at most floor((min(3,3)+1)/4) = floor((3+1)/4)=floor(4/4)=1. So k=2 is not allowed for 3x3.\n\n So we don't have to worry about negative dimensions because k is bounded.\n\n However, note: the problem says the ring is drawn for the inner rectangle of size (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)). We must ensure that the inner rectangle has positive dimensions and at least 3x3? Actually, the problem doesn't specify, but note that the ring is defined as the border of the inner rectangle. The border of a rectangle requires the rectangle to have at least 1x1, but if it is 1x1 then the border is just that one cell? But wait, the problem says the ring has width 1. \n\n However, the problem states: \"the first one should go along the edge of the plate\", meaning the entire outer border. Then the second one is 2 cells away, so the inner rectangle is (w-4) x (h-4). \n\n The example: \"7 9 2\" -> output 40.\n\n For the first ring (k=1) of 7x9:\n   Cells = 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 32.\n\n For the second ring (k=2) of 7x9:\n   Inner rectangle: (7-4) x (9-4) = 3x5.\n   Cells = 2*3 + 2*5 - 4 = 6+10-4 = 12.\n\n Total = 32 + 12 = 44, but the example output is 40.\n\n Wait, why 40?\n\n Let me re-read the problem: \n   \"the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — 2 cells away from the edge and so on.\"\n\n And the formal definition: \n   the i-th ring should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1)) x (h - 4(i-1)).\n\n But note: the second ring is drawn 2 cells away from the edge. That means we remove one ring from the outside. The entire plate is 7x9.\n\n The first ring (outermost) uses the outer border. Then the second ring is drawn 2 cells away, meaning we start from the second cell from the edge and go inward. However, the problem says the ring has width 1.\n\n How is the second ring drawn?\n   The second ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (7-4) x (9-4) = 3x5. But wait, the example output for two rings is 40, not 44.\n\n Let me recalc: \n   First ring: 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4 = 32.\n   Second ring: 2*3+2*5-4 = 6+10-4 = 12.\n   Total 32+12=44.\n\n But the example input \"7 9 2\" gives output 40.\n\n Alternatively, let me look at the example: \n   Input: ['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n   Output: ['8', '28', '40']\n\n   For 7x9 and k=1: 28, but 32 != 28.\n\n So I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\n Let me reexamine the example: \n   The example input \"7 9 1\" gives 28.\n\n   Using the formula: 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14+18-4 = 32, but expected is 28.\n\n What's going on?\n\n Alternative interpretation: \n   The problem says: the ring is the border of the inner rectangle. But note that the entire plate is 7x9, and the first ring is the outer border. However, the example output for 7x9 and k=1 is 28.\n\n Let me count the outer border of a 7x9 grid manually:\n\n   Top and bottom: 9 cells each -> 18\n   Left and right: the middle part (without the corners) is 7-2 = 5 cells for the left and right. So left and right: 2 * 5 = 10.\n\n   Total: 18 + 10 = 28.\n\n So the formula for the border of a rectangle a x b is: \n   top and bottom: 2 * b\n   left and right: 2 * (a - 2)   [because the corners are shared]\n\n   Therefore: 2*b + 2*(a-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n But wait, for a=7, b=9: 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14+18-4 = 32, but manual count is 28.\n\n Why the discrepancy?\n\n Let me break down the manual count again:\n\n   The top row: 9 cells (from column1 to column9)\n   The bottom row: 9 cells (from column1 to column9)\n   The left side: from row2 to row6 (because row1 and row7 are already counted in top and bottom) -> 5 cells.\n   The right side: similarly 5 cells.\n\n   So total: 9 (top) + 9 (bottom) + 5 (left) + 5 (right) = 28.\n\n But the formula 2*a + 2*b - 4 for a=7, b=9: \n   = 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 32.\n\n Why is the formula giving 32? \n\n The standard formula for the perimeter of a rectangle (if we were counting edges, not cells) is 2*(a+b). But here we are counting cells.\n\n Actually, the border of a grid has:\n   Top: b cells\n   Bottom: b cells\n   Left: a-2 cells (excluding the two corners which are already in top and bottom)\n   Right: a-2 cells\n\n So total: 2*b + 2*(a-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n But wait, the grid has a rows and b columns. The top row: b cells, bottom row: b cells, and the sides: from row index 1 to a-2 (so a-2 rows) and each side has 1 cell per row? Actually, no: the left side is from the first column to the second last row? \n\n Actually, the grid has a rows and b columns. The top row is row0 (0-indexed) and has b cells. The bottom row is row (a-1) and has b cells. The left side is from row1 to row (a-2) and at the first column: that's a-2 cells. Similarly for the right side.\n\n So the total is: 2*b + 2*(a-2).\n\n Now, for a=7, b=9: 2*9 + 2*(7-2) = 18 + 10 = 28.\n\n But note: 2*a + 2*b - 4 = 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4=32, which is different.\n\n So the correct formula is: 2*b + 2*(a-2) = 2*b + 2*a - 4.\n\n This is the same as 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n Wait, that is the same! 2*a + 2*b - 4 is indeed the same as 2*b + 2*a - 4.\n\n But then why did I get 32 and the manual count got 28? \n\n Let me do the math for 7x9:\n\n   2*a + 2*b - 4 = 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 32.\n\n But the manual count was 28.\n\n There's a contradiction.\n\n Let me break down the manual count again:\n\n   Top row: 9 cells (b=9)\n   Bottom row: 9 cells (b=9)\n   Left side: from row1 to row5 (that's 5 rows) -> 5 cells (because we skip the top and bottom rows)\n   Right side: also 5 cells.\n\n   Total: 9+9+5+5 = 28.\n\n But the formula 2*a + 2*b - 4 = 2*7+2*9-4 = 32.\n\n Alternatively, if we use the alternative breakdown: \n   Top: 9, Bottom: 9, Left: 5, Right: 5 -> 28.\n\n How does this relate to the formula?\n\n   Formula: 2*(a) + 2*(b) - 4.\n\n   But note: the entire border has 2*(a+b) - 4, because the four corners are counted twice.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think: \n      The border is the entire outer layer. The entire grid has w*h cells. The inner grid (without the border) is (a-2)*(b-2). Then the border is w*h - (a-2)*(b-2). \n\n   For a=7, b=9: \n        total cells = 7*9 = 63\n        inner grid = (7-2)*(9-2) = 5*7 = 35\n        border = 63 - 35 = 28.\n\n So the border is 28.\n\n Now, the formula 2*a + 2*b - 4 = 2*7+2*9-4=32 is not matching.\n\n The correct way to compute the border by the rectangle method is: \n        top: b\n        bottom: b\n        left: a-2\n        right: a-2\n\n        total = 2*b + 2*(a-2) = 2*b + 2*a - 4.\n\n        But wait, 2*b + 2*a - 4 is the same as 2*(a+b) - 4.\n\n        For 7x9: 2*(7+9)-4 = 2*16-4 = 32-4=28.\n\n Ah! I see: 2*(a+b)-4 is the same as 2*a+2*b-4.\n\n So the formula is correct.\n\n Now, for the second ring (k=2) of 7x9:\n\n   The inner rectangle is (7-4) x (9-4) = 3x5.\n\n   Then the border of 3x5: \n        Using the same method: 2*(3+5)-4 = 2*8-4 = 16-4=12.\n\n   Then total for two rings: 28 (first ring) + 12 (second ring) = 40.\n\n But wait, the example output for \"7 9 2\" is 40.\n\n And for the first ring (k=1) of 7x9: 28.\n\n However, the example input \"7 9 1\" is provided and the output is 28.\n\n And the example input \"7 9 2\" is provided and the output is 40.\n\n So the solution is:\n\n   For i from 0 to k-1 (since we have k rings), the i-th ring (0-indexed) is drawn on the rectangle:\n        a = w - 4*i\n        b = h - 4*i\n\n   But note: the problem says the first ring is i=1 (which is our i=0). The second ring is i=2 (our i=1).\n\n   However, the problem says: the first ring is the edge, so we subtract 4*(0) for the first ring, then 4*(1) for the second.\n\n   Then the number of cells for the i-th ring (0-indexed) is: \n        if a <= 0 or b <= 0: then this ring doesn't exist, but k is bounded so we assume a>=3 and b>=3 for the first ring? Actually, the constraint on k ensures that we don't go below.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the ring to exist is that the inner rectangle must be at least 1x1? Actually, the problem says the ring is drawn for the inner rectangle of size (w-4*(i)) x (h-4*(i)) for the (i+1)-th ring. But wait, the problem indexes the rings starting at 1.\n\n   In our code, we are going to iterate for each ring from 0 to k-1.\n\n   For each ring i (0-indexed), the rectangle dimensions are:\n        a_i = w - 4*i\n        b_i = h - 4*i\n\n   But note: the first ring (i=0) uses the original plate, and the second (i=1) uses the plate minus 4*1.\n\n   However, the example: \n        w=7, h=9, k=2.\n\n        Ring0: i=0 -> a0=7, b0=9 -> cells0 = 2*(7+9)-4 = 28.\n        Ring1: i=1 -> a1=3, b1=5 -> cells1 = 2*(3+5)-4 = 12.\n\n        Total = 28+12 = 40.\n\n   But wait, the problem says the first ring goes along the edge. Our calculation for the first ring (i=0) is correct.\n\n   However, note the problem statement: \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1)) x (h - 4(i-1))\".\n\n   In the problem statement, the first ring is i=1, so they subtract 4*(1-1)=0. The second ring is i=2, subtract 4*(2-1)=4.\n\n   Therefore, we can also index the rings by j from 1 to k, and for the j-th ring, the dimensions are:\n        a_j = w - 4*(j-1)\n        b_j = h - 4*(j-1)\n\n   Then the total number of cells is the sum for j=1 to k of [2*(a_j + b_j) - 4] (if the ring exists).\n\n   But note: the problem says k is the number of rings. The constraint on k ensures that for j=k, a_k = w-4*(k-1) >= 1 and similarly for h, but actually the ring must be drawn only if the rectangle is at least 1x1? The problem says the ring is the border, so we require at least 3x3? Actually, the formula 2*(a+b)-4 requires that a>=1 and b>=1, but if a=1 and b=1 then 2*(1+1)-4=0, which is not correct.\n\n   However, the problem states that the first ring is the edge, and the plate is at least 3x3. And k is bounded by floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n   Example: w=3, h=3, k=1: \n        a1 = 3, b1=3 -> 2*(3+3)-4 = 12-4=8.\n\n   Now, if we try w=5, h=5, k= floor((5+1)/4)=floor(6/4)=1 -> so k=1.\n        a1=5, b1=5 -> 2*(5+5)-4=20-4=16.\n\n   But let's count the border of 5x5: \n        top:5, bottom:5, left:3, right:3 -> 5+5+3+3=16. Correct.\n\n   Now, what if we have a rectangle of 1x1? The problem doesn't say we have to handle that because w,h>=3.\n\n   However, note the constraint: w, h between 3 and 100, and k at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n   So we can safely compute for each ring j from 1 to k.\n\n   But the problem input gives k, and we have to compute the total.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        total_cells = 0\n        for j in range(1, k+1):\n            a = w - 4*(j-1)\n            b = h - 4*(j-1)\n            if a < 3 or b < 3: \n                # Actually, the problem says k is bounded so that the inner rectangle is valid? \n                # But note: the formula for the border requires at least 3x3? Actually, the border is defined for any a>=1 and b>=1, but the formula 2*(a+b)-4 works for a>=1 and b>=1? \n                # However, if a=1 and b=1: 2*(1+1)-4 = 0 -> but that doesn't make sense because the ring would be the entire cell? \n                # But according to the problem, the ring is the border of the inner rectangle. A 1x1 has no border (the border is the set of cells that are adjacent to an empty space, but in a grid of one cell, the border is the entire cell? Actually, the problem says the ring has width 1, so the border of a 1x1 is the entire cell. Then the number of cells should be 1.\n\n                # However, the problem's constraint on k ensures that we don't get to a point where the inner rectangle is too small. Specifically, the maximum k is floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n                # Example: w=5, h=5, k_max = floor((5+1)/4)=1. Then the second ring (k=2) would require a=5-4=1, b=5-4=1 -> which is not allowed by the constraint (k<=1). \n\n                # Therefore, we don't need to handle cases where a or b becomes less than 3 because k is bounded.\n\n                # But wait, the constraint says: k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n                #   min(w,h)=5 -> floor((5+1)/4)=1, so k=2 is not allowed.\n\n                # So we can assume that for j from 1 to k, we have a>=3 and b>=3? Not exactly: \n                #   Let w=100, h=100, k_max = floor((100+1)/4)=25. Then the 25th ring: \n                #       a = 100 - 4*(24) = 100-96=4, which is >=3? \n                #       Actually, the condition for the j-th ring is that the inner rectangle must have at least 3x3? \n                #       The formula for the border requires at least 3x3? Actually, the border is defined for any positive a and b, but the problem's constraint on k is defined so that the inner rectangle is at least 1x1? \n\n                # However, note the problem says: the first ring goes along the edge, and the second 2 cells away. The process stops when the inner rectangle becomes too small to form a ring (but the constraint is given by k).\n\n                # Since the constraint is given, we can simply compute without checking.\n\n            total_cells += 2*(a+b) - 4\n\n   But wait, let me test with the example \"3 3 1\": \n        j=1: a=3, b=3 -> 2*(3+3)-4 = 12-4=8.\n\n   Example \"7 9 1\":\n        j=1: a=7, b=9 -> 2*(7+9)-4=32-4=28.\n\n   Example \"7 9 2\":\n        j=1: 28, j=2: 2*(3+5)-4=16-4=12; total=40.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, note: the problem states that the ring is drawn for the inner rectangle of size (w-4*(j-1)) x (h-4*(j-1)), and the ring is the border of that inner rectangle. \n\n   But wait, there's an alternative way: sometimes people might think the rings are nested and the total gilding is the union of these borders. And indeed, the example does that.\n\n   Therefore, we can write the code as:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        total = 0\n        for j in range(1, k+1):\n            a = w - 4*(j-1)\n            b = h - 4*(j-1)\n            # Since k is bounded by the input constraint, we don't need to check for negative or too small.\n            total += 2*(a+b) - 4\n\n        print(total)\n\n   But wait, let me test with another example: \n        Input: \"5 5 1\" -> output 16 (as above).\n\n   However, note: the problem example does not provide \"5 5 1\", but let me see if the constraint holds: \n        k_max = floor((min(5,5)+1)/4) = floor(6/4)=1 -> so k=1 is allowed.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Another example: \"5 5 2\" is not allowed because k_max=1, so we don't need to handle.\n\n   But wait, the constraint says: \"1 <= k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4)\".\n\n   However, note: the problem says the plate is split into w x h cells, and the rings are drawn as described.\n\n   One more example: \"10 10 2\"\n        k_max = floor((10+1)/4)=floor(11/4)=2 -> so k=2 is allowed.\n\n        j=1: a=10, b=10 -> 2*(10+10)-4=40-4=36.\n        j=2: a=10-4=6, b=10-4=6 -> 2*(6+6)-4=24-4=20.\n        total=36+20=56.\n\n   Let me count the first ring of 10x10: \n        top:10, bottom:10, left:8, right:8 -> 10+10+8+8=36. Correct.\n        second ring: inner rectangle 6x6 -> top:6, bottom:6, left:4, right:4 -> 6+6+4+4=20. Correct.\n\n   So the code is:\n\n        Read w, h, k\n        total = 0\n        for j in range(k):\n            a = w - 4*j\n            b = h - 4*j\n            total += 2*(a+b) - 4\n\n   But wait, the problem indexes the rings by subtracting 4*(j-1) for the j-th ring (with j from 1 to k). In our loop, if we let j run from 0 to k-1, then the first ring (j=0) subtracts 0, the second (j=1) subtracts 4, etc.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        for i in range(k):\n            a = w - 4*i\n            b = h - 4*i\n            total += 2*(a+b) - 4\n\n   This is the same.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the first ring is the edge, which is the entire plate (so no subtraction). Our i=0: subtract 0 -> correct.\n\n   Therefore, we can write the code accordingly.\n\n   But wait, the example \"7 9 2\": \n        i=0: a=7, b=9 -> 2*(7+9)-4 = 28\n        i=1: a=7-4=3, b=9-4=5 -> 2*(3+5)-4=12\n        total=40.\n\n   So the code is:\n\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data:\n            # but the problem says there is one line with three integers, so we assume we get three\n            pass\n        w = int(data[0])\n        h = int(data[1])\n        k = int(data[2])\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            a = w - 4*i\n            b = h - 4*i\n            total += 2*(a + b) - 4\n\n        print(total)\n\n   Let's run the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"3 3 1\" -> 2*(3+3)-4 = 12-4=8 -> prints 8.\n        Example 2: \"7 9 1\" -> 2*(7+9)-4=28 -> prints 28.\n        Example 3: \"7 9 2\" -> 28 + 12 = 40 -> prints 40.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. Our calculation for the second ring subtracts 4 from both dimensions. That is, we remove 2 cells from the left and 2 from the right (or top and bottom) to get the inner rectangle.\n\n   But note: the problem says the ring is drawn on the inner rectangle. The inner rectangle is (w-4*(i)) x (h-4*i) for the i-th ring (0-indexed). \n\n   This is consistent.\n\n   But note: the example picture corresponds to the third example (which is 7x9 with two rings). The example output is 40.\n\n   Therefore, we are confident.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the plate is split into w x h cells. The example \"3 3 1\" is 3x3.\n\n   We'll submit the code.\n\n   But wait, let me test with a square that has more rings: say \"13 13 3\"\n\n        k_max = floor((13+1)/4)=floor(14/4)=3.\n\n        i=0: a=13, b=13 -> 2*(13+13)-4=52-4=48.\n        i=1: a=13-4=9, b=9 -> 2*(9+9)-4=36-4=32.\n        i=2: a=13-8=5, b=5 -> 2*(5+5)-4=20-4=16.\n\n        Total=48+32+16=96.\n\n   Let me count the first ring (13x13): \n        top:13, bottom:13, left:11, right:11 -> 13+13+11+11=48. Correct.\n\n   Second ring: inner rectangle 9x9 -> top:9, bottom:9, left:7, right:7 -> 9+9+7+7=32. Correct.\n\n   Third ring: inner rectangle 5x5 -> top:5, bottom:5, left:3, right:3 -> 5+5+3+3=16. Correct.\n\n   So 96 is correct.\n\n   Code:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            a = w - 4*i\n            b = h - 4*i\n            total += 2*(a+b) - 4\n        print(total)\n\n   However, note: the problem says the plate is a rectangle, and the rings are drawn by moving inward 2 cells for each subsequent ring. The subtraction is 4*i (because we subtract 2 from each side: top and bottom, and left and right). \n\n   But wait, why 4*i? Because each ring removes 2 cells from the top/bottom and 2 from the left/right? Actually, for the i-th ring (0-indexed), we are removing 2*i from the top and 2*i from the bottom? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. That means we remove 2 cells from the top and 2 from the bottom, and similarly 2 from the left and 2 from the right. So the total reduction in width and height is 4*i (for the i-th ring, we remove 2*i from the left/right and 2*i from the top/bottom, so 4*i total).\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is ready.\n\n   However, note: the problem constraints say w, h from 3 to 100, and k from 1 to floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). We are iterating k times, so it's efficient.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples.\n\n   Example: \"3 3 1\" -> 8, \"7 9 1\" -> 28, \"7 9 2\" -> 40.\n\n   We output the integer.\n\n   Final code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. The first ring is placed along the edge of the plate, and each subsequent ring is placed 2 cells away from the previous one, moving inward. Each ring has a width of 1 cell, and the task is to compute the total number of cells covered by all the rings up to the k-th ring.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the number of cells in each concentric ring around a rectangular plate. The first ring is the outermost border of the plate, the second ring is the next border inside the first, and so on. Each ring's dimensions are derived by reducing the original plate dimensions by 4 cells (2 cells from each side) for each subsequent ring.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each ring, the number of cells can be computed using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, adjusted for the fact that the corners are shared. Specifically, the number of cells in a rectangle of size \\(a \\times b\\) is \\(2*(a + b) - 4\\).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate through each of the k rings, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle for that ring, apply the perimeter formula, and sum the results for all rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in \\(O(k)\\) time, where k is the number of rings. Given the constraints (k is at most 25 for the largest plate dimensions), this approach is efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(k):\n        a = w - 4 * i\n        b = h - 4 * i\n        total += 2 * (a + b) - 4\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: the width (w), height (h), and the number of rings (k) to be gilded.\n2. **Initialization**: A variable `total` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the total number of gilded cells.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 0 to k-1:\n   - **Calculate Dimensions**: The dimensions of the inner rectangle for the current ring are computed by subtracting \\(4 \\times i\\) from both the original width and height. This accounts for moving 2 cells inward from each side for each ring.\n   - **Compute Cells**: The number of cells in the current ring is calculated using the formula \\(2*(a + b) - 4\\), which effectively computes the perimeter of the rectangle while adjusting for overlapping corner cells.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, the accumulated total is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the total number of cells by leveraging simple arithmetic operations within a loop, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
