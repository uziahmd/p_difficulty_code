After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then n lines each containing m digits (without spaces)\n We have to count the number of successful students. A student is successful if there exists at least one subject in which he is the best.\n For a subject, being the best means having the highest mark in that subject (and note: there can be multiple students with the same highest mark for that subject).\n\n Approach:\n 1. Read the first line to get n and m.\n 2. Read the next n lines, each containing a string of m digits.\n\n We can break down the problem as follows:\n\n For each subject j (from 0 to m-1), we can find the maximum mark (which is a character, but we can compare as characters since they are '1' to '9').\n Then, for each subject j, we know that every student who has the mark equal to the maximum in that subject is a candidate for being best at that subject.\n\n Now, a student i is successful if there exists at least one subject j such that the mark in subject j for student i is the maximum for subject j.\n\n However, note: it is possible that multiple students share the maximum mark in a subject. Then all of them are considered best for that subject.\n\n So, for each student, we want to check: is there any subject j for which his mark is the maximum in that subject?\n\n Steps:\n\n Option 1:\n   - Precompute for each subject j the maximum mark (as a char).\n   - For each student i, iterate over all subjects j and check if the student's mark in subject j is equal to the maximum for subject j.\n   - If at least one subject j satisfies this, then the student is successful.\n\n But note: what if the maximum mark appears multiple times? Then the condition holds for each occurrence.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        3 3\n        223\n        232\n        112\n\n   Let's break down the gradebook:\n        Student0: \"223\" -> [2,2,3]\n        Student1: \"232\" -> [2,3,2]\n        Student2: \"112\" -> [1,1,2]\n\n   For subject0: max is '2' (from student0 and student1)\n   For subject1: max is '3' (from student1)\n   For subject2: max is '3' (from student0)\n\n   Now, for student0: \n        subject0: 2 == 2 -> True (so student0 is best in subject0) -> successful.\n        Also, subject2: 3 == 3 -> True -> so student0 is successful.\n\n   For student1:\n        subject0: 2 == 2 -> True -> successful.\n        subject1: 3 == 3 -> True -> successful.\n\n   For student2:\n        subject0: 1 != 2 -> False\n        subject1: 1 != 3 -> False\n        subject2: 2 != 3 -> False -> not successful.\n\n   Therefore, output is 2.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Parse input.\n      first_line = input().split()\n      n = int(first_line[0]); m = int(first_line[1])\n\n   Step 2: Read the next n lines and store in a list `students` of strings, each string of length m.\n\n   Step 3: For each subject j (from 0 to m-1), compute the maximum mark (which is a char) from all the students.\n\n        max_marks = []\n        for j in range(m):\n            col = [students[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n            max_mark = max(col)\n            max_marks.append(max_mark)\n\n   Step 4: For each student i, check if there exists at least one subject j such that students[i][j] == max_marks[j].\n\n        successful = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            found = False\n            for j in range(m):\n                if students[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n            if found:\n                successful += 1\n\n   Step 5: Print successful.\n\n However, note: the input example is given as a string in the example input. But the problem says the first line is two integers, then n lines of m digits.\n\n Let's test with the second sample:\n\n        Input: \"3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111\"\n\n        n=3, m=5\n\n        Students:\n            s0: \"91728\"\n            s1: \"11828\"\n            s2: \"11111\"\n\n        Compute max_marks for each column:\n\n            col0: ['9','1','1'] -> max is '9'\n            col1",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m) from the first line of input. Then, read the next n lines, each containing m digits representing the marks of a student in all subjects.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject, find the highest mark achieved by any student. This involves iterating through each column (subject) of the gradebook and identifying the maximum value.\n3. **Check Student Success**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If a student has the highest mark in at least one subject, they are counted as successful.\n4. **Output the Result**: Print the total number of successful students.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    students = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        s = input().strip()\n        students.append(s)\n        \n    max_marks = []\n    for j in range(m):\n        col = [students[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n        max_marks.append(max(col))\n        \n    count_successful = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if students[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                count_successful += 1\n                break\n                \n    print(count_successful)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The first line of input is split into two integers, `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). The subsequent lines are read and stored as strings in a list called `students`.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), the code collects all marks from each student and determines the highest mark using the `max` function. These maximum values are stored in the list `max_marks`.\n3. **Checking Student Success**: For each student, the code checks if their mark in any subject matches the highest mark for that subject. If a match is found, the student is marked as successful, and the loop breaks early to avoid unnecessary checks.\n4. **Output**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects to determine their success status, leveraging simple loops and comparisons for clarity and correctness.",
