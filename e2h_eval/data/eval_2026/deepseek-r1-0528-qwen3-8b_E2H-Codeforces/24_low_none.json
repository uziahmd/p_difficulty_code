She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n We need to leave only the tabs from l to r. Initially, all tabs [1, n] are open.\n\n There are two types of operations:\n  1. Move the cursor: either left (to max(current - 1, a)) or right (to min(current + 1, b)), where a and b are the current minimum and maximum tab indices (which change as we close tabs).\n  2. Close all tabs to the left of the cursor (if any) or to the right (if any).\n\n However, note that when we close some tabs, the boundaries a and b update. But note: we are only concerned with closing tabs outside [l, r]. We can break the problem into two parts: closing the left part (tabs 1 to l-1) and the right part (tabs r+1 to n).\n\n We can consider two main strategies:\n  a) First close the left part, then the right part.\n  b) First close the right part, then the left part.\n\n But note: sometimes we might be able to do both in one go? Actually, we have to leave [l, r]. So we must close everything < l and everything > r.\n\n Steps:\n  - If the current set is already [l, r] (i.e., no tabs to close), then answer 0.\n\n How to close the left part?\n   We need to move the cursor to at least l (but actually, we can close from the left if we are at a position >= l, because the operation \"close left\" will close everything from the current minimum (which is initially 1) up to i-1. But note: after closing some tabs, the minimum index changes.\n\n However, note the operation definition: \n   - Closing left: closes all tabs from [a, i-1] (where a is the current minimum, which initially is 1, but after closing left becomes the next available, which might be l or something else). Similarly for the right.\n\n Actually, the problem is symmetric. We can think of it as having two intervals to close: [1, l-1] and [r+1, n]. We can close them independently, but we can also combine by moving the cursor appropriately.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Case 1: If the entire range [1, n] is already [l, r] (i.e., l==1 and r==n), then 0.\n\n Otherwise, we have to close some tabs. The operations are:\n\n Option 1: Close the left part and then the right part.\n\n   To close the left part (tabs 1 to l-1), we need to move the cursor to a tab that is at least l (so that when we close the left, we don't accidentally close the desired part). Actually, the operation \"close left\" doesn't require being exactly at l, but we must be at a tab that is >= l. However, we can also consider closing the right part first.\n\n Alternatively, note that we can close the left part from any tab that is within [l, r] (because if we are at a tab i >= l, then closing left will close from the current minimum (which is 1) to i-1, but note: if we haven't closed the right part, the current minimum is still 1 until we close the left. Actually, the state of the browser (the set of open tabs) is updated after each operation.\n\n However, we can plan:\n\n  Step 1: We need to get the cursor to a position that allows us to close the left part. Since the left part is from 1 to l-1, we can close the left part from any position in [l, r] (because the left boundary is 1, and we want to close from 1 to i-1, so if i>=l, then we are safe because we don't close below l). But note: we might have to move to the left to close the left part? Actually, we can also close the left part without necessarily being at l? \n\n  Operation for closing left: when the cursor is at i, we close [a, i-1]. Initially, a=1. So if we are at i, then we close from 1 to i-1. We don't want to close [l, i-1] if i-1 >= l? Actually, we want to avoid closing the desired part. So we must ensure that when we close the left, we don't close any tab that is in [l, r]. Therefore, we must have i-1 < l. But wait, if we are at i, then we close from 1 to i-1. So if i-1 < l, then we are not closing any tab in [l, r] (since the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds required for Luba to close all tabs outside the specified segment [l, r] while starting from a given cursor position. The solution involves analyzing the initial and target states of the tabs and determining the most efficient sequence of operations to transition from the initial state to the desired state.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires closing all tabs outside the segment [l, r]. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right (within bounds) or closing all tabs to the left or right of the cursor. The key observation is that the optimal strategy depends on whether the initial cursor position already lies within the segment [l, r] or not.\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - If the entire range of tabs is already within [l, r] (i.e., l == 1 and r == n), no operations are needed.\n   - If the cursor is already within [l, r], the solution involves two possible scenarios: either close all tabs to the left first then the right, or vice versa. The minimal time is determined by the shorter path to one of the boundaries (either l-1 or r+1).\n   - If the cursor is outside [l, r], additional steps are needed to move the cursor into the segment before closing the respective tabs.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves checking the initial conditions and then calculating the minimal steps required based on the relative positions of the cursor and the segment [l, r]. The operations are broken down into moving the cursor and closing tabs, with each operation counted as one second.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    pos = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    r = int(data[3])\n    \n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    if l <= pos <= r:\n        # Cursor is within the segment [l, r]\n        left_ops = 0\n        if pos > l:\n            left_ops = pos - l\n        else:\n            left_ops = 0\n            \n        right_ops = 0\n        if pos < r:\n            right_ops = r - pos\n        else:\n            right_ops = 0\n            \n        total_seconds = 1 + min(left_ops + 1, right_ops + 1) + max(left_ops, right_ops)\n        print(total_seconds)\n    else:\n        # Cursor is not in the segment [l, r]\n        if pos < l:\n            moves_to_segment = l - pos\n            total_seconds = moves_to_segment + 1  # Close left part after moving to l\n            print(total_seconds)\n        else:\n            moves_to_segment = pos - l + 1\n            total_seconds = moves_to_segment + 1  # Close right part after moving to r\n            print(total_seconds)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: If the segment [l, r] covers all tabs (l == 1 and r == n), output 0 as no operations are needed.\n2. **Cursor within Segment**: If the cursor is already within [l, r], calculate the steps to move the cursor to the nearest boundary (l or r) and then close the remaining tabs. The minimal steps are computed by considering both directions (left and right) and choosing the shortest path.\n3. **Cursor outside Segment**: If the cursor is outside [l, r], first move it into the segment, then close the tabs outside. The steps to move the cursor into the segment are straightforward, followed by a single operation to close the opposite side of the segment.\n4. **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently checks the initial conditions and computes the minimal operations by leveraging simple arithmetic and conditional checks, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
