Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem.\n\n We are given an initial string s of digits and a series of queries. Each query is of the form \"di->ti\", meaning replace every occurrence of digit di with the string ti (which can be empty).\n\n However, note: the queries are applied in order. But doing naive replacement (like repeatedly scanning the string for each query) would be too slow because the string can be long (up to 10^5) and there can be up to 10^5 queries.\n\n Also, note that we are to compute the number modulo 1000000007 (10^9+7). The challenge is that after replacements, the string can become very long (but note: the total length of all ti's is <= 10^5, so the overall expansion is bounded by the total expansion factor? Actually, the problem says the sum of lengths of ti for all queries is <= 10^5, but note: one query might refer to a digit that was already replaced by a longer string? \n\n However, observe: the queries are applied in order, and each query replaces a specific digit (from '0' to '9') with a fixed string. So if we do:\n\n   Initially: s = \"123\"\n   Query1: \"2->00\" -> becomes \"1003\"\n   Then we have a subsequent query, say \"3->4\", then we replace the '3' in \"1003\" with \"4\", so we get \"1004\".\n\n But note: the problem does not say that the replacements are independent. Actually, the queries are sequential and each query operates on the current string.\n\n However, the catch is that the same digit might appear multiple times and we have to replace all occurrences in the current string.\n\n But if we try to simulate the entire string for each query, worst-case the string could become huge. For example, if we start with a string of 10^5 digits and each query replaces one digit with a string of 10^5 digits, then we cannot store the entire string.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We cannot store the entire string if it grows too much. But note: the problem states that the total length of ti for all queries is at most 10^5. However, note that one query might refer to a digit that was already expanded. For example:\n\n   Query1: \"1->22\"\n   Query2: \"2->11\"\n\n Then initially we have \"1\", then after Query1: \"22\", then after Query2: \"1111\". Then if we have more queries, they will apply to the entire expanded string.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"the sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 10^5\". This is the raw input. However, when we expand, the length of the string can grow arbitrarily? Actually, no: the problem constraints say the total length of all ti's is 10^5, but note that the expansion is done sequentially and the same digit might be expanded multiple times.\n\n Example: \n   Start with \"0\"\n   Query1: \"0->00\" -> then we have \"00\"\n   Query2: \"0->00\" again -> then we have \"0000\"\n\n But the total length of ti's in this example is 2 (for the first query) and 2 (for the second), so total 4 which is <= 10^5. However, the resulting string can be very long (exponentially growing). So we cannot store the entire string.\n\n We need to process without building the entire string.\n\n Idea: dynamic programming or processing from right to left, keeping track of the value of the current number and the length (for modular arithmetic) but also handling the fact that we are replacing digits.\n\n However, note: we are to compute the number modulo 1000000007. The number is built by concatenating the digit strings.\n\n Steps:\n\n Let's consider processing the entire transformation and then computing the number modulo 1000000007.\n\n But we cannot build the entire string. We must use the fact that the total expansion is bounded by the input constraints, but actually the expansion can be exponential.\n\n Alternative idea: work backwards.\n\n Observation: The queries are given in the order of application. However, if we reverse the order, we can precompute what each digit eventually becomes.\n\n But note: the queries are sequential. The last query is applied to the string that has been transformed by all previous ones.\n\n Example: \n   s0 = \"12\"\n   Query1: \"1->abc\", then string becomes \"abc2\"\n   Query2: \"2->def\", then string becomes \"abcdef\"\n\n Now, if we reverse the queries:\n   Start from the final state and go backward? That is, we want to know for each digit, what it becomes after all queries.\n\n However, note: the queries are applied in order, so the replacements for a digit might depend on the transformations that have been applied to the digits that appear in the replacement string.\n\n Actually, the problem is similar to a system of string rewriting. We can use memoization or dynamic programming for each digit.\n\n Let f_i(d) be the final string that the digit d becomes after processing all the queries.\n\n But note: the queries are applied in sequence. Each query is of the form (d, t). When we process a query, we replace every occurrence of d by t. Then later queries might contain d again? Actually, no: the queries are given as separate rules. But wait, the replacement string t might contain digits that were defined in earlier queries? \n\n Example: \n   Query1: \"1->22\"\n   Query2: \"2->11\"\n\n Then if we start with \"1\", after Query1 we have \"22\", then after Query2 we have \"1111\".\n\n But if we try to define the final transformation for each digit independently, we see that the transformation for '1' is not just \"22\", because then the '2' in \"22\" is replaced by \"11\", so the entire transformation for '1' is \"1111\".\n\n How to compute the final transformation for each digit?\n\n We can process the queries in reverse order and update the transformation for each digit.\n\n However, note: the queries are applied in the given order. So the last query is the last transformation applied. Therefore, if we process the queries from last to first, we can update the transformation for the digit being replaced.\n\n Steps for reverse processing:\n\n   Let F(d) be the string that the digit d is finally replaced by.\n\n   Initially, F(d) = d for all digits.\n\n   Then, process the queries from last to first. For a query (d, t):\n        Before this query, the digit d was already transformed by subsequent queries. But wait: in the forward direction, the query (d, t) replaces d by t, and then any digit in t is subject to the following queries.\n\n        In the reverse, we want to update F(d) as follows:\n\n        First, note that in the forward direction, the query (d, t) replaces every occurrence of d by the string t. Then, the following queries (if any) will transform the digits in t.\n\n        Therefore, the final effect of the query (d, t) is that d is replaced by the string T, where T is t with each digit c replaced by F_after_this_query(c). But F_after_this_query is the state after processing all the queries that come after the current one.\n\n        Since we are processing backwards, we have already computed the transformations for all digits for the subsequent queries. So we can compute:\n\n            F_before_this_query(d) = T, where T is obtained by taking the string t and replacing each character c in t by F_after_this_query(c)\n\n        And then, for the current query, we set F_after_this_query(d) = T.\n\n        However, note: the current query is about to be removed (since we are going backwards), so we update the transformation for d to be the result of the current query (i.e., the expanded version of t using the subsequent queries) and then the next query (in reverse) might use this updated transformation.\n\n        But wait, in the reverse processing, we start from the last query and go backwards. The last query is the last transformation, so the state after the last query is the current F. Then we remove the last query and update the transformation for the digit d: now we know that before the last query, the digit d was transformed differently.\n\n        Actually, we can think:\n\n          Forward: \n            Step 1: apply query n (last query) then n-1, ... until step 1.\n\n          Reverse:\n            Let F_i(d) be the transformation of digit d after the i-th query (i from 1 to n). We want F_n(d).\n\n          Alternatively, we can define:\n\n            Let G(d) be the transformation of digit d after all queries.\n\n          How to compute G(d)? \n\n          We process the queries in reverse order (from n to 1):\n\n            For query i: (d_i, t_i)\n            Then, for each digit d, the transformation G(d) is:\n\n              If d == d_i, then G(d) = the transformation of the string t_i (using G, but note: we haven't updated the other digits yet? Actually, we are updating from last to first, so we use the current G (which is the transformation after all queries) to expand t_i.\n\n            Then, we set G(d_i) = the expansion of t_i (with each digit c in t_i replaced by G(c)).\n\n          However, note: the query i is applied before the subsequent queries. In the forward direction, the query i replaces d_i by t_i, and then the subsequent queries (which we have already processed in reverse) are applied to the entire string. Therefore, the expansion of t_i should use the transformation that is the result of applying all queries from i+1 to n. \n\n          So, we can do:\n\n            Let F be a function (or array) that maps each digit to a string (its final transformation). Initially, F(d) = d for all d.\n\n            Then, process queries from last to first (from n-1 down to 0):\n\n                For query (d, t): \n                    Let s_new = \"\"\n                    For each char c in t:\n                        s_new += F(c)\n\n                    Then, set F(d) = s_new\n\n            Then, the entire string s_initial is transformed by replacing each digit d by F(d) (after processing all queries).\n\n        Why is that correct?\n\n          Consider: the last query is the one that appears last. After the last query, the transformation for each digit is stored in F. Then, when we process the previous query, we update the transformation for the digit d that was in that query: we take the string t from that query and expand it using the current F (which includes the effect of all subsequent queries). Then set F(d) to that expanded string.\n\n          Example: \n            s_initial = \"12\"\n            Queries: \n                Query1: \"1->22\"\n                Query2: \"2->11\"\n\n            Process queries in reverse order (first Query2, then Query1).\n\n            Step 0: F(d) = d for all d.\n\n            Step 1: Process Query2 (last query): (d='2', t=\"11\")\n                Expand \"11\": for each '1' in \"11\", replace by F('1') which is currently '1'. So s_new = \"11\".\n                Then set F('2') = \"11\"\n\n            Step 2: Process Query1: (d='1', t=\"22\")\n                Expand \"22\": for each '2' in \"22\", replace by F('2') which is \"11\", so s_new = \"1111\"\n                Then set F('1') = \"1111\"\n\n            Then, transform the initial string \"12\": \n                '1' -> \"1111\", '2' -> \"11\", so the entire string is \"111111\".\n\n            Now, the expected result is: \n                Forward: \n                  Start: \"12\"\n                  Apply Query1: replace '1' by \"22\" -> \"222\" (wait, no: the initial string is \"12\", so replace '1' by \"22\" -> \"222\"? Actually, wait: the initial string is \"12\", so the '1' becomes \"22\", so we have \"222\" -> but then wait, the second query is applied to the entire string? \n\n            Actually, the queries are applied sequentially to the entire string.\n\n            Step-by-step forward:\n\n                Initial: \"12\"\n                Query1: Replace every '1' by \"22\": becomes \"222\" (because we have one '1' and one '2'; the '1' is replaced, so we remove the '1' and put \"22\", so \"22\" + \"2\" -> \"222\")\n                Then Query2: Replace every '2' by \"11\": becomes \"111111\" (each '2' in \"222\" is replaced by \"11\", so \"111111\")\n\n            But wait, our reverse method produced \"111111\", which matches.\n\n            However, note: in the forward step, after Query1, the string is \"222\", and then Query2 replaces each '2' by \"11\", so \"222\" becomes \"111111\". So the reverse method is correct.\n\n        But note: the replacement in the forward direction is global. In the reverse method, we are effectively composing the transformations.\n\n        However, there is a caveat: the expansion for a digit d_i in query i uses the transformation that we have computed for the subsequent queries (all the queries that occur after i). This is because the subsequent queries have already been applied (in the forward direction) and so the expansion of any digit in the replacement string must account for those.\n\n        Therefore, we can use:\n\n            Let F be an array (or list) of 10 elements (for digits '0' to '9') representing the final string for that digit.\n\n            We start by setting F[d] = d (as a string) for each digit d (from '0' to '9').\n\n            Then, for each query from last to first (i.e., from the bottom of the input to the top):\n\n                Let the query be (d, t) (where d is a single digit and t is a string)\n\n                We compute the expanded string for t: \n                    expanded_t = ''.join(F[int(c)] for c in t)   # But wait, we have to map the character to the corresponding F.\n\n                Then set F[int(d)] = expanded_t\n\n            Then, we process the initial string s: \n                result_string = ''.join(F[int(c)] for c in s)\n\n            Then, we compute the number from result_string modulo 1000000007.\n\n        But wait: the problem does not require the actual string, but the number modulo 1000000007. And the string can be extremely long (exponentially long). We cannot build the entire string.\n\n        We must compute the number without building the entire string.\n\n        How to compute the number from a string of digits modulo 1000000007?\n\n        We can use dynamic programming that processes the string from left to right and accumulates the value. But the string is too long.\n\n        However, note: we have the transformation for each digit. We are replacing each digit by a string (which we don't store explicitly, but we have the transformation function F). But the transformation for each digit is a string, but we cannot store the entire string because the total length might be huge.\n\n        But wait: the problem states that the total length of all ti in the queries is <= 10^5. However, the expansion of a single digit might lead to a very long string. But note: the reverse processing only stores the expanded string for each digit. And there are only 10 digits. However, the length of F(d) for a digit d might be very large (exponentially large). \n\n        Example: \n            Query1: \"0->00\"\n            Query2: \"0->000\"\n            ... \n            After k queries, the expansion for '0' could be 2^k zeros.\n\n        And k can be up to 10^5? Then the string would be of length 2^(10^5) which is astronomical.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot store the entire expanded string for each digit.\n\n        We must find a way to compute the number without building the entire string.\n\n        Let's change our perspective: instead of storing the expanded string for each digit, we can store the value (mod 1000000007) and the length (in terms of power of 10) for the expanded string of each digit.\n\n        We need to know, for a given digit d, the number represented by F(d) and the length of F(d) (so that we can combine the numbers).\n\n        But note: the entire number is built by concatenation. The value of a string s is:\n\n            value(s) = (value of the first part) * (10^(len(second part))) + value(second part)\n\n        So we can represent each digit's expansion by:\n\n            (value, length)\n\n        where:\n            value: the number formed by the string (mod 1000000007)\n            length: the number of digits (which is the total length of the string)\n\n        Then, to combine two parts: \n            Let A = (a1, l1) and B = (a2, l2)\n            Then the combined value is: a1 * (10^l2) + a2   (mod 1000000007)\n\n        And the total length is l1 + l2.\n\n        Now, the transformation for a digit d:\n\n            Initially: F(d) = d (the digit itself)\n                value(d) = int(d) (mod 1000000007)\n                length(d) = 1\n\n            Then, for a query (d, t): \n                We are replacing d by t. But t is a string of digits. We can compute the value and length for t by combining the expansions of its digits.\n\n            However, note: the expansion of t is the concatenation of the expansions of its digits.\n\n            Let G(t) = (v, L) for a string t, defined recursively:\n\n                If t is empty: (0, 0)\n\n                Otherwise, for the first digit c and the rest t':\n\n                    (v1, L1) = F(c)   [the expansion of c]\n                    (v2, L2) = G(t')\n\n                    Then, G(t) = (v1 * (10^L2) + v2, L1 + L2)   (mod 1000000007)\n\n            Then, for the query (d, t): \n                Let (v_t, L_t) = G(t)\n\n                Then, we set for d: \n                    value(d) = v_t, length(d) = L_t\n\n            Then, we process the initial string s by:\n\n                (result_value, result_length) = (0, 0)\n                for each digit c in s:\n                    (v, L) = F(c)\n                    result_value = (result_value * (10^L) + v) % mod\n                    result_length += L\n\n            But wait: the initial string s is transformed by replacing each digit by its expansion. However, the expansion for a digit is stored as (value, length). Then we can compute the entire result without building the string.\n\n        However, note: the queries are applied in order, and we are processing them in reverse. But we need to update the transformations for the digits.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Precompute for each digit d (from '0' to '9') the tuple (val[d], len[d]) initially:\n                val[d] = int(d) % mod\n                len[d] = 1\n\n            Then, we'll have an array (or list) for the current value and length for each digit.\n\n            Then, we process the queries in reverse order (from last to first). For a query (d, t):\n\n                First, we need to compute the expansion for the string t (which is the concatenation of the expansions of each digit in t). But note: the expansion for each digit in t is the current state (which includes all subsequent queries). \n\n                How to compute the expansion for t?\n\n                    We can traverse the string t and for each digit c in t, use the current (val[c], len[c]) to build the value and length for t.\n\n                Let (v_t, L_t) = (0, 0)\n                For each char c in t:\n                    Let (v, L) = (val[c], len[c])\n                    Then, new_value = (v_t * pow(10, L, mod) + v) % mod\n                    Then, new_length = L_t + L\n\n                Then, set for digit d:\n                    val[d] = v_t\n                    len[d] = L_t\n\n            Then, after processing all queries, we process the initial string s similarly.\n\n        But note: the exponentiation (pow(10, L, mod)) must be done modulo 1000000007. However, L can be very large (because the length is the total length of the expansion, which is exponential). But wait, we are storing the length as an integer, and the length can be astronomically huge (exponential). However, note that we are only storing the value modulo 1000000007 and the length modulo something? \n\n        Actually, the length is needed to compute the power of 10 for the shifting. But the length itself is used as an exponent. However, we cannot store the entire length because it can be huge (exponential). \n\n        But note: we are only interested in the value mod 1000000007. The shifting operation is:\n\n            new_value = (v_t * (10^L) + v) % mod\n\n        We can compute 10^L mod mod, but L is the length (number of digits) of the expansion. However, L can be huge (like 10^100000) and we cannot compute 10^L mod mod by exponentiation if L is that big.\n\n        Alternative: we can store the value and the length (as an integer) but the length is the total number of digits. However, the length might be too big to store as an integer (it can be exponential). \n\n        But note: the problem says the total length of ti for all queries is <= 10^5, but the expansion of a digit might lead to a very long string. However, the modulus is 1000000007, and we are only interested in the value mod 1000000007. \n\n        However, the length is used to shift the current value. The shifting is:\n\n            current_value = (current_value * (10 ** length_of_next_part)) % mod\n\n        But if the length_of_next_part is huge, then 10 ** length_of_next_part is a number with many digits and we cannot compute it directly.\n\n        We can use modular exponentiation for the base 10, but the modulus is 1000000007. However, note:\n\n            We need to compute 10^(L) mod 1000000007, where L is the length (number of digits) of the next part.\n\n        But wait: the shifting is done for the entire next part. The next part has L digits, so we are shifting the current value by L digits. \n\n        However, the modulus is 1000000007, and we are working modulo 1000000007. The shifting by L digits is equivalent to multiplying by (10^L mod 1000000007). \n\n        But note: the length L is the total number of digits. The value 10^L mod 1000000007 can be computed if we know L, even if L is huge? \n\n        Actually, Euler's theorem: since 10 and 1000000007 are coprime, we can reduce the exponent modulo φ(1000000007). However, φ(1000000007) = 1000000006 because 1000000007 is prime.\n\n        So, to compute 10^L mod 1000000007, we can compute L mod 1000000006, and then compute 10^(L mod 1000000006) mod 1000000007, provided that L >= 0.\n\n        BUT: is that valid? Yes, because 10 and 1000000007 are coprime. However, note that L is the length (a positive integer) and can be huge. But storing L as an integer is not possible because L can be exponential (like 2^100000) and we cannot store that as an integer.\n\n        Therefore, we must avoid storing the actual length (the total number of digits) as an integer. Instead, we can store the length modulo 1000000006 (the totient) for the purpose of modular exponentiation? \n\n        However, wait: the shifting requires the exponent L, and we are going to use it in two ways:\n\n          1. To compute 10^L mod 1000000007 (for shifting)\n          2. To update the length for the next part (which is the sum of the lengths of the digits in the expansion).\n\n        But the length itself (the total number of digits) is used to compute the shifting. However, the shifting uses the length as an exponent. We can store:\n\n            For each digit d: \n                value[d] = the value of the expansion of d (mod 1000000007)\n                len_exp[d] = the length of the expansion of d (as an integer)   --> but this integer is too big to store.\n\n        Alternatively, we can store:\n\n            value[d] = the value (mod 1000000007)\n            len_phi[d] = the length of the expansion of d modulo 1000000006   (for the purpose of exponentiation)\n\n        Then, when combining two parts:\n\n            value_combined = (value1 * (10^(len_phi2) mod 1000000007) + value2) % mod\n            len_phi_combined = (len_phi1 + len_phi2) % 1000000006   (but wait: is the length additive modulo 1000000006? Yes, because the length is the sum of the lengths of the parts.)\n\n        However, note: the length is the total number of digits, and the shifting is by the entire length (which is a non-negative integer). The exponentiation base 10 is periodic with period 1000000006 (by Euler). But the length is additive, so we can store the length modulo 1000000006.\n\n        But caution: the shifting is by a number L, and we compute 10^L mod 1000000007. Since L might be huge, we can reduce L modulo 1000000006 (the totient) and then use modular exponentiation.\n\n        However, note: the length is the total number of digits, and we are storing it modulo 1000000006. Then, when we combine two parts, the length is the sum of the lengths of the two parts. But the actual length is the sum, and we only care about the exponent for 10^L mod 1000000007, which is periodic. \n\n        But is that safe? \n\n        Example: \n            Part1: length L1, Part2: length L2.\n            Combined length L = L1 + L2.\n\n            Then, 10^(L1+L2) mod 1000000007 = (10^(L1) * 10^(L2)) mod 1000000007.\n\n            And we can compute:\n                10^(L1) mod 1000000007 = 10^(L1 mod 1000000006) mod 1000000007, provided that L1 >= 0.\n\n            Similarly for L2.\n\n            Then, 10^(L1+L2) mod 1000000007 = (10^(L1 mod 1000000006) * 10^(L2 mod 1000000006)) mod 1000000007.\n\n            But note: we are storing L1_mod = L1 % 1000000006 and L2_mod = L2 % 1000000006, then:\n\n                exponent1 = L1_mod\n                exponent2 = L2_mod\n                exponent_combined = (L1_mod + L2_mod) % 1000000006   ??? \n\n            Actually, no: the exponents add in the exponentiation, but the exponent for the product is the sum of the exponents. However, Euler's theorem says:\n\n                10^a * 10^b = 10^(a+b) mod 1000000007.\n\n            So we can compute:\n\n                base1 = pow(10, exponent1, mod)\n                base2 = pow(10, exponent2, mod)\n                base_combined = (base1 * base2) % mod\n\n            But note: the combined exponent for the entire shift is (L1+L2). And we have:\n\n                base_combined = 10^(L1+L2) mod 1000000007 = (10^(L1) * 10^(L2)) mod 1000000007.\n\n            However, we can also compute:\n\n                base_combined = pow(10, (L1+L2) % 1000000006, mod)\n\n            But wait: Euler's theorem requires that the exponent is reduced modulo φ(mod) and then we can use:\n\n                10^(L1+L2) mod 1000000007 = 10^((L1+L2) % 1000000006) mod 1000000007   ??? \n\n            This is true only if (L1+L2) is sufficiently large? Actually, Euler's theorem says:\n\n                a^φ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n) for a and n coprime.\n\n            Then, a^k ≡ a^(k mod φ(n)) (mod n) only holds if k >= φ(n) ? Not exactly, but we can write:\n\n                k = q * φ(n) + r, with 0 <= r < φ(n)\n\n                then a^k = (a^φ(n))^q * a^r ≡ 1^q * a^r ≡ a^r (mod n)\n\n            So yes, we can reduce the exponent modulo φ(n) (if a and n are coprime). But note: 10 and 1000000007 are coprime.\n\n            Therefore, we can reduce the exponent (L1+L2) modulo 1000000006 (the totient) and then compute 10^(reduced_exponent) mod 1000000007.\n\n            However, we must note: if the exponent is 0, then 10^0=1. And the reduction works.\n\n        So the plan is:\n\n            Let mod = 1000000007\n            Let phi = 1000000006\n\n            We maintain for each digit d (from 0 to 9):\n\n                val[d]: the value of the expansion (mod mod)\n                len_phi[d]: the total length of the expansion (mod phi)   [we store the length modulo phi]\n\n            Then, for a query (d, t):\n\n                We need to compute the expansion of t (which is the concatenation of the expansions of each digit in t).\n\n                We traverse t:\n\n                    Let (v_t, l_t) = (0, 0)   (value and length modulo phi for the expansion of t)\n\n                    For each char c in t:\n\n                        current_val = val[c]\n                        current_len = len_phi[c]   (this is stored modulo phi)\n\n                        Then, update:\n\n                            v_t = (v_t * pow(10, current_len, mod) + current_val) % mod\n\n                            l_t = (l_t + current_len) % phi\n\n                Then, set val[d] = v_t, len_phi[d] = l_t\n\n            Then, after processing all queries, we process the initial string s:\n\n                result_val = 0\n                result_len = 0   (we don't need the total length for the answer, but we need to shift by the length of each part)\n\n                Actually, we only need the value. However, the shifting requires the length of the next part (to know how many zeros to shift). But wait, we are processing the string from left to right, and the next part is the rest of the string? \n\n                Actually, we process each digit in the initial string s:\n\n                    For each char c in s:\n\n                        current_val = val[c]\n                        current_len = len_phi[c]\n\n                        Then, result_val = (result_val * pow(10, current_len, mod) + current_val) % mod\n\n                Then, output result_val.\n\n        But wait: the above update for the initial string is correct because we are effectively concatenating the expansion of each digit.\n\n        However, note: the expansion of a digit is stored as (val, len_phi). And when we update the result_val, we multiply the current result_val by 10^(length of the next part) and then add the value of the next part.\n\n        This is the standard way to combine two numbers when concatenating their decimal representations.\n\n        But note: the length of the next part is the entire expansion of that digit (which is stored in len_phi[c]), and we are storing it modulo phi (1000000006) for the exponentiation.\n\n        However, the exponentiation uses the length modulo 1000000006, which is safe because of Euler's theorem.\n\n        But what if the length is 0? Then pow(10,0,mod)=1, which is correct.\n\n        Also, note: the length of the expansion of a digit d is stored as an integer modulo 1000000006. The initial length is 1, and 1 mod 1000000006 is 1.\n\n        Example: \n            s_initial = \"0\", and we have a query \"0->00\"\n\n            Then, for the query (d='0', t=\"00\"):\n\n                Compute expansion for \"00\":\n\n                    First digit '0': \n                        current_val = 0, current_len = 1\n                        v_t = 0, l_t = 1\n\n                    Second digit '0':\n                        v_t = (0 * (10^1) + 0) % mod = 0\n                        l_t = (1 + 1) % 1000000006 = 2\n\n                Then, set val['0'] = 0, len_phi['0'] = 2.\n\n            Then, processing the initial string \"0\":\n\n                result_val = 0\n                Then, for the digit '0': \n                    result_val = (0 * (10^2) + 0) % mod = 0.\n\n            Expected: the expansion of \"0\" is \"00\", which is the number 0, so 0 is correct.\n\n            But wait: the number 00 is 0, so that's correct.\n\n        Another example: \n            Query: \"0->1\", then the expansion of \"0\" is \"1\", so the number is 1.\n\n        Now, consider a more complex example:\n\n            s_initial = \"1\"\n            Query: \"1->12\"\n\n            Then, we process the query (d='1', t=\"12\"):\n\n                For t=\"12\": \n                    First digit '1': (val['1']=1, len_phi['1']=1)\n                        v_t = 0 * (10^1) + 1 = 1\n                        l_t = 0 +",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a series of string replacement queries on an initial digit string and compute the resulting number modulo 1000000007. The challenge lies in efficiently handling the replacements without explicitly constructing the potentially enormous intermediate strings, which could be computationally infeasible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves processing multiple queries where each query replaces all occurrences of a specific digit in the current string with another string. The key observation is that each query's effect can be composed in reverse order, allowing us to precompute the final transformation for each digit without processing the entire string repeatedly.\n2. **Insight**: By processing queries in reverse order, we can determine the final form of each digit after all transformations. For each digit, we maintain two pieces of information:\n   - **Value**: The numerical value of the transformed digit string modulo 1000000007.\n   - **Length**: The total number of digits in the transformed string, modulo 1000000006 (the totient of 1000000007, used for efficient modular exponentiation).\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - **Initialization**: Start with each digit mapping to itself (value is the digit itself, length is 1).\n   - **Reverse Query Processing**: For each query from last to first, compute the value and length of the replacement string by combining the current transformations of its digits. Update the target digit's value and length with these computed values.\n   - **Result Computation**: After processing all queries, compute the final number by processing each digit in the initial string using its precomputed value and length, combining them step-by-step using modular arithmetic to avoid overflow.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nmod = 1000000007\nphi = 1000000006\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    s_initial = data[0].strip()\n    n = int(data[1])\n    \n    queries = []\n    for i in range(2, 2 + n):\n        parts = data[i].split('->')\n        if len(parts) < 2:\n            continue\n        d = parts[0].strip()\n        t = parts[1].strip()\n        queries.append((d, t))\n    \n    val = [i % mod for i in range(10)]\n    len_phi = [1] * 10\n    \n    for i in range(len(queries) - 1, -1, -1):\n        d_str, t_str = queries[i]\n        d_digit = int(d_str)\n        current_val = 0\n        current_len = 0\n        \n        for char in t_str:\n            c_digit = int(char)\n            power_val = pow(10, len_phi[c_digit], mod)\n            current_val = (current_val * power_val + val[c_digit]) % mod\n            current_len = (current_len + len_phi[c_digit]) % phi\n        \n        val[d_digit] = current_val\n        len_phi[d_digit] = current_len\n    \n    result_val = 0\n    for char in s_initial:\n        c_digit = int(char)\n        power_val = pow(10, len_phi[c_digit], mod)\n        result_val = (result_val * power_val + val[c_digit]) % mod\n    \n    print(result_val)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The initial digit string and the number of queries are read from input. Each query is parsed into a digit and its replacement string.\n2. **Reverse Query Processing**: Starting from the last query to the first, the algorithm computes the value and length of the replacement string by leveraging the current transformations of its constituent digits. This ensures that each query's effect is composed with all subsequent queries already processed.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: The value of each transformed digit is computed modulo 1000000007, and the length is tracked modulo 1000000006 to facilitate efficient computation of large exponents (using Euler's theorem).\n4. **Result Computation**: The initial string is processed digit by digit, combining each digit's transformed value and length using modular arithmetic to build the final result without explicitly constructing the potentially massive intermediate string.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem constraints by leveraging modular arithmetic and reverse processing of queries, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
