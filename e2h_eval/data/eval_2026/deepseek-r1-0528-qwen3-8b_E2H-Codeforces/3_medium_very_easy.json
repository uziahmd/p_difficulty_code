Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering the gaps between lanterns.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line for n and l.\n 2. Read the next line which contains n integers (lantern positions).\n 3. Sort the list of lantern positions.\n 4. The entire street must be covered from 0 to l.\n\n Note: The lanterns at a position x light the interval [x-d, x+d]. But note that we have multiple lanterns.\n\n We can break the problem into two parts:\n   a) The leftmost part: from 0 to the first lantern.\n   b) The gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n   c) The rightmost part: from the last lantern to l.\n\n However, note that if we have a lantern at 0, then the left gap is already covered (d doesn't need to cover from 0 to 0). Similarly for l.\n\n Actually, we can think:\n\n  - The first lantern must cover from 0 to at least the first lantern's position + d. But we can also consider that the light must reach 0 from the first lantern? Actually, the condition is that the entire street [0, l] is lit.\n\n How to compute the necessary d?\n\n  Let the sorted positions be a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1].\n\n  Condition 1: The first lantern must cover from 0 to a[0]. Therefore, we require that the left end (0) is within d of a[0]: so d >= a[0] (because from a[0] we go left by d, so the leftmost point we can cover is a[0]-d, and we need a[0]-d <= 0 -> d>=a[0]).\n\n  Condition 2: For each gap between two consecutive lanterns (from a[i] to a[i+1]), the two lanterns must cover the entire segment. The requirement is that the light from the left lantern (at a[i]) extends to at least a[i+1]-d_from_left, and the light from the right lantern (at a[i+1]) starts at most a[i+1]-d_from_right. However, note that the whole gap [a[i], a[i+1]] must be covered. The maximum gap that can be covered by two lanterns with radius d is 2*d. But the gap between a[i] and a[i+1] is (a[i+1]-a[i]). However, note that the lanterns at a[i] and a[i+1] together can cover from a[i]-d to a[i+1]+d. The gap in the middle is (a[i+1]-a[i]). The condition for covering the gap is that the two lights must meet or overlap. Specifically, the light from the left lantern must extend to at least a[i+1] - d, and the light from the right lantern must extend to at most a[i+1] - d (but actually, the condition is that the union of the two intervals [a[i]-d, a[i]+d] and [a[i+1]-d, a[i+1]+d] must cover [a[i], a[i+1]]. However, we can also think: the entire gap must be covered, so the distance from a[i] to a[i+1] must be covered by the two lights. The minimal d for the gap is (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n  Condition 3: Similarly, the last lantern must cover from a[n-1] to l: so d >= l - a[n-1].\n\n  However, note: the problem requires the minimum d such that the whole street is lit.\n\n  So, we can set d to be the maximum of:\n      candidate1 = a[0] / 2   [But wait: actually, to cover from 0 to a[0], we need d >= a[0] (if we use one lantern at a[0], then the leftmost point it covers is a[0]-d, and we need a[0]-d <= 0 -> d>=a[0]). But if we have multiple lanterns, maybe we don't need to set d as large as a[0]? Actually, we must cover 0. The first lantern at a[0] must cover 0, so d must be at least a[0] (unless there's another lantern closer to 0? but the array is sorted, so the first lantern is the leftmost). However, note: we might have multiple lanterns, but the leftmost lantern is the one at a[0]. So the condition for the left end is that the leftmost lantern must have its left coverage (a[0]-d) <= 0, so d >= a[0].\n\n  But wait: what if we have two lanterns? Consider sample 2: \"2 5\\n2 5\". \n      n=2, l=5, lanterns at 2 and 5.\n      Condition for left: d >= 2 (to cover 0 from the first lantern). But then the second lantern at 5 must cover up to 5, so we need d>=0 (since 5-d <=5 and the street ends at 5). However, the gap between 2 and 5 is 3, and the two lanterns must cover the gap. The first lantern covers [2-d, 2+d] and the second [5-d,5+d]. To cover the gap, we require 2+d >= 5-d -> 2*d >= 3 -> d>=1.5. \n\n  But the sample output is 2.0. Why? Because the entire street must be lit. The street is from 0 to 5.\n\n  With d=2.0:\n      First lantern: [0,4] (because 2-2=0, 2+2=4)\n      Second lantern: [3,7] (but the street ends at 5, so we care only [3,5])\n      Together they cover [0,4] and [3,5] -> [0,5] is covered.\n\n  However, note that the condition for the left end is d>=2 (from the first lantern) and for the gap we require d>= (5-2)/2 = 1.5, and for the right end we require d>= (5-5)=0. Then the maximum of these is max(2, 1.5, 0)=2.\n\n  But wait, the left end condition: we require the first lantern to cover 0, so d must be at least 2. That is correct.\n\n  However, let me reexamine: \n      The condition for the left end is that the leftmost point (0) must be within d of the first lantern. So d must be at least a[0] (which is 2). Similarly, the condition for the right end is that the last lantern must cover l, so d must be at least (l - a[-1]) (which is 5-5=0). And for the gap, the condition is that the two lanterns must meet: the first lantern's right end (a[0]+d) must be at least the second lantern's left end (a[1]-d)? Actually, no: the entire gap must be covered. The first lantern covers up to a[0]+d, and the second lantern starts at a[1]-d. We require that a[0]+d >= a[1]-d? Actually, we require that the entire segment [a[0], a[1]] is covered. The first lantern covers up to a[0]+d, and the second lantern covers from a[1]-d. So we require that a[0]+d >= a[1]-d? Not exactly: we require that the first lantern's coverage extends at least to a[1]-d (so that the second lantern doesn't have to cover the gap from a[0] to a[1]-d). But actually, the entire gap [a[0], a[1]] must be covered by the union of [a[0]-d, a[0]+d] and [a[1]-d, a[1]+d]. \n\n  The critical points are:\n      - From 0 to a[0]: we require d >= a[0]\n      - From a[0] to a[1]: the gap is (a[1]-a[0]). The first lantern covers up to a[0]+d, and the second lantern starts at a[1]-d. So we require that a[0]+d >= a[1]-d -> d >= (a[1]-a[0])/2.\n      - From a[n-1] to l: we require d >= (l - a[n-1])\n\n  However, note: the condition for the left end is not just d>=a[0] because if we set d=a[0], then the first lantern covers from 0 to 2*a[0]. But wait, the first lantern is at a[0]=2, so with d=2, it covers [0,4]. That is correct.\n\n  But what if the lanterns are not equally spaced? \n\n  Algorithm:\n\n  Step 1: Sort the lantern positions.\n  Step 2: Consider the gaps:\n      gap0 = a[0]  (from 0 to the first lantern)\n      gap_end = l - a[-1]  (from the last lantern to l)\n      For i from 0 to n-2: gap_i = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n  Step 3: The required d must be at least:\n      d0 = a[0]    (to cover from 0 to the first lantern)\n      d_end = l - a[-1]   (to cover from the last lantern to l)\n\n      For each gap_i between a[i] and a[i+1]:\n          d_gap = (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.0\n\n  Then the answer is the maximum of d0, d_end, and all d_gap.\n\n  However, wait: is that sufficient? Let's test with sample 1: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n\n  First, sort the lanterns: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\n  Then:\n      d0 = 0 (since the first lantern is at 0) -> so we don't need any d for the left end?\n      But wait: the condition for the left end is that the first lantern must cover 0. Since the first lantern is at 0, then even d=0 would cover 0. However, we must cover the entire street. So the left end is covered.\n\n      Now, gaps:\n        gap0 = 0 (already covered)\n        gaps between:\n          3-0 = 3 -> d_gap = 1.5\n          5-3 = 2 -> d_gap = 1.0\n          7-5 = 2 -> d_gap = 1.0\n          9-7 = 2 -> d_gap = 1.0\n          14-9 = 5 -> d_gap = 2.5\n          15-14 = 1 -> d_gap = 0.5\n\n        d_end = 15-15 = 0\n\n      Then the maximum is 2.5.\n\n      The sample output is 2.5.\n\n  But wait, what about the left end? The first lantern is at 0, so we don't need to cover beyond 0 to the left. However, we must cover from 0 to 3. The first lantern (at 0) with d=2.5 will cover [-2.5, 2.5] but the street starts at 0, so we only care from 0 to 2.5. Then the next lantern at 3: with d=2.5, it covers [0.5, 5.5] which meets the first lantern's coverage at 0 and extends to 5.5. Then the entire street is covered.\n\n  However, note: the condition for the left end was set to a[0] (which is 0) so that's okay. But what if the first lantern isn't at 0? Then we require d >= a[0] (the distance from the first lantern to 0). In the example above, the first lantern is at 0 so that condition is 0, but the gap from 0 to 3 requires d>=1.5, and then the gap from 3 to 5 requires d>=1.0, but note: the same d must cover both. The maximum d needed is 2.5.\n\n  However, wait: is 2.5 sufficient for the entire street? \n      Lantern at 0: covers [-2.5, 2.5] -> so [0,2.5] is covered.\n      Lantern at 3: covers [0.5,5.5] -> so from 0.5 to 5.5 is covered, which includes the gap from 3 to 5.5, but note the gap between 0 and 3 is covered because the first lantern goes to 2.5 and the second starts at 0.5, so they overlap from 0.5 to 2.5.\n\n  But note: the condition for the gap between 0 and 3 is that the two lanterns must cover the entire segment [0,3]. The first lantern covers up to 2.5, and the second starts at 0.5, so the segment [0.5,2.5] is covered by both. What about [0,0.5]? The first lantern covers [0,0.5] because 0+2.5=2.5, so [0,2.5] is entirely covered by the first lantern? Actually, no: the first lantern at 0 with d=2.5 covers [0-2.5, 0+2.5] = [-2.5, 2.5]. So [0,2.5] is covered by the first lantern, and the second lantern covers from 0.5 to 5.5. The entire street [0,15] must be covered.\n\n  The issue: the second lantern at 3 with d=2.5 covers [0.5,5.5]. The point 2.5 is covered by both, and then from 2.5 to 5.5 is covered by the second lantern. But the next lantern is at 5, which is within 5.5. Then the gap between 3 and 5 is covered because the second lantern goes to 5.5 and the third lantern at 5 covers from 0 to 10 (with d=2.5: [2.5,7.5])? Actually, the third lantern at 5: [5-2.5,5+2.5] = [2.5,7.5]. So the second lantern goes to 5.5 and the third starts at 2.5, so they overlap from 2.5 to 5.5. \n\n  So the entire street is covered.\n\n  However, why did we take the gap between 0 and 3 as (3-0)/2 = 1.5? That condition is for the minimal d required for that particular gap. But note: the same d must be used for all lanterns. We are taking the maximum d required by any gap or end condition.\n\n  But wait: the condition for the gap between two consecutive lanterns is that the two lanterns must cover the entire segment between them. The condition is: d >= (gap_length)/2. This is because the midpoint of the gap must be covered by at least one lantern. The minimal d for the gap is half the gap length.\n\n  However, the entire street might require a larger d because of the edges. The edge conditions (left and right) require d to be at least the distance from the edge to the first/last lantern.\n\n  Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n      n, l = map(int, input().split())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      a.sort()\n\n      # Edge conditions\n      d_left = a[0]  # because the first lantern must cover from 0 to a[0] (so d must be at least a[0])\n      d_right = l - a[-1]\n\n      # Conditions for gaps between lanterns\n      d_max = 0.0\n      # If there are no lanterns, then we need d = l/2? But n>=1 per constraints.\n\n      # Check the left edge and the right edge\n      d_candidates = [d_left, d_right]\n\n      # Now check the gaps between consecutive lanterns\n      for i in range(len(a)-1):\n          gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n          # The required d for this gap is gap/2.0\n          d_candidates.append(gap/2.0)\n\n      # But note: the edge conditions are not necessarily the same as the gap conditions. The entire street must be lit, so we take the maximum d_candidate.\n\n      d_ans = max(d_candidates)\n\n  However, wait: is the edge condition correctly computed?\n\n      For the left edge: the first lantern is at a[0]. The light must reach 0. The distance from a[0] to 0 is a[0]. So we need d >= a[0]. Similarly, the last lantern must reach l, so d >= l - a[-1].\n\n  But consider: what if we have a lantern at 0 and then the next lantern is very far away? The edge condition for the left is 0, but the gap condition for the first gap (from 0 to the next lantern) is (next_lantern)/2. Then the answer is the maximum of 0 and (next_lantern)/2 and the other gaps and the right edge.\n\n  This matches our example.\n\n  However, there is a catch: the condition for the left edge is not just a[0] but we must also ensure that the entire street is covered from 0 to the first lantern. The first lantern must cover from 0 to a[0] (so the left edge is covered). Similarly, the last lantern must cover from a[-1] to l.\n\n  But what if we have a lantern at 0 and then a lantern at l? Then the edge conditions are 0 and 0, and the gaps are the gaps between the lanterns. The answer is the maximum gap/2.\n\n  Another example: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then:\n      d_left = 5, d_right = 5, and no gaps (since only one lantern). Then d_ans = 5.0.\n\n      With d=5, the lantern at 5 covers [0,10] (from 5-5=0 to 5+5=10). Correct.\n\n  But wait, consider: n=1, l=10, a=[0]. Then:\n      d_left = 0, d_right = 10, so d_ans = 10.0.\n\n      With d=10, the lantern at 0 covers [-10,10] -> so the street [0,10] is covered. Correct.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the street is from 0 to l. The lantern at 0 with d=10 covers [0,10] (because from 0-10=-10 to 0+10=10). So the entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n  But wait, what if the lantern is at 0 and l=10, then the condition for the right edge is 10, so we set d=10. However, is 10 the minimal? Actually, we can set d=5: because the lantern at 0 with d=5 covers [0-5,0+5] = [-5,5]. Then from 5 to 10 is not covered. So we must set d=10? Actually, no: the condition for the right edge is that the last lantern (which is at 0) must cover up to 10. So we require 0+d >= 10 -> d>=10. So indeed, we need d=10.\n\n  Alternatively, if we have one lantern at 5, then we need d=5 (as above) because the left edge requires d>=5 (to cover 0) and the right edge requires d>=5 (to cover 10). So the minimal d is 5.\n\n  So the edge conditions are correct.\n\n  However, note: the condition for the left edge is that the first lantern must cover 0. The first lantern is at a[0]. The distance from a[0] to 0 is a[0]. Therefore, we require d >= a[0]. Similarly, the condition for the right edge is that the last lantern must cover l, so the distance from a[-1] to l is (l - a[-1]), so d >= (l - a[-1]).\n\n  But wait: what if the lantern is not the first one? Actually, the array is sorted. The first element is the smallest, the last is the largest.\n\n  Therefore, the code:\n\n      n, l = map(int, input().split())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      a.sort()\n\n      # If there is only one lantern, then we have two conditions: left and right.\n      # But also, if there are multiple, we have the gaps.\n\n      candidates = []\n\n      # Left edge: from 0 to the first lantern\n      if n == 0:\n          # According to the problem, n>=1, so we skip.\n          pass\n      else:\n          # Left edge: we require d >= a[0]\n          candidates.append(a[0])\n\n      # Right edge: we require d >= l - a[-1]\n      candidates.append(l - a[-1])\n\n      # Gaps between consecutive lanterns\n      for i in range(n-1):\n          gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n          # The required d for this gap is gap/2.0\n          candidates.append(gap/2.0)\n\n      # However, note: the condition for the left edge is a[0] (the distance from the first lantern to 0) and for the right edge is (l - a[-1]).\n      # But what if the street has no gaps? Then we have only the two edges.\n\n      # The answer is the maximum value in candidates.\n\n      ans = max(candidates)\n\n      # But wait: is that always correct? Consider the example: two lanterns at [0, 10] and l=10. Then:\n      #   candidates: left edge = 0, right edge = 0, gap = (10-0)/2 = 5. Then ans=5.0.\n      #   With d=5, the first lantern (at 0) covers [-5,5] and the second (at 10) covers [5,15]. The entire street [0,10] is covered. Correct.\n\n      # However, consider: two lanterns at [0, 10] and l=20. Then:\n      #   left edge = 0, right edge = 10, gap = 5. Then ans = 10.0.\n      #   With d=10, the first lantern (at 0) covers [-10,10] and the second (at 10) covers [0,20]. The entire street [0,20] is covered. Correct.\n\n      # But wait: is 10 the minimal? \n      #   Condition for the right edge: d must be at least 10 (to cover from 10 to 20). \n      #   Condition for the gap: the gap is 10, so d must be at least 5. \n      #   Condition for the left edge: 0. So yes, 10 is the minimal.\n\n      # However, consider: three lanterns at [0, 5, 10] and l=10. Then:\n      #   left edge: 0\n      #   right edge: 0\n      #   gaps: (5-0)/2=2.5, (10-5)/2=2.5 -> so ans=2.5.\n      #   With d=2.5, the first lantern covers [-2.5,2.5] -> [0,2.5] (we only care from 0 to 10). The second lantern at 5 covers [2.5,7.5]. The third lantern at 10 covers [7.5,12.5] -> [7.5,10]. The entire street [0,10] is covered. Correct.\n\n  But wait: what if we have two lanterns at [0, 10] and l=5? Then the street is from 0 to 5. Then:\n      left edge: 0\n      right edge: 5 - 10 = -5 -> negative? \n\n  Correction: the right edge condition: the last lantern must cover up to l. The last lantern is at 10, and the street ends at 5. So we require that the last lantern's coverage (10-d) <= 5? Actually, no: the last lantern must cover from a[-1]-d to a[-1]+d, and we require that the entire street is [0,5]. The last lantern is at 10, which is beyond the street. But the condition for the right edge is that the last lantern must cover from the last lantern's position - d to ... but note: the street ends at 5. The last lantern is at 10, which is outside the street. However, we don't need the lantern to cover beyond the street? Actually, the condition is that the entire street [0,5] must be covered. The last lantern at 10 is beyond 5, so we only require that the part of the street from max(a[-1]-d, 0) to min(a[-1]+d, l) covers the part from the last lantern's coverage that falls in [0,l]. \n\n  But wait: the problem states that the street is from 0 to l. The lanterns can be located at the ends and beyond? The input says: \"0 ≤ ai ≤ l\", so the lanterns are at positions between 0 and l. Therefore, the last lantern in a sorted list is the largest, and it is <= l.\n\n  So the input constraint ensures that all lanterns are on the street. Therefore, the last lantern is at a[-1] <= l, so the right edge condition is non-negative.\n\n  Therefore, we can safely compute the right edge condition as l - a[-1].\n\n  However, note: the lanterns are given in the input with 0<=ai<=l, so we are safe.\n\n  But wait: what if the street is from 0 to l, and the last lantern is at l? Then the right edge condition is 0. Correct.\n\n  However, there is an alternative way: sometimes we might not need to cover beyond the street. But the condition is that the entire street [0,l] is covered.\n\n  Therefore, the code is:\n\n      n, l = map(int, input().split())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      a.sort()\n\n      # If there are no lanterns, then we cannot cover the street unless l==0? But n>=1 per constraints.\n\n      # We'll consider the edges and gaps.\n\n      candidates = []\n\n      # Left edge: from 0 to the first lantern\n      if n > 0:\n          candidates.append(a[0])   # d must be at least a[0] to cover the left edge\n\n      # Right edge: from the last lantern to l\n      candidates.append(l - a[-1])\n\n      # Gaps between consecutive lanterns\n      for i in range(len(a)-1):\n          gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n          # The gap must be covered by the two adjacent lanterns. The minimal d for this gap is gap/2.0.\n          candidates.append(gap/2.0)\n\n      # However, note: the condition for the left edge is a[0] (the distance from the first lantern to 0). But what if the first lantern is not the only one? Actually, the same d is used for all, so we must cover the left edge and the gaps.\n\n      # But wait: the above condition for the gap is independent. However, there is a flaw: the condition for the left edge is that the first lantern must cover the point 0. The minimal d for that is a[0]. Similarly, the condition for the gap between the first and second lantern is (a[1]-a[0])/2. But note: if a[0] is very small, then the left edge condition is small, but the gap condition might require a larger d.\n\n      # The above code does that.\n\n      # However, consider: the condition for the gap is that the two lanterns must cover the entire gap. The minimal d for the gap is (a[i+1]-a[i])/2. But the same d must be used for the entire street. Therefore, we take the maximum.\n\n      # But wait: what if the gap is very large? Then the d must be at least half the gap. However, the left edge condition might be smaller.\n\n      # Example: n=2, l=100, a=[0, 100]. Then:\n      #   left edge: 0\n      #   right edge: 0\n      #   gap: (100-0)/2 = 50\n      #   ans=50.0 -> which is correct: the first lantern covers [-50,50] and the second [50,150]. The entire street [0,100] is covered.\n\n      # However, what if the street is longer than the last lantern? Then the right edge condition (l - a[-1]) will be positive.\n\n      # So we are good.\n\n      # But note: the above code for the gaps uses the entire gap between two consecutive lanterns. However, what if the lanterns are not consecutive in the sense of the street? Actually, we sorted the lanterns, so they are consecutive.\n\n      # One more corner: if there is only one lantern, then the gaps loop runs 0 times (since n-1=0). Then we only have the two edges.\n\n      # Therefore, we can write:\n\n      ans = max(candidates) if candidates else 0.0\n\n      # Format the answer to have 9 decimal places.\n\n      print(\"{:.9f}\".format(ans))\n\n  However, wait: is the condition for the gap really (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.0? \n\n  Let me think: two lanterns at positions x and y (x<y). The entire gap from x to y must be covered. The first lantern covers [x-d, x+d] and the second covers [y-d, y+d]. The gap between x and y is (y-x). The condition for the entire gap to be covered is that the two intervals must meet or overlap. The meeting condition is that x+d >= y-d -> d >= (y-x)/2.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  But note: the same d is used for both lanterns, so we must have d at least (y-x)/2.\n\n  However, what if the gap is very small? Then (y-x)/2 is small, but the edges might require a larger d.\n\n  This is handled by taking the maximum.\n\n  But wait: what if the left edge requires d>=a0, and the gap requires d>=(a1-a0)/2, and the right edge requires d>= (l - a_last). Then the maximum of these is the answer.\n\n  However, there is a more efficient way: we can iterate and take the maximum.\n\n  But note: the edge conditions are also gaps (from 0 to the first lantern and from the last lantern to l). These are similar to gaps of length a0 and (l - a_last), but for the edges, the condition is not the same as the gap condition? \n\n  Actually, the condition for the left edge is that the first lantern must cover 0, so d >= a0. Similarly, the condition for the right edge is d >= (l - a_last). These are different from the gap conditions (which use division by 2). \n\n  However, note: the left edge can be thought of as a gap of length a0, but the condition is d >= a0, not a0/2. Similarly, the right edge is d >= (l - a_last). \n\n  Why the difference? Because for the left edge, we are only concerned with the leftmost part. The first lantern must extend at least a0 to the left to cover 0. Similarly, the last lantern must extend at least (l - a_last) to the right to cover l.\n\n  But wait, why is the gap between two consecutive lanterns only requiring d >= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2? \n\n  Explanation for the gap: the two lanterns together must cover the entire segment between them. The left lantern must extend to the meeting point, and the right lantern must extend to the meeting point. The meeting point is the midpoint. Therefore, each lantern must extend at least half the gap.\n\n  However, for the left edge, we only have one lantern (the first one) to cover the segment from 0 to a0. The first lantern must extend at least a0 to the left (so d>=a0). Similarly, for the right edge, the last lantern must extend at least (l - a_last) to the right (so d>= (l - a_last)).\n\n  Therefore, the conditions are different.\n\n  But note: the entire street is covered if:\n      - The left edge [0, a0] is covered by the first lantern (with d>=a0).\n      - The gap [a0, a1] is covered by the two lanterns (with d>= (a1-a0)/2).\n      - The gap [a1, a2] is covered (with d>= (a2-a1)/2).\n      ...\n      - The gap [a_{n-2}, a_{n-1}] is covered (with d>= (a_{n-1}-a_{n-2])/2).\n      - The right edge [a_{n-1}, l] is covered by the last lantern (with d>= (l - a_{n-1})).\n\n  So the answer is the maximum of all these values.\n\n  Therefore, the code above is correct.\n\n  However, note: the condition for the left edge is d>=a0, but what if a0 is 0? Then d>=0, which is always true. Similarly, if the last lantern is at l, then (l - a_last)=0.\n\n  Let me run the provided examples:\n\n      Example 1: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n          Sorted: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n          candidates = [0, 15-15=0, (3-0)/2=1.5, (5-3)/2=1.0, (7-5)/2=1.0, (9-7)/2=1.0, (14-9)/2=2.5, (15-14)/2=0.5]\n          max(candidates) = 2.5 -> correct.\n\n      Example 2: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n          Sorted: [2,5]\n          candidates = [2, 5-5=0, (5-2)/2=1.5] -> max=2.0? Wait, wait: 2 and 1.5 -> max(2,0,1.5)=2.0 -> correct.\n\n  But wait, in the second example, the left edge condition is 2 (so d>=2) and the gap condition is 1.5 (so d>=1.5). The maximum is 2.\n\n  However, note: the gap condition is (5-2)/2 = 1.5, but the left edge condition is 2. So the overall d is 2.\n\n  Therefore, the code is:\n\n      n, l = map(int, input().split())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      a.sort()\n\n      candidates = []\n\n      # If there is at least one lantern, add the left edge condition\n      if n > 0:\n          candidates.append(a[0])\n\n      # Add the right edge condition\n      candidates.append(l - a[-1])\n\n      # Add the gaps between consecutive lanterns\n      for i in range(n-1):\n          gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n          candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n\n      # But wait: what if n==0? The problem states n>=1, so we don't need to handle n==0.\n\n      # However, the problem says: \"The first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 10^9)\", so n>=1.\n\n      # So we can assume n>=1.\n\n      ans = max(candidates)\n\n      # Format the answer to have 9 decimal places.\n\n      print(\"{:.9f}\".format(ans))\n\n  But wait: in the example \"2 5\\n2 5\", the left edge condition is 2 (from the first lantern at 2). However, the entire street",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` required for all lanterns to illuminate the entire street from point `0` to point `l`. The lanterns are placed at specific positions along the street, and each lantern lights all points within a distance `d` from its position. The goal is to find the smallest `d` such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The street is represented as a line segment from `0` to `l`. Each lantern at position `a_i` can light the segment `[a_i - d, a_i + d]`. The challenge is to ensure that the entire street `[0, l]` is covered by the union of all these segments.\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Left Edge Coverage**: The first lantern must extend far enough to the left to cover the start of the street (point `0`). The minimal `d` required here is the distance from the first lantern to `0`, i.e., `a[0]`.\n   - **Right Edge Coverage**: Similarly, the last lantern must extend far enough to the right to cover the end of the street (point `l`). The minimal `d` here is `l - a[-1]`.\n   - **Gap Coverage**: For any two consecutive lanterns at positions `a[i]` and `a[i+1]`, the gap between them must be covered by their combined light. The minimal `d` required for this gap is `(a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves sorting the lantern positions and then computing the minimal `d` required for each edge and gap. The final answer is the maximum value among all these computed values, ensuring all parts of the street are covered.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    \n    candidates = []\n    \n    if n > 0:\n        candidates.append(a[0])\n    \n    candidates.append(l - a[-1])\n    \n    for i in range(n-1):\n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n        \n    ans = max(candidates) if candidates else 0.0\n    print(\"{:.9f}\".format(ans))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of lanterns `n`, the street length `l`, and the list of lantern positions `a`.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to process them in order from left to right.\n3. **Edge Conditions**: \n   - The left edge condition checks if the first lantern can cover the start of the street (`0`), requiring `d >= a[0]`.\n   - The right edge condition checks if the last lantern can cover the end of the street (`l`), requiring `d >= l - a[-1]`.\n4. **Gap Conditions**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the gap between them is calculated. The minimal `d` to cover this gap is half the gap length, ensuring the lanterns' light zones overlap sufficiently.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The maximum value among all edge and gap conditions is taken as the minimal `d` needed to illuminate the entire street. This value is printed with a precision of 9 decimal places.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that all parts of the street are covered by considering the critical points (edges and gaps) and selecting the largest required `d` from these scenarios.",
