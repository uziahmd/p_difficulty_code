The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the task locations)\n Since the ringroad is circular and we can only move clockwise, note that moving from house x to house y:\n   If x <= y: then the distance is (y - x) mod n? Actually, because it's circular and clockwise, but note that we can't go counterclockwise.\n   However, note: the problem says the ringroad is one-way clockwise. So from house 1, moving to house 2,3,...,n, then back to 1.\n\n But observe: the houses are numbered 1 to n in clockwise order. The movement is clockwise. Therefore, if we are at house x and want to go to house y:\n   There are two possibilities? Actually no, because we can only move clockwise. But note: the ring is circular. So the direct path from x to y is:\n      If x <= y: then we move (y - x) steps.\n      If x > y: then we move (n - x + y) steps.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time\", and the road is one-way.\n\n But wait: we start at house 1 and have multiple tasks. The condition: complete the i-th task by being at house a_i, and we must complete all tasks with numbers less than i first.\n\n Important: the tasks are given in order (from the first to the m-th). However, note that the example input: \n     Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" -> Output: 6\n     Input: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" -> Output: 2\n\n How do we compute the minimal time?\n\n Let's break down the example:\n\n Example 1: n=4, m=3, tasks = [3, 2, 3]\n\n Steps:\n   Start at 1.\n\n   For the first task at house 3:\n        From 1 to 3: \n            Option 1: 1->2->3 (2 steps)\n            Option 2: 1->4->3? But wait, the road is clockwise so you can't go from 1 to 4 by going backwards? \n            Actually, the ringroad is one-way clockwise: so the order is 1,2,3,4, then 1 again.\n\n        So from 1 to 3: we can only go 1->2->3 (which is 2 steps) or 1->2->3->4->1->2->3 (which is more). So 2 steps.\n\n   Then from 3 to 2: \n        Since we are at 3 and need to go to 2, and the ring is clockwise, we must go: 3->4->1->2. That's 3 steps.\n\n   Then from 2 to 3: \n        From 2 to 3: 2->3 (1 step)\n\n   Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.\n\n Example 2: n=4, m=3, tasks = [2, 3, 3]\n\n   Start at 1.\n\n   First task at house 2: \n        1->2: 1 step.\n\n   Then from 2 to 3: 2->3: 1 step.\n\n   Then from 3 to 3: 0 steps.\n\n   Total: 1+1+0 = 2.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" meaning that the i-th task requires being at ai and having completed all previous ones.\n\n But note: the example output for the second input is 2.\n\n Approach:\n\n We can simulate the journey by keeping track of the current house and the total time.\n\n However, note: the constraints (n, m up to 10^5) so we need an efficient solution.\n\n Let's denote:\n   current = 1 (starting house)\n   total_time = 0\n\n   For each task location a_i:\n        if current <= a_i:\n            steps = a_i - current\n        else:\n            steps = n - current + a_i   # because we go from current to the end (n) and then wrap around to 1 and then to a_i.\n\n        Then add these steps to total_time, and set current = a_i.\n\n But wait: let's test with the first example: [3,2,3]\n\n   Start: current = 1\n   Task1: a_i=3 -> steps = 3-1 = 2, total_time=2, current=3.\n   Task2: a_i=2 -> current=3, 3>2 -> steps = 4-3+2 = 3, total_time=5, current=2.\n   Task3: a_i=3 -> current=2, 2<=3 -> steps=3-2=1, total_time=6.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Now second example: [2,3,3]\n   Start: current=1\n   Task1: a_i=2 -> 2>=1, steps=2-1=1, total_time=1, current=2.\n   Task2: a_i=3 -> 3>=2, steps=3-2=1, total_time=2, current=3.\n   Task3: a_i=3 -> 0, total_time=2.\n\n   So the algorithm is:\n\n   Read n, m\n   Read the list of m integers\n\n   current = 1\n   total_time = 0\n\n   for each task in the list:\n        if current <= task:\n            steps = task - current\n        else:\n            steps = n - current + task\n\n        total_time += steps\n        current = task\n\n   Print(total_time)\n\n However, note: the problem says that we have to complete the tasks in the given order and we start at house 1.\n\n But wait: what if the same house appears consecutively? Then we don't move, so steps=0, which is correct.\n\n But consider: what if we have a long sequence of tasks that wrap around multiple times? The above calculation for a single step is correct.\n\n However, note: the example does not account for multiple wraps. But the problem states that the ringroad is circular and we are moving only clockwise.\n\n But is there a possibility that sometimes we might want to take a longer route to avoid a big jump later? \n\n Let me think: the problem condition: \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" meaning that the i-th task must be done after all previous ones.\n\n Since the tasks are given in order, we have to go from the current house to the next task's house. And because the road is one-way, the minimal path is always the clockwise path.\n\n Therefore, the above algorithm is correct.\n\n However, note: the problem constraints are up to 10^5, so we must use an efficient method (O(m)).\n\n But wait: is there any issue with the modulo arithmetic? Actually, the above calculation is just two cases.\n\n Let me test with a different example: n=5, tasks=[5,1,2]\n\n   Start at 1.\n\n   Task1: 5 -> from 1 to 5: 5-1=4, total_time=4, current=5.\n   Task2: 1 -> from 5 to 1: 5>1 -> steps = 5-5+1 = 1, total_time=5, current=1.\n   Task3: 2 -> from 1 to 2: 2-1=1, total_time=6.\n\n   Alternatively, we could consider: from 5 to 1, is 1 step (clockwise: 5->1) because after 5 comes 1.\n\n   But wait: the ringroad has n houses. After house n comes house 1. So the distance from 5 to 1 in a ring of 5: \n        clockwise: 5->1: that's 1 step? Actually, from 5, the next house is 1 (since it's circular). So the distance from 5 to 1 is 1.\n\n   Our formula for when current > task: \n        steps = n - current + task\n        Here, n=5, current=5, task=1: 5-5+1 = 1 -> correct.\n\n   Another example: n=5, tasks=[5,4,3,2,1]\n\n        Start at 1.\n\n        Task1: 5 -> 5-1=4, total_time=4, current=5.\n        Task2: 4 -> 5>4 -> steps=5-5+4=4, total_time=8, current=4.\n        Task3: 3 -> 4>3 -> steps=5-4+3=4, total_time=12, current=3.\n        Task4: 2 -> 3>2 -> steps=5-3+2=4, total_time=16, current=2.\n        Task5: 1 -> 2>1 -> steps=5-2+1=4, total_time=20.\n\n        Alternatively, we can also consider: \n          1->5: 4 steps (then from 5 to 4: 1 step? Actually no: from 5 to 4: in clockwise, we have to go 5->1->2->3->4? That would be 4 steps? \n          But wait: the ring is circular and clockwise. From 5, the next house is 1, then 2, then 3, then 4. So 5->1->2->3->4: that's 4 steps.\n\n        So our formula gives 4 steps for 5->4, which is correct.\n\n   However, note: the example n=5, tasks=[5,4,3,2,1] should be 4 (from 1 to 5) + 4 (from 5 to 4) + 4 (from 4 to 3) + 4 (from 3 to 2) + 4 (from 2 to 1) = 20.\n\n   But wait, is there a shorter way? No, because we must go from 5 to 4 in a clockwise manner: we must pass through 1,2,3, so 4 steps.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   current = 1\n   total_time = 0\n\n   for t in tasks:\n        if current <= t:\n            total_time += t - current\n        else:\n            total_time += n - current + t\n        current = t\n\n   print(total_time)\n\n However, note: the example input format may have multiple test cases? The problem statement says \"The first line contains two integers n and m\", so only one test case per run.\n\n But wait, the example input provided was two separate examples. The problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem\" and then the example.\n\n But the input specification says: \n      The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am.\n\n So we assume one test case.\n\n Let me run the provided examples:\n\n   Example 1: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" -> 6\n   Example 2: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" -> 2\n\n   The code above produces 6 and 2 respectively.\n\n   However, wait: the example input was given as two separate strings? Actually, the example input is:\n\n        ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Input\" and then two examples. In competitive programming, the input is read from stdin.\n\n   We'll read from stdin.\n\n   But note: the problem constraints say that the numbers can be up to 10^5, so using int conversion is safe.\n\n   However, there is a potential issue: the formula for the else part: n - current + t\n\n   But note: current and t are between 1 and n. When current > t, then n - current + t is positive and less than n (if we consider the circle) but actually:\n\n        The minimal clockwise steps from current to t is (t - current) mod n, but taken in the positive direction? \n\n        Actually, the minimal clockwise distance from x to y is (y - x) % n, but if negative we adjust.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write: \n            steps = (t - current) % n   but this doesn't work for negative.\n\n        We can use: \n            steps = (t - current) % n   but if (t - current) is negative, then (t - current) % n would be (t - current + n) % n, but then we don't want the modulus to give a value in [0, n-1] but we want the actual steps.\n\n        However, note: the modulus approach doesn't directly give the steps we need. We need the actual number of steps, which is the positive difference in the circular way.\n\n        Our if-else is equivalent to: \n            if current <= t: steps = t - current\n            else: steps = (t + n - current)   [because n - current + t]\n\n        Which is the same as: steps = (t - current) % n   but wait: if t < current, then (t - current) % n = (t - current + n) % n, and since t - current is negative, adding n makes it positive and then mod n? \n\n        Actually, the modulus operation in Python for negative: \n            (t - current) % n = (t - current + n) % n   because we add enough multiples of n to make it non-negative.\n\n        But note: we don't want the modulus, we want the actual steps. However, the modulus result is the same as the minimal clockwise steps? \n\n        Let me check: \n            n=4, current=3, t=2: \n                (2-3) % 4 = (-1) % 4 = 3 (in Python, because -1 + 4 = 3, and 3 % 4 = 3). \n                But our formula gives 3, which is correct.\n\n            n=4, current=1, t=3: \n                (3-1) % 4 = 2 % 4 = 2, which is correct.\n\n            n=4, current=4, t=1: \n                (1-4) % 4 = (-3) % 4 = 1, which is correct.\n\n        So we can also write:\n\n            steps = (t - current) % n\n            BUT: if (t - current) is negative, then we get a positive number by adding n until non-negative, and then take modulus. However, note that (t - current) % n gives the minimal non-negative residue, which is exactly the clockwise steps if we consider the circle.\n\n        However, wait: what if we do modulus and then if the result is 0? Actually, if t==current, then (t-current)%n =0, which is correct.\n\n        But note: the modulus gives the minimal positive representation, but the steps in the clockwise direction from current to t is (t - current) mod n, but wait: \n\n            In modular arithmetic, the clockwise steps from current to t is (t - current) mod n, but if we define the modulus to be the smallest non-negative remainder, then yes.\n\n        However, note: in a circle, the clockwise distance from current to t is defined as (t - current) mod n, but if (t - current) is negative, then (t - current) mod n = n + (t - current). \n\n        So we can write:\n\n            steps = (t - current) % n\n            But wait: if (t - current) is positive, then (t - current) % n might be less than (t - current) if (t - current) >= n? \n\n        Example: n=4, current=1, t=5 (but t is between 1 and n, so t cannot be 5). So we are safe because t is in [1, n].\n\n        Therefore, because t is in [1, n] and current is in [1, n], then (t - current) is in [-n+1, n-1]. \n\n        Then (t - current) % n will give a value in [0, n-1]. But note: when t>=current, (t-current) % n = t-current, which is the direct steps (and t-current is at most n-1).\n\n        When t<current, (t-current) % n = t - current + n, and since t>=1 and current<=n, then t - current + n >= 1 - n + n = 1, and <= n-1 - 1 + n = 2*n-2, but then modulus n? Actually, we don't need modulus because we are only concerned with the positive representation.\n\n        However, wait: the modulus operation for negative: \n            (t - current) % n = t - current + n   if t - current is negative and we are in the range where adding n once makes it non-negative.\n\n        But note: t - current is negative and |t - current| < n (since t>=1, current<=n, the maximum negative is (1-n) and then 1-n+n=1, and minimum negative is (1-n) and then adding n gives 1, so we get a number between 1 and n-1).\n\n        Actually, the modulus operation in this case gives the same as our if-else.\n\n        So we can replace:\n\n            if current <= t:\n                steps = t - current\n            else:\n                steps = n - current + t\n\n        by:\n\n            steps = (t - current) % n\n            if steps == 0:\n                # Actually, if t==current, then (t - current) % n is 0, but we want 0 steps.\n                # However, the modulus operation returns 0 when t==current, which is correct.\n                # But wait: if t==current, then (t - current) % n is 0, and that's the correct step count (0).\n                # However, our original if-else would have gone the if branch and computed 0, so same.\n\n        But wait: the modulus operation for (t - current) % n when t==current gives 0, which is correct.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation in Python for positive and negative is defined such that the result is in [0, n-1]. \n\n        But the problem: the steps from current to t should be the minimal clockwise steps. And the modulus operation gives the minimal positive representation, which is the clockwise steps.\n\n        However, wait: the clockwise steps from current to t is (t - current) mod n, but if we consider the circle, the clockwise distance is (t - current) if t>=current, and (t - current + n) if t<current.\n\n        And that is exactly (t - current) % n (with the modulus operation returning the least non-negative residue).\n\n        But note: the modulus operation does not return the minimal positive representation for the entire circle? Actually, in a circle of n, the clockwise distance from x to y is (y - x) mod n, but if the result is 0, then they are the same.\n\n        However, wait: the modulus operation in mathematics for negative numbers is defined as: \n            a % b = a - b * floor(a/b)\n\n        But in our case, we want the clockwise distance to be the smallest non-negative integer d such that (current + d) mod n = t.\n\n        The equation: (current + d) mod n = t   => d = (t - current) mod n.\n\n        So yes, the modulus operation gives the correct d.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers does give the same result as (t - current + k*n) for the smallest k such that the result is non-negative.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            steps = (t - current) % n\n\n        However, wait: if (t - current) is negative, then (t - current) % n = t - current + n, which is the same as our else branch.\n\n        But what if (t - current) is positive and greater than or equal to n? Then (t - current) % n would be (t - current) - n * floor((t - current)/n). But note t and current are in [1, n], so (t - current) is in [-n+1, n-1]. \n\n        Therefore, if (t - current) is positive, then it is at most n-1, so (t - current) % n = t - current.\n\n        And if negative, then (t - current) % n = t - current + n.\n\n        So we can simply do:\n\n            steps = (t - current) % n\n\n        But wait: what if (t - current) is negative and we add n, and then if that value is still negative? \n\n        Example: n=4, current=3, t=1: \n            t - current = 1-3 = -2\n            -2 % 4 = 2 (because -2 + 4 = 2, and 2 % 4 = 2)\n\n        But wait, from 3 to 1: \n            We have two options: \n                Option1: 3->4->1: 2 steps (correct)\n                Option2: 3->4->1->2->3->4->1: 5 steps, but we take the minimal.\n\n        So the modulus gives 2, which is correct.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers is defined to return a result in [0, n-1]. \n\n        Therefore, we can simplify the code to:\n\n            steps = (t - current) % n\n\n        But wait: what if the modulus is 0? Then steps=0, which is correct.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation returns 0 when (t - current) is divisible by n. But since t and current are in [1, n], then (t - current) divisible by n only if t==current (then 0) or if t - current is a multiple of n, but the absolute value is at most n-1, so the only multiple is 0.\n\n        So we can use:\n\n            steps = (t - current) % n\n\n        But wait: the modulus operation returns a value in [0, n-1]. However, note that the clockwise steps from current to t should be the smallest non-negative integer d such that (current + d) mod n = t.\n\n        And that is exactly (t - current) % n.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation is defined for positive n, and we are using it correctly.\n\n        But wait: the problem says that the ringroad is circular and the movement is clockwise. The modulus gives the minimal steps.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            current = 1\n            total_time = 0\n\n            for t in tasks:\n                steps = (t - current) % n\n                # But wait: if (t - current) is negative, then (t - current) % n = t - current + n, which is the same as our else branch.\n                # However, note: what if (t - current) is positive? Then steps = t - current, which is the same as our if branch.\n\n                # But wait: what if (t - current) is positive and very large? But t and current are in [1, n], so (t - current) is at most n-1, so modulus n is the same.\n\n                # However, note: the modulus operation is defined for any integer, but here the absolute value is at most n-1, so modulus n is the same as the positive difference.\n\n                # But wait: the modulus operation for positive numbers less than n: (t - current) % n = t - current, because t - current < n (if positive) and >=0.\n\n                # However, what if (t - current) is negative? Then we add n until non-negative, and then take modulus? Actually, the modulus operation in Python does that.\n\n                # But note: the modulus operation does not necessarily give the minimal steps? It gives the minimal non-negative solution for d in the equation (current + d) ≡ t (mod n). \n\n                # And in our case, the minimal steps in the clockwise direction is indeed that minimal non-negative solution.\n\n                total_time += steps\n                current = t\n\n            print(total_time)\n\n        However, wait: is that correct? Let's test with the examples:\n\n        Example 1: n=4, tasks=[3,2,3]\n\n            Start: current=1\n\n            t=3: steps = (3-1)%4 = 2%4=2 -> correct.\n            t=2: steps = (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4=3 -> correct.\n            t=3: steps = (3-2)%4=1%4=1 -> correct.\n\n            Total_time=2+3+1=6.\n\n        Example 2: n=4, tasks=[2,3,3]\n\n            Start: current=1\n\n            t=2: steps=(2-1)%4=1 -> correct.\n            t=3: steps=(3-2)%4=1 -> correct.\n            t=3: steps=0 -> correct.\n\n            Total_time=2.\n\n        But wait: the example [5,4,3,2,1] for n=5:\n\n            Start: current=1\n\n            t=5: (5-1)%5=4 -> correct.\n            t=4: (4-5)%5= ( -1 ) %5 =4 -> correct (because from 5 to 4: 5->1->2->3->4: 4 steps)\n            t=3: (3-4)%5= -1%5=4 -> correct (from 4 to 3: 4->5->1->2->3: 4 steps)\n            t=2: (2-3)%5=-1%5=4 -> correct\n            t=1: (1-2)%5=-1%5=4 -> correct\n\n            Total_time=4*5=20.\n\n        So both methods are equivalent.\n\n        Why did the modulus method work for the negative case? Because the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers adds the modulus until the result is non-negative.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation for negative numbers in Python returns a result in [0, n-1]. But the clockwise steps should be in [0, n-1] because if we have to go from current to t, the maximum steps we can take is n-1 (if we go almost a full circle).\n\n        Therefore, we can use the modulus method.\n\n        But wait: is there a catch? Consider the starting point: initially current=1, and we update current to t at the end of each iteration.\n\n        The modulus method is simpler and avoids the if-else.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation for (t - current) might be negative and then we add n, but that's the same as our else branch.\n\n        But there is one more thing: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers is well-defined, so we can rely on it.\n\n        However, note: the problem constraints say n and m can be up to 10^5, and the modulus operation is O(1), so it's efficient.\n\n        But wait: what if n is 10^5 and the numbers are 10^5? Then (t - current) can be negative (if t is 1 and current is 10^5) then (1-100000) % 100000 = (1-100000 + 100000) % 100000 = 1 % 100000 = 1.\n\n        So that's correct.\n\n        However, wait: the modulus operation for negative numbers is defined to return a non-negative result less than n, which is the minimal positive steps.\n\n        Therefore, we can use the modulus method.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation is more computationally heavy? Actually, for integers, modulus is O(1) for fixed size, and we have m up to 10^5, so it's acceptable.\n\n        Let me compare the two:\n\n            Original if-else:\n\n                if current <= t:\n                    steps = t - current\n                else:\n                    steps = n - current + t\n\n            Modulus:\n\n                steps = (t - current) % n\n\n        They are equivalent.\n\n        However, wait: the modulus operation for positive (t - current) that is less than n is just t - current, so it's the same.\n\n        But wait: what if (t - current) is positive and greater than or equal to n? \n\n        Example: n=5, current=1, t=6? But t is guaranteed to be in [1, n] (from the input). So t is at most n, and current is at least 1, so (t - current) is at most n-1 (if t=n and current=1, then n-1) and at least 1-n (if t=1 and current=n, then 1-n). \n\n        Therefore, the modulus operation is safe.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation for negative numbers: \n            (t - current) % n = t - current + n   (if t - current is negative and we add n once, then it becomes positive and less than n? Actually, if t - current is negative, then adding n once is enough to make it in [0, n-1] because the smallest t - current is 1-n, then 1-n+n=1, and the largest negative is n-1-n = -1, then -1+n = n-1.\n\n        So we can use the modulus method.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation might be slightly slower than the if-else, but for clarity and avoiding conditionals, we can choose either.\n\n        However, the problem says to write efficient code. The modulus operation is a single operation and the if-else is two comparisons and one subtraction. But modulus for negative numbers might involve a division and then multiplication? \n\n        Actually, the modulus operation for integers in Python is efficient, but we are dealing with numbers that are at most 10^5, so the modulus operation is cheap.\n\n        But note: the problem constraints are 10^5, so 10^5 modulus operations is nothing.\n\n        I'll use the modulus method for simplicity.\n\n        However, wait: there's a catch. The modulus operation in Python for negative numbers returns a non-negative result. But note: the modulus operation does not necessarily give the minimal positive steps in terms of the circle? \n\n        Let me clarify: the equation (current + d) mod n = t has solutions d = (t - current) mod n and d = (t - current) mod n + k*n for any integer k. The minimal non-negative d is (t - current) mod n.\n\n        And the minimal steps is d.\n\n        Therefore, the modulus method is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if we have to go from current to t, and the modulus operation returns a value that is the minimal positive solution, but is that the same as the clockwise steps? \n\n        Yes, because the clockwise steps are the minimal non-negative d such that (current + d) mod n = t.\n\n        However, note: the ringroad is circular, and the clockwise movement is defined as moving one house per step. So the minimal steps is d.\n\n        Therefore, we can use modulus.\n\n        But wait: the modulus operation for positive numbers is the same as the direct steps, and for negative we get the wrap-around steps.\n\n        So the code becomes:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            current = 1\n            total_time = 0\n            for t in tasks:\n                steps = (t - current) % n\n                # But wait: what if steps==0? Then we don't move, which is correct.\n                total_time += steps\n                current = t\n            print(total_time)\n\n        However, wait: there is a subtle issue. The modulus operation is defined for the entire equation (current + d) mod n = t, but note that the modulus operation does not account for the fact that the circle has n houses. \n\n        Actually, the modulus operation is correct because:\n\n            We are representing the houses modulo n, but note: the houses are labeled 1 to n.\n\n        However, wait: the modulus operation for house labels: \n\n            We have houses 1 to n. We can map them to 0 to n-1? \n\n            But note: the modulus operation in the above formula is done on the integers (the house numbers). \n\n        But the problem: the distance from house x to house y in a circle of n houses (labeled 1..n) is (y - x) mod n, but wait: \n\n            Example: from house 4 (n=4) to house 1: \n                (1 - 4) % 4 = (-3) % 4 = 1, which is correct.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation is defined on the integers, and the house labels are 1-indexed. The modulus operation does not require 0-indexing.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        But wait: why did the modulus method work for the example [5,4,3,2,1] with n=5? \n\n            From 1 to 5: (5-1)%5=4 -> correct.\n            From 5 to 4: (4-5)%5= (-1)%5=4 -> correct.\n\n        However, wait: the modulus operation for (4-5) is -1, and -1 %5 = 4. \n\n        But note: the equation (5 + 4) mod 5 = 9 mod5 = 4, which is the target house 4. Correct.\n\n        Similarly, from 4 to 3: (3-4)%5=-1%5=4 -> (4+4)=8 mod5=3 -> correct.\n\n        Therefore, the modulus method is correct.\n\n        However, wait: the problem says that the ringroad has houses 1 to n. The modulus operation is defined for the integers, and the house numbers are in the range [1, n]. \n\n        There is one more consideration: what if the modulus operation returns 0? Then steps=0, which is correct for consecutive same houses.\n\n        Therefore, we can use the modulus method.\n\n        But wait: there is an alternative without modulus. The modulus operation might be considered less clear.\n\n        Given that the problem constraints are high but the modulus operation is efficient, and we are allowed to use modulus, we can use the modulus.\n\n        However, let me check the performance: modulus is a constant-time operation for integers of bounded size (here, n up to 10^5, so the numbers are up to 10^5, and the modulus is n which is 10^5). The modulus operation for integers of size about 10^5 is O(1) in practice.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation for negative numbers: \n            In Python, the modulus operation for negative numbers is defined as:\n\n                a % b = a - b * floor(a/b)\n\n            For a=-1, b=4: floor(-1/4) = floor(-0.25) = -1, so (-1 %4) = -1 - 4*(-1) = -1 +4=3.\n\n            But wait, in our example we got 3, but we expected 3 steps? Actually, the example was n=4, current=3, t=2: (2-3) %4 = (-1)%4=3, which is correct.\n\n        So the modulus operation is defined as above.\n\n        But wait: the equation (current + d) mod n = t is satisfied by d = (t - current) % n? \n\n            (3 + 3) %4 = 6 %4 = 2, which is the target t=2. Correct.\n\n        Therefore, the modulus method is correct.\n\n        However, note: there is a potential pitfall: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers does return a non-negative result, but the minimal steps in the clockwise direction is always the same as (t - current) % n.\n\n        So we'll use the modulus method.\n\n        But wait: the problem says that the houses are 1-indexed. The modulus operation uses the house numbers as integers. \n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation does not change the meaning of the house numbers. We are just using the integer values.\n\n        Therefore, the final code:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            cur = 1\n            ans = 0\n            for a in arr:\n                # Calculate the clockwise steps from cur to a\n                ans += (a - cur) % n\n                cur = a\n            print(ans)\n\n        But wait: let's test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: n=4, arr=[3,2,3]\n\n            Step1: a=3 -> (",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad. The ringroad consists of `n` houses numbered from 1 to `n` in clockwise order, and movement is only allowed in the clockwise direction. Each move between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete `m` tasks in sequence. Each task requires her to be at a specific house. The challenge is to calculate the minimal time required to move from her current house to the next task's house, considering the circular nature of the ringroad.\n2. **Key Insight**: The minimal time to move from house `current` to house `task` in a clockwise direction can be computed using modulo arithmetic. Specifically, the steps required is `(task - current) % n`. This formula accounts for both direct moves (when `task >= current`) and wrap-around moves (when `task < current`).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We iterate through each task, compute the steps needed from the current house to the task's house using the modulo operation, accumulate the total time, and update the current house to the task's location. This approach efficiently handles all edge cases, including consecutive tasks in the same house or tasks that require wrapping around the ringroad.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each task exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(m), which is optimal given the constraints (m ≤ 10^5). The space complexity is O(1) as we only store the current house and total time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor t in tasks:\n    steps = (t - current) % n\n    total_time += steps\n    current = t\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Read the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. Then read the list of task locations.\n2. **Processing Tasks**: For each task location `t`:\n   - Calculate the steps needed to move from the current house to `t` using `(t - current) % n`. This handles both direct moves (when `t` is ahead of `current`) and wrap-around moves (when `t` is behind `current` in the clockwise direction).\n   - Add the computed steps to the total time.\n   - Update the current house to `t`.\n3. **Output**: After processing all tasks, print the total time taken.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal time by leveraging modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
