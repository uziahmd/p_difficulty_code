The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem.\n\nWe have n+2 towns (0 to n+1). We build towers in towns 1 to n with probability 1/2 (each independently). Then we set signal powers (from 1 to n) for each tower.\n\nConstraints:\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 must not get any signal.\n2. Each town i (for i from 1 to n) must be covered by exactly one tower.\n\nThe idea:\n\nWe are to compute the probability that there exists an assignment of signal powers (each at least 1) such that:\n - The tower in town i (if built) has a power p_i (an integer >=1) and the condition |c - i| < p_i is satisfied for exactly the intended towns.\n\nNote: The condition |c - i| < p_i can be rewritten as: the tower at i covers all towns from (i-p_i+1) to (i+p_i-1). But note that the condition is strict: it must cover the town and not go beyond? Actually, the condition is that the signal reaches every city c such that |c-i| < p_i. So if we set p_i = x, then the tower at i covers [i-x+1, i+x-1] (but note: the endpoints are excluded? Actually, the condition is |c-i| < p_i, so c must be strictly between i-p_i and i+p_i. However, the towns are integers. So the coverage of a tower at i with power p is the set { j : |j-i| < p } = { j : i-p < j < i+p }.\n\nBut note: the example: n=5, tower at 2 with p=2: then it covers |c-2| < 2 -> c from 0 to 4? But wait, the example says: \n  towns 1,2,3 are covered by the tower at 2. \nActually, let's check: \n  For town 1: |1-2| = 1 < 2 -> yes.\n  For town 2: |2-2| = 0 < 2 -> yes.\n  For town 3: |3-2| = 1 < 2 -> yes.\n  For town 0: |0-2| = 2 which is not <2 -> no.\n  For town 4: |4-2|=2 -> no.\n\nSo the coverage is [i-p+1, i+p-1] (the integers j such that j>=i-p+1 and j<=i+p-1) but wait: \n  Condition: |j-i| < p  <=>  -p < j-i < p  <=> i-p < j < i+p.\nSince j is integer, then j from floor(i-p)+1 to ceil(i+p)-1? Actually, because j must be integer, the smallest j is i-p+1 (if we take the next integer above i-p) and the largest j is i+p-1.\n\nBut note: the problem says the towns are located at integer coordinates, so j is integer.\n\nNow, constraints:\n  - Town 0 must not be covered by any tower: meaning for every built tower at position i, we must have that 0 is not in the interval (i-p, i+p). This is equivalent to: either the tower doesn't exist, or if it does then p must be chosen so that 0 is not covered. Similarly for town n+1.\n\n  - For each town i (from 1 to n), it must be covered by exactly one tower. Note that a town might be covered by multiple towers if we don't choose the powers appropriately, so we have to assign powers so that each town gets exactly one.\n\nMoreover, note that the problem does not require that the same tower cannot cover multiple towns? Actually, the constraint is that each town (from 1 to n) must be covered by exactly one tower. This means that if two towers both cover a town, then we cannot satisfy the condition.\n\nTherefore, the assignment must ensure that the coverage sets for the built towers are disjoint and exactly cover the towns 1 to n.\n\nHow to think about the problem?\n\nLet S be the set of built towers (each tower is at a town from 1 to n). We need to assign a positive integer p_i to each tower i in S such that:\n  1. The entire set of towns 1 to n is covered (each exactly once).\n  2. Town 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\nMoreover, note that the coverage of a tower at i with power p_i is the open interval (i-p_i, i+p_i) (in terms of integer points). Since the coverage must be disjoint and cover [1, n], we can think of the towers as covering contiguous segments",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in some towns (from 1 to n) with independent probability 1/2 each, there exists a way to set signal powers for these towers such that:\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 are not covered by any tower.\n2. Each town from 1 to n is covered by exactly one tower.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - The key observation is that the problem can be reduced to checking whether the built towers can form a valid coverage pattern where each town from 1 to n is covered by exactly one tower without overlapping or covering the endpoints (0 and n+1).\n   - The solution involves dynamic programming (DP) where we consider the inclusion of each town as a potential tower site and compute the probability of forming valid segments.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:\n   - We use a DP array `dp[i]` which represents the probability that the segment from 1 to i can be covered by the towers built up to town i, satisfying all constraints.\n   - The recurrence relation involves considering whether to include the current town as a tower or not, and ensuring that the coverage does not overlap with previous segments.\n\n3. **Modulo Handling**:\n   - Since the result needs to be modulo 998244353, we handle all operations under this modulus, including division by powers of 2 using modular inverses.\n\n4. **Final Probability Calculation**:\n   - The answer is derived from `dp[n]`, which gives the probability that towns 1 to n are covered correctly, and then adjusted to ensure towns 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    n = int(data[0])\n    \n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    \n    inv2 = pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        ways_without_tower = dp[i - 1]\n        ways_with_tower = 0\n        for j in range(i - 1, 0, -1):\n            if dp[j] != 0:\n                break\n        else:\n            j = 0\n        \n        seg_length = i - j\n        if seg_length < 1:\n            continue\n        min_power = seg_length\n        ways_with_tower = dp[j] * pow(inv2, i, MOD) % MOD\n        ways_with_tower = ways_with_tower * pow(2, min_power - 1, MOD) % MOD\n        \n        dp[i] = (ways_without_tower + ways_with_tower) % MOD\n    \n    ans = dp[n] * pow(pow(2, n, MOD), MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `dp[0]` is initialized to 1 because the base case (no towns processed) has a probability of 1.\n\n2. **DP Array Processing**:\n   - For each town `i` from 1 to n, we calculate two scenarios:\n     - **Without Tower**: The probability remains the same as `dp[i-1]`.\n     - **With Tower**: We determine the minimal segment length required to cover from the last considered town to `i`. The probability is updated by considering the inclusion of the tower and ensuring no overlaps.\n\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**:\n   - Division by powers of 2 is handled using modular inverses (computed via Fermat's Little Theorem) to stay within the modulo constraints.\n\n4. **Result Calculation**:\n   - The final result is derived from `dp[n]`, adjusted by the inverse of the total number of possible tower configurations (2^n) modulo 998244353.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired probability using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
