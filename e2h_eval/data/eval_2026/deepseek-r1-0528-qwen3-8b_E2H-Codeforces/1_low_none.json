Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The problem states that the plate is a rectangle of size w x h (rows x columns).\n We are to add k gilded rings. The first ring goes along the edge, the second 2 cells away, etc.\n\n For the i-th ring (starting at i=1), the ring is drawn on the inner rectangle of size:\n   w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n   h_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n But note: if at any step the inner rectangle has width or height less than 2 (so that we can form a ring of at least one cell per side?),\n then we cannot draw that ring. However, the input constraint ensures k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4).\n\n The ring has a width of 1 cell. The number of cells in the i-th ring is the perimeter of the inner rectangle?\n Actually, the ring is defined as the bordering cells of the inner rectangle. So for an inner rectangle of size a x b (a and b are the dimensions after removing 2*(i-1) from each side? Actually, we remove 4*(i-1) from the original, which means we removed 2*(i-1) from top and bottom and 2*(i-1) from left and right.\n\n But note: the example: \n   Input: \"3 3 1\" -> Output: 8. \n   The plate is 3x3. The first ring uses the entire border. The border of a 3x3 grid: \n        Top row: 3 cells, bottom row: 3 cells, left column (without the corners already counted): 3-2 = 1, right column: 3-2=1 -> total 3+3+1+1 = 8.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the perimeter of the inner rectangle for the first ring: \n   The inner rectangle for the first ring is the original plate? Actually, the problem says: \n        \"the first one should go along the edge of the plate\"\n\n   Then the second ring: 2 cells away from the edge. So the inner rectangle for the second ring is (w-4) x (h-4). But wait, the example: \n        Input: \"7 9 2\" -> Output: 40.\n\n   How do we get 40?\n   First ring: \n        Original plate: 7x9\n        Perimeter = 2*(7 + 9) - 4 = 2*16 - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28? But wait, actually we have to account for the fact that the corners are shared.\n\n   Alternatively, note the example drawing: \n        The first ring: the outer border of the 7x9 plate. The border has:\n          Top: 7, Bottom: 7, Left: 9-2 = 7, Right: 9-2 = 7? That doesn't add up.\n\n   Actually, the standard way to compute the border of an a x b grid is: \n        If a >= 2 and b >= 2, then the border has: \n          top: a, bottom: a, left: b-2, right: b-2? \n\n   But wait, that would be: 2*a + 2*(b-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n   However, the example 3x3: 2*3 + 2*3 - 4 = 6+6-4 = 8 -> correct.\n\n   For the 7x9: \n        First ring: 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 28.\n\n   Then the second ring: \n        The inner rectangle is (7-4) x (9-4) = 3x5.\n        Now, if we try to form a ring on a 3x5 rectangle, we need to check: \n          The border of a 3x5: \n          Top: 3, Bottom: 3, Left: 5-2 = 3, Right: 5-2 = 3 -> but wait, the formula above would give: 2*3 + 2*5 - 4 = 6+10-4=12.\n        Then total = 28 + 12 = 40 -> matches.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. In the 7x9, that leaves a 3x5 inner rectangle. But is the ring for 3x5 having 12 cells?\n\n   Let's break down the 3x5:\n        We",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. The first ring is placed along the edge of the plate, and each subsequent ring is placed 2 cells away from the previous one. Each ring has a width of 1 cell. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that each ring corresponds to the border of an inner rectangle formed by reducing the original dimensions by 4 cells (2 cells from each side) for each subsequent ring. The number of cells in each ring is calculated using the perimeter of the corresponding inner rectangle, adjusted to account for shared corners.\n2. **Insight**: For an inner rectangle of size \\(a \\times b\\), the number of cells in its border is \\(2a + 2b - 4\\). This formula efficiently computes the border cells by considering the top and bottom rows (each contributing `a` cells) and the left and right columns (each contributing `b-2` cells to avoid double-counting corners).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves iterating over each ring from 1 to k, adjusting the dimensions of the plate for each ring, and summing the cells of each ring's border. The dimensions for the i-th ring are derived by subtracting \\(4(i-1)\\) from both the width and height of the original plate.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(k) time, where k is the number of rings. Since k is constrained by the input to be at most \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\min(w, h) + 1}{4} \\right\\rfloor\\), the solution is efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total_cells = 0\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        new_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n        new_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n        if new_w <= 0 or new_h <= 0:\n            break\n        if new_w == 1 or new_h == 1:\n            ring_cells = new_w * new_h\n        else:\n            ring_cells = 2 * (new_w + new_h) - 4\n        total_cells += ring_cells\n    print(total_cells)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: `w` (width), `h` (height), and `k` (number of rings).\n2. **Initialization**: `total_cells` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the sum of cells in all rings.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k:\n   - **Adjust Dimensions**: The dimensions of the current ring's inner rectangle are calculated by reducing the original dimensions by \\(4(i-1)\\) cells (2 cells from each side).\n   - **Check Validity**: If the adjusted dimensions become non-positive, the loop breaks as further rings are not possible.\n   - **Calculate Ring Cells**: For valid dimensions, the number of cells in the ring is computed using the formula \\(2(a + b) - 4\\) if both dimensions are greater than 1. If either dimension is 1, the product of the dimensions gives the correct cell count (since a single row or column has no inner border).\n4. **Output Result**: The total number of cells across all rings is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required cells by leveraging geometric properties of rectangles and their borders, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.",
