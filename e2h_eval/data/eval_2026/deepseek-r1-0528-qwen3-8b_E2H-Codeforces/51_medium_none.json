Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from standard input.\n The idea is:\n 1. Combine the first two strings (guest name and host name) and count the total frequency of each letter.\n 2. Compare the total frequency with the frequency of letters in the third string (the pile).\n 3. If the frequencies match exactly, then we output \"YES\", otherwise \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the problem says the pile should be able to form the two names without any extra or missing letters.\n\n Steps:\n - Read the three lines.\n - Concatenate the first two lines (strip newline characters if present) to form a string that should be built by the pile.\n - Count the frequency of each character in the concatenated string and in the third string (the pile).\n - Check if the two frequency counts are the same.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n      SANTACLAUS\n      DEDMOROZ\n      SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   The combined string of the first two is \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\". But wait, the example input is given as three separate lines, and the example output is \"YES\".\n\n   Actually, looking at the example: \n        guest's name: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        host's name: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Let me check: \n        Combined expected string = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" -> but wait, the pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\". \n\n   Actually, the example input provided is:\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   Wait, the example input is given as a list of three strings? But actually, the problem states:\n\n        The first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile.\n\n   So, the input is three lines.\n\n   In the example, the first line is \"SANTACLAUS\", the second is \"DEDMOROZ\", and the third is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\".\n\n   Now, the combined string for the names is \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\", but the pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\". \n\n   Let me break down the pile: \n        \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" has 15 letters, and \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" has 13 + 8 = 21? That doesn't match.\n\n   Wait, let me count the lengths:\n\n        Guest: \"SANTACLAUS\" -> 10 letters\n        Host: \"DEDMOROZ\" -> 8 letters\n        Total expected: 18 letters.\n\n   But the pile \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" has 16 letters? \n\n   Actually, let me count again:\n\n        Guest: S A N T A C L A U S -> 10\n        Host: D E D M O R O Z -> 8\n        Total: 18\n\n        Pile: S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S -> Let's count: \n            S: appears 2 (first and last)\n            A: 2\n            N: 1\n            T: 1\n            M: 1\n            O: 2\n            R: 1\n            Z: 1\n            D: 2\n            E: 1\n            C: 1\n            L: 1\n            U: 1\n\n        That's 2+2+1+1+1+2+1+1+2+1+1+1+1 = 17? \n\n   But wait, the example input is given as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n   Actually, the example input is a list of three strings. The first string is \"SANTACLAUS\", the second is \"DEDMOROZ\", and the third is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\".\n\n   And the example output is \"YES\", meaning the pile can form both names.\n\n   Let me recount the expected letters:\n\n        Guest: SANTACLAUS -> {'S':2, 'A':2, 'N':1, 'T':1, 'C':1, 'L':1, 'U':1}\n        Host:  DEDMOROZ -> {'D':2, 'E':1, 'M':1, 'O':2, 'R':1, 'Z':1}\n\n        Total: \n          S:2, A:2, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n        Now, the pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        Breakdown of pile:\n          S:2, A:2, N:1, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n        This matches the total.\n\n   So, the method is:\n\n        s1 = first_line.strip()\n        s2 = second_line.strip()\n        s3 = third_line.strip()\n\n        total_letters = s1 + s2\n        pile_letters = s3\n\n        if sorted(total_letters) == sorted(pile_letters):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, note: the length must be the same. We can also check the length first for efficiency.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a frequency dictionary.\n\n   Since the strings are short (<=100), sorting is acceptable.\n\n   But let's consider performance: two strings of up to 100, so total_letters up to 200. Sorting 200 characters is cheap.\n\n   However, we can also do:\n\n        if len(total_letters) != len(pile_letters):\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            # then compare the sorted strings or use a Counter.\n\n   Using Counter might be more efficient in terms of code clarity, but we can use:\n\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        if Counter(total_letters) == Counter(pile_letters):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   But note: the problem says the letters are uppercase Latin letters, so no spaces or other characters.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   However, the problem says: the third line is the pile. There might be multiple words? No, the problem says: \"All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters.\"\n\n   So, we can safely use strip() to remove any trailing newline.\n\n   Example 2: \n        Input: \n            PAPAINOEL\n            JOULUPUKKI\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        Expected: NO.\n\n        Why? Because the expected total letters = \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n\n        Let me count the letters for the expected:\n            P: 2 (from PAPA) + 0 (host has none) -> but wait, host is \"JOULUPUKKI\": \n                P: 1 (in host) -> so total P: 2 (guest) + 1 (host) = 3.\n            But the pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        Actually, let me break down:\n\n        Guest: \"PAPAINOEL\" -> letters: P:2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1?\n            Actually: \n                P:2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1\n\n        Host: \"JOULUPUKKI\" -> J:1, O:1, U:2, L:1, P:1, U: already counted, K:2, I:1\n            So: \n                J:1, O:1, U:2, L:1, P:1, K:2, I:1\n\n        Total expected:\n            P: 2 (guest) + 1 (host) = 3\n            A: 2\n            I: 1 (guest) + 1 (host) = 2\n            N: 1\n            O: 1 (guest) + 1 (host) = 2\n            E: 1\n            L: 1 (guest) + 1 (host) = 2\n            J: 1\n            U: 2 (host) [guest has no U]\n            K: 2\n\n        Now, the pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        Let me count the pile:\n\n            J:1, O:2, U:3, L:2, N:1, A:2, P:2, I:2, E:1, K:2\n\n        So, the pile has:\n            J:1 -> ok\n            O:2 -> ok\n            U:3 -> but expected 2 -> so extra U\n            L:2 -> ok\n            N:1 -> ok\n            A:2 -> ok\n            P:2 -> but expected 3 -> missing one P\n            I:2 -> ok\n            E:1 -> ok\n            K:2 -> ok\n\n        So, indeed, there is an extra U and a missing P. Hence, the frequencies don't match.\n\n   Therefore, we'll use the Counter method.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n        total_counter = Counter(s1 + s2)\n        pile_counter = Counter(s3)\n\n        if total_counter == pile_counter:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   Let's test with the third sample:\n\n        Input: \n            BABBONATALE\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        Expected: NO.\n\n        Why? Because the example says there's an extra letter 'L'.\n\n        Let me compute:\n\n        Guest: \"BABBONATALE\"\n        Host: \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n\n        Combined expected string: \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n\n        Count the letters in the combined string and in the pile.\n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the pile is \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        The pile has an extra 'L' (appearing twice in the pile for the letter 'L') and maybe missing something?\n\n        But let's compare the counts:\n\n        Expected (guest and host):\n\n            B: \n                Guest: BABBONATALE -> B:2, A:2, B again? Actually: \n                    B: count in guest: 2, host: FATHERCHRISTMAS -> no B, so total B:2.\n                Pile: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER -> B: count: \n                    First two letters: 'BA' then later 'B' in CHRISTMAS? Actually, let's break it:\n\n                Guest: \"BABBONATALE\" -> letters: B, A, B, O, N, A, T, A, L, E -> so B:2, A:3, etc.\n\n            Instead, we can use the Counter.\n\n        But note: the problem says the third sample has an extra letter 'L'. \n\n        In the pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\", the substring \"ALLE\" has two L's, while the original combined string (without pile) doesn't have two L's?\n\n        Let me count L in guest and host:\n\n            Guest: \"BABBONATALE\" -> has one L at the end.\n            Host: \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\" -> no L.\n\n            So expected L:1.\n\n            In pile: two L's -> so indeed, extra L.\n\n        Therefore, the Counter for the pile will have an extra L and possibly other differences.\n\n        So the code using Counter will correctly output \"NO\".\n\n   However, note: the example input for the third sample is given as:\n\n        ['BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   We are reading three lines.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   We assume that the input is exactly three lines.\n\n   Code:\n\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n        total_str = s1 + s2\n        pile_str = s3\n\n        if Counter(total_str) == Counter(pile_str):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   Let me test with the first example:\n\n        s1 = \"SANTACLAUS\", s2 = \"DEDMOROZ\", total_str = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n        Counter(total_str) should be:\n            S:2, A:2, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n        pile_str = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        Counter(pile_str) should be the same.\n\n   This works.\n\n   But wait, the example input was:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n   Actually, the third line is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", which is 15 letters? Let me count:\n\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS: \n            S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S -> \n            S:2, A:2, N:1, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1 -> total 2+2+1+1+1+2+1+1+2+1+1+1+1 = 17? \n\n        But wait, the expected total_str is 10+8=18.\n\n        There's a discrepancy.\n\n        Let me recount the expected total_str: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n            S:2, A:2, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1 -> 2+2+1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+2+1+1 = 18.\n\n        The pile has 17? Then they cannot be equal.\n\n        But wait, the example input is given as:\n\n            ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n        The third string is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", which is 16 characters? \n\n        Let me write it out:\n\n            S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S -> \n            That's 16 characters.\n\n        How?\n\n            S(1), A(2), N(3), T(4), A(5), M(6), O(7), R(8), O(9), Z(10), D(11), E(12), D(13), C(14), L(15), A(16), U(17), S(18) -> wait, I count 18? \n\n        Actually, the string \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" has:\n\n            S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S -> 18 characters.\n\n        But wait, the example says the output is \"YES\".\n\n        Now, let me recount the expected total_str:\n\n            Guest: \"SANTACLAUS\" -> 10 letters: S,A,N,T,A,C,L,A,U,S -> that's 10.\n            Host: \"DEDMOROZ\" -> 8 letters: D,E,D,M,O,R,O,Z -> that's 8.\n\n            Total: 18.\n\n        And the pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" -> 18 letters.\n\n        Now, the breakdown:\n\n        Guest: SANTACLAUS -> \n            S:2, A:3 (because of 'A' at positions 2,5,8) -> wait, let me count again:\n\n            S:1 (first letter) and then S:1 (last letter) -> 2\n            A: at index1, index4, index7 -> 3 times?\n            Wait, let me spell: \n                S A N T A C L A U S -> \n                positions: \n                    0: S\n                    1: A\n                    2: N\n                    3: T\n                    4: A\n                    5: C\n                    6: L\n                    7: A\n                    8: U\n                    9: S\n\n            So A appears at indices 1,4,7 -> 3 times.\n\n        But then the host \"DEDMOROZ\" has no A.\n\n        Then the pile should have 3 A's. But the pile \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" has:\n\n            S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S -> \n            A's: at the second letter, then the fifth letter, then the 16th letter? \n\n            Actually, the pile: \n                S (1), A (2), N (3), T (4), A (5), M (6), O (7), R (8), O (9), Z (10), D (11), E (12), D (13), C (14), L (15), A (16), U (17), S (18)\n\n            So A at position2,5,16 -> 3 times.\n\n        Similarly, let's check S: guest has two, host has none -> total 2. Pile: first and last -> 2.\n\n        And D: guest has none, host has two -> total 2. Pile: positions 11 and 13 -> 2.\n\n        It matches.\n\n        So the example does work.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n        total_counter = Counter(s1 + s2)\n        pile_counter = Counter(s3)\n\n        if total_counter == pile_counter:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   Let's run the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: YES\n   Example 2: NO\n   Example 3: NO\n\n   We are good.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input file consists of three lines. We are reading from stdin.\n\n   We can also avoid importing Counter by using a dictionary and comparing, but since the problem is small, and Counter is clear, we use it.\n\n   But note: the problem constraints say the length is at most 100, so we are safe.\n\n   Final code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves comparing the frequency of each letter in the combined names with the frequency of letters in the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Inputs**: The first two lines are the guest's name and the host's name, respectively. The third line is the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's and host's names into a single string to form the expected letters.\n3. **Count Frequencies**: Use a counter to count the occurrences of each letter in both the combined names and the pile.\n4. **Compare Counts**: If the counts of all letters match exactly between the combined names and the pile, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    s1 = input().strip()\n    s2 = input().strip()\n    s3 = input().strip()\n    \n    total_counter = Counter(s1 + s2)\n    pile_counter = Counter(s3)\n    \n    if total_counter == pile_counter:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Inputs**: The code reads three lines from standard input, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's and host's names are concatenated into a single string (`s1 + s2`), which represents all the letters needed to form both names.\n3. **Counting Letters**: The `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to count occurrences of each letter in both the combined names and the pile. This provides a dictionary-like structure where keys are letters and values are their respective counts.\n4. **Comparison**: The code checks if the counts of letters in the combined names exactly match the counts in the pile. If they do, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\". This ensures that the pile contains exactly the required letters without any extras or missing letters. \n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the solution by leveraging the `Counter` class for accurate and quick comparison of letter frequencies.",
