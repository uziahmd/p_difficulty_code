Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given up to 100000 souvenirs, each with weight in {1,2,3} and cost up to 10^9.\n Since the weights are only 1, 2, or 3, we can group the souvenirs by weight.\n\n Let:\n   type1 = list of costs for weight 1\n   type2 = list of costs for weight 2\n   type3 = list of costs for weight 3\n\n Then the total weight is a combination of a1 (from type1), a2 (from type2), a3 (from type3) such that:\n   a1 * 1 + a2 * 2 + a3 * 3 <= m\n\n We want to maximize: (sum of selected from type1) + (sum of selected from type2) + (sum of selected from type3)\n\n However, note that we don't necessarily take all. But we have three independent groups.\n\n Idea:\n   For each type, we want to choose items (non-decreasing by cost? but note: we can sort and then use knapSack-like DP, but m can be up to 300000 and n up to 100000, so we need an efficient way.\n\n Observation: The problem is similar to the bounded knapsack problem but with very small weights (only 1,2,3). However, note that the number of items per type might be large, but the weights are small.\n\n Alternate idea:\n   Since the weights are only 1,2,3, we can consider:\n\n   Step 1: Precompute for each type the best total cost for any number of items (but note: we cannot take fractional items, and the items have different costs).\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n   For each type, we sort the costs in descending order and then form a list of the best k items for k from 1 to the count of that type? But note: we are going to combine the three types.\n\n   However, the state space is too high if we try to iterate over counts of each type.\n\n   Another classic approach for multiple items with same weight (or small weights) is to use the \"grouping\" and then use a DP that iterates over the weight and considers the three types one by one.\n\n   But note: m is up to 300000, and we have three types, but the counts per type can be up to 100000. However, the weights are only 1,2,3, so we can use a DP that goes up to m and uses the fact that the items are divisible by 1,2,3? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use a greedy-like method for each type and then combine the results by iterating over the possible number of items from each type? But that would be O(n1 * n2 * n3) which is too high.\n\n   Insight: We can precompute for each type the maximum total cost for taking exactly k items (k from 0 to the number of items in that type). Then we can use a two-dimensional DP for the two other types, but that is also too heavy.\n\n   Another idea: Since the weights are 1,2,3, we can use a DP that runs in O(m) and considers the three types separately. We can use a state dp[i][j] meaning the maximum total cost for the first i types (by grouping) and total weight j. But there are 3 types, and j goes up to 300000, so we can do:\n\n   dp[0][j] = 0 for all j.\n\n   Then for type1 (weight 1): we can do a knapSack for each item, but since we have many items, we can do:\n\n   However, we can precompute the best total cost for a given weight from type1, type2, type3 independently. But note: we have to combine them.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a DP that goes from low weight to high weight and update the best cost for a given weight.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Group the items by weight.\n\n   2. Sort each group by cost in descending order.\n\n   3. For each group, we can compute an array best[k] = maximum total cost we can get by taking k items from that group. This is done by taking the top k items.\n\n   But note: we don't have to take contiguous top k? Actually, because we are allowed to take any subset, and the items are independent, the best k items from the group (by descending cost) will give the maximum total cost for k items.\n\n   So for type1 (weight1): \n        Let arr1 = sorted(type1, reverse=True)\n        Then for k from 1 to len(arr1): best1[k] = best1[k-1] + arr1[k-1]\n\n   Similarly for type2 and type3.\n\n   Now, we wish to choose non-negative integers a, b, c (number of items from type1, type2, type3) such that:\n        a*1 + b*2 + c*3 <= m\n        and the total cost = best1[a] + best2[b] + best3[c] is maximized.\n\n   How to combine? We can iterate over one variable and then use the other two. But note: the maximum a is at most the total count of type1, which could be up to 100000, and similarly for others. We cannot iterate over all possibilities.\n\n   But note: the total weight is fixed and the weight per item is small. We can iterate over the number of type3 (c) and then for the remaining weight (m - 3*c) we consider type1 and type2.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute for type1 and type2 together as a combined group with items of weight 1 and 2.\n\n   However, note: we can use a knapSack style for the combined type1 and type2? But the combined group has two types: weight1 and weight2, and we have two separate arrays for the best k items for each.\n\n   Let F(w) be the maximum total cost we can get from type1 and type2 with total weight <= w.\n\n   How to compute F(w)? We can use a two-dimensional knapSack but the total weight w can be up to 300000. But note: the items are of weight 1 and 2, and we have two independent sets.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   Let g(x) = maximum total cost from type1 for weight x (which is just the sum of the top x items from type1, but x can be from 0 to n1, and the weight used is x).\n   Similarly, h(y) for type2: but for type2, the weight is 2 per item, so if we take y items, the weight is 2*y.\n\n   Then for a given total weight w, we can use:\n\n        for x from 0 to n1:\n            y can be from 0 to min(n2, w//2 - x)   [because the weight from type1 is x, and from type2 is 2*y, and total weight x+2*y<=w]\n            total_cost = best1[x] + best2[y]\n\n   But this is too slow.\n\n   Instead, we can precompute an array for the combined type1 and type2:\n\n        Let dp[w] = maximum total cost from type1 and type2 for weight <= w.\n\n        We can do:\n\n        Step 1: Precompute an array for type1: for weight i (i from 0 to n1), we know the total cost for i items (best1[i]).\n        Similarly for type2: for j items, weight 2*j, total cost best2[j].\n\n        But note: we are allowed to mix arbitrarily. We can do:\n\n        Option 1: Use a knapSack that allows two different item types (with weight 1 and 2) and we have unlimited supply? Actually, we have a fixed set of items (each type has a fixed set, but we can take any subset). \n\n        However, the two types are independent and we have computed the best k items for each.\n\n        We can combine by:\n\n            Let A = [0] + best1[1:]   # for weight i (which is i) from type1, but note: we can only take contiguous top ones? Actually, we can take any subset, but our best1[k] is the sum of the top k, so that is the maximum for k items.\n\n        Then we can do:\n\n            dp_combined[0] = 0\n            For weight from 1 to m:\n                dp_combined[weight] = max( dp_combined[weight], dp_combined[weight-1] )   # not taking a weight1 item\n                if weight>=1: dp_combined[weight] = max(dp_combined[weight], dp_combined[weight-1] + best1_item? ) -> but wait, we have precomputed best1 for each count.\n\n        But note: we have the entire set of type1 and type2. We can do:\n\n            First, we can consider type1: then we can use the fact that type1 items are of weight1 and we can take any number. But we have limited items (the top ones). \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n            Let's create an array for the combined group (type1 and type2) for weights from 0 to m.\n\n            We'll do:\n\n                Let f[i] = maximum total cost for weight i from type1 and type2.\n\n            How to build f?\n                We can iterate over the items in type1 and type2? But we have two independent sets.\n\n            Since the items are independent, we can use:\n\n                f[i] = max_{k} { best1[k] + best2[j] } such that k + 2*j <= i.\n\n            But note: the weight from type1 is k (since each type1 item is weight1) and from type2 is 2*j.\n\n            Then we can iterate over j (number of type2 items) and then k can be from 0 to i - 2*j.\n\n            But then we are iterating over j and then k, and i goes up to 300000, and j goes up to 150000 (if i=300000) and k goes up to 100000, which is too heavy.\n\n        Another idea: Precompute an array for type1: let A[i] = best total cost for type1 with total weight i (so i is the number of type1 items, and i from 0 to n1). Similarly, for type2, we can have B[i] = best total cost for type2 with total weight 2*i (for i from 0 to n2). Then for a given weight w, we want:\n\n            max_{i+j*2 <= w} { A[i] + B[j] }\n\n        We can fix j (the number of type2 items) and then the remaining weight for type1 is w' = w - 2*j, and then we take A[min(n1, w')] but note: we want the maximum for any i <= w'. However, our A is defined for i from 0 to n1, and we assume A[i] is increasing (since we are taking the best items, so more items give higher or equal cost). Similarly, B is increasing.\n\n        Then we can do:\n\n            Let F(w) = max_{i=0}^{min(n1, w)} A[i]   for a fixed w (this is the best we can get from type1 with weight <= w)\n\n            Then F_combined(w) = max_{j=0}^{floor(w/2)} { F(w - 2*j) + B[j] }\n\n        But note: we must be careful because j must be an integer and we require that the total weight is i + 2*j <= w, and we are using F(w-2*j) which is the best type1 we can get for weight w-2*j.\n\n        However, we can precompute F(w) for all w from 0 to m? But m can be up to 300000, and then for each j we do:\n\n            F_combined(w) = max_{j: 2*j <= w} { F(w-2*j) + B[j] }\n\n        Then we want to compute F_combined(w) for all w from 0 to m.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Step 1: Precompute A for type1: \n                Let n1 = len(type1)\n                Sort type1 in descending order.\n                A = [0]*(n1+1)\n                for i in range(1, n1+1):\n                    A[i] = A[i-1] + type1_sorted[i-1]\n\n                Then F(w) for a given w is: \n                    i_max = min(n1, w)   [since each type1 item is weight1, so maximum i is w (if w<=n1) or n1 if w>n1]\n                    Then F(w) = A[i_max]   ??? But wait: we are allowed to take any subset, and the best i_max items (which are the top i_max) is the maximum. However, note: we don't have to take contiguous? Actually, yes: because the items are independent and we can only take a subset, and the best total is achieved by taking the top i_max items.\n\n            However, wait: is it always optimal to take the top i_max items? Yes, because each item has a positive cost and we are maximizing the sum.\n\n            But note: we are forced to use contiguous top? Actually, we are taking the best i_max items, so that gives the maximum sum for i_max items. And we are allowed to take fewer. So for a given weight limit w for type1, we can take at most w items (if w<=n1) or n1 items (if w>n1). And the best is to take the top min(w, n1) items.\n\n            BUT: wait, is that correct? Consider: we have two items of type1: [10, 1]. Then for weight=1, we can take either the 10 or the 1. But the top 1 is 10, so that is better. However, if we have [10, 1, 5] and weight=2, then the best is 10+5=15, which is the top 2 items. So yes, we can just take the top k items.\n\n            However, note: the weight for type1 is the count (each item weight=1). So for type1, the maximum number of items we can take is the minimum between the weight limit and the total available.\n\n            Step 2: Precompute B for type2:\n                Let n2 = len(type2)\n                Sort type2 in descending order.\n                B = [0]*(n2+1)\n                for i in range(1, n2+1):\n                    B[i] = B[i-1] + type2_sorted[i-1]\n\n            Step 3: Precompute F(w) for all w from 0 to m (for type1 only, with weight limit w):\n\n                We note that for type1, the maximum number of items we can take is min(w, n1). So:\n\n                F(w) = A[min(w, n1)]\n\n            But wait: is that correct? Actually, we are allowed to take fewer than w items? But note: if we take fewer, say k < min(w, n1), then the cost is A[k] which is less than A[min(w, n1)] (if we are adding positive numbers). However, we are not forced to take the maximum number of items. But the function A is increasing (because we are adding positive numbers). Therefore, the maximum for type1 with weight <= w is indeed A[min(w, n1)].\n\n            Step 4: Now, we want to compute G(w) = maximum total cost from type1 and type2 for weight <= w.\n\n                We can use: \n                    G(w) = max_{j from 0 to min(n2, w//2)} { F(w - 2*j) + B[j] }\n\n                But note: we cannot exceed the available items. However, note that F(w - 2*j) already takes into account the limit of type1 (so if w-2*j >= n1, then we take all type1; if less, then the top (w-2*j) items). And B[j] is defined for j from 0 to n2.\n\n            However, we must ensure that j does not exceed n2 and w-2*j >=0.\n\n            But note: we are iterating j from 0 to min(n2, w//2). Then we compute F(w-2*j) which is defined for w-2*j from 0 to m (we have built F for all w from 0 to m).\n\n            But now, how to compute G(w) for all w from 0 to m? \n\n                We can do:\n\n                Let G = [0]*(m+1)\n\n                For w from 0 to m:\n                    # We consider all j such that 2*j <= w and j<=n2\n                    # But then we have to look at j from 0 to min(n2, w//2) and take the maximum of F(w-2*j)+B[j]\n\n                However, this is O(m * (number of j)) which is too slow because for each w, the inner loop runs about w//2 times, and w goes up to 300000, so the total operations would be O(m^2) which is 90e9, too slow.\n\n            We need to optimize. Notice that the expression is:\n\n                G(w) = max_{j=0}^{min(n2, floor(w/2))} { F(w-2*j) + B[j] }\n\n            We can change variable: let j be the number of type2 items, and then the weight allocated to type2 is 2*j, and the remaining weight w' = w - 2*j is allocated to type1.\n\n            Alternatively, we can iterate by type2 and update the G array. Since type2 items are of weight 2, we can do:\n\n                Start with an array T = [0]*(m+1)   # T is the base for type1: T[w] = F(w) (from type1 alone for weight w)\n\n                Then, we want to consider adding type2 items (each type2 item adds 2 to the weight and adds B[1], then B[2] for two items, etc.)\n\n                But note: we have precomputed B for the entire type2 set (the best j items). So we can do:\n\n                We'll do a knapSack for type2 and then combine with T.\n\n                Actually, we can do:\n\n                    G(w) = max_{j=0}^{min(n2, w//2)} { T[w - 2*j] + B[j] }\n\n                Now, we can precompute an array H for the combined type1 and type2 by:\n\n                    Let H(w) = max_{j=0}^{min(n2, w//2)} { T[w - 2*j] + B[j] }\n\n                But note: we have T defined for all w from 0 to m.\n\n                We can iterate j from 0 to n2, and for each j, we update for all w from 2*j to m:\n\n                    candidate = T[w - 2*j] + B[j]\n\n                    Then H(w) = max(H(w), candidate)\n\n                But the inner loop for w from 2*j to m is O(m) and j goes up to n2, so total O(m*n2) which is too heavy (n2 can be 100000, m=300000 -> 30e9 * 100000 operations).\n\n            Alternative: we can use the fact that T is non-decreasing in w (because as weight increases, we can take more type1 items, and the cost is increasing). Therefore, for a fixed j, the candidate value for a given w is:\n\n                candidate_j(w) = T[w - 2*j] + B[j]\n\n            And note that T is non-decreasing, so candidate_j(w) is non-decreasing in w (because w-2*j increases, and T increases). \n\n            Then, for each j, we can update the array H by doing:\n\n                Let w0 = 2*j\n                For w from w0 to m:\n                    candidate = T[w - w0] + B[j]\n                    Then H(w) = max(H(w), candidate)\n\n            But again, we are iterating j from 0 to n2 and for each j we iterate from w0 to m, which is O(m) per j, and total O(n2*m) which is too slow.\n\n            Another idea: use a sliding window or use convolution? \n\n            Note: the update for a fixed j is a shift of T by 2*j to the right and adding a constant B[j]. Then we take the maximum over j.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                H(w) = max_{j} { T(w - 2*j) + B[j] } for j such that 2*j <= w.\n\n            This is a standard convolution-like problem, but note the step in j is 1 and the shift is 2*j (even numbers). \n\n            We can precompute an array Q for even indices and odd indices? But note: w goes from 0 to m.\n\n            Alternatively, we can iterate by j and update H in a smarter way. Since T is non-decreasing, the candidate_j(w) is increasing in w. Therefore, for each j, the maximum candidate_j(w) for w>=2*j is achieved at the largest w? Not exactly: we are combining with the type1 part which is fixed for a given w-2*j.\n\n            However, we are allowed to use any w. We want the maximum over j and w.\n\n            Another idea: iterate w from 0 to m, and for each w, we want to consider j from 0 to min(n2, w//2). But we need to quickly get the maximum of { T[w-2*j] + B[j] } for j from 0 to min(n2, w//2).\n\n            Let j vary, then w-2*j = w, w-2, w-4, ... until >=0.\n\n            We can precompute an array M where M[i] = max_{j} { T[i - 2*j] + B[j] } for i from 0 to m, but j is bounded by min(n2, i//2). \n\n            How about: for a fixed i (which is the remaining weight for type1), we want to consider j from 0 to min(n2, i//2) and take the maximum of B[j] + T[i-2*j]. \n\n            Then, we can do:\n\n                Let H(i) = max_{j=0}^{min(n2, i//2)} { B[j] + T[i-2*j] }\n\n            Then our answer for total weight w is max_{i=0}^{w} H(i) ?\n\n            Actually, no: we want for total weight w: the maximum over j (type2 items) and then the type1 part gets the remaining weight w-2*j. So:\n\n                G(w) = max_{j=0}^{min(n2, w//2)} { T[w-2*j] + B[j] } = max_{i=0}^{w} { T[i] + B[(w-i)//2] }   but note: i must be even? Not exactly: i = w - 2*j, so i and w have the same parity.\n\n            Actually, we can do:\n\n                For a fixed w, i = w - 2*j, so i must have the same parity as w and i<=w and i>=0 and j<=n2.\n\n            But note: we don't need to consider every w for H(i) separately. \n\n            Alternatively, we can precompute an array R for the entire range [0, m] (for the combined type1 and type2) by:\n\n                Let R[i] = max_{j=0}^{min(n2, i//2)} { T[i - 2*j] + B[j] }   for i from 0 to m.\n\n            Then G(w) = R[w] (but note: R[w] is defined for the entire weight w, but we are allowed to use less than w? Actually, no: we are using exactly w? But note: we are allowed to use less than w. However, the definition of T and B is for the entire set, and we are taking the best we can for the given weight.\n\n            But wait: our T[i] is defined as the maximum total cost for type1 with weight <= i. However, in the above definition for R, we are using exactly i for type1 and then j for type2 (so total weight i+2*j). But then R[i] is defined for i being the weight allocated to type1, and then we are using j = (i+2*j) ??? \n\n            Let me redefine: \n\n                We want to compute for each total weight w (from 0 to m) the maximum cost from type1 and type2.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    Let R[i] = maximum total cost from type1 and type2 when the total weight is i.\n\n                Then R[i] = max_{j=0}^{min(n2, i//2)} { T[i - 2*j] + B[j] }\n\n                But note: T[i - 2*j] is the maximum cost for type1 with weight <= i-2*j, and B[j] is the maximum cost for type2 with j items (which uses 2*j weight). However, wait: T[i-2*j] is defined for the entire type1 set (we can take any subset of type1 with total weight <= i-2*j). But we are not constrained to use exactly i-2*j for type1? Actually, we are: because we want to use exactly i (the total weight) and the type2 uses 2*j, so type1 uses i-2*j.\n\n                But our T was defined as the best for weight <= i-2*j. However, we are allowed to use less than i-2*j for type1? Then we should use the best for type1 with weight <= i-2*j, which is T[i-2*j] (which is the best we can do for type1 with weight <= i-2*j). But note: we are using exactly i-2*j for type1? No, we are not forced to use the entire i-2*j for type1. However, if we don't use the entire i-2*j, then we are wasting weight. But since T[i-2*j] is the best we can do for type1 with weight <= i-2*j, then that is the maximum.\n\n            However, note: T[i] is defined as the best total cost for type1 with weight <= i. So if we have a weight limit i-2*j, then T[i-2*j] is the best we can do for type1.\n\n            Then, the total weight used is i (from type1: at most i-2*j, and type2: 2*j) but wait, the total weight is (type1_weight) + 2*j. But we are fixing the total weight to i, so we must have type1_weight + 2*j = i. However, we are allowed to use less than i? \n\n            Actually, the problem allows any subset with total weight <= m. So we don't need to use exactly i, but we want the maximum for any weight <= i. But then our R[i] as defined above (for exactly i) is not the same as the maximum for <= i.\n\n            We want: for each total weight limit i, the maximum cost from type1 and type2 is the maximum over all ways to split i into type1 and type2. But we can also use less than i.\n\n            However, note: the maximum for weight <= i is the maximum of R[j] for j from 0 to i. But then we would have to compute R for all j from 0 to i, and then take the maximum. But we want to avoid that.\n\n            Let me reframe: we want to compute an array G for weight from 0 to m, where:\n\n                G[i] = maximum total cost from type1 and type2 with total weight <= i.\n\n            How to compute G[i]? \n\n                We can use the fact that the best way is to use some j (number of type2 items) and then the rest (i - 2*j) for type1, but we are allowed to not use the entire i.\n\n                Actually, we can do:\n\n                    G[i] = max_{j=0}^{min(n2, i//2)} { T[i - 2*j] + B[j] }   [if we use exactly i-2*j for type1 and 2*j for type2, and we are not allowed to exceed i]\n\n                But wait, we are allowed to use less than i. However, if we use less than i, then we can always use the entire i without decreasing the cost (because T and B are increasing in their respective counts). Therefore, the maximum for <= i is the maximum for exactly j (for j from 0 to i) but we are only considering splits that exactly use i? \n\n                Actually, no: we are allowed to leave out some weight. But if we leave out weight, we might get a higher cost? Not necessarily: because we are taking the best items. But note: T[i] is defined as the best for type1 with weight <= i, so if we have a weight limit i, we can use at most i. However, if we use less, we might be missing some items. But our T[i] is the best for <= i, so we are already accounting for the possibility of not using the entire i.\n\n                Therefore, we can define:\n\n                    Let R[i] = max_{j=0}^{min(n2, i//2)} { T[i - 2*j] + B[j] }\n\n                Then, the maximum for weight <= i is the maximum of R[k] for k from 0 to i.\n\n                But note: we want to compute G[i] = max_{k=0}^{i} R[k]\n\n            However, we can compute R[i] for all i from 0 to m, and then do a suffix maximum (or prefix maximum) for the entire array.\n\n            Steps for combined type1 and type2:\n\n                Precomputation:\n                    T[0..m] = [0]*(m+1)\n                    Let n1 = len(type1)\n                    Sort type1 in descending order.\n                    A = [0]*(n1+1)\n                    for i in range(1, n1+1):\n                        A[i] = A[i-1] + type1_sorted[i-1]\n                    Then for w from 0 to m:\n                        T[w] = A[min(w, n1)]\n\n                    Similarly for type2, we have B[0..n2] (for j items, j from 0 to n2) and then we define an array for type2 by weight: \n                        Let W2 = [0]*(n2+1)   # W2[j] = 2*j (the weight for j items)\n                        But we don't need to store W2 separately.\n\n                    Then, we want to compute R[i] for i from 0 to m:\n\n                        R[i] = 0\n                        j_min = 0\n                        j_max = min(n2, i//2)\n                        Then for j from j_min to j_max:\n                            candidate = T[i - 2*j] + B[j]\n                            R[i] = max(R[i], candidate)\n\n                    But this is O(i) for each i, and i goes up to m, so total O(m^2) which is too slow.\n\n            We need to optimize the computation of R[i]. \n\n            Notice: j goes from 0 to floor(i/2). We can iterate j and update a range of i. But the update is additive and we are taking the maximum.\n\n            Alternatively, we can iterate j from 0 to n2, and for each j, update the array R for i from 2*j to m:\n\n                R[i] = max(R[i], T[i - 2*j] + B[j])\n\n            Then, we do:\n\n                R = [0]*(m+1)\n                for j in range(0, n2+1):\n                    start = 2*j\n                    if start > m:\n                        break\n                    for i in range(start, m+1):\n                        candidate = T[i - start] + B[j]\n                        if candidate > R[i]:\n                            R[i] = candidate\n\n            Then, after that, we do:\n\n                G = [0]*(m+1)\n                # Now, G[i] = max_{k=0}^{i} R[k]\n                current_max = 0\n                for i in range(0, m+1):\n                    if R[i] > current_max:\n                        current_max = R[i]\n                    G[i] = current_max\n\n            But the inner loop is from start to m, and j goes up to n2 (which is 100000) and m=300000, so the total operations is sum_{j=0}^{n2} (m - 2*j + 1). This is approximately (n2+1)*m - 2*(0+1+...+n2) which is O(n2*m) ~ 100000 * 300000 = 30e9, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python might be borderline (but note: worst-case n2 can be 100000, and m=300000, so the total iterations would be about 30e9, which is too many in Python).\n\n            We need to optimize further.\n\n            We can use a smarter update: for a fixed j, we are updating:\n\n                R[i] = max(R[i], T[i - 2*j] + B[j]) for i from 2*j to m.\n\n            But note: T[i - 2*j] is a function of i-2*j, and we are shifting by 2*j. And T is non-decreasing. So the sequence of candidate values for j is:\n\n                candidate_i = T[i - 2*j] + B[j]\n\n            And T is non-decreasing, so candidate_i is non-decreasing in i (because i-2*j increases).\n\n            Then, for a fixed j, the update is: for i from 2*j to m, we set R[i] = max(R[i], candidate_i). And since candidate_i is non-decreasing, we can update from left to right and once we see a candidate_i that is greater than the previous, we can mark that from this point onward, the candidate_i is increasing. But note: we are doing multiple j's.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use a deque to do a sliding window maximum? But here we are updating for each j separately.\n\n            Another idea: we can iterate i from 0 to m, and for each i, consider j from 0 to floor(i/2). But then we need to quickly get the maximum of { T[i-2*j] + B[j] } for j in [0, floor(i/2)].\n\n            Let j vary, then we can precompute an array S where S[i] = maximum over j such that 2*j <= i of { B[j] + T[i-2*j] }.\n\n            Notice that i-2*j runs over even numbers? Not necessarily: i and 2*j have the same parity? Actually, i-2*j is i minus an even number, so it has the same parity as i.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                Let i run from 0 to m, and for each i, we want to consider j from 0 to min(n2, i//2). But note: j = (i - (i-2*j)) / 2, and i-2*j must be in the range [0, m] and also must be a valid index for T.\n\n            We can precompute an array Q for all indices from 0 to m, and then for each i, we consider the values at indices i, i-2, i-4, ... until 0.\n\n            But then we need to know the maximum of { B[j] + T[i-2*j] } for j from 0 to min(n2, i//2). We can store for each index k (which is i-2*j) the corresponding B[j] = B[(i-k)//2]. But k must be i-2*j, so j=(i-k)/2.\n\n            Then, for fixed i, we are looking at k = i, i-2, i-4, ... and we want to know the maximum of { B[(i-k)//2] + T[k] } for k from 0 to i and k>=i-2*(min(n2, i//2)) and k<=i.\n\n            But note: we have to ensure that (i-k) is even and nonnegative, and j=(i-k)/2 <= n2.\n\n            Then, we can do:\n\n                R[i] = 0\n                k = i\n                while k>=0:\n                    j_val = (i - k) // 2\n                    if j_val > n2:\n                        k -= 2\n                        continue\n                    candidate = T[k] + B[j_val]\n                    R[i] = max(R[i], candidate)\n                    k -= 2\n\n            Then, the total operations is O(m * (number of steps)) and the number of steps for each i is i//2",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market without exceeding a given weight limit. The souvenirs have weights of either 1, 2, or 3, and each has a specific cost. The challenge is to select a subset of these souvenirs such that their combined weight is within the limit and their total cost is maximized.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Grouping by Weight**: First, we group the souvenirs by their weights (1, 2, or 3). This allows us to handle each weight category separately.\n2. **Sorting and Prefix Sums**: For each weight category, we sort the souvenirs in descending order of their costs. Then, we compute prefix sums for these sorted lists. This helps in quickly determining the maximum cost achievable by selecting the top `k` items in any category.\n3. **Dynamic Programming for Combined Weights**: We use dynamic programming to compute the maximum cost achievable for combining items from different weight categories. Specifically:\n   - **Type1 (weight 1)**: We compute an array `T` where `T[w]` is the maximum cost achievable with weight `w` using only items of weight 1.\n   - **Type2 and Type3 (weights 2 and 3)**: We similarly compute arrays for these categories but combine them with the results from Type1 to find the optimal solution for the entire problem.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    it = iter(data)\n    n = int(next(it))\n    m = int(next(it))\n    \n    type1 = []\n    type2 = []\n    type3 = []\n    \n    for _ in range(n):\n        w = int(next(it))\n        c = int(next(it))\n        if w == 1:\n            type1.append(c)\n        elif w == 2:\n            type2.append(c)\n        else:\n            type3.append(c)\n            \n    def compute_prefix(arr):\n        arr.sort(reverse=True)\n        n_arr = len(arr)\n        prefix = [0]*(n_arr+1)\n        for i in range(1, n_arr+1):\n            prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + arr[i-1]\n        return prefix\n        \n    A = compute_prefix(type1)\n    B = compute_prefix(type2)\n    C = compute_prefix(type3)\n    \n    n1 = len(type1)\n    n2 = len(type2)\n    n3 = len(type3)\n    \n    T = [0]*(m+1)\n    max_items1 = min(n1, m)\n    for w in range(1, m+1):\n        num_items = min(w, n1)\n        T[w] = A[min(w, n1)]\n        \n    H = [0]*(m+1)\n    for j in range(0, min(n2, m//2)+1):\n        start_weight = 2*j\n        if start_weight > m:\n            break\n        for w_total in range(start_weight, m+1):\n            remaining_weight = w_total - start_weight\n            candidate = T[remaining_weight] + B[j]\n            if candidate > H[w_total]:\n                H[w_total] = candidate\n                \n    best_so_far = 0\n    ans_combined = [0]*(m+1)\n    for w in range(0, m+1):\n        if H[w] > best_so_far:\n            best_so_far = H[w]\n        ans_combined[w] = best_so_far\n        \n    total_max = 0\n    for c in range(0, min(n3, m//3)+1):\n        weight3 = 3*c\n        if weight3 > m:\n            break\n        remaining_weight = m - weight3\n        candidate = ans_combined[remaining_weight] + C[c]\n        if candidate > total_max:\n            total_max = candidate\n            \n    print(total_max)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed into three lists based on the weight of the souvenirs (1, 2, or 3).\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: Each list is sorted in descending order of cost, and prefix sums are computed to quickly access the sum of the top `k` items.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Arrays**:\n   - **Array `T`**: For each possible weight up to `m`, `T[w]` stores the maximum cost achievable using only items of weight 1.\n   - **Array `H`**: Combines the results from items of weight 1 and 2. For each possible number of weight 2 items, it calculates the maximum cost achievable when combined with weight 1 items.\n4. **Final Calculation**: The maximum cost is determined by considering all combinations of items from all three weight categories, ensuring the total weight does not exceed `m`.
