Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, and then n lines of n characters each.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. All the letters on both diagonals must be the same (but note: the center is shared by both diagonals).\n 2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must be the same letter and different from the diagonal letter.\n\n However, note that the example: \n   Input: 3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw -> Output: YES\n   But: \n        w s w\n        s w s\n        w s w\n\n Here, the diagonals have 'w' (from top-left to bottom-right: w, w, w; and the other diagonal: w, w, w) and the non-diagonal are all 's'. \n\n Steps:\n 1. Read n.\n 2. Read the grid.\n\n Let's define:\n   Let `center_letter` be the letter that should be on the diagonals (which will be the same throughout the diagonals).\n   Let `other_letter` be the letter that should be in every non-diagonal cell.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from the diagonal ones.\n\n Approach:\n  - Traverse the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left). \n    In fact, we can note that the condition requires that the entire diagonal (both) has the same letter, say `d`.\n  - Then, check that every cell not on either diagonal is the same letter, say `x`, and that `x != d`.\n\n But note: what if the grid is such that the diagonals are one letter and the rest are another? \n Example: \n      3x3: \n          a b c\n          d e f\n          g h i\n\n      Diagonals: a, e, i and c, e, g -> so the diagonals must be [a, e, i] and [c, e, g] and they must be the same letter, say 'X'.\n      Then the rest: b, d, f, h must be the same and different from 'X'.\n\n However, note that the example input provided:\n\n      Example 1: \n          5\n          xooox\n          oxoxo\n          soxoo\n          oxoxo\n          xooox\n\n      This outputs \"NO\". Why?\n          The diagonals: \n            Main: ['x','o','s','o','x'] -> but wait, the center is 's', so the diagonals must be the same letter. \n            Actually, the example has:\n                Row0: 'x','o','o','o','x'\n                Row1: 'o','x','o','x','o'\n                Row2: 's','o','x','o','s'   -> wait, the example row2 is \"soxoo\", but note the example input string is \"soxoo\", so the third row is index2: \n                    positions: \n                        0: 's'\n                        1: 'o'\n                        2: 'x'\n                        3: 'o'\n                        4: 'o'\n\n            The main diagonal: \n                row0[0] = 'x'\n                row1[1] = 'x'\n                row2[2] = 'x'\n                row3[3] = 'x'\n                row4[4] = 'x'   -> so the main diagonal is all 'x'\n\n            The anti-diagonal:\n                row0[4] = 'x'\n                row1[3] = 'x'\n                row2[2] = 'x'   -> already we have the center, then row3[1]='x', row4[0]='x'? \n                But wait: the anti-diagonal indices: \n                    (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0)\n                So: \n                    row0[4] = 'x'\n                    row1[3] = 'x' (from the second row: \"oxoxo\" -> index3 is 'x')\n                    row2[2] = 'x' (from \"soxoo\": index2 is 'x')\n                    row3[1] = 'x' (from \"oxoxo\": index1 is 'x')\n                    row4[0] = 'x' (from \"xooox\": index0 is 'x')\n\n            So both diagonals are 'x'. \n\n            Now, check non-diagonal: \n                The non-diagonal cells must be the same letter and different from 'x'. \n                But look at the center: it's included in both diagonals so we skip it. \n\n            However, the example output is \"NO\". \n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given grid of letters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: First, read the integer `n` which specifies the size of the grid. Then, read the next `n` lines to get the grid itself.\n2. **Check Diagonals**: Traverse both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left). Ensure all letters on these diagonals are the same.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Letters**: Verify that all letters not on either diagonal are the same and different from the diagonal letters.\n4. **Output Result**: If both conditions are satisfied, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = input().strip()\n        grid.append(line)\n    \n    diag_letter = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        row = grid[i]\n        col_index = i\n        letter = row[col_index]\n        if diag_letter is None:\n            diag_letter = letter\n        else:\n            if letter != diag_letter:\n                diag_letter = None\n                break\n    \n    if diag_letter is None:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        row = grid[i]\n        col_index = n - 1 - i\n        letter = row[col_index]\n        if diag_letter is None:  # This part is redundant but kept for clarity\n            diag_letter = letter\n        else:\n            if letter != diag_letter:\n                diag_letter = None\n                break\n\n    if diag_letter is None:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    other_letter = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            if other_letter is None:\n                other_letter = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != other_letter:\n                    other_letter = None\n                    break\n        if other_letter is None:\n            break\n\n    if other_letter is None:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if other_letter == diag_letter:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the size of the grid `n` and then reads each line of the grid into a list of strings.\n2. **Checking Diagonals**: The code checks the main diagonal by iterating over each cell where the row index equals the column index. Similarly, it checks the anti-diagonal by iterating over cells where the row index plus the column index equals `n-1`. If any cell in these diagonals does not match the first encountered letter, the condition fails.\n3. **Checking Non-Diagonal Letters**: After confirming all diagonal letters are the same, the code checks all other cells. These cells must all contain the same letter, which should differ from the diagonal letter.\n4. **Result Determination**: If both conditions are met, the output is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\". The solution efficiently handles edge cases, such as grids that do not meet the diagonal or non-diagonal conditions.",
