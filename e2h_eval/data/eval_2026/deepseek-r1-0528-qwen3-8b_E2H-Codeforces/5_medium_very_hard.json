Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two strings `l` and `r` of length n (n up to 150000). Each string contains lowercase Latin letters or '?'. We need to form as many pairs as possible (each boot in at most one pair) such that:\n   - A specific color must match exactly.\n   - '?' can match any color.\n\n However, note: the problem also requires printing the maximum number of pairs and then the pairs (with indices).\n\n Approach:\n\n We cannot try all possibilities because n is up to 150000. But note that the colors are only lowercase letters (26) and '?'.\n\n Idea:\n\n We can consider two parts:\n   1. Matching fixed colors (non '?') with each other and with '?' if applicable.\n   2. But note: we can use a '?' to match either a fixed color or another '?'.\n\n However, the problem is similar to bipartite matching but with wildcards. But note: we have two sets: left boots and right boots.\n\n But note: the problem asks for maximum pairs. Since we have n left and n right, maximum pairs is at most n.\n\n However, we are allowed to use '?' in both sides. We can think:\n\n   Let's denote:\n     L = list of left boots (with index and color)\n     R = list of right boots (with index and color)\n\n Steps:\n\n   Step 1: We can first try to match the non '?' boots with non '?' boots and then the rest? But wait, sometimes using a '?' to match a fixed color might leave more possibilities?\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n   We want to maximize the number of pairs. We can use greedy matching with two phases:\n\n   However, note: the problem is about maximum bipartite matching with wildcards. But the constraints are high (n=150000) so we need an efficient algorithm.\n\n   Alternatively, we can break the problem:\n\n   Consider that a '?' in left can match any color in the right (if we don't use it for a '?' on the right) and vice versa.\n\n   But note: the matching must be one-to-one.\n\n   We can try:\n\n   Let's define:\n     Let L_fixed = [ (index, color) for index, color in enumerate(l) if color != '?']\n     Let L_wild = [index for index, color in enumerate(l) if color == '?']\n\n     Similarly, R_fixed = [ (index, color) for index, color in enumerate(r) if color != '?']\n     R_wild = [index for index, color in enumerate(r) if color == '?']\n\n   Then, we can match:\n\n     1. Fixed vs fixed: for each color c, we can match left fixed boots of color c with right fixed boots of color c, but we have to choose without conflict.\n\n     2. Fixed vs wild: we can match a fixed left boot of color c with any wild right boot (because the wild right boot can be set to c). Similarly, a fixed right boot of color c can be matched with any wild left boot.\n\n     3. Wild vs wild: we can match two wild boots arbitrarily, but note that we are limited by the total number of wild boots.\n\n   However, we must maximize the total pairs. The challenge is that we cannot use the same boot twice.\n\n   Alternate approach:\n\n   We can use a greedy strategy:\n\n   Step 1: Match fixed boots with fixed boots (for the same color). But we can only match if they are the same color.\n\n        For each color c (from 'a' to 'z'):\n            count_left = number of fixed left boots with color c\n            count_right = number of fixed right boots with color c\n\n            We can match min(count_left, count_right) for color c.\n\n        But wait: what if we have a fixed left 'a' and fixed right 'a'? Then we match them.\n\n   Step 2: Now, we have some remaining fixed boots and a bunch of wild boots.\n\n        The remaining fixed boots: \n            For each color, the leftover fixed boots (left_side_rem[c] = max(0, count_left - min(count_left, count_right)) for left, similarly for right) but note: we did not necessarily assign the fixed matches per color independently because we might have multiple colors.\n\n        However, we can also consider:\n\n        We can match the remaining fixed boots with wild boots. But note: a wild boot can take any color. So:\n\n            For left fixed boots that are left: they can be matched with any wild right boot (if we don't use the wild right boot for matching a fixed right boot).\n            Similarly, for right fixed boots that are left: they can be matched with any wild left boot.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to use a wild boot only once.\n\n        Let:\n            Let L_fixed_remaining = total fixed left boots minus the ones we matched with fixed right boots.\n            Similarly, R_fixed_remaining = total fixed right boots minus the ones we matched with fixed left boots.\n\n        Then, we can use the wild boots to cover the remaining fixed boots, but we have to consider that we can also match two wild boots together.\n\n        Actually, the total pairs we can form from fixed boots is the sum over colors of min(count_left(c), count_right(c)). Then, the remaining fixed boots (both left and right) must be matched with wild boots.\n\n        Let:\n            total_fixed_pairs = T (from step 1)\n\n        Then, the remaining fixed left boots: n_fixed_left - T_left_used (but actually, we used for each color c: min(L_fixed(c), R_fixed(c)) for matching fixed with fixed). Then the remaining fixed left boots are for each color c: L_fixed(c) - min(L_fixed(c), R_fixed(c)), and similarly for right.\n\n        Then, we can use wild boots to match these remaining fixed boots. But note: we have two kinds of wild boots: left and right.\n\n        Let:\n            L_wild_count = len(L_wild)\n            R_wild_count = len(R_wild)\n\n        Now, let:\n            remaining_fixed_left = {c: L_fixed(c) - min(L_fixed(c), R_fixed(c))} for each color c, and also we can consider the total: total_remaining_left_fixed = (total left fixed) - T\n            Similarly, total_remaining_right_fixed = (total right fixed) - T\n\n        But wait, T is the total fixed pairs, so T = sum_{c} min(L_fixed(c), R_fixed(c))\n\n        Then, the remaining fixed boots (left) must be matched with wild right boots, and the remaining fixed boots (right) must be matched with wild left boots.\n\n        However, we can also match two wild boots together. The maximum pairs we can form is at most n (the total number of boots per leg) but we are trying to maximize.\n\n        Let x = number of pairs formed by matching fixed left with wild right.\n        Let y = number of pairs formed by matching fixed right with wild left.\n        Let z = number of pairs formed by matching two wild boots.\n\n        Constraints:\n\n          x <= total_remaining_left_fixed\n          y <= total_remaining_right_fixed\n\n          Also, the total wild boots used in x and y must be available.\n\n          The total wild right boots used in x is x, so we require x <= R_wild_count.\n          Similarly, the total wild left boots used in y is y, so we require y <= L_wild_count.\n\n          Additionally, the two wild boots used in z must satisfy: z <= min(L_wild_count - y, R_wild_count - x) and also the total pairs (T + x + y + z) should be maximized.\n\n        But note: we can also use a wild boot to match a fixed boot and then use the saved wild boot to match another wild boot? Actually, we have to assign the wild boots optimally.\n\n        However, the problem is: we want the maximum total pairs. The total pairs is T + x + y + z, and we are constrained by:\n\n          x <= min(total_remaining_left_fixed, R_wild_count)\n          y <= min(total_remaining_right_fixed, L_wild_count)\n          z <= min(L_wild_count - y, R_wild_count - x)\n\n        But note: we are free to choose x and y (as long as we don't exceed the remaining fixed boots and the available wild boots) and then z is determined by the leftover wild boots.\n\n        Actually, we can set:\n\n          x = min(total_remaining_left_fixed, R_wild_count)\n          y = min(total_remaining_right_fixed, L_wild_count)\n\n        Then, the remaining wild boots are: L_wild_count - y and R_wild_count - x, so we can form z = min(L_wild_count - y, R_wild_count - x) additional pairs.\n\n        Then, total pairs = T + x + y + z.\n\n        But wait, is this optimal? Because we are forced to use the wild boots for the fixed ones first? Actually, we can also use wild boots for fixed boots even if there are wild boots that could be used for matching two wilds? But note: matching two wilds is always possible, but matching a fixed boot with a wild boot is also always possible. However, we want to maximize the total pairs.\n\n        Actually, we can view the entire problem as:\n\n          We have two sets: fixed left (with counts by color) and fixed right (with counts by color). Then we have wild left and wild right.\n\n          The total pairs we can form is:\n\n            First, we can form T = sum_{c} min(L_fixed(c), R_fixed(c))\n\n          Then, we have two types of boots: the unmatched fixed boots and the wild boots.\n\n          The unmatched fixed left boots (say A) and unmatched fixed right boots (say B) and wild left (L_w) and wild right (R_w).\n\n          Now, note: we can match A (fixed left) with R_w (wild right) and B (fixed right) with L_w (wild left). But also, we can match the wild boots together.\n\n          However, we can use the wild boots to cover the fixed boots, and then the leftover wild boots can form pairs among themselves.\n\n          But here is a catch: we cannot use a wild boot to match two different boots. So the total pairs we can form from the remaining fixed and wild is:\n\n            Let M = min(A, R_w)   [matching fixed left with wild right]\n            Then, from the remaining wild right: R_w - M, we can use them for matching with fixed right? Actually, no: because we are going to use the wild boots to cover fixed boots from both sides.\n\n          Actually, we have two independent sets: the unmatched fixed left and unmatched fixed right.\n\n          We can use wild boots to cover:\n\n            - Some of the unmatched fixed left (with wild right)\n            - Some of the unmatched fixed right (with wild left)\n\n          But note: we have two separate sets of wild boots (left and right).\n\n          The total pairs from the wild and fixed is:\n\n            x = min(A, R_w)   [using wild right for fixed left]\n            y = min(B, L_w)   [using wild left for fixed right]\n\n          Then, we are left with:\n\n            R_w' = R_w - x   [remaining wild right]\n            L_w' = L_w - y   [remaining wild left]\n\n          Then, we can form z = min(R_w', L_w') pairs from the wild boots.\n\n          Then total pairs = T + x + y + z.\n\n          Is this the maximum? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use the wild boots to cover the fixed boots and then use the leftover wild boots arbitrarily. But note: we can also decide to use a wild boot to cover a fixed boot even if there is an alternative? However, the goal is to maximize the total pairs.\n\n          This approach gives:\n\n            total_pairs = T + x + y + min(R_w - x, L_w - y)\n\n          And we cannot get more than n pairs.\n\n        However, the problem is: we must output the actual pairs. We need to know which left boot and which right boot to match.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          We are going to:\n\n            Step 1: Count the fixed boots by color.\n\n            Step 2: For each color, match the fixed boots of that color. We must remember which indices are used.\n\n            Step 3: Then, for the remaining fixed left boots (by color) and fixed right boots (by color), we will try to match them with wild boots.\n\n            Step 4: Then, the leftover wild boots (after using some for matching fixed boots) will be matched arbitrarily.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require to maximize the pairs by this particular order. There might be a better way to assign the wild boots to maximize the total pairs? Actually, the above assignment is the maximum because:\n\n          We first use the fixed boots to form as many fixed-fixed pairs as possible (T). Then, we use the wild boots to cover the remaining fixed boots (x and y) and then use the leftover wild boots to form wild-wild pairs.\n\n        However, there is an alternative: sometimes it might be beneficial to use a wild boot to cover a fixed boot that is of a color that has many fixed boots, so that we don't waste a wild boot on a rare color? But our calculation above uses the fact that we can match any fixed boot with a wild boot, regardless of color. So the above formula is valid.\n\n        But wait: the above formula is independent of color. However, we must assign the fixed boots to wild boots. We have to be careful: we cannot assign a wild boot to two fixed boots.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n          We need to:\n\n            - Record the indices for fixed boots and wild boots.\n\n            - For fixed-fixed matching: we can use a dictionary for left and right fixed boots (with lists of indices). Then, for each color, we match the smallest indices? Actually, the problem does not specify which pairs to output, so we can choose arbitrarily.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Precompute:\n\n              L_fixed = defaultdict(list)   # color -> list of indices (left)\n              R_fixed = defaultdict(list)   # color -> list of indices (right)\n              L_wild_indices = []   # list of indices for left wild\n              R_wild_indices = []   # list of indices for right wild\n\n            Then, for fixed-fixed matching:\n\n              For each color in L_fixed:\n                  common = min(len(L_fixed[color]), len(R_fixed[color]))\n                  Then, we take the first 'common' from both lists? But we have to output the pairs. We can sort the lists by index? Actually, we don't care about the order, but we must not use the same index twice.\n\n              However, we must assign the fixed boots of the same color arbitrarily. We can take the first 'common' from L_fixed[color] and the first 'common' from R_fixed[color] (if we sort the lists by index, then we can take the smallest indices first? Actually, the problem does not specify which pairs, so we can do arbitrary matching.\n\n            But note: the problem requires to output the pairs (and the indices). We must output the left boot index and the right boot index.\n\n            We can do:\n\n              For each color c:\n                  Sort the list of indices for left and right (so that we can assign the smallest available indices first? Actually, the problem does not specify order, but we must not use the same index twice. So we can just match the i-th smallest left index with the i-th smallest right index for the same color.\n\n            Then, we record which indices are used for fixed-fixed.\n\n            Then, for the remaining fixed boots (the ones that were not matched in the fixed-fixed matching) we have:\n\n              Left remaining fixed: for each color, the list L_fixed[color] without the first min(|L_fixed[color]|, |R_fixed[color]|) elements.\n\n              Similarly for right.\n\n            Then, we need to match the remaining fixed left boots (from all colors) with the wild right boots. But note: the wild right boots can be any. We have R_wild_indices (a list of indices). We can assign arbitrarily. Similarly for the remaining fixed right boots.\n\n            However, we must not use the same wild boot twice.\n\n            How to assign:\n\n              We want to assign as many as possible:\n\n                x = min(total_remaining_fixed_left, len(R_wild_indices))\n                y = min(total_remaining_fixed_right, len(L_wild_indices))\n\n              But wait, the total_remaining_fixed_left is the total number of fixed left boots that were not matched in fixed-fixed. Similarly for right.\n\n            Then, we can:\n\n              Use x wild right boots to match the first x remaining fixed left boots (we can choose any, but we have to avoid using the same index twice). Similarly, use y wild left boots to match the first y remaining fixed right boots.\n\n            Then, the remaining wild boots (both left and right) are:\n\n              R_wild_remaining = R_wild_indices without the x ones we used.\n              L_wild_remaining = L_wild_indices without the y ones we used.\n\n            Then, we can match the remaining wild boots arbitrarily (each left wild with a right wild) until we run out.\n\n            But note: we are allowed to use the wild boots arbitrarily. So we can form min(len(R_wild_remaining), len(L_wild_remaining)) pairs from the remaining wild boots.\n\n            Then, the total pairs is T + x + y + min(len(R_wild_remaining), len(L_wild_remaining))\n\n            But wait, is that correct? Actually, note that the fixed-fixed pairs are T. Then, the fixed-wild pairs are x (for left fixed with right wild) and y (for right fixed with left wild). Then, the wild-wild pairs are the leftover.\n\n            However, note: we have to assign the fixed boots to wild boots. We have two separate groups: fixed left and fixed right. We cannot use the same wild boot for two fixed boots.\n\n            Steps for matching:\n\n              Step 1: Precompute fixed-fixed matching (T) and mark the indices used.\n\n              Step 2: Collect the remaining fixed left and fixed right (by color and by index).\n\n              Step 3: For the remaining fixed left, we have a list (all indices). Similarly for fixed right.\n\n              Step 4: We want to use as few wild boots as possible for the fixed boots? Actually, we want to maximize the total pairs, and we have already matched T pairs. The maximum total pairs we can form is n (if we use all boots). But note: we are forming T + (number of fixed left we can cover) + (number of fixed right we can cover) + (number of wild left and wild right left). \n\n              However, we have:\n\n                total_fixed_left_initial = n_fixed_left = len(L_fixed_indices) [but wait, we have wild and fixed separated, so total left boots is n = len(L_fixed_indices) + len(L_wild_indices). Similarly for right.\n\n              We are going to:\n\n                total_fixed_left_remaining = total_fixed_left_initial - T\n                total_fixed_right_remaining = total_fixed_right_initial - T\n\n              Then, we can use up to total_fixed_left_remaining from the wild right, and total_fixed_right_remaining from the wild left.\n\n              Then, the maximum pairs we can form is:\n\n                T + min(total_fixed_left_remaining, len(R_wild_indices)) + min(total_fixed_right_remaining, len(L_wild_indices)) + min( len(R_wild_indices) - min(total_fixed_left_remaining, len(R_wild_indices)), len(L_wild_indices) - min(total_fixed_right_remaining, len(L_wild_indices)) )\n\n              But wait, the above expression is the same as:\n\n                T + x + y + min( len(R_wild_indices) - x, len(L_wild_indices) - y )\n\n              where x = min(total_fixed_left_remaining, len(R_wild_indices)) and y = min(total_fixed_right_remaining, len(L_wild_indices)).\n\n            However, we must output the pairs.\n\n            Implementation details:\n\n              We need to:\n\n                - Record the fixed-fixed matches: we know which indices are used in fixed-fixed.\n\n                - Then, for the remaining fixed left boots, we have a list of indices (we can collect them by iterating over the colors and taking the leftover). Similarly for fixed right.\n\n                - Then, we assign the remaining fixed left boots to wild right boots arbitrarily (we can use the smallest available wild right boot for the smallest remaining fixed left boot? But the problem does not require any particular order). Similarly for fixed right and wild left.\n\n                - Then, for the leftover wild boots (both left and right), we can form pairs arbitrarily. We can sort the leftover wild left and wild right and then pair the smallest left index with the smallest right index, etc.\n\n            But wait: we must not use the same index twice. We have to keep track of which indices are already used.\n\n            We can do:\n\n              We'll maintain two sets (or lists) of used indices.\n\n            Alternatively, we can precompute:\n\n              Step 1: Create arrays for left and right: we know the entire list of indices (from 1 to n, but note: the input indices are 1-indexed? Actually, the problem says: the j-th line should contain the index of the left boot and the index of the right boot.\n\n              The input: the first boot is index 1, second is index 2, etc.\n\n              Our indices: we are using 0-indexed internally, but output 1-indexed.\n\n            Steps:\n\n              Read n, then two strings.\n\n              Let n = int(input().strip())\n              l_str = input().strip()\n              r_str = input().strip()\n\n              We'll create:\n\n                L_fixed = {}   # dictionary: color -> list of indices (0-indexed)\n                L_wild = []    # list of indices (0-indexed)\n\n                Similarly for R_fixed and R_wild.\n\n              Then:\n\n                For i in range(n):\n                    char = l_str[i]\n                    if char != '?':\n                        if char not in L_fixed:\n                            L_fixed[char] = []\n                        L_fixed[char].append(i)\n                    else:\n                        L_wild.append(i)\n\n                Similarly for r_str.\n\n            Then, Step 1: fixed-fixed matching.\n\n                We'll create a list for the final pairs (to output) and mark which indices are used.\n\n                Alternatively, we can:\n\n                  For each color in L_fixed:\n                      if color in R_fixed:\n                          # We have to match min(L_fixed[color], R_fixed[color]) pairs.\n                          Let a = sorted(L_fixed[color])\n                          Let b = sorted(R_fixed[color])\n                          Then, for j in range(min(len(a), len(b))):\n                              We match a[j] (left index) with b[j] (right index)\n\n                But wait: what if the color is not in R_fixed? Then we don't match any.\n\n            However, we must consider: the fixed-fixed matching is only for colors that appear in both.\n\n            Then, we remove these matched indices from the fixed sets and wild sets? Actually, we don't remove from fixed sets, but we can keep the remaining fixed sets.\n\n            Alternatively, we can:\n\n                For each color, we take the minimum of the two counts and then remove that many from both.\n\n                But we have to output the pairs.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                pairs = []   # list of (left_index, right_index) for each pair\n\n                For each color in set(L_fixed.keys()) | set(R_fixed.keys()):\n                    # But we only consider colors that are in both?\n                    # Actually, if a color is only in L_fixed, then we cannot form fixed-fixed pairs for that color.\n                    if color in L_fixed and color in R_fixed:\n                        left_list = L_fixed[color]\n                        right_list = R_fixed[color]\n                        k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n                        # We need to choose k pairs. But which ones? We can choose arbitrarily. However, we want to reserve the best for later? Not necessary, because the wild matching doesn't care about color.\n\n                        # We can simply take the first k from left_list and the first k from right_list? But we must not use the same index twice.\n\n                        # But note: we are going to use the entire set of fixed boots. We have to remember that the same index appears only once.\n\n                        # However, we are going to remove the used indices from the fixed sets and then use the remaining for matching with wild.\n\n                        # But wait: we are going to use the same index only once. So we must assign distinct indices.\n\n                        # We can sort the left_list and right_list and then take the first k from each.\n\n                        left_list.sort()\n                        right_list.sort()\n                        for j in range(k):\n                            # We use left_list[j] and right_list[j]\n                            pairs.append( (left_list[j], right_list[j]) )\n\n                        # Then, we remove these k indices from L_fixed[color] and R_fixed[color]? Actually, we don't need to store the remaining fixed boots by color if we are going to use a global list of remaining fixed left and fixed right.\n\n                But then we lose the information of the remaining fixed boots.\n\n            Better: we don't break the original lists by color for the remaining fixed boots. Instead, we can:\n\n                Step 1: For each color, match the fixed boots of that color (min(L_fixed[color], R_fixed[color])) and record these pairs.\n\n                Step 2: Then, we create two sets:\n\n                    remaining_fixed_left_indices = set(all left indices that are fixed) - set(all left indices that were used in fixed-fixed pairs)\n                    remaining_fixed_right_indices = set(all right indices that are fixed) - set(all right indices that were used in fixed-fixed pairs)\n\n                But wait: we don't have the entire set of fixed left indices? We built L_fixed by color, so we can combine:\n\n                    all_fixed_left_indices = [idx for sublist in L_fixed.values() for idx in sublist]\n                    Then, the used ones are the ones we took in the fixed-fixed matching.\n\n            Alternatively, we can:\n\n                Create two dictionaries for the fixed boots (left and right) and then for each color, we remove the matched ones.\n\n            However, we can do:\n\n                Let's create:\n\n                    fixed_left_indices = set()\n                    fixed_right_indices = set()\n\n                Then, for each color, we have the list of indices for left and right. Then, we can do:\n\n                    used_left = set()\n                    used_right = set()\n\n                Then, for each color in L_fixed:\n                    if color in R_fixed:\n                        left_list = sorted(L_fixed[color])\n                        right_list = sorted(R_fixed[color])\n                        k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n                        for j in range(k):\n                            i_left = left_list[j]\n                            i_right = right_list[j]\n                            pairs.append( (i_left, i_right) )\n                            used_left.add(i_left)\n                            used_right.add(i_right)\n\n                Then, the remaining fixed left indices = all fixed left indices (which we can get from the keys) but wait, we don't have a master list. Alternatively, we can:\n\n                    remaining_fixed_left = [idx for color, lst in L_fixed.items() for idx in lst if idx not in used_left]\n                    remaining_fixed_right = [idx for color, lst in R_fixed.items() for idx in lst if idx not in used_right]\n\n            Then, we have:\n\n                x = min(len(remaining_fixed_left), len(R_wild))\n                y = min(len(remaining_fixed_right), len(L_wild))\n\n            Now, how to assign the remaining fixed left to the wild right? We have a list of wild right indices (R_wild) and we want to assign the first x remaining fixed left indices to the first x wild right indices? But we must output the pairs.\n\n            We can:\n\n                Sort the remaining_fixed_left and R_wild (or not, but we must output the pairs arbitrarily). The problem does not specify order.\n\n                We can assign:\n\n                  For the first x remaining_fixed_left (we can take the smallest indices or the largest? arbitrary) and the first x wild right indices (again arbitrary). Similarly for the other.\n\n            Then, for the wild-wild matching, we have:\n\n                leftover_wild_left = set(L_wild) - set(the y wild left indices we used for matching fixed right)\n                leftover_wild_right = set(R_wild) - set(the x wild right indices we used for matching fixed left)\n\n                Then, we can form min(len(leftover_wild_left), len(leftover_wild_right)) pairs.\n\n                How to assign? We can take the smallest indices from the leftover_wild_left and the smallest from leftover_wild_right and pair them.\n\n            Steps for matching the remaining fixed with wild:\n\n                We have two independent assignments:\n\n                  Assignment 1: match the remaining_fixed_left (any order) with x wild right boots (any order). We can choose:\n\n                      Option 1: take the first x from remaining_fixed_left and the first x from R_wild (both in increasing order of index) and then pair the i-th smallest fixed left with the i-th smallest wild right.\n\n                  Similarly for Assignment 2: match the remaining_fixed_right (any order) with y wild left boots.\n\n            Then, for the wild-wild matching, we take the remaining wild boots (left and right) and sort both, then pair the smallest left with the smallest right.\n\n            However, note: we must output the pairs in any order. But the problem requires the output format:\n\n                Print k (the total pairs) and then k lines: first the left boot index and then the right boot index.\n\n            Important: the problem does not require the pairs to be output in any particular order.\n\n            But note: we are matching by index, and the indices are from 0 to n-1 (then we output index+1).\n\n            Implementation:\n\n                Step 1: Read input.\n\n                Step 2: Separate the indices for fixed and wild for left and right.\n\n                Step 3: Do fixed-fixed matching (for each color present in both) and record the pairs and the used indices.\n\n                Step 4: Collect the remaining fixed left and fixed right indices.\n\n                Step 5: Let x = min(len(remaining_fixed_left), len(R_wild))\n                         y = min(len(remaining_fixed_right), len(L_wild))\n\n                Step 6: Now, we have to assign:\n\n                    For the fixed-left remaining: we have a list of indices (call it listA). We can sort listA arbitrarily, but we must not mix with the wild ones.\n\n                    Similarly, for the fixed-right remaining: listB.\n\n                    Then, we assign:\n\n                      For j in range(x):\n                          left_index = listA[j]   # or we can use the j-th smallest element in listA\n                          right_index = R_wild[j]   # but wait, R_wild is a list of wild right indices. We should sort R_wild and then take the first x.\n\n                    But wait: we have not sorted R_wild. We have the list of indices for wild right. We can sort R_wild and then take the first x.\n\n                    Similarly for L_wild for the fixed-right matching.\n\n                However, we must be cautious: we are going to use the same wild boot only once.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    Sort the list of remaining_fixed_left (listA) and the list of R_wild (and similarly for the others). Then, we assign the smallest remaining fixed left to the smallest available wild right, etc.\n\n                Why? Because the problem does not specify, but this is a common greedy matching.\n\n                But note: the problem does not require any particular order, so we can do that.\n\n                However, we must not use the same wild boot twice. So we use the smallest x wild right boots for the smallest x remaining fixed left boots.\n\n                Similarly for the other.\n\n                Then, for the wild-wild matching:\n\n                    We have:\n\n                      leftover_L_wild = set(L_wild) - set(the y indices we used from L_wild for matching fixed right)\n                      leftover_R_wild = set(R_wild) - set(the x indices we used from R_wild for matching fixed left)\n\n                    Then, we take the sorted list of leftover_L_wild and leftover_R_wild, and then form pairs by taking the smallest from the left and the smallest from the right.\n\n                Then, the total pairs = T (from fixed-fixed) + x + y + z (where z = min(len(leftover_L_wild), len(leftover_R_wild)))\n\n                But wait: we are not using the entire T? Actually, T is the number of fixed-fixed pairs.\n\n            However, note: the above procedure might not be optimal in terms of maximizing the total pairs? But we have:\n\n                Total pairs = T + x + y + min(|leftover_L_wild|, |leftover_R_wild|)\n\n                And we defined x and y as the maximum we can assign for fixed-left and fixed-right respectively.\n\n            But wait: the formula for the maximum total pairs is:\n\n                T + min(remaining_fixed_left, len(R_wild)) + min(remaining_fixed_right, len(L_wild)) + min( len(R_wild) - min(remaining_fixed_left, len(R_wild)), len(L_wild) - min(remaining_fixed_right, len(L_wild)) )\n\n            However, note: we are using the same wild boots for two different purposes: matching fixed left and matching fixed right. And then the leftover wild boots are used for matching with each other.\n\n            But the above steps:\n\n                We first use the wild boots for fixed left and fixed right. Then the leftover is used for wild-wild.\n\n            This is the same as:\n\n                total_pairs = T + x + y + min(len(L_wild) - y, len(R_wild) - x)\n\n            And that is the maximum.\n\n            Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                l_str = input().strip()\n                r_str = input().strip()\n\n                # Build data structures\n                L_fixed = {}   # color -> list of indices (0-indexed)\n                L_wild = []    # list of indices\n                for i, char in enumerate(l_str):\n                    if char == '?':\n                        L_wild.append(i)\n                    else:\n                        if char not in L_fixed:\n                            L_fixed[char] = []\n                        L_fixed[char].append(i)\n\n                R_fixed = {}\n                R_wild = []\n                for i, char in enumerate(r_str):\n                    if char == '?':\n                        R_wild.append(i)\n                    else:\n                        if char not in R_fixed:\n                            R_fixed[char] = []\n                        R_fixed[char].append(i)\n\n                # Step 3: fixed-fixed matching\n                pairs = []   # list of (left_index, right_index) for all pairs\n\n                # We'll keep track of used indices for fixed boots?

Actually, we don't care, but we need to avoid using the same index twice.\n\n                # We'll create a set for used indices for left and right in fixed-fixed? Or we can use the fact that we are going to remove the used ones from the fixed sets.\n\n                # Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                #   For each color in the intersection of keys of L_fixed and R_fixed.\n\n                # But what if a color is only in one?

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of boots (left and right) where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot with compatible colors. A color is compatible if they are the same or if either is a wildcard ('?'). The solution involves efficiently matching the boots while ensuring no boot is used more than once.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching left and right boots based on their colors, where '?' can match any color. The goal is to form the maximum number of pairs without reusing any boot.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves three main steps:\n   - **Fixed-Fixed Matching**: Match boots with specific colors (non '?') that are the same on both sides.\n   - **Fixed-Wild Matching**: Use wildcard boots to match remaining boots with specific colors.\n   - **Wild-Wild Matching**: Pair leftover wildcard boots with each other.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Fixed-Fixed Matching**: For each color present in both left and right boots, match the smallest indices first to maximize the use of available boots.\n   - **Fixed-Wild Matching**: After fixed-fixed matching, use the smallest remaining specific boots with the smallest wildcards.\n   - **Wild-Wild Matching**: The remaining wildcards are paired based on their indices.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each boot in linear time, making it efficient with O(n log n) due to sorting, where n is the number of boots (up to 150,000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data: \n        return\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    l_str = data[1].strip()\n    r_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    L_fixed = {}\n    L_wild = []\n    for i, char in enumerate(l_str):\n        if char == '?':\n            L_wild.append(i)\n        else:\n            if char not in L_fixed:\n                L_fixed[char] = []\n            L_fixed[char].append(i)\n            \n    R_fixed = {}\n    R_wild = []\n    for i, char in enumerate(r_str):\n        if char == '?':\n            R_wild.append(i)\n        else:\n            if char not in R_fixed:\n                R_fixed[char] = []\n            R_fixed[char].append(i)\n            \n    pairs = []\n    \n    for color in set(L_fixed.keys()) & set(R_fixed.keys()):\n        left_list = L_fixed[color]\n        right_list = R_fixed[color]\n        k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n        left_list.sort()\n        right_list.sort()\n        for j in range(k):\n            pairs.append((left_list[j], right_list[j]))\n            \n    used_left = set()\n    used_right = set()\n    for (a, b) in pairs:\n        used_left.add(a)\n        used_right.add(b)\n        \n    remaining_fixed_left = []\n    for color, lst in L_fixed.items():\n        for idx in lst:\n            if idx not in used_left:\n                remaining_fixed_left.append(idx)\n                \n    remaining_fixed_right = []\n    for color, lst in R_fixed.items():\n        for idx in lst:\n            if idx not in used_right:\n                remaining_fixed_right.append(idx)\n                \n    x = min(len(remaining_fixed_left), len(R_wild))\n    y = min(len(remaining_fixed_right), len(L_wild))\n    \n    remaining_fixed_left.sort()\n    remaining_fixed_right.sort()\n    R_wild.sort()\n    L_wild.sort()\n    \n    for j in range(x):\n        left_idx = remaining_fixed_left[j]\n        right_idx = R_wild[j]\n        pairs.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n        \n    for j in range(y):\n        left_idx = L_wild[j]\n        right_idx = remaining_fixed_right[j]\n        pairs.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n        \n    L_wild_remaining = L_wild[y:]\n    R_wild_remaining = R_wild[x:]\n    \n    L_wild_remaining.sort()\n    R_wild_remaining.sort()\n    \n    z = min(len(L_wild_remaining), len(R_wild_remaining))\n    for j in range(z):\n        left_idx = L_wild_remaining[j]\n        right_idx = R_wild_remaining[j]\n        pairs.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n        \n    total_pairs = len(pairs)\n    print(total_pairs)\n    for (a, b) in pairs:\n        print(f\"{a+1} {b+1}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of boots and two strings representing left and right boot colors.\n2. **Categorizing Boots**: Boots are categorized into fixed (specific colors) and wildcards ('?').\n3. **Fixed-Fixed Matching**: For each color present in both left and right boots, the smallest indices are matched first.\n4. **Fixed-Wild Matching**: Remaining specific boots are matched with the smallest available wildcards.\n5. **Wild-Wild Matching**: Leftover wildcards are paired based on their indices.\n6. **Output**: The total number of pairs is printed, followed by each pair's indices (converted to 1-based).\n\nThis approach ensures maximum compatibility by prioritizing specific matches and efficiently utilizing wildcards, providing an optimal solution within feasible time complexity.",
