    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The problem states that the first ring goes along the edge of the plate (which is a rectangle of w x h).\n Then, the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge, and so on.\n\n Each ring has a width of 1 cell. The i-th ring is defined for the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)).\n But note: the rings are drawn by taking the bordering cells of that inner rectangle.\n\n However, note that the ring is the border of the inner rectangle, which has width 1. So the number of cells in the i-th ring is:\n   Let n_i = w - 4*(i-1) and m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n   Then, the border (ring) of an n_i x m_i rectangle is:\n        If n_i <= 0 or m_i <= 0, then we cannot form a ring (but k is guaranteed to be at most floor(min(n, m)/4 + 1) but actually the condition is provided, so we don't have to worry about negative).\n\n   The formula for the perimeter (with outer border) is: \n        For a rectangle of dimensions n_i x m_i, the border has:\n          top and bottom: each has m_i cells, but subtract the corners if we are just counting the border? Actually, we are including the entire border.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the border as:\n          total = 2 * (n_i + m_i) - 4   [because each side has length, but the four corners are shared]\n\n        However, wait: let's check with the example.\n\n Example 1: Input \"3 3 1\"\n   w=3, h=3, k=1.\n   First ring: rectangle is 3x3.\n   The border: top row: 3, bottom row: 3, left column without top and bottom: 1, right column without top and bottom: 1 -> total 3+3+1+1 = 8.\n\n   Using the formula: 2*(3+3)-4 = 2*6-4 = 12-4 = 8 -> matches.\n\n Example 2: Input \"7 9 1\"\n   w=7, h=9, k=1.\n   Rectangle is 7x9.\n   Using the formula: 2*(7+9)-4 = 2*16-4 = 32-4 = 28 -> matches.\n\n Example 3: Input \"7 9 2\"\n   First ring: 7x9 -> 2*(7+9)-4 = 28\n   Second ring: i=2, then the inner rectangle is (7-4*(2-1)) x (9-4*(2-1)) = (7-4) x (9-4) = 3x5.\n   Then the border for 3x5: 2*(3+5)-4 = 2*8-4 = 16-4 = 12.\n   Total = 28 + 12 = 40 -> matches.\n\n But wait, the example output for \"7 9 2\" is 40.\n\n However, note: the problem says the first ring goes along the edge, the second one 2 cells away, etc. And each ring is drawn by the border of the inner rectangle.\n\n Therefore, we can compute the total number of gilded cells by summing up the borders for i from 1 to k.\n\n Steps:\n  1. Read the input line and split into w, h, k (convert to integers).\n  2. Initialize total_gilded = 0.\n  3. For i in range(1, k+1):\n        n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n        If either n_i <= 0 or m_i <= 0, then we break out because there are no more rings (but the problem says k is at most floor(min(w,h)/4+1), so we won't have negative, but we still need to check for zero? Actually, when the inner rectangle becomes too small, we stop. However, the condition on k ensures that we don't go beyond the plate. But note: the problem says k is at least 1 and at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n        Then, the number of cells for this ring is: 2*(n_i + m_i) - 4.\n\n        However, wait: what if the inner rectangle is 1x1? Then the border would be 1 cell? But our formula: 2*(1+1)-4 = 0. That's not correct.\n\n        Actually, the formula for the border of a rectangle only works if the rectangle has at least 2 rows and 2 columns (so that there is a border). In fact, the border is defined as the outer layer. For a 1x1, the border is the whole cell. For a 2x2, the border is 4 cells.\n\n        Let's check with 2x2: \n            Using formula: 2*(2+2)-4 = 8-4 = 4 -> correct.\n\n        Now, 1x1: \n            Formula gives 2*(1+1)-4 = 0, but it should be 1.\n\n        So we must handle the case when the inner rectangle is 1x1 separately.\n\n        Actually, the problem states: the plate is split into w x h cells, and the rings are defined for inner rectangles that are at least 1x1. But note the condition on k: k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n        Let's see: for w=3, h=3, k=1: min(w,h)=3, then floor((3+1)/4)=floor(4/4)=1 -> so k=1 is allowed.\n\n        For the first ring, the inner rectangle is 3x3. Then the next ring would be 3-4=-1, which is invalid. So k=1 is the maximum.\n\n        Now, if we have a plate of 4x4, then k is at most floor((4+1)/4)=floor(5/4)=1. Then the first ring is 4x4: the border is 2*(4+4)-4=16-4=12. Then the next ring would be 0x0, which is invalid, so k=1.\n\n        But what if we have a plate of 5x5? Then k is at most floor((5+1)/4)=floor(6/4)=1. Then the first ring: 5x5 -> border: 2*(5+5)-4=20-4=16. Then the next ring: 5-4=1, so 1x1. Then we have to account for the 1x1 border.\n\n        So we must adjust: the formula 2*(n_i+m_i)-4 is valid only when both n_i and m_i are at least 2. When the rectangle is 1x1, we have 1 cell.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think: the border is the set of cells that are on the perimeter of the rectangle. For a rectangle of size n_i x m_i (with n_i>=1, m_i>=1):\n\n          If n_i == 1 and m_i == 1: then 1 cell.\n          Otherwise, the border is: \n              top row: m_i\n              bottom row: m_i\n              left column: n_i - 2 (if n_i>1 then we subtract the two corners already counted in top and bottom)\n              right column: n_i - 2\n\n          So total = m_i * 2 + (n_i - 2) * 2 = 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4.\n\n        This formula works for n_i>=2 and m_i>=2. But if one of them is 1?\n\n        Example: 1x5: \n          top row: 5, bottom row: 5, then left and right columns: n_i-2 = -1 -> doesn't work.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          total = 2*(n_i + m_i) - 4   [for n_i>=2 and m_i>=2] \n          but if n_i==1 and m_i>=2: then the border is just the entire rectangle (which is a single row of m_i cells). Similarly, if m_i==1 and n_i>=2, then the border is the entire rectangle (a single column of n_i cells). And if both are 1, then 1 cell.\n\n        Actually, the problem says the plate is at least 3x3 and k is limited by the condition, so the smallest inner rectangle we get might be 1x1 (if k is large enough) or even 0x0? But the condition says k <= floor(min(n, m)/4 + 1) (actually, the condition is k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)). \n\n        Let me recalculate the condition: \n          Given w, h (at least 3), k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4).\n\n        Example: w=3, h=3 -> k<= floor((3+1)/4)=1 -> so we only get the first ring (3x3) and then we don't try to compute the second ring.\n\n        How about w=5, h=5: \n          k <= floor((5+1)/4)=floor(6/4)=1 -> so we only do the first ring (5x5) and then stop.\n\n        But wait, the example \"7 9 2\": \n          w=7, h=9 -> min(w, h)=7, then floor((7+1)/4)=floor(8/4)=2 -> so k=2 is allowed.\n\n        So the minimal inner rectangle for k=2 in 7x9 is 7-4=3 and 9-4=5, so 3x5. Then the next ring would be 3-4=-1 (invalid) so we stop at k=2.\n\n        Now, how do we compute the border for a 3x5?\n          We can use: \n            If the rectangle has at least 2 rows and 2 columns, use 2*(n_i+m_i)-4.\n            Otherwise, if n_i==1: then the entire row is the border (m_i cells) but wait, if n_i==1 then we have one row, so the top and bottom are the same row, and the left and right are the same row. Then the border is the entire row: m_i.\n            Similarly, if m_i==1: then the entire column is the border: n_i.\n\n        But note: in the 3x5 example, n_i=3 and m_i=5, both >=2, so we use the formula: 2*(3+5)-4 = 16-4=12.\n\n        However, what if we have a 1x5? Then the border is 5. But according to the problem, the ring is defined as the bordering cells of the inner rectangle. The inner rectangle 1x5: \n          The border is the entire rectangle (since there's only one row and one column) so indeed 5.\n\n        Similarly, 5x1: 5.\n\n        And 1x1: 1.\n\n        So we can write:\n\n          if n_i < 2 or m_i < 2:\n              # Then we are in the case where one dimension is 1 or both are 1.\n              # The border is the entire rectangle (each cell is on the border).\n              total_cells = n_i * m_i\n          else:\n              total_cells = 2*(n_i + m_i) - 4\n\n        But wait, is that correct for 1x1? \n          n_i=1, m_i=1 -> 1*1 = 1 -> correct.\n          1x5: 1*5 = 5 -> correct.\n          5x1: 5*1 = 5 -> correct.\n\n        However, note that the problem says the ring has a width of 1 cell, and the ring is defined as the border of the inner rectangle. In the case of 1x1, the entire rectangle is the border. In the case of 1x5, the entire rectangle is the border. Similarly for 5x1.\n\n        But is that consistent with the problem statement? The problem says: \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle\". \n\n        The bordering cells of a rectangle are the cells that are on the boundary. For a 1x1, the only cell is the boundary. For a 1x5, every cell is on the boundary (there's only one row, so the top and bottom are the same row, and the sides are the same as the ends). \n\n        However, the problem also says: \"the first one should go along the edge of the plate\", and then the second one 2 cells away, etc. \n\n        But note: the inner rectangle for the second ring in the example 7x9 is 3x5, which is still >=2 in both dimensions.\n\n        Now, the condition on k: k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). This condition ensures that we don't go below 1 in any dimension? Not exactly, because if w=5, h=5, then k<=1, so the next ring would be 1x1, but we don't compute it because k=1. But if we had a larger k, say k=2 for w=5, h=5, then the condition would not allow k=2 because floor((5+1)/4)=1.\n\n        However, the problem says: k is at least 1 and at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). So we are guaranteed that for the last ring we compute, the inner rectangle will have at least 1 cell in each dimension? \n\n        Actually, let me check the condition: \n          The i-th ring uses a rectangle of (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)).\n          The minimal value for the inner rectangle is when i=k: \n            w_min = w - 4*(k-1) >= w - 4*((min(w,h)+1)//4 - 1) ??? \n\n        Alternatively, we can rely on the condition that k is chosen such that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is at least 1x1? Not necessarily: for example, if w=3, h=3, k=1: inner rectangle is 3x3 (>=2). \n        But if we have w=4, h=4, k= floor((4+1)/4)=1: then the inner rectangle is 4x4 (>=2). \n        What if w=7, h=7, k=floor((7+1)/4)=2: \n            First ring: 7x7 -> valid (>=2)\n            Second ring: 7-4=3, 7-4=3 -> 3x3 (>=2) -> valid.\n\n        What if w=8, h=8, k=floor((8+1)/4)=floor(9/4)=2: \n            First: 8x8 -> valid.\n            Second: 8-4=4, 8-4=4 -> valid.\n\n        But wait, the condition says: k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n        Actually, the problem states: \n          k is at least 1 and at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)\n\n        This condition might not ensure that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is at least 1x1? \n\n        Let me compute the minimal inner rectangle for the k-th ring: \n            n_k = w - 4*(k-1) >= w - 4*((min(w, h)+1)//4 - 1) ??? \n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the condition on k is such that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is positive. \n\n        However, the problem says: the rings are defined until the inner rectangle becomes too small. But the condition on k is given by the problem, so we can assume that the k-th ring is defined and the inner rectangle has nonnegative dimensions (and the problem condition ensures that the k-th ring is defined).\n\n        But note: the condition is k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n        Let's define:\n            Let d = min(w, h)\n            Then k_max = floor((d+1)/4)\n\n            Then the inner rectangle for the k_max-th ring is: d - 4*(k_max-1)\n\n            We need to check if d - 4*(k_max-1) >= 1? \n\n        Example: d=3 -> k_max=1 -> 3-0=3>=1 -> ok.\n        d=4 -> k_max= (4+1)//4 = 5//4 = 1 -> 4>=1 -> ok.\n        d=5 -> k_max= (5+1)//4=6//4=1 -> 5>=1 -> ok.\n        d=6 -> k_max= (6+1)//4=7//4=1 -> 6>=1 -> ok.\n        d=7 -> k_max= (7+1)//4=8//4=2 -> 7-4=3>=1 -> ok.\n        d=8 -> k_max= (8+1)//4=9//4=2 -> 8-4*1=4>=1 -> ok.\n        d=9 -> k_max= (9+1)//4=10//4=2 -> 9-4=5>=1 -> ok.\n        d=10 -> k_max= (10+1)//4=11//4=2 -> 10-4=6>=1 -> ok.\n        d=11 -> k_max= (11+1)//4=12//4=3 -> 11-4*2=11-8=3>=1 -> ok.\n        d=12 -> k_max= (12+1)//4=13//4=3 -> 12-8=4>=1 -> ok.\n\n        Actually, the condition ensures that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring (with k up to k_max) is at least 1 in the smaller dimension.\n\n        However, note that the condition is on the original min(w, h). But the inner rectangle's minimum dimension is (min(w, h) - 4*(k-1)). \n\n        Since k <= (min(w, h)+1)//4, then:\n            min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) >= min(w, h) - 4*((min(w, h)+1)//4 - 1) ?\n\n        But note: (min(w, h)+1)//4 is integer division (floor). \n\n        Actually, we can see that the minimal inner rectangle dimension is at least 1 (from the above examples). \n\n        However, we must consider that the inner rectangle has two dimensions: \n            n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n            m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n        We require that both n_i and m_i are at least 1 (otherwise we break). But the condition on k is based on the original min(w, h). \n\n        Since k_max = floor((min(w, h)+1)/4), then the smallest dimension of the inner rectangle for the k_max-th ring is:\n            min(w, h) - 4*(k_max-1) >= 1   (as shown above)\n\n        But note: the other dimension (the larger one) is at least the same? Actually, no, because we subtract the same amount from both. \n\n        Example: w=7, h=9, k_max= floor((7+1)/4)=2, then the second ring: 7-4=3, 9-4=5 -> both >=1.\n\n        However, what if w=3, h=100, then k_max = floor((3+1)/4)=1. Then the inner rectangle for the first ring is 3x100, which is valid.\n\n        So we can safely use the formula:\n\n          if n_i >= 2 and m_i >= 2:\n              cells = 2*(n_i + m_i) - 4\n          else:\n              cells = n_i * m_i\n\n        But wait, what if one of them is 0? \n          The condition on k ensures that we don't go below 1, so n_i and m_i are at least 1.\n\n        However, let me test with w=3, h=3, k=1: \n            n_i=3, m_i=3 -> use 2*(3+3)-4=8 -> correct.\n\n        But wait, the example \"3 3 1\" is 8, and we got 8.\n\n        Another example: w=1, h=1, k=1 -> but the input condition says w,h>=3, so we don't have to worry.\n\n        However, what if we have a rectangle that is 1x5? Then we use the else branch: 1*5=5. \n\n        But note: the problem says the plate is at least 3x3, and k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n        Example: w=3, h=3, k=1: we use the if branch.\n\n        Example: w=3, h=4, k_max = floor((3+1)/4)=1 -> so k=1: inner rectangle is 3x4 -> both>=2 -> if branch: 2*(3+4)-4=2*7-4=10.\n\n        But let's count manually for 3x4:\n          Top row: 4\n          Bottom row: 4\n          Left column: middle row (only one row between top and bottom) -> 1\n          Right column: middle row -> 1\n          Total = 4+4+1+1 = 10 -> correct.\n\n        So the plan is:\n\n          total = 0\n          for i in range(1, k+1):\n              n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n              m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n              # Since the problem condition ensures n_i>=1 and m_i>=1, we only need to check if both are at least 2?\n              if n_i >= 2 and m_i >= 2:\n                  ring_cells = 2*(n_i + m_i) - 4\n              else:\n                  ring_cells = n_i * m_i\n\n              total += ring_cells\n\n        However, wait: what if one dimension is 0? The condition of the problem says w, h>=3 and k is bounded, so we shouldn't get negative or zero. But we must be cautious: if we get negative, we break. However, the problem condition ensures that k is chosen such that the inner rectangle is nonnegative. \n\n        But note: the problem condition says k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n        Let me check for w=3, h=3, k=2: \n            k_max = floor((3+1)/4)=1 -> so k=2 is not allowed. So we don't have to worry.\n\n        Therefore, we can code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the condition in the problem is given, so we assume the input k is valid.\n\n        Let me test with the provided examples:\n\n          Example 1: \"3 3 1\" -> w=3, h=3, k=1\n            i=1: n_i=3, m_i=3 -> if branch: 2*(3+3)-4 = 12-4=8 -> total=8.\n\n          Example 2: \"7 9 1\" -> w=7, h=9, k=1\n            i=1: n_i=7, m_i=9 -> if branch: 2*(7+9)-4=32-4=28 -> total=28.\n\n          Example 3: \"7 9 2\" -> w=7, h=9, k=2\n            i=1: 7,9 -> 28\n            i=2: n_i=7-4=3, m_i=9-4=5 -> if branch: 2*(3+5)-4=16-4=12 -> total=40.\n\n        But wait, the example input is given as:\n            ['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n        And expected output: ['8', '28', '40']\n\n        So we output 8, 28, 40.\n\n        However, note: the example input \"7 9 2\" produces 40.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: the first ring is along the edge, then the second one is 2 cells away. In the 7x9 plate, the first ring is the outer border (which is 28). The second ring is the border of the inner rectangle of 3x5 (which is 12). So total 40.\n\n        Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not require to output the intermediate steps, just the total.\n\n        Code:\n\n          w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\n          total = 0\n          for i in range(1, k+1):\n              w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n              h_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n              if w_i < 1 or h_i < 1:\n                  # According to the condition, this should not happen, but if it does, we break.\n                  break\n              if w_i >= 2 and h_i >= 2:\n                  total += 2*(w_i + h_i) - 4\n              else:\n                  total += w_i * h_i\n\n          print(total)\n\n        But wait, what if one dimension becomes 0? The problem condition says k is bounded so that the inner rectangle is at least 1x1, so we shouldn't break. However, if we break on w_i<1 or h_i<1, then we break the loop and the remaining rings are not added. But the condition on k ensures that we don't get negative, so we might not need the break. However, to be safe (if there's an error in the input or condition), we break.\n\n        Alternatively, we can rely solely on the condition that k is within the bound, so we don't break. But if we break, we are safe.\n\n        However, note: the problem says k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n        Let me check: for w=3, h=3, k=2: \n            min(w, h)=3, floor((3+1)/4)=1, so k=2 is invalid. But the problem says k is at least 1 and at most that value. So if we get k=2, then we break at i=2 because w_i = 3-4*(1)= -1 -> negative, so we break and total is only the first ring.\n\n        But the problem says the input k is valid. So we don't have to worry.\n\n        However, the problem condition says: \"the following input contains three integers w, h, k (with conditions)\".\n\n        So we can assume k is valid.\n\n        But note: the condition says k is at least 1 and at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n        We'll assume the input k is valid.\n\n        Final code:\n\n          w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n          total = 0\n          for i in range(k):\n              # i from 0 to k-1, then the ring index is i+1\n              w_i = w - 4*i\n              h_i = h - 4*i\n              # But wait, the problem says the first ring is i=1: then subtract 4*(1-1)=0, then second ring subtract 4*(2-1)=4.\n              # In our loop, if we use i from 0 to k-1, then for the first ring we subtract 4*0, for the second 4*1, etc.\n\n              # However, the problem defines the i-th ring (starting at i=1) as subtracting 4*(i-1). So we can also do:\n\n              # Option 1: use i from 1 to k, then subtract 4*(i-1). \n              # But we can also use i from 0 to k-1 and subtract 4*i, which is equivalent to subtracting 4*(i) for the (i+1)-th ring.\n\n              # Actually, the problem says the first ring: i=1 -> subtract 4*(1-1)=0.\n              # Our current code for the first ring (i=0) subtracts 4*0=0 -> correct.\n\n          So the above code is correct.\n\n        However, note: the example input \"3 3 1\" is processed as:\n            i=0: w_i=3, h_i=3 -> then if 3>=2 and 3>=2 -> 2*(3+3)-4=8.\n\n        But wait, in the problem the first ring is the edge, which is correct.\n\n        However, I just realized: the problem says the first ring is along the edge, then the second one is 2 cells away. The inner rectangle for the second ring is (w-4*(2-1)) = w-4. \n\n        In our code, we did subtract 4*i for the i-th iteration (starting at 0). So for the second ring (i=1) we subtract 4*1=4, which is correct.\n\n        But wait, the problem uses (i-1) for the i-th ring. So for the first ring (i=1) we subtract 4*0, for the second ring (i=2) we subtract 4*1. \n\n        However, in our loop variable i (from 0 to k-1) corresponds to the ring index being i+1. \n\n        Alternatively, we can reframe: \n\n          Let j = i+1 (the ring number). Then the inner rectangle is (w - 4*(j-1)) = (w - 4*i) [because j-1 = i].\n\n        So the code is correct.\n\n        But note: the problem condition says k is the number of rings. We are iterating for k rings.\n\n        One more example: w=5, h=5, k=1: \n            i=0: w_i=5, h_i=5 -> 2*(5+5)-4=20-4=16.\n\n        Manually for 5x5: \n          Top:5, Bottom:5, Left:3 (because 5-2=3), Right:3 -> 5+5+3+3=16. Correct.\n\n        Now, w=5, h=5, k=2: \n            Condition: k_max = floor((5+1)/4)=1 -> so k=2 is not allowed by the problem condition. But if we run the code with k=2, then:\n            i=0: 5,5 -> 16\n            i=1: 5-4=1, 5-4=1 -> then use else: 1*1=1 -> total=17.\n\n        But wait, the problem condition says k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). So if k=2 is given, then it violates the condition. \n\n        However, the problem says: \"the following input contains three integers w, h, k (with conditions)\" so we assume k is valid.\n\n        But the problem also says: \"k is at least 1 and at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)\".\n\n        Therefore, we should not get k=2 for w=5, h=5.\n\n        However, if we do get k=2, then our code will compute 17. But the problem condition says k is valid, so we don't have to worry.\n\n        But note: the problem says the input k satisfies the condition. \n\n        So we assume k is valid.\n\n        Let me run the example from the problem: \n            Input: \"7 9 2\" -> k=2, which is <= floor((7+1)/4)=2, so valid.\n\n        Another example: w=10, h=10, k= floor((10+1)/4)= floor(11/4)=2 -> valid.\n\n        Therefore, we output the code.\n\n        However, wait: the example input \"7 9 2\" is provided, and we computed 40.\n\n        But note: the example input format: the only line contains three integers.\n\n        We read from stdin.\n\n        Code:\n\n          data = input().split()\n          if not data:\n              # but the problem says there is one line with three integers, so skip\n              pass\n          else:\n              w = int(data[0])\n              h = int(data[1])\n              k = int(data[2])\n\n          total = 0\n          for i in range(k):\n              w_i = w - 4*i\n              h_i = h - 4*i\n              if w_i < 1 or h_i < 1:\n                  # This ring and all subsequent rings would be invalid, but k is supposed to be valid so we break.\n                  break\n              if w_i >= 2 and h_i >= 2:\n                  total += 2*(w_i + h_i) - 4\n              else:\n                  total += w_i * h_i\n\n          print(total)\n\n        However, note: the problem says the first ring is the edge (which is the entire plate border). Our first iteration (i=0) gives the entire plate border.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the second ring is 2 cells away. Our second iteration (i=1) subtracts 4, so the inner rectangle is (w-4) x (h-4). That matches.\n\n        We are good.\n\n        However, note: the example \"3 3 1\" produces 8, which is correct.\n\n        But wait, what if the plate is 4x4? Then k_max = floor((4+1)/4)=1. Then the first ring: 4x4 -> 2*(4+4)-4=12. \n\n        Let me count manually for 4x4:\n          Top:4, Bottom:4, Left:2, Right:2 -> 4+4+2+2=12. Correct.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the first ring goes along the edge. For a 4x4 plate, the edge is 12 cells.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        One more: w=100, h=100, k=5 (since floor((100+1)/4)=25, so k=5 is valid). \n\n        We'll compute 5 rings.\n\n        However, the problem constraints are w, h from 3 to 100, and k from 1 to floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n        Since 100 is the maximum, and k_max=25, we are safe.\n\n        Let's compute the first ring for 100x100: 2*(100+100)-4 = 396.\n\n        Second ring: 100-4*1=96, then 2*(96+96)-4= 380.\n\n        Third ring: 100-8=92 -> 2*(92+92)-4= 364.\n\n        Fourth ring: 100-12=88 -> 2*(88+88)-4= 348.\n\n        Fifth ring: 100-16=84 -> 2*(84+84)-4= 332.\n\n        Total=396+380+364+348+332 = 1820.\n\n        We can verify with the formula: \n          Each ring i (0-indexed) has: (w - 4*i) and (h - 4*i) and if both>=2 then 2*(w+h-8*i)-4.\n\n        But wait, we can also use a direct formula without loop? \n\n        However, the problem doesn't require that. We are doing a loop for k rings (k<=25, so maximum 25 iterations, which is acceptable).\n\n        Therefore, the code is efficient.\n\n        Let's run the provided examples:\n\n          Example 1: \"3 3 1\" -> 8\n          Example 2: \"7 9 1\" -> 28\n          Example 3: \"7 9 2\" -> 40\n\n        We output the numbers.\n\n        But wait, the example input is given as a list of strings? Actually, the problem says:\n\n          Input: The only line contains three integers w, h and k.\n\n        So we read one line.\n\n        We are reading one line and splitting.\n\n        Now, we are done.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the plate",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. The first ring is placed along the edge of the plate, and each subsequent ring is placed 2 cells away from the previous one, with each ring having a width of 1 cell. The task is to compute the total number of cells covered by all the rings up to the k-th ring.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the border cells of progressively smaller rectangles inside the original plate. Each ring corresponds to the border of an inner rectangle, which is reduced by 4 cells in both dimensions (width and height) for each subsequent ring. The challenge is to efficiently compute the number of cells in each ring and sum them up.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each ring, the number of cells is determined by the dimensions of the inner rectangle. If both dimensions of the inner rectangle are at least 2, the number of cells is given by the formula \\(2 \\times (n_i + m_i) - 4\\), where \\(n_i\\) and \\(m_i\\) are the width and height of the inner rectangle. If either dimension is less than 2, the entire inner rectangle's cells form the ring.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves iterating from the first to the k-th ring, adjusting the dimensions of the inner rectangle for each iteration, and applying the appropriate formula to count the cells in each ring. The loop runs exactly k times, ensuring all specified rings are processed.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each ring in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of \\(O(k)\\), which is efficient given the constraints (k is at most 25 for a 100x100 plate).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(k):\n        w_i = w - 4 * i\n        h_i = h - 4 * i\n        if w_i < 1 or h_i < 1:\n            break\n        if w_i >= 2 and h_i >= 2:\n            total += 2 * (w_i + h_i) - 4\n        else:\n            total += w_i * h_i\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: the width (w), height (h), and number of rings (k) of the plate.\n2. **Initialization**: A variable `total` is initialized to accumulate the sum of cells in all rings.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k:\n   - **Adjust Dimensions**: The dimensions of the inner rectangle are calculated by subtracting \\(4 \\times i\\) from both width and height, where \\(i\\) is the current ring index (0-based).\n   - **Check Validity**: If either dimension becomes less than 1, the loop breaks as further rings would not be valid.\n   - **Calculate Cells**: If both dimensions are at least 2, the number of cells is computed using the border formula \\(2 \\times (n_i + m_i) - 4\\). Otherwise, the product of the dimensions gives the total cells for that ring.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, the total number of gilded cells is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by leveraging simple arithmetic operations and conditional checks within a loop, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
