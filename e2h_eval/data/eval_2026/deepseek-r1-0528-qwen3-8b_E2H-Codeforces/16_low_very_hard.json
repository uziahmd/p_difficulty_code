Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem.\n\n We are given two points (home and university) and n lines (roads). The roads divide the plane into blocks. We can move from one block to another if they share a nonzero length border. This means we can only cross a road at a time (and then we step from one side to the other).\n\n However, note that the movement condition: moving from one block to another is allowed if the common border has nonzero length. In graph terms, we can think of the blocks as nodes, and an edge exists between two blocks if they share a road segment (i.e., they are adjacent across one road). But note: two blocks that meet only at an intersection (without a common border) do not form an edge.\n\n But here's the catch: the problem says we start in a block (home) and want to get to the university's block. We are allowed to move from one block to an adjacent one (crossing one road) in one step. Then we can also cross multiple roads? Actually, the problem says \"in one step\" you can move from one block to another (adjacent via a nonzero border). So each crossing of a road is a step.\n\n However, note: sometimes we might need to cross several roads. But observe: the minimal number of steps is the same as the minimal number of roads we must cross? Not exactly: because when we cross a road, we go from one block to an adjacent one. But if we have to cross two roads, we cannot do it in one step (unless the two roads meet at an intersection and we cross both at the same time? Let me read again: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". \n\n But note: two blocks that are separated by two different roads (so they are separated by two lines) do not share a common border (they are separated by two lines). Therefore, to go from one block to the target, we must cross every road that separates the two? Actually, no: the home and university might be separated by a set of roads. Each road either separates them or not.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Consider that each road divides the plane into two half-planes. For the home and the university, for each road i, we can determine which side of the road they lie on. Let s_i = 1 if home and university are on the same side of road i, and s_i = -1 if they are on opposite sides.\n\n Now, note: if two points are on the same side of a road, then they are in the same half-plane with respect to that road. When we cross a road, we change the side for that road.\n\n The key observation: To get from the home to the university, we must cross a road if and only if the two points are on opposite sides (because otherwise the road does not separate them). Moreover, we can cross the roads independently? But note: the problem says that we can only move by stepping across a road (with nonzero border) and then we are in an adjacent block. However, we are allowed to cross multiple roads in sequence.\n\n But here is an important fact: the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of roads that separate the two points? Actually, no: consider that if two roads separate the two points, then we must cross both. However, can we cross both in two steps? Or is there a way to cross two roads in one step? The problem states: we can only move from one block to another if they share a common border (which is a segment of one road). Therefore, each step crosses exactly one road.\n\n However, note: sometimes the two points might be separated by two roads, but the two roads might be such that the two half-planes for the two roads together form a connected region? Actually, no: the roads are infinite lines. The entire plane is divided by multiple lines. The two points are separated by a road if they are in opposite half-planes. The minimal path must cross every separating road.\n\n But wait: what if two roads separate the two points, but they are not crossed independently? Actually, the problem is analogous to the following: each road is a constraint. The home and university are two points. The roads that separate them must be crossed. And since we can only cross one road per step, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n However, consider: the example input 1:\n\n Input: \n  1 1\n  -1 -1\n  2\n  0 1 0   -> y = 0 (the x-axis)\n  1 0 0   -> x = 0 (the y-axis)\n\n Home (1,1) and University (-1,-1): \n  Road1 (y=0): 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a road (an infinite line) that separates two adjacent blocks. The key insight is recognizing that each road that separates the home and university points must be crossed exactly once, and the minimal number of steps is simply the count of such separating roads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The roads divide the plane into multiple blocks. The home and university are located in two distinct blocks. Each road is a linear equation, and the points lie on one side of each road. A road separates the two points if they lie on opposite sides of it.\n2. **Intuition**: For each road, check whether the home and university points are on the same side or opposite sides. If they are on opposite sides, this road must be crossed at least once. The minimal number of steps is the total number of such roads that separate the two points.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, compute the sign of the equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) for both points. If the signs differ, the road separates the two points and must be counted.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the \\(n\\) roads once, performing constant-time checks for each. Thus, the time complexity is \\(O(n)\\), which is efficient given the constraint \\(n \\leq 300\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    n = int(data[4])\n    \n    index = 5\n    count = 0\n    \n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        \n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        \n        if (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0) or (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0):\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first four values are the coordinates of the home and university. The next value is the number of roads, followed by the coefficients of each road's equation.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the code checks the sign of the equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) when evaluated at both the home and university points. If the signs differ, the road separates the two points, and the step count is incremented.\n3. **Output Result**: The total count of such separating roads is printed, representing the minimal number of steps needed to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages geometric properties of lines and points to determine the solution with optimal performance.",
