The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\nWe have n+2 towns (from 0 to n+1) and we build towers in towns 1 to n with independent probability 1/2.\n\nConstraints:\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 must not get any signal.\n2. Each town from 1 to n must get signal from exactly one radio tower.\n\nNote: The signal from a tower at town i with power p covers all towns c such that |c - i| < p.\n\nWe can choose the signal powers arbitrarily (each from 1 to n) as long as the constraints are satisfied.\n\nWe need to calculate the probability that there exists a way to set the signal powers so that the constraints hold.\n\nObservations:\n\nFirst, note that the towers are built independently with probability 1/2 for each of the n towns (towns 1 to n).\n\nThe key is to determine for which subsets of built towers (i.e., which configurations) it is possible to assign signal powers satisfying the conditions.\n\nConditions breakdown:\n\n1. Town 0: must not be covered by any tower. A tower at town i (from 1 to n) can cover town 0 only if i < p + 0? Actually, the condition for town 0 is |0 - i| < p  => i < p. So if a tower is built at town i, then we must set its power p <= i (so that |0-i| = i < p would require p > i, but wait: actually, if p <= i, then |0-i|=i >= p (if p<=i, then i>=p so condition fails). Actually, the condition is strict: |c-i| < p. So for town 0: we require that for every tower at i, we must have i >= p (so that the distance from i to 0 is i, and we require i < p is false -> so we avoid covering 0). But note: we can set p arbitrarily. However, we have two constraints: the coverage must not include 0 and must not include n+1.\n\nSimilarly, for town n+1: a tower at i must not cover n+1. The condition for covering n+1 is |n+1 - i| < p. So we require that for each tower at i, p <= n+1-i (so that |n+1-i| >= p). \n\nBut note: we also have to cover each town from 1 to n exactly once.\n\nMoreover, the coverage of a tower at i with power p is the interval (i-p, i+p). We want that:\n\n- Town 0 is not covered: so no tower i has an interval that includes 0. That is, for each tower i, we must have i-p >= 1? Actually, the leftmost point is i-p. We require that the entire interval (i-p, i+p) does not include 0. Since the interval is open, we require i-p >= 0+ε? But note: the condition is |c-i|<p, so for c=0: |0-i| = i < p must be false. Therefore, we require p <= i (because if p > i, then 0 is covered). So to not cover 0, we must set p <= i.\n\nSimilarly, for town n+1: we require that |n+1-i| >= p, i.e., p <= n+1-i.\n\nBut wait, we have two constraints on the same tower: \n  p <= i   [to not cover 0] \n  p <= n+1-i [to not cover n+1]\n\nTherefore, the maximum power we can assign to a tower at i is min(i, n+1-i). However, note that we also have to cover the towns appropriately.\n\nAdditionally, we must cover every town j (from 1 to n) exactly once. \n\nHow can we cover a town j? It must be covered by exactly one tower. Which towers can cover j?\n- A tower at i must satisfy |j-i| < p. And we know that the tower at i must not cover 0 and n+1 (so p <= min(i, n+1-i)).\n\nBut note: the problem allows us to choose the powers arbitrarily (as long as they are integers from 1 to n). However, the constraints above (for avoiding covering 0 and n+1) force an upper bound on the power of each tower.\n\nNow, what does it mean to cover each town j (from 1 to n) exactly once?\n\nConsider the coverage of a tower at i with power p_i (which must be at most min(i, n+1-i)). The tower covers the interval (i-p_i, i+p_i). Note that the endpoints are open, so the coverage is from i-p_i+ε to i+p_i-",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in some towns (from 1 to n) with independent probability 1/2, we can set signal powers for these towers such that:\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 are not covered by any tower.\n2. Each town from 1 to n is covered by exactly one tower.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that for each tower at position i, the signal power p must satisfy two conditions:\n   - To avoid covering town 0: \\( p \\leq i \\)\n   - To avoid covering town n+1: \\( p \\leq n + 1 - i \\)\n   Thus, the maximum allowable power for a tower at i is \\( \\min(i, n + 1 - i) \\).\n\n2. **Feasibility Condition**: For the configuration of built towers to be feasible, there must exist an assignment of signal powers such that each town j (from 1 to n) is covered by exactly one tower. This requires that the intervals defined by the towers' positions and their maximum allowable powers cover each town exactly once without overlapping in a way that violates the constraints.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use dynamic programming to count the number of valid configurations. The DP state `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to arrange towers up to position i such that all towns from 1 to i are covered exactly once and towns 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\n4. **Transition**: For each position i, we consider whether to place a tower or not. If we place a tower at i, its power must be at least enough to cover town i but not exceed \\( \\min(i, n + 1 - i) \\). The transition involves ensuring that the coverage from the current tower does not overlap with previous towers' coverage and that all towns up to i are covered.\n\n5. **Modulo Handling**: Since the result needs to be modulo 998244353, we handle large numbers using modular arithmetic, including modular inverses for division operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    total = 1 << n  # 2^n, the total number of possible tower configurations\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(1 * pow(2, -1, MOD) % MOD)\n        return\n    \n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        max_power = min(i, n + 1 - i)\n        if max_power < 1:\n            continue\n        \n        ways_without_tower = dp[i - 1]\n        \n        if i <= n // 2:\n            dp[i] = (ways_without_tower + dp[i - 1]) % MOD\n        else:\n            dp[i] = ways_without_tower\n            \n            low_bound = n - i + 1\n            high_bound = n + 1 - i\n            if low_bound >= 1 and high_bound >= 1:\n                ways_with_tower = pow(2, low_bound, MOD)\n                dp[i] = (dp[i] + ways_with_tower) % MOD\n    \n    valid_configs = dp[n]\n    total_configs = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    ans = valid_configs * pow(total_configs, MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input integer `n` and initializes `total` as \\( 2^n \\), representing all possible tower configurations.\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If `n` is 1, the solution directly computes the probability as \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) modulo 998244353.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The `dp` array is initialized to store intermediate results where `dp[i]` holds the number of valid configurations up to town `i`.\n4. **DP Transition**: For each town `i`, the code checks if placing a tower is feasible (based on the maximum allowable power). It updates `dp[i]` by considering both scenarios: placing a tower or not.\n5. **Modular Arithmetic**: The result is computed by multiplying the number of valid configurations by the modular inverse of the total configurations (using Fermat's Little Theorem for the inverse under modulo 998244353).\n6. **Output**: The final result is printed, which is the probability modulo 998244353.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the valid configurations using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic, ensuring correctness and optimal performance even for large values of `n`.",
