Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and a string A of 2n digits.\n We have two players: Homer (H) and Marge (M). Each makes exactly n moves.\n On each move, the leftmost digit is taken and appended to the respective player's number.\n\n The goal is to choose a sequence of moves (a string of length 2n containing n 'H's and n 'M's) such that the total prize (which is the value of S1 plus the value of S2) is maximized.\n\n Note: The total prize is just the numerical value of S1 plus the numerical value of S2. However, note that S1 and S2 are built from the digits in order, but the assignment of digits to H or M is determined by the sequence.\n\n Observation:\n Since the entire string A is fixed, we know the order of the digits. The catch is that we can assign each digit to either H or M arbitrarily, as long as each gets exactly n digits (and the assignment is done from left to right: the first time a player is chosen, they get the next digit, then the next, etc.)\n\n But note: The problem does not require to output the actual numbers, but the sequence of moves (a string of 'H' and 'M').\n\n How to think?\n The total prize is the sum of two numbers. Let the digits be d0, d1, ..., d_{2n-1}. In the sequence of moves, we assign each digit to one of the two players. Then, the number for Homer is formed by taking the digits assigned to H in the order of appearance, and similarly for Marge.\n\n However, note that the digits are taken from the leftmost of A. So the assignment must be such that the digits are taken in the original order.\n\n Let the assignment be represented by a string s of length 2n, with exactly n 'H's and n 'M's. Then, the number for Homer is the concatenation of the digits at positions i where s[i]=='H'. Similarly for Marge.\n\n But note: The digits are taken from A in order. Actually, the digit at position 0 is the first one, then 1, then 2, etc. And when we assign a move to a player, we take the current leftmost (which is the next digit in the array) and append it to that player's number.\n\n Therefore, the sequence of moves directly tells us which digit goes to which player. For example, if the sequence is \"HHMM\", then:\n   First move (digit0): H -> S1 = d0\n   Second move (digit1): H -> S1 = d0 + d1 (as a two-digit number)\n   Third move (digit2): M -> S2 = d2\n   Fourth move (digit3): M -> S2 = d2 + d3\n\n The value of S1 is the integer formed by the digits assigned to H in the order they appear (from the beginning). Similarly for S2.\n\n However, note: the digits are taken from the entire string A, so the set of digits for H is the ones at the indices where the move is 'H', and similarly for M.\n\n Therefore, the total prize is:\n   S1 = d_i0 * 10^{k0} + d_i1 * 10^{k1} + ... \n   but wait, actually the digits are appended in the order of the original string. However, the length of the number for a player is n (because they make n moves). But note: the first digit assigned to H will be the most significant.\n\n Example: n=2, A=\"1234\", and sequence \"HHMM\":\n   H gets the digits at index0 and index1: so S1 = 1*10 + 2 = 12.\n   M gets the digits at index2 and index3: so S2 = 3*10 + 4 = 34.\n   Total prize = 12 + 34 = 46.\n\n But consider sequence \"HM HM\": \n   H: d0, then M: d1, then H: d2, then M: d3.\n   S1 = d0*10 + d2 = 1*10 + 3 = 13.\n   S2 = d1*10 + d3 = 2*10 + 4 = 24.\n   Total prize = 13+24=37.\n\n How do we maximize the total prize?\n\n We can note that the total prize is the sum of two numbers, each of n digits. The entire set of digits is fixed, and we are assigning each digit to one of the two numbers. However, the assignment also matters because the digits are appended in the order they appear. \n\n Let's denote:\n   Let X be the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for two players, Homer and Marge, such that the sum of their resulting numbers is maximized. The sequence consists of exactly 2n characters, with each player making n moves. Each move involves taking the leftmost digit of the remaining number and appending it to the respective player's number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the total prize is the sum of two numbers formed by interleaving the digits of the given 2n-digit number A. The challenge is to assign each digit to either Homer or Marge in such a way that the sum of their numbers is maximized.\n2. **Insight**: The optimal strategy involves ensuring that both players' numbers are as large as possible. This can be achieved by assigning higher digits to the more significant positions (i.e., earlier in the sequence) for both players. However, since the assignment must alternate between players (each player makes exactly n moves), we need to balance the digits between them.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use dynamic programming to explore all possible ways to split the digits into two sequences (for Homer and Marge) while keeping track of the best possible sums. The DP state `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum sum achievable after processing the first `i+j` digits, where Homer has taken `i` digits and Marge has taken `j` digits. The transition involves deciding whether the next digit should go to Homer or Marge.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each digit once, leading to a time complexity of O((2n)^2), which is feasible since n is at most 18 (so 2n ≤ 36).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n_line = int(data[0].strip())\n    A = data[1].strip()\n    total_digits = 2 * n_line\n    \n    dp = [[-1] * (n_line + 1) for _ in range(n_line + 1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 0\n    seq = [''] * total_digits\n\n    for i in range(total_digits):\n        digit_char = A[i]\n        d_val = int(digit_char)\n        for h_count in range(n_line + 1):\n            for m_count in range(n_line + 1):\n                if dp[h_count][m_count] == -1:\n                    continue\n                new_dp = dp[h_count][m_count]\n                if h_count < n_line:\n                    candidate = dp[h_count][m_count] + d_val * (10 ** (n_line - h_count - 1))\n                    if dp[h_count + 1][m_count] == -1 or candidate > dp[h_count + 1][m_count]:\n                        dp[h_count + 1][m_count] = candidate\n                        seq[i] = 'H'\n                if m_count < n_line:\n                    candidate = dp[h_count][m_count] + d_val * (10 ** (n_line - m_count - 1))\n                    if dp[h_count][m_count + 1] == -1 or candidate > dp[h_count][m_count + 1]:\n                        dp[h_count][m_count + 1] = candidate\n                        seq[i] = 'M'\n\n    result_seq = ''.join(seq)\n    print(result_seq)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The input is read, and variables are initialized. The DP table `dp` is set up with dimensions `(n+1) x (n+1)` to keep track of the maximum sum achievable for different counts of digits assigned to each player.\n2. **DP Table Population**: For each digit in the input number A, the algorithm checks all possible states (counts of digits assigned to each player) and updates the DP table by considering whether adding the current digit to Homer's or Marge's number yields a higher sum.\n3. **Sequence Construction**: The sequence of moves (comprising 'H' and 'M') is constructed based on the decisions made during the DP table population. The sequence ensures that both players end up with numbers whose sum is maximized.\n4. **Output**: The resulting sequence is printed, which dictates the order in which digits are assigned to Homer and Marge to achieve the maximum total prize.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible digit assignments using dynamic programming, ensuring optimality while adhering to the constraints.",
