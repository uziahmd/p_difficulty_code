Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, and then n lines of n characters each.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. All the letters on both diagonals must be the same (but note: there might be two different letters? Actually, the problem says: on both diagonals the same letter. However, note that the center is common to both diagonals. So both diagonals must have the same letter? Actually, the example: \n    Input: 3\n            wsw\n            sws\n            wsw\n    This is 'YES'. In this example, the diagonals are:\n        Main diagonal: w, s, w -> but wait, the condition says \"on both diagonals all letters are the same\". However, in the main diagonal we have 'w', 's', 'w' which is not the same. But wait, the example output is 'YES'.\n\n Let me reread the problem statement: \n    \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n But note: the example input 3:\n        wsw\n        sws\n        wsw\n\n The diagonals are:\n    Main diagonal: [0][0] = 'w', [1][1] = 's', [2][2] = 'w' -> not the same.\n\n However, the example output is 'YES'. \n\n Let me check the example again: the problem states that the other squares (not on the diagonals) must contain the same letter that is different from the diagonal ones.\n\n Wait, in the example, the diagonals are not all the same. But note: the example is:\n\n        w s w\n        s s s   -> wait, no, the input is: \n        w s w\n\n        s w s\n        s s s   -> Actually, the input is:\n\n        Line1: 'wsw'\n        Line2: 'sws'\n        Line3: 'wsw'\n\n So the grid is:\n     0: ['w','s','w']\n     1: ['s','w','s']   -> wait, the example input was: \n        Input: \n          3\n          wsw\n          sws\n          wsw\n\n So the grid is:\n     0: ['w','s','w']\n     1: ['s','w','s']   -> but wait, the example output is YES.\n\n However, according to the problem statement: \n      \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n In the main diagonal: \n     (0,0): 'w', (1,1): 'w', (2,2): 'w' -> no, wait: \n     Actually, the grid is:\n\n        row0: index0: 'w', index1: 's', index2: 'w'\n        row1: index0: 's', index1: 'w', index2: 's'\n        row2: index0: 'w', index1: 's', index2: 'w'\n\n Then the main diagonal: \n        (0,0): 'w'\n        (1,1): 'w'\n        (2,2): 'w'\n\n The anti-diagonal: \n        (0,2): 'w'\n        (1,1): 'w'\n        (2,0): 'w'\n\n So both diagonals are all 'w'. \n\n But wait, the example input was written as:\n        ['3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw']\n\n And the second line is \"sws\", meaning:\n        row0: 'w','s','w'\n        row1: 's','w','s'\n        row2: 'w','s','w'\n\n However, note: the example input provided in the example is:\n\n        Input: \n          3\n          wsw\n          sws\n          wsw\n\n That means the second row is 'sws', so the grid is:\n\n        ['w','s','w']\n        ['s','w','s']\n        ['w','s','w']\n\n Now the main diagonal: \n        (0,0): 'w'\n        (1,1): 'w'\n        (2,2): 'w'\n\n Anti-diagonal:\n        (0,2): 'w'\n        (1,1): 'w'\n        (2,0): 'w'\n\n So indeed, both diagonals are all 'w'. \n\n But wait, what about the rest of the cells?\n        The non-diagonal cells should be the same letter and different from the diagonal one.\n\n Non-diagonal cells: \n        (0,1): 's'\n        (1,0): 's'\n        (1,2): 's'\n        (2,1): 's'\n\n They are all 's', which is different from 'w'. \n\n Therefore, the condition holds.\n\n However, note: the example input",

All elements must be the same letter.\n3. **Checking Anti-Diagonal**: Similarly, it checks elements where the sum of row and column indices equals `n-1` (anti-diagonal). All elements here must also be the same letter and match the main diagonal's letter.\n4. **Checking Non-Diagonal Elements**: It verifies that all other elements in the grid are identical and different from the diagonal letters.\n5. **Output Result**: If all conditions are satisfied, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to determine if the grid forms an \"X\" as specified.",
