She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n We need to leave only the tabs from l to r. Initially, all tabs from 1 to n are open.\n\n There are two types of operations:\n  1. Move the cursor: either left (to max(current - 1, a)) or right (to min(current + 1, b)), where a and b are the current minimum and maximum tab indices (which change as we close tabs).\n  2. Close all tabs to the left (so that the new a becomes i) or to the right (so that the new b becomes i).\n\n However, note that after closing some tabs, the boundaries a and b change.\n\n But note: we are allowed to close only when the cursor is at a certain tab. And then the boundaries update.\n\n The goal is to minimize the seconds (each move or close operation takes 1 second).\n\n Observation:\n We can consider two independent parts: closing the left part (tabs < l) and the right part (tabs > r). However, the order of operations and the initial position matter.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If the entire range [1, n] is already [l, r] (i.e., l==1 and r==n), then we don't need to do anything.\n\n 2. Otherwise, we need to close tabs to the left (if any) and to the right (if any). But note: we might be able to do both in one continuous process.\n\n However, note that we start at `pos`. We can plan:\n\n Option A: First move the cursor to the left boundary (which is l) and then close the right side? Or vice versa?\n\n Actually, we have two boundaries to set: the left boundary should become l, and the right boundary should become r.\n\n But note: we cannot close a part that doesn't include the cursor's current tab. So to close the left part (tabs < l), we must have the cursor at least at l (so that the segment [a, i-1] includes [1, l-1]). Similarly, to close the right part (tabs > r), we must have the cursor at most at r.\n\n However, note the operations: \n   - Closing left: requires that the cursor is at i, then we close [a, i-1]. After closing, the new a becomes i (so the leftmost tab is i). Similarly, closing right: [i+1, b] is closed, then the new b becomes i.\n\n Therefore, to close the left part (all tabs < l) we must have the cursor at l (because then we can close [a, l-1] and set a = l). Similarly, to close the right part (all tabs > r) we must have the cursor at r.\n\n But wait: what if we don't go exactly to l? Consider: if we are at a tab greater than l, we can close the left part from that tab? Let me check: \n   Operation: Close all tabs to the left of the cursor. Then the left boundary becomes the cursor's current position. So if we are at x (x>=l) then after closing left, the left boundary becomes x. We want it to be l. So if we are at x (x>l) then after closing, the left boundary is x (which is not l). Then we would have to move again to close the remaining left part? \n\n However, note: we are allowed to close multiple times. But the problem is asking for the minimum seconds.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the process as:\n\n  Step 1: Move the cursor to the desired closing positions (from which we can close the left and right).\n\n But note: we can also do:\n\n  - Close the left part from a position that is >= l, but then we have to adjust the left boundary to l. However, if we close from a position x (x>=l), then the left boundary becomes x. Then we still need to close the tabs between the old left boundary (which was 1) and x-1, but wait: actually we are closing from the current left boundary (which is initially 1) to x-1. Then we set the left boundary to x. Then we have to close the tabs from 1 to x-1 (but we did that) so that leaves [x, ...] and then we have to close the right part.\n\n However, if we want the left boundary to be l, then we must eventually have the cursor at l (or above) and then close the left part, but if we are at a position x (x>l) then after closing the left part, the left boundary becomes x (which is greater than l). Then we have an extra problem: we have to close the tabs from 1 to x-1, but we only closed from 1 to x-1,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds required for Luba to close all tabs outside the specified segment [l, r] while starting from a given position `pos`. The solution involves analyzing the initial and target segments and calculating the optimal sequence of operations (moving the cursor or closing tabs) to achieve the desired result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that Luba needs to ensure that only the tabs within [l, r] remain open. This requires closing all tabs to the left of `l` and all tabs to the right of `r`. The challenge is to find the most efficient sequence of moves and closures starting from the initial cursor position `pos`.\n\n2. **Insight**: The solution can be broken down into two main scenarios:\n   - **No Operations Needed**: If the entire range [1, n] is already within [l, r], no actions are required.\n   - **Closing Left or Right Segments**: If the left segment (tabs < l) or the right segment (tabs > r) needs to be closed, we consider the initial position relative to `l` and `r`:\n     - If `pos` is already at `l`, closing the left segment takes 1 second.\n     - Similarly, if `pos` is at `r`, closing the right segment takes 1 second.\n     - If `pos` is between `l` and `r`, moving the cursor to either `l` or `r` and then closing the respective segment might be necessary.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm checks for the simplest cases first (no operations needed) and then calculates the minimal steps required by considering the closest boundaries (`l` and `r`) to the initial position `pos`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    pos = int(data[1])\n    l_val = int(data[2])\n    r_val = int(data[3])\n\n    if l_val == 1 and r_val == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    if pos <= l_val:\n        print(abs(pos - l_val) + 1)\n        return\n\n    if pos >= r_val:\n        print(abs(pos - r_val) + 1)\n        return\n\n    left_distance = abs(pos - l_val)\n    right_distance = abs(pos - r_val)\n\n    if left_distance < right_distance:\n        print(left_distance + 1)\n    else:\n        print(right_distance + 1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: The code first checks if the entire range [1, n] is already within [l, r]. If so, it prints `0` since no operations are needed.\n2. **Cursor Position Handling**: \n   - If the cursor is to the left of `l`, it calculates the distance to move to `l` and adds 1 second for the closure operation.\n   - Similarly, if the cursor is to the right of `r`, it calculates the distance to move to `r` and adds 1 second for the closure operation.\n3. **Optimal Path Calculation**: If the cursor is between `l` and `r`, the code determines the closer boundary (`l` or `r`) and calculates the minimal steps required to reach that boundary and perform the closure operation. The result is the sum of the movement steps and the closure operation step.\n\nThis approach efficiently minimizes the number of operations by leveraging the initial cursor position and the closest relevant boundaries, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
