The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to use the condition: a_i + b_j is odd => (a_i % 2) != (b_j % 2)\n Therefore, we can separate the chests and keys by their parity.\n\n Let:\n   Chestes_even = number of chests with a_i even\n   Chestes_odd = number of chests with a_i odd\n\n   Keys_even = number of keys with b_j even\n   Keys_odd = number of keys with b_j odd\n\n Now, note that an even chest can only be opened by an odd key, and an odd chest can only be opened by an even key.\n\n So, we have two bipartite graphs (or two independent matching problems):\n\n 1. Even keys -> Odd chests: \n    But wait, actually: \n        - Even chest requires odd key.\n        - Odd chest requires even key.\n\n However, note the condition: \n        a_i (chest) + b_j (key) is odd.\n\n This means:\n        If a_i is even, then b_j must be odd (since even + odd = odd).\n        If a_i is odd, then b_j must be even (since odd + even = odd).\n\n Therefore, we have two types of pairs:\n\n        Type 1: (even chest, odd key)\n        Type 2: (odd chest, even key)\n\n The problem now reduces to: we have two independent sets of edges (they don't interfere because even keys cannot open even chests and odd keys cannot open odd chests). \n\n But note: one key or chest can be used at most once.\n\n However, we have two separate bipartite matchings? Actually, we can model it as:\n\n        We want to assign as many as possible from:\n            - The even chests to the odd keys (each even chest must get an odd key, and each odd key can only be used for one even chest? Actually, no: the same key cannot be used twice, but note that the condition for the two types are independent. However, the same key cannot be used in two different pairs, and same chest cannot be used twice.\n\n Since the two types (even chests and odd keys for type1; odd chests and even keys for type2) do not share any key or chest, we can independently compute the maximum matching for each.\n\n But note: the keys and chests are distinct. However, there's no overlap between the two sets of keys and chests (because even keys are used for odd chests and odd keys for even chests). So the two matchings are independent.\n\n Therefore, the total maximum chests we can open is the sum of:\n\n        Matching1: the maximum matching from even_chests to odd_keys (which is just min(even_chests, odd_keys))\n        Matching2: the maximum matching from odd_chests to even_keys (which is min(odd_chests, even_keys))\n\n However, wait: is that really the case?\n\n Example: \n        Input: \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\"\n\n        Chests: [9,14,6,2,11] -> even: [14,6,2] -> count=3; odd: [9,11] -> count=2\n        Keys: [8,4,7,20] -> even: [8,4,20] -> count=3; odd: [7] -> count=1\n\n        Then according to this, we can open:\n            From even_chests (3) and odd_keys (1): min(3,1)=1\n            From odd_chests (2) and even_keys (3): min(2,3)=2\n            Total = 1+2 = 3 -> which matches the example.\n\n But wait, why is the matching for even_chests and odd_keys exactly the minimum? Because each even chest requires an odd key and they are independent. Similarly for odd_chests and even_keys.\n\n However, note: the keys are shared only within their own set (odd keys for even chests, even keys for odd chests). There is no cross-type sharing.\n\n Therefore, we can simply do:\n\n        ans = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\n Let me test with the second example:\n\n        Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n\n        Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> even_chests=5, odd_chests=0\n        Keys: [5] -> odd -> odd_keys=1, even_keys=0\n\n        Then: min(5,1)=1 and min(0,0)=0 -> total=1 -> correct.\n\n Third example:\n\n        Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n\n        Chest: [10",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This translates to the condition that an even-numbered chest must be opened by an odd-numbered key, and vice versa.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests to keys based on parity (even or odd). The solution involves categorizing both chests and keys into even and odd groups.\n2. **Key Insight**: An even-numbered chest can only be opened by an odd-numbered key, and an odd-numbered chest can only be opened by an even-numbered key. These two scenarios are independent of each other.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each scenario (even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys), the maximum number of possible matches is simply the minimum of the counts of chests and keys in each respective group. Summing these minima gives the total number of chests that can be opened.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach involves counting elements in each category, which takes O(n + m) time, where n is the number of chests and m is the number of keys. This is optimal as we need to process each input element at least once.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n            \n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n            \n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    ans = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective numbers.\n2. **Categorizing Chests and Keys**: We count how many chests and keys are even-numbered. The remaining are odd-numbered.\n3. **Matching Process**: The maximum number of even chests that can be opened is the minimum of the count of even chests and odd keys. Similarly, the maximum number of odd chests that can be opened is the minimum of the count of odd chests and even keys.\n4. **Output Result**: The sum of these two minima gives the total number of chests Neko can open, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the parity condition to maximize the number of chests opened by independently handling each scenario, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
