Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of array elements. The next line contains n space-separated integers a0, a1, ..., an - 1 (0 ≤ ai ≤ 104) — elements of array a.The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m.

Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem.\n\nWe are given:\n1. An integer `n`\n2. A list of `n` integers `a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}`\n3. A string `s` (without spaces) of length `n` which is the binary representation of `m` (with leading zeros if necessary)\n\nNote: The function `f(x)` is defined as:\n   f(x) = sum_{i: bit(i) in x} a_i\n\nBut note: the index i goes from 0 to n-1, and the binary representation of x has n bits? Actually, the problem says that x is an integer from 0 to 2^n-1. However, the representation of m is given as a binary string of length n (which might have leading zeros). So we can consider the numbers from 0 to m (inclusive) and the indices of the array a correspond to the bit positions (from least significant to most significant?).\n\nWait, note the example: \n   n=4, x=11 (binary 1011) -> f(11)=a0+a1+a3.\n\nBut how does the indexing work?\nIn the example, the binary representation of 11 (which is 1011) has:\n   bit0 (LSB): 1 -> included (so index0)\n   bit1: 1 -> included (index1)\n   bit2: 0 -> not included\n   bit3: 1 -> included (index3)\n\nSo the array a has indices from 0 to n-1, and the i-th element a_i corresponds to the i-th bit (with i=0 being the least significant bit).\n\nHowever, note the input for m is given as a binary string s0 s1 ... s_{n-1}. In typical binary representation, the string is written from most significant to least significant. But wait: the problem says \"the sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn-1 — the binary representation of number m\".\n\nBut then, what is the meaning of s0? Is s0 the most significant bit or the least?\n\nLooking at the example: \n   Input: \n        5\n        17 0 10 2 1\n        11010\n\n   Here, n=5, so the binary string is \"11010\", which is 20 + 2^4? Wait, no: \n   m = s0 * 2^(n-1) + s1 * 2^(n-2) + ... + s_{n-1} * 2^0 ?\n\nBut wait, the example says: m = 11 (in the first sample) and the binary string was '10' (for n=2). Then 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 2.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be using the standard little-endian representation? Or big-endian?\n\nLet me clarify with the second sample:\n\n   Input: \n        5\n        17 0 10 2 1\n        11010\n\n   Then m = 1*(2^4) + 1*(2^3) + 0*(2^2) + 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^0) = 16+8+2 = 26.\n\nBut the example says: m=11 (which is 1011 in binary, but wait the example also says: \"the maximum value of function equals f(5)=27\". \n\nWait, in the example: \n   \"In the second sample m = 20 + 21 + 23 = 11\"\n\nActually, wait: the example says \"m=20+2^1+2^3\" but then they write the binary representation as '11010'. That doesn't match.\n\nWait, I think there is confusion in the example explanation.\n\nLet me read the problem statement again:\n\nExample: \n   Input: \n      ['2\\n3 8\\n10', '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010']\n\n   Output: \n      ['3', '27']\n\nFirst test case: n=2, a=[3,8], m='10' (binary) -> m= 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 2.\n\nThen we must consider x from 0 to 2 (inclusive). \n   x=0: bits: 00 -> f(0)=0.\n   x=1: bits: 01 -> f(1)=a0=3.\n   x",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) for all integers \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements \\( a_i \\) where the i-th bit in the binary representation of \\( x \\) is set. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Binary Representation Handling**: The input provides the binary representation of \\( m \\) as a string of length \\( n \\). This string represents \\( m \\) in big-endian format (most significant bit first). We convert this string into a list of integers (0s and 1s) for easier manipulation.\n\n2. **Bitwise Analysis**: For each bit position from the most significant to the least significant, we decide whether setting that bit to 1 in \\( x \\) will not exceed \\( m \\). If setting a bit to 1 does not violate the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\), we include the corresponding \\( a_i \\) in the sum. However, if setting a bit to 1 might require adjusting higher bits, we need to ensure that the remaining bits can still form a valid number without exceeding \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Greedy Selection**: We traverse the bits from the most significant to the least significant. For each bit, if setting it to 1 does not make \\( x \\) exceed \\( m \\) when combined with the higher bits already set, we include \\( a_i \\) in the sum. Otherwise, we consider the possibility of setting lower bits to 1 while ensuring the overall number remains within bounds.\n\n4. **Dynamic Adjustment**: After processing each bit, we adjust the current value of \\( x \\) by subtracting the contribution of the processed bits if they are set, ensuring subsequent checks remain accurate.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    bin_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    m_bin = [int(char) for char in bin_str]\n    \n    total_bits = len(m_bin)\n    ans = 0\n    cur_val = 0\n    \n    for i in range(total_bits - 1, -1, -1):\n        bit_val = 1 << i\n        current_bit = m_bin[i]\n        \n        if current_bit == 1:\n            if a_list[i] >= 0:\n                ans += a_list[i]\n                cur_val += bit_val\n            else:\n                ans -= a_list[i]\n        else:\n            if a_list[i] < 0:\n                if cur_val < bit_val:\n                    ans += a_list[i]\n                    cur_val += bit_val\n                else:\n                    pass\n            else:\n                pass\n\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three parts: the number of elements \\( n \\), the list of integers \\( a \\), and the binary string representation of \\( m \\).\n\n2. **Binary Conversion**: The binary string is converted into a list of integers for easier manipulation during traversal.\n\n3. **Traversal and Bit Processing**: The algorithm processes each bit from the most significant to the least significant. For each bit, it checks if setting it to 1 in \\( x \\) would keep \\( x \\) within the bound \\( m \\). \n\n4. **Decision Making**: If the current bit in \\( m \\) is 1, the corresponding \\( a_i \\) is added to the answer if it is non-negative. If the bit is 0 and \\( a_i \\) is negative, setting this bit might allow including more negative values later, so it is conditionally included only if the current value of \\( x \\) allows it.\n\n5. **Output**: The maximum value of \\( f(x) \\) is printed after processing all bits.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints by leveraging bitwise operations and greedy selection, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
