For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes. The notes are from the set: ['C','C#','D','D#','E','F','F#','G','G#','A','B','H'] (12 notes)\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (0 to 11) representing the semitone index.\n 2. Since the chord is an unordered set, we will consider all permutations of the three notes.\n 3. For each permutation [a, b, c] (which we can think as X, Y, Z), check two conditions:\n    Condition for major: \n        distance from a to b = 4 semitones, and from b to c = 3 semitones.\n    Condition for minor:\n        distance from a to b = 3 semitones, and from b to c = 4 semitones.\n\n However, note: the problem says the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the highest one. But in our circular system, we need to compute the shortest way? \n But note: the example: between E and C is 8 semitones (if we go up from E to C, we wrap around). However, the definition says: the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one.\n\n Important: In the example, the chord \"C E G\": \n    C to E: 4 semitones (because E is 4 above C: C->C#(1), D(2), D#(3), E(4))\n    Then from E to G: 3 semitones (E->F(5th), F#(6th), G(7th) -> wait, but that would be 3 semitones? Actually, E to F is 1, F to F# is 2, F# to G is 3? But wait, the example says 3.\n\n However, note: the example says \"between E and G\" is 3 semitones. But actually, the distance from E to G is 3 semitones if we consider the natural sequence without wrapping? \n\n But what if we have a chord that wraps? Example: \"A B H\" (from the example input). \n    The example says it's 'strange'. Let's map:\n        A: 9, B: 10, H: 11 (if we use the mapping: C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, B=10, H=11)\n\n    Now, we have to check the distances. We must consider the circular nature: the distance from A to B is 1 (10-9=1) but also the other way? But the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\".\n\n    However, the example input \"A B H\" is given. We have to order the three notes in increasing order (lowest to highest) and then check the intervals?\n\n    But wait: the problem does not specify the ordering. It says \"If we can order the notes so as the distance ...\". So we have to consider the cyclic order.\n\n Approach:\n\n Since the musical scale is circular, we can fix a starting point and then consider the next two. But note: the problem says the distance from the lowest to the highest. So we should arrange the three notes in ascending order (with wrap-around) and then take the two intervals.\n\n However, note: the example \"C# B F\": \n    Notes: C#=1, B=10, F=5.\n    To order them: We can do modulo 12. We have to arrange the three numbers in a circle.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n Step 1: Map the notes to numbers.\n\n Step 2: Since the circle has 12 notes, we can represent the three notes as three points on a circle. We can then consider the three possible orderings (each starting point) and then check the intervals.\n\n But note: the chord is defined by having two intervals: 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). However, the entire span from the first to the last must be 7 semitones (because 4+3=7). But wait, in a circle, we might have two possibilities: the chord could be ascending without wrap, or with wrap.\n\n However, the problem says: the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one. This implies we break the circle at the lowest note and then measure upwards. But note: the example \"C# B F\": \n    The example says they are ordered as \"B C# F\", meaning we start at B (which is the lowest) then go to C# (which",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for a major or minor chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Mapping**: Convert each note into a numerical value (0 to 11) based on its position in the chromatic scale. For example, 'C' is 0, 'C#' is 1, up to 'H' which is 11.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For any two notes, the distance is calculated by finding the difference between their numerical values. Since the musical scale is cyclic, we consider the smallest interval between two notes, either clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n3. **Chord Classification**: Check all permutations of the three notes to see if they can be ordered such that the first two notes are 4 semitones apart (for a major chord) and the next two are 3 semitones apart, or vice versa for a minor chord. If no such ordering exists, the chord is classified as \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    note_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes)}\n\n    data = input().split()\n    a, b, c = data\n\n    try:\n        x1 = note_to_index[a]\n        x2 = note_to_index[b]\n        x3 = note_to_index[c]\n    except KeyError:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n\n    indices = [x1, x2, x3]\n\n    def get_distance(i, j):\n        d = (j - i) % 12\n        return d if d <= 6 else 12 - d\n\n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n\n    for perm in [(0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (1, 2, 0), (2, 0, 1), (2, 1, 0)]:\n        i, j, k = perm\n        dist1 = get_distance(indices[i], indices[j])\n        dist2 = get_distance(indices[j], indices[k])\n        dist3 = get_distance(indices[i], indices[k])\n\n        if dist1 == 4 and dist2 == 3 and dist3 == 7:\n            found_major = True\n        if dist1 == 3 and dist2 == 4 and dist3 == 7:\n            found_minor = True\n\n    if found_major and not found_minor:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor and not found_major:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The code starts by creating a dictionary (`note_to_index`) that maps each note to its corresponding index (0 to 11) in the chromatic scale.\n2. **Input Handling**: The input consists of three space-separated notes. These notes are converted into their respective indices using the dictionary.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The function `get_distance` calculates the shortest distance between two notes on the circular scale. This is done by taking the modulus of the difference between the indices with 12 and adjusting for the smaller interval.\n4. **Chord Classification**: The code checks all six permutations of the three notes to determine if they can be ordered into a major or minor chord. For each permutation, it checks if the distances between consecutive notes match the required intervals (4 and 3 semitones for major, 3 and 4 for minor).\n5. **Output**: Based on the checks, the code prints \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" if none of the permutations meet the criteria for a major or minor chord.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible orderings of the three notes to classify the chord accurately, leveraging the cyclic nature of the musical scale.",
