Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from standard input.\n The idea is:\n 1. Combine the first two strings (guest name and host name) and count the total frequency of each letter.\n 2. Compare the total frequency with the frequency of letters in the third string (the pile).\n 3. If the frequencies match exactly, then we output \"YES\", otherwise \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the problem says the pile should be able to form the two names without any extra or missing letters.\n\n Steps:\n - Read the three lines.\n - Concatenate the first two lines (strip newline characters if present) to form a string that should be built by the pile.\n - Count the frequency of each character in the concatenated string and in the third string (the pile).\n - Check if the counts for every letter in the concatenated string are less than or equal to the counts in the pile, and also the total number of letters must be the same.\n\n But note: the problem says \"there are no extra letters\" meaning the pile must have exactly the same multiset of letters as the two names combined.\n\n Implementation:\n Let s1 = guest's name, s2 = host's name, s3 = pile.\n\n We can do:\n   total_letters = s1 + s2\n   if len(total_letters) != len(s3): then NO.\n\n Alternatively, we can compare sorted(total_letters) == sorted(s3)? \n But note: the length condition is necessary, but what if the lengths are the same but letters don't match? Then we can use sorted.\n\n However, the problem constraints are small (each line <=100), so sorting two strings of at most 200 characters is efficient.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a frequency dictionary for total_letters and for s3.\n\n Example:\n\n Input example 1:\n   Guest: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n   Host: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n   Pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n total_letters = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n Then check if sorted(total_letters) == sorted(\"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\")\n\n But wait, let me check: \n   \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" has 14+9 = 23 letters.\n   \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" has 16 letters? Actually, the example input provided was:\n\n   ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n Actually, the example input is given as a list of three strings, but the sample input in the problem is:\n\n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   So the first two lines are the guest and host, and the third is the pile.\n\n   But note: the example output is \"YES\".\n\n   Let me break down the example:\n\n   Guest: \"SANTACLAUS\" -> 10 letters\n   Host: \"DEDMOROZ\" -> 8 letters, so total 18 letters.\n\n   The pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" -> let's count: \n        S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S -> 17 letters? \n\n   Wait, there's a discrepancy: 10+8=18, but the pile has 17.\n\n   Actually, the example input provided in the note is:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n   But wait, the example input is written as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   This is confusing because the problem statement has three examples.\n\n   Actually, the example input format is:\n\n        Example 1: \n            Input: \n                SANTACLAUS\n                DEDMOROZ\n                SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n        But wait, the example output is YES.\n\n   Let me count the letters in the example:\n\n        Guest: SANTACLAUS -> S:2, A:2, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1 -> total 8? Wait, no:\n\n        SANTACLAUS: \n            S:2, A:2, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1 -> 2+2+1+1+1+1+1 = 9? Actually:\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking if the frequency of each letter in the combined names matches the frequency of each letter in the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Combine the Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string. This string represents all the letters that should be present in the pile.\n2. **Check Lengths**: If the length of the combined string does not match the length of the pile, immediately return \"NO\" since there must be either extra or missing letters.\n3. **Frequency Comparison**: For each letter in the combined string, ensure that its count in the pile is at least as much as its count in the combined string. Additionally, any extra letters in the pile must not exist in the combined string. If both conditions are satisfied, return \"YES\"; otherwise, return \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s1 = input().strip()\n    s2 = input().strip()\n    s3 = input().strip()\n    \n    total_letters = s1 + s2\n    if len(total_letters) != len(s3):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    freq_total = {}\n    for char in total_letters:\n        freq_total[char] = freq_total.get(char, 0) + 1\n        \n    freq_pile = {}\n    for char in s3:\n        freq_pile[char] = freq_pile.get(char, 0) + 1\n        \n    for char in freq_total:\n        if freq_total[char] > freq_pile.get(char, 0):\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n    for char in freq_pile:\n        if char not in freq_total:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n    print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads three strings: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's and host's names are concatenated into a single string (`total_letters`), which should be formed by rearranging the letters in the pile.\n3. **Length Check**: If the combined length of the guest's and host's names does not match the length of the pile, the answer is \"NO\" because there are either extra or missing letters.\n4. **Frequency Calculation**: The code calculates the frequency of each letter in the combined names and the pile.\n5. **Frequency Validation**: It checks if every letter in the combined names has sufficient occurrences in the pile. Additionally, it ensures no extra letters are present in the pile. If both conditions are met, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies whether the pile can be rearranged to form the exact names of the guest and host by leveraging frequency counting and simple condition checks.",
