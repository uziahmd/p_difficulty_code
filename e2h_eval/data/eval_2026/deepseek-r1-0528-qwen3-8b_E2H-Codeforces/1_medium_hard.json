    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The problem states that the plate is a rectangle of size w x h (rows x columns).\n We are to add k gilded rings. The first ring goes along the edge, the second 2 cells away, etc.\n\n For the i-th ring (starting at i=1), the ring is drawn on the inner rectangle of size:\n   w' = w - 4*(i-1)\n   h' = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n But note: the ring has width 1 cell, and it is the border of this inner rectangle.\n\n The number of cells in a ring for a rectangle of size a x b (with a>=3, b>=3) is:\n   Perimeter = 2*a + 2*b - 4   (since each corner is counted twice, but we subtract the 4 corners that were double-counted? Actually, the standard way to compute the border is: top row: a, bottom row: a, left and right without the two ends: so a-2 for left and a-2 for right -> total 2*a + 2*(a-2) ? Let me clarify:\n\n Alternatively, think of the border as:\n   Top: a cells\n   Bottom: a cells\n   Left: b - 2 cells (excluding the top and bottom already counted)\n   Right: b - 2 cells\n\n So total = a + a + (b-2) + (b-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n However, note that the inner rectangle for the i-th ring is of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)).\n But wait, the problem says: \"the first one should go along the edge of the plate\", meaning the entire outer border.\n\n However, there is a catch: the condition for k. The input constraint says: \n   k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)\n\n So we don't have to worry about negative or invalid dimensions.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read w, h, k from stdin.\n 2. We'll calculate for i from 1 to k (inclusive) the inner rectangle dimensions and then the number of cells for that ring.\n\n But note: if for some i, the inner rectangle has a dimension less than 3, then we cannot form a ring? However, the constraint on k ensures that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has at least 3x3.\n\n However, let's check: the i-th ring requires:\n   w_i = w - 4*(i-1) >= 3?\n   h_i = h - 4*(i-1) >= 3?\n\n Since k is bounded by floor((min(w, h)+1)/4), then the maximum i (which is k) satisfies:\n   min(w, h) >= 4*(k-1) + 3? Actually, the constraint is k <= floor((min(n, m)+1)/4). Let me verify:\n\n Example: w=3, h=3, then floor((3+1)/4)=floor(4/4)=1, so k=1 is allowed.\n   Then the inner rectangle for the first ring is 3x3. The ring: 2*3+2*3-4 = 6+6-4 = 8.\n\n But wait, for a 3x3, the border is 8 cells (all except the center). So that matches.\n\n Example: 7x9, k=1: \n   w0=7, h0=9 -> 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4 = 28.\n\n Example: 7x9, k=2: \n   First ring: 7x9 -> 28\n   Second ring: inner rectangle: 7-4*(1)=3, 9-4*(1)=5 -> 3x5\n        Perimeter for 3x5: 2*3+2*5-4 = 6+10-4 = 12\n   Total = 28+12 = 40.\n\n However, the example input ['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2'] gives outputs ['8','28','40'].\n\n Therefore, the approach is to sum the perimeters for i=1 to k.\n\n But note: the problem says the first ring is the outer one, then the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge, meaning the next ring is drawn on the rectangle that is 4 units smaller (since we remove one layer from each side: top, bottom, left, right).\n\n Implementation:\n\n total_cells = 0\n for i in range(1, k+1):\n     w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n     h_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n     # Check if w_i and h_i are at least 3? According to the constraint, they will be because k is bounded such that the last ring has at least 3x3.\n     perimeter = 2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4\n     total_cells += perimeter\n\n However, wait: what if the inner rectangle has negative dimensions? But the constraint on k ensures non-negative and actually positive (at least 3x3 for the last one). \n\n But note: the condition is k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). So for k= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4), then the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is:\n   min_dimension = min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) >= 3? \n   Actually, let x = min(w, h). Then k <= (x+1)//4 (integer division). Then for the k-th ring:\n        x_k = x - 4*(k-1) >= x - 4*((x+1)//4 - 1) \n   But note: (x+1)//4 is the floor of (x+1)/4. So k is at most floor((x+1)/4). Then the minimal x_k is when k = floor((x+1)/4):\n        x_k = x - 4*(floor((x+1)/4)-1) \n        Let's take an example: x=3 -> k_max=1 -> x_1=3-0=3 -> valid.\n        x=4 -> k_max=floor((4+1)/4)=1 -> x_1=4 -> valid.\n        x=5 -> floor((5+1)/4)=floor(6/4)=1 -> x_1=5 -> valid.\n        x=6 -> floor((6+1)/4)=floor(7/4)=1 -> x_1=6 -> valid.\n        x=7 -> floor((7+1)/4)=floor(8/4)=2 -> then x_2=7-4*(1)=3 -> valid.\n        x=8 -> floor((8+1)/4)=floor(9/4)=2 -> then x_2=8-4=4 -> valid.\n\n   So indeed, the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is at least 3 (for the smallest dimension) because when k= floor((x+1)/4), then the dimension becomes x - 4*(k-1) >= 3.\n\n However, note: the formula for the perimeter uses both dimensions. But the condition only ensures that the smallest dimension is at least 3. The other dimension might be larger.\n\n But note: the rectangle for the i-th ring is (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)), so the smallest dimension is the minimum between these two. But our k is bounded by the minimum of w and h. So if w and h are different, then the k is bounded by the smaller one.\n\n Example: w=7, h=9, then k<=floor((7+1)/4)=2, which is correct.\n\n Therefore, the code is straightforward.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem says the plate is split into w x h cells. And the rings are drawn from the outer edge inward. The example 3x3 gives 8.\n\n Code:\n\n w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n total = 0\n for i in range(k):\n     # i from 0 to k-1: then the i-th ring (0-indexed) corresponds to the (i+1)-th ring (1-indexed)\n     # The current rectangle for the (i+1)-th ring: \n     w_i = w - 4*i\n     h_i = h - 4*i\n     # The perimeter of the ring for this rectangle is 2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4\n     total += 2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4\n\n But wait, is that correct? In the example for k=2, we did:\n   i=0: w_i=7, h_i=9 -> 2*7+2*9-4 = 28\n   i=1: w_i=3, h_i=5 -> 2*3+2*5-4 = 12, total=40.\n\n Yes, that matches.\n\n However, note: the problem says the first ring is the edge, then the second is 2 cells away. In our loop, i=0 corresponds to the first ring, and i=1 corresponds to the second. The calculation for the second ring uses 4*i (so 4*1=4) which is correct.\n\n But wait, the problem says the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. How many cells do we subtract from the original? \n   Original: [0, w-1] and [0, h-1]\n   First ring: the outer border.\n   Second ring: we move 2 cells in, so we consider the rectangle from index 2 to h-3 (if we think in terms of indices) and similarly for rows. So the inner rectangle is (w-4) x (h-4). \n\n That matches: subtract 4*i for the i-th ring (when i is 0-indexed, then for the 0th ring we subtract 0, for the 1st ring we subtract 4).\n\n So the code is:\n\n Read w, h, k.\n total = 0\n for i in range(k):\n     w_i = w - 4*i\n     h_i = h - 4*i\n     total += 2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4\n\n Print(total)\n\n However, let's test with the examples:\n\n Example 1: \"3 3 1\"\n   w=3, h=3, k=1\n   i=0: w_i=3, h_i=3 -> 2*3+2*3-4 = 6+6-4 = 8 -> correct.\n\n Example 2: \"7 9 1\"\n   i=0: 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4 = 28 -> correct.\n\n Example 3: \"7 9 2\"\n   i=0: 28, i=1: 2*3+2*5-4 = 6+10-4=12, total=40 -> correct.\n\n But wait: what if the ring is drawn on a rectangle that has one dimension becoming too small? Actually, the constraint on k ensures that we don't go below 3 in any dimension. However, what if the rectangle becomes 1x something? Then the formula 2*w_i+2*h_i-4 would be negative? But the constraint ensures that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has at least 3 in the smallest dimension. So we are safe.\n\n However, note: the problem says the ring is drawn on the inner rectangle of size (w-4*(i-1))x(h-4*(i-1)), and we are using i from 0 to k-1, so we subtract 4*i from both w and h.\n\n Since k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4), then for the last ring (i = k-1) we have:\n   w_i = w - 4*(k-1) >= w - 4*( (min(w,h)+1)//4 - 1 )\n   Similarly for h_i.\n\n But note: the constraint uses floor((min(w, h)+1)/4) and k is at most that value. So the minimal dimension after subtracting 4*(k-1) is at least 3.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n Let's run through the example with w=7, h=9, k=2: \n   i=0: 7-0=7, 9-0=9 -> 2*(7+9)-4 = 32-4=28.\n   i=1: 7-4=3, 9-4=5 -> 2*(3+5)-4 = 16-4=12.\n\n Print 28+12=40.\n\n Another example: w=10, h=10, k= floor((10+1)/4)=floor(11/4)=2.\n   i=0: 10x10 -> 2*(10+10)-4 = 40-4=36.\n   i=1: 10-4=6, 10-4=6 -> 2*(6+6)-4=24-4=20. Total=56.\n\n But let me count manually for 10x10 and two rings:\n\n First ring: outer border of 10x10: 36 cells.\n Second ring: inner rectangle of 6x6: the border is 2*(6+6)-4=24-4=20.\n Total: 56.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the entire process as peeling layers. The total number of cells is the sum of the borders of each inner rectangle.\n\n We can also derive a closed form, but the problem doesn't require that.\n\n However, note: the constraints are small (w, h up to 100, k at most 25) so a loop is efficient.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n One more example: w=5, h=5, k= floor((5+1)/4)=1.\n   Only one ring: 2*(5+5)-4=20-4=16.\n\n But wait, the border of a 5x5: \n   Top: 5, bottom:5, left middle: 3, right middle:3 -> 5+5+3+3=16. Correct.\n\n Example: w=4, h=4, k= floor((4+1)/4)=floor(5/4)=1.\n   Then: 2*(4+4)-4=16-4=12.\n\n The border of 4x4: \n   Top:4, bottom:4, left middle:2, right middle:2 -> 4+4+2+2=12. Correct.\n\n But wait, the problem states that w, h>=3. So 4 is allowed.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n total = 0\n for i in range(k):\n     w_i = w - 4*i\n     h_i = h - 4*i\n     total += 2*(w_i + h_i) - 4\n\n print(total)\n\n However, note: the problem says the first ring is the edge, and the second ring is 2 cells away. Our calculation for the second ring subtracts 4 from both w and h. This is because we are moving two cells in from each side (so 2 from the top and 2 from the bottom, same for left and right). That is correct.\n\n But wait, why subtract 4*i? Because for each ring, we remove 2 from the top and 2 from the bottom (so 4 in total for height) and similarly 2 from the left and 2 from the right (so 4 for width). So for i rings, we subtract 4*i from both dimensions.\n\n However, note the indexing: for the first ring (i=0) we subtract 0, for the second (i=1) we subtract 4, which is 4*1.\n\n This matches.\n\n Let me test with k=0? The problem states k>=1, so no need.\n\n We'll assume the input always satisfies the constraints.\n\n Final code.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. The first ring is placed along the edge of the plate, and each subsequent ring is placed 2 cells away from the previous one, moving inward. Each ring has a width of 1 cell, and the task is to compute the total number of cells covered by all the rings up to the k-th ring.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The plate is a rectangle of size w x h. The i-th ring (0-indexed) is drawn on an inner rectangle of size (w - 4*i) x (h - 4*i). The perimeter of this inner rectangle, which represents the number of cells in the i-th ring, is calculated using the formula \\(2 \\times (width + height) - 4\\). This formula accounts for the four corners being counted twice in the simple perimeter calculation.\n2. **Constraints Handling**: The input ensures that the number of rings k is within the bounds where the inner rectangles for all rings have dimensions at least 3x3, preventing any invalid calculations.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves iterating from 0 to k-1, calculating the dimensions of the inner rectangle for each ring, and summing the perimeters of these rectangles. This approach efficiently computes the total number of cells by leveraging the geometric properties of the rectangles formed by each ring.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(k):\n        w_i = w - 4 * i\n        h_i = h - 4 * i\n        if w_i < 3 or h_i < 3:\n            break\n        total += 2 * (w_i + h_i) - 4\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads three integers: w (width), h (height), and k (number of rings).\n2. **Initialization**: A variable `total` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the sum of cells in all rings.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 0 to k-1:\n   - **Calculate Inner Dimensions**: The dimensions of the inner rectangle for the current ring are computed by subtracting 4*i from both width and height (since each ring moves 2 cells inward from each side).\n   - **Check Validity**: If either dimension falls below 3, the loop breaks early as further rings would be invalid (though the constraints ensure this doesn't happen).\n   - **Sum Perimeter**: The perimeter of the current inner rectangle is calculated and added to `total`.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, the total number of cells is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired result by leveraging simple arithmetic and iteration, ensuring correctness within the given problem constraints.",
