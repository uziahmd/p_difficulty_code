For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes. The notes are from the set: ['C','C#','D','D#','E','F','F#','G','G#','A','B','H'] (12 notes)\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (0 to 11) representing its position in the 12-note cycle.\n 2. Since the chord is unordered, we need to consider all permutations of the three notes and check for the two patterns:\n    Pattern for major: [4, 3, 5] semitones? Actually, the definition says: \n        Major: order such that distance from X to Y is 4, and Y to Z is 3 -> total from X to Z is 7.\n        Minor: order such that distance from X to Y is 3, and Y to Z is 4 -> total from X to Z is 7.\n\n  But note: the problem states the entire circle has 12 notes. The distance between two notes can be computed as:\n      Let base = 12 (the cycle). Then the distance from note a to note b can be calculated by:\n          d = (b - a) % 12\n      However, we must also consider that the chord is taken from the lowest to the highest? Actually, the problem says: \n          \"the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\"\n\n  This means: the distance from a lower note to a higher note is (b - a) mod 12, but if negative we add 12? Actually, the example: \n      From E to C: \n          E is at 4, C is at 0. \n          (0 - 4) % 12 = -4 % 12 = 8 (since -4 + 12 = 8). \n\n  So we can define a function to compute the distance from note a to note b (in the direction from a to b, going forward in the circle) as:\n      Let mapping: \n          'C' -> 0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11.\n\n      Then the distance from a to b is (b_value - a_value) % 12, but if negative we adjust by adding 12 and then mod 12? Actually, we want the positive distance in the forward direction.\n\n  Alternatively, we can compute the circular distance from a to b (without wrapping around) by:\n      dist = (b_value - a_value) % 12\n      But if dist is negative, we do: dist %= 12, which gives a value between 0 and 11.\n\n  However, note the example: from E to C: \n      E:4, C:0 -> (0-4)%12 = -4 %12 = 8 (correct).\n\n  But wait, the problem says \"the distance between C and E is 4\" and \"between E and C is 8\", so we are always measuring the forward (minimal?) no, actually the problem says \"from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we are only considering the increasing direction? \n\n  However, the definition for the chord ordering requires an ordering of the three notes. We are allowed to reorder arbitrarily.\n\n  Approach:\n  We have three notes. We can generate all 6 permutations and for each permutation, check:\n      Let the permutation be [a, b, c] (three notes in order).\n      Then we require that the distances from a to b and b to c are 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor), and then the total from a to c is 7 (which is 4+3 or 3+4).\n\n  But note: the entire chord is cyclic. However, the problem says the chord is an unordered set. We are allowed to choose any starting point.\n\n  However, the problem does not specify that the chord must be played in root position. But the definition says: \n      \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\"\n\n  This ordering must be contiguous in the circle? And the entire set of three notes must form an interval of 7 semitones (from X to Z) and then the remaining part of the circle (from Z back to X) would be 5 semitones (because 12-7=5). \n\n  But note: the example \"C E G\": \n      Ordering: C, E, G -> \n          C to E: 4 semitones (from 0 to 4)\n          E to G: 3 semitones (from 4 to 7)\n          Then the entire circle: from G to C: (0-7)%12 = (0-7+12) %12 = 5, which is the remaining.\n\n  However, we don't require the entire circle, just the three notes. But the ordering must be consecutive in the circle? \n\n  Important: the problem says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we are considering the linear ordering of the circle as if it were a line? Actually, no. The circle is cyclic, but the distance from a to b is defined as the minimal positive steps? \n\n  But wait, the example says: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\". That is not minimal (minimal would be 4 going backwards, but they define it as going forward). \n\n  Clarification: the problem defines the distance from a to b as the number of semitones you have to go forward from a to reach b (wrapping around if necessary). However, in the chord definition, the ordering is such that we are going from X to Y to Z without wrapping? Actually, the example \"C E G\" is ordered from C to E to G, and then the next note would be beyond G, but the chord is just three notes.\n\n  How to interpret the chord definition? \n      In music theory, a major triad is built with root, major third (4 semitones above root) and perfect fifth (7 semitones above root). Similarly, minor uses minor third (3 semitones) and perfect fifth (7 semitones).\n\n  But note: the definition doesn't require the root to be the lowest note. However, the problem says \"an unordered set\", but then we can order arbitrarily. \n\n  However, the problem's example \"C# B F\" is minor. They reordered as \"B C# F\": \n      B to C#: 1 semitone? Wait, let's map:\n          B is 10, C# is 1 -> (1-10)%12 = (1-10+12)%12 = 3 -> 3 semitones? \n      Then C# to F: F is 5, so (5-1)%12 = 4 -> 4 semitones.\n\n  So the ordering is by the circle: from B (10) to C# (1) is 3 semitones (because we go from 10->11->0->1: 3 steps). Then from C# (1) to F (5): 5-1 = 4 semitones.\n\n  Therefore, we must consider the circular ordering. We can compute the distances in the circle (forward direction) and then check for the pattern.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  1. Map the input notes to numbers (0-11). Let the three notes be a, b, c (as numbers).\n\n  2. Generate all 6 permutations of [a, b, c].\n\n  3. For each permutation [x, y, z]:\n        d1 = (y - x) % 12   [if negative, modulo will fix]\n        d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n        Then the condition for major: d1 == 4 and d2 == 3.\n        Condition for minor: d1 == 3 and d2 == 4.\n\n  4. But note: the problem says the chord is an unordered set. What if the chord is given in a different order? We are checking all orders.\n\n  However, there is a catch: the entire circle has 12 tones, and the three notes must form a contiguous segment? Actually, no. The definition doesn't say contiguous, but the distances are measured from the current note to the next in the chosen order.\n\n  But wait, the example \"C# B F\": \n        Notes: [1, 10, 5] (C#, B, F)\n\n        We are checking the permutation [B, C#, F]: [10, 1, 5]\n\n        d1 = (1 - 10) % 12 = (1 - 10 + 12) % 12 = 3 -> correct.\n        d2 = (5 - 1) % 12 = 4 -> correct.\n\n        Another permutation: [C#, B, F]: [1, 10, 5]\n            d1 = (10-1)%12 = 9 -> not 3 or 4.\n            d2 = (5-10)%12 = (5-10+12)%12 = 7 -> not 3 or 4.\n\n        So we must check every permutation.\n\n  5. However, note: the problem says the chord is classified by the existence of an ordering. So if at least one ordering satisfies the major condition, then output \"major\", similarly for minor.\n\n  6. But what if both conditions are met in different orderings? The problem states: \"Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous\", meaning no chord is both major and minor.\n\n  7. There's one more possibility: the chord might not fit either. Then output \"strange\".\n\n  However, note: the problem says \"exactly three notes\", and the chord must be a set of three distinct notes (since the mapping is injective). \n\n  But wait: what about duplicates? The input has three space-separated notes. Are they distinct? The problem says \"chord\" (set) so probably distinct. But the problem does not explicitly say. However, the examples are distinct. We assume distinct.\n\n  Implementation:\n\n  Let's create a list of the 12 notes in order (with their numeric values):\n\n      note_to_index = {\n          'C': 0,\n          'C#': 1, \n          'D': 2,\n          'D#': 3,\n          'E': 4,\n          'F': 5,\n          'F#': 6,\n          'G': 7,\n          'G#': 8,\n          'A': 9,\n          'B': 10,\n          'H': 11\n      }\n\n  Then, split the input string and convert each note to its index.\n\n  Example input: \"C E G\" -> [0,4,7]\n\n  Now, we need to check all permutations of [0,4,7]:\n\n      [0,4,7]: \n          d1 = (4-0)%12 = 4\n          d2 = (7-4)%12 = 3 -> major.\n\n      [0,7,4]:\n          d1 = (7-0)%12=7, d2=(4-7)%12= (4-7+12)=9 -> no.\n\n      [4,0,7]:\n          d1=(0-4)%12= (0-4+12)=8, d2=(7-0)=7 -> no.\n\n      [4,7,0]:\n          d1=(7-4)=3, d2=(0-7+12)=5 -> no.\n\n      [7,0,4]:\n          d1=(0-7+12)=5, d2=(4-0)=4 -> no.\n\n      [7,4,0]:\n          d1=(4-7+12)=9, d2=(0-4+12)=8 -> no.\n\n  So only one ordering works.\n\n  Another example: \"C# B F\" -> [1,10,5]\n\n  Check permutations:\n\n      [1,10,5]:\n          d1 = (10-1)=9 -> no.\n      [1,5,10]:\n          d1=(5-1)=4, d2=(10-5)=5 -> no.\n      [10,1,5]:\n          d1=(1-10+12)=3, d2=(5-1)=4 -> minor. -> found minor.\n\n  So we break when we find one.\n\n  However, we must check all because sometimes there might be two different patterns? But the problem says unambiguous.\n\n  Algorithm:\n\n      notes = input().split()\n      n_list = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\n      perms = set(permutations(n_list))   # but we have 3 distinct numbers, so 6 permutations.\n\n      is_major = False\n      is_minor = False\n\n      for p in permutations(n_list):\n          x, y, z = p\n          d1 = (y - x) % 12\n          d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n          if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n              is_major = True\n          if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n              is_minor = True\n\n      if is_major and is_minor:\n          # According to the problem, this should not happen, but still.\n          # But the problem says unambiguous, so we don't expect both to be true.\n          # However, let's just follow: if both are true, then we have to decide? The problem says unambiguous, so we don't need to handle.\n          # But to be safe, we can break after finding one? Actually, we are checking all and setting both flags.\n\n      Then, if is_major: print(\"major\")\n      elif is_minor: print(\"minor\")\n      else: print(\"strange\")\n\n  However, wait: the problem says the chord is an unordered set, but we are using the circle. The definition requires an ordering. \n\n  But note: the example \"C E G\" is major. However, what if we get the same chord in a different inversion?\n\n  Example: \"E G C\" -> [4,7,0]\n\n      Check: \n          [4,7,0]: \n            d1 = (7-4)=3, d2=(0-7+12)=5 -> no.\n          [4,0,7]:\n            d1=(0-4+12)=8, d2=(7-0)=7 -> no.\n          [7,4,0]:\n            d1=(4-7+12)=9, d2=(0-4+12)=8 -> no.\n          [7,0,4]:\n            d1=(0-7+12)=5, d2=(4-0)=4 -> no.\n          [0,4,7]: found major (already found in the first permutation? Actually, no, because we are generating all permutations from the set [4,7,0] which is the same set as [0,4,7]. \n\n  But wait, we are generating all permutations of the same set. The set {0,4,7} is the same as {4,7,0}. \n\n  Actually, our n_list is [0,4,7] for \"C E G\", and we are generating all permutations of [0,4,7] including [0,4,7] and [4,7,0] etc.\n\n  But in the example \"E G C\", we would have n_list = [4,7,0] (same set). Then we generate the same set of permutations.\n\n  So the above code would work for any order of input.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the input is three space-separated notes.\n\n  Let's test with \"E G C\": \n      Input: \"E G C\" -> [4,7,0]\n\n      Then we check the permutation [4,7,0] -> d1= (7-4)=3, d2=(0-7+12)=5 -> not major/minor.\n      Then [4,0,7]: d1=(0-4+12)=8, d2=(7-0)=7 -> no.\n      Then [7,4,0]: d1=(4-7+12)=9, d2=(0-4+12)=8 -> no.\n      Then [7,0,4]: d1=(0-7+12)=5, d2=(4-0)=4 -> no.\n      Then [0,4,7]: d1=(4-0)=4, d2=(7-4)=3 -> major! -> found.\n\n  So it works.\n\n  But wait: in the example \"E G C\", the permutation [0,4,7] is the same as the original \"C E G\" ordering. How did we get 0 from E and G and C? \n\n  Actually, we mapped the input to numbers: \n      \"E G C\" -> ['E','G','C'] -> [4,7,0]\n\n  Then we generate all permutations of [4,7,0] and one of them is [0,4,7]. \n\n  This is because the set is the same: {0,4,7}. The permutation [0,4,7] is one of the six.\n\n  Therefore, we don't need to worry about the input order.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the chord is an unordered set. Our method checks every ordering.\n\n  One more thing: the problem says the distance is measured from the lowest to the uppest. But in our calculation, we are taking the forward (cyclic) distance. \n\n  But the definition says: \"the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\". \n\n  In our method, when we have the permutation [0,4,7] (C, E, G) we compute:\n      C to E: (4-0)%12 = 4 -> matches.\n      E to G: (7-4)%12 = 3 -> matches.\n\n  When we have the permutation [4,7,0] (E, G, C) we compute:\n      E to G: (7-4)=3 -> then G to C: (0-7+12)=5 -> doesn't match, and indeed the definition requires the entire set to be ordered so that the two intervals are 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4). \n\n  But note: the definition says \"an ordering\", so we can choose any ordering. \n\n  However, the example \"E G C\" is not the standard root position, but we are allowed to reorder arbitrarily. The problem does not specify that the root must be the first note. \n\n  But wait: the definition says \"Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\"\n\n  So we are allowed to pick any ordering (any X,Y,Z). \n\n  Therefore, the above method is correct.\n\n  Code:\n\n      import itertools\n\n      note_to_index = {\n          'C': 0,\n          'C#': 1, \n          'D': 2,\n          'D#': 3,\n          'E': 4,\n          'F': 5,\n          'F#': 6,\n          'G': 7,\n          'G#': 8,\n          'A': 9,\n          'B': 10,\n          'H': 11\n      }\n\n      s = input().split()\n      if len(s) != 3:\n          # According to the problem, there are three notes. But just in case.\n          # But the problem says three, so we assume three.\n          pass\n\n      n_list = [note_to_index[note] for note in s]\n\n      # Generate all permutations\n      from itertools import permutations\n      found_major = False\n      found_minor = False\n\n      for p in permutations(n_list):\n          x, y, z = p\n          # Calculate the forward distance from x to y and y to z (in the circle)\n          d1 = (y - x) % 12\n          d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n          # The entire circle from x to z via y: d1+d2 should be 7 mod 12? Actually, d1+d2 = (y-x+z-y) % 12 = (z-x) % 12, which should be 7 for the chord to be a major/minor (since the third and fifth are 7 apart). But note: the condition in the problem is independent: we require two consecutive intervals of 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4) which sum to 7.\n\n          if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n              found_major = True\n          if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n              found_minor = True\n\n      if found_major:\n          print(\"major\")\n      elif found_minor:\n          print(\"minor\")\n      else:\n          print(\"strange\")\n\n  Let's test with the provided examples:\n\n      Example 1: \"C E G\" -> [0,4,7] -> found_major: permutation (0,4,7) -> d1=4, d2=3 -> True.\n\n      Example 2: \"C# B F\" -> [1,10,5] -> we need to find the permutation that gives d1=3 and d2=4.\n          [10,1,5]: \n              d1 = (1-10)%12 = (1-10+12)=3, d2=(5-1)=4 -> found_minor.\n\n      Example 3: \"A B H\" -> [9,10,11] (A=9, B=10, H=11)\n          Check all permutations:\n\n          [9,10,11]: \n              d1= (10-9)=1, d2=(11-10)=1 -> no.\n          [9,11,10]:\n              d1= (11-9)=2, d2=(10-11+12)=11 -> no.\n          [10,9,11]:\n              d1= (9-10+12)=11, d2=(11-9)=2 -> no.\n          [10,11,9]:\n              d1= (11-10)=1, d2=(9-11+12)=10 -> no.\n          [11,9,10]:\n              d1= (9-11+12)=10, d2=(10-9)=1 -> no.\n          [11,10,9]:\n              d1= (10-11+12)=11, d2=(9-10+12)=11 -> no.\n\n          So output \"strange\", which matches.\n\n  But wait, what if the chord is in a different inversion and the intervals are not consecutive? \n\n  Example: \"C E G\" in inversion: \"G C E\" -> [7,0,4] -> we already saw that permutation [0,4,7] is generated from the set [7,0,4] (same set) so it will be found.\n\n  However, note: the set of numbers is the same. The permutations are generated from the same set. \n\n  But what if the input is not distinct? The problem says chord is an unordered set, so distinct. We assume distinct.\n\n  Let's assume distinct.\n\n  Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the teacher gave a chord (three notes). We assume three distinct notes.\n\n  We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n  But wait: what if the input has duplicate notes? The problem says \"exactly three notes\", so we assume distinct.\n\n  We are good.\n\n  Let me run through the example \"C E G\" and \"E G C\" again to ensure we capture the correct ordering.\n\n  Code:\n\n      import itertools\n\n      note_to_index = {\n          'C': 0,\n          'C#': 1, \n          'D': 2,\n          'D#': 3,\n          'E': 4,\n          'F': 5,\n          'F#': 6,\n          'G': 7,\n          'G#': 8,\n          'A': 9,\n          'B': 10,\n          'H': 11\n      }\n\n      s = input().split()\n      n_list = [note_to_index[note] for note in s]\n\n      # Generate all permutations\n      from itertools import permutations\n      found_major = False\n      found_minor = False\n\n      for p in permutations(n_list):\n          x, y, z = p\n          d1 = (y - x) % 12\n          d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n          if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n              found_major = True\n          if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n              found_minor = True\n\n      if found_major:\n          print(\"major\")\n      elif found_minor:\n          print(\"minor\")\n      else:\n          print(\"strange\")\n\n  This should be the solution.\n\n  However, note: the modulus operation for negative numbers in Python: \n      (a - b) % 12 is computed as (a - b) mod 12, and if a-b is negative, it adds 12 until non-negative.\n\n  Example: (0-4)%12 = (-4)%12 = 8 (because -4 + 12 = 8). But wait, in our calculation we use (y-x) and (z-y). \n\n  In the example [4,7,0] (E, G, C): \n      x=4, y=7, z=0\n      d1 = (7-4)%12 = 3 -> correct.\n      d2 = (0-7)%12 = (-7)%12 = 5 -> correct.\n\n  But note: the example [10,1,5] (B, C#, F):\n      d1 = (1-10)%12 = (-9)%12 = 3 -> correct.\n      d2 = (5-1)%12 = 4 -> correct.\n\n  So the modulus operation is working as expected.\n\n  We are done.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for a major or minor chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each note is mapped to a unique integer (0 to 11) based on its position in the 12-note musical scale (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H).\n2. **Generating Permutations**: For the given three notes, generate all possible permutations (orderings) of these notes.\n3. **Checking Chord Conditions**: For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes in the forward direction (modulo 12). If any permutation has distances of 4 and 3 semitones (indicating a major chord) or 3 and 4 semitones (indicating a minor chord), mark the corresponding chord type as found.\n4. **Result Determination**: After checking all permutations, output \"major\" if a major chord was found, \"minor\" if a minor chord was found, or \"strange\" if neither was found.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnote_to_index = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\ndef main():\n    s = input().split()\n    n_list = [note_to_index[note] for note in s]\n    \n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for p in itertools.permutations(n_list):\n        x, y, z = p\n        d1 = (y - x) % 12\n        d2 = (z - y) % 12\n        \n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n    if found_major:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The `note_to_index` dictionary maps each note to its corresponding position in the 12-note scale. For example, 'C' maps to 0, 'C#' to 1, and so on up to 'H' which maps to 11.\n2. **Input Handling**: The input string is split into individual notes, which are then converted to their respective indices using the dictionary.\n3. **Permutation Check**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible orderings of the three notes are generated. For each ordering, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Chord Identification**: The distances between consecutive notes in each permutation are checked against the criteria for major (4 and 3 semitones) and minor (3 and 4 semitones) chords. If either condition is met, the corresponding flag is set.\n5. **Output Result**: Based on the flags set during the permutation check, the program outputs \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" to indicate the type of chord formed by the input notes. \n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible orderings of the input notes to determine the chord type, leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of musical notes. The solution ensures correctness by exhaustively verifying all permutations before concluding the result.",
