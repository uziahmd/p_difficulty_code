Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers: n (number of vertices) and a (the target angle in degrees)\n\n In a regular convex n-gon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is (360/n) degrees.\n\n We are to choose three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle at v2 formed by the points (v1, v2, v3) is as close as possible to `a`.\n\n Note: The polygon is regular and convex, so the vertices are equally spaced on a circle.\n\n How do we compute the angle?\n There are two ways to form an angle at vertex v2: \n   - The angle can be measured inside the polygon (so it must be less than 180°) or sometimes we might consider the reflex angle? But note: the problem says \"convex\", so the angle we are forming must be the one that is inside the polygon? Actually, note that the problem says: \"three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3\" and the angle is defined by the sides from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3.\n\n However, note: the problem does not specify that the angle must be interior. But since the polygon is convex, any triangle we form will have the angle at v2 being the one facing the interior? Actually, the problem does not restrict the side lengths or direction. But note: the example outputs for a square (n=4) with a=67 and a=68 show that they are using angles that are not necessarily the interior ones.\n\n Let's analyze:\n\n In a regular polygon, the vertices are on a circle. Therefore, the angle at v2 is determined by the arcs from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3.\n\n We can also think of the angle as being formed by two chords from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\n The key is: the measure of the inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the same arc.\n\n However, note: the angle we are computing is at vertex v2, and the two points are v1 and v3. This angle is an inscribed angle that subtends the arc from v1 to v3 (not containing v2). But wait: there are two arcs from v1 to v3: the minor and major. The inscribed angle uses the arc that is opposite to the angle. \n\n Alternatively, we can use the following approach:\n\n Since the polygon is cyclic, the angle at v2 is related to the arcs between the points.\n\n Actually, we can use the formula for the angle in a cyclic quadrilateral? Or better, we can use the fact that the angle is half the difference of the arcs? But note: the angle we are measuring is the angle between two chords from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3.\n\n There is a formula: the measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting at a point on the circle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. However, in our case, the chords are from a common endpoint on the circle. So this is an inscribed angle that intercepts an arc.\n\n But wait: the angle at v2 is an inscribed angle that intercepts the arc from v1 to v3 (the one not containing v2). However, note that the angle is actually the one that is opposite to the arc from v1 to v3 (the one that doesn't contain v2). However, in a circle, the inscribed angle is half the central angle of the intercepted arc.\n\n However, note: the angle we are measuring is the one at v2, so the intercepted arc is the one from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2. Then the angle is half of (arc_v1_to_v3) if the angle is on the circumference and the center is on the side of the chord opposite to the angle? Actually, standard: the inscribed angle is half the central angle of the intercepted arc.\n\n But note: the problem does not require the angle to be the inscribed angle for the entire arc from v1 to v3. Actually, the angle at v2 is the angle between the two chords. The intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to the angle. In fact, the angle at v2 is the angle of the triangle v1v2v3. \n\n There is a simpler way: in a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. The intercepted arc is the arc between v1 and v3 that is \"seen\" from v2. However, note that the angle at v2 could be the minor or major arc? Actually, the inscribed angle is always the minor arc (if the angle is acute or obtuse but less than 180). \n\n But wait: the problem says the polygon is convex, so the three points must form a triangle that lies entirely in the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at the vertex (v2) by the other two vertices (v1 and v3) is as close as possible to a given target angle (a). The solution involves leveraging geometric properties of cyclic polygons to efficiently determine the optimal vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that in a regular convex polygon, the vertices lie on a circle. The angle formed at any vertex v2 by points v1 and v3 can be derived using the central angles between these vertices. The inscribed angle theorem states that the angle at v2 is half the difference of the arcs between v1 and v3. However, since the polygon is regular, the vertices are equally spaced, allowing us to compute angles based on the number of steps between vertices.\n\n2. **Angle Calculation**: For each vertex v2, the angle formed by vertices v1 and v3 depends on their positions relative to v2. The angle can be calculated by considering the smallest arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2. The angle is then determined by the number of steps (edges) between these vertices.\n\n3. **Optimal Angle Selection**: The goal is to minimize the absolute difference between the computed angle and the target angle (a). Given the symmetry of the regular polygon, we can consider all possible angles that can be formed by any three vertices and select the one closest to (a).\n\n4. **Efficiency**: Directly checking all possible triplets would be computationally expensive (O(n^3)), which is infeasible for large n (up to 10^5). Instead, we recognize that the optimal angle must be either exactly (a) or one of its nearest neighbors in the set of possible angles. By iterating over possible angles derived from the polygon's structure, we can efficiently find the closest match without exhaustive search.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = int(data[1])\n    \n    total_angle = 360.0\n    step_angle = total_angle / n\n    half_step = step_angle / 2.0\n    \n    best_diff = float('inf')\n    best_vertices = None\n    \n    if n == 3:\n        print(\"1 2 3\")\n        return\n        \n    for k in range(1, (n // 2) + 1):\n        angle1 = abs(k * step_angle - a)\n        angle2 = abs((k * step_angle) % 360 - a)\n        diff1 = min(angle1, angle2)\n        angle_value = 180 - 2 * (k * step_angle)\n        angle_value %= 360\n        angle_value = min(angle_value, 360 - angle_value)\n        diff2 = abs(angle_value - a)\n        \n        if diff2 < best_diff:\n            best_diff = diff2\n            best_vertices = [k+1, 2*k+1, 3*k+1] if k*3 < n else [k+1, 2*k+1, 3*k+1 - n]\n            \n    if best_vertices is None:\n        for k in range(1, (n // 2) + 1):\n            angle1 = abs(k * step_angle - a)\n            angle2 = abs((k * step_angle) % 360 - a)\n            diff1 = min(angle1, angle2)\n            if diff1 < best_diff:\n                best_diff = diff1\n                best_vertices = [k+1, 2*k+1, 3*k+1] if k*3 < n else [k+1, 2*k+1, 3*k+1 - n]\n                \n    print(f\"{best_vertices[0]} {best_vertices[1]} {best_vertices[2]}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, n (number of vertices) and a (target angle), from standard input.\n2. **Special Case for Triangle**: If the polygon is a triangle (n=3), the only possible angle is 60 degrees, so the solution defaults to vertices 1, 2, and 3.\n3. **Angle Calculation**: For each possible step count k (from 1 to n//2), the program calculates the angle formed by vertices separated by k edges. The angle is derived using the properties of the regular polygon and the inscribed angle theorem.\n4. **Optimal Vertex Selection**: The program checks all feasible angles and selects the triplet of vertices that forms the angle closest to the target angle (a). The selection considers both direct and modular arithmetic differences to ensure accuracy.\n5. **Output**: The program prints the three vertices forming the closest angle. If multiple solutions exist, any valid triplet is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using geometric properties, ensuring optimal performance even for large polygons.",
