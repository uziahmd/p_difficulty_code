His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x in the first line, then two lists of n integers each: the first tour and second tour.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We know that Vasya's total is at least x (so his two scores from the two tours must add up to at least x).\n 2. The problem is that the results are anonymous: we don't know which score in the first list corresponds to which in the second.\n\n We are to find the best and worst place Vasya could have got.\n\n How to approach:\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let A = list of first tour points.\n   Let B = list of second tour points.\n\n But note: we have two lists of n integers, and we know that Vasya has a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= x.\n\n However, we are not told which one is Vasya's. But note: the problem says \"there are two integers i, j such that ai + bj >= x\".\n\n Actually, the problem states: \"the teacher has to know Vasya's chances\" meaning we are considering all participants (including Vasya) and we know that Vasya has at least x total.\n\n But wait: the input includes n participants, each with a first tour score and a second tour score (but the two lists are given arbitrarily).\n\n However, note: the problem says the results have only points, no names. And the two lists are for the same n participants, but the order is arbitrary.\n\n So, we can reassign the second tour scores arbitrarily to the first tour scores? Actually, no: we are given two separate lists, and each participant has one score from the first and one from the second.\n\n But here's the catch: we don't know which participant is which. However, the problem says: \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\", so there are exactly n participants, each having one a_i and one b_j.\n\n However, the input gives two lists of n numbers. So, we have n pairs (a_i, b_j) but the pairing is unknown.\n\n But note: the problem does not say that the two lists are for the same set of participants in the same order. Actually, the two lists are independent: the first list is the first tour, the second list is the second tour, and the participants are the same n people, but the assignment of which person got which score in the first and which in the second is arbitrary.\n\n Therefore, we can consider that we have n participants, each with two scores. The two lists give the multiset of the first tour scores and the multiset of the second tour scores.\n\n Then, what is Vasya's total? We don't know, but we know that he has at least x. However, the problem does not specify which participant is Vasya. But note: the condition is that Vasya's total is at least x. So, we are to consider that there exists at least one participant (namely Vasya) who has a pair (a, b) such that a+b>=x.\n\n Now, the ranking is by the sum (a+b). In case of ties, the jury can assign the places arbitrarily.\n\n We need to compute:\n   Best place: the highest rank (lowest number) Vasya can get.\n   Worst place: the lowest rank (highest number) Vasya can get.\n\n How?\n\n Approach:\n\n 1. We can form all possible n pairs? That would be O(n^2) which is too slow for n up to 10^5.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n Consider: We are free to assign the second list to the first list arbitrarily, except that we know that Vasya has at least one pair (a, b) such that a+b>=x.\n\n But note: the problem does not require knowing which one is Vasya's pair. Instead, we are to consider that Vasya is one of the participants, and the rest are the others. The entire table is built by the n pairs.\n\n However, we cannot change the multiset of the first tour and the second tour. So, the set of all pairs is fixed: the multiset of pairs is the Cartesian product? No, because the problem states: \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\", meaning we have n pairs, but we don't know the pairing.\n\n But wait: the input gives two lists of n integers. This means that the multiset of the first tour scores is given, and the multiset of the second tour scores is given. However, the pairing is arbitrary.\n\n Therefore, we can choose any pairing. And we are to assume that Vasya is one of the participants, and we know that his total is at least x.\n\n However, note: the condition is that there exists a pair (from the Cartesian product) that sums to at least x. But actually, we are told",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The key insight is that the pairing of participants' scores from the first and second tours can vary, affecting their total points and thus their rankings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves finding the best and worst ranks Vasya can get given that his total points from both tours are at least `x`. The challenge lies in efficiently determining these ranks without checking all possible pairings, which would be computationally expensive for large `n`.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The best rank (1st place) is achieved when Vasya's total points are as high as possible, and the worst rank (last place) is when his total points are as low as possible (but still at least `x`). \n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting**: Both the first tour scores (`a`) and second tour scores (`b`) are sorted separately.\n   - **Two Pointers Technique**: For the best rank, we use a two-pointer approach to find pairs where the sum of scores is maximized. For the worst rank, we adjust the pairing strategy to minimize Vasya's total while ensuring it meets the minimum requirement.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the arrays takes O(n log n) time. The two-pointer technique operates in O(n) time for each scenario (best and worst), making the overall complexity O(n log n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+2*n]))\n    \n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    \n    best_rank = 1\n    i = 0\n    j = n - 1\n    max_val = -1\n    while i < n and j >= 0:\n        s = a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[j]\n        if s >= x:\n            max_val = s\n            break\n        j -= 1\n        i += 1\n        \n    if max_val == -1:\n        best_rank = n + 1\n    else:\n        count_max = 0\n        temp_a = a_sorted[:]\n        temp_b = b_sorted[:]\n        j = n - 1\n        for i in range(n):\n            s = temp_a[i] + temp_b[j]\n            if s == max_val:\n                count_max += 1\n                j -= 1\n            elif s < max_val:\n                j -= 1\n            else:\n                pass\n        best_rank = count_max + 1\n        \n    worst_rank = 1\n    total_points = [a_i + b_j for a_i, b_j in zip(a, b)]\n    vasya_total = max([s for s in total_points if s >= x]) if any(s >= x for s in total_points) else 0\n    if vasya_total == 0:\n        worst_rank = n + 1\n    else:\n        total_sorted = sorted(total_points, reverse=True)\n        rank = 1\n        for t in total_sorted:\n            if t > vasya_total:\n                rank += 1\n            elif t == vasya_total:\n                break\n        worst_rank = rank\n        \n    print(str(best_rank) + \" \" + str(worst_rank))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of participants `n`, the minimum required total points `x`, and the lists of scores from the first and second tours.\n2. **Sorting**: Both score lists are sorted to facilitate the two-pointer technique.\n3. **Best Rank Calculation**: Using a two-pointer approach, we find the highest possible total points Vasya can achieve. The number of participants with higher or equal totals determines his best rank.\n4. **Worst Rank Calculation**: We sort all participants' total points in descending order. Vasya's worst rank is determined by his position in this sorted list, considering his minimum qualifying total.\n5. **Output**: The best and worst ranks are printed, providing Vasya's teacher with the desired information.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible ranks by leveraging sorting and strategic pointer movement, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
