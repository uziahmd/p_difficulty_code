He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed that there are exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1, and the total number of strings is 2n-2.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the integer n.\n 2. Read the next 2n-2 lines (each line is a string).\n 3. We know that for each length L from 1 to n-1, there are two strings: one prefix and one suffix.\n\n However, note: the problem does not specify which ones are which, and we have to assign each string as either 'P' or 'S'. Conditions:\n   - There must be exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes (so one of each type for each length? Actually, for each length L from 1 to n-1, we have two strings: one will be a prefix and one will be a suffix, but note: the same string might appear twice? The example input \"3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na\" has two 'aa' and two 'a'.)\n\n Important: It is guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n.\n\n Observation:\n  Since the string s of length n must have:\n    - A prefix of length 1: s[0:1]\n    - A prefix of length 2: s[0:2]\n    - ... \n    - A prefix of length n-1: s[0:n-1]\n\n  Similarly for suffixes.\n\n But note: the set of given strings includes all proper prefixes and suffixes. Also, it is guaranteed that they are the prefixes and suffixes of some string of length n.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Idea: \n  We can use the following: \n  For a fixed string s of length n, the prefix of length i is s[0:i] and the suffix of length i is s[i-1:] (if we consider 0-indexed, then the suffix of length i is s[n-i:n]? Actually, in Python, the suffix of length i is the last i characters: s[-i:].\n\n However, the problem gives us 2n-2 strings. We don't know the original string.\n\n Alternate idea: \n  We know that the entire string s must be such that for each length i (from 1 to n-1) the two given strings of length i must be the prefix and the suffix of s.\n\n  But note: the two strings of a given length i might not necessarily be the only two? Actually, the problem states: \"exactly 2 strings of each length\".\n\n  Let's denote by S the set of given strings.\n\n  We can try to reconstruct the string s? \n\n  However, note: n is at most 100, but the total number of strings is 2n-2 = 198 when n=100. But we cannot try all possibilities.\n\n Another idea: \n  Consider the following: the two strings of length 1 must be the first character and the last character of s.\n\n  For the two strings of length 1, say x and y. Then:\n      s[0] = x and s[-1] = y, OR s[0] = y and s[-1] = x?\n\n  But wait: we don't know which is which. However, we also have the two strings of length 2.\n\n  Let the two strings of length 2 be ab and cd.\n\n  Then the string s must have:\n      s[0] = a (if ab is the prefix of length 2) then s[0:2] = ab -> so s[0]=a, s[1]=b.\n      Or if ab is the suffix of length 2, then s[-2:] = ab -> so s[n-2] = a, s[n-1]=b.\n\n  Similarly for cd.\n\n  Also, the two strings of length 1: we know the first character must be either the first character of the prefix of length 2 or the first character of the suffix of length 2? Not exactly.\n\n  Actually, the prefix of length 2 must start with the first character (which is the prefix of length 1). Similarly, the suffix of length 2 must end with the last character (which is the suffix of length 1).\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n  Step 1: Group the strings by their lengths.\n\n  Step 2: For length 1, we have two strings: let them be a and b.\n\n  Then, for the string s, the first character must be one of them and the last character the other.\n\n  Now, consider the two strings of length 2. They must be consistent with the first and last characters.\n\n  But note: the problem says that there is at least one string that is consistent.\n\n  However, we are allowed to output any valid assignment.\n\n  We can try:\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string of length `n`. The solution involves analyzing the given strings and their lengths to assign each string as either a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S').\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Strings by Length**: The input consists of `2n-2` strings, with exactly two strings for each length from 1 to `n-1`. We first group these strings by their lengths.\n2. **Identify First and Last Characters**: The strings of length 1 must be the first character of the unknown string (prefix) and the last character (suffix). Thus, we can directly assign one of them as 'P' and the other as 'S'.\n3. **Check Consistency for Longer Strings**: For strings of length greater than 1, we verify if they can be formed by combining the known first and last characters. Specifically, for a string of length `k`, the first character must match the first character of the unknown string (if it's a prefix) and the last character must match the last character (if it's a suffix).\n4. **Assign Labels**: For each string, based on its length and the consistency check, assign 'P' if it matches the prefix pattern or 'S' if it matches the suffix pattern. If a string doesn't match either, it might be an invalid assignment, but the problem guarantees that at least one valid string exists.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    total_strings = 2 * n - 2\n    all_strings = []\n    for _ in range(total_strings):\n        all_strings.append(input().strip())\n    \n    grouped = {}\n    for s in all_strings:\n        l = len(s)\n        if l not in grouped:\n            grouped[l] = []\n        grouped[l].append(s)\n    \n    labels = [''] * total_strings\n    \n    # Handle length 1 separately\n    len1 = grouped[1]\n    first_char = len1[0][0]\n    second_char = len1[1][0]\n    if first_char == second_char:\n        # In this case, both strings are the same, but the problem states there are two strings of length 1.\n        # According to the problem guarantee, this should not happen unless n=2 and the two strings are the same.\n        # But note: the example \"2\\na\\nc\" has two different strings of length 1.\n        # Actually, the problem says: \"each of them is the string of length from 1 to n-1\", and \"exactly 2 strings of each length\".\n        # So if the two strings of length 1 are the same, then the first and last character must be the same.\n        # Then we can assign arbitrarily?

One is assigned 'P' (prefix) and the other 'S' (suffix).\n4. **Processing Longer Strings**: For each string of length greater than 1, the code checks if the first character matches the first character of the unknown string and the last character matches the last character. If so, it's a prefix ('P'); otherwise, it's a suffix ('S').\n5. **Output**: The labels for all strings are concatenated into a single string and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the problem constraints and guarantees to determine the correct assignments for each string, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal.",
