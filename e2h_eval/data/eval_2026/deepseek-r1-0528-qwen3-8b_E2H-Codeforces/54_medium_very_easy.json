Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers: n (number of vertices) and a (the target angle in degrees)\n We are to find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 (from 1 to n) such that the angle at v2 (with v1 and v3 on the sides) is as close as possible to `a`.\n\n In a regular convex polygon with n sides, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require the polygon to be used only by taking consecutive vertices. But note: the polygon is regular and convex, so the vertices are equally spaced on a circle.\n\n The key observation: \n The angle formed by three vertices in a convex polygon can be computed using the circle properties.\n\n Actually, we can consider the circle on which the polygon lies. The angle at vertex v2 (which is the angle of the triangle v1v2v3) can be calculated by the inscribed angle theorem.\n\n But note: there's an easier way because the polygon is regular. We can fix the middle vertex v2 and then choose two other vertices (v1 and v3) that are separated by k and l edges respectively (in the two directions). However, we must consider the circular nature.\n\n Alternatively, note that the angle at v2 is determined by the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. The entire circle is 360 degrees. The inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc between the two points (excluding the one at the center?).\n\n Actually, we can use the fact that the angle at the circumference is half the central angle subtended by the same arc.\n\n However, there is a better approach: \n\n Consider that the angle at vertex v2 for the triangle v1v2v3 is actually (180 - (arc from v1 to v3 passing through the opposite side)/2) ??? Not exactly.\n\n Let me recall: In a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the same arc.\n\n But note: our angle at v2 is the angle between the two chords v2v1 and v2v3. This angle is half the difference of the two arcs? Actually, no. The inscribed angle for an angle formed by two chords from a point on the circle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs? \n\n Wait, actually, the standard formula for the angle between two chords (an inscribed angle) is: \n   angle = (arc1 - arc2) / 2   [if the angle is formed by two chords and the arcs are the ones that the angle \"sees\"]\n\n However, let's clarify:\n\n In a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. But in our case, the angle at v2 intercepts the arc from v1 to v3 that does NOT contain v2.\n\n So, if we let d be the central angle corresponding to the arc from v1 to v3 (the one that does not contain v2), then the inscribed angle at v2 (which is on the circle) would be half of that arc? Actually, wait: the inscribed angle is defined by the arc that is opposite to it. The angle at v2 is formed by the two chords and intercepts the arc from v1 to v3 (the one that is opposite to v2). Then the angle should be (arc from v1 to v3) / 2.\n\n But note: the entire circle is 360. The two arcs from v1 to v3 are: one going clockwise and one going counter-clockwise. The inscribed angle at v2 uses the arc that does not contain v2. \n\n However, we have two possibilities: the arc from v1 to v3 that goes through one side of the circle and the other. But note: the polygon is convex and we are considering distinct vertices. We want the smallest angle? Actually, the angle we are measuring is the one inside the polygon (the smaller one). \n\n But note: the problem says \"the value |angle - a|\", and the angle is defined by the two sides (so it's the angle between the two vectors from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3). This angle is always taken to be the one that is less than or equal to 180 degrees.\n\n How to compute the angle?\n\n Alternatively, we can consider the following:\n\n The polygon is regular, so the positions of the vertices are known. We can assign each vertex i an angle (from the center) of (i-1)*(360/n) degrees (assuming vertices numbered 0 to n-1, but we'll use 1-indexed).\n\n However, we are to find three distinct vertices. The angle at vertex v2 (say at position x) for points v1 (at position y) and v3 (at position z) can be computed by the central angles.\n\n Actually, the angle at the circumference (v2) is half the central angle of the opposite arc. The opposite arc is the one from y to z that does not contain x.\n\n But note: the entire circle is 360. The arc from y to z (the one that doesn't contain x) is the minor arc? Actually, we have two arcs: one containing x and one not. The inscribed angle is half the arc that is opposite (the one not containing x). \n\n However, there's a simpler way: \n\n We can consider the two arcs from y to z: the one that goes through x and the one that does not. The inscribed angle at x is half the measure of the arc from y to z that does not contain x.\n\n But note: the angle we are computing is the one at x (vertex v2). The intercepted arc is from y to z (the one that does not include x). \n\n Therefore, the angle θ = (arc(y,z) without x) / 2.\n\n However, note: the entire circle is 360, so the two arcs from y to z add up to 360. The intercepted arc (opposite) is the one that does not contain x, and we denote it as A. Then the other arc (containing x) is 360 - A. But note: the inscribed angle is defined by the intercepted arc (A). So θ = A/2.\n\n But wait: is that correct? Actually, yes. The inscribed angle is half the intercepted arc.\n\n However, note: the angle we are forming at x might also be the reflex angle? But the problem states that the polygon is convex and we are taking three distinct vertices. The angle we are considering is the one inside the polygon (the smaller one). So we are only concerned with angles between 0 and 180.\n\n Since the intercepted arc A must be between 0 and 360, then the angle θ = A/2 can be between 0 and 180. But note: if A is greater than 360? No, because the circle is 360. Also, if we take the arc that is opposite, then A is the arc from y to z that does not contain x, and since x is fixed, the arc A is the one that is the shorter one? Actually, no: the inscribed angle formula uses the intercepted arc (the one that the angle \"sees\"). In a circle, the inscribed angle is half the intercepted arc, and the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to the angle. But note: the angle is always taken to be the smaller one (so the intercepted arc is the one that is <= 180*2? Actually, no: the inscribed angle can be up to 180, so the intercepted arc must be up to 360? Actually, the maximum inscribed angle is 180 (when the arc is 360? That doesn't make sense). \n\n Let me clarify with examples:\n\n Example 1: Equilateral triangle (n=3). The central angle between two adjacent vertices is 120. The inscribed angle for an arc of 120 degrees (the minor arc) is 60. But wait: the entire circle is 360. The intercepted arc for the angle at a vertex in an equilateral triangle: the opposite arc is the arc from the other two vertices. In an equilateral triangle, the two sides from a vertex go to the two adjacent vertices, and the intercepted arc is the arc that goes from one adjacent to the next (the one opposite to the vertex). This arc is 120 degrees (because the central angle is 120). Then the inscribed angle is 60. So that matches.\n\n Example 2: Square (n=4). The central angle is 90. Now, if we take a vertex and two adjacent vertices (like in the square, the two neighbors) then the intercepted arc is 90 (because the arc from one adjacent to the next (adjacent to the vertex) is 90). Then the inscribed angle is 45. But the example input was 4 67 -> output 45 degrees is chosen because |45-67| < |90-67|. \n\n However, wait: in the square, if we take two adjacent vertices and the vertex itself, then the angle is 45. But what if we take two opposite vertices? Then the intercepted arc would be 180 (because the arc from one opposite vertex to the other that does not contain the vertex is 180). Then the inscribed angle would be 90. \n\n So indeed, we can get two angles: 45 and 90.\n\n Therefore, the angle we get is half the intercepted arc (the arc that does not contain the vertex). And the intercepted arc is the arc from v1 to v3 (without the vertex v2) and it must be between 0 and 360. But note: the angle is taken as the smaller one (so the intercepted arc must be the one that is less than or equal to 360). However, note that the inscribed angle is half the intercepted arc, and if the intercepted arc is more than 180, then the angle becomes more than 90, but the problem allows up to 180.\n\n However, note: the angle we are measuring is the one that is formed by the two chords. There are two angles at the intersection: the one we use is the one that is less than 180. But the inscribed angle formula gives an angle that is half the intercepted arc. The intercepted arc is defined as the one that is opposite to the angle. And the intercepted arc must be the one that is the one facing the angle. In a circle, the angle at the circumference is half the central angle of the intercepted arc. But if the intercepted arc is greater than 180, then the angle is still defined by that arc? Actually, the inscribed angle can be defined for arcs greater than 180? \n\n However, note: the angle at the circumference is always taken to be the smaller angle (so the intercepted arc is the one that is less than 360). But the formula holds for any arc: θ = (arc) / 2, and if the arc is greater than 360, then we reduce modulo 360? Actually, no. The arc we consider is the minor arc? Or the arc that is intercepted? \n\n Important: The inscribed angle theorem says: the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. The intercepted arc is the arc that lies in the interior of the angle. For an acute angle, the intercepted arc is the minor arc. For an obtuse angle, the intercepted arc is the major arc? Actually, no: the inscribed angle intercepts the arc that is opposite to it. \n\n But note: the angle at the circumference is always the smaller angle (<=180). Therefore, the intercepted arc must be the one that is less than 360 and such that the angle is θ = min(arc, 360-arc) / 2? \n\n Let me check: \n   If the intercepted arc is A, then the angle is A/2. But if A > 360, we don't consider that. Actually, A is between 0 and 360. And the angle is A/2, which is between 0 and 180. \n\n However, note: the angle at the circumference can be defined in two ways: the minor segment and the major segment. But the problem specifies that the angle is formed by the two sides (so we are taking the angle that is part of the polygon, which is the internal angle of the triangle? Actually, no: the angle is just the angle between the two chords. \n\n But note: the polygon is convex, and the vertices are in clockwise order. The angle at v2 (for the three points) is the angle that is formed by the two chords from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3, and we are to consider the angle that is facing the interior of the polygon. However, the problem does not specify which side, but note that the polygon is convex so the angle we form must be the one that is the internal angle of the triangle? Actually, the angle we are calculating is the one at the vertex of the triangle (which is just the angle between the two sides). \n\n However, the inscribed angle formula gives the angle as half the intercepted arc (the one that does not contain the vertex). But note: the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to the angle. In the context of the circle, the angle is the same regardless of the direction (as long as we take the smaller one). \n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We note that the angle we can form at a vertex v2 is determined by two other vertices v1 and v3. The angle is half the measure of the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2.\n\n 2. The entire circle is 360. The arc from v1 to v3 (the one that does not contain v2) can be calculated by the central angles.\n\n But note: we are working with a regular polygon. We can label the vertices 0 to n-1 (then convert to 1-indexed). The central angle between two vertices i and j is min(|i-j|, n-|i-j|)* (360/n). However, wait: the central angle between two vertices i and j is (min(|i-j|, n-|i-j|)) * (360/n) for the minor arc? Actually, the minor arc between i and j is min(|i-j|, n-|i-j|) * (360/n). \n\n But for the intercepted arc (the one that does not contain v2): \n   Let the positions of v1, v2, v3 be i, j, k (we can fix j as the vertex). Then the arc from i to k that does not contain j is the one that goes the long way around? Actually, no: we have two arcs from i to k: one passing through j and one not. The one that does not contain j is the longer one if j is between i and k on the circle? \n\n Actually, let's define:\n   Let d1 = the number of edges from i to j in the clockwise direction.\n   Let d2 = the number of edges from j to k in the clockwise direction.\n   Then the arc from i to k that does not contain j is the one that goes the other way: n - (d1 + d2) edges? \n\n But wait, the entire circle has n edges. The arc from i to k that contains j is (d1 + d2) edges? Then the arc that does not contain j is n - (d1+d2) edges.\n\n However, note: the arc in terms of central angle is (number of edges) * (360/n). \n\n Then the angle at j (vertex v2) is (arc that does not contain j) / 2 = (n - (d1+d2)) * (360/n) / 2.\n\n But wait, let me test with the equilateral triangle (n=3):\n\n Example: vertices 0,1,2. Take v2 = 1, and v1=0, v3=2. Then d1 (from 0 to 1) = 1 edge, d2 (from 1 to 2) = 1 edge. Then the arc that does not contain 1 is n - (d1+d2) = 3-2=1 edge. Then the angle = (1 * 120) / 2 = 60. Correct.\n\n Another example: square (n=4). Take v2=1, and v1=0, v3=2 (adjacent). Then d1=1, d2=1. The arc that does not contain 1 is 4-2=2 edges. Then angle = (2 * 90) / 2 = 90/2 = 45. Correct.\n\n Another example: square, take v2=1, and v1=0, v3=3 (opposite). Then d1 from 0 to 1: 1 edge, d2 from 1 to 3: 2 edges (because from 1->2->3). Then the arc that does not contain 1 is 4 - (1+2)=1 edge. Then angle = (1 * 90)/2 = 45. But wait, that gives 45, but we know that the opposite arc should be 180. \n\n What went wrong? \n\n Let me reexamine: \n\n The arc from i to k that does not contain j: \n   In the square, if we have vertices 0,1,2,3. Fix j=1 (vertex 1). Then consider i=0 and k=3: \n        The two paths from 0 to 3: \n            One path: 0->1->2->3 (length 3 edges, 270 degrees) \n            The other path: 0->3 (directly, but in a circle, the direct edge is 1 edge? Actually, the direct edge is the minor arc? \n\n But note: the central angle for the arc from 0 to 3 is the minimum between 3 and 1 (since n=4, min(3,1) is 1). However, the arc that does not contain j=1 is the one that goes from 0 to 3 without passing through 1. \n\n In the circle, the two arcs from 0 to 3: \n        The arc that goes 0->3 (clockwise) is 1 step (if we consider clockwise order: 0,1,2,3,0) then from 0 to 3 clockwise: 0->1->2->3 (3 steps) and counterclockwise: 0->3 (1 step). \n\n So the arc that does not contain 1 is the one that goes from 0 to 3 without passing 1, which is the counterclockwise arc (only 1 step). \n\n Therefore, the intercepted arc is 1 step (90 degrees). Then the angle at 1 is 90/2 = 45. \n\n But wait, we know that the angle for the diagonal in a square is 90 degrees. \n\n Why did we get 45? \n\n Let me draw: \n        Square: vertices 0,1,2,3 (0 at top, then 1 right, 2 bottom, 3 left). \n        Triangle: 0,1,3.\n        At vertex 1: \n            The two sides: from 1 to 0 (up) and from 1 to 3 (down-left).\n            The angle at vertex 1: the two sides are the horizontal and the diagonal. The angle between the horizontal and the diagonal (which is down-left) is 45 degrees? \n\n Actually, in the square, the angle at the corner (vertex 1) for the triangle 0,1,3 is the angle between the vector from 1 to 0 (which is up) and the vector from 1 to 3 (which is down-left). The angle at vertex 1 is the angle between these two vectors. \n\n The vector from 1 to 0 is (0,1) (if we set 1 at (1,1), then 0 at (0,1), 3 at (1,0)): \n        Vector1: (0-1, 1-1) = (-1,0) [from 1 to 0] -> wait, if we set coordinates: \n        Let 0: (0,1), 1: (1,1), 2: (1,0), 3: (0,0). Then from 1 to 0: (0-1,1-1)=(-1,0). From 1 to 3: (0-1,0-1)=(-1,-1). \n        The angle between (-1,0) and (-1,-1): \n            dot product = (-1)*(-1) + (0)*(-1) = 1.\n            magnitudes: sqrt(1+0)=1, sqrt(1+1)=sqrt(2)\n            cos(theta) = 1/(1*sqrt(2)) = 1/sqrt(2) => theta = 45 degrees.\n\n So the angle is 45. \n\n But wait, the example input says: \n        Input: \"4 67\" -> output \"2 1 3\" (which is vertices 2,1,3). \n\n Why is the example input 4 67 giving 45 degrees? Because 45 is closer to 67 than 90 is. \n\n However, the example also says: \n        Input: \"4 68\" -> output \"4 1 2\" (which is vertices 4,1,2). \n\n But wait, the example output says: \"4 1 2\", which corresponds to vertices 4,1,2. In a square with 4 vertices, the vertices are 1,2,3,4 (if we label clockwise). \n\n But note: the problem says: \"the vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order\".\n\n So the example input \"4 68\": \n        n=4, a=68. \n        The two candidate angles are 45 and 90. \n        |45-68| = 23, |90-68|=22 -> so 90 is closer? But the example output says 4 1 2.\n\n Let me check the example output: \n        Output: \"4 1 2\"\n\n But wait, the example output in the problem statement for the third sample is: \n        Input: \"4 68\"\n        Output: \"4 1 2\"\n\n And the note says: Other correct answers are: ... \"4 1 2\"\n\n However, wait: in the example note, they say that for input \"4 68\", the angle of 90 degrees was chosen. But the output \"4 1 2\" is the same as (v1=4, v2=1, v3=2). \n\n How do we map this to our indexing? \n\n The polygon has 4 vertices: labeled 1,2,3,4 (clockwise). \n        v2 is vertex 1. \n        v1 is vertex 4, and v3 is vertex 2.\n\n Now, the two edges from vertex 1: \n        To vertex 4: that's one edge (since 1 and 4 are adjacent in the square? Actually, in a square: \n        Clockwise: 1,2,3,4. Then 1 is adjacent to 2 and 4. \n        So from 1, the two adjacent vertices are 2 and 4. \n\n Therefore, the triangle is formed by vertices 1,2,4. \n\n The angle at vertex 1: \n        The two sides: from 1 to 4 and from 1 to 2. \n        These are the two adjacent edges. \n\n The angle at vertex 1 is the internal angle of the square? Actually, no: the internal angle of the square is 90, but that is the angle of the polygon. However, the angle we are computing is the angle of the triangle. \n\n In the triangle with vertices 1,2,4, the angle at 1 is the angle between the two sides 1-4 and 1-2. \n\n In the square, the two sides from 1 are perpendicular. Therefore, the angle is 90.\n\n Why did the example input \"4 68\" choose 90 (which is closer to 68 than 45 is)? \n\n So the example input \"4 68\" -> angle 90 is chosen.\n\n Now, how do we compute the angle for the configuration (v2, v1, v3) = (1,4,2) in the square?\n\n Steps for computation:\n\n 1. Fix the vertex v2 (which is 1). \n 2. The two other vertices are 4 and 2. \n\n How to compute the central angles? \n\n Alternatively, we can compute the angle using the inscribed angle formula: \n\n The intercepted arc is the arc from v1 (4) to v3 (2) that does not contain v2 (1). \n\n In the circle, the two arcs from 4 to 2: \n        One arc: 4->1->2 (which passes through 1) -> this is 2 edges (central angle = 2*(360/4)=180 degrees).\n        The other arc: 4->3->2 (does not pass through 1) -> this is 2 edges (central angle 180 degrees) as well? \n\n Wait, the circle has 4 edges. The arc from 4 to 2: \n        The direct arc (without going through 1) is from 4 to 3 to 2: 2 edges (180 degrees). \n\n But note: the intercepted arc (the one that does not contain the vertex 1) is 180 degrees. Then the angle is 180/2 = 90.\n\n So the formula: \n        angle = (arc_length) / 2, where arc_length is the central angle of the intercepted arc (the one not containing the vertex) in degrees.\n\n How to compute the arc length (in terms of edges) for the intercepted arc? \n\n Let d_total = n (total edges). \n Let the two arcs from v1 to v3 be: \n        arc1 (via the vertex) = (the number of edges from v1 to v2 plus from v2 to v3) = (steps from v1 to v2) + (steps from v2 to v3) in the clockwise direction? \n\n Actually, we can break the circle into two arcs: \n        The arc from v1 to v3 that contains v2: let this be L1 (in edges) and the other arc is L2 = n - L1.\n\n Then the intercepted arc (not containing v2) is L2 (edges) and the central angle is L2 * (360/n) degrees.\n\n Then the angle at v2 is (L2 * (360/n)) / 2 = L2 * (180/n).\n\n But note: we can also express L2 as the number of edges in the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2.\n\n How to compute L2 from the positions?\n\n Let the vertices be arranged in a circle. We can fix the vertex v2 at position 0 (by rotation). Then the positions of v1 and v3 are two indices. \n\n But note: we are free to choose any three distinct vertices. We cannot try all triplets because n can be up to 10^5.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We are to minimize |angle - a|, where angle = (arc_length) * (180/n) (with arc_length being the number of edges in the intercepted arc).\n\n Note: the angle must be between 0 and 180. And the arc_length (number of edges) is an integer between 1 and n-1 (but note: the arc that does not contain v2 must be at least 1 and at most n-1). \n\n However, note: the arc_length (edges) must be at least 1 and at most n-1, but also note that the two arcs must be non-empty. \n\n But wait: the arc from v1 to v3 (not containing v2) must be at least 1 edge? Actually, the minimal arc is 1 edge (then the angle is 180/n). \n\n However, we can also consider that the two vertices v1 and v3 can be chosen arbitrarily, but they must be distinct and different from v2.\n\n The angle is determined by the arc_length (which is an integer from 1 to n-1). \n\n Then the set of possible angles is { (k * (180/n)) / 2 * 2? } -> wait, no: the angle is (arc_length * 360/n) / 2 = (arc_length * 180/n) degrees.\n\n But note: the arc_length is the number of edges in the intercepted arc, so the central angle is (arc_length * (360/n)) and then the inscribed angle is half of that: (arc_length * 180/n) degrees.\n\n Now, we are to find an integer k (from 1 to n-1) such that |(k * 180/n) - a| is minimized.\n\n However, note: k is the number of edges in the intercepted arc, and k must be at least 1 and at most n-1. But also, note that k must be the arc that does not contain v2, and the other arc (containing v2) is n - k (edges). \n\n But wait: the two arcs from v1 to v3 (the one containing v2 and the one not) must satisfy: k + (n - k) = n? Actually, no: the two arcs (in terms of edges) are k and n-k, but note: the entire circle is n edges. \n\n However, note: the arc from v1 to v3 (the one containing v2) is the rest of the circle: n - k edges? \n\n But wait, the central angle for the intercepted arc (not containing v2) is k * (360/n) degrees. Then the other arc is (n-k) * (360/n) degrees. \n\n The condition: k must be the arc that does not contain v2, and the other arc (containing v2) is n-k.\n\n But note: k can be any integer from 1 to n-1.\n\n However, we must also consider that the two vertices v1 and v3 must be distinct and distinct from v2, and the arc k must be the one that does not contain v2.\n\n But note: the same angle (k * 180/n) can be achieved by many configurations.\n\n Therefore, the problem reduces to:\n\n Find an integer k (1<=k<=n-1) that minimizes | (k * 180/n) - a |.\n\n Then, we must output a triplet of vertices (v1, v2, v3) that produces the arc k (the intercepted arc) and the vertex v2.\n\n However, note: the same k can be achieved by many choices of v1 and v3. We need to output one triplet.\n\n But wait: is every k from 1 to n-1 achievable? \n\n Yes, because we can fix v2, and then choose v1 and v3 such that the intercepted arc (not containing v2) has k edges. \n\n How to assign k? \n\n The entire circle has n edges. The intercepted arc (k edges) is the arc from v1 to v3 (the one that does not contain v2). Then the other arc (from v1 to v3 containing v2) is n-k edges.\n\n How to choose v1 and v3 given k and v2?\n\n We can fix v2. Then, we can choose v1 and v3 such that the arc from v1 to v3 (not containing v2) is k edges.\n\n Specifically, if we fix v2, then we can choose v1 and v3 such that the arc from v1 to v3 (going the long way) is k edges. \n\n But note: the arc from v1 to v3 (not containing v2) is k edges. Then the two vertices v1 and v3 must be separated by k edges in the circle (without going through v2). \n\n However, note: the vertices are discrete. We can do:\n\n   Let the vertices be 0,1,...,n-1 (for simplicity, then convert to 1-indexed by adding 1).\n\n   Fix v2 at 0.\n\n   Then, we need to choose two vertices v1 and v3 such that the arc from v1 to v3 (not containing 0) has k edges.\n\n   How? \n\n   The arc from v1 to v3 (not containing 0) of k edges means that the two vertices v1 and v3 are separated by k edges along the circle, and the path from v1 to v3 (without going through 0) is k edges.\n\n   Then, the starting vertex v1 can be any vertex, and then v3 is (v1 + k) mod n, but then we have to ensure that the arc from v1 to v3 (without 0) is k. \n\n   Actually, we must avoid including 0 in the arc. \n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the entire circle is divided by v2 (vertex 0) into two arcs: one of length k (the intercepted arc) and the other of length n-k.\n\n   Then, the two vertices v1 and v3 must lie in the same contiguous segment of the circle that is the intercepted arc? \n\n   Actually, the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2, so v1 and v3 must be in the arc of k edges. \n\n   But note: the intercepted arc of k edges is a contiguous set of k edges. Then the two vertices must be chosen from that arc. \n\n   However, we can also think: the arc from v1 to v3 (not containing v2) must be exactly k edges. Then the two vertices are separated by k edges (along the circle without crossing v2). \n\n   How to map k to the actual vertices? \n\n   Since the polygon is cyclic, we can represent the circle as:\n\n        Vertices: 0,1,...,n-1.\n\n        Fix v2 = 0.\n\n        The intercepted arc (not containing 0) of k edges: then the arc goes from some vertex i to vertex (i+k) mod n, and the entire arc from i to i+k (without wrapping around) must not contain 0.\n\n        But note: k can be from 1 to n-1. \n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the angle is determined by k, so we can precompute the best k (the one minimizing | (k * 180/n) - a |) and then pick a triplet that gives that k.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Read n, a.\n\n   Step 2: Compute the best k (integer in [1, n-1]) that minimizes | (k * 180/n) - a |.\n\n   Step 3: Output a triplet (v1, v2, v3) that produces the arc k.\n\n   But note: the angle is (k * 180/n). \n\n   However, wait: the formula was (arc_length * 180/n) = (k * 180/n). \n\n   Step 4: But note: there are two possibilities: sometimes two different k (k and n-k) might yield the same absolute difference? \n\n   Actually, we are to minimize |angle - a|, and the angle is (k * 180/n). \n\n   But note: k and n-k give two different angles: \n        k: angle = (k * 180/n)\n        n-k: angle = ((n-k) * 180/n)\n\n   And these are two different angles unless k = n/2.\n\n   However, note: the arc k and arc n-k are complementary. But the angle is defined by the intercepted arc (the one not containing v2). \n\n   But wait: the inscribed angle formula uses the intercepted arc (the one not containing v2). So if we choose k, we are fixing the intercepted arc. \n\n   But note: the same angle can be achieved by two different k? \n\n   Example: k and n-k might be symmetric? \n\n   However, the angle for k is (k * 180/n) and for n-k is ((n-k)*180/n). These are different.\n\n   Therefore, we must consider k from 1 to n-1.\n\n   But note: k and n-k are two different arcs. The angle for k is (k * 180/n) and for n-k is ((n-k)*180/n). \n\n   However, observe: the inscribed angle for the arc k is the same as the inscribed angle for the arc n-k? \n\n   Actually, no. \n\n   But wait: the inscribed angle is defined by the intercepted arc. The intercepted arc is k, then the angle is (k * 180/n). \n\n   There is no direct relation between k and n-k in the formula.\n\n   However, note: the entire circle is 360. The intercepted arc k and the intercepted arc n-k are two different arcs.\n\n   But wait: the angle at v2 can also be considered by the other arc? \n\n   Actually, no: the formula uses the intercepted arc (the one not containing v2). \n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex polygon such that the angle formed at one of the vertices is as close as possible to a given target angle. The solution involves leveraging geometric properties of regular polygons and minimizing the absolute difference between the computed angle and the target angle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires finding three vertices (v1, v2, v3) in a regular convex polygon with `n` sides such that the angle formed at vertex `v2` by the points `v1` and `v3` is closest to the given angle `a`. The key insight is that the angle at any vertex in such a polygon can be derived from the intercepted arc opposite to it. Specifically, the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc (in degrees).\n\n2. **Geometric Insight**: For a regular `n`-sided polygon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is `360/n` degrees. The angle formed at a vertex `v2` by points `v1` and `v3` is determined by the arc between `v1` and `v3` that does not contain `v2`. This arc's measure in degrees is `(k * 360 / n)`, where `k` is the number of edges in the intercepted arc. The inscribed angle at `v2` is then `(k * 180 / n)` degrees.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves:\n   - **Finding the Optimal Arc Length (`k`)**: Calculate all possible angles (for `k` ranging from 1 to `n-1`) and select the `k` that minimizes the absolute difference between `(k * 180 / n)` and `a`.\n   - **Constructing the Vertex Triplet**: Once the optimal `k` is found, determine the vertices `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` such that the intercepted arc between `v1` and `v3` (not containing `v2`) has exactly `k` edges. This involves selecting appropriate vertices based on the fixed vertex `v2` and the arc length `k`.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently checks all possible arc lengths (`k` from 1 to `n-1`) in linear time, making it suitable for large `n` (up to 10^5). The construction of the vertex triplet is done in constant time once the optimal `k` is identified.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = int(data[1])\n    \n    best_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = None\n    \n    for k in range(1, n):\n        angle_val = (k * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle_val - a)\n        if diff < best_diff:\n            best_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n            \n    if best_k is None:\n        best_k = 1\n        \n    mid_vertex = 1\n    arc_length = best_k\n    \n    total_edges = n\n    \n    if arc_length == total_edges - arc_length:\n        start = (mid_vertex + arc_length // 2) % n\n        end = (start + arc_length) % n\n        v1 = start\n        v3 = end\n        v2 = mid_vertex\n        print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n    else:\n        side1 = arc_length\n        side2 = total_edges - arc_length\n        \n        if side1 < side2:\n            start = (mid_vertex + side1 // 2) % n\n            v1 = start\n            v3 = (start + side1) % n\n            v2 = mid_vertex\n            print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n        else:\n            start = (mid_vertex - side2 // 2) % n\n            if start < 0:\n                start += n\n            v1 = start\n            v3 = (start + side2) % n\n            v2 = mid_vertex\n            print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (target angle).\n2. **Finding Optimal Arc Length (`k`)**: The loop iterates over all possible arc lengths from 1 to `n-1`, computes the corresponding angle, and keeps track of the arc length that minimizes the absolute difference with the target angle `a`.\n3. **Constructing Vertex Triplet**: Depending on whether the optimal arc length `k` is symmetric (i.e., `k = n - k`), the code selects vertices `v1` and `v3` such that the intercepted arc between them (excluding `v2`) has exactly `k` edges. The vertices are chosen by adjusting their positions around the polygon to ensure the correct arc length.\n4. **Output**: The selected vertices are printed in the required format, ensuring the angle formed at `v2` is closest to the target angle `a`.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the optimal solution by leveraging geometric properties and ensures correctness by systematically checking all feasible arc lengths and constructing valid vertex triplets.",
