The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to use the condition: a_i + b_j is odd => (a_i % 2) != (b_j % 2)\n Therefore, we can separate the chests and keys by their parity.\n\n Let:\n   Chestes_even = number of chests with a_i even\n   Chestes_odd = number of chests with a_i odd\n\n   Keys_even = number of keys with b_j even\n   Keys_odd = number of keys with b_j odd\n\n Now, note that an even chest can only be opened by an odd key, and an odd chest can only be opened by an even key.\n\n So, we have two bipartite graphs (or two independent matching problems):\n\n 1. Even keys -> Odd chests: \n    But wait, actually: \n        - Even chest requires odd key.\n        - Odd chest requires even key.\n\n However, note the condition: \n        a_i (chest) + b_j (key) is odd.\n\n This means:\n        If a_i is even, then b_j must be odd (since even + odd = odd).\n        If a_i is odd, then b_j must be even (since odd + even = odd).\n\n Therefore, we can form two sets:\n\n   Set A: chests with even numbers -> require keys from set B (odd keys)\n   Set C: chests with odd numbers -> require keys from set D (even keys)\n\n And we have two sets of keys: even keys (set D) and odd keys (set B).\n\n But note: the same key cannot be used twice.\n\n So, we can model this as:\n\n   We want to match as many even-chests as possible with odd-keys, and as many odd-chests as possible with even-keys.\n\n However, the catch: the total number of keys available for even-chests is the count of odd-keys, and for odd-chests is the count of even-keys.\n\n But we cannot use the same key in two different chests.\n\n Actually, we have two independent bipartite graphs:\n\n   Graph 1: between even-chests and odd-keys (edges: all pairs since any even-chest with any odd-key satisfies the condition)\n   Graph 2: between odd-chests and even-keys.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require that we use the same key for two different chests. The maximum matching in each graph is simply the minimum of the two node sets (because it's a complete bipartite graph for each part).\n\n But wait: we are limited by the total number of keys in each category.\n\n However, there is no sharing between the two graphs? Actually, the keys are partitioned: odd-keys are only used for even-chests, and even-keys for odd-chests.\n\n Therefore, the maximum chests we can open is:\n\n   min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\n But let's test with the examples.\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: n=5, m=4, chests = [9,14,6,2,11], keys = [8,4,7,20]\n\n   Chests: \n        9 -> odd, 14->even, 6->even, 2->even, 11->odd\n        even_chests = 3, odd_chests = 2\n\n   Keys:\n        8->even, 4->even, 7->odd, 20->even\n        even_keys = 3, odd_keys = 1\n\n   Then, according to the formula:\n        min(3, 1) + min(2, 3) = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n   Example output is 3. So it matches.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: 5 1\n          2 4 6 8 10\n          5\n\n   Chests: all even -> even_chests=5, odd_chests=0\n   Keys: [5] -> odd_keys=1, even_keys=0\n\n   Formula: min(5,1) + min(0,0) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n   Example output is 1.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: 1 4\n           10\n           20 30 40 50\n\n   Chests: [10] -> even_chest=1, odd_chest=0\n   Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> even_keys=4, odd_keys=0\n\n   Formula: min(1,0) + min(0,4) = 0+0 = 0.\n\n   Example output is 0.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   Step 1: Read n and m.\n   Step 2: Read the list of chests (n integers) and the list of keys (m integers).\n   Step 3: Count the number of even and odd in chests and keys.\n\n   Let:\n        even_chest = count of chests with a_i % 2 == 0\n        odd_chest = n - even_chest\n\n        even_key = count of keys with b_j % 2 == 0\n        odd_key = m - even_key\n\n   Step 4: result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n\n   Print the result.\n\n However, wait: is that really the case?\n\n Let me think: In the first example, we have 3 even-chests and 1 odd-key. We can only open 1 even-chest because we have only one odd-key. Then for the odd-chests (which are 2), we have 3 even-keys (which is more than enough). So we can open 2 odd-chests? \n\n But note: the condition for odd-chests requires even keys. We have 3 even-keys, so we can use up to 3 even-keys. However, we only have 2 odd-chests. So we can open at most 2 odd-chests. \n\n However, the total matching would be 1 (from even-chests) + 2 (from odd-chests) = 3.\n\n But wait, the keys are shared: we have a total of 4 keys: 3 even and 1 odd. The odd key is used for one even chest. Then we use the 3 even keys for the odd-chests. However, we only have two odd-chests, so we use two of the even keys. That leaves one even key unused.\n\n The formula uses the two independent matchings: \n     For even-chests: we are limited by the odd-keys (only 1 available) -> so we can open at most 1 even-chest.\n     For odd-chests: we are limited by the even-keys (3 available, but we only need 2 for the 2 odd-chests) -> so we can open all 2 odd-chests.\n\n Hence, the total is 3.\n\n Why is this correct? Because the two sets of keys (even and odd) are disjoint. Similarly, the two sets of chests (even and odd) are disjoint.\n\n Therefore, the two matchings do not interfere.\n\n But note: what if we had a situation where the same key could be used in two different ways? No, because the condition depends on the parity and the key is either even or odd. And the chest is either even or odd. So the key is fixed in the requirement.\n\n Therefore, the solution is straightforward.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their numbers is odd. This translates to matching even-numbered chests with odd-numbered keys and vice versa.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests and keys based on parity (even or odd). An even-numbered chest must be matched with an odd-numbered key, and an odd-numbered chest must be matched with an even-numbered key. Each key and chest can be used at most once.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves counting the number of even and odd numbered chests and keys separately. The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum between the number of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum between the number of odd chests and even keys.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Counting the number of even and odd chests.\n   - Counting the number of even and odd keys.\n   - Calculating the result as `min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)`.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution processes each chest and key exactly once, resulting in a linear time complexity O(n + m), where n is the number of chests and m is the number of keys. This is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests (n) and keys (m), followed by the numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Parities**: The code counts how many chests and keys are even or odd by checking each number's remainder when divided by 2.\n3. **Calculating Result**: The result is computed by taking the sum of the minimum values between even chests and odd keys, and between odd chests and even keys. This ensures we maximize the number of chests opened without reusing any key or chest.\n4. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the maximum number of chests Neko can open under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages parity checks and simple arithmetic to solve the problem within optimal time complexity.",
