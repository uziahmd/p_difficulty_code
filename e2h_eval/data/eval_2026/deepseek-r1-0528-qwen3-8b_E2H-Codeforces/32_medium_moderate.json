    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering that removing one element might help us avoid either the minimum or the maximum value.\n Since the instability is defined as (max - min), we note that if we remove an element, the new instability is:\n   max_remaining - min_remaining\n\n The key observation: \n   The original array has a global min (let's call it `min_val`) and global max (`max_val`).\n\n If we remove one element, then the new min and/or max might change.\n\n There are two main cases to consider when removing an element:\n\n Case 1: Removing an element that is the only occurrence of the current min (or one of many but we can consider the effect).\n   Then the new min will be the next smallest number (if there are multiple mins, then the min remains the same until we remove all of them? Actually, we remove exactly one. So if there are multiple mins, then removing one doesn't change the min).\n\n But note: We are allowed to remove exactly one element. Therefore, the candidate removals that can reduce the instability are those that are either the global min or the global max.\n\n However, we must consider that sometimes the array may have duplicates. So we cannot just remove the first occurrence of the min or the max.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let the sorted array be `b`.\n Then, the original instability is b[-1] - b[0].\n\n After removing one element, we have two possibilities for the instability:\n\n Possibility 1: Remove an element that is the current minimum (so the new array's min becomes the next smallest value, unless we remove the last occurrence of the min? Actually, we don't need to know the frequency. We can consider:\n\n   Option A: Consider removing an element at index i (0-indexed). Then the new instability is max(b without b[i]) - min(b without b[i]).\n\n But note: n can be up to 10^5, so we cannot try every removal.\n\n Insight:\n\n The instability of the array after removal is determined by the remaining min and remaining max.\n\n We note that the overall min and max of the entire array are fixed. However, if we remove an element, the new min is:\n   If we remove the current min, then the new min is the next smallest number (which is the next occurrence of the min if there are duplicates, or the next distinct value if not). Similarly for the max.\n\n Actually, we can consider:\n\n   Option 1: Remove an element that is the minimum -> then the new min might be the next distinct value (but wait, what if there are multiple mins? Then the min doesn't change. So the effect on the min is only if we remove the last occurrence of the min. Similarly for the max.\n\n However, note: We are allowed to remove exactly one. So if there are multiple mins, then removing one min doesn't change the min. Similarly, if we remove one max from multiple, the max doesn't change.\n\n Therefore, the instability only changes when we remove an element that is the unique min or the unique max?\n\n But wait, consider: [1, 2, 3, 4]. \n   Original instability: 4-1=3.\n   If we remove 1: instability becomes 4-2=2.\n   If we remove 4: instability becomes 3-1=2.\n   But if we remove 2: instability becomes 4-1=3.\n   If we remove 3: instability becomes 4-1=3.\n\n Now consider [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]:\n   Original instability: 4-1=3.\n   Removing one of the 1's: the min remains 1, so instability is 4-1=3.\n   Removing the other 1: same, 3.\n   Removing 2: 4-1=3.\n   Removing 3: 4-1=3.\n   Removing 4: 3-1=2.\n\n So the instability is minimized by removing the max (if there are duplicates of min, then removing the max is better).\n\n Therefore, we can think: the best removal is one of the following:\n\n   Candidate 1: Remove the smallest element (if there are multiple smallest, then removing one of them doesn't help in reducing the min, but might help if we remove a min that is also part of the extremes? Actually, we must consider the range of the entire array without one element.\n\n Another approach: \n\n   Sort the array: b[0] <= b[1] <= ... <= b[n-1]\n\n   Then, note: the instability of the entire array is b[n-1]-b[0].\n\n   When we remove an element, we have two types of arrays:\n\n   Type 1: The array without the first element (b[0]). Then the new min is b[1] (if we remove the first) and the max is still b[n-1] (unless we remove the last occurrence of the max, but note the array is sorted so the max is at the end). Actually, the max remains unless we remove the last element.\n\n   However, we can consider two kinds of removals:\n\n   Removal at the beginning: then the new instability is b[n-1] - b[1]\n   Removal at the end: then the new instability is b[n-2] - b[0]\n\n   But what about removal in the middle?\n\n   Consider: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. \n      Remove the first: instability = 5-2=3.\n      Remove the last: instability = 4-1=3.\n      Remove the middle: say remove 3 -> [1,2,4,5]: instability=5-1=4 -> worse.\n\n   However, consider [1, 2, 100, 101, 102] (with a big gap). \n      Original: 102-1=101.\n      Removing 1: 102-2=100.\n      Removing 102: 101-1=100.\n      Removing 2: 102-1=101 -> same as original.\n      Removing 100: 102-1=101 -> same.\n      Removing 101: 102-1=101.\n\n   So the best is 100.\n\n   But note: the above example shows that we should consider removals at the ends.\n\n   Now consider [1, 2, 3, 100, 101, 102] (with a gap in the middle). \n      Original: 102-1=101.\n      Removing 1: 102-2=100.\n      Removing 102: 101-1=100.\n      Removing 2: 102-1=101.\n      Removing 3: 102-1=101.\n      Removing 100: 102-1=101.\n      Removing 101: 102-1=101.\n\n   So the best is 100.\n\n   It appears that the best removal is either removing the first element or the last element.\n\n   Why? Because the instability is defined by the entire range. Removing an element that is not at the ends doesn't change the min or the max (if the min or max is still present). And if we remove an element that is the min, then the new min becomes the next smallest (which is the second smallest, i.e., the first element of the sorted array without the first element). Similarly for the max.\n\n   However, what if we have an array with two distinct values? [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3] (n=6)\n        Original: 3-1=2.\n        Removing the first (1): [2,2,2,2,3] -> instability 3-2=1.\n        Removing the last (3): [1,2,2,2,2] -> instability 2-1=1.\n\n        But note: there are multiple 2's. What if we remove a 2? Then the array becomes [1,2,2,2,3] or [1,2,2,2,3] (same) -> instability 3-1=2.\n\n   So the best removals are the ones at the ends.\n\n   But wait: what if we have an array with only two elements? [1, 2] -> removing one leaves [2] or [1]. Then the instability is 0 in both cases. But according to our method: \n        sorted: [1,2]\n        Remove first: [2] -> instability 2-2=0.\n        Remove last: [1] -> instability 1-1=0.\n\n   So the answer is 0.\n\n   However, consider three elements: [1, 2, 3]\n        Removing first: [2,3] -> 3-2=1.\n        Removing last: [1,2] -> 2-1=1.\n        Removing middle: [1,3] -> 3-1=2.\n\n   So the best is 1.\n\n   So we see that the best instability we can get by removing one element is the minimum over:\n\n        candidate1: b[n-1] - b[1]   (remove the first element, then the new min is b[1])\n        candidate2: b[n-2] - b[0]   (remove the last element, then the new max is b[n-2])\n\n   But wait: what about arrays with more than two distinct numbers? Consider [1, 2, 3, 4] -> \n        candidate1: remove first: 4-2=2.\n        candidate2: remove last: 3-1=2.\n\n   That matches.\n\n   However, consider [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:\n        candidate1: remove first: 5-2=3.\n        candidate2: remove last: 4-1=3.\n\n   But note: what if we remove an element that is not the first or last? Then we might get an instability that is less than both candidate1 and candidate2? \n\n   Example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> removing the middle (3) gives [1,2,4,5] -> instability 5-1=4, which is worse.\n\n   But what if we have an array like [1, 2, 3, 100, 101, 102]? \n        candidate1: remove first: 102-2=100.\n        candidate2: remove last: 101-1=100.\n\n   Now consider if we remove an element in the middle that is part of the \"gap\" but not the min or max. For example, remove 100: \n        Array becomes [1,2,3,101,102] -> instability 102-1=101, which is worse.\n\n   So the above two candidates (removing the first or the last) are the only ones that can potentially reduce the instability.\n\n   However, wait: what if the array has duplicates and the min or max is repeated? \n\n   Example: [1, 1, 2, 3] \n        Original instability: 3-1=2.\n        Removing the first 1: [1,2,3] -> 3-1=2.\n        Removing the last 1: [1,2,3] -> 3-1=2.\n        Removing 2: [1,1,3] -> 3-1=2.\n        Removing 3: [1,1,2] -> 2-1=1.\n\n   Here, removing the last element (which is the max) gives a better result. But note: in this case, the last element is 3, and the array is sorted: [1,1,2,3]. \n        candidate1: remove first element (the first 1) -> [1,2,3]: instability 3-1=2.\n        candidate2: remove last element (3) -> [1,1,2]: instability 2-1=1.\n\n   So candidate2 is the best.\n\n   But what if we remove the second 1 (which is the second element)? Then we get [1,2,3] -> instability 2.\n\n   So we see that the above two candidates are:\n\n        candidate1: remove the smallest element (but note: if there are multiple smallest, then removing one of them might not change the min if there is another smallest. So the new min would still be the smallest. Then the instability is (max) - (min) which is unchanged.\n\n        candidate2: similarly.\n\n   Therefore, we must consider: \n\n        We want to consider removals that might change the min or the max.\n\n        The min can only change if we remove the only occurrence of the smallest element. Similarly, the max can only change if we remove the only occurrence of the largest.\n\n        However, note: if we remove an element that is the smallest, but there are multiple smallest, then the min remains the same. Then the instability becomes (max) - (min) [unchanged]. \n\n        Similarly, if we remove the largest and there are multiple largest, then the max remains the same and the instability is (max) - (min) [unchanged].\n\n        But if we remove an element that is the smallest and it was the only one, then the new min is the next distinct smallest (which is the second smallest). Similarly for the max.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n        Let the sorted array be `b`.\n\n        We can consider two scenarios:\n\n          Scenario A: The removed element is the smallest (and it is the only smallest) -> then the new min is b[1] (if n>=2, then the next element). Then the instability is b[n-1] - b[1].\n\n          Scenario B: The removed element is the largest (and it is the only largest) -> then the new max is b[n-2], so instability is b[n-2] - b[0].\n\n        But what if we remove an element that is neither the smallest nor the largest? Then the min and max remain the same, so the instability remains b[n-1]-b[0]. \n\n        However, note: sometimes removing an element in the middle might allow the min or max to change? Only if the element we remove is the only occurrence of the min or max. Otherwise, the min and max stay.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal instability we can achieve is the minimum among:\n\n          candidate1: b[n-1] - b[1]   (if we remove the first element, then the min becomes b[1] and the max remains b[n-1])\n          candidate2: b[n-2] - b[0]   (if we remove the last element, then the max becomes b[n-2] and the min remains b[0])\n\n        But wait: what if we remove an element that is the smallest but not the first? For example, if the array is [1,2,3,4] and we remove the first 1, then the min becomes 2. But if the array is [1,1,2,3] and we remove the second 1 (at index1), then the min remains 1. \n\n        However, note: the sorted array is [1,1,2,3]. The smallest element is 1 and appears twice. Removing any 1 does not change the min. Then the instability is 3-1=2, which is the same as the original.\n\n        So the candidate1 and candidate2 above are valid only if the removal changes the min or max. \n\n        Actually, we can consider:\n\n          The instability after removal is the difference between the maximum and minimum of the remaining array.\n\n          The remaining array's min is:\n            If we remove an element that is the smallest and it was the only smallest, then min becomes the next smallest (which is the next distinct value, but in sorted order, the next smallest is the next element, which might be the same if duplicates exist? Actually, no: the next element might be the same. But if we remove one occurrence of the smallest, and there are duplicates, then the smallest remains. \n\n          Therefore, we can break down:\n\n          Let the array be sorted: b[0] <= b[1] <= ... <= b[n-1]\n\n          The effect of removing an element at position i (0<=i<n) is:\n\n            new_min = \n                if i==0 and b[0] < b[1] then b[1] (because we removed the only smallest) \n                else if b[0] == b[i] and i is the last index of the smallest? Actually, we don't know the frequency.\n\n          Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n          The new min is:\n            if we remove an element that is the smallest and there is no other smallest, then the new min is the next distinct value (which is the first element that is greater than the smallest). But note: the smallest might repeat.\n\n          Actually, we can compute:\n\n          Let m1 = b[0] (min) and M1 = b[-1] (max)\n\n          The new min is:\n            if we remove an element that is the smallest and there is no duplicate of the smallest (i.e., the smallest appears only once), then the new min is the next distinct value (b[1]), otherwise (if there are duplicates) the new min is still the smallest.\n\n          Similarly, the new max is:\n            if we remove an element that is the largest and it is the only largest, then the new max is the previous distinct value (b[-2]), otherwise the max remains.\n\n          But note: we are allowed to remove only one element. So we can try to remove each distinct value that is either the smallest or the largest and see the effect.\n\n          However, we can also consider: \n\n          The best instability is the minimum of:\n\n            candidate1: M1 - b[1]   (this candidate corresponds to removing the first occurrence of the smallest, but only if the smallest is unique? Actually, if the smallest is not unique, then removing one smallest doesn't change the min, so the instability is M1 - b[0] (which is the original) and that is not better than candidate1. But wait, candidate1 is defined as M1 - b[1] (which is assuming we remove the first smallest and then the min becomes b[1]). This candidate is only valid if we remove an element that is the smallest and the smallest is unique? Actually, no: even if the smallest is duplicated, removing the first smallest (at index0) leaves the smallest still at index0 (if there's another one) so the min remains b[0]. \n\n          Therefore, we cannot simply use candidate1 and candidate2 as defined above.\n\n        Let me reframe:\n\n          We are allowed to remove exactly one element. The goal is to minimize (max - min) of the remaining array.\n\n          The remaining array's min and max can be:\n\n            min_remaining = \n                if we remove an element that is the smallest and there is no other smallest (i.e., the smallest appears only once) then the next smallest value (which is b[1] if the array is sorted and the smallest is unique) OR if there are duplicates, then the smallest remains until we remove all of them.\n\n          Actually, we can consider the following:\n\n          Let L = b[0] and R = b[-1]\n\n          The instability of the entire array is R-L.\n\n          We can get a smaller instability if we remove an element that is either L or R (and if they are unique, then the min or max changes).\n\n          But note: if we remove an element that is not L or R, then the min and max remain L and R, so the instability remains R-L.\n\n          So the best we can do is to remove either L or R (if they are unique) and then the instability becomes:\n\n            If we remove L and L is unique: then the new min is the next smallest value (which is the first element that is greater than L). In the sorted array, the next smallest value is b[1] (if L is unique, then b[1] > L). Then the instability is R - b[1].\n            If we remove L and L is not unique: then the min remains L, so the instability is R - L (same as original).\n\n            Similarly, if we remove R and R is unique: then the new max is b[-2], so instability is b[-2] - L.\n            If we remove R and R is not unique: then the max remains R, so the instability is R - L.\n\n          Therefore, the best instability we can get by removing one element is the minimum of:\n\n            candidate_remove_min = \n                if the first occurrence of L is the last occurrence (i.e., the smallest is unique) then (R - b[1])\n                else (R - L)   [because removing one L doesn't change the min]\n\n            candidate_remove_max = \n                if the last occurrence of R is the first occurrence (i.e., the largest is unique) then (b[-2] - L)\n                else (R - L)\n\n          However, note: we are allowed to remove any one element. We don't necessarily have to remove the smallest or the largest. But note: if we remove an element that is not the smallest or the largest, the instability remains R-L. And if we remove the smallest (even if duplicated) the instability remains R-L (since the min doesn't change). Similarly for the largest.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal instability we can get is:\n\n            min( R - L,   # if we remove an element that is not the smallest or largest, or if we remove a duplicate of the smallest or largest, we get this or worse?\n                 (if smallest is unique: R - b[1] else R-L),\n                 (if largest is unique: b[-2] - L else R-L) )\n\n          But wait: if the smallest is unique, then removing it gives instability R-b[1] (which is <= R-L because b[1]>=L). Similarly, if the largest is unique, then removing it gives b[-2]-L (<= R-L). \n\n          Therefore, we can write:\n\n            ans = min( \n                      (R - L), \n                      (R - b[1]) if (b[0] != b[1]) else (R - L),   # But wait, if the smallest is not unique, then removing the smallest doesn't change the min, so we cannot use R - b[1] because that would be incorrect. Actually, we must consider: we can only remove one element. The best removals are:\n\n            Actually, we don't need to condition on uniqueness of the smallest and largest separately. We can consider:\n\n            candidate1 = R - b[1]   (if we remove the first occurrence, then the new min is b[1] only if the element we remove is the smallest and there is no other smallest? Actually, no: if we remove an element that is the smallest, then the new min is the smallest among the remaining, which is the next distinct value (if the smallest is unique) or the same (if not). But note: we are allowed to remove any element. So we can remove the first occurrence of the smallest (which is at index0) and then the new min is the smallest value in the remaining array. \n\n            However, the remaining array's min is the smallest value in the set excluding the removed element. \n\n            How to compute the min and max of the remaining array without knowing which element we remove?\n\n            We can consider:\n\n            Let the array be sorted. Then:\n\n            If we remove an element that is not the smallest, the min remains b[0].\n            If we remove the smallest and it is the only smallest, then the min becomes b[1]; if there are multiple smallest, then the min remains b[0].\n\n            Similarly for the max.\n\n            Therefore, the instability after removal is:\n\n              min_remaining = \n                  if the removed element is the smallest and there is no other smallest (i.e., the count of the smallest is 1) then b[1] else b[0]\n\n              max_remaining = \n                  if the removed element is the largest and there is no other largest (i.e., the count of the largest is 1) then b[-2] else b[-1]\n\n            Then the instability is max_remaining - min_remaining.\n\n            But note: we don't know which element we remove. However, we are free to choose one element. So we can choose to remove:\n\n              Option 1: an element that is not the smallest and not the largest -> then min_remaining = b[0], max_remaining = b[-1] -> instability = R - L.\n\n              Option 2: remove an element that is the smallest but not the only smallest -> then min_remaining = b[0], max_remaining = b[-1] -> instability = R - L.\n\n              Option 3: remove an element that is the smallest and it is the only smallest -> then min_remaining = b[1], max_remaining = b[-1] -> instability = R - b[1].\n\n              Option 4: remove an element that is the largest and it is not the only largest -> then min_remaining = b[0], max_remaining = b[-1] -> instability = R - L.\n\n              Option 5: remove an element that is the largest and it is the only largest -> then min_remaining = b[0], max_remaining = b[-2] -> instability = b[-2] - b[0].\n\n            Therefore, the minimal instability is the minimum of:\n\n              R - L   (from options 1,2,4)\n              R - b[1] (from option 3, provided that the smallest is unique)\n              b[-2] - b[0] (from option 5, provided that the largest is unique)\n\n            But note: we don't know if the smallest is unique or the largest is unique. We can check:\n\n              smallest is unique: if b[0] < b[1] (then the first occurrence is the only smallest)\n              largest is unique: if b[-1] > b[-2] (then the last occurrence is the only largest)\n\n            However, what if the array has more than two distinct numbers? The above conditions are sufficient.\n\n            Therefore, we can compute:\n\n              candidate1 = R - b[1] if b[0] < b[1] else R - b[0]   [But wait, if smallest is not unique, then removing the smallest doesn't change the min, so we cannot get R - b[1] by removing the smallest? Actually, we can get R - b[1] only if we remove the smallest and the smallest is unique. But note: we can also remove an element that is not the smallest to get the same instability? No, because if we remove an element that is not the smallest, the min remains b[0] (so the instability is R - b[0]). \n\n            Actually, we are allowed to remove any element. The minimal instability we can get is:\n\n              candidate1: if we remove the smallest and it is unique, then we get R - b[1]\n              candidate2: if we remove the largest and it is unique, then we get b[-2] - b[0]\n\n            But note: we can also remove an element that is not the smallest or largest and get R - b[0] (which is the original). However, we are looking for the minimum.\n\n            So we can compute:\n\n              ans = min( \n                         R - L, \n                         (R - b[1]) if (b[0] < b[1]) else float('inf'), \n                         (b[-2] - L) if (b[-1] > b[-2]) else float('inf')\n                     )\n\n            However, wait: what if the array is [1,2,3,4] (all distinct)? Then:\n\n              candidate1: R - b[1] = 4-2=2\n              candidate2: b[-2]-L = 3-1=2\n              candidate3: R-L=3\n\n              Then ans = min(3,2,2)=2.\n\n            But what if the array is [1,2,2,3]?\n\n              sorted: [1,2,2,3]\n              smallest is unique? 1 < 2 -> yes, so candidate1: R - b[1] = 3-2=1.\n              largest is unique? 3>2 -> yes, so candidate2: b[-2]-L = 2-1=1.\n              candidate3: R-L=3-1=2.\n\n              Then ans = min(2,1,1)=1.\n\n            But let's verify by actually removing:\n\n              Remove the smallest (1): [2,2,3] -> instability 3-2=1 -> matches candidate1.\n              Remove the largest (3): [1,2,2] -> instability 2-1=1 -> matches candidate2.\n\n            But note: the original instability is 2. Removing an element that is not the smallest or largest: remove a 2 -> [1,2,3] -> instability 3-1=2.\n\n            So the minimal instability is 1.\n\n            Now, what if the array is [1,1,2,3]?\n\n              sorted: [1,1,2,3]\n              smallest is unique? 1==1 -> no, so candidate1 is not considered (we set to inf).\n              largest is unique? 3>2 -> yes, so candidate2: 2-1=1.\n              candidate3: 3-1=2.\n\n              Then ans = min(2, inf, 1)=1.\n\n            Let's verify: \n              Remove the smallest (one of the 1's): [1,2,3] -> instability 3-1=2.\n              Remove the largest: [1,1,2] -> instability 2-1=1.\n\n            So the minimal is 1.\n\n            But wait: what if we remove an element that is not the smallest and not the largest? We can remove the 2: [1,1,3] -> instability 3-1=2.\n\n            So the above formula works.\n\n            However, note: the above conditions for candidate1 and candidate2 are based on the uniqueness of the smallest and largest. \n\n            But what if the array is [1,2,3,4,5] (all distinct)? Then:\n\n              candidate1: 5-2=3\n              candidate2: 4-1=3\n              candidate3: 5-1=4\n              Then ans = 3.\n\n            But wait, in [1,2,3,4,5] we can remove the first element: then [2,3,4,5] -> instability 5-2=3.\n            Or remove the last: [1,2,3,4] -> 4-1=3.\n\n            But what if we remove an element from the middle? \n              Remove 3: [1,2,4,5] -> 5-1=4.\n              Remove 2: [1,3,4,5] -> 5-1=4.\n              Remove 4: [1,2,3,5] -> 5-1=4.\n\n            So the minimal is 3.\n\n            Now, what if the array has one element? But n>=2.\n\n            Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n              Read n\n              Read list a of n integers.\n\n              Sort the list.\n\n              Let L = a[0], R = a[-1]\n\n              candidate1 = float('inf')\n              candidate2 = float('inf')\n\n              # Check smallest uniqueness: if the first element is strictly less than the second, then the smallest is unique.\n              if n >= 2:\n                  if a[0] < a[1]:\n                      candidate1 = R - a[1]\n                  else:\n                      # smallest is not unique, so removing one smallest doesn't change the min\n                      candidate1 = float('inf')\n\n                  if a[-1] > a[-2]:\n                      candidate2 = a[-2] - L\n                  else:\n                      candidate2 = float('inf')\n\n              ans = min(R - L, candidate1, candidate2)\n\n            However, wait: what if n==2? Then the array has two elements.\n\n            Example: [1,2] (n=2)\n              candidate1: a[0]=1 < a[1]=2 -> true, candidate1 = 2-2=0? Wait, no: R = 2, a[1]=2 -> candidate1 = 2-2=0.\n              candidate2: a[-1]=2 > a[-2]=1 -> true, candidate2 = 1-1=0.\n\n              Then ans = min(2-1, 0, 0)=0. Correct.\n\n            Example: [1,1] (n=2)\n              candidate1: a[0]==a[1] -> false, so candidate1=inf.\n              candidate2: a[-1]==a[-2] -> false, so candidate2=inf.\n              Then ans = min(1-1, inf, inf)=0.\n\n            But wait, [1,1] -> removing one element leaves [1] -> instability 0. Correct.\n\n            However, note: in the example [1,1] the original instability is 0. Removing one element: the instability is 0. So the answer is 0.\n\n            But wait: what if we have [1,2,3] (n=3)?\n\n              candidate1: a[0]=1 < a[1]=2 -> true, candidate1 = 3-2=1.\n              candidate2: a[-1]=3 > a[-2]=2 -> true, candidate2 = 2-1=1.\n              Then ans = min(3-1=2, 1, 1)=1.\n\n            Correct.\n\n            But wait, what if we have [1,2,2,3] (as above) -> we got 1, which is correct.\n\n            However, note: the above candidate1 and candidate2 are computed only when the smallest or largest is unique. But what if the array is [1,2,3,3]?\n\n              sorted: [1,2,3,3]\n              smallest is unique: 1<2 -> true, candidate1 = 3-2=1.\n              largest is unique: 3==3 -> false, candidate2 = inf.\n              Then ans = min(3-1=2, 1, inf)=1.\n\n            Let's verify: \n              Remove the smallest (1): [2,3,3] -> instability 3-2=1 -> correct.\n              Remove the largest (one of the 3's): [1,2,3] -> instability 3-1=2.\n              Remove the 2: [1,3,3] -> 3-1=2.\n              Remove the other 3: same as above.\n\n            So the minimal is 1.\n\n            But wait, the above candidate1 is 1, which is correct.\n\n            However, note: the candidate1 is computed as R - a[1] (which is 3-2=1). But the new min is 2 (since we removed the smallest) and the max is 3 (remains) -> 3-2=1.\n\n            This matches.\n\n            But wait: what if the array is [1,2,3,4] (all distinct) -> n=4.\n\n              candidate1: 4-2=2.\n              candidate2: 3-1=2.\n              Then ans = min(3,2,2)=2.\n\n            Correct.\n\n            But wait, consider [1,2,3,4,5] (n=5):\n\n              candidate1: 5-2=3.\n              candidate2: 4-1=3.\n              Then ans = min(4,3,3)=3.\n\n            Correct.\n\n            However, wait: why did we use the entire array's min and max in the base candidate (R-L)? \n\n            Actually, note: we are allowed to remove any one element. The base candidate is the worst-case scenario (removing an element that doesn't change the min or max) which is the original instability. Then we consider if by removing the smallest (if unique) or the largest (if unique) we can get a better instability.\n\n            Therefore, the code:\n\n              n = int(input().strip())\n              a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n              a.sort()\n              L = a[0]\n              R = a[-1]\n\n              # If the array has only two distinct numbers, but more than two elements, we still use the above.\n\n              # Check for smallest uniqueness: \n              if n == 2:\n                  # Then we have two elements.\n                  # But we can handle with the general code below, but let's make sure.\n                  pass\n\n              candidate1 = float('inf')\n              candidate2 = float('inf')\n\n              if n > 1:\n                  # Check smallest: if the first element is less than the second, then smallest is unique.\n                  if a[0] < a[1]:\n                      candidate1 = R - a[1]\n                  # Else, smallest is not unique, so removing one smallest doesn't change the min.\n\n                  if a[-1] > a[-2]:\n                      candidate2 = a[-2] - L\n\n              ans = min(R - L, candidate1, candidate2)\n\n            Print(ans)\n\n            Let me test with the examples from the problem:\n\n            Example 1: Input \"4\\n1 3 3 7\"\n                n=4, a=[1,3,3,7] -> sorted [1,3,3,7]\n                L=1, R=7\n                candidate1: 1<3 -> True, candidate1 = 7-3",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the minimal instability is achieved by either removing the smallest unique element or the largest unique element from the array. Removing these elements potentially reduces the range (difference between max and min) of the remaining array. If the smallest or largest element is duplicated, removing one occurrence does not change the min or max, so the instability remains the same as the original array.\n2. **Intuition**: By sorting the array, we can easily access the smallest and largest elements. We then check if these elements are unique. If they are, removing them will reduce the instability; otherwise, the best we can do is keep the original instability.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily identify the smallest and largest elements.\n   - **Candidate Calculation**: Calculate two candidate values:\n     - **Candidate1**: The instability after removing the smallest unique element (if it exists).\n     - **Candidate2**: The instability after removing the largest unique element (if it exists).\n   - **Result Calculation**: The answer is the minimum among the original instability and the two candidates.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    L = a[0]\n    R = a[-1]\n    \n    candidate1 = float('inf')\n    candidate2 = float('inf')\n    \n    if n > 1:\n        if a[0] < a[1]:\n            candidate1 = R - a[1]\n        if a[-1] > a[-2]:\n            candidate2 = a[-2] - L\n            \n    ans = min(R - L, candidate1, candidate2)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.\n2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the smallest (`L`) and largest (`R`) elements.\n3. **Candidate Calculation**:\n   - **Candidate1**: If the smallest element is unique (i.e., `a[0] < a[1]`), the instability after removal is `R - a[1]`.\n   - **Candidate2**: If the largest element is unique (i.e., `a[-1] > a[-2]`), the instability after removal is `a[-2] - L`.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The answer is the minimum value among the original instability (`R - L`), Candidate1, and Candidate2. This ensures we consider all possible scenarios where removing one element could minimize the instability.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the minimal instability achievable by removing exactly one element from the array. \n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking only the relevant candidates, leveraging sorting and simple comparisons to determine the optimal solution.",
