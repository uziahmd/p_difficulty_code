She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n We need to leave only the tabs from l to r. Initially, all tabs [1, n] are open and cursor is at `pos`.\n\n Operations allowed:\n  - Move cursor left: from i to max(a, i-1) where a is the current minimum index (initially 1, but changes as we close tabs)\n  - Move cursor right: from i to min(b, i+1) where b is the current maximum index.\n  - Close all tabs to the left of the cursor: this sets the new minimum a to be the cursor's current position (but note: the cursor remains at the same tab, and the segment becomes [current cursor, b])\n  - Close all tabs to the right of the cursor: sets the new maximum b to be the cursor's current position.\n\n However, note that after closing some tabs, the boundaries a and b change. But observe: we are only concerned with leaving tabs [l, r]. So we must close:\n   - All tabs with index < l (from the left)\n   - All tabs with index > r (from the right)\n\n The idea is that we can close the left part and the right part separately. There are two main ways:\n\n Option 1: \n   - First, move the cursor to l (if needed) and then close the left part (which will remove everything from the current boundary to the left until l).\n   - Then, move the cursor to r (if needed) and close the right part.\n\n But note: we might also consider closing the right part first, then the left.\n\n However, sometimes we can do both in one go? Actually, note that when we close the left part, we set the left boundary to the current cursor (which must be at least l) and similarly for the right.\n\n Alternatively, we can think about what parts need to be closed.\n\n There are two intervals to close: [1, l-1] and [r+1, n].\n\n Steps:\n\n Case 1: If the entire range [1, n] is already [l, r] (i.e., l == 1 and r == n), then we don't need to do anything.\n\n Case 2: Otherwise, we have to close either the left side or the right side or both.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n If there is no left part to close (i.e., l == 1) and no right part (r == n), then answer is 0.\n\n Otherwise, we have to consider the movements and the two operations (closing left and closing right).\n\n Note: Each closing operation (left or right) is one second. And moving the cursor one step is one second.\n\n We have two main strategies:\n\n Strategy 1: Close the left part first, then the right part.\n   Steps:\n     1. Move the cursor to l (if it's not already at l). Time taken: |pos - l| seconds for movement.\n     2. Close the left part: 1 second.\n     3. Then, from l, we need to move to r (if r != l) to close the right part. But wait, after closing the left part, the left boundary is now l. Then we can move to r (which is at least l) and then close the right part.\n\n        However, note: after closing the left part, the current cursor is still at l. To close the right part, we need to be at a position from which we can close the right part (i.e., we need to move to at least r). But we can close the right part only if we are at a position that is beyond r? Actually, the operation \"close all tabs to the right\" closes from [current cursor+1, b]. So we must be at a position <= r (because we want to leave r). However, we must be at a position such that the cursor is at the left of the part we wish to close. But note: we want to leave [l, r]. To close the right, we must be at a tab that is at most r (so that the next tab is r+1, which is to be closed). \n\n        Actually, the problem states: \"close all the tabs to the right of the cursor\", meaning from [cursor+1, b]. So to close [r+1, n] we must have the cursor at r (then we close from [r+1, b]). \n\n        Therefore, we must move from l to r (if l < r) and then close the right part.\n\n        Time for this strategy: |pos - l| + 1 (for closing left) + |l - r| + 1 (for closing right) = |pos-l| + |l-r| + 2.\n\n Strategy 2: Close the right part first, then the left part.\n   Steps",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] while starting from a given cursor position. The solution involves analyzing the initial and target segments and deciding the optimal sequence of operations to minimize the time taken.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - Luba can move the cursor left or right one tab per second.\n   - She can close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor in one second each.\n   - The goal is to leave only the tabs within [l, r] open.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - If the entire range [1, n] is already within [l, r], no operations are needed (answer is 0).\n   - Otherwise, the solution involves either:\n     - Moving the cursor to `l` and closing all tabs to the left (if any), then moving to `r` and closing all tabs to the right (if any).\n     - Or vice versa (closing right first then left).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - Calculate the time required for both strategies (closing left first or right first) and choose the minimum between them.\n   - The time for moving the cursor is the absolute difference between the current position and the target position (either `l` or `r`).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - The solution involves simple arithmetic operations and comparisons, making it efficient with a constant time complexity O(1).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    pos = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    r = int(data[3])\n    \n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    option1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1\n    option2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1\n    \n    answer = min(option1, option2)\n    print(answer)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initial Check**: If the segment [1, n] matches [l, r], the answer is 0 because no operations are needed.\n- **Option 1 Calculation**: Time to move from `pos` to `l`, close all tabs left of `l`, then move to `r` and close all tabs right of `r`.\n- **Option 2 Calculation**: Time to move from `pos` to `r`, close all tabs right of `r`, then move to `l` and close all tabs left of `l`.\n- **Result**: The minimum time between Option 1 and Option 2 is chosen as the answer, ensuring the most efficient sequence of operations.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases by leveraging simple arithmetic and comparisons, providing the optimal solution in constant time.",
