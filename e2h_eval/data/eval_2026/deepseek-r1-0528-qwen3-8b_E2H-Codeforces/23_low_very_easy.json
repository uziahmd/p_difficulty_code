In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three tiles as input. The input is a single line containing three strings (each string is two characters: digit and suit letter). But note: the example input is given as ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p'] but actually the input format is one line with three space separated strings? Or wait, the example input is shown in a list of three strings, but the problem says \"The only line contains three strings\".\n\n Actually, looking at the example input: \n   Input: ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n This seems to be representing three test cases. However, the problem says:\n   \"The only line contains three strings\"\n\n But wait, the example output is ['0','0','1'] meaning three answers.\n\n Clarification from the problem statement: the input is one line with three strings (each string being a tile representation). However, the example input is shown as three separate strings in a list. But note: the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\" and then gives an example input. \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"Input: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\"\n\n So we can have one test case per run? Or multiple test cases?\n\n Let me read the problem again: \"The only line\" — so one line of input.\n\n But then the example input is shown as three examples. However, the problem is asking for the minimum number of extra tiles for her hand (which is three tiles). \n\n Since the problem states that she has three tiles, we can assume the input is three tiles. But wait, the example input is given as:\n\n Example 1: Input: \"1s 2s 3s\"\n Example 2: Input: \"9m 9m 9m\"\n Example 3: Input: \"3p 9m 2p\"\n\n But the example input format in the problem is written as a list of three strings. This might be confusing. \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\" \n\n So, for one test case, the input is three strings (each being a tile) on one line. However, the example output is three numbers (0,0,1). \n\n This suggests that the problem might be providing multiple test cases? But the problem says \"The only line\", so it must be one test case per run.\n\n But wait, the example input is provided as three separate examples. \n\n After re‐reading: the example input is:\n\n ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This is just showing three examples. The actual input for the program would be one of these lines.\n\n So the problem expects one test case per run.\n\n Steps:\n\n We have three tiles. We can consider two types of mentsu: koutsu (three identical) and shuntsu (three consecutive same suit).\n\n Since we start with three tiles, we can check if there is already a mentsu (either koutsu or shuntsu) in the hand.\n\n If yes, then answer is 0.\n\n Otherwise, we can draw one tile. Then we have four tiles. We need to check if we can form a mentsu with four tiles? But wait, note: the problem says \"she can draw any tiles\", and we are to find the minimum number.\n\n Possibilities:\n\n 0: already a mentsu.\n\n 1: after drawing one tile, we can form a mentsu. For example, if we have [1m,1m,2m] then by drawing one more 1m we get a triplet. Or if we have [1m,2m,3m] we don't have a mentsu, but wait [1m,2m,3m] is a shuntsu? Actually, no: shuntsu requires three consecutive. [1m,2m,3m] is a shuntsu. But wait, the example says: [1s,2s,3s] -> shuntsu.\n\n However, note the example: [5p,4p,6p] is a shuntsu. Order doesn't matter.\n\n But what if the three tiles are not forming a mentsu? Then we can try drawing one tile to complete a triplet or a sequence.\n\n However, sometimes we might need to draw two? For example, if we have [1m, 2m, 4m] then:\n\n  - Drawing one tile: \n      - To make a triplet: we could draw 1m, then we have [1m,1m,2",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) from her initial three tiles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, we check if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu. A mentsu can be either:\n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles (same digit and suit).\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive digits in the same suit (e.g., [1m, 2m, 3m]).\n\n2. **Check After Drawing One Tile**: If no mentsu is found initially, we then check if drawing one additional tile can form a mentsu. This involves considering all possible tiles that could complete a triplet or sequence with any two of the existing tiles.\n\n3. **Determine Minimum Tiles Needed**: If no mentsu can be formed by drawing one tile, then the answer is 2, as drawing two tiles would allow forming a triplet (by completing a pair to three identical tiles) or a sequence (by adding the missing tile to a sequence).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    tiles = [tile for tile in data if tile]\n\n    # Check if already has a mentsu\n    if is_koutsu(tiles) or is_shuntsu(tiles):\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Check after drawing one tile\n    for i in range(len(tiles)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(tiles)):\n            x = tiles[i]\n            y = tiles[j]\n            for candidate in generate_candidates(x, y):\n                if can_form_mensu([x, y, candidate]):\n                    print(1)\n                    return\n\n    # If still not, then need to draw two tiles\n    print(2)\n\ndef is_koutsu(tiles):\n    if len(set(tiles)) == 1:\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef is_shuntsu(tiles):\n    if len(set(tiles)) != 3:\n        return False\n    tile_set = set(tiles)\n    for first in tile_set:\n        for second in tile_set:\n            if (first[0] == second[0]) and \\\n               (abs(int(first[0]) - int(second[0])) == 1 or abs(int(first[0]) - int(second[0])) == 0):\n                third_needed = None\n                if first[0] == second[0]:\n                    # Then we have two same, so cannot form a sequence of three distinct numbers\n                    continue\n                # Check if the numbers are consecutive\n                a = int(first[0])\n                b = int(second[0])\n                c = 10 - a - b\n                if c < 1 or c > 9:\n                    continue\n                third_candidate = str(c) + first[1]\n                if third_candidate in tile_set:\n                    return True\n    return False\n\ndef generate_candidates(tile1, tile2):\n    candidates = []\n    if tile1[1] == tile2[1]:\n        suit = tile1[1]\n        num1 = int(tile1[0])\n        num2 = int(tile2[0])\n        # For koutsu: we need two more of the same tile.\n        candidates.append(tile1)\n        candidates.append(tile2)\n        # But note: we are generating candidates for the missing tile to form a triplet or sequence with these two.\n        # Actually, in the context of drawing one tile, we consider all possible tiles that could complete a meld with these two.\n        # However, note: we are iterating over pairs and then trying to complete with one more tile.\n        # So we should consider all tiles that share the same suit or same number?

So if they are same, then we already have a triplet, but if they are different, then we need to form a triplet for one of them?\n        # Actually, we are given two tiles and want to see if there's a third tile that can form a meld (triplet or sequence) with these two.\n        # Let's reframe: we have two tiles, and we want to know what third tile (if any) would complete a meld.\n        # We'll break into cases:\n        # Case 1: Koutsu.

If so, it prints `0` since no additional tiles are needed.\n2. **One-Tile Check**: If no mentsu is found, the code checks all pairs of tiles to see if drawing one specific tile (from all possible tiles) can complete a mentsu. This involves checking for potential triplets (three identical tiles) or sequences (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n3. **Two-Tile Check**: If no solution is found with one additional tile, the code defaults to printing `2`, indicating that two tiles need to be drawn to form a mentsu (e.g., completing a pair to a triplet or filling a sequence).\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem by first checking the simplest cases (existing mentsu) and then systematically exploring possibilities with minimal tile draws.",
