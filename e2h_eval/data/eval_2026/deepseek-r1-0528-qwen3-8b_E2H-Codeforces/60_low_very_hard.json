Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented by some substring of S (in Morse code). The catch: not every string of 1 to 4 bits is a valid letter. The invalid ones are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes\" and we map dot to '0' and dash to '1'. And there are 30 possible strings from length 1 to 4, but 4 are invalid.\n\n But note: the substring can be of any length from 1 to 4? Actually, the representation of a letter is at most 4, so any substring longer than 4 doesn't represent a single letter. However, the problem says: \"non-empty sequences of English letters\" meaning we can have multiple letters. But note: the entire substring might be broken down into consecutive letters? However, the example counts:\n\n After S = \"111\": \n   The valid substrings (as single letters) are:\n      \"1\" -> T\n      \"11\" -> M\n      \"111\" -> O\n\n Then sequences of two letters: \n   \"TT\" (which is \"11\" in Morse) -> valid because each letter is T (from \"1\")\n   \"TM\" (which is \"111\") -> wait, but how do we break \"111\" for two letters? \n        Actually, we break the substring arbitrarily. However, note that the Morse code representation of a letter must be contiguous and of length 1 to 4.\n\n But note: the example counts \"TTT\" as one sequence (three T's). However, the example output after \"111\" is 7.\n\n Let me recount the example with S=\"111\":\n   Single-letter words: \n        \"1\" -> T (counted)\n        \"11\" -> M (counted)\n        \"111\" -> O (counted)\n\n   Two-letter words: \n        We need to consider all contiguous substrings that form two consecutive letters. However, note that the entire string is \"111\". How do we break it?\n        Possibilities:\n          [0:1] and [1:3]: then we have two letters: first letter from \"1\" and second from \"1\" -> \"TT\" (which is \"11\", which is the same as the two-dot representation of M, but wait: is that allowed? Actually, the representation for two letters is just the concatenation of two Morse codes. The substring \"11\" can be broken as two separate letters: each being \"1\", so T and T. So that's valid.\n\n        Similarly, we can have:\n          [0:2] and [2:3]: then first letter is \"11\" (M) and the second is \"1\" (T) -> \"MT\"\n          [0:1] and [1:2]: then first letter is \"1\" (T) and the second is \"1\" (T) -> \"TT\"\n\n        Also, we can have two-letter words from the entire string? Actually, the two-letter words must be two consecutive letters, so the substring must be of length 2 or more? Actually, no: the two-letter word requires two letters, so the substring must be of length at least 2 (but each letter is at most 4). However, note that the representation for two letters is the concatenation of two codes, which can be of length from 2 to 8. But wait, the example counts \"TT\" (which is two letters, each represented by 1 bit) as one substring.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"some substring of S\" (in Morse code) represents a sequence of English letters. This means that the substring is broken down into consecutive letters (each of length 1 to 4). But note: the substring must be broken exactly at the boundaries of the letters. \n\n        How to interpret the example: \n            \"TT\" is represented by \"11\", which is the concatenation of two \"1\"s.\n\n        So the idea is: we are allowed to break the substring arbitrarily as long as each part (letter) is one of the valid codes (length 1 to 4, and not one of the four forbidden ones).\n\n        Therefore, we are counting the number of ways to break a contiguous substring of S (at any position) into a sequence of letters (each letter being a contiguous segment of 1 to 4 bits, and the entire segment must not contain any forbidden pattern for the breaks) such that each part is a valid letter.\n\n        However, note: the example also counts \"TM\" and \"MT\" and \"TTT\".",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of a given string S, where each letter is encoded in Morse code using dots ('0') and dashes ('1'). The Morse code representations for letters are strings of length 1 to 4, excluding four invalid combinations: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". \n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid sequences ending at position `i` in the string S. This helps in efficiently counting valid sequences as we process each character in S.\n2. **Tracking Valid Sequences**: For each position `i` in S, we check all possible substrings ending at `i` (from length 1 to 4) to see if they form valid Morse code letters. If they do, we update the DP array accordingly.\n3. **Forbidden Patterns Check**: Before considering a substring as a valid letter, we verify it against the list of forbidden patterns. If it matches any forbidden pattern, it is skipped.\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the results can be very large, all operations are performed modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n5. **Result Calculation**: After processing each character, the total number of valid sequences up to that point is the sum of all values in the DP array, which gives the answer for the current state of S.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    m = int(data[0])\n    s_list = [line.strip() for line in data[1:1+m]]\n    \n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n    total = 0\n    forbidden = {'0011', '0101', '1110', '1111'}\n    \n    out_lines = []\n    \n    for i, bit in enumerate(s_list):\n        new_dp = dp.copy()\n        n = i + 1\n        \n        for j in range(i + 1):\n            substr = ''.join(s_list[j:i+1])\n            if len(substr) > 4:\n                continue\n            \n            if substr in forbidden:\n                continue\n                \n            L = len(substr)\n            if L == 1:\n                new_dp[i] += 1\n            elif L == 2:\n                new_dp[i] += 1\n            elif L == 3:\n                new_dp[i] += 1\n            else:  # L == 4\n                new_dp[i] += 1\n                \n        total_new = 0\n        for k in range(m):\n            total_new = (total_new + dp[k]) % MOD\n        total_new = (total_new + new_dp[i]) % MOD\n        \n        dp = new_dp\n        ans = total_new\n        out_lines.append(str(ans))\n    \n    print(\"\\n\".join(out_lines))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input values, initializes the DP array, and sets up the forbidden patterns set.\n2. **Processing Each Character**: For each character in the input string S, the code checks all possible substrings ending at the current position. These substrings are checked for validity (i.e., not being one of the forbidden patterns and having lengths between 1 and 4).\n3. **Dynamic Programming Update**: The DP array is updated to reflect the number of valid sequences ending at each position. The total number of valid sequences up to the current position is computed by summing the DP values.\n4. **Output**: After processing each character, the total number of valid sequences is printed, ensuring results are modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks valid sequences using dynamic programming, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of 3000 characters.",
