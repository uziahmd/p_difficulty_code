            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three tiles. Each tile is a string of two characters: digit and suit letter (m, p, s).\n We can draw any number of tiles (minimum number) so that we have at least one mentsu (either koutsu or shuntsu).\n\n Since we start with 3 tiles, and we can draw as many as needed, we need to consider:\n\n 1. If we already have a mentsu, then answer is 0.\n\n 2. Otherwise, we consider drawing 1 tile: after drawing one, we have 4 tiles. Then we can check if there's a mentsu.\n\n    However, note: we don't have to form a complete set of four for a mentsu. A mentsu is three tiles. So in the hand of 4 tiles, we only need one set of three that forms a mentsu.\n\n 3. Also, we might consider drawing 2 tiles? But the problem asks for minimum. So we check:\n\n    - 0 draws: check if current three tiles form a mentsu.\n    - 1 draw: if we can form a mentsu by adding one tile, then answer is 1.\n    - 2 draws: if we can form a mentsu by adding two tiles, then answer is 2.\n\n But note: sometimes we might be able to form a mentsu by drawing two tiles, but actually we can also form a mentsu by drawing one tile? Actually, we should check from 0 to 2.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to draw any tiles arbitrarily. But we are looking for the minimum.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Step 1: Check for existing mentsu (0 draws)\n\n   Case 1: Koutsu (triplet) - all three tiles are identical? (same digit and same suit)\n        Example: ['9m', '9m', '9m'] -> yes.\n\n   Case 2: Shuntsu (sequence) - three consecutive numbers (in sorted order) and same suit.\n\n        For example: [1s, 2s, 3s] -> yes.\n\n        Note: The sequence must be three consecutive numbers. The numbers are from 1 to 9, so [7,8,9] is valid, but [9,8,7] is not consecutive? Actually, we sort them.\n\n        Steps for shuntsu:\n          - All same suit.\n          - Sort the numbers (converted to integers) and check if they form an arithmetic progression with difference 1.\n\n        However, note the example: [5s, 7s, 6s] is given as valid. But wait, that is [5,7,6] which when sorted becomes [5,6,7] -> consecutive.\n\n        So we require: \n          - Same suit for all three.\n          - Let the sorted numbers be [a, b, c] (with a<=b<=c). Then we require b = a+1 and c = a+2.\n\n Step 2: If not, check for 1 draw.\n\n   We have 4 tiles: the original three plus one more.\n\n   We can try to see if by adding one tile we can form a mentsu.\n\n   Possibilities:\n\n     a) Form a triplet: \n        - There exists a tile X (any tile) such that when we add X, we have three copies of some tile (or part of a triplet that we complete).\n\n        But note: we are starting with three distinct tiles? Not necessarily: there could be duplicates.\n\n        Actually, the input is three tiles. They might have duplicates.\n\n        Example: ['1m','1m','1m'] -> already done (0 draws). \n\n        What if we have two of the same? e.g., ['1m','1m','2m'].\n\n        Then we can draw a '1m' to make a triplet, or we can draw a '3m' to form a sequence [1m,2m,3m] (if we ignore the extra '1m')? Wait, no: we are allowed to use any three tiles from the four.\n\n        Actually, we are forming one mentsu (three tiles) from the four.\n\n        So for ['1m','1m','2m']:\n          Option 1: Draw another '1m' -> then we have four '1m'. Then we can take three '1m' to form a triplet.\n          Option 2: Draw a '3m' -> then we have [1m,1m,2m,3m]. Then we can form the sequence [1m,2m,3m] (using one '1m', the '2m' and the '3m').\n\n        But note: we don't require to use all the tiles. So we just need one set of three that forms a mentsu.\n\n        Therefore, we can simulate by trying every possible tile (but note: the universe is 27 tiles, but we can think in terms of counts per type).\n\n        However, we can do:\n\n        Let's group the tiles by (digit, suit). Then we have a multiset of three.\n\n        We are allowed to add any tile. We are going to consider:\n\n        Possibility 1: Drawing a tile that completes a triplet.\n\n            For each distinct tile type in the hand, if we have 2 copies, then drawing one more of that type will form a triplet.\n\n            Also, if we have 1 copy, then we cannot complete a triplet by drawing one (unless we have two different types that are same? Actually, no: we need three of the same).\n\n        Possibility 2: Drawing a tile that completes a sequence.\n\n            We are going to look for sequences that can be formed by adding one tile.\n\n            Consider the hand has tiles of same suit. We can try to form a sequence by considering the numbers.\n\n            Example: hand = [1m, 2m, 4m] (and we are going to add one tile). Then we can add 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] and [2m,3m,4m] (two sequences). But note: we only need one.\n\n            However, we have to check for each suit separately.\n\n            Steps for sequence:\n\n            Group by suit.\n\n            For a given suit, let the numbers present be a list (without duplicates? or with duplicates? Actually, duplicates matter because we can use multiple tiles? But note: a sequence requires three distinct numbers. And we can only use a tile once.\n\n            Actually, the hand might have duplicates. So we should consider the multiset.\n\n            Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n            In the hand, for a particular suit, what numbers do we have?\n\n            Then, for that suit, we can form a sequence if there exists a consecutive run of three numbers that we have at least one of each? But wait, we are allowed to draw one tile.\n\n            So we are missing one tile to complete a sequence.\n\n            We can iterate over the suit and the numbers.\n\n            Example: \n              Suit 'm': [1,2,4] -> we can complete the sequence [1,2,3] by drawing 3m, or [2,3,4] by drawing 3m (same tile). So one draw.\n\n            But note: what if we have two duplicates? Example: [1m,2m,2m] (suit 'm': [1,2,2]). Then we can form the sequence [1,2,3] by drawing 3m, but we don't have two 2's to use in two sequences? Actually, we are only using three tiles. So we need one 1, one 2, and one 3. We have two 2's, so we can use one of them for the sequence.\n\n            So the requirement for a sequence is: we have at least one occurrence of two numbers that are consecutive, and the third is missing. But note: we can have multiple sequences.\n\n            Actually, we can also form a sequence that uses a duplicate? No, because the sequence requires three distinct numbers.\n\n            Therefore, we require three distinct numbers (consecutive) and we must have at least one occurrence for each.\n\n            But wait: what if we have two duplicates? Then we can still form the sequence as long as the two duplicates are not breaking the distinct requirement? Actually, we are allowed to use one occurrence per tile.\n\n            So the condition for forming a sequence in a suit S with numbers present (as a multiset) is:\n\n                Let the distinct numbers in the suit S be D (sorted). Then we can form a sequence if there exists a consecutive triplet (x, x+1, x+2) such that:\n\n                    - x, x+1, x+2 are all in D (with at least one occurrence each) OR\n\n                But wait, we can draw one tile. So we are allowed to have one missing number.\n\n                So we can form a sequence if:\n\n                    There exists a consecutive triplet (x, x+1, x+2) such that:\n\n                    - Two of the three numbers are present, and the third is missing.\n\n                But note: what if we have two of the same number? Then we can use one occurrence for the sequence, and the other occurrence can be used for nothing (we don't need it). However, the sequence requires distinct numbers.\n\n            Example: [1m,2m,2m] -> we can form [1,2,3] by drawing 3m, even though we have two 2m's.\n\n            However, what if we have [1m,2m,3m] already? Then we don't need to draw.\n\n            Also, what if we have [1m,1m,2m,3m] (but wait, we are only drawing one so we start with three) -> no, we are starting with three.\n\n            So for the hand of three tiles, we can have:\n\n                Case A: All three same suit: then we can try to form a sequence by checking the numbers.\n\n                Case B: Two same suit, one different.\n\n                Case C: Three different suits.\n\n            But note: a sequence must be in the same suit.\n\n            So for a given suit S, let the multiset of numbers be M (with duplicates). Then we can form a sequence in suit S if:\n\n                There exists a consecutive triplet (x, x+1, x+2) such that:\n\n                    x is in M, x+1 is in M, and x+2 is in M? Actually, no: we can draw one tile. So we are missing one.\n\n                Actually, we are allowed to draw one tile. So we can complete one gap.\n\n                Conditions:\n\n                  - The consecutive triplet (x, x+1, x+2) must have at least two numbers present (so we are missing one).\n\n                However, we might have more than one way to complete? But we only need one.\n\n            But note: the hand has three tiles. So the multiset M for a suit S can have:\n\n                Option 1: One tile in S: then we need two more consecutive numbers. But we can only draw one tile, so we cannot get two consecutive numbers at once. So we cannot form a sequence in S with one draw.\n\n                Option 2: Two tiles in S: then we have two numbers, say a and b (a <= b). Then we can form a sequence if:\n\n                    - The two numbers are consecutive? Then we need one more number (either a-1 or b+1). But wait, we can only draw one tile. So if we have [a, b] and |a-b|==1, then we can draw either a-1 or b+1 to complete the sequence.\n\n                    - Or if the two numbers are not consecutive, then we cannot form a sequence with one draw (because we would need two tiles to complete the sequence).\n\n                Option 3: Three tiles in S: then we have three numbers. Then we can form a sequence if the three numbers (when sorted) form a consecutive triplet (i.e., [n, n+1, n+2])? Actually, no: if they are consecutive, then we already have a sequence (so 0 draws). But if they are not consecutive, then we can complete a sequence by drawing one tile? \n\n                    Example: [1m,2m,4m] -> we can draw 3m to complete two sequences: [1,2,3] and [2,3,4]. But note: we are only concerned with having at least one mentsu.\n\n                    However, if we have [1m,3m,4m]: then we can draw 2m to form [1,2,3] or [2,3,4] (but note: [1,2,3] requires 2m and [2,3,4] requires 2m too). So one draw.\n\n                    But what if we have [1m,1m,2m] (three tiles, two of which are same)? Then we have two distinct numbers: 1 and 2. So we can form [1,2,3] by drawing 3m. But note: we have two 1m's, so we can use one 1m, the 2m and the 3m.\n\n            So for a suit S, we can form a sequence with one draw if:\n\n                Let the distinct numbers in S be D (from the three tiles). Then we can consider:\n\n                If |D| == 1: then we have three same numbers (like [1m,1m,1m]) -> then we can form a triplet (koutsu) by drawing one more, but that's a different mentsu (triplet). But wait, we are considering sequence here. For sequence we require distinct numbers.\n\n                Actually, we are considering two independent mentsu: triplet and sequence.\n\n                So for one draw, we can either:\n\n                    - Complete a triplet: if there's a tile type that appears exactly twice, then drawing that tile type once gives a triplet.\n\n                    - Complete a sequence: if there's a suit S and in that suit we have two distinct numbers that are consecutive, then we can draw the missing number (either the lower-1 or the higher+1) to complete a sequence.\n\n                    Or, if we have two distinct numbers that are not consecutive, we cannot form a sequence with one draw.\n\n                    Or, if we have three distinct numbers (so |D|=3) in the same suit, then we can form a sequence if the three numbers are consecutive? Actually, no: if they are consecutive, then we already have a sequence (0 draws). But if they are not consecutive, we might be able to complete a sequence by drawing one tile. However, we have three distinct numbers. To form a sequence we need three consecutive. So if the numbers are [a, b, c] (sorted) and they are not consecutive, then we need to draw one tile to complete one of the gaps? Actually, we can only complete one gap. \n\n                    Example: [1,3,4] -> we can draw 2 to form [1,2,3] (then we have [1,2,3,4] but the sequence [1,2,3] is formed). Similarly, we can draw 5 to form [3,4,5]. But note: we are only concerned with having one mentsu.\n\n                    So condition: if the three distinct numbers (in the same suit) are not consecutive, then we can complete a sequence by drawing the missing number in the middle or the next one.\n\n                    Actually, we can form a sequence if the maximum gap between consecutive numbers (when sorted) is 1 or 2.\n\n                    Specifically, for three distinct numbers a < b < c:\n\n                      If b == a+1 and c == b+1, then they are consecutive (already done, 0 draws).\n\n                      Else, we can complete a sequence by drawing one tile:\n\n                          - If the gaps are: a, b, c such that (b-a==1 and c-b==2) OR (b-a==2 and c-b==1) OR (b-a==1 and c-b==1) is consecutive but we already checked that. \n\n                      Actually, we can check:\n\n                          The set {a, b, c} must contain two consecutive numbers and the third is either adjacent or not? \n\n                    Alternatively, we can check the entire set of numbers (the three) and see if we can form a consecutive triplet by adding one.\n\n                    We need to see if there exists a consecutive triplet (x, x+1, x+2) such that at least two of the three numbers are in the hand (for the same suit).\n\n                    But note: we have three numbers, so we can check:\n\n                      Let the three numbers (distinct) be [a, b, c] (sorted). Then we can check the gaps.\n\n                    Actually, we can simply check for every possible consecutive triplet that covers the range from min(a) to max(c)+2 (or something) but that might be inefficient, but the numbers are only 1-9.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can check:\n\n                      The consecutive triplets that are relevant are:\n\n                        [a-1, a, a+1] but we don't have a-1, but we have a and a+1? Actually, we have a, b, c.\n\n                    Instead, we can consider:\n\n                      The minimal consecutive triplet that can be formed by adding one tile must include two of the existing numbers.\n\n                    Since we have three distinct numbers, the consecutive triplet must be one of:\n\n                      [min-1, min, min+1] -> then we need min-1 (if min-1 is missing) and we have min and min+1? But wait, we don't know if we have min+1. Actually, we have three numbers, so we have to consider the entire set.\n\n                    This might be complex.\n\n            Alternatively, we can think: we are allowed to draw one tile. Then we can form a sequence if there exists a consecutive triplet (x, x+1, x+2) such that:\n\n                - The hand (in that suit) contains at least two of the three numbers, OR\n\n                But wait, if we have three distinct numbers, then we have three numbers. Then we can form a sequence if the three numbers are consecutive (then 0 draws) or if they are not consecutive, we can complete a sequence by drawing one tile to complete one gap? Actually, no: if we have [1,3,4] (suit S) then we can draw 2 to form [1,2,3] (using 1,2,3) and we have 4 left. But that's okay, because we only need one mentsu.\n\n            So for a suit S, if we have three distinct numbers, then we can form a sequence by drawing one tile if:\n\n                There exists a consecutive triplet (x, x+1, x+2) such that at least two of the three numbers are in the hand (in that suit) and the third is missing.\n\n            But note: we have three distinct numbers. So the hand has three distinct numbers in suit S. Then the consecutive triplet must be one that includes two of these three.\n\n            Example: [1,3,4] -> \n                Check triplet [1,2,3]: we have 1 and 3 (so two out of three) -> missing 2 -> so we can draw 2.\n                Check triplet [2,3,4]: we have 3 and 4 -> missing 2 -> so we can draw 2 (same tile).\n\n            Example: [1,2,4] -> \n                [1,2,3]: we have 1,2 -> missing 3 -> draw 3.\n                [2,3,4]: we have 2,4 -> missing 3 -> draw 3.\n\n            Example: [1,2,3] -> already done (0 draws).\n\n            Example: [1,2,5] -> \n                [1,2,3]: missing 3 -> draw 3.\n                [2,3,4]: missing 3 and 4 -> but we only need to complete one gap? Actually, we are missing two numbers for [2,3,4] so we cannot complete [2,3,4] with one draw. But [1,2,3] is incomplete by one (we have 1,2). So we can complete [1,2,3] by drawing 3.\n\n            Example: [1,4,5] -> \n                [3,4,5]: we have 4,5 -> missing 3 -> draw 3.\n                [4,5,6]: missing 6 -> draw 6.\n\n            Example: [1,2,9] -> \n                [1,2,3]: missing 3 -> draw 3.\n                [8,9,10]: but 10 is invalid, so [8,9,10] is not considered. Actually, the consecutive triplet must be within 1-9.\n\n            However, note: the sequence must be three consecutive numbers, so the numbers must be between 1 and 9. So the consecutive triplet must have x>=1 and x+2<=9.\n\n            So for [1,2,9]: \n                [1,2,3]: valid (x=1) -> we can draw 3.\n                [8,9,10]: invalid (10 not allowed) -> skip.\n\n            Therefore, the condition for a suit S (with three distinct numbers) is: there exists an integer x (from 1 to 7) such that the consecutive triplet [x, x+1, x+2] has at least two numbers in the hand (in suit S) and x, x+1, x+2 are in the range [1,9].\n\n            But note: we have three distinct numbers, so we have three numbers. We can check the gaps. Alternatively, we can simply iterate over x from 1 to 7 and check.\n\n            However, we have three distinct numbers, so we can also check without iterating: the numbers are a, b, c (sorted). Then the consecutive triplets that can be completed are:\n\n                [a-1, a, a+1] if a+1 is present and a-1 is missing? Actually, we have a, and maybe a+1 is present.\n\n            This seems messy.\n\n        Given the small range (only 1 to 9), we can do:\n\n            For a given suit S, let the set of numbers present be T (the distinct numbers, but note: duplicates don't help for distinct requirement, so we only care about distinct numbers? Actually, duplicates: if we have [1m,1m,2m] then we have two distinct numbers: 1 and 2. But we can use one 1m and the 2m and then draw 3m to form [1,2,3]. So duplicates don't help for forming a sequence (unless we have three same for triplet).\n\n        Actually, for sequence we require distinct numbers (each tile in the sequence must be distinct). So duplicates don't help for forming a sequence (they can be used only once).\n\n        Therefore, we can reduce the suit S to the set of distinct numbers (ignoring duplicates) for the purpose of forming a sequence.\n\n        But wait: what if we have two duplicates? Then we have less distinct numbers. So:\n\n          For suit S, let the multiset be M. Then the distinct numbers available are the set of numbers that appear at least once.\n\n        Now, to form a sequence in suit S, we require three consecutive distinct numbers (each at least one occurrence). And we can draw one tile to complete one gap.\n\n        Steps for one-draw sequence in suit S:\n\n            Let T = set of distinct numbers in suit S.\n\n            Then, we can form a sequence if there exists a consecutive triplet (x, x+1, x+2) such that |T ∩ {x, x+1, x+2}| >= 2 and x, x+1, x+2 are in the range [1,9].\n\n        Why two? Because we are drawing one tile, so we can only provide one missing number. Then the triplet must have at least two numbers already.\n\n        Similarly, for triplet: we can complete a triplet if there exists a tile type (digit and suit S) such that we have exactly two of that tile type. Then drawing one more gives three.\n\n        But note: we can also form a triplet by drawing a tile of a different suit? No, triplet must be same tile (same digit and same suit). \n\n        However, wait: the definition: koutsu is three identical tiles. So same digit and same suit.\n\n        So for triplet, we consider each distinct tile (digit and suit). \n\n        Example: ['1m','1m','2p']: \n            We have two '1m'. Then we can draw a '1m' to complete the triplet.\n\n        Example: ['1m','1p','1s']: \n            We have one of each. Then we cannot complete a triplet by drawing one tile (because we would need two more of one specific type, but then we have two of one and one of others, and then we don't have three of one).\n\n        But wait, we can draw two tiles: two '1m' to get three '1m'. But that's two draws.\n\n        However, we are checking one draw: so only one tile is drawn.\n\n        So for triplet in one draw: we require that there is at least one tile type (same digit and same suit) that appears exactly two times in the hand.\n\n        Similarly, for sequence: we require that in at least one suit, there exists a consecutive triplet (x, x+1, x+2) such that at least two of the three numbers are present in that suit.\n\n        But note: the hand has three tiles. The total distinct tile types (by digit and suit) might be 1, 2, or 3.\n\n        We can break down:\n\n          Let the hand be represented as a list of three strings.\n\n          Step 1: Check for 0 draws.\n\n          Step 2: Check for 1 draw:\n\n            Condition 1: There exists a tile type (digit and suit) that appears exactly two times -> then we can draw one more of that type to complete a triplet.\n\n            Condition 2: There exists a suit S and a consecutive triplet (x, x+1, x+2) (with x from 1 to 7) such that in suit S, at least two of the numbers x, x+1, x+2 are present.\n\n          Step 3: If none of the above, then check for 2 draws.\n\n            With two draws, we can form a mentsu in several ways:\n\n            Possibility 1: Form a triplet: we can draw two copies of a tile type that currently appears once. Then we have three copies.\n\n            Possibility 2: Form a sequence: we can draw two tiles to complete a consecutive triplet (if we are missing two numbers in a suit).\n\n            But note: we might also form two different mentsu? Actually, we only need one.\n\n            Actually, we can also combine: for example, if we have [1m, 2m, 3m] we don't need any. But if we have [1m, 1m, 2m] (two same) then we can form a triplet by drawing one more 1m, so one draw. But if we have [1m, 2m, 4m] (all distinct, same suit) then we can draw two tiles: 3m and ...? Actually, we can form two sequences? But we only need one. Actually, we can form [1,2,3] by drawing 3m, so one draw.\n\n            Another example: [1m, 4m, 5m] (same suit). Then we can form [3,4,5] by drawing 3m (one draw). But wait, we have [1m,4m,5m]: \n                We can form a sequence [3,4,5] by drawing 3m (one draw). But we can also form [1,2,3] by drawing 2m and 3m (two draws) is not minimal. So we found one draw.\n\n            How about [1m, 5m, 9m]? Then we can form a sequence by drawing two tiles: for example, [5,6,7] (draw 6m and 7m) or [4,5,6] (draw 4m and 6m). But wait, we can also form [7,8,9] by drawing 7m and 8m. So two draws.\n\n            But wait, we can also form a triplet? Not really, unless we have two of the same. \n\n            However, note: we can form two different sequences? Actually, we don't need to form two. We just need one.\n\n            The minimal two draws might be achieved by completing a triplet (if we have one tile type appearing once, then we can draw two of that type to form a triplet) or by completing a sequence (if we are missing two numbers in a consecutive triplet).\n\n            But note: we can also mix: for example, we have two different suits. \n\n            Example: ['1m','1p','2s'] -> no triplet (each tile is distinct) and no sequence (different suits). Then we can draw two tiles: for example, two '1m' to form a triplet (then we have ['1m','1m','1m','1p','2s']). But wait, we can also draw one '2m' and one '3m' to form a sequence [1m,2m,3m] (if we had 1m originally, then we draw 2m and 3m). But we only have one '1m'. So we can draw two tiles: two more '1m' for a triplet, or one '2m' and one '3m' for a sequence (but then we have two tiles drawn). \n\n            Actually, we are drawing two tiles. But note: we can choose any two tiles. So we can draw two '1m' to form a triplet (then we have four '1m').\n\n            Alternatively, we can draw two tiles to form a sequence: we need three consecutive in one suit. We can choose to form a sequence in suit 'm': we have one '1m'. Then we need to draw two more: 2m and 3m. Then we have [1m,2m,3m] (using the original '1m' and the two drawn). Similarly, we can form a sequence in suit 'p' or 's'.\n\n            So for two draws, we can:\n\n                Option A: Complete a triplet: for any tile type (digit and suit) that appears at least once, we can draw two more of that type (if we have one, then two draws; if we have two, then one draw already covered).\n\n                Option B: Complete a sequence: for a suit S, we can form a consecutive triplet (x,x+1,x+2) by drawing the two missing numbers (if we have one or zero of the three numbers). But we are allowed to draw two tiles.\n\n            However, we want the minimum. So if one draw doesn't work, then two draws is the answer.\n\n            But wait: what if we have two draws and we can form a mentsu? Then the answer is 2.\n\n        However, note: we might form a mentsu by drawing two tiles, but there might be cases where we don't? Actually, the problem states that we can draw any tiles arbitrarily (even duplicates). So we can always form a triplet by drawing two of the same tile (if we have at least one of that tile). \n\n        Example: if we have one tile, then we can draw two more to form a triplet.\n\n        But we start with three tiles. The worst-case scenario: we have three distinct tiles (different digit or different suit). Then:\n\n            We can form a triplet by drawing two of one of the existing tile types (if we have one of a tile, then two draws). Or we can form a sequence by drawing two tiles to complete a consecutive triplet.\n\n        However, note: we might have two tiles of the same suit but non consecutive. \n\n        But the problem says: print the minimum number of draws.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            ans = 0\n            if has_mentsu(three_tiles): print(0)\n\n            else if has_one_draw_mentsu(three_tiles): print(1)\n\n            else: print(2)\n\n        But wait: is it always 0, 1, or 2? \n\n        Let me think: \n\n          With 0 draws: if we have a mentsu.\n\n          With 1 draw: if we can form a mentsu by drawing one tile.\n\n          With 2 draws: otherwise.\n\n        However, is 2 always sufficient? \n\n          Yes, because we can always form a triplet by drawing two tiles: choose any tile in the hand (say tile A) and draw two copies of tile A. Then we have three copies of A, which is a triplet.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is at most 2.\n\n        So the algorithm:\n\n          Step 1: Parse the input.\n\n          Step 2: Check for 0 draws.\n\n          Step 3: Check for 1 draw.\n\n          Step 4: Otherwise, output 2.\n\n        Implementation details:\n\n          Represent the hand as a list of three strings.\n\n          For 0 draws:\n\n            Check for triplet: \n                Count the frequency of each tile (by the whole string: '1m', '1p', etc.)\n\n                If there is a tile that appears three times: then return 0.\n\n            Check for sequence:\n\n                Group by suit. For a suit, if there are at least three tiles, then extract the distinct numbers and check if they form a consecutive triplet (sorted, and [n, n+1, n+2]).\n\n                But note: the hand has three tiles. So for a suit, we can have up to three tiles.\n\n                Example: ['1m','2m','3m'] -> yes.\n\n                Example: ['1m','1m','2m'] -> no, because distinct numbers are [1,2] (so not three distinct consecutive). But wait, we have three tiles: two of one and one of another. Then we don't have three distinct numbers. \n\n                Actually, for a sequence we need three distinct numbers (because the definition is three sequential numbered tiles). \n\n                So we require the same suit and three distinct numbers (each tile is distinct) that form a consecutive triplet.\n\n                But wait: the example [1m,2m,3m] has three distinct tiles (each tile is distinct) and forms a sequence.\n\n                However, what if we have [1m,1m,2m,3m] (but we have only three tiles) -> we don't. \n\n                But note: the hand has three tiles. So if we have two of the same, then we cannot form a sequence (because we need three distinct numbers). \n\n                Therefore, for a sequence, the three tiles must be of the same suit and the numbers must be three consecutive distinct numbers.\n\n          Step 3: Check for 1 draw:\n\n            Condition 1: Triplet completion.\n\n                We can complete a triplet if there is a tile type (same digit and same suit) that appears exactly two times.\n\n                Example: ['1m','1m','2m'] -> '1m' appears twice, so we can draw one '1m' to complete.\n\n            Condition 2: Sequence completion.\n\n                We can complete a sequence if:\n\n                    There exists a suit S such that:\n\n                        Let T_S be the set of distinct numbers in suit S.\n\n                        Then, there exists an integer x (from 1 to 7) such that the consecutive triplet (x, x+1, x+2) satisfies:\n\n                            |T_S ∩ {x, x+1, x+2}| >= 2   (at least two numbers from the triplet are present in T_S)\n\n                        And note: the numbers in the consecutive triplet must be in the range [1,9] (which they are by x from 1 to 7).\n\n                Example: ['1m','2m','4m'] -> suit 'm': T_S = {1,2,4}\n\n                    Check triplet (1,2,3): present {1,2} -> two numbers -> valid.\n                    Check triplet (2,3,4): present {2,4} -> two numbers -> valid.\n\n                Example: ['1m','3m','4m'] -> T_S = {1,3,4}\n                    Check triplet (1,2,3): {1,3} -> two numbers -> valid.\n                    Check triplet (2,3,4): {3,4} -> two numbers -> valid.\n\n                Example: ['1m','2m','5m'] -> T_S = {1,2,5}\n                    Check triplet (1,2,3): {1,2} -> two numbers -> valid.\n\n                Example: ['1m','4m','5m'] -> T_S = {1,4,5}\n                    Check triplet (1,2,3): {1} -> one number -> invalid.\n                    Check triplet (2,3,4): {4} -> one number -> invalid.\n                    Check triplet (3,4,5): {4,5} -> two numbers -> valid.\n\n                Example: ['1m','1m','2m'] -> suit 'm': T_S = {1,2} (distinct numbers). \n                    Check triplet (1,2,3): {1,2} -> two numbers -> valid.\n\n                Example: ['1m','1m','1m'] -> already handled by triplet (0 draws).\n\n                Example: ['1m','2m','3m'] -> already handled by sequence (0 draws).\n\n                Example: ['1m','2m','4m'] -> valid by one draw.\n\n            But wait: in the example ['1m','1m','2m']: \n                We can complete a sequence by drawing 3m (to form [1,2",
