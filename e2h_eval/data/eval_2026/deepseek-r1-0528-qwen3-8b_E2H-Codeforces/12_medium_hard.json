The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the task locations)\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (from 1 to n, then back to 1), we can consider the movement in two directions.\n\n However, note: the problem states that Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in order. \n The key is: for the i-th task, she must be in house a_i and also have completed all tasks with numbers less than i.\n\n Since the ringroad is one-way clockwise, moving from house x to house y:\n   If x <= y: then the distance is (y - x) mod n? But wait, because it's a ring, we might have two ways: \n   However, note: the problem says the traffic is one way (clockwise). So we cannot go counterclockwise? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time\" and the traffic is one way (clockwise). \n Therefore, we can only move from a house i to house i+1 (if i < n) or to house 1 (if i == n) and so on.\n\n But note: the example: \n   Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n   Output: 6\n\n How does the example work?\n   Start at house 1.\n   First task: house 3 -> moves: 1->2->3 (distance = 2)\n   Then from 3 to 2: since we can only move clockwise, we have to go from 3 to 4, then 1, then 2: that's 3 steps? \n   But wait, the example says the sequence is: 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. So from 3 to 2: 3->4 (1 step), 4->1 (2nd), 1->2 (3rd) -> total 3 steps.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: the ring has n houses. The clockwise distance from x to y is:\n   d(x, y) = (y - x) % n, but if negative we adjust? Actually, since we can only move clockwise, the distance from x to y is:\n      if y >= x: then (y - x)\n      else: then (n - x + y)\n\n However, note: the example from 3 to 2: \n   Using the above: since 2 < 3, then distance = n - 3 + 2 = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3, which matches.\n\n But wait, the example total time is 6: \n   First task: 1 to 3: since 3>=1, distance=2.\n   Then from 3 to 2: 3 steps.\n   Then from 2 to 3: 1 step (because 3>=2: 3-2=1).\n\n Total: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.\n\n However, note the condition: \"she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i\". \n The tasks are in order. So we start at 1, then do task 1 (house 3), then task 2 (house 2), then task 3 (house 3).\n\n But what if we have consecutive same tasks? Then we don't need to move.\n\n So the idea: we have a starting point (current house) and then we go through each task.\n\n Steps:\n   current = 1\n   total_time = 0\n   for each task location a_i:\n        if a_i >= current:\n            distance = a_i - current\n        else:\n            distance = n - current + a_i\n\n        total_time += distance\n        current = a_i   # because after completing the task, we are at a_i\n\n However, let's test with the second example:\n   Input: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n\n   Step 1: current=1, task at 2: \n        2>=1 -> distance=1, total_time=1, current=2.\n\n   Step 2: current=2, task at 3:\n        3>=2 -> distance=1, total_time=2, current=3.\n\n   Step 3: current=3, task at 3: distance=0, total_time=2.\n\n   Output: 2, which matches.\n\n But wait, the example input was given as two examples:\n\n   Example 1: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" -> output 6\n   Example 2: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" -> output 2\n\n So our method seems to work.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\" \n Our method handles that by setting current to the last task's house.\n\n But note: the problem states that initially she is at house 1, and the first task must be done. Then the second task must be done (and so on). \n\n However, there's a catch: the ringroad is circular and we are only allowed to move clockwise. Therefore, the direct way is as above.\n\n But wait, is there a possibility to skip some tasks and then come back? \n No, because the condition says: complete all tasks with numbers less than i before the i-th task.\n\n Therefore, the order is fixed.\n\n However, note that the example: \n   \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n\n   Our calculation: \n      1 -> 3: 2 units\n      3 -> 2: 3 units (because 2<3: n-3+2=4-3+2=3)\n      2 -> 3: 1 unit\n\n   Total: 2+3+1=6.\n\n But wait, what if we break down the movement from 3 to 2 differently? \n   We must go from 3 to 4, then 4 to 1, then 1 to 2: that's 3 steps.\n\n Another way: from 3, we can go clockwise until 2: that is 3->4->1->2, so 3 steps.\n\n So the calculation is correct.\n\n However, note that the constraints are up to 10^5 for n and m, so we must use an O(m) solution.\n\n Since we are doing a single pass through the tasks, it is O(m) which is acceptable.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n But wait: what if we have a long sequence of tasks that go backwards (in terms of increasing index) many times? \n   Example: n=10, tasks: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n\n   Step1: 1->5: 4 steps (since 5>=1: 5-1=4)\n   Step2: 5->4: 10-5+4=9 steps (because 4<5)\n   Step3: 4->3: 10-4+3=9 steps\n   Step4: 3->2: 10-3+2=9 steps\n   Step5: 2->1: 10-2+1=9 steps\n\n   Total: 4+9+9+9+9=40.\n\n   But let's check: \n      Start at 1, go to 5: 1->2->3->4->5: 4 steps.\n      Then from 5 to 4: 5->6->7->8->9->10->1->2->3->4: 9 steps? Actually, we can count:\n          From 5: next is 6,7,8,9,10, then 1,2,3,4 -> 9 steps.\n\n   So yes, 40.\n\n   But note: the problem doesn't require us to optimize the entire journey in one go. The above method is straightforward.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the problem says the ringroad is one-way clockwise, so we can't go backwards.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Read n and m.\n   Read the list of m integers.\n\n   current = 1\n   total = 0\n   for each task_location in the list:\n        if task_location >= current:\n            distance = task_location - current\n        else:\n            distance = n - current + task_location\n\n        total += distance\n        current = task_location\n\n   Print(total)\n\n Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: n=4, m=3, tasks=[3,2,3]\n        current=1, task=3: 3>=1 -> distance=2, total=2, current=3.\n        task=2: 2<3 -> distance=4-3+2=3, total=5, current=2.\n        task=3: 3>=2 -> distance=1, total=6.\n\n   Example 2: n=4, m=3, tasks=[2,3,3]\n        current=1, task=2: 2>=1 -> distance=1, total=1, current=2.\n        task=3: 3>=2 -> distance=1, total=2, current=3.\n        task=3: 0, total=2.\n\n   This matches.\n\n However, note: the problem says the ringroad has n houses, and the houses are numbered 1 through n in clockwise order.\n\n But wait, what if the task locations are not in the range [1, n]? The input says 1<=ai<=n, so we are safe.\n\n One more edge: when n=2, and m=1, task=[1]: \n        current=1, task=1: 1>=1 -> distance=0, total=0.\n\n   n=2, m=2, tasks=[2,1]:\n        current=1, task=2: 2>=1 -> distance=1, total=1, current=2.\n        task=1: 1<2 -> distance=2-2+1=1, total=2.\n\n   Now, check: from 1->2 (1 step), then from 2->1: we must go 2->1 (but wait, in a ring of 2: 2 goes to 1 (one step). \n   So total 2 steps.\n\n   But according to our formula: \n        For the second task: n - current + task_location = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1.\n\n   So that's correct.\n\n Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem says the ringroad is one-way clockwise, so the movement from house n to house 1 is allowed and is one step.\n\n In our formula for the case when task_location < current, we are effectively going from current to the end (house n) and then from house 1 to task_location.\n\n The number of steps from current to n is (n - current), then from 1 to task_location is (task_location - 1) but wait, no: \n   Actually, the entire ring has n houses. The clockwise path from current to task_location when task_location < current is:\n        current, current+1, ... , n, 1, 2, ... , task_location.\n\n   The number of steps is (n - current) + (task_location) [because from current to n: n-current steps, then from 1 to task_location: task_location steps?] \n   But wait, from 1 to task_location: we don't pass through 1 again? Actually, we start at current, then we go to current+1, ... until n (which is n-current steps to get to n), then from n to 1 is one more step? \n\n   Let me recount the steps from current to task_location when task_location < current:\n\n   We break the journey into two parts:\n      Part1: from current to n: that's (n - current) steps (because we go from current to current+1, current+2, ..., n)\n      Part2: from n to 1: that's 1 step (to enter the next cycle) and then from 1 to task_location: that's (task_location - 1) steps?\n\n   Actually, no: the entire movement from current to task_location (with task_location < current) is:\n\n        current, current+1, ..., n, 1, 2, ..., task_location.\n\n   The steps from current to n: (n - current)\n   Then from n to 1: 1 step (so now we are at 1)\n   Then from 1 to task_location: (task_location - 1) steps? But wait, we are at 1 and then we move to 2,3,...,task_location: that's (task_location - 1) steps.\n\n   So total steps = (n - current) + 1 + (task_location - 1) = n - current + task_location.\n\n   Which is exactly our formula.\n\n   However, note: if we are already at n, then we cannot use the above because the problem says the ringroad has n houses. \n   But our formula works for any current from 1 to n.\n\n   Example: current = 4, task_location = 3, n=4: \n        steps = 4 - 4 + 3 = 3.\n\n   The actual steps: 4->1->2->3: that's 3 steps.\n\n   Example: current = 3, task_location = 2, n=4: \n        steps = 4-3+2=3: 3->4->1->2.\n\n   So the formula is correct.\n\n Code:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   current = 1\n   total_time = 0\n   for t in tasks:\n        if t >= current:\n            total_time += t - current\n        else:\n            total_time += n - current + t\n        current = t\n\n   print(total_time)\n\n But wait, what if we have a very large n and m? The arithmetic operations are O(1) per task, so overall O(m) which is acceptable.\n\n Let's submit this.\n\n However, note: the problem constraints say n and m can be up to 10^5. The above operations are basic arithmetic and we are reading from stdin. \n\n We assume the input is given as specified.\n\n But wait, the example inputs are given as strings in the example, but the problem reads from stdin.\n\n We'll run the code with the sample inputs.\n\n Sample Input 1:\n    4 3\n    3 2 3\n\n Sample Input 2:\n    4 3\n    2 3 3\n\n Let me run the code with these.\n\n   For sample 1: \n        n=4, m=3, tasks=[3,2,3] -> outputs 6.\n\n   For sample 2: \n        n=4, m=3, tasks=[2,3,3] -> outputs 2.\n\n It should be correct.\n\n However, note: the problem says the first line contains two integers n and m, and the second line contains m integers.\n\n There's no extra spaces or anything? The problem says: \"The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n)\".\n\n So we can use split() and map to int.\n\n But note: the example input format: \n        \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n\n   and\n\n        \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n\n So the code should be:\n\n   import sys\n\n   data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n   n = int(data[0])\n   m = int(data[1])\n   tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n\n But the problem says the first line has two integers and the second line has m integers. So the total tokens will be 2+m.\n\n Alternatively, we can read the first line, then the second line.\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n But note: if the input is large, using sys.stdin.read() might be faster, but the problem constraints are 10^5, and using input() in Python is generally acceptable.\n\n However, let's stick to the simpler method.\n\n But wait: the problem says the second line contains m integers. There is no newline issue? \n\n Let me test with the sample.\n\n   For the first sample: \n        Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n\n   After splitting the first line: ['4','3'] -> n=4, m=3.\n   Then the next line: '3 2 3' -> split gives ['3','2','3'].\n\n   Then tasks = [3,2,3]\n\n   Correct.\n\n However, what if there are spaces at the end of the line? The split() method by default splits by whitespace and ignores trailing and leading spaces.\n\n So it's safe.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n But note: the problem says the input is from standard input.\n\n Final code:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   current = 1\n   total = 0\n   for t in tasks:\n        if t >= current:\n            total += t - current\n        else:\n            total += n - current + t\n        current = t\n\n   print(total)\n\n However, wait: there's an alternative way to compute the distance: \n        distance = (t - current) % n   ? \n   But modulo operation doesn't work that way for positive movement.\n\n   Example: from 3 to 2 in a ring of 4: (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4 = 3, which is correct.\n\n   But then from 2 to 3: (3-2)%4 = 1, correct.\n\n   However, note: the modulus operation gives the shortest circular distance? In a bidirectional ring we might use the minimum between (t-current) and (n - (t-current)), but here we are forced to go clockwise only.\n\n   In our case, the clockwise only movement means we never use the counterclockwise part. The above modulus method actually gives the clockwise distance from current to t if we were allowed to go either way? \n\n   Actually, no: the modulus method gives the smallest non-negative residue, but in our problem we are forced to go clockwise. The clockwise distance from current to t is always defined as above.\n\n   However, we can also compute the clockwise distance without condition by:\n\n        distance = (t - current) % n\n        But wait, if (t - current) is negative, then (t - current) % n gives a positive number that is equivalent to the clockwise distance? \n\n   Let me test: \n        current=3, t=2, n=4: \n            (2-3) = -1, then -1 % 4 = 3 (because -1 + 4 = 3). So yes, that gives 3.\n\n        current=2, t=3, n=4: (3-2)=1, 1%4=1.\n\n        current=4, t=1, n=4: (1-4)=-3, -3%4=1. But the clockwise distance from 4 to 1 is 1 (4->1). Correct.\n\n        current=1, t=4, n=4: (4-1)=3, 3%4=3. Correct.\n\n   However, note: the modulus operation for negative numbers in Python returns a result in the range [0, n-1]. But we want the clockwise distance, and the modulus method gives the same result as our conditional method.\n\n   But wait, what if we do:\n\n        distance = (t - current) % n\n\n   However, if t==current, then (t-current)=0, 0%n=0. Correct.\n\n   But note: the modulus operation does not give the same result as our conditional method for the case when t>=current? \n        For t>=current: \n            (t - current) % n = t - current   (because t-current is between 0 and n-1, so modulo n doesn't change it)\n\n        For t<current:\n            (t - current) % n = t - current + n   (because t-current is negative, and we add n to make it positive and then modulo n, but since |t-current| < n, then t-current+n is the positive representation and modulo n leaves it unchanged).\n\n   Therefore, we can write:\n\n        distance = (t - current) % n\n\n   But wait, is that always the clockwise distance? \n\n   However, note: the modulus operation in this context gives the minimal non-negative residue, which is the clockwise distance in a clockwise-only ring? \n\n   Actually, in a clockwise-only ring, the distance from current to t is:\n        If t >= current: then t - current.\n        If t < current: then (t - current + n) % n? But wait, (t - current + n) is positive and less than n? \n\n   But note: our modulus operation is (t - current) % n, which is the same as (t - current + n) if t < current, because we are adding n until the result is in [0, n-1]. And since the distance must be non-negative and less than n, then the modulus gives the clockwise distance.\n\n   However, note: the modulus operation for (t - current) might be negative, and then we add n until positive. But the clockwise distance is defined as the number of steps we take in the clockwise direction. \n\n   But wait, the problem does not require the minimal steps in a bidirectional ring, but we are forced to move clockwise. The clockwise distance from current to t is:\n\n        if t >= current: t - current\n        else: n - current + t\n\n   And note: n - current + t = t - current + n, which is the same as (t - current) % n when (t - current) is negative.\n\n   Therefore, we can also write:\n\n        distance = (t - current) % n\n\n   However, wait: if we use modulus, then for t>=current, we get the same as our condition, and for t<current, we get the same.\n\n   But let me test with the example: \n        n=4, current=3, t=2: (2-3) % 4 = (-1)%4 = 3. Correct.\n\n   However, note: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers: \n        (-1) % 4 = 3, because 4 * (-1) = -4, and -1 - (-4) = 3.\n\n   But wait, is the modulus operation giving the same value as our conditional method?\n\n        Condition for t<current: n - current + t = 4-3+2=3, and (t-current)%n = 3.\n\n   Yes.\n\n   However, there's a caveat: what if the distance is 0? Then modulus gives 0, which is correct.\n\n   But wait: the modulus operation gives the remainder, and the remainder for (t - current) % n is in [0, n-1]. \n\n   However, note: the distance from current to t in a clockwise-only ring is defined as the smallest non-negative integer d such that (current + d) % n == t % n? \n\n   Actually, we are working in a ring of n houses, but note: the houses are numbered 1 to n. \n\n   But observe: the modulus operation we did is (t - current) % n. However, we are not using modulo arithmetic for the positions. The positions are absolute.\n\n   The issue: when we do (t - current) % n, we are assuming that the positions are modulo n? \n\n   But note: the positions are from 1 to n. The modulus operation for the distance is independent of the absolute position because we are only concerned with the circular arrangement.\n\n   However, there is a problem: the modulus operation (t - current) % n gives a value in [0, n-1]. But the actual distance we calculated in the conditional method is also in [0, n-1] (because if t>=current, then t-current is at most n-1 (if t=n and current=1, then n-1, which is valid); if t<current, then n-current+t is at most n-1 (when t=1 and current=n: n-n+1=1, which is valid).\n\n   Therefore, the modulus method gives the same result.\n\n   But wait: what if n=5, current=5, t=1?\n        Condition: 1<5 -> distance = 5-5+1 = 1.\n        Modulus: (1-5) % 5 = (-4) % 5 = 1 (since -4 + 5 = 1).\n\n   Correct.\n\n   However, what if n=5, current=5, t=2?\n        Condition: 2<5 -> distance = 5-5+2 = 2.\n        Modulus: (2-5)%5 = (-3)%5 = 2 (since -3+5=2).\n\n   Correct.\n\n   So we can use:\n\n        distance = (t - current) % n\n\n   But wait, what if t - current is negative and we add n, then we get a positive number. However, if we use modulus, we get the same.\n\n   However, note: the modulus operation for (t - current) is the same as (t - current + k*n) for any integer k such that the result is in [0, n-1]. But we want the minimal positive steps (which is the same as the modulus result).\n\n   But there's a catch: if we use modulus, then if (t - current) is negative, we are effectively adding n until positive. And that is the clockwise distance.\n\n   However, the problem states that the movement is only clockwise, so we must traverse the entire circle if necessary.\n\n   So we can write:\n\n        distance = (t - current) % n\n\n   But wait: what if (t - current) is negative? Then (t - current) % n is positive. And if (t - current) is positive, then (t - current) % n is just (t - current) (if t - current < n) or if t - current >= n, then we get a smaller number? \n\n   However, note: t and current are between 1 and n. Therefore, t - current is in the range [-n+1, n-1]. \n\n   Since n>=2, then the modulus operation will return a value in [0, n-1]. \n\n   But wait: if t - current is positive and greater than or equal to n, then modulus would reduce it. However, because t and current are in [1, n], the maximum difference is n-1 (if current=1 and t=n) and minimum is -(n-1) (if current=n and t=1). \n\n   Example: n=10, current=1, t=10: t-current=9, 9%10=9. Correct.\n\n   Example: n=10, current=1, t=11? But t is at most n, so t=10.\n\n   So the modulus method is valid.\n\n   However, note: the modulus method does not account for the fact that the distance must be non-negative and we are only allowed to move clockwise. But the modulus method gives the same result as the conditional method.\n\n   But wait: the conditional method uses the absolute value of the difference in the circular sense. The modulus method is the standard way to compute the clockwise distance in a circular buffer.\n\n   However, let me compare:\n\n        Condition method: \n            if t >= current: distance = t - current\n            else: distance = n - current + t\n\n        Modulus method: distance = (t - current) % n\n\n        Are they always the same?\n\n        Consider: \n            Case 1: t >= current -> then (t - current) is positive and less than n (because t<=n and current>=1, so t-current <= n-1). Then (t - current) % n = t - current.\n\n            Case 2: t < current -> then (t - current) is negative. Then (t - current) % n = (t - current + n) % n. But note: (t - current) is negative and |t - current| < n (because t>=1 and current<=n, so the gap is at most n-1). Then (t - current + n) is in [1, n-1] (because t>=1, current<=n, so t - current >= 1 - n, then t - current + n >= 1, and t - current + n <= n-1 + n? Actually, wait: t<current, so t - current is negative. The smallest t-curr is (1 - n) and the largest is (current_min - current_max) = 1 - n (if t=1, current=n). Then 1 - n + n = 1, and the maximum negative difference is (n-1) - 1? Wait, no: the worst-case negative is when t=1 and current=n: 1-n. Then 1-n+n=1.\n\n            But wait: the modulus operation for negative numbers in Python: \n                (a % n) = a - n * floor(a/n)\n\n            For a negative a, floor(a/n) is the smallest integer less than or equal to a/n (which is negative). \n\n            Alternatively, we can note that (t - current) % n = (t - current + n) % n, but if (t - current + n) is positive and less than n, then modulus doesn't change it.\n\n            And indeed, (t - current + n) is positive and less than n? \n\n            Since t < current, then t - current < 0, so t - current + n < n (because t - current < 0, so adding n gives a number less than n). And t - current + n is at least 1 (as shown above). So modulus doesn't change it.\n\n            Therefore, (t - current) % n = t - current + n.\n\n            But our condition method for t<current is: n - current + t, which is the same as t - current + n.\n\n        Therefore, the two methods are equivalent.\n\n   However, the modulus method is more concise.\n\n   But wait: what if the distance is exactly n? \n\n        Then (t - current) % n would be 0, meaning we don't move. But if t = current + n, then that would be the same house (because modulo n). But in our problem, t is between 1 and n, so t cannot be current+n (unless current=0, but current>=1). \n\n        Example: current=1, t=1+n: but n is the total houses, and t must be <=n. So t cannot be 1+n.\n\n   So the modulus method is safe.\n\n   We can write:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        current = 1\n        total = 0\n        for t in tasks:\n            # Calculate clockwise distance from current to t\n            distance = (t - current) % n\n            # But wait: if (t - current) is negative, then (t - current) % n is positive and equals t - current + n, which is the clockwise distance.\n            # However, if (t - current) is positive, then (t - current) % n is just the positive value (unless it's >=n, but we know t<=n and current>=1 so t-current<=n-1).\n            total += distance\n            current = t\n\n        print(total)\n\n   But wait, let's test with the example [3,2,3] for n=4:\n\n        Start: current=1, t=3: (3-1)%4 = 2%4=2 -> total=2, current=3.\n        Then t=2: (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4=3 -> total=5, current=2.\n        Then t=3: (3-2)%4=1%4=1 -> total=6.\n\n   Same result.\n\n   However, there's a problem: the modulus operation gives the same result as the condition, but note that the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers is defined as:\n\n        a % n = a - n * floor(a/n)\n\n   This is the same as the mathematical definition. \n\n   But wait: what if we have a very large n and the distance is 0? \n\n        Example: current=3, t=3: (3-3)%n=0, which is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if the distance is negative and we use modulus, we get a positive number, but the actual clockwise distance is positive. \n\n   Therefore, the modulus method is correct.\n\n   However, note: the modulus operation might be slightly faster than the condition? But the condition is two comparisons and one subtraction, and modulus is one operation. \n\n   But modulus for integers is efficient.\n\n   But wait: the modulus operation for negative numbers might be implemented with an if-check internally? \n\n   However, for clarity and conciseness, we can use the modulus method.\n\n   But note: there is a caveat. The modulus operation in Python for negative numbers is well-defined, but note that the distance we are calculating is the clockwise distance. The modulus operation gives the smallest non-negative residue, which is exactly the clockwise distance.\n\n   However, wait: is there any case where the modulus operation gives a different result than the condition? \n\n        Condition: \n            if t>=current: distance = t - current\n            else: distance = n - current + t\n\n        Modulus: distance = (t - current) % n\n\n        We have proven that for t>=current: (t - current) % n = t - current (if t - current < n, which is true because t<=n and current>=1, so t - current <= n-1).\n\n        For t<current: (t - current) % n = (t - current + n) % n. But since t - current is negative and |t - current| <= n-1, then t - current + n is in the range [1, n-1] (if t=1 and current=n: 1-n+n=1; if t=current-1: then t - current = -1, then -1+n = n-1). \n\n        So (t - current + n) is in [1, n-1] and modulo n (which is just the number itself) so (t - current) % n = t - current + n.\n\n        And the condition method for t<current is: n - current + t, which is the same as t - current + n.\n\n   Therefore, they are the same.\n\n   We can choose either.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the ringroad has n houses, and the houses are numbered 1 through n. The modulus operation is independent of the numbering system? \n\n   Actually, the modulus operation is defined on the integers. We are treating the houses as integers. But note: the modulus operation is linear. \n\n   But wait: the distance from current to t is defined in terms of the circular arrangement. The modulus operation is the standard way to compute the circular distance in a one-dimensional ring (if we ignore the fact that the houses are labeled 1..n and not 0..n-1). \n\n   However, we can adjust the labels: subtract 1 from every house to get 0-indexed, then the distance from current-1 to t-1 is (t-1 - (current-1)) % n, but then we have to be cautious because the modulus operation in 0-indexed would be the same.\n\n   But we don't need to adjust because the problem labels are 1-indexed and the modulus operation is defined for integers.\n\n   However, there is a known issue: sometimes people use (x - y) % n for the clockwise distance in a circle of n points (0-indexed). But here our points are 1-indexed.\n\n   But note: the distance from house 1 to house n in a ring of n houses (using modulus) is (n-1) % n? That would be n-1, but wait: from 1 to n, we don't need to go the entire circle? \n\n   Actually, in our condition method, from 1 to n: \n        n>=1 -> distance = n-1.\n\n   But modulus: (n-1)%n = n-1, correct.\n\n   From n to 1: \n        Condition: 1<n -> distance = n - n + 1 = 1.\n        Modulus: (1 - n) % n = (1 - n) % n = (1 - n + n) % n? Actually, (1-n) % n = 1 (because 1-n is negative, so we add n: 1-n+n = 1). Correct.\n\n   Therefore, the modulus method is correct.\n\n   However, wait: what if we use the modulus method and the distance is 0? That means we are already at the target. \n\n   But note: the modulus method gives 0 only when (t - current) is divisible by n. Since t and current are in [1, n], the only way (t - current) is divisible by n is if t==current. \n\n   So the modulus method is correct.\n\n   But note: the modulus operation might be considered less efficient for large numbers, but n and the differences are bounded by n (which is 10^5) and modulus is a constant-time operation.\n\n   We can use the modulus method.\n\n   However, let me check the performance: \n\n        For m=10^5, we do 10^5 modulus operations. \n\n       ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad in a clockwise direction. The key observation here is that Xenia can only move clockwise, and each move between adjacent houses takes one unit of time. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the order they are given. For each task, she needs to be at the specified house, having completed all previous tasks. The challenge is to calculate the total time taken by summing the distances between consecutive tasks, considering the circular nature of the ringroad.\n2. **Insight**: The distance between two houses `current` and `target` on a circular ringroad can be calculated using modulo arithmetic. Specifically, if `target` is greater than or equal to `current`, the distance is simply `target - current`. If `target` is less than `current`, the distance is `n - current + target`, which accounts for moving from `current` to the end of the ringroad and then to `target`.\n3. **Optimization**: Instead of using conditional checks for each task, we can leverage modulo operations to compute the distance efficiently. The formula `(target - current) % n` inherently handles both scenarios (whether `target` is ahead or behind `current` in the clockwise direction) by returning the correct positive distance.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    for t in tasks:\n        distance = (t - current) % n\n        total_time += distance\n        current = t\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of houses `n`, the number of tasks `m`, and the list of task locations.\n2. **Initialization**: We start with `current` set to house 1 (Xenia's starting point) and `total_time` set to 0.\n3. **Processing Tasks**: For each task location `t`:\n   - **Distance Calculation**: The distance from `current` to `t` is computed using `(t - current) % n`. This formula works because if `t` is greater than or equal to `current`, the result is `t - current` (direct path). If `t` is less than `current`, the result is `n - (current - t)`, effectively wrapping around the ringroad.\n   - **Update Total Time**: The computed distance is added to `total_time`.\n   - **Update Current Position**: After completing a task, `current` is updated to `t` for the next iteration.\n4. **Output**: The accumulated `total_time` is printed, representing the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the total travel time by leveraging modulo arithmetic, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
