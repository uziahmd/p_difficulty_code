He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed that the string only contains 'a','b','c'\n Conditions:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and note that C appends some number of 'c' (which is either the count of 'a' OR the count of 'b' OR both) but note: \n    - However, note the process: \n        - A gives a string of some 'a's.\n        - Then B appends some 'b's (so the string has an initial segment of 'a's and then a contiguous segment of 'b's? But note: the problem does not say that the entire string is just these three letters in order, but note the example: 'aabc' -> YES.\n\n Observation from examples:\n Example 1: \"aaabccc\" -> \n     Original A part: \"aaa\", then B appends \"b\", so now we have \"aaab\", then C appends 3 'c's (because the number of 'a' is 3, so he can append 3 c's). \n     But note: the condition says the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b'. Here, the number of 'a' is 3, number of 'b' is 1, and the number of 'c' is 3 -> so equals the number of 'a'.\n\n Example 2: \"bbacc\" -> NO. Why?\n     Let's break down: \n        The string is \"bbacc\". There is no 'a' at the beginning? Actually, there is an 'a' in the middle. But note the process: \n        - The string must be: [some 'a's] then [some 'b's] then [some 'c's]. However, here we have two 'b's, then an 'a', then two 'c's. This breaks the order.\n\n So the key conditions are:\n   Condition 1: The string must have the following structure: \n        - All the 'a's must come first, then all the 'b's, then all the 'c's. If there's any 'a' after a 'b' or a 'c', or any 'b' after a 'c', then it's invalid.\n\n   Condition 2: The counts must satisfy: \n        Let nA = count of 'a'\n        Let nB = count of 'b'\n        Let nC = count of 'c'\n\n        Then, we require that nC is either nA or nB (or both). \n\n   However, note: the problem states that the process is:\n        - A gives a string of 'a's (so initially only 'a's)\n        - Then B appends 'b's (so after the initial 'a's, we have 'b's) and then C appends 'c's.\n\n   Therefore, the string must be non-decreasing in the sense: \n        - No 'a' appears after a 'b' or 'c'\n        - No 'b' appears after a 'c'\n\n   So we can check for the order: the string should be such that the characters are in non-decreasing order? Actually, we want:\n        - All the 'a's (if any) must be at the beginning, then all the 'b's (if any), then all the 'c's (if any).\n\n   But note: what if there are no 'b's? Then the string is just 'a's and 'c's? But wait: the problem says that B appends some number of 'b's (at least one). Similarly, C appends some number of 'c's (which is determined by the counts of 'a' or 'b'). However, note the condition: \"at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string\" after B's step. Then C appends. So the final string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and at least one 'c'? Not necessarily: because C appends at least one 'c'? \n\n   Let me read again: \n        - B appends some number of letters 'b' (so at least one, because \"at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist\"). \n        - C appends some number of letters 'c' (equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' in the string at that time). \n\n   However, note: when C appends, the string at that time (after B) has the original A's 'a's and B's appended 'b's. So the counts of 'a' and 'b' are fixed at that point. Then C appends either nA or nB (or both) of 'c's. So the total string will have at least one 'a', one 'b', and at",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by the specific process described. The process involves three steps: A provides a string of 'a's, B appends some 'b's, and C appends a number of 'c's equal to either the count of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point. The solution involves checking two main conditions: the order of characters in the string and the counts of each character.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Character Order**: The string must consist of a sequence of 'a's followed by 'b's followed by 'c's. Any deviation from this order (e.g., an 'a' after a 'b' or 'c', or a 'b' after a 'c') makes the string invalid.\n2. **Check Character Counts**: The number of 'c's in the string must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. Additionally, the string must contain at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c' to satisfy the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    \n    # Check if the string has the correct order: all 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's.\n    if 'b' in s and 'c' in s:\n        idx_b = s.find('b')\n        idx_c = s.find('c')\n        if idx_c < idx_b:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n    # Check for the presence of at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'\n    if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    # Check the condition on the number of 'c's\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Character Order Check**: The code first checks if the string contains both 'b' and 'c'. If it does, it verifies that all 'c's appear before any 'b's. This ensures the string follows the required sequence of 'a's followed by 'b's followed by 'c's.\n2. **Presence Check**: The code then checks if the string contains at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. If any of these characters are missing, the string is invalid.\n3. **Count Condition**: Finally, the code checks if the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. If this condition is met, the string is valid; otherwise, it is invalid.\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the string's validity by ensuring both the correct character order and the specified count conditions.",
