Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering that removing one element might help us avoid either the minimum or the maximum value.\n Since the instability is defined as (max - min), we can consider two cases for each element removal:\n   - Removing an element that is the current global minimum, then the new minimum becomes the next smallest element and the maximum remains the same (if the maximum appears at least once).\n   - Similarly, removing an element that is the current global maximum, then the new maximum becomes the next largest element and the minimum remains the same.\n\n However, note that sometimes the array might have duplicate values. Therefore, we can think of:\n\n Let's sort the array. Then, if we remove an element, the resulting array's min and max will be:\n   - If we remove an element at index i (0-indexed) in the sorted array, then:\n        new_min = a[0] if i != 0 else a[1]\n        new_max = a[-1] if i != n-1 else a[-2]\n\n But note: what if we remove an element that is not the min or max? Then the min and max remain the same.\n\n Actually, we can consider that the only way to reduce the instability is to remove an extreme (min or max). However, sometimes removing a non-extreme might not help, but wait:\n\n Example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. \n   Original instability: 4.\n   Removing 1: [2,3,4,5] -> instability 3.\n   Removing 5: [1,2,3,4] -> instability 3.\n   Removing any middle element: still 4.\n\n So the idea is: we only need to consider removals of the first k elements (where k=0 and k=n-1) because:\n\n But note: sometimes we might have duplicates. For example, [1, 1, 2, 3]:\n   Original: min=1, max=3 -> instability 2.\n   Removing a 1: [1,2,3] -> instability 2.\n   Removing the other 1: same.\n   Removing 2: [1,1,3] -> instability 2.\n   Removing 3: [1,1,2] -> instability 1.\n\n So the above example shows that removing an element that is not the extreme (min or max) can also help? Actually, no: in this case, the extremes are the two 1's and the 3. Removing a non-extreme (the 2) doesn't change the min or max, so the instability remains 2.\n\n However, note: the example [1, 1, 2, 3] has two 1's and one 3. The min is 1 and the max is 3. When we remove the 2, the min is still 1 and the max is still 3.\n\n But wait, what if we remove the last occurrence of the min? Then the new min is the next distinct number? Actually, no: the array is [1, 1, 2, 3]. The min is 1 and the next smallest after removing one occurrence of 1 is still 1 (because there's another 1). Similarly, the max is 3 and the next largest if we remove 3 is 2.\n\n However, the key is: the instability is determined by the entire set of numbers. So if we remove an element that is not the current min, the min might stay the same (if there are duplicates). Similarly for the max.\n\n Therefore, we can reframe the problem:\n\n After sorting the array, the overall instability of the entire array is a[-1] - a[0].\n\n Now, when we remove one element, we are effectively considering contiguous segments that skip one element? Actually, we can consider:\n\n   Option 1: Remove the first element (a[0]): then the new instability is a[n-2] - a[1] (if n>=2)\n   Option 2: Remove the last element (a[n-1]): then the new instability is a[n-2] - a[0] (if n>=2)\n\n But wait, what if we remove an element in the middle? Then the min and max remain a[0] and a[n-1] unless the removed element is the only occurrence of the min or the max.\n\n However, if we remove an element that is the min (but not the first one) then the min remains the same until we remove all min? Actually, if we remove an element that is a[0] (the smallest) then the new smallest is a[1]. Similarly, if we remove an element that is the largest (a[n-1]), then the new largest is a[n-2].\n\n But what if we remove an element that is not the smallest or the largest? Then the min",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in efficiently determining the potential new minima and maxima after removing any element.\n2. **Key Insight**: Removing an element from the sorted array can only affect the instability if the removed element is either the current minimum or maximum. However, even if the removed element is not the extreme, the instability might still change if there are duplicates or other edge cases.\n3. **Evaluate Removal of Extremes**: For each possible removal of the first or last element in the sorted array, compute the new instability. The minimum instability among all these scenarios (including removals of non-extreme elements) is our answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    best = float('inf')\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if i == 0:\n            new_min = a[1] if n > 1 else float('inf')\n            new_max = a[-1]\n        elif i == n-1:\n            new_min = a[0]\n            new_max = a[-2] if n > 1 else -float('inf')\n        else:\n            new_min = a[0]\n            new_max = a[-1]\n        \n        current_instability = new_max - new_min\n        if current_instability < best:\n            best = current_instability\n            \n    print(best)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of elements and the array itself.\n2. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n3. **Iterating Through Elements**: For each element in the sorted array, simulate its removal and calculate the new instability:\n   - If the removed element is the first element, the new minimum becomes the next element in the array (or infinity if the array had only one element).\n   - If the removed element is the last element, the new maximum becomes the previous element in the array (or negative infinity if the array had only one element).\n   - For any other element, the min and max remain unchanged.\n4. **Tracking Minimum Instability**: During each iteration, the current instability is compared with the best (minimum) instability found so far, updating the best value if necessary.\n5. **Output Result**: After processing all elements, the minimum instability value is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible single-element removals and ensures the solution is optimal with a time complexity dominated by the sorting step, O(n log n), which is efficient for the given constraints.",
