Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two strings `l` and `r` of length n (n up to 150000). Each string contains lowercase Latin letters or '?'\n We need to form as many pairs as possible (each boot in at most one pair) such that:\n   - Two specific colors are compatible if they are the same.\n   - An indefinite color '?' is compatible with any color.\n\n However, note: the problem requires to output the maximum number of pairs and then the pairs themselves (with indices).\n\n Approach:\n\n We can break down the problem into two parts:\n  1. Matching fixed colors (non '?') on both sides.\n  2. Handling the remaining boots (which might be fixed or '?') for additional matches.\n\n But note: a '?' can act as a wildcard. However, we cannot use the same boot twice.\n\n Steps:\n\n Idea 1: First, we can try to match all the non '?' left boots with non '?' right boots if the colors match.\n Then, we can also consider matching the remaining left boots (which are either fixed or '?') with the remaining right boots.\n\n However, note: if we have a '?' on the left, it can match any right boot (including fixed ones and '?') and vice versa.\n\n But wait: we cannot assign a '?' to match multiple things. Also, we must maximize the total pairs.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Since the problem has two types: fixed and wildcard, we can do:\n\n Step 1: Count the frequency of each letter in the left and right, but also separate the wildcards.\n\n However, note: the matching is one-to-one and the wildcards can be used arbitrarily.\n\n We can consider:\n\n  Let's denote:\n    L_fixed: list of non '?' characters in l (with their index)\n    L_wild: list of indices where l[i] == '?'\n\n    Similarly, R_fixed: list of non '?' characters in r (with their index)\n    R_wild: list of indices where r[i] == '?' \n\n Then, we can first match the fixed ones:\n\n  For each color c, let:\n      countL[c] = number of fixed left boots with color c (excluding wildcards)\n      countR[c] = number of fixed right boots with color c\n\n  Then, for each color c, we can match min(countL[c], countR[c]) pairs.\n\n  But note: the fixed boots are at specific indices. We need to record which indices are used.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n  We can create two arrays for left and right, and mark the ones that are fixed and the ones that are wild.\n\n  Then, we can first remove the fixed ones that can be matched by color.\n\n  However, we also have to account for the fact that the wildcards can be used to match any remaining fixed boot? \n\n  Actually, the problem is: we want the maximum number of pairs.\n\n  The maximum pairs cannot exceed n, and we can use wildcards to fill in the gaps.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  1. Create two arrays: one for left and one for right, storing the color and the index.\n\n  2. We will try to form as many pairs as possible from the fixed boots. How?\n        We can do: \n            For each color c (from 'a' to 'z'), we know how many left fixed boots have c and how many right fixed boots have c.\n            Then, we can match min(L_fixed_count[c], R_fixed_count[c]) for each color.\n\n        However, we must assign specific indices. So we need to store the indices for fixed boots.\n\n  3. But note: the same index cannot be used twice.\n\n  Alternatively, we can think greedily:\n\n  We can form pairs in two ways:\n      a) Fixed vs Fixed: only when the colors match.\n      b) Fixed vs Wildcard: the wildcard can match any fixed color (and vice versa).\n      c) Wildcard vs Wildcard: a wildcard can match another wildcard.\n\n  However, note: the problem says an indefinite color is compatible with any color. So:\n\n      - A fixed color 'a' can be matched with a fixed color 'a', a wildcard, or even a wildcard on the other side (but wait, the other side's wildcard doesn't matter because the fixed is already specific).\n\n  But wait, what if we have:\n\n        Left: \"a?\"\n        Right: \"?a\"\n\n      Then, the '?' in left can match the '?' in right, and then the 'a' in left must match the 'a' in right? Actually, no: the two boots are independent. But note: we are pairing one left with one right.\n\n      Actually, each pair is one left and one right. So:\n\n          We have two boots on left: [index1: 'a', index2: '?']\n          We have two boots on right: [index1: '?', index2: 'a']\n\n         ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs between left and right boots, where each boot can be part of at most one pair. The compatibility is defined such that two specific colors must be identical, while an indefinite color ('?') can match any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves matching two strings (left and right boots) of length `n` where each character can be a lowercase Latin letter or a '?'. The goal is to form the maximum number of pairs where each pair consists of one left and one right boot with compatible colors.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves categorizing the boots into fixed (specific color) and wildcard (?) categories. We first match all fixed boots of the same color. Then, we handle the remaining boots by leveraging wildcards to form additional pairs.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Fixed Boots Matching**: For each color, count the occurrences in both left and right boots. Match the minimum of these counts for each color.\n   - **Wildcard Handling**: After matching fixed boots, the remaining boots (both fixed and wildcard) can be matched using wildcards. Wildcards can match any remaining boot (fixed or wildcard), thus maximizing the number of pairs.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each character in the strings once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the strings.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data: \n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    l_str = data[1].strip()\n    r_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    left_fixed = []\n    left_wild = []\n    for i, char in enumerate(l_str):\n        if char == '?':\n            left_wild.append(i+1)\n        else:\n            left_fixed.append((char, i+1))\n            \n    right_fixed = []\n    right_wild = []\n    for i, char in enumerate(r_str):\n        if char == '?':\n            right_wild.append(i+1)\n        else:\n            right_fixed.append((char, i+1))\n            \n    fixed_left = {}\n    for char, idx in left_fixed:\n        fixed_left[char] = fixed_left.get(char, []) + [idx]\n        \n    fixed_right = {}\n    for char, idx in right_fixed:\n        fixed_right[char] = fixed_right.get(char, []) + [idx]\n        \n    matches = []\n    used_left = set()\n    used_right = set()\n    \n    for color in fixed_left:\n        if color in fixed_right:\n            left_list = fixed_left[color]\n            right_list = fixed_right[color]\n            i = 0\n            j = 0\n            while i < len(left_list) and j < len(right_list):\n                left_idx = left_list[i]\n                right_idx = right_list[j]\n                if left_idx not in used_left and right_idx not in used_right:\n                    matches.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n                    used_left.add(left_idx)\n                    used_right.add(right_idx)\n                    i += 1\n                    j += 1\n                elif left_idx in used_left:\n                    i += 1\n                else:\n                    j += 1\n                    \n    remaining_left = []\n    for char, idx in left_fixed:\n        if idx not in used_left:\n            remaining_left.append(idx)\n            \n    remaining_right = []\n    for char, idx in right_fixed:\n        if idx not in used_right:\n            remaining_right.append(idx)\n            \n    total_remaining = len(remaining_left) + len(remaining_right)\n    num_pairs_remaining = min(total_remaining // 2, len(left_wild) + len(right_wild))\n    remaining_needed = num_pairs_remaining * 2\n    \n    remaining_left.extend(left_wild)\n    remaining_right.extend(right_wild)\n    \n    remaining_left.sort()\n    remaining_right.sort()\n    \n    wild_left = remaining_left[:len(left_wild)]\n    wild_right = remaining_right[:len(right_wild)]\n    \n    left_indices = remaining_left[len(left_wild):]\n    right_indices = remaining_right[len(right_wild):]\n    \n    pairs_from_wild = []\n    i = 0\n    j = 0\n    while i < len(wild_left) and j < len(wild_right):\n        pairs_from_wild.append((wild_left[i], wild_right[j]))\n        i += 1\n        j += 1\n        \n    if len(left_indices) > len(right_indices):\n        left_indices = left_indices[:len(right_indices)]\n    else:\n        right_indices = right_indices[:len(left_indices)]\n        \n    for i in range(len(left_indices)):\n        pairs_from_wild.append((left_indices[i], right_indices[i]))\n        \n    matches.extend(pairs_from_wild)\n    matches.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n    \n    k = len(matches)\n    print(k)\n    for pair in matches:\n        print(pair[0], pair[1])\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of boots `n`, followed by two strings representing left and right boots.\n2. **Categorizing Boots**: Boots are categorized into fixed (specific color) and wildcard (?) types, storing their indices.\n3. **Matching Fixed Boots**: For each color, the algorithm matches the minimum count of left and right fixed boots, marking them as used.\n4. **Handling Remaining Boots**: The remaining fixed and wildcard boots are processed to form additional pairs. Wildcards can match any remaining boot, ensuring maximum pairs.\n5. **Output**: The total number of pairs is printed, followed by each pair's indices (left boot index and right boot index).\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the number of compatible pairs by leveraging both fixed color matches and wildcard flexibility, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
