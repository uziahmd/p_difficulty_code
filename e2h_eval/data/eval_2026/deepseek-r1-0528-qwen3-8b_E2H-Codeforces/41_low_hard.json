There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given n, h, m and then m lines of restrictions [l_i, r_i, x_i]\n Since n, m, h are at most 50, we can use dynamic programming or try to assign heights satisfying all constraints.\n\n However, note: the profit function is a^2 for each house. The goal is to maximize the total profit.\n\n The challenge is that we have multiple overlapping restrictions. Each restriction imposes a maximum height on a contiguous segment.\n\n Observation:\n 1. Without restrictions, we would set every house to height h (since a^2 is increasing with a, and we can go up to h).\n 2. But the restrictions say that in some segments the maximum height must be <= some x_i (which could be less than h).\n\n How to handle?\n We can think of it as: we must choose an assignment of heights for each spot (each from 0 to h) such that for every restriction i (with interval [l_i, r_i] and maximum x_i), the maximum height in that interval is <= x_i.\n\n Since the constraints are small (n, m <= 50) but the numbers are small (heights from 0 to h, and h<=50) we can consider using DP that considers the restrictions.\n\n Alternatively, note that the restrictions might conflict. But actually, if two restrictions overlap, then the actual height in that area must be <= the minimum of the restrictions' x_i for the overlapping parts? Actually, no: each restriction applies independently. However, if two restrictions apply to overlapping intervals, then the house in the overlap must satisfy both restrictions. Therefore, for a particular house j, its height a_j must be at most the minimum x_i over all restrictions that cover j.\n\n But wait: is that sufficient? Actually, yes. Because each restriction requires that the maximum in its interval is <= x_i. Therefore, if a house j is covered by several restrictions, then its height must be <= the minimum x_i among those that cover j. However, note that we can also set a house lower than that minimum, but we want to maximize the profit so we would set it to the minimum.\n\n However, caution: it's not that simple because the restriction might require that the entire interval has maximum <= x_i, so even if one house is set to the minimum x_i, the other houses in the interval must be <= that x_i. But if we set each house to the minimum x_i of all restrictions covering it, then we are satisfying all restrictions? Yes, because any house is constrained by all the restrictions that cover it, and setting it to the minimum x_i (or even lower) will satisfy all restrictions that cover it.\n\n But note: there might be a restriction that doesn't cover a house, then we don't have to worry about that restriction for that house. And the overall constraint for the entire street is the maximum allowed by the restrictions and the global h.\n\n However, we must remember that the problem does not require that we only use the restrictions. We can set a house to any value between 0 and min(h, x_i) for the restrictions that cover it, but note: if a house is not covered by any restriction, then we can set it to h.\n\n Therefore, we can compute for each house j:\n   Let M_j = min( { h } ∪ { x_i | the restriction i covers j } )\n\n Then the maximum height we can assign to house j is M_j. Then we set house j to M_j to maximize the profit.\n\n But wait: is that always optimal? Consider: sometimes, if we set a house to a lower value, we might relax the constraints for the neighboring houses? Actually, no: the constraints are independent per restriction. The only thing that matters for house j is that the restriction covering j must have the entire interval <= x_i. So if we set house j to M_j (the minimum of all x_i covering j and h) then we are satisfying all restrictions that cover j. And for restrictions that do not cover j, they are satisfied by the other houses.\n\n However, there is a catch: the same restriction applies to multiple houses. But note, the above M_j is the maximum allowed for house j. Then the entire interval of a restriction must have houses <= x_i. But if we set each house j to M_j (which is <= x_i for every restriction i that covers j) then indeed the entire interval [l_i, r_i] for restriction i will have all houses <= x_i (because each house j in [l_i, r_i] has M_j <= x_i). \n\n Therefore, we can compute for each spot j the maximum allowed height, call it a_j = min( h, min_{i: j in [l_i, r_i]} x_i ) (if there's no restriction, then a_j = h).\n\n Then the profit for house j is a_j^2.\n\n Then total profit = sum",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street with specific zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses built on each spot. Each house's height must comply with all restrictions that apply to its spot, and the height cannot exceed the given maximum height `h`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that for each spot, the maximum allowable height is constrained by the most restrictive zoning restriction (i.e., the smallest `x_i` value) that includes that spot. Additionally, the height cannot exceed the global maximum height `h`.\n2. **Insight**: For each spot, determine the minimum `x_i` value among all restrictions covering it. This value, along with `h`, gives the maximum height permissible for that spot. The optimal height for each spot is then the minimum of this value and `h`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We process each spot individually. For each spot, we check all restrictions to find those that include the spot. The minimum `x_i` from these restrictions, if any, is used along with `h` to determine the maximum allowable height for the spot.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Given the constraints (n, m ≤ 50), the solution efficiently checks each spot against all restrictions, resulting in a time complexity of O(n*m), which is feasible for the problem's constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    h = int(data[1])\n    m = int(data[2])\n    \n    restrictions = []\n    index = 3\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l_i = int(data[index])\n        r_i = int(data[index+1])\n        x_i = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        restrictions.append((l_i, r_i, x_i))\n    \n    max_allowed = [h] * n\n    \n    for l_i, r_i, x_i in restrictions:\n        for j in range(l_i-1, r_i):\n            if x_i < max_allowed[j]:\n                max_allowed[j] = x_i\n                \n    total_profit = 0\n    for height in max_allowed:\n        total_profit += height * height\n        \n    print(total_profit)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into integers `n` (number of spots), `h` (maximum height), and `m` (number of restrictions). The subsequent lines are stored as tuples representing each restriction's parameters.\n2. **Initialization**: An array `max_allowed` is initialized with the global maximum height `h` for each spot.\n3. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, the code checks all spots within its range `[l_i, r_i]`. For each spot in this range, the `max_allowed` value is updated to the minimum between its current value and the restriction's `x_i`.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: After processing all restrictions, the profit is calculated by summing the squares of the `max_allowed` values for each spot.\n5. **Output**: The total profit is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that all zoning restrictions are respected while maximizing the profit by leveraging the constraints to determine the optimal height for each spot.",
