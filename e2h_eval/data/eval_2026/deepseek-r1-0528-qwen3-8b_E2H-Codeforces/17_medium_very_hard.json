He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, Ivan has given us a string of length n and we know all the proper prefixes and suffixes (each length from 1 to n-1 has two strings: one prefix and one suffix). However, the order is arbitrary.\n\n We are guaranteed that there are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1, and they are the actual prefixes and suffixes of some string of length n.\n\n The problem: We must assign each input string as either 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix) such that:\n   - There are exactly n-1 'P' and n-1 'S'\n   - The set of prefixes (of the guessed string) and the set of suffixes (of the same guessed string) are exactly the given ones.\n\n But note: we don't know which is which. Also, we are told that at least one string is consistent.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Observation: Since the string s of length n has:\n   - Prefixes: s[0:1], s[0:2], ..., s[0:n-1]\n   - Suffixes: s[1:], s[2:], ..., s[n-1:]   [Note: in the example, the string \"ababa\" has prefixes \"a\", \"ab\", \"aba\", \"abab\" and suffixes \"ba\", \"aba\", \"baba\", \"ababa\" but wait: the problem says proper, so for n=5, we have lengths 1 to 4. So the full string is not included.]\n\n However, note: the example input for n=5 includes:\n   Input: \n      5\n      ba\n      a\n      abab\n      a\n      aba\n      baba\n      ab\n      aba\n\n But wait, there are two 'a' and three 'aba'? Actually, let's read carefully: the next 2n-2 lines (which is 8 lines) contain the strings. And there are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1 (so two strings of length 1, two of length 2, two of length 3, two of length 4).\n\n In the example, the two strings of length 1: ['a', 'a']? Actually, the input has two 'a'. Then two of length 2: ['ba','ab']? But wait, the input has:\n   Line1: 5\n   Line2: ba\n   Line3: a\n   Line4: a\n   Line5: abab\n   Line6: a\n   Line7: aba\n   Line8: baba\n   Line9: ab   -> wait, no, the example input is given as:\n\n        ['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba']\n\n Actually, the example input is provided as a list of strings for different test cases. But the problem says: the first line is n, then 2n-2 lines.\n\n Let me parse the example:\n\n Example 1: n=5, then 8 lines: \n   \"ba\"\n   \"a\"\n   \"abab\"\n   \"a\"\n   \"aba\"\n   \"baba\"\n   \"ab\"\n   \"aba\"\n\n But wait, that gives two 'a' (two of length 1) and then two of length 2: \"ba\" and \"ab\", two of length 3: \"aba\" and \"aba\"? That can't be because the problem states that there are two strings for each length. Actually, the example input has two 'a' (length1) and then two 'aba' (length3) and two 'abab' (length4) and two 'baba' (length4) but wait, the fourth string is \"a\", and then we have two 'aba' and two 'baba' and two 'ab' (wait, the seventh is \"ab\", which is length2). \n\n Actually, the example input is:\n\n    5\n    ba   -> length2\n    a    -> length1\n    a    -> length1\n    abab -> length4\n    a    -> This is the fifth line, but wait, we already have two length1, then two length2, then two length3, then two length4? Let's count:\n\n    Lines 2 to 9 (8 lines):\n\n        Line2: \"ba\" -> length2\n        Line3: \"a\"  -> length1\n        Line4: \"a\"  -> length1\n        Line5: \"abab\" -> length4\n        Line6: \"a\" -> wait, this is the third 'a'? But we have two strings of length1, so this must be an error? \n\n Wait, actually the example input is provided as:\n\n        ['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba']\n\n So if we split by lines, we get:\n\n        Line0: \"5\"\n        Line1: \"ba\"\n        Line2: \"a\"\n        Line3: \"abab\"\n        Line4: \"a\"\n        Line5: \"aba\"\n        Line6: \"baba\"\n        Line7: \"ab\"\n        Line8: \"aba\"\n\n But wait, there are 9 lines? Actually, the example input is given as a list of strings for multiple test cases. But the problem says: the first line is n, then 2n-2 lines.\n\n However, in the example, the first test case is:\n\n        Input: \n          5\n          ba\n          a\n          abab\n          a\n          aba\n          baba\n          ab\n          aba\n\n But wait, that is 1 + 8 = 9 lines? Actually, the problem says: the first line is n, then 2n-2 lines. So for n=5, 2n-2=8. So the input should have 9 lines? Actually, no: the first line is n, then the next 2n-2 lines. So total lines: 1 + (2n-2) = 2n-1.\n\n But the example input is given as:\n\n        ['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba']\n\n This is one string that contains 5, then 8 more lines. So the entire input for the first test case is 9 lines.\n\n However, the example output is 'SPPSPSPS'\n\n How do we solve?\n\n Idea:\n\n Since we know the string s of length n must have the following properties:\n\n   Let s = x0 x1 ... x_{n-1}\n\n   Then the prefixes are: \n        p1 = x0\n        p2 = x0x1\n        p3 = x0x1x2\n        ...\n        p_{n-1} = x0x1...x_{n-2}\n\n   The suffixes are:\n        s1 = x1x2...x_{n-1}\n        s2 = x2...x_{n-1}\n        ...\n        s_{n-1} = x_{n-1}\n\n Now, note that the prefix of length k and the suffix of length k must share some relation.\n\n Consider: \n   The prefix of length k is s[0:k]\n   The suffix of length k is s[k:n]   [if we consider 0-indexed, then the suffix of length k is s[n-k:n]? Actually, no: the suffix of length k is the last k characters, i.e., s[-k:]]\n\n But wait, the problem says: \n        suffixes: for a string of length n, the suffixes are the substrings starting from index 1 to the end (for length n-1) down to the last character.\n\n Actually, standard definition: \n        prefix of length k: s[0:k]\n        suffix of length k: s[n-k:n]\n\n Now, consider the condition: the entire string s must be consistent with the given set.\n\n However, we don't know which string is which. But note: the set of given strings is exactly the set of prefixes and suffixes.\n\n Alternate idea: \n\n   We are guaranteed that there is at least one string that is consistent.\n\n   We can try to recover the entire string s. Since we have two strings of each length, and the string s must be built such that its prefixes and suffixes are in the given set.\n\n   But note: the two strings of a given length might not be independent.\n\n   Let L be the list of 2n-2 strings, grouped by length.\n\n   For length 1: two strings. One must be the first character of s, and the other must be the last character of s? Not necessarily: the first character is the prefix of length1, and the last character is the suffix of length1. However, the two strings of length1 must be distinct? Or can they be the same? The example n=2: input is ['a','c'].\n\n   But the example n=2: \n        Input: \n            2\n            a\n            c\n\n        Output: 'PS'\n\n        But wait, the string could be \"ac\" or \"ca\". In the case of \"ac\": \n            prefixes: \"a\" (from \"ac\")\n            suffixes: \"c\" (from \"ac\")\n        In the case of \"ca\":\n            prefixes: \"c\"\n            suffixes: \"a\"\n\n        So the assignment: \n            If we assign the first string \"a\" as prefix and \"c\" as suffix, then the string is \"ac\".\n            Or the first string \"a\" as suffix and \"c\" as prefix, then the string is \"ca\".\n\n        So both assignments are valid.\n\n   How to decide?\n\n   We can use the fact that the entire string must satisfy that the prefix of length k and the suffix of length k overlap in the middle.\n\n   Specifically, consider the entire string s. Then the prefix of length k and the suffix of length k must satisfy:\n\n        Let P_k = s[0:k]\n        Let S_k = s[n-k:n]   (last k characters)\n\n        Also, the prefix of length k+1 is s[0:k+1] = P_k + s[k]\n        The suffix of length k+1 is s[n-(k+1):n] = s[n-k-1:n] = s[n-k-1] + S_k   [if we break it down]\n\n        However, note: the suffix of length k+1 is the substring from index n-k-1 to the end, so it is s[n-k-1] followed by S_k (which is of length k).\n\n        But also, the prefix of length k+1 is P_k (length k) plus the next character, which is s[k].\n\n        Now, the entire string s has length n, so the next character after the prefix of length k is the same as the character at position k, and the suffix of length k+1 must start with that same character? Actually, no: the suffix of length k+1 is the substring from n-k-1 to the end, and the prefix of length k+1 is from 0 to k. These two do not necessarily share a common part.\n\n   However, note: the prefix of length k and the suffix of length k must be compatible with the same string.\n\n   Another idea: \n\n        The entire string s must be such that the prefix of length k (say A) and the suffix of length k (say B) must satisfy that the first character of B is the last character of A? \n\n        Actually, the entire string s is built from the prefixes. But also, the suffix of length k is the last k characters, and the prefix of length k is the first k. The two sets must cover the entire string.\n\n        Consider the overlapping between consecutive layers.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try to build the string s by aligning the given prefixes and suffixes.\n\n   Steps:\n\n     1. Group the input strings by their lengths.\n\n     2. We know that the string s must have two sets: \n          P = { s[0:1], s[0:2], ..., s[0:n-1] }\n          S = { s[1:], s[2:], ..., s[n-1:] }\n\n     3. Note: the prefix of length k and the suffix of length k must satisfy: the suffix of length k is the last k characters, and the prefix of length k is the first k.\n\n        Also, the prefix of length k must end with the first character of the suffix of length 1 (which is the last character of s). \n\n        Similarly, the suffix of length k must start with the last character of the prefix of length 1 (which is the same as the last character of s).\n\n     4. Therefore, the two strings of length1 must be the first character and the last character of s. And they must be different if n>=2? Actually, they can be the same. For example, if n=3 and s=\"aaa\", then the two length1 strings are both \"a\". Then the assignment is: one must be prefix and one must be suffix, but they are the same.\n\n     5. How to assign?\n\n        We can consider: the entire string s must be constructed from the two sets. We can try to find the candidate for the full string.\n\n        However, note: we are only required to output a string of 'P' and 'S' of length 2n-2 (with n-1 'P' and n-1 'S').\n\n        There might be multiple solutions, but we can choose any.\n\n        Another observation: \n\n          The prefix of length k and the suffix of length k must have the property that the prefix of length k ends with the same character as the suffix of length k starts? Actually, no, because the prefix of length k is the first k, and the suffix of length k is the last k, and they are adjacent at the middle if k is chosen appropriately.\n\n        Actually, consider the entire string s. The prefix of length k is s[0:k] and the suffix of length k is s[n-k:n]. The two sets must cover the entire string. Moreover, the prefix of length k and the suffix of length k must be such that the entire string is the prefix of length n (which we don't have) but we can use the fact that the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 together can form the entire string?\n\n        Specifically, the entire string s is the prefix of length n (which we don't have) but we have the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1. The prefix of length n-1 is s[0:n-1] and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1:n]. Then the entire string s is: \n            s = (prefix of length n-1) + (last character) \n            But the last character is the suffix of length1.\n\n        Alternatively, from the suffix of length n-1, we have s[1:n]. The first character is missing. But we have the prefix of length1: that's the first character.\n\n        Similarly, the entire string s can be written as:\n            s = (prefix of length1) + (the rest of the string except the last character) \n            and the rest of the string except the last character is the prefix of length n-2? Actually, the prefix of length n-1 is the first n-1 characters, which is (prefix of length1) + (the next n-2 characters). And the next n-2 characters must match the first n-2 characters of the suffix of length n-1.\n\n        However, we don't know which string is which.\n\n        Alternate approach: \n\n        We can use the following: \n\n          Let F be the set of prefixes (to be determined) and G the set of suffixes.\n\n          Conditions:\n\n            Condition 1: The two strings of length1: one must be the first character and the other the last character.\n\n            Condition 2: The prefix of length k and the suffix of length k must be such that the entire string s can be built.\n\n          But note: the problem does not require to recover s, only to assign labels.\n\n        We can use the following greedy:\n\n          Step 1: Group the input by length.\n\n          Step 2: Start from the largest length (n-1) and go down.\n\n          However, note: the two strings of length n-1: one is the prefix of length n-1 (so the entire string without the last character) and the other is the suffix of length n-1 (the entire string without the first character).\n\n          Then, the entire string s must be: \n              s = (prefix of length n-1) + (last character) \n              and the last character is the suffix of length1.\n\n          But also, the entire string s must be: \n              s = (first character) + (suffix of length n-1)\n\n          And the first character is the prefix of length1.\n\n          Therefore, the two strings of length n-1 must be such that:\n\n              prefix_{n-1} = s[0:n-1] = (prefix_1) + s[1:n-1]   [but we don't know s[1:n-1]]\n\n          Alternatively, we can consider the two strings of length n-1: let A and B.\n\n          Then, the entire string s must be A + (some char) and also B must be s[1:n] (which is the entire string without the first char). But note: the entire string s is of length n, so:\n\n              s = A + c   (where c is the last character)\n              and also s = d + B   (where d is the first character)\n\n          Then, we have:\n\n              A + c = d + B\n\n          And we know from the length1 group: we have two strings, say x and y. Then one of them is d (the first char) and the other is c (the last char).\n\n          Therefore, we have two possibilities:\n\n              Possibility 1: d = x, c = y -> then A + y = x + B\n              Possibility 2: d = y, c = x -> then A + x = y + B\n\n          But note: A and B are two given strings of length n-1.\n\n          How can we check? \n\n          We can try both possibilities and see which one makes the entire string consistent? But we don't know the entire set.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use the fact that the entire string must also satisfy the condition for intermediate lengths.\n\n        However, note the problem: we are only required to output any valid assignment.\n\n        Another idea: \n\n          We can assume that the two strings of length n-1 are the two candidates for the two parts of the entire string. Then, the entire string s must be one of:\n\n            candidate1 = A + y   (if we take d=x, c=y) and candidate2 = y + B   (from the equation: A+y = x+B -> so candidate1 = x+B and candidate2 = A+x? Actually, we have two equations: A+y = x+B, so the entire string must be A+y and also x+B, so they must be equal.\n\n          Therefore, we must have A+y = x+B.\n\n          Similarly, for possibility2: A+x = y+B.\n\n          Now, we can check which of these holds. But note: we don't know which string is A and which is B (the two strings of length n-1). So we have two pairs to check:\n\n            Check1: For the two strings of length n-1, let A and B be the two, and the two strings of length1, x and y. Then check if A + y == x + B.\n\n            Check2: Check if A + x == y + B.\n\n          Then, we can assign the labels for the length n-1 accordingly.\n\n        But wait: what if both conditions hold? Then we have two possibilities.\n\n        However, note: the entire string must be fixed. But the problem allows any consistent assignment.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          1. Read n.\n          2. Read the next 2n-2 lines and store them in a list, and also group by length.\n\n          3. For each length from 1 to n-1, we have two strings.\n\n          4. We'll start from the largest length (n-1) and assign the labels.\n\n          How to assign the two strings of length n-1?\n\n            Let the two strings of length n-1 be A and B.\n\n            We have two possibilities for the entire string:\n\n                Option1: s = A + y   and also s = x + B, and we require A+y = x+B.\n\n                Option2: s = A + x   and also s = y + B, and we require A+x = y+B.\n\n            But note: we don't know which one is the prefix and which is the suffix. \n\n            Actually, the two strings of length n-1: one is the prefix (so s[0:n-1]) and the other is the suffix (so s[1:n]). \n\n            Then, the entire string s must be:\n\n                s = (prefix of length n-1) + (last character) \n                and s = (first character) + (suffix of length n-1)\n\n            So the prefix of length n-1 is s[0:n-1] and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1:n].\n\n            Then, the entire string s is the prefix of length n-1 plus the last character (which is the suffix of length1). Also, s is the first character (prefix of length1) plus the suffix of length n-1.\n\n            Therefore, we must have:\n\n                s = prefix_{n-1} + last_char = first_char + suffix_{n-1}\n\n            So the two possibilities are:\n\n                Possibility1: \n                    prefix_{n-1} = A, suffix_{n-1} = B, then s = A + last_char, and also s = first_char + B, so A + last_char = first_char + B.\n\n                Possibility2:\n                    prefix_{n-1} = B, suffix_{n-1} = A, then s = B + last_char = first_char + A.\n\n            But we have two choices for the two length1 strings: (first_char, last_char) = (x,y) or (y,x).\n\n            So we have two equations for Possibility1 and two for Possibility2? Actually, we have two choices for the length1 group and two choices for the assignment of the length n-1 group.\n\n            Actually, we have:\n\n                Possibility1: Assign one of the length n-1 as prefix and the other as suffix, and one of the length1 as first and the other as last.\n\n                There are 2 * 2 = 4 possibilities for the n-1 layer.\n\n            But note: the two strings of length n-1 are fixed, and the two of length1 are fixed.\n\n            We can try:\n\n                candidate1: \n                    prefix_{n-1} = A, suffix_{n-1} = B, and first_char = x, last_char = y -> then we require A+y == x+B.\n\n                candidate2:\n                    prefix_{n-1} = A, suffix_{n-1} = B, and first_char = y, last_char = x -> then we require A+x == y+B.\n\n                candidate3:\n                    prefix_{n-1} = B, suffix_{n-1} = A, and first_char = x, last_char = y -> then we require B+y == x+A.\n\n                candidate4:\n                    prefix_{n-1} = B, suffix_{n-1} = A, and first_char = y, last_char = x -> then we require B+x == y+A.\n\n            Then, if one of these four holds, we can assign the labels for the length n-1 and length1 accordingly.\n\n          However, note: we are not limited to only the n-1 and 1 layers. We must assign all layers.\n\n        This seems complex.\n\n        Let me think simpler: \n\n          We know that the entire string s must be the same regardless of the way we break it.\n\n          Consider: the two strings of length n-1 must be two contiguous substrings of the entire string s, and they are overlapping. Specifically, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0:n-1] and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1:n]. Then the entire string s is:\n\n              s[0]   = first_char (from length1)\n              s[0:n-1] = prefix_{n-1}\n              s[1:n] = suffix_{n-1}\n              s[n-1] = last_char (from length1)\n\n          Then, the condition is: the prefix_{n-1} must start with the first_char, and the suffix_{n-1} must end with the last_char, and also the prefix_{n-1} and suffix_{n-1} must be consistent: the prefix_{n-1} without the first character is the same as the suffix_{n-1} without the last character? Actually, no: \n\n              s[0:n-1] = s[0] + s[1:n-1]\n              s[1:n]   = s[1] + s[2:n]\n\n          There is no direct relation between s[1:n-1] and s[2:n] unless we know more.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n          The entire string s must have the following structure:\n\n            s = (prefix1) + (the rest)   and the rest is the prefix2 (if we consider two consecutive prefixes) but that might not help.\n\n        After reading the problem again, note: \n\n          \"It is guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n.\"\n\n        This means that the two strings of each length are the actual prefixes and suffixes of a string of length n.\n\n        Therefore, we can recover the entire string s by checking the consistency of the two strings of length n-1 with the two strings of length1.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Step 1: Group by length.\n\n          Step 2: Let L1 = set of strings of length1, L_{n-1} = set of strings of length n-1.\n\n          Step 3: For the two strings in L_{n-1}: let A and B.\n\n          Step 4: For the two strings in L1: let x and y.\n\n          Step 5: Check if there exists an assignment of A and B (as prefix and suffix) and x and y (as first and last) such that:\n\n                   A + y == x + B\n\n          If yes, then we can assign the two strings in L_{n-1}: \n                 the one that is A (which is the prefix) gets 'P', and B (the suffix) gets 'S'.\n                 the two strings in L1: the one that is x (the first char) gets 'P', and y (the last char) gets 'S'.\n\n          Then, we can move to the next length (n-2) and so on.\n\n        But what about the other lengths? We must assign all.\n\n        However, note: we are allowed to output any valid assignment.\n\n        How to assign the intermediate lengths?\n\n        We can try to build the entire string s from the above. Once we have the entire string s, then we can assign:\n\n            For each string t of length k, if t is the prefix of length k of s, then output 'P'; else output 'S'.\n\n        But wait, how to build s? We have:\n\n            s = A + y   (if we use candidate1) and also s = x + B.\n\n        Then, once we have s, we can check for every length k from 1 to n-1, whether the prefix of length k is in the given set and the suffix of length k is in the given set.\n\n        But note: the given set is fixed. We know the entire set.\n\n        However, building s is one way.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          1. Read n and the list of strings.\n          2. Group by length: \n               groups = {}\n               for i in range(1, n):\n                   groups[i] = []   # will store two strings of this length\n               for each string in the input:\n                   l = len(string)\n                   if l < n and l>=1:   # since n>=2, and length from 1 to n-1\n                       groups[l].append(string)\n\n          3. For length = n-1 down to 1:\n\n               Let L = length\n               Let arr = groups[L]   # two strings\n\n               We'll consider the two possibilities for the length L: one is prefix, one is suffix.\n\n               But wait, we have two possibilities for the entire string s from the n-1 layer, and then we can use that to determine the entire string.\n\n          However, we have to assign all layers consistently.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n          We know that the entire string s must be the same. Therefore, the two strings of length n-1 must be the prefix and the suffix (without the first and last character respectively). And the entire string s is:\n\n             s = (prefix_{n-1}) + (last_char)   [last_char is the suffix of length1]\n\n          and also\n\n             s = (first_char) + (suffix_{n-1})\n\n          Therefore, we can fix the entire string s by:\n\n             candidate_s = None\n\n             For each assignment of the two length1 strings (two possibilities: (x,y) and (y,x)) and for each assignment of the two length n-1 strings (two possibilities: (A,B) meaning A is prefix and B is suffix, or B is prefix and A is suffix), we can compute the candidate string and check if it is of length n.\n\n             Then, we check if the candidate string s has the following:\n\n                 Its prefixes of length k (for k from 1 to n-1) are in the set of given strings (and the set for each length has exactly two strings, but we don't require the entire set, just that the candidate's prefix and suffix sets are subsets of the given set? Actually, the given set is the union of the prefixes and suffixes, and we know the entire set.\n\n             But note: we have the entire set of 2n-2 strings. The candidate string s must have:\n\n                 { s[0:k] for k in range(1, n) } and { s[n-k:] for k in range(1, n) } must be contained in the given set.\n\n             However, we are guaranteed that the given set is the set of prefixes and suffixes of some string of length n.\n\n          Then, we can iterate over the 4 possibilities for the n-1 and 1 layers and choose the candidate string that satisfies the condition for all lengths.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: It is guaranteed that there is at least one string consistent.\n\n        And n<=100, but the total number of strings is 2n-2 (at most 198) and the lengths are from 1 to n-1 (at most 99). We cannot iterate over 4 possibilities and then for each length from 1 to n-1 check the entire set (because n is up to 100, and the set for each length has two strings, so we need to check for each length k: that the prefix of length k is one of the two and the suffix of length k is the other one).\n\n        However, we have to assign the entire set.\n\n        Steps for the candidate method:\n\n          Step 1: Group by length.\n\n          Step 2: Let groups[length] = list of two strings.\n\n          Step 3: Consider the two possibilities for the two length1 strings: (x,y) and (y,x). And for the two length n-1 strings: (A,B) and (B,A). There are 4 combinations.\n\n          Step 4: For each combination:\n\n                  Let first_char = option1 (either x or y) and last_char = the other.\n                  Let prefix_n_minus_1 = optionA (either A or B) and suffix_n_minus_1 = the other.\n\n                  Then, candidate_string = prefix_n_minus_1 + last_char   [this must be of length n]\n\n                  Also, candidate_string must be equal to first_char + suffix_n_minus_1.\n\n                  Then, we check for every length k from 1 to n-1:\n\n                      prefix_candidate = candidate_string[0:k]\n                      suffix_candidate = candidate_string[n-k:n]\n\n                      Now, check that prefix_candidate is in the group[k] and suffix_candidate is in the group[n-k]? \n\n                  But wait, the group for length k has two strings. And we require that one of them is the prefix_candidate and the other is the suffix_candidate? Actually, no: the entire set of prefixes and suffixes is given, and the candidate_string's prefix of length k must be one of the two in group[k], and similarly for the suffix.\n\n                  However, note: the problem says that the set of given strings is the set of all proper prefixes and suffixes. So for length k, the two strings are the two that appear as the prefix and suffix of the candidate_string.\n\n                  But wait, what if the candidate_string has a prefix of length k that is not in group[k]? Then it's invalid.\n\n                  Similarly, for the suffix.\n\n          Step 5: If a candidate_string satisfies for all k from 1 to n-1: \n                   candidate_string[0:k] is in group[k] and candidate_string[n-k:n] is in group[k] (the same group for length k) ?\n\n                  Actually, for a fixed k, the group[k] has two strings: one is the prefix and one is the suffix. But the candidate_string's prefix of length k is candidate_string[0:k] and its suffix of length k is candidate_string[n-k:n]. We must ensure that these two are the two strings in group[k]. \n\n                  However, note: the two strings in group[k] are the actual prefix and suffix of length k for the true string. In our candidate_string, we are assuming it is the true string, so the prefix and suffix of length k are fixed. Therefore, we require that:\n\n                      { candidate_string[0:k], candidate_string[n-k:n] } == set(group[k])\n\n                  But wait, the group[k] might have two strings, but they might be the same? The problem says the strings are from the given set, and the set is the prefixes and suffixes of the true string. And the true string has distinct prefixes and suffixes? Not necessarily: they can be repeated (like the example n=3, s=\"aaa\": then the prefix of length1 and suffix of length1 are both \"a\", and the prefix of length2 and suffix of length2 are both \"aa\").\n\n          However, the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n.\" \n\n          So if the candidate_string produces a set of prefixes and suffixes that is exactly the given set, then it's valid.\n\n          But note: the given set is fixed. We are not generating the set from the candidate_string; we are comparing.\n\n          Therefore, we require for every k from 1 to n-1:\n\n              candidate_string[0:k] is in group[k]   (which has two strings) and candidate_string[n-k:n] is in group[k]?\n\n          Actually, no: the group[k] is the set of two strings for length k. But the candidate_string's prefix of length k must be one of them, and the suffix of length k must be the other? Not necessarily: the same string can appear as both a prefix and a suffix (like \"aaa\"). \n\n          But wait, the problem says: \"exactly 2 strings of each length from 1 to n-1\", meaning there are two strings (possibly repeated) for each length.\n\n          However, the example n=2: \n                Input: \n                  2\n                  a\n                  c\n\n                Then the two strings of length1 are ['a','c'].\n\n                The candidate_string must be either \"ac\" or \"ca\".\n\n                For candidate_string = \"ac\":\n\n                  Prefix of length1: \"a\" -> must be in group[1] (which is ['a','c']) -> yes.\n                  Suffix of length1: \"c\" -> must be in group[1] -> yes.\n\n                For candidate_string = \"ca\":\n\n                  Prefix of length1: \"c\" -> in group[1] -> yes.\n                  Suffix of length1: \"a\" -> in group[1] -> yes.\n\n          But note: the two strings in group[1] are the two that appear: one is the prefix and one is the suffix. So we don't require that they are distinct.\n\n          Therefore, the condition is: for each k, the two strings in group[k] must include the prefix of candidate_string of length k and the suffix of candidate_string of length k.\n\n          However, what if the candidate_string has the same string for prefix and suffix of length k? Then group[k] must have two occurrences of that string? But the input has two strings, which may be the same.\n\n          Example: n=3, s=\"aaa\", then the set is:\n\n            length1: ['a','a']\n            length2: ['aa','aa']\n\n          Then, the candidate_string \"aaa\" must have:\n\n            k=1: prefix \"a\", suffix \"a\" -> both are in group[1] (which is ['a','a'])\n            k=2: prefix \"aa\", suffix \"aa\" -> both are in group[2] (which is ['aa','aa'])\n\n          So the condition is: for each k, the multiset { candidate_string[0:k], candidate_string[n-k:n] } must be equal to the multiset group[k] (if we consider duplicates) OR if we don't care about order, then the two elements (with duplicates) must match.\n\n          But note: the input gives two strings for each length. We are grouping by length, so group[k] is a list of two strings (which might be duplicates). \n\n         ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input consists of `2n-2` strings, with exactly two strings for each length from 1 to `n-1`. The solution involves verifying the consistency of these strings by checking if they can form a valid string `s` when appropriately assigned as prefixes or suffixes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to assign each given string as either a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S') such that there exists at least one string `s` of length `n` whose prefixes and suffixes match the given strings. The key insight is that the entire string `s` must be consistent across all its prefixes and suffixes of lengths 1 to `n-1`.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The solution leverages the fact that the longest possible prefixes and suffixes (of length `n-1`) must align with the first and last characters of `s`. Specifically, the prefix of length `n-1` should end with the last character of `s`, and the suffix of length `n-1` should start with the first character of `s`. This relationship helps in validating potential candidates for `s`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - **Grouping Strings by Length**: Organize the input strings into groups based on their lengths.\n   - **Candidate Validation**: For each possible combination of the two longest strings (length `n-1`) and the two shortest strings (length 1), construct a candidate string `s` and verify if all its prefixes and suffixes match the given strings.\n   - **Output Assignment**: Once a valid candidate is found, assign 'P' to the strings that form the prefixes of `s` and 'S' to those that form the suffixes.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks up to 4 combinations (due to two possibilities for assigning the longest and shortest strings). For each combination, it verifies all lengths from 1 to `n-1`, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2), which is efficient given the constraint `n ≤ 100`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    total_strings = 2 * n - 2\n    strings = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + total_strings):\n        strings.append(data[i].strip())\n    \n    groups = {}\n    for length in range(1, n):\n        groups[length] = []\n    \n    for s in strings:\n        l = len(s)\n        if l < n and l >= 1:\n            groups[l].append(s)\n    \n    keys = sorted(groups.keys(), reverse=True)\n    res = [''] * (2 * n - 2)\n    found = False\n\n    for k in keys:\n        arr = groups[k]\n        if len(arr) != 2:\n            continue\n        \n        if k == n-1:\n            A, B = arr\n            len1_arr = groups[1]\n            if len(len1_arr) != 2:\n                continue\n            x, y = len1_arr\n            \n            candidates = [\n                (A, B, x, y),\n                (A, B, y, x),\n                (B, A, x, y),\n                (B, A, y, x)\n            ]\n            \n            for cand in candidates:\n                prefix_n_minus_1, suffix_n_minus_1, first_char, last_char = cand\n                cand_str = prefix_n_minus_1 + last_char\n                if len(cand_str) != n:\n                    continue\n                    \n                if cand_str != first_char + suffix_n_minus_1:\n                    continue\n                    \n                valid = True\n                for L in range(1, n):\n                    if L not in groups:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                    arrL = groups[L]\n                    prefix_L = cand_str[:L]\n                    suffix_L = cand_str[n-L:]\n                    if prefix_L not in arrL and suffix_L not in arrL:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                    if set([prefix_L, suffix_L]) != set(arrL):\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                \n                if valid:\n                    found = True\n                    for L in range(1, n):\n                        arrL = groups[L]\n                        for s_str in arrL:\n                            if s_str == prefix_n_minus_1:\n                                idx1 = strings.index(prefix_n_minus_1)\n                                idx2 = strings.index(suffix_n_minus_1)\n                                res[idx1] = 'P'\n                                res[idx2] = 'S'\n                            elif s_str == suffix_n_minus_1:\n                                idx = strings.index(s_str)\n                                res[idx] = 'S'\n                    break\n            \n            if found:\n                break\n        \n        else:\n            arr = groups[k]\n            P1, P2 = arr\n            if found:\n                if P1 in (prefix_n_minus_1, suffix_n_minus_1):\n                    idx1 = strings.index(P1)\n                    idx2 = strings.index(P2)\n                    if P1 == prefix_n_minus_1:\n                        res[idx1] = 'P'\n                        res[idx2] = 'S'\n                    else:\n                        res[idx1] = 'S'\n                        res[idx2] = 'P'\n                else:\n                    idx1 = strings.index(P1)\n                    idx2 = strings.index(P2)\n                    res[idx1] = 'S'\n                    res[idx2] = 'P'\n            else:\n                pass\n    \n    if found:\n        output_str = ''.join(res)\n        print(output_str)\n    else:\n        print(\"\".join(['P' if i % 2 == 0 else 'S' for i in range(2 * n - 2)]))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line is the length `n` of the string `s`, followed by `2n-2` strings.\n2. **Grouping Strings**: Strings are grouped by their lengths into a dictionary where keys are lengths and values are lists of strings of that length.\n3. **Candidate Validation**: The algorithm checks all combinations of the two longest strings (length `n-1`) and the two shortest strings (length 1) to form a candidate string `s`. For each candidate, it verifies if all prefixes and suffixes of `s` match the given strings.\n4. **Assignment of Labels**: Once a valid candidate is found, the algorithm assigns 'P' to strings forming prefixes of `s` and 'S' to those forming suffixes. If no candidate is found (though the problem guarantees one), a fallback assignment is used.\n5. **Output**: The result is a string of 'P's and 'S's indicating the assignment of each input string.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible candidates for `s` by leveraging the constraints provided, ensuring correctness while maintaining optimal performance.",
