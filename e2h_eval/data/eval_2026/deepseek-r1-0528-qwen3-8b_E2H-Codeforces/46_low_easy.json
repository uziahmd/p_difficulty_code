The value (j - i + 1) denotes the length of the subsegment.Your task is to find the longest subsegment of a, such that it is possible to change at most one number (change one number to any integer you want) from the subsegment to make the subsegment strictly increasing.You only need to output the length of the subsegment you find.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).\n\n## Output\nIn a single line print the answer to the problem — the maximum length of the required subsegment.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6\\n7 2 3 1 5 6']\n\n### Output\n['5']\n\n## Note\nYou can choose subsegment a2, a3, a4, a5, a6 and change its 3rd element (that is a4) to 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are allowed to change at most one number. The goal is to find the longest subsegment that can be made strictly increasing by changing at most one element.\n\n Observation:\n 1. Without any change, we can have a contiguous strictly increasing segment. But we are allowed to fix one broken part.\n\n Steps:\n - We can precompute:\n   * `left[i]`: the length of the strictly increasing sequence ending exactly at index i (with a[i] being the last element).\n   * `right[i]`: the length of the strictly increasing sequence starting exactly at index i (with a[i] being the first element).\n\n How to compute `left`:\n   left[0] = 1\n   for i from 1 to n-1:\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            left[i] = left[i-1] + 1\n        else:\n            left[i] = 1\n\n Similarly, `right`:\n   right[n-1] = 1\n   for i from n-2 down to 0:\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right[i] = right[i+1] + 1\n        else:\n            right[i] = 1\n\n However, note: we are allowed to change one number. So we can consider:\n\n Option 1: The entire segment might be fixed by changing one element in the middle. Then the total length would be `left[i] + right[i+1]` but only if we can fix the break between i and i+1.\n\n Conditions for a break between i and i+1:\n   - We require that the two parts (the increasing sequence ending at i and the increasing sequence starting at i+1) can be merged by modifying either a[i] or a[i+1].\n\n Actually, we can consider two possibilities for the break at position i (between i and i+1):\n\n Case 1: We change a[i] to a value that is less than a[i+1] and greater than (if exists) a[i-1]. But note we are allowed to change only one element and we are considering merging two increasing sequences.\n\n Alternatively, we can think:\n\n Let the candidate subsegment be [l, r] (0-indexed). We consider:\n\n   Without any change: then the segment must be strictly increasing.\n\n   With one change: we can break the segment into two parts and fix the middle.\n\n Another idea:\n\n   We can try to form a candidate by:\n\n   Candidate 1: The entire array might be fixed by one change? But note: we are looking for contiguous subsegment.\n\n   We can consider:\n\n   Let the candidate be built by:\n\n      Option A: If there is no break, then the entire segment is strictly increasing -> candidate = length.\n\n      Option B: There is exactly one break (so two adjacent elements that are not strictly increasing). Then we can fix by changing one of them.\n\n   But note: the break might not be just one inversion? Actually, the problem allows changing one number arbitrarily. So we can fix one element that might be causing multiple breaks? However, note that the entire segment must be strictly increasing. \n\n   Example: [1, 3, 2, 4] \n        Here, if we change the 2 to 3, then we get [1,3,3,4] which is not strictly increasing. So we must change the 3 (at index1) to something less than 2? Or change the 2 to something more than 3? Actually, we can change the 3 (index1) to 2.5? But wait, the numbers are integers and we can choose any integer. So we can set a[1]=2, then the segment becomes [1,2,2,4] -> still not strictly increasing. Alternatively, set a[1]=0, then [1,0,2,4] -> now the first two are decreasing. \n\n   Actually, we can only fix one element. The condition for the entire segment to be strictly increasing is that after the change, each adjacent pair must satisfy a[i] < a[i+1]. \n\n   Alternate approach:\n\n   We can consider:\n\n     Let's say we are going to consider a subsegment that has at most one \"break\" (i.e., one pair (i, i+1) such that a[i] >= a[i+1]) and then we fix that break by changing either a[i] or a[i+1]. However, note that the break might be fixed by changing an element that is not necessarily one of the two in the break? Actually, we are allowed to change only one element anywhere in the subsegment.\n\n   But note: if we change an element that is not at the break, it might create a new break. Therefore, the common idea is to consider:\n\n     We can consider three types of segments:\n\n        Type 1: Entirely increasing",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the longest contiguous subsegment of an array where, by changing at most one element, the subsegment can be made strictly increasing. The solution involves efficiently determining the maximum length of such a subsegment by leveraging precomputed arrays that track increasing sequences from both ends.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Arrays**: \n   - `left[i]` stores the length of the strictly increasing sequence ending at index `i`.\n   - `right[i]` stores the length of the strictly increasing sequence starting at index `i`.\n\n2. **Check for Valid Segments**:\n   - For each index `i`, consider the segment that could potentially include the break between `i-1` and `i`. This involves checking if the left part (up to `i-1`) and the right part (from `i+1` onwards) can be merged by modifying either `a[i-1]` or `a[i]`.\n   - Specifically, if the left part's last element is less than the right part's first element, then the combined length of these parts plus one (if modifying `a[i]` or `a[i-1]`) forms a valid strictly increasing segment.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Handle cases where the entire array is already strictly increasing.\n   - Consider segments of length 1 or 2, which trivially satisfy the condition with or without modification.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    left = [1] * n\n    right = [1] * n\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            left[i] = left[i-1] + 1\n            \n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right[i] = right[i+1] + 1\n            \n    best = 1\n    for i in range(n):\n        if left[i] == 1 and right[i] == 1:\n            continue\n            \n        total_length = 0\n        if left[i] > 1 and i < n-1 and right[i+1] > 1:\n            if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                total_length = left[i] + right[i+1]\n                if total_length > best:\n                    best = total_length\n                    \n        if left[i] > 1 and i < n-1 and right[i+1] > 1:\n            if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                total_length = left[i] + right[i+1]\n                if total_length > best:\n                    best = total_length\n                    \n        if left[i] == 1 and i > 0 and right[i-1] > 1:\n            if a[i-2] < a[i]:\n                total_length = right[i-1] + 1 + (left[i] if i < n-1 else 0)\n                if total_length > best:\n                    best = total_length\n                    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if left[i] > 1 or right[i] > 1:\n            if left[i] + right[i] - 1 > best:\n                best = left[i] + right[i] - 1\n                \n    if best == 0:\n        best = 1\n        \n    print(best)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Arrays**: The `left` array is filled by iterating from the start to the end of the array, incrementing the count if the current element is greater than the previous one. Similarly, the `right` array is filled by iterating from the end to the start, incrementing the count if the current element is less than the next one.\n2. **Check Valid Segments**: For each element, the code checks if merging the left and right increasing sequences around it (by potentially modifying the current element) results in a longer strictly increasing segment. This is done by verifying if the left part's last element is less than the right part's first element.\n3. **Edge Handling**: Special cases such as single-element segments or segments where the entire array is already strictly increasing are handled separately to ensure correctness.\n4. **Output**: The maximum length found during the checks is printed as the result, which represents the longest subsegment that can be made strictly increasing by changing at most one element.",
