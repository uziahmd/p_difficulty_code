After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read the first line to get n and m.\n Then, we read the next n lines, each containing a string of m digits.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We need to know for each subject, what is the maximum mark? Because the best at a subject is the one who has the maximum mark (and note: if there are multiple with the same maximum, then they are all best in that subject).\n\n 2. However, the problem says: \n    - A student is successful if there exists at least one subject for which he is the best.\n\n 3. But note: if a subject has multiple students with the same highest mark, then all those students are considered best in that subject.\n\n 4. So, for each subject j, we can compute:\n        max_mark[j] = maximum digit (converted to integer) in column j.\n\n 5. Then, for each student i (row i), we check for at least one subject j (column j) such that:\n        grade[i][j] == max_mark[j]   (i.e., the mark in that subject is the maximum for that subject)\n\n 6. However, note: it's possible that a student might have the maximum mark in several subjects, but we only need one.\n\n Implementation:\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Example Input 1:\n     3 3\n     223\n     232\n     112\n\n Steps:\n\n  Read n=3, m=3.\n\n  The grid is:\n      ['223', '232', '112']\n\n  Transpose the grid to get columns? Or process by columns.\n\n  For each column j (from 0 to m-1):\n      Column0: ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2' (but we can compare as characters or convert to int? Actually, comparing as characters is okay because '1'<'2' etc. but note: the marks are from 1 to 9, so they are single-digit numbers and the character representation is the same as integer comparison for these. But let's be cautious: we can convert to int if needed, but actually for max we can use the char since '1' < '2' ... but wait: the input is given as strings of digits.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      max_marks = [0]*m\n      for j in range(m):\n          col_vals = [int(row[j]) for row in grid]\n          max_marks[j] = max(col_vals)\n\n  Then, for each student i (each row in grid):\n      for j in range(m):\n          if int(grid[i][j]) == max_marks[j]:\n              then this student is successful at least in subject j -> mark him as successful and break the inner loop.\n\n  But note: we are counting the number of successful students.\n\n  However, we must be cautious: if we break the inner loop for a student, we don't check other subjects. That's okay because we only need one.\n\n  But wait: what if a student has multiple best subjects? We still count him once.\n\n  So:\n\n      successful = 0\n      For each student i:\n          found = False\n          for j in range(m):\n              if grid[i][j] == str(max_marks[j]):   # But wait, our max_marks[j] is an integer. Alternatively, we can store the max_marks as string or keep the grid as string and compare with the string representation of the max.\n\n          However, we can avoid converting the grid[i][j] to int if we already stored the max_marks as the same type. Since we computed max_marks from integers, we can compare the integer value to the integer conversion of grid[i][j]. But note: the grid is given as a string of digits, so we can either convert the grid[i][j] to int or we could have kept the max_marks as string.\n\n  Let me change: we can compute max_marks as integers, then for each cell, convert to int and compare.\n\n  However, the problem says the input is without spaces. We can also do:\n\n      max_marks = [max(int(x) for x in row[j] for row in grid)]   but wait, we have to iterate over rows for each column.\n\n  Alternatively, we can precompute the grid as integers?\n\n  Since n, m <= 100, we can do:\n\n      grid_int = []\n      for i in range(n):\n          row = list(map(int, list(input_str[i])))\n          grid_int.append(row)\n\n  But the input is given as a string without spaces. We are reading from stdin.\n\n  Actually, the example input is given as a string in the example, but in reality we read from stdin.\n\n  How to read?\n\n      data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n      first_line = data[0].split()\n      n = int(first_line[0]); m",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves processing a grid of marks where each row represents a student and each column represents a subject. For each subject, we need to find the highest mark achieved by any student. A student is successful if they have the highest mark in at least one subject.\n2. **Intuition**: For each subject (column), identify the maximum mark. Then, for each student (row), check if they have the maximum mark in any subject. If they do, they are counted as successful.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Read the input values and parse the grid of marks.\n   - For each subject (column), compute the maximum mark across all students.\n   - For each student, check if they have the maximum mark in any subject. If they do, increment their success count.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves iterating over each element in the grid twice: once to compute column maxima and once to check student success. The time complexity is O(n*m), which is efficient given the constraints (n, m ≤ 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    n = int(first_line[0])\n    m = int(first_line[1])\n    \n    grid = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        grid.append(data[i])\n        \n    max_marks = [0] * m\n    for j in range(m):\n        col_vals = [int(row[j]) for row in grid]\n        max_marks[j] = max(col_vals)\n        \n    count_successful = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        found = False\n        for j in range(m):\n            if int(grid[i][j]) == max_marks[j]:\n                found = True\n                break\n        if found:\n            count_successful += 1\n            \n    print(count_successful)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line contains the number of students (n) and subjects (m). Subsequent lines contain the marks for each student.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), the maximum mark is determined by examining all student marks in that subject.\n3. **Checking Student Success**: Each student is checked against the maximum marks of all subjects. If a student has the maximum mark in any subject, they are counted as successful.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects to determine their success status, leveraging simple loops and comparisons to achieve the desired result.",
