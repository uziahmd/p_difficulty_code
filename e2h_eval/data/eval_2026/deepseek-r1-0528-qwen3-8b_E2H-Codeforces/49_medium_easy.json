They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a graph with n nodes and m edges. For each edge (u, v), we are given two numbers: gcd and lcm.\n We know that for two numbers a and b (the mushrooms on the two lawns), we have:\n   gcd(a, b) = g, lcm(a, b) = l.\n And the relationship: a * b = g^2 * (l // g)   [Wait, actually: a*b = gcd * lcm? But note: \n   Actually, we know that for two numbers: a * b = gcd(a,b) * lcm(a,b). So, a * b = g * l.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require unique restoration, so we can choose any one.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check the consistency of the input: for each edge, we must have that the gcd divides the lcm (otherwise, it's invalid).\n    Also, note that from g and l, we can recover the two numbers a and b only up to their prime factorizations.\n\n 2. We can use the following: \n    Let a = g * x, b = g * y, then since lcm(a,b)=g*x*y (if x and y are coprime) then we must have x*y = l//g.\n    Therefore, we can set the two numbers as g * d1 and g * d2, where d1*d2 = l//g and gcd(d1,d2)=1.\n\n    But note: the problem does not require the numbers to be integers? Actually, the problem states that the numbers are at least 1 and at most 10^6, and they are positive integers.\n\n 3. However, we don't know which pair (d1, d2) to assign. Moreover, we have a whole graph. The idea is to assign to each node a value (the mushroom count) and check consistency over edges.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n   We know that for an edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm l, the two numbers at u and v must satisfy:\n        a_u * a_v = g * l\n        gcd(a_u, a_v) = g\n\n   We can factorize g and l//g? But note: the constraints say that g, l up to 10^6, and we have up to 10^6 nodes? Actually, n and m are not specified but typically in competitive programming problems, we assume n and m can be up to 10^5 or 10^6.\n\n   However, note that the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 10^6.\"\n\n   But we have multiple edges. We can try to set up equations for the entire graph.\n\n Observation:\n\n   Since the entire graph must have consistent assignments, we can consider:\n\n   Let the number at node i be x_i.\n\n   For an edge (u, v): \n        x_u * x_v = g * l, and \n        gcd(x_u, x_v) = g.\n\n   We can write x_u = g * a, x_v = g * b, then a and b must be coprime and a * b = (g * l) / (g*g) = l / g.\n\n   But note: the equation x_u * x_v = g * l must hold, and also the gcd condition. However, note that if we set x_u = g * a and x_v = g * b, then the gcd(x_u, x_v) = g * gcd(a, b). We require this to be g, so gcd(a, b)=1.\n\n   Then, we can set for each edge the product of the two numbers (without the gcd part) must be (l//g). But wait: we have to account for the entire graph.\n\n   How to assign?\n\n   Another idea: factorize all the given gcds and lcms? But that might be too heavy.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n   For each edge, we know that the two numbers must be divisors of the product (g * l) and their gcd is g. However, we don't know the factors.\n\n   We can use the concept of prime factorization, but note that the numbers can be as large as 10^6 and we have up to 10^6 edges? Actually, m can be up to 10^6, but n is the number of nodes.\n\n   However, note that the problem does not specify the bounds for n and m, but we should design for worst-case.\n\n   Alternate Insight:\n\n   Consider that the entire graph must have the same assignment for every node. We can try to set up a system of equations by considering the prime factors.\n\n   But note: we are allowed to output any arrangement. So we can try to assign a base value to one node and then propagate.\n\n   However, there is a known fact: the value at each node must be divisible by the gcd of the edges incident to it? Actually, let me think.\n\n   Let d_i be the value at node i. Then for an edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm l, we have:\n        d_u * d_v = g * l, and \n        gcd(d_u, d_v) = g.\n\n   We can also note that g must divide both d_u and d_v. Therefore, the value at each node must be divisible by the gcd of all the edges incident to it? Not exactly: because the gcd condition is for each edge individually. However, if we look at the entire graph, we can set the value at a node as the product of primes raised to some exponents.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. For each edge, check that g divides l (so that l % g == 0). If not, return \"NO\".\n\n   2. Then, we can set the value for each node as the product of the gcds of the edges incident to it? Not directly.\n\n   Another idea: \n\n        Let M be the LCM of all the edges? Not necessarily.\n\n   However, note: the entire graph must satisfy the edge conditions. We can try to assign a variable for each node and use the equations.\n\n   But note: we have two equations per edge (one multiplicative and one gcd). This is complex.\n\n   Known simpler approach:\n\n        For an edge (u, v): \n            d_u * d_v = g * l   ... (1)\n            gcd(d_u, d_v) = g   ... (2)\n\n        From (2), we can write d_u = g * a, d_v = g * b, and then gcd(a, b) = 1, and a * b = (g*l) / (g*g) = l/g.\n\n        Now, note that the entire graph must have the same assignment for each node. However, the same node may appear in multiple edges.\n\n        We can assign for each node a value that is the product of the gcds of the edges incident to it? Not exactly.\n\n   Let me consider the following:\n\n        For each node, we can define a candidate value. Notice that the value at a node must be divisible by all the gcds of the edges incident to it.\n\n        But wait: consider two edges from node u: (u, v) with gcd g1 and (u, w) with gcd g2. Then d_u must be divisible by g1 and by g2. However, that is necessary but not sufficient.\n\n   Another idea: use the fact that the value at node u must be divisible by the gcd of the two numbers in an edge, but also the product condition.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not require the entire graph to be connected. But the input says \"no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road\", but the graph may be disconnected.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. For each edge, check that g divides l (i.e., l % g == 0). If not, print \"NO\" and exit.\n\n   2. Then, we can consider the graph and try to assign values.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        Let x_i be the value for node i.\n\n        For edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm l, we have:\n            x_u * x_v = g * l.\n\n        Also, note that x_u and x_v must be multiples of g.\n\n        We can set: \n            x_u = g * a, x_v = g * b, and then a * b = l // g, and gcd(a, b)=1.\n\n        Now, what if we try to assign the entire graph?\n\n        We can use the following: assign to each node a value that is the product of the gcds of the edges incident to it? Not exactly, because the gcds of edges might not be independent.\n\n   However, note: we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem? Or factorize the entire graph by primes.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following known fact:\n\n        In such a graph, the value at each node must be divisible by the gcd of the entire graph? Or by the gcd of the edges incident to it.\n\n        But note: the value at node u must be divisible by the gcd of the edges incident to u, but also the product condition with neighbors.\n\n   Let me try to assign:\n\n        Step 1: For each edge, we know that the two numbers must be divisors of the product g*l, and they must be multiples of g.\n\n        Step 2: We can set up an initial assignment: for each node, let base[u] = 1, then for each edge, we have two numbers (g*a and g*b) and we can try to assign the base value for the node as the product of the gcds of the edges incident to it? Not sure.\n\n   Another idea: use the fact that the product of all the edges' g*l must be consistent with the square of the product of the node values? \n\n        Let P = product_{all nodes} x_i.\n        Then, for each edge (u, v): x_u * x_v = g * l.\n\n        Then, if we take the product of all edges' equations, we get:\n            (product_{edges} (g*l)) = (product_{edges} (x_u * x_v))\n\n        Note that each node appears as many times as its degree. So:\n            product_{edges} (g*l) = (product_{nodes} x_i)^(number_of_edges)   ??? \n\n        Actually, no: the product over edges of (x_u * x_v) is the product of x_i raised to the degree of i? But wait, each edge is counted twice (once for u and once for v) if we break it down? Actually, no: the product over edges (each edge gives x_u * x_v) is the product of all x_i raised to the number of edges incident to i (which is the degree). \n\n        However, note: the same node appears in multiple edges. So:\n\n            ∏_{edges} (x_u * x_v) = ∏_{nodes} (x_i)^(degree(i))\n\n        Then, we have:\n            ∏_{edges} (g*l) = ∏_{nodes} (x_i)^(degree(i))\n\n        But we don't know the x_i. \n\n   This seems too abstract.\n\n   Let's try a different approach:\n\n        We know for each edge (u, v): \n            x_u * x_v = g * l, and \n            x_u and x_v must be multiples of g.\n\n        We can set the value for node u as the product of the gcds from all edges incident to u? No, that doesn't work.\n\n   After reading some known similar problems (like CodeForces problems), I recall that one way is to set the value for each node as the product of the gcds of the edges incident to it, but then adjust by the lcm conditions? \n\n   But wait, here is a known solution for a similar problem (CodeForces 878I, for example) but that is about trees and the problem is harder.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        For each edge, we have two conditions. We can use the following:\n\n        Let d[u] be the value at node u.\n\n        For an edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm l, we have:\n            d[u] * d[v] = g * l   (condition 1)\n            d[u] must be divisible by g, and d[v] must be divisible by g. (condition 2)\n\n        Additionally, the gcd condition: gcd(d[u], d[v]) = g.\n\n        Condition 1 and condition 2 together imply condition 3? Not necessarily: because even if d[u] and d[v] are multiples of g and their product is g*l, the gcd might be larger than g.\n\n        Example: g=2, l=4 -> then d[u]*d[v]=8. Suppose d[u]=4, d[v]=2 -> gcd(4,2)=2 -> works. But if d[u]=8, d[v]=1 -> then 8*1=8, but gcd(8,1)=1 !=2 -> fails.\n\n        So condition 1 and condition 2 are necessary but not sufficient.\n\n        How to enforce condition 3? \n\n        We can set d[u] = g * a, d[v] = g * b, then a and b must be coprime and a*b = l//g.\n\n        Then, the problem reduces to: assign to each edge two coprime numbers (a, b) such that the product is l//g, and then the entire graph must have consistent assignments for the nodes.\n\n        Now, note that the same node u appears in multiple edges. In each edge, the node u is assigned a factor a (relative to the edge's gcd). But the factor a must be the same across edges? Not exactly, because the gcd base (g) is different for each edge.\n\n        Wait, the base g is different for each edge. So the same node u must have a value d[u] that is divisible by the gcd of the edge's gcds? Not necessarily.\n\n        Actually, the value d[u] must be divisible by each edge's gcd (because each edge condition requires d[u] divisible by g). So d[u] must be divisible by the least common multiple of all the g's from edges incident to u? Not exactly: the condition is per edge. But note, if an edge has gcd g, then d[u] must be divisible by g. So d[u] must be divisible by the gcd of all the g's from the edges incident to u? Actually, no: it must be divisible by each g, so by the least common multiple of those g's.\n\n        However, we don't know d[u] yet.\n\n   Let me reframe:\n\n        We have a graph and for each edge (u, v) we have two numbers: g and l, and we know that d[u] and d[v] must satisfy:\n            d[u] * d[v] = g * l, and\n            d[u] is divisible by g, d[v] is divisible by g, and gcd(d[u], d[v]) = g.\n\n        We can set d[u] = g * a, d[v] = g * b, then a and b must be coprime and a*b = l//g.\n\n        Now, if we factorize l//g, then a and b must be two coprime divisors of l//g whose product is l//g.\n\n        Then, for node u, in the edge (u, v) we have d[u] = g * a, and in the edge (u, w) we have d[u] = h * c (for edge (u, w) with gcd h and lcm ...).\n\n        Therefore, d[u] must be equal to g * a and h * c, so we require that g * a = h * c.\n\n        This suggests that we can set d[u] to be the product of the gcds of the edges incident to u multiplied by the corresponding factors (but the factors must be chosen consistently).\n\n   This seems complicated.\n\n   Another known approach: \n\n        We can set the value for each node as the product of the gcds of the edges incident to it? \n\n        But wait, consider: \n          For an edge (u, v): we have d[u] * d[v] = g * l.\n\n        If we set d[u] = (product of gcds of edges incident to u) and similarly for d[v], then the product would be (product_{edges incident to u} g) * (product_{edges incident to v} g) = (g1 * g2 * ... * gk) * (g1' * g2' * ...) which is not necessarily g*l.\n\n   Alternatively, we can set the value for each node as the product of the gcds of the edges incident to it, divided by the gcds of the edges from the other nodes? Not clear.\n\n   Insight from the problem: \n\n        There is an alternative representation: the entire graph must be such that the value at each node is the product of the gcds of the edges incident to it, but then the lcm condition must hold.\n\n   After thinking, a better idea is to use the following:\n\n        Since for each edge (u, v): \n            d[u] * d[v] = g * l, and d[u] and d[v] are multiples of g.\n\n        We can set d[u] = g * (some factor) for each edge. But the factor must be consistent.\n\n        However, note that the entire graph must have the same d[u] for node u.\n\n        Let me define:\n\n            For each node u, let S(u) be the set of edges incident to u.\n\n            Then, d[u] must be divisible by g for every edge (u, v) with gcd g.\n\n        Then, let G(u) = the least common multiple of all the g's for edges incident to u.\n\n        Then, d[u] must be divisible by G(u).\n\n        Now, for an edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm l, we have:\n\n            d[u] * d[v] = g * l.\n\n        And d[u] is divisible by G(u) and d[v] by G(v). But note that g must divide both d[u] and d[v]. \n\n        But G(u) is the lcm of the g's from edges incident to u, so g divides G(u) (since g is one of them). Therefore, G(u) divides d[u]? Not necessarily: we only said d[u] must be divisible by each g, so d[u] must be divisible by the lcm of the g's (which is G(u)).\n\n        So we set d[u] = k * G(u) for some integer k. Then, the equation for an edge (u, v) becomes:\n\n            k * G(u) * k * G(v) = g * l   =>   k^2 * (G(u) * G(v)) = g * l.\n\n        Then, we must have that g * l is divisible by G(u)*G(v). Moreover, (g * l) / (G(u)*G(v)) must be a perfect square.\n\n        Then, we can set k = sqrt( (g * l) / (G(u)*G(v)) ) and then check if it is an integer.\n\n        But note: G(u) is defined as the lcm of the g's of edges incident to u, and G(v) for the edge (u, v) is the lcm of the g's of edges incident to v (including this edge).\n\n        However, we don't know G(u) until we know all edges incident to u. But we are building the graph.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          1. Build the graph: n nodes, m edges. For each edge, store (g, l) and the two endpoints.\n\n          2. Precompute for each node the list of edges (and the gcds) incident to it.\n\n          3. For each node, compute G(u) = lcm{ g for each edge incident to u }.\n\n          4. Then, for each edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm l, we check:\n                - g divides l (already done above)\n                - Let T = (g * l) / (G(u) * G(v))\n                - Then, T must be a perfect square, and then set k = sqrt(T). Then, we assign d[u] = k * G(u) and d[v] = k * G(v).\n\n          5. But note: the same node u is used in multiple edges, so we must have the same k for all edges? Actually, for node u, the value d[u] is fixed: d[u] = k_u * G(u). Then, for an edge (u, v) we have:\n\n                d[u] * d[v] = (k_u * G(u)) * (k_v * G(v)) = g * l.\n\n                But k_u and k_v are fixed for each node.\n\n          However, we cannot set k_u independently for each edge. \n\n        Alternatively, we can set:\n\n            For each node u, d[u] = k * G(u), where k is a global constant? But then:\n\n                d[u] * d[v] = k^2 * G(u)*G(v) = g * l.\n\n            Then, for every edge (u, v) we must have the same k^2 = (g * l) / (G(u)*G(v)). \n\n            Therefore, for the entire graph, (g * l) / (G(u)*G(v)) must be the same for every edge (u, v). \n\n        But wait, what if the graph is disconnected? Then we have multiple connected components. Then, we can set different k for each component.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not say the graph is connected.\n\n        Steps for connected component:\n\n          For each connected component, we can do:\n\n            Step 1: Compute G(u) for each node u in the component (from the edges in the component? Actually, we consider only the edges in the graph, and the graph is given, but the component uses the edges within the component).\n\n            Step 2: For each edge (u, v) in the component, compute T = (g * l) / (G(u) * G(v)). This must be the same for every edge (otherwise, the answer is NO).\n\n            Step 3: Then, set k^2 = T, so k = sqrt(T). Then, assign d[u] = k * G(u) for each node u in the component.\n\n            Step 4: Check that for each edge (u, v) in the component: \n                    d[u] * d[v] == g * l   (should hold by construction) \n                    and gcd(d[u], d[v]) == g.\n\n            But note: we have set d[u] = k * G(u) and d[v] = k * G(v). Then, \n                    gcd(d[u], d[v]) = k * gcd(G(u), G(v))\n\n            We require that gcd(d[u], d[v]) = g.\n\n            But note: G(u) is the lcm of the g's of edges incident to u. In particular, the edge (u, v) has gcd g, so g divides G(u) and g divides G(v). Therefore, gcd(G(u), G(v)) is at least g. \n\n            However, we require: k * gcd(G(u), G(v)) = g.\n\n            But k = sqrt((g * l) / (G(u)*G(v))) and note that l = (g * l) / (g) = ...? \n\n            Alternatively, from the definition of G(u) and G(v):\n\n                G(u) = lcm_{e incident to u} (g_e)\n\n                Similarly for G(v).\n\n            And note that the edge (u, v) has gcd g, so g is one of the g's in the list for u and for v.\n\n            Also, note that the product d[u]*d[v] = k^2 * G(u)*G(v) = g * l.\n\n            We have two conditions:\n\n                Condition 1: k^2 * G(u)*G(v) = g * l.\n                Condition 2: gcd(d[u], d[v]) = k * gcd(G(u), G(v)) = g.\n\n            So, we require:\n\n                k * gcd(G(u), G(v)) = g   =>   gcd(G(u), G(v)) = g / k.\n\n            But k is an integer (because T must be a perfect square) and g/k must be an integer.\n\n            Also, note that k^2 * G(u)*G(v) = g * l, and we know that l = (g * l) / (g) = ...? Actually, we can express l in terms of the gcds? Not directly.\n\n        This method might be too restrictive.\n\n   Let me test with the example:\n\n        Example 1: Input \"2 1\\n1 2 1 3\"\n\n        n=2, m=1, edge (1,2) with g=1, l=3.\n\n        Then, for node1 and node2, the only edge is (1,2) so:\n\n            G(1) = lcm{1} = 1\n            G(2) = lcm{1} = 1\n\n            Then, T = (1*3) / (1*1) = 3, which is not a perfect square -> fails.\n\n        But the example output is \"YES\\n1 3\"\n\n        Why? \n\n        We could assign d[1]=1, d[2]=3.\n\n        Then, for the edge: \n            d[1]*d[2] = 1*3 = 3 = g*l = 1*3 -> holds.\n            gcd(1,3)=1 = g -> holds.\n\n        What went wrong in our method?\n\n        We assumed that the value for node1 must be k * G(1) and for node2 k * G(2). But k would be sqrt( (g*l)/(G(1)*G(2)) ) = sqrt(3) -> not an integer.\n\n        So our method failed because we assumed that the value is k * G(u) for a fixed k. But note: the value at node u is not necessarily the product of the gcds (in the sense of lcm) of the edges. \n\n        Actually, the condition that d[u] must be divisible by the gcd of each incident edge is necessary, but we cannot force d[u] to be the lcm of the gcds (which is G(u)) multiplied by a fixed k for the entire component.\n\n   Revised idea:\n\n        We know that for an edge (u, v): d[u] * d[v] = g * l, and d[u] and d[v] must be multiples of g.\n\n        We can set d[u] and d[v] as follows:\n\n            Let d[u] = g * a, d[v] = (g * l) / (g * a) = l / a.\n\n            Then, the gcd condition: gcd(g*a, l/a) = g.\n\n            This implies that gcd(a, l/(g*a)) = 1.\n\n            But note: l = g * (something) ? Actually, from the edge condition, we have that g divides l, so l = g * m, then d[u] * d[v] = g * (g*m) = g^2 * m, and then d[u] = g * a, d[v] = g * (m / a). Then, gcd(g*a, g*(m/a)) = g * gcd(a, m/a) = g, so we require gcd(a, m/a)=1.\n\n            Therefore, a must be a divisor of m (where m = l//g) and gcd(a, m//a)=1.\n\n        Now, for node u, we have to choose an a for each incident edge. But the same node u must have the same d[u] for all edges.\n\n        Therefore, for node u, d[u] must be of the form g * a for each edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm l, and also d[u] = (g' * a') for the next edge (u, w) with gcd g' and lcm l', etc.\n\n        So, d[u] must be divisible by g, g', ... for all incident edges.\n\n        And then, for each edge (u, v): d[u] * d[v] = g * l.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            Step 1: For each edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm l, let m = l // g.\n\n            Step 2: Factorize m? But m can be up to 10^6, and we have up to 10^6 edges, so factorizing each m might be acceptable (since 10^6 factorization is fast, but 10^6 edges would be 10^6 factorizations, which is too slow).\n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute the divisors for all numbers up to 10^6? That is a known technique.\n\n        But note: the problem constraints say that the numbers (g, l) are up to 10^6, so m = l//g can be up to 10^6.\n\n        However, we are not required to find all divisors for all numbers up to 10^6 for each edge. We can do:\n\n            For each edge, we know m = l//g. Then, we need to find a divisor a of m such that gcd(a, m//a)==1.\n\n        But note: the condition gcd(a, m//a)==1 means that a and m//a are coprime, which is equivalent to saying that a must contain all the prime factors of m that are <= a, and none of the primes in a should appear in m//a. Actually, this means that a must be the product of a subset of the prime factors of m (with full exponents) and the rest of the prime factors form m//a, and they are disjoint.\n\n        In other words, a must be a divisor of m that is square-free in the context of the entire factorization? Actually, no: the condition is that a and m//a are coprime, meaning that a must include one of the two: either all the factors of a prime p in m, or none.\n\n        This is the definition of a divisor that is a product of some subset of the distinct prime factors (with full exponent) of m.\n\n        Example: m = 12 = 2^2 * 3. Then the divisors a that are \"unitary\" (i.e., a and m//a are coprime) are: 1, 4, 3, 12.\n\n        Why? \n          a=1: 1 and 12 -> gcd(1,12)=1 -> valid.\n          a=4: 4 and 3 -> gcd(4,3)=1 -> valid.\n          a=3: 3 and 4 -> valid.\n          a=12: 12 and 1 -> valid.\n\n        But note: 2: 2 and 6 -> gcd(2,6)=2 -> not valid.\n               6: 6 and 2 -> gcd(6,2)=2 -> not valid.\n\n        So the valid a are the divisors that are products of entire prime power factors.\n\n        Therefore, we can precompute the \"unitary divisors\" for m by first factorizing m and then taking the divisors that are the product of the prime factors taken as a whole (each prime factor either fully included or not).\n\n        However, we have up to 10^6 edges and m up to 10^6, and factorizing each m from scratch for each edge would be too slow.\n\n        We can precompute the smallest prime factor (spf) for numbers up to 10^6, then factorize m quickly, but then generating the unitary divisors for each m (which is at most 2^(number of distinct prime factors)) might be acceptable because the number of distinct primes is small (at most 7 for numbers up to 10^6).\n\n        But note: we have up to 10^6 edges, and for each edge we do a factorization and then generate the unitary divisors. The total distinct m might be up to 10^6, but we can cache the factorization and unitary divisors for each m.\n\n        Steps for the entire solution:\n\n          1. Read n, m.\n          2. For each edge, read (u, v, g, l). Check that l % g == 0. If not, output \"NO\" and exit.\n\n          3. Precomputation: \n                - Precompute a spf (smallest prime factor) array for numbers up to 10^6 (or up to max_m, where max_m = max(l//g for each edge) but note g>=1, so l//g <= 10^6, so we can do up to 10^6.\n\n          4. For each edge, let m = l//g. Then, factorize m (using the precomputed spf) and then generate the unitary divisors.\n\n          5. For each edge, we have two nodes u and v. We need to choose a divisor a for u and divisor b for v such that a * b = m and gcd(a, b)=1 (which is equivalent to a being a unitary divisor and b = m//a).\n\n          6. Then, set d[u] = g * a, d[v] = g * b.\n\n          7. But the same node u appears in multiple edges. Therefore, for node u, we must choose a divisor a for each incident edge (u, v) such that:\n\n                d[u] = g1 * a1 = g2 * a2 = ... \n\n            for each edge (u, v) with gcd g_i and corresponding unitary divisor a_i.\n\n            This means that g1 * a1 = g2 * a2.\n\n          8. We can do:\n\n                For each node, collect all the equations: d[u] = g_i * a_i, where a_i is a unitary divisor for the edge (u, v) (with g_i and l_i, so m_i = l_i//g_i, and a_i is a unitary divisor of m_i).\n\n            Then, d[u] must be a common multiple of the g_i's and also divisible by the g_i's, and the ratio d[u] / g_i must be a unitary divisor of m_i.\n\n          9. Alternatively, we can fix the value for one node and then propagate.\n\n        However, note that the problem does not require unique restoration, so we can choose any arrangement.\n\n        We can use a DFS/BFS to assign values:\n\n          - Start with an arbitrary node, assign a value.\n\n          - Then, for each edge, we can compute the neighbor's value from the product condition and then check the gcd condition.\n\n        But the product condition is multiplicative and the gcd condition is additive in the exponents? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n          Let d[u] be the value for node u.\n\n          For an edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm l, we have:\n\n            d[u] * d[v] = g * l   =>   d[v] = (g * l) / d[u]\n\n          And then we require that gcd(d[u], d[v]) = g.\n\n          Also, d[u] must be divisible by g.\n\n          Then, we can do:\n\n            Step 1: Choose an initial node, say node 0, and assign it an initial value. What value? \n\n                    We can assign d[0] = 1.\n\n            Step 2: Then, for each edge from node 0 to a neighbor, we compute d[neighbor] = (g * l) / d[0] = g * l.\n\n            Step 3: Then, for the next edges from the neighbor, we use the computed d[neighbor] to compute further nodes.\n\n            Step 4: When we reach a node, we must check that:\n\n                    a) d[u] is divisible by the gcd of every edge incident to u (but we don't know the edge's gcd until we traverse it).\n\n                    b) For an edge (u, v) that we haven't visited, we can compute d[v] from d[u] and the edge's (g, l): d[v] = (g * l) / d[u]. Then, check that d[v] is an integer and that gcd(d[u], d[v]) == g.\n\n            However, note: the edge condition requires that d[u] is divisible by g. But d[u] might not be divisible by g if we haven't checked.\n\n        Steps for DFS/BFS:\n\n          Let's maintain an array d[0..n-1] for the node values, initially unset.\n\n          We also need to keep track of the edges we've used.\n\n          Algorithm:\n\n            Use a queue/stack for BFS.\n\n            Start with node 0, set d[0] = 1.\n\n            Then, for each edge (0, v) with gcd g0 and lcm l0, set d[v] = (g0 * l0) / d[0] = g0 * l0.\n\n            Then, for node v, check that d[v] is divisible by g0 (it is, since d[v] = g0 * l0, and g0 divides d[v] because l0 is an integer). \n\n            Then, for each edge (v, w) that we haven't visited, set d[w] = (g1 * l1) / d[v], and check:\n\n                  - d[w] must be an integer.\n                  - d[v] must be divisible by g1 (the gcd for edge (v,w)).\n                  - gcd(d[v], d[w]) == g1.\n\n            But note: d[v] = g0 * l0, and g1 might not divide d[v]! \n\n            Example: \n                Edge0: (0, v): g0=1, l0=3",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to restore the number of mushrooms on each lawn (vertex) in a graph based on given roads (edges), where each edge provides the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of the mushroom counts on its two connected lawns. The solution involves verifying the consistency of these GCD and LCM values across all edges and then assigning mushroom counts to each lawn that satisfy all edge conditions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Checks**: For each edge, verify that the given GCD divides the LCM. If not, the arrangement is impossible.\n2. **Graph Traversal**: Use a BFS or DFS approach to traverse the graph starting from an arbitrary node (e.g., node 0). Assign an initial value (usually 1) to the starting node.\n3. **Edge Processing**: For each edge encountered during traversal, compute the mushroom count for the adjacent node using the product of the GCD and LCM divided by the current node's value. Ensure this value is an integer and that the GCD condition is met.\n4. **Validation**: During traversal, check that the computed value for each node adheres to all edge conditions (divisibility by the edge's GCD and correct GCD between connected nodes).\n5. **Output**: If all checks pass, output \"YES\" followed by the mushroom counts for all nodes.
