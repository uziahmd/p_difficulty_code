Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to process the queries in reverse order because the later replacements might affect the earlier ones (e.g., if a digit is replaced by a string that contains digits to be replaced again). However, note that the problem says: \"the queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed\". \n\n But note: if we do the replacements from left to right, then replacing '2' with '00' and then '3' with '' in the example, we must consider that the second replacement (on the transformed string) uses the updated string.\n\n However, there is a catch: the total length of all ti's is at most 10^5, but if we do naive replacements (like using string replace for each query) and there are many queries, the string can become very long. Moreover, the number of queries is up to 10^5, and the initial string is up to 10^5.\n\n But note: the problem says the sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 10^5. However, the entire string s might be built from multiple replacements and could become very large (if we keep replacing, e.g., '1'->\"111\", then the string grows exponentially). We cannot build the entire string explicitly because it might be too long.\n\n Alternative approach: we are only interested in the final number modulo 1000000007.\n\n Idea: Instead of building the entire string, we can use dynamic programming or state machine that tracks the value of the current segment and its length (for modulus operations). But note: the operations are defined on individual digits.\n\n However, note that the problem says: ignore leading zeros, but the replacement does not remove zeros in the middle. Also, the number is built from the entire string (with possible leading zeros, but note: when we have a leading zero, the number still has that many digits? Actually, the problem says: \"ignore the leading zeroes\", meaning that if the resulting string is \"00123\", then the number is 123. But wait, the example outputs do not ignore leading zeros in the sense of the entire string? Let me read the example:\n\n Example 1: Input \"123123\", then query \"2->00\" gives \"10031003\" -> which is 10031003.\n Example 2: Input \"123123\", then query \"3->\" gives \"1212\" -> which is 1212.\n\n But note: the example output is the number, so we have to interpret the entire string as a decimal number (ignoring leading zeros only if the whole number is considered? Actually, the problem says: \"when you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes\". This means that the leading zeros do not count, but the rest do.\n\n However, consider: \n   If the string becomes empty, then the number is 0.\n   Otherwise, the number is the integer represented by the string (which may have leading zeros, but those zeros are ignored). For example, \"000123\" is 123.\n\n But note: the example does not change the leading zeros. In the first example, the string becomes \"10031003\", which is a valid representation (no leading zeros). In the second, \"1212\" has no leading zeros.\n\n However, consider a case: \n   Start with \"0\"\n   Then query \"0->12\"\n   Then the string becomes \"12\", so the number is 12.\n\n But what if we start with \"00\", then query \"0->1\": then we get \"11\", which is 11.\n\n However, the problem says: ignore leading zeros. But note: the entire string is the representation. So if we have a string that starts with zeros, then we remove the zeros until we find a non-zero? Actually, the problem says: \"ignore the leading zeroes\", so the number is the same as if we removed the leading zeros (but note: if the string is all zeros, then we leave one zero? Actually, the standard interpretation is: the number represented by the string is the same as the number represented by the non-empty suffix (if there is at least one non-zero digit). However, the problem says: \"if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero\".\n\n How to handle this?\n\n We can note that the entire string is built from digits, and we want the number mod 1000000007. But the number can be very large. We cannot convert the entire string to an integer if it has more than 15 digits (because Python integers are fine, but the modulus is 10**9+7, and the string might be extremely long, with billions of digits). So we must compute the modulus without building the entire number.\n\n Standard way: \n   We can process the string from left to right, and update the value. But the string is being transformed by multiple replacements.\n\n However, the replacements are global and the same digit might be replaced multiple times. The key is that the queries are given in order, and we must apply them sequentially.\n\n But note: the total length of all ti's is at most 10^5, so we cannot do naive string replacement for each query because the initial string and the intermediate strings might be huge.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n We are asked for the remainder modulo 10^9+7. We can use a technique similar to dynamic programming or state propagation.\n\n Let's define:\n   Let f(s) = the number represented by s modulo 1000000007.\n\n But note: the operations are sequential and each operation replaces every occurrence of a digit d by a string t. \n\n We can process the queries from last to first and maintain a mapping for each digit to what it should be replaced by (and also the effect of the entire transformation on the value). However, we have to account for the fact that the replacement for a digit d in query i might contain digits that are subject to subsequent queries (from i+1 to n). \n\n But note: the problem says the queries are applied in the given order. So if we process in reverse, we can merge the transformations.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We will precompute for each digit (from '0' to '9') what is the transformation that it would undergo after all the queries. However, note that the transformation of a digit might depend on the transformations of the digits in the replacement string.\n\n 2. We can use a list `mapping` for the final transformation for each digit, but the problem is that a digit might be replaced by a string containing multiple digits, and then each of those digits might be replaced again.\n\n However, we can process the queries backwards and for each digit, we define:\n\n   Let `value[d]` be the string (or perhaps a tuple (value, length)) that the digit d is expanded to after all the queries? But note: the expansion is done by the set of queries, and the queries are applied in the given order.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a system of propagation:\n\n   We are going to store for each digit d (from '0' to '9') two things:\n      - The effective string that d expands to after processing all queries (but note: the total length might be too big, but the problem says the total length of all ti's is <= 10^5, and the initial s is 10^5, but the intermediate expansions might be huge).\n\n But wait, the constraints say: the sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 10^5. However, the expansion might cause a chain reaction: initially, we have a string of digits. Each query replaces one digit by a string (which may contain digits that are then subject to the same query set). However, the total length of the input ti's is bounded by 10^5, but the expanded string might be huge (exponential growth). We cannot store the entire expanded string.\n\n We need to compute the number modulo 1000000007. We can represent the transformation for a digit by:\n\n   Let `dp[d]` be a tuple (val, len) for the digit d, where:\n        val = the value (mod 1000000007) of the entire expansion of d through all queries.\n        len = the length (number of digits) of the entire expansion of d through all queries.\n\n Then, when we have a query \"d0 -> t\", we can update the mapping for d0 by:\n\n   Let the current mapping for each digit in t is already computed (if we process backwards). Then:\n\n   The value for the expansion of d0 is the concatenation of the expansions of each digit in t.\n\n   How to concatenate two numbers in modular arithmetic?\n\n   Suppose we have two parts: the first part has value `v1` and length `l1` (so it represents a number that is `v1` and has `l1` digits). Then if we put a second part with value `v2` and length `l2` after it, the new value is:\n\n        v_new = v1 * (10 ** l2) + v2\n\n   And the length is l1 + l2.\n\n But note: the modulus is 1000000007. We can precompute powers of 10 modulo 1000000007, but the length might be very large (we are dealing with the entire expansion). However, we cannot compute 10^(length) for very large lengths (like 10^5 or more) directly because the exponent would be too big.\n\n However, note that the total length of the entire expanded string from the initial s is bounded by the fact that the sum of the lengths of the replacement strings (ti) is at most 10^5, but wait: the expansion is done recursively. The total length of the entire expanded string might be exponential. But the problem constraints say that the sum of the lengths of ti for all queries is <= 10^5. However, the same digit might be replaced multiple times, and we are storing the length for each digit's expansion. The length itself might be huge (exponentially growing) and we cannot store it as an integer because the length can be astronomical.\n\n Alternative approach: we don't care about the actual length, but we need to know the power of 10 for the entire expansion. But wait, we are storing the length to know how to shift the next part.\n\n But note: the modulus is 1000000007, and we are only interested in the value modulo 1000000007. The value of 10^k mod 1000000007 can be computed with modular exponentiation, but k can be huge (like the total length of the expansion). However, by Euler's theorem, since 1000000007 is prime, we can reduce the exponent modulo phi(1000000007) which is 1000000006. But the problem is that the length might be huge, but note: the length is the total number of digits. However, the value of the expansion is computed modulo 1000000007, and the shifting is done by multiplying by 10^(len_of_next) mod 1000000007.\n\n But the length of the expansion for a digit might be huge (exceeding 10^9+7). We cannot store the entire length as an integer because it might be too big. However, we don't actually need the exact length for the modulus computation? Actually, we do: because the shifting factor is 10^(length) mod 1000000007, and we can compute that with modular exponentiation if we know the length (in terms of base-10 digits) modulo (the totient of 1000000007) for modulus exponentiation? But note: the modulus exponentiation for base 10 and modulus 1000000007 requires the exponent modulo phi(1000000007) only if the base and modulus are coprime (which they are, since 10 and 1000000007 are coprime). \n\n However, the length (number of digits) is used both for shifting and for knowing the length of the next part. But note: the modulus operation for the value is independent of the length, but the shifting depends on the length. \n\n But wait: the problem says the total length of all ti's is <= 10^5, but the expansion of a digit might lead to a very long string. However, we are storing for each digit the value and the length (number of digits) of the expansion. We can store the length as an integer, but the length might be too big (exponential in the number of queries). \n\n However, note that the total length of the initial string is 10^5 and the total length of the replacement strings is 10^5, but the chain of expansions can be exponential. But the problem says the sum of the lengths of ti for all queries is 10^5, and the initial string is 10^5, but the number of queries is 10^5. We cannot store the length as an integer because it might have millions or billions of digits, and storing the length (as an integer) would require a big number, but even then, the exponent for the modular exponentiation (for shifting) would be that huge integer, and we cannot compute 10^(huge_int) mod 1000000007 by standard exponentiation (because huge_int might be astronomically large).\n\n We need a different approach.\n\n Insight: Instead of storing the entire expansion for each digit, we can process the entire initial string by propagating the effect of the queries backwards. We are going to process the queries from last to first, and for each query, we update the mapping for the digit in the query. But we don't need the entire string, we just need the value and the length (for the purpose of shifting) for each digit.\n\n However, the length is needed for the shifting, but we can store the length modulo (phi(1000000007))? Actually, for the modulus of exponents in modular exponentiation, we use Euler's theorem, but note: the modulus for the exponent is the totient of the modulus, but here we are shifting the entire value by a certain number of digits (which is the length of the next part). But the length is used in two ways:\n\n   (1) To compute the value: we need to know the length of the next part to shift the current value by that many digits (i.e., multiply by 10^(length)).\n\n   (2) To combine the values: the entire expansion of a digit is the concatenation of the expansions of the digits in the replacement string.\n\n But we can store the value (mod 1000000007) and the length (as an integer) for each digit. However, the length might be huge (exceeding the modulus for exponentiation). But note: the modulus for exponentiation (base 10) is 1000000007, and we can use modular exponentiation with exponent being the length (if we know the length). However, the length might be too big to handle as an exponent (like 10^5 digits, then the exponent is 10^5, which is acceptable because we can compute 10^(10^5) mod 1000000007 using pow(base, exponent, modulus) in Python, but wait: 10^5 is 100000, which is acceptable. However, the length might be the result of many expansions, so it might be much larger than 10^5. \n\n But note: the total length of all replacement strings is 10^5, and the initial string is 10^5, but the expansion is applied repeatedly. The length might become huge (exponential). However, the problem states that the sum of the lengths of ti for all queries is 10^5, but that doesn't bound the expansion length arbitrarily: because one replacement might refer to a digit that was replaced by a long string, and then that long string contains digits that are replaced by long strings, etc.\n\n But note: the problem constraints on the input: the sum of the lengths of ti for all queries is 10^5. This is the total input for the ti's. However, the expansion is defined by the queries, and the same query might be applied multiple times. The key is that we are going to process the queries in reverse order and update the mapping for each digit. We start from the last query and go backwards, and for each digit we store:\n\n   value[d] = the value (mod 1000000007) of the entire expansion of d after all queries.\n   len[d] = the total number of digits (an integer) of the entire expansion of d after all queries.\n\n However, the problem is that the length might be too big to store as an integer (for example, if we have a chain of replacements that multiplies the length by 10 each time, and we do 10^5 queries, then the length could be 10^(10^5) which is way beyond any integer representation).\n\n We must avoid storing the length as an integer. \n\n Alternative: We are only required to compute the final number modulo 1000000007. The shifting is done by multiplying by 10^(L) mod 1000000007, but we can compute 10^(L) mod 1000000007 without knowing L? \n\n Unfortunately, no. We need the exponent L to compute 10^L mod 1000000007. But we can use Euler's theorem to reduce the exponent modulo phi(1000000007)=1000000006. However, note that the modulus for the exponentiation is 1000000007, and 10 and 1000000007 are coprime, so:\n\n   10^L mod 1000000007 = 10^(L mod 1000000006) mod 1000000007   [if L >= 1000000006, we can reduce]\n\n But wait, is that true? Euler's theorem says: a^phi(m) ≡ 1 (mod m) if gcd(a,m)=1. Then a^k mod m = a^(k mod phi(m)) mod m, provided k>=0. But note: this reduction is valid for k>=phi(m)? Actually, it holds for any k if we use the reduced exponent in the range [0, phi(m)-1]. \n\n However, the issue is that the length L might be huge (more than 1000000006), so we can store L modulo 1000000006 (the totient) for the purpose of modular exponentiation? But note: the shifting factor is 10^L, and we can compute that by:\n\n   shift = pow(10, L_mod_phi, 1000000007)\n\n However, we need to know the length L (the actual number of digits) to shift the value. But wait: the shifting factor is 10^L, and we are storing the value of the part we are about to append. The entire value is built by:\n\n   value = (current_value * (10^L)) + next_value\n\n But note: the shifting factor is determined by the length of the next part, and that length is the number of digits. However, if we only store the length modulo 1000000006, then we lose the actual length (because the shifting factor depends on the actual length). \n\n But wait: the shifting factor is 10^L, and we can compute it modulo 1000000007 by:\n\n   shift = pow(10, L, 1000000007)   # but L is huge, but we can use Euler: 10^L mod 1000000007 = 10^(L mod 1000000006) mod 1000000007\n\n However, note: the shifting factor is 10^L, and L is the number of digits. But if we have two different expansions that have the same length modulo 1000000006, then 10^L mod 1000000007 is the same. But the value we are computing is:\n\n   value = (current_value * (10^L)) + next_value\n\n and if we replace L by L + k * 1000000006, then 10^L mod 1000000007 is the same. So we can store the length modulo 1000000006.\n\n However, we also need the total length (the actual length) for the entire expansion to correctly combine the parts? Actually, no. The entire expansion is built by concatenation, and the shifting factor for a part is 10 raised to the length of the following part. But the following part's length is known (modulo 1000000006) for the purpose of modular exponentiation. \n\n But wait: the entire expansion is the concatenation of several parts. The shifting factor for the first part is the total length of the rest. However, the rest is broken down into digits, and we are storing for each digit the value and the length (modulo 1000000006) of its expansion. Then the total length of the rest is the sum of the lengths of the expansions of the digits in the rest (each stored modulo 1000000006). But then the shifting factor is 10^(total_length_rest) mod 1000000007, and we can compute that if we know the total_length_rest modulo 1000000006.\n\n However, the problem is that the length is additive. We can store for each digit:\n\n   value[d] = the value (mod 1000000007) of the expansion of d.\n   len_mod[d] = the length (number of digits) of the expansion of d, modulo 1000000006 (since we only need it for modular exponentiation).\n\n But wait: is that sufficient? Consider two digits d1 and d2. The expansion of d1 is a string of length L1 (actual length, but we store L1_mod = L1 % 1000000006) and similarly for d2. Then the expansion of the string \"d1d2\" is the concatenation, which has length L1 + L2. Then the value is (value[d1] * (10^L2) + value[d2]) mod 1000000007.\n\n Now, if we store the length for d1 as L1_mod and for d2 as L2_mod, then the total length for the concatenation is (L1 + L2) mod 1000000006. But the shifting factor for d1 is 10^(L2) mod 1000000007, and we can compute that from L2_mod. Similarly, the shifting factor for the entire expansion of d1 is 10^(L2 + ... ) but note: the entire rest is the expansion of d2, so we only need the length of the rest (which is L2) for shifting d1. \n\n However, the entire expansion is built from multiple digits. For example, if the expansion of d is \"abc\", and a, b, c are themselves digits that are expanded, then we break d's expansion into the expansions of a, b, c. \n\n Therefore, we can define:\n\n   Let `val[d]` be the value (mod 1000000007) of the entire expansion of d.\n   Let `len_exp[d]` be the length (mod 1000000006) of the entire expansion of d.\n\n Then, for a query \"d0->t\", we can update d0's expansion by:\n\n   val_new = 0\n   len_new = 0   (this will be the total length mod 1000000006)\n\n   For each digit c in the string t:\n        Let v = val[c]   (the expansion of c)\n        Let l = len_exp[c] (the expansion length of c, mod 1000000006)\n\n        Then, the current expansion of d0 is built by appending the expansion of c.\n\n        We have to shift the current value by the length of the next part (which is the entire expansion of c) and then add v.\n\n        But note: we are building from left to right? Actually, the expansion is the concatenation of the expansions of the digits in t. So if t = \"abc\", then the expansion is the expansion of a followed by the expansion of b followed by the expansion of c.\n\n        However, we are processing the string t from left to right. We can do:\n\n            val_new = (val_new * (10 ** (l)) + v) % MOD\n\n        But wait: the shifting factor is 10^(length_of_remaining_part) for the current part? Actually, we are building the entire expansion from left to right. The current part (val_new) is built from the leftmost digits. Then we are going to append the expansion of c. So the current value (val_new) should be shifted by the entire length of the expansion of c (so that the expansion of c comes after it). Then we add the value of the expansion of c.\n\n        However, the above formula does: \n            val_new = (val_new * (10 ** (l)) + v) % MOD\n\n        But note: the expansion of the current part (val_new) is the concatenation of the expansions of the previous digits, and we are appending the expansion of c. This is correct.\n\n        Also, the length of the expansion of d0 is the sum of the lengths of the expansions of the digits in t (each digit in t is expanded and we take their lengths). \n\n        So, we can do:\n\n            len_new = (len_new + l) % PHI   # where PHI = 1000000006\n\n        But wait: the length is the total number of digits, and we are storing it modulo 1000000006. However, the shifting factor for a digit c is 10^(length_of_its_expansion). But note: the expansion of c is stored as `val[c]` and `len_exp[c]`. \n\n        However, the shifting factor for the entire expansion of d0 is the total length of the expansion (which is the sum of the lengths of the expansions of the digits in t). But we are storing the length modulo 1000000006 for the purpose of exponentiation. \n\n        But note: the shifting factor for the entire expansion of d0 is not used until we combine it with other parts (if d0 appears in a larger context). However, the value of d0's expansion is independent of the context. \n\n        Steps for updating a digit d0 with replacement string t:\n\n            Let MOD = 1000000007\n            Let PHI = 1000000006   # Euler's totient of MOD\n\n            val[d0] = 0\n            len_exp[d0] = 0   (this will be the total length mod PHI)\n\n            For each char c in t:\n                digit = c   (a char representing a digit)\n\n                # The current value (val[d0]) is built from the left part. We need to shift it by the length of the expansion of c (to make room for the expansion of c) and then add the expansion of c.\n\n                # But note: the expansion of c is stored in `val[digit]` and `len_exp[digit]` (which is the length of the expansion of c).\n\n                # The shifting factor is 10^(len_exp[digit]) mod MOD, but note: we have stored `len_exp[digit]` modulo PHI, so we can compute:\n\n                shift_factor = pow(10, len_exp[digit], MOD)   # This is 10^(L) mod MOD, where L = (actual expansion length of c) and we are using L mod PHI for the exponent.\n\n                However, wait: we are storing the length of the expansion of c modulo PHI, but the actual length is L, and we are using the property that 10^L mod MOD = 10^(L mod PHI) mod MOD (by Euler). So we can use `len_exp[digit]` (which is L mod PHI) to compute the shift factor.\n\n                Then:\n\n                    val[d0] = (val[d0] * shift_factor + val[digit]) % MOD\n\n                And then update the total length:\n\n                    len_exp[d0] = (len_exp[d0] + len_exp[digit]) % PHI\n\n            But note: the order of the digits in t is important, because the expansion is the concatenation from left to right.\n\n        However, we must process the queries in reverse order. Why? Because the later queries are applied after the earlier ones. So if we process the queries from last to first, then when we update a digit d0, we assume that the digits in the replacement string t for d0 have already been updated by all subsequent queries.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Initialize for each digit d (from '0' to '9'):\n              val[d] = d (the digit itself, but note: the digit d is represented as an integer) mod MOD, and \n              len_exp[d] = 1   (because the digit d is one digit)\n\n          Then, for each query from last to first:\n\n              Parse the query: \"d0->t\"\n\n              Then, update the digit d0:\n\n                  Let t be the string (which may be empty)\n\n                  If t is empty, then the expansion of d0 is an empty string, so:\n\n                      val[d0] = 0\n                      len_exp[d0] = 0\n\n                  Else:\n\n                      For each char c in t:\n                          digit_char = c\n                          digit_int = int(c)   # Actually, we are storing for each character (digit) separately. But note: our mapping is by the digit character.\n\n                          But wait: our mapping is by the character. We have 10 digits: '0','1',...,'9'. \n\n                      However, note: the replacement string t might contain digits that are not d0. We update d0's expansion based on the current mappings (which have been updated by the subsequent queries).\n\n          Then, after processing all queries backwards, we have the final mapping for each digit.\n\n        Finally, we process the initial string s:\n\n          We have to compute the value of the entire string s (which is the concatenation of the expansions of each digit in s) modulo MOD.\n\n          Similarly, we can do:\n\n            result_val = 0\n            result_len = 0   (mod PHI)\n\n            For each char c in s:\n                digit_char = c\n                shift_factor = pow(10, len_exp[digit_char], MOD)   # but wait: we are storing the length for each digit's expansion modulo PHI, so we can compute the shift factor for the entire expansion of that digit.\n\n                Actually, we are building the entire string from left to right. For the digit c, we have its expansion (val[c] and len_exp[c]). Then:\n\n                    result_val = (result_val * (10 ** (len_exp[c])) + val[c]) % MOD\n\n                But again, we can compute 10^(len_exp[c]) mod MOD using the exponent len_exp[c] (which is stored modulo PHI) and then do modular exponentiation.\n\n                Alternatively, we can precompute the shift factors for each digit and store them, but we are updating the mappings.\n\n            However, we can do:\n\n                result_val = 0\n                for c in s:\n                    # The current result_val is the expansion of the part before c.\n                    # We need to shift it by the length of the expansion of c, and then add the expansion of c.\n\n                    shift_factor = pow(10, len_exp[c], MOD)\n                    result_val = (result_val * shift_factor + val[c]) % MOD\n\n            But note: the length of the entire string is the sum of the lengths of the expansions of the digits in s (mod PHI). We don't need the entire length for the final value, but we need it for the shifting.\n\n        However, there is a catch: the initial mapping for each digit d is:\n\n            val[d] = d (as an integer) and len_exp[d] = 1.\n\n        Then, when we process the queries in reverse, we update the digits that are queried.\n\n        Example: \n\n            Input: \"123123\", then query \"2->00\"\n\n            We process the queries in reverse (only one query, so we process it once). The query is \"2->00\".\n\n            Then, for digit '2':\n\n                t = \"00\"\n\n                For the first '0': \n                    val[0] = 0, len_exp[0] = 1\n                For the second '0': same.\n\n                Then, \n                    val['2'] = (0 * (10^1) + 0) * (10^1) + 0) % MOD = 0\n                    But wait, we do:\n\n                        First digit: \n                            val['2'] = 0 * (10^1) + 0 = 0\n                            len_exp['2'] = 1\n\n                        Second digit:\n                            val['2'] = 0 * (10^1) + 0 = 0\n                            len_exp['2'] = (1 + 1) % PHI = 2\n\n                Then, the expansion of '2' is \"00\", which has length 2 and value 0.\n\n            Then, the entire string \"123123\" becomes:\n\n                '1' -> val['1'] = 1, len_exp['1']=1\n                '2' -> val['2']=0, len_exp['2']=2\n                '3' -> val['3']=3, len_exp['3']=1\n\n                Then, the entire value = ( ( ( ( ( ( ( (0)*10^1 + 1) * 10^2 + 0) * 10^1 + 3 ) * 10^1 + 1 ) * 10^2 + 0 ) * 10^1 + 3 )\n\n                Let's break it down:\n\n                    Start: 0\n                    Process '1': \n                        0 * (10^1) + 1 = 1\n                    Process '2':\n                        1 * (10^2) + 0 = 100\n                    Process '3':\n                        100 * (10^1) + 3 = 1003\n                    Process '1':\n                        1003 * (10^1) + 1 = 10031\n                    Process '2':\n                        10031 * (10^2) + 0 = 10031 * 100 = 1003100\n                    Process '3':\n                        1003100 * (10^1) + 3 = 10031003\n\n                Which matches the example.\n\n        But note: the example says the result is 10031003, and the modulus is 1000000007, so 10031003 % 1000000007 = 10031003.\n\n        Another example: \"123123\", query \"3->\" (empty string)\n\n            Update digit '3': \n                t = \"\"\n                Then, set val['3'] = 0, len_exp['3'] = 0.\n\n            Then, the entire string \"123123\":\n\n                '1': 1\n                '2': 0 (from the first example, but wait: we didn't update '2' in this example, so we use the initial mapping for '2'? \n\n            But note: the queries are applied in the given order. In this example, we are only processing one query. However, the example input:\n\n                ['123123\\n1\\n3->', ...]\n\n            So we are updating only the digit '3'. \n\n            Then, the expansion of '3' is empty, so:\n\n                result_val = 0\n                for c in \"123123\":\n                    if c=='3': \n                        shift_factor = 10^0 = 1, and val['3",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a series of queries that transform a given string of digits by replacing each occurrence of a specific digit with another string of digits. The final transformed string should be interpreted as a decimal number, ignoring any leading zeros, and the result should be the remainder when divided by 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reverse Processing of Queries**: Instead of processing each query in the given order, we process them in reverse. This allows us to efficiently handle each digit's transformation by considering all subsequent queries first.\n2. **Dynamic Mapping for Digits**: For each digit (0-9), maintain two pieces of information:\n   - **Value (val)**: The numeric value of the digit's expansion after all transformations, modulo 1000000007.\n   - **Length (len_exp)**: The total number of digits in the expanded string, modulo 1000000006 (Euler's totient function value for 1000000007).\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: When updating a digit's mapping, compute its new value by concatenating the expansions of the digits in its replacement string. The length is updated by summing the lengths of these expansions. Modular exponentiation is used to handle large numbers efficiently.\n4. **Final String Processing**: After processing all queries, compute the final number by iterating through each digit in the original string, using the precomputed mappings to determine its contribution to the final value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 1000000007\nPHI = 1000000006\n\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    val = {}\n    len_exp = {}\n    \n    for digit in '0123456789':\n        val[digit] = int(digit)\n        len_exp[digit] = 1\n    \n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        query_str = input().strip()\n        if '->' in query_str:\n            d0, t = query_str.split('->', 1)\n            d0 = d0.strip()\n            queries.append((d0, t))\n    \n    for i in range(len(queries)-1, -1, -1):\n        d0, t = queries[i]\n        if not t:\n            val[d0] = 0\n            len_exp[d0] = 0\n        else:\n            parts = []\n            for char in t:\n                if char in val:\n                    parts.append((val[char], len_exp[char]))\n                else:\n                    parts.append((int(char), 1))\n            current_val = 0\n            current_len = 0\n            for v, l in parts:\n                shift_factor = pow(10, l, MOD)\n                current_val = (current_val * shift_factor + v) % MOD\n                current_len = (current_len + l) % PHI\n            val[d0] = current_val\n            len_exp[d0] = current_len % PHI\n    \n    result_val = 0\n    for char in s:\n        shift_factor = pow(10, len_exp[char], MOD)\n        result_val = (result_val * shift_factor + val[char]) % MOD\n    \n    print(result_val)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The initial mappings for each digit (0-9) set their value to the digit itself and their length to 1.\n2. **Query Processing**: Queries are read and stored. Each query is processed in reverse order. For each query, the specified digit's value and length are updated based on the replacement string. The replacement string's digits are processed using their current mappings (from subsequent queries), ensuring all transformations are accounted for.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: During updates, the new value is computed by shifting the current value left by the length of the next part (using modular exponentiation) and adding the next part's value. The length is updated by summing the lengths of all parts in the replacement string.\n4. **Final Calculation**: The original string is processed digit by digit. For each digit, its expansion's value and length are used to update the result by shifting the current result and adding the digit's expansion value. The final result is printed modulo 1000000007.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the potentially exponential growth of the string by leveraging modular arithmetic and dynamic mappings, ensuring correctness and performance within constraints.",
