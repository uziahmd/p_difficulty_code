The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is of size w x h (rows x columns).\n We are to add k gilded rings. The first ring goes along the edge of the plate (which is the outer border). \n Each subsequent ring is 2 cells away from the edge, and has a width of 1 cell.\n\n The i-th ring (with i starting at 1) is drawn on the inner rectangle of size:\n   (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1))\n\n However, note that the ring itself is the border of that inner rectangle. The number of cells in the border of an a x b rectangle is:\n   If a >= 3 and b >= 3: then the border (the outer ring) has 2*a + 2*b - 4 (because the four corners are counted twice).\n\n But note: the problem states that the first ring is the entire outer edge of the original plate, so for the first ring we have an outer rectangle of w x h.\n\n However, there's a catch: the rings are drawn inwards. The second ring is drawn on a rectangle that is 2 cells in from each edge, so the inner rectangle for the second ring is (w-4) x (h-4). But note: the second ring is the border of that (w-4) x (h-4) rectangle.\n\n Important: The condition for k is that k must be at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). This means that we won't have a negative dimension.\n\n How to compute the number of cells for the i-th ring?\n   Let the current rectangle for the i-th ring be: \n        a_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        b_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   Then the number of cells in the ring is: 2 * a_i + 2 * b_i - 4, but wait: this formula counts the entire border of a rectangle of size a_i x b_i.\n\n However, note that the example:\n\n Example 1: \"3 3 1\" -> output 8.\n   For i=1: a1 = 3, b1=3 -> 2*3 + 2*3 - 4 = 6+6-4 = 8. Correct.\n\n Example 2: \"7 9 1\" -> output 28.\n   i=1: a1=7, b1=9 -> 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14+18-4 = 32? That doesn't match.\n\n Wait, let me recalc: 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 32, but expected is 28.\n\n Alternatively, consider the example drawing: \n   The first ring for a 7x9 plate: \n        It should be the outer border. The outer border of 7x9 is: \n          top and bottom: 7*2, and the two sides: (9-2)*2 = 7*2, so total 7*2 + 7*2 = 14+14=28.\n\n So what's the correct formula?\n\n Actually, for a rectangle of size a x b, the border (without overlapping corners) is:\n        top and bottom: 2 * a\n        left and right: 2 * (b - 2)   [because the top and bottom rows are already taken, so the sides are from row1 to row a-2, but wait]\n\n But wait: the border includes the entire perimeter. The standard way to compute the perimeter (in terms of cells) for a grid is:\n\n        The top row: a cells (if we think of the rectangle as having a rows and b columns)\n        The bottom row: a cells\n        The two sides: each side has (b-2) cells (because the corners are already counted in top and bottom)\n\n        Total = 2*a + 2*(b-2) = 2a + 2b - 4.\n\n So the same formula: 2a + 2b - 4.\n\n But then for 7x9: 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 32, which is not 28.\n\n What's the discrepancy?\n\n Let me draw a 7x9 grid:\n\n   Row0: 9 cells -> top border: 7 cells? Wait, no: the grid is 7 rows and 9 columns. \n\n   Actually, the grid has:\n        rows: 0 to 6 (7 rows)\n        columns: 0 to 8 (9 columns)\n\n   The outer border:\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. The first ring is placed along the edge of the plate, and each subsequent ring is placed 2 cells inward from the previous one. Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that each ring corresponds to the border of a rectangle that is progressively smaller by 4 cells in both dimensions (since each ring moves 2 cells inward in both directions). The number of cells in each ring can be derived from the perimeter of the respective rectangle.\n2. **Formula Derivation**: For a rectangle of size `a x b`, the number of cells in its border (perimeter) is given by `2*a + 2*b - 4`. This formula accounts for the four corners being counted twice if we simply add the top and bottom rows and the left and right columns.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the dimensions of the rectangle as `(w - 4*(i-1))` for width and `(h - 4*(i-1))` for height. Then apply the perimeter formula to find the number of cells in that ring.\n4. **Edge Handling**: The constraints ensure that the dimensions remain positive and valid for all rings up to `k`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total_cells = 0\n    for i in range(1, k+1):\n        a = w - 4*(i-1)\n        b = h - 4*(i-1)\n        if a <= 0 or b <= 0:\n            break\n        total_cells += 2*a + 2*b - 4\n    print(total_cells)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: `w` (width), `h` (height), and `k` (number of rings).\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the effective width and height by subtracting `4*(i-1)` from the original dimensions. This adjustment accounts for the inward movement of each subsequent ring.\n3. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring's dimensions, compute the number of cells using the formula `2*a + 2*b - 4`, which effectively calculates the perimeter of the rectangle formed by the current ring.\n4. **Output Result**: Sum the cells for all rings and print the total.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the total cells by leveraging geometric properties of rectangles and ensures correctness by handling edge cases where dimensions might become invalid (though the problem constraints prevent such scenarios).",
