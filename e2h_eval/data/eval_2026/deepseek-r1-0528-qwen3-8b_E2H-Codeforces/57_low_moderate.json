His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x in the first line, then two lists of n integers: a (first tour) and b (second tour).\n\n We know that Vasya has at least x points in total. But note: the problem says the results have no names, so we don't know which participant's result is Vasya's.\n\n However, we are told that there exists two indices i and j (which might be the same or different) such that a_i + b_j >= x.\n\n The goal: find the best (lowest) and worst (highest) place Vasya could have gotten.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Since the total score for each participant is the sum of their two tours, we can consider that Vasya's total is at least x, but we don't know exactly.\n\n 2. However, to compute the best and worst place, we need to consider:\n\n    - Best case: We want to assign Vasya's two numbers (from the two lists) such that his total is as high as possible? Actually, wait.\n\n    But note: the problem doesn't specify that we can choose the assignment arbitrarily. The catch is that the two lists are given and we know that Vasya's two numbers must come from one of the pairs (a_i, b_j) and the condition is that the sum is at least x.\n\n    However, the problem does not require knowing Vasya's exact pair. We are allowed to assume that the jury can assign the places arbitrarily in case of ties, but we must consider all possible ways to assign the two lists to participants.\n\n    Actually, we can think: \n\n    We have two lists, and we are going to form a list of all participants, each with two scores (one from the first list and one from the second). But note: the problem says the teacher has the results of the first and the second tour, and the participants' points are given arbitrarily. And Vasya is one of the participants, so his two scores are one from the first list and one from the second.\n\n    However, the problem does not tell us which one is his. So we must consider that Vasya could have any pair (a_i, b_j) as long as the sum is at least x? Actually, no: the problem states that Vasya was present, so his two scores are fixed (but unknown) and the condition is that the total is at least x.\n\n    But note: the input gives two lists of n integers. Each integer in the first list is the score of a participant in the first tour, and similarly for the second.\n\n    Important: The problem says \"the teacher has the results of the first and the second tour\" meaning that we have two multisets of scores.\n\n    How do we proceed?\n\n    We are going to consider the entire set of participants. Each participant is defined by two numbers: one from the first list and one from the second. However, note: the problem does not say that the same participant cannot appear twice in the first list or second list. In fact, the example input: \n        \"5 2\"\n        \"1 1 1 1 1\"\n        \"1 1 1 1 1\"\n\n    So we have 5 participants, each having two ones.\n\n    But note: the problem says \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\". This means that the two lists are of the same length (n) and each participant has one score from the first list and one from the second.\n\n    However, the pairing is arbitrary. The teacher has the two lists, but doesn't know which participant got which score in the first and second tour.\n\n    Therefore, we can form an array of the total scores for each participant by taking one element from the first list and one from the second list, but we are free to assign them arbitrarily? Actually, no: the problem says \"the participants' points are given in the arbitrary order\", meaning that the two lists are independent. But note: each participant must be assigned one score from the first list and one from the second.\n\n    However, wait: the problem says \"the results of the first and the second tour\" are given. So we have two lists of scores, one for the first tour and one for the second. And each participant has one score from the first tour and one from the second. But the pairing is not known.\n\n    Therefore, we can consider that the set of total scores is the set of all possible sums of one element from the first list and one from the second? Not exactly: because we have n participants, and we are going to assign the first list to the participants arbitrarily and the second list arbitrarily? Actually, no: the problem does not say that. It says the teacher has the results of the two tours, meaning two multisets. Then, we know that each participant has one score from the first tour and one from the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible places Vasya could have achieved in an Olympiad based on the given scores from two tours. The key insight is that Vasya's total score must be at least `x`, and we need to find the optimal pairing of scores from the two lists to minimize and maximize his rank.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - We are given two lists of integers, `a` (first tour scores) and `b` (second tour scores). Each participant has one score from each list, but the pairing is unknown.\n   - Vasya's total score (sum of his two scores) is at least `x`.\n   - The participants are ranked by their total scores in descending order. In case of ties, the jury can assign ranks arbitrarily.\n\n2. **Intuition**:\n   - **Best Place**: To achieve the best place (highest rank), we need to pair Vasya's scores such that his total is as high as possible, and the number of participants with higher totals is minimized.\n   - **Worst Place**: To achieve the worst place (lowest rank), we need to pair Vasya's scores such that his total is as low as possible (but still ≥ `x`), and the number of participants with higher totals is maximized.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting**: Both lists `a` and `b` are sorted to facilitate efficient pairing.\n   - **Two Pointers Technique**: For the best place, we use two pointers to count how many participants can have a total score higher than Vasya's maximum possible total. For the worst place, we similarly count participants who can have higher totals when Vasya's total is minimized.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - Sorting both lists takes O(n log n) time.\n   - The two-pointer traversal is O(n), making the overall complexity O(n log n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    \n    a_list = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b_list = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+2*n]))\n    \n    a_list.sort()\n    b_list.sort()\n    \n    best_place = 1\n    worst_place = 1\n    \n    # Prepare for best place calculation\n    j = n - 1\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        while j >= 0 and a_list[i] + b_list[j] > x:\n            j -= 1\n        if j < 0:\n            break\n            \n    best_place = n - j\n    if best_place == 0:\n        best_place = 1\n        \n    # Prepare for worst place calculation\n    k = n - 1\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        if a_list[i] + b_list[k] >= x:\n            k -= 1\n        else:\n            break\n            \n    worst_place = n - k - 1\n    if worst_place == 0:\n        worst_place = 1\n        \n    print(f\"{best_place} {worst_place}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into individual components. The first two values are `n` (number of participants) and `x` (minimum total score). The next `n` values are the first tour scores, followed by the second tour scores.\n2. **Sorting**: Both lists of scores are sorted to facilitate efficient pairing using the two-pointer technique.\n3. **Best Place Calculation**:\n   - We start from the highest possible score in `a_list` and find the smallest score in `b_list` such that their sum exceeds `x`. This helps in determining how many participants can potentially have a higher total score than Vasya's best possible total.\n4. **Worst Place Calculation**:\n   - We start from the highest possible score in `b_list` and find the smallest score in `a_list` such that their sum is at least `x`. This helps in determining how many participants can potentially have a higher total score than Vasya's worst possible total.\n5. **Output**: The best and worst possible ranks are printed, calculated based on the counts from the two-pointer traversals.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible rankings by leveraging sorting and linear scans, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
