Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering the gaps between lanterns.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line for n and l.\n 2. Read the next line which contains n integers (lantern positions).\n 3. Sort the list of lantern positions.\n 4. The entire street must be covered from 0 to l.\n\n Note: The lanterns at a position x light the interval [x-d, x+d]. But note that we have multiple lanterns.\n\n We can break the problem into two parts:\n   a) The leftmost part: from 0 to the first lantern.\n   b) The gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n   c) The rightmost part: from the last lantern to l.\n\n However, note that if a lantern is at position 0, then the left end is already covered (since d>=0). Similarly, if a lantern is at l, then the right end is covered.\n\n How to compute the required d?\n\n Idea:\n 1. The entire street must be covered. So, we need to cover from 0 to l.\n\n 2. Consider the gaps:\n    - The left gap: from 0 to the first lantern. The first lantern at position a0 must cover from 0 to at least a0. The required d for the left side is a0/2 (because the lantern at a0 must extend to 0, so d must be at least a0/2).\n\n    - The gaps between lanterns: between two consecutive lanterns at positions a_i and a_{i+1}. The gap is a_{i+1} - a_i. To cover this gap, we need a lantern with light that reaches from at least a_i + d to a_{i+1} - d. Actually, the condition is that the right side of the left lantern (a_i + d) must meet or exceed the left side of the next lantern (a_{i+1} - d). But note: we can also think that the maximum gap between two consecutive lanterns (say g) must be covered by having the two lanterns together. The minimal d needed for the gap is (g)/2.\n\n    - The right gap: from the last lantern to l. The last lantern at position a_last must cover up to l. Therefore, the required d is (l - a_last) (but wait: actually, the lantern at a_last must reach l, so d must be at least (l - a_last)).\n\n However, note that the entire street is lit if we have:\n   d >= (a0) / 2   [for the left gap]\n   for each i from 0 to n-2: d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2   [for the gap between consecutive lanterns]\n   d >= (l - a_last)   [for the right gap]\n\n But wait: the right gap is not symmetric. Actually, the requirement for the right gap is that the last lantern must cover up to l. The coverage of the last lantern is [a_last - d, a_last + d]. We require a_last + d >= l. Therefore, d >= l - a_last.\n\n However, note that in the left gap, we require d >= a0 (if we think about the leftmost point being 0 and the first lantern at a0, then the distance from a0 to 0 is a0, so d must be at least a0). But wait, the lantern at a0 covers from a0-d to a0+d. For the leftmost part, we require that 0 is covered, so a0-d <= 0 is always true (since d>=0 and a0>=0) but we require that the light goes to 0. Actually, we require that the light from the first lantern extends to 0. The condition is: a0 - d <= 0 -> d >= a0. However, note that if the first lantern is at 0, then d>=0 is enough. But wait, what if the first lantern is not at 0? Then we require d >= a0 (to cover from 0 to a0). However, consider:\n\n Example: \n   n=1, l=5, lantern at 3.\n   Then the coverage is [3-d, 3+d]. We require 3-d <= 0 and 3+d >= 5.\n   Actually, the left condition: 3-d <= 0 -> d>=3. But wait, the entire street is from 0 to 5. The left gap is from 0 to 3 and the right gap is from 3 to 5.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think of the entire street as being covered if:\n      0 is covered: so the leftmost lantern (if any) must cover 0. If there is no lantern at 0, then the first lantern must cover from 0 to its position. The necessary condition for the left gap is that the first lantern's coverage (from the left) must reach 0. Therefore, d must be at least a0 (the distance from the first lantern to 0). Similarly, for the right gap, the last lantern must have d at least (l - a_last). And for the gaps between two consecutive lanterns, the gap is (a_{i+1} - a_i), and to cover the gap, the two adjacent lanterns must have their lights meet. The meeting point: the left lantern must cover up to a_i + d, and the right lantern must cover from a_{i+1} - d. We require a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d -> 2*d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) -> d >= (a_{i+1}-a_i)/2.\n\n Therefore, we have three cases:\n\n   candidate1 = a0 / 2.0   # because the leftmost point is 0, and the first lantern at a0 must cover 0: so d must be at least a0 (but wait, actually the leftmost point 0 must be within a0-d, so d>=a0). However, note: the entire street might be covered by multiple lanterns. But the leftmost point is only covered by the first lantern (if there's one at a0). So d must be at least a0.\n\n   But wait, let me clarify: the lantern at a0 covers [a0-d, a0+d]. To cover 0, we require a0-d <= 0 -> d>=a0. Similarly, for the last lantern at a_last: we require a_last+d >= l -> d>=l-a_last.\n\n   However, the example input: \"2 5\\n2 5\" -> output 2.0.\n\n   Let's check: \n        n=2, l=5, lanterns at [2,5]\n        Left gap: from 0 to 2 -> requires d>=2 (so that the first lantern covers from 0 to 4)\n        Right gap: from 5 to 5 (last lantern at 5) -> requires d>=0 (since 5+d>=5 is always true for d>=0). \n        But wait, the entire street is from 0 to 5. The first lantern covers [2-d, 2+d] and the second [5-d,5+d].\n\n        The gap between 2 and 5 is 3. The condition for the gap: d must be at least (5-2)/2 = 1.5.\n\n        Then the answer would be the maximum of [2, 1.5] which is 2.0.\n\n   Now, let's consider the example: n=1, l=5, lantern at 3.\n        Left gap: d>=3 (to cover from 0 to 3)\n        Right gap: d>=5-3=2\n        Gap between: none (only one lantern)\n        Then the answer is max(3,2) = 3.0.\n\n   But wait, if we set d=3, then the lantern at 3 covers [0,6] which covers [0,5]. So yes, 3 is correct.\n\n   However, note that the middle gap (between two consecutive lanterns) is covered by the condition that the two adjacent lanterns must meet. But in the case of one lantern, we don't have a gap condition between two, but we have the left and right conditions.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n        candidates = []\n\n        # Left edge: from 0 to the first lantern\n        if the first lantern is at 0, then no problem, but if not, then we require d >= first_lantern_position (because the lantern at a0 must cover 0: a0 - d <= 0 -> d>=a0)\n\n        Actually, the left edge condition: the leftmost point is 0. The first lantern is at a0. The distance from 0 to a0 is a0. To cover 0, the lantern at a0 must have d at least a0 (so that a0-d <= 0).\n\n        Similarly, the right edge: the last lantern is at a_last, and we require a_last+d >= l -> d>=l - a_last.\n\n        For the gaps between consecutive lanterns: for two consecutive lanterns at a_i and a_{i+1}, the gap is g = a_{i+1} - a_i. The two lanterns must cover the entire gap. The left lantern covers up to a_i + d, and the right lantern covers from a_{i+1} - d. To cover the gap, we require a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d -> d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2.\n\n        Then the answer is the maximum of:\n          candidate_left = a0   (if a0>0, then we need at least a0; if a0==0, then 0 is fine, but note: we can have d=0 then, but we are looking for minimal d)\n          candidate_right = l - a_last\n          candidate_mid = for each gap: (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2\n\n        However, note: the left edge condition is actually the same as the gap condition for the very beginning? Actually, we can unify by thinking of the entire street as having virtual lanterns at the edges? But no, we are given the lanterns.\n\n        But wait, the left edge condition is not symmetric to the mid gap. The mid gap condition is for two existing lanterns. The left edge condition is for the segment from 0 to the first lantern. Similarly, the right edge is from the last lantern to l.\n\n        So the minimal d must be at least:\n          d >= max( \n            a0,   # to cover the left edge (from 0 to a0)\n            l - a_last,   # to cover the right edge (from a_last to l)\n            (max_gap_between_consecutive_lanterns) / 2.0   # for the gaps between consecutive lanterns\n          )\n\n        However, wait: the left edge condition is a0, but consider: if we have two lanterns, one at 0 and one at 5, then the left edge condition is 0 (since a0=0) and the gap condition for the gap from 0 to 5 is (5-0)/2 = 2.5, and the right edge condition is 5-5=0. So then d=2.5. But let's check: \n            lanterns at 0 and 5, with d=2.5: \n                first lantern: [0-2.5, 0+2.5] = [-2.5, 2.5] -> covers 0 to 2.5\n                second lantern: [5-2.5,5+2.5] = [2.5,7.5] -> covers from 2.5 to 5, but the street is only up to 5, so the whole street [0,5] is covered.\n\n        However, note the gap between 0 and 5 is 5. The condition for the gap is that the two lanterns must meet: the first lantern must go at least to 5? Actually, no, the second lantern starts at 5. The gap is from 0 to 5, but the first lantern covers up to 2.5 and the second starts at 2.5 (from the first lantern's coverage) and goes to 5. So the meeting point is 2.5, which is exactly the gap condition (d>= (5-0)/2 = 2.5). \n\n        But wait, the left edge condition was 0 (a0=0) so that condition is satisfied by any d>=0. The right edge condition is 0 (because l - a_last = 5-5=0). The gap condition gives 2.5.\n\n        Now, consider if the first lantern is at 0 and the last at 5, then the entire street is covered if d>=2.5.\n\n        However, what if we have a0=0 and a_last=5, but there are other lanterns in between? The condition for the gaps between consecutive lanterns might require a larger d.\n\n        But note: the above formula for the left edge condition is: d>=a0. In the example above, a0=0 so that condition is 0. But if we have a0=0 and the next lantern is at 1, then the gap condition for the first gap (0 to 1) is (1-0)/2=0.5, which is less than the condition from the right edge? Actually, the right edge condition is still 5-5=0.\n\n        Now, what if we have a lantern at 0 and then the next is at 10, and the street ends at 10 (so l=10)? Then:\n            left edge: d>=0\n            right edge: d>=10-10=0\n            gap: (10-0)/2=5\n\n        So d must be at least 5.\n\n        Check: \n            first lantern: [0-5,0+5] = [-5,5] -> covers up to 5, so the next lantern at 10 must cover from 5 to 10. The second lantern: [10-5,10+5]=[5,15] -> so the entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n        But note: the condition for the gap is the same as the condition that the two lanterns must meet. The first lantern must cover up to 10? No, the first lantern only needs to cover up to 5, and the second lantern starts at 5. This is correct.\n\n        However, wait: the left edge condition was a0 (which is 0) and that's okay. The gap condition is (10-0)/2=5. So the answer is 5.\n\n        But what if the street length is 10 and we have two lanterns at 0 and 10? Then the gap condition is 5, so d=5. This matches.\n\n        But now, what if we have more than two lanterns? For example, three lanterns: [0, 5, 10] and l=10.\n\n        Conditions:\n            left edge: 0 -> condition 0\n            right edge: 10-10=0\n            gaps: \n                gap1: 5-0=5 -> condition 5/2=2.5\n                gap2: 10-5=5 -> condition 5/2=2.5\n\n            Then the answer is max(0,0,2.5)=2.5.\n\n        Check: \n            d=2.5\n            first lantern (0): [0-2.5, 0+2.5] = [-2.5, 2.5] -> covers up to 2.5\n            second lantern (5): [5-2.5,5+2.5] = [2.5,7.5] -> covers from 2.5 to 7.5\n            third lantern (10): [10-2.5,10+2.5] = [7.5,12.5] -> covers from 7.5 to 10.\n\n            The entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n          Step 1: Read n, l and the list of lanterns.\n          Step 2: Sort the list of lanterns.\n          Step 3: \n              candidate1 = 0.0   # if there's a lantern at 0, then the left edge is covered by d=0, but we might have a gap condition that requires more.\n\n          Actually, we can compute:\n\n          left_gap = a[0] - 0   # but wait, we require the first lantern to cover the left edge: so the d must be at least a[0] (if we consider the left edge condition). However, note: the left edge condition is that the first lantern must cover 0, so d>=a[0] (if a[0] is the first lantern's position). But wait, in our previous example with [0,5,10] the first lantern is at 0, so we require d>=0.\n\n          However, note: if the first lantern is at 0, then the condition is automatically satisfied by any d>=0. But if the first lantern is not at 0, then we require d>=a[0].\n\n          Similarly, for the right edge: d>=l - a[-1].\n\n          For the gaps between consecutive lanterns, we look at each consecutive pair (a[i], a[i+1]) and compute (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.0.\n\n          Then, the minimal d is the maximum among:\n            candidate_left = a[0]   (if the first lantern is not at 0, then we must have d>=a[0]; but if the first lantern is at 0, then 0 is acceptable, and the gap condition might be positive)\n            candidate_right = l - a[-1]\n            candidate_mid = max( (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.0 for all i from 0 to n-2 )\n\n          However, note: the condition for the left edge is not just a[0] because the lantern at a[0] must cover from 0 to a[0]. The distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0], so d must be at least a[0] (because the lantern at a[0] must reach 0). Similarly, the condition for the right edge is that the last lantern must reach l, so d>= l - a[-1].\n\n          But wait: what if there are multiple lanterns? The left edge condition is independent of the gaps. The entire street must be covered from 0 to l.\n\n          However, consider: if we set d = max(a[0], l - a[-1], max_gap/2), then the entire street is covered.\n\n          Why? \n            - The left edge: the first lantern at a[0] will cover from a[0]-d to a[0]+d. Since d>=a[0], then a[0]-d <= 0 is satisfied (because d>=a[0] -> a[0]-d<=0). Also, the left edge is covered.\n            - The right edge: the last lantern at a[-1] will cover from a[-1]-d to a[-1]+d. Since d>=l - a[-1], then a[-1]+d>=l is satisfied (because a[-1]+d >= a[-1] + (l - a[-1]) = l). So the right edge is covered.\n            - The gaps: for each consecutive pair, the gap is (a[i+1]-a[i]). The two lanterns will cover from a[i]-d to a[i]+d and a[i+1]-d to a[i+1]+d. The condition for the gap is that the two intervals must overlap or meet. The condition we used is that the midpoint of the gap must be covered. Actually, we require that the first lantern's coverage extends to at least a[i+1]-d, i.e., a[i]+d >= a[i+1]-d -> 2*d>=a[i+1]-a[i] -> d>= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n          Therefore, the answer is the maximum of these three values.\n\n        Example: \n          Input: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n            n=2, l=5, lanterns=[2,5]\n            candidate_left = 2\n            candidate_right = 5-5 = 0\n            candidate_mid = (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n            Then answer = max(2,0,1.5)=2.0\n\n        Another example: \n          Input: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n            First, sort the lanterns: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n            candidate_left = 0\n            candidate_right = 15-15 = 0\n            candidate_mid = max( (3-0)/2, (5-3)/2, (7-5)/2, (9-7)/2, (14-9)/2, (15-14)/2 )\n                = max(1.5, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.5, 0.5) = 2.5\n            Then answer = max(0,0,2.5)=2.5\n\n        The sample output for the first example is 2.5000000000, and the second example is 2.0000000000.\n\n        However, note: the example input provided in the problem is:\n          Input: \n            ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n          Output:\n            ['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n        But wait, the first sample input has 7 lanterns and l=15. The sorted list is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. The largest gap is between 9 and 14: 5, so 5/2=2.5. Then the answer is 2.5.\n\n        However, note that the left edge condition is 0 (because the first lantern is at 0) and the right edge condition is 0 (because the last lantern is at 15). So the answer is 2.5.\n\n        But wait, is 2.5 sufficient for the entire street? \n          The lanterns: \n            0: covers [-2.5, 2.5] -> covers from 0 to 2.5\n            3: covers [0.5, 5.5] -> meets the gap from 2.5 to 0.5? Actually, the gap from 2.5 to 3 is covered by the second lantern starting at 0.5 (which is less than 3) but wait, the second lantern is at 3, so it covers [3-2.5, 3+2.5] = [0.5,5.5]. So the segment from 0 to 0.5 is covered by the first lantern, then from 0.5 to 5.5 by the second, and so on.\n\n        However, note that the entire street is 15. The last lantern is at 15, so it covers [12.5, 17.5] which covers the end. The gap between 14 and 15: 15-14=1 -> requires d>=0.5, which is satisfied by 2.5.\n\n        But wait, the gap between 9 and 14 is 5, so we require d>=2.5. Then the lantern at 9 covers [9-2.5, 9+2.5] = [6.5, 11.5] and the lantern at 14 covers [14-2.5,14+2.5]=[11.5,16.5]. So the entire street from 0 to 15 is covered.\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n          Read n and l.\n          Read the list of n integers.\n          Sort the list.\n\n          candidate_left = arr[0]   # the distance from 0 to the first lantern\n          candidate_right = l - arr[-1]   # the distance from the last lantern to l\n\n          candidate_mid = 0.0\n          for i in range(n-1):\n              gap = arr[i+1] - arr[i]\n              candidate_mid = max(candidate_mid, gap/2.0)\n\n          ans = max(candidate_left, candidate_right, candidate_mid)\n\n          Print ans with formatting to have 10 decimal places.\n\n        However, wait: is candidate_left really the distance from 0 to the first lantern? Yes, because we require the first lantern to cover 0, so d must be at least the distance from the first lantern to 0, which is arr[0] (since the first lantern is at arr[0] and 0 is at the beginning). \n\n        But note: if the first lantern is at 0, then candidate_left is 0. That's correct.\n\n        One more corner: if there is only one lantern and it is at 0, then the entire street must be covered by that one lantern. Then candidate_left = 0, candidate_right = l - 0 = l, and candidate_mid doesn't exist (n=1, so the loop doesn't run). Then ans = max(0, l, 0) = l. \n\n        Example: n=1, l=15, lantern at 0. Then the lantern must cover from 0 to 15. The coverage is [0-d,0+d] but we set d=l=15, so the coverage is [-15,15] which includes [0,15]. Correct.\n\n        But wait, what if the single lantern is not at 0 or l? \n\n        Example: n=1, l=15, lantern at 7. Then candidate_left = 7 (distance from 0 to 7) and candidate_right = 15-7=8. Then ans = max(7,8) = 8. \n\n        Check: with d=8, the lantern at 7 covers [7-8,7+8]=[-1,15] -> which covers the entire street [0,15]. Correct.\n\n        However, is 8 the minimal? \n          The left edge: we require d>=7 (to cover 0: 7-d<=0 -> d>=7)\n          The right edge: d>=8 (to cover 15: 7+d>=15 -> d>=8)\n          The gap condition: none (so the maximum is 8).\n\n        So the code should work.\n\n        But wait: what if the first lantern is beyond 0? The problem says the lanterns are at points ai (0<=ai<=l). So the first lantern is at least 0.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n        Steps:\n\n          n, l = map(int, input().split())\n          arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          arr.sort()\n\n          candidate_left = arr[0]   # if the first lantern is at arr[0], then to cover 0 we need d>=arr[0]\n          candidate_right = l - arr[-1]\n\n          candidate_mid = 0.0\n          for i in range(len(arr)-1):\n              gap = arr[i+1] - arr[i]\n              # The gap between two consecutive lanterns is gap. The minimal d for this gap is gap/2.0.\n              candidate_mid = max(candidate_mid, gap/2.0)\n\n          ans = max(candidate_left, candidate_right, candidate_mid)\n\n          Format the answer to have 10 decimal places.\n\n        However, note: the example input may have duplicate lanterns? The problem says: \"Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point.\" \n\n        Example: two lanterns at 0. Then the gap between them is 0, and the left edge condition is 0, the right edge condition depends on the last lantern. But note: the last lantern is 0 (if all are 0) then candidate_right = l - 0 = l. \n\n        Example: n=3, l=10, lanterns=[0,0,0]. Then the entire street must be covered by these lanterns. The left edge condition is 0, the right edge condition is 10, and the gaps are 0. Then the answer is 10.\n\n        Check: with d=10, the lanterns at 0 cover [-10,10] which covers [0,10]. Correct.\n\n        But wait, is 10 the minimal? \n          The left edge: d>=0 (ok)\n          The right edge: d>=10 (required)\n          The gaps: 0 (so no problem)\n\n        Therefore, the answer is 10.\n\n        However, if we have two lanterns at 0 and one at 10 (n=3, l=10, lanterns=[0,0,10]): \n            candidate_left = 0\n            candidate_right = 0\n            gaps: [0,0] -> gap1=0, [0,10] -> gap2=10 -> candidate_mid = max(0, 10/2)=5.0\n            Then ans = max(0,0,5)=5.\n\n        Check: d=5, then the two lanterns at 0 cover [-5,5] and the lantern at 10 covers [5,15]. So the entire street [0,10] is covered. Correct.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n        Note: if n==0, then there are no lanterns. Then we must cover the entire street [0,l] with no lanterns. Then d must be at least l/2? Actually, we need one lantern to cover the entire street. The minimal d for one lantern to cover [0,l] is d such that the lantern placed optimally (at the center) would be d>=l/2. But wait, if there are no lanterns, then we cannot use any lantern. However, the problem says \"n lanterns\", and n>=1 (given in the input constraints: n>=1). So we don't have to handle n=0.\n\n        Code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        arr.sort()\n        if n == 0:\n            # According to the problem, n>=1, so we skip.\n            print(0.0)\n        else:\n            cand_left = arr[0]\n            cand_right = l - arr[-1]\n            cand_mid = 0.0\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                gap = arr[i+1] - arr[i]\n                cand_mid = max(cand_mid, gap/2.0)\n\n            ans = max(cand_left, cand_right, cand_mid)\n            print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n        However, wait: the example input \"2 5\\n2 5\" gives 2.0, which is correct.\n\n        But let me test with the example \"1 10\\n7\": \n            n=1, l=10, arr=[7]\n            cand_left = 7\n            cand_right = 10-7=3\n            cand_mid: no loop -> remains 0.0\n            ans = max(7,3,0)=7.0\n\n        But wait, the example above said for one lantern at 7, the answer should be 8? Let me check:\n\n            Condition for left edge: d>=7 (to cover 0: 7-d<=0 -> d>=7)\n            Condition for right edge: d>=3 (to cover 10: 7+d>=10 -> d>=3)\n\n            Then the minimal d is max(7,3)=7.\n\n            With d=7, the lantern at 7 covers [0,14] (since 7-7=0, 7+7=14) -> which covers [0,10]. Correct.\n\n        Why did I think 8 earlier? Because I thought the condition for the right edge was 8? Let me recalc: \n            For the right edge: we require 7+d>=10 -> d>=3. So 3 is the minimal for the right edge, and 7 for the left edge. So the maximum is 7.\n\n        I must have miscalculated earlier. The example with one lantern at 7 for l=10: \n            left edge: d>=7\n            right edge: d>=3\n            so answer=7.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        However, wait: the condition for the left edge is d>=a0 (the first lantern's position). In the example with one lantern at 7, a0=7, so we require d>=7. But note: the condition for the left edge is that the lantern must cover 0. The distance from the lantern at 7 to 0 is 7, so yes, d must be at least 7.\n\n        The condition for the right edge: the distance from the lantern to l (10) is 3, so d must be at least 3.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        Let me run through the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: Input \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n            Sorted: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n            cand_left = 0\n            cand_right = 15-15=0\n            gaps: \n                3-0=3 -> 1.5\n                5-3=2 -> 1.0\n                7-5=2 -> 1.0\n                9-7=2 -> 1.0\n                14-9=5 -> 2.5\n                15-14=1 -> 0.5\n            cand_mid = 2.5\n            ans = max(0,0,2.5)=2.5 -> matches.\n\n        Example 2: Input \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n            Sorted: [2,5]\n            cand_left = 2\n            cand_right = 0\n            gap: 5-2=3 -> 1.5\n            ans = max(2,0,1.5)=2 -> matches.\n\n        Example 3: Input \"1 15\\n0\"\n            cand_left=0, cand_right=15, cand_mid=0 -> ans=15.0\n\n        Example 4: Input \"1 15\\n7\"\n            cand_left=7, cand_right=8, cand_mid=0 -> ans=8.0? Wait, wait: \n                Actually, for one lantern at 7, l=15: \n                    cand_left = 7 (to cover 0: 7-d<=0 -> d>=7)\n                    cand_right = 15-7=8 (to cover 15: 7+d>=15 -> d>=8)\n                    so ans = max(7,8)=8.0\n\n            Check: d=8, the lantern at 7 covers [7-8,7+8] = [-1,15] -> covers [0,15]. Correct.\n\n        But wait, in the example above I had l=10 and one lantern at 7: then cand_right=10-7=3, and cand_left=7, so ans=7. \n\n        So the code is consistent.\n\n        However, note: the condition for the left edge is the distance from the first lantern to 0, and for the right edge the distance from the last lantern to l. \n\n        The code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        arr.sort()\n\n        cand_left = arr[0] if n > 0 else 0\n        cand_right = l - arr[-1] if n > 0 else 0\n\n        # But note: the problem states n>=1, so we can assume n>0.\n\n        cand_mid = 0.0\n        if n > 1:\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                gap = arr[i+1] - arr[i]\n                cand_mid = max(cand_mid, gap/2.0)\n        else:\n            # if n==1, then no gaps, so cand_mid remains 0.0\n            pass\n\n        ans = max(cand_left, cand_right, cand_mid)\n\n        However, if n==0, the problem says n>=1, so we don't need to handle n==0.\n\n        But note: the input constraint says n>=1.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        arr.sort()\n\n        cand_left = arr[0]\n        cand_right = l - arr[-1]\n        cand_mid = 0.0\n\n        for i in range(len(arr)-1):\n            gap = arr[i+1] - arr[i]\n            if gap/2.0 > cand_mid:\n                cand_mid = gap/2.0\n\n        ans = max(cand_left, cand_right, cand_mid",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` required for all lanterns to illuminate the entire street from point `0` to point `l`. The solution involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the edges of the street to find the smallest `d` that ensures complete coverage.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The street is a straight line from `0` to `l`, with `n` lanterns placed at various positions. Each lantern illuminates all points within a distance `d` on both sides. The goal is to find the smallest `d` such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern.\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Left Edge Coverage**: The first lantern must cover the starting point `0`. If the first lantern is at position `a[0]`, then `d` must be at least `a[0]` to ensure `0` is covered.\n   - **Right Edge Coverage**: The last lantern must cover the end point `l`. If the last lantern is at position `a[-1]`, then `d` must be at least `l - a[-1]` to ensure `l` is covered.\n   - **Gap Coverage**: For any two consecutive lanterns at positions `a[i]` and `a[i+1]`, the distance between them is `a[i+1] - a[i]`. To ensure these lanterns cover the gap between them, `d` must be at least half this distance, i.e., `(a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves sorting the lantern positions, then computing three values:\n   - The left edge requirement (`a[0]`).\n   - The right edge requirement (`l - a[-1]`).\n   - The maximum gap requirement between any two consecutive lanterns (`(max_gap) / 2`).\n   The minimal `d` is the maximum of these three values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = int(data[1])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    arr.sort()\n    \n    cand_left = arr[0]\n    cand_right = l - arr[-1]\n    cand_mid = 0.0\n    \n    if n > 1:\n        for i in range(n-1):\n            gap = arr[i+1] - arr[i]\n            mid_val = gap / 2.0\n            if mid_val > cand_mid:\n                cand_mid = mid_val\n                \n    ans = max(cand_left, cand_right, cand_mid)\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns `n`, the street length `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate gap analysis.\n3. **Edge Calculations**:\n   - `cand_left` is the distance from the first lantern to the start of the street (`arr[0]`).\n   - `cand_right` is the distance from the end of the street to the last lantern (`l - arr[-1]`).\n4. **Gap Analysis**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the gap between them is calculated. The required `d` to cover this gap is half the gap distance. The largest such value is stored in `cand_mid`.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The minimal `d` is the maximum of `cand_left`, `cand_right`, and `cand_mid`, ensuring all parts of the street are covered. The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places. \n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to determine the minimal light radius required, leveraging sorting and linear scans to handle the problem constraints effectively.",
