Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\n We are given two points (home and university) and a set of n lines (roads). The roads divide the plane into blocks. We can move from one block to another if they share a common border of nonzero length.\n\n Observation: Each road is an infinite line. The movement condition is that two blocks must share a common segment (not just a point). This is equivalent to saying we can cross a road only by stepping into an adjacent block at the crossing of two or more roads? Actually, note that when you cross one road, you step from one block to an adjacent block. But the problem says: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". \n\n However, note: the common border is defined by the intersection of two roads? Actually, no: the common border between two blocks is a segment of one of the roads. But wait, the problem states that the roads are infinite lines. The blocks are separated by these lines. So two adjacent blocks share a portion of one of the roads as their common border.\n\n But then how do we move? We can cross one road at a time. Therefore, each crossing of a road (from one side to the other) is a step. However, note the example: \n\n Example 1:\n   Input: \n        Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1)\n        Roads: \n            0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0   -> y=0 (the x-axis)\n            1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0   -> x=0 (the y-axis)\n\n        Output: 2\n\n Explanation: The home (1,1) is in the first quadrant, the university (-1,-1) is in the third quadrant. To get from (1,1) to (-1,-1), we must cross both the x-axis and the y-axis. Each crossing is a step. However, note: when we cross one road, we move to an adjacent block. Then we might be at the origin (if we cross one road, then we are in a different block, but the next road is also there). But wait, the problem says we can only move if the common border is nonzero. So we cannot jump from one block to a non-adjacent one without crossing the intermediate roads.\n\n However, note that the movement is defined by crossing roads. But here's the catch: we are allowed to cross multiple roads at once? Actually, the problem says: \"if the length of their common border is nonzero\" — meaning we can cross one road at a time, and that would connect two blocks that share a segment of that road. But we cannot cross two roads at the same step because the common border between two blocks is only one road (unless two roads meet at a point and form a common border for two adjacent blocks? Actually, no: two blocks that are separated by two different roads would have two different borders? \n\n Let me re-read: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". The common border is the set of points that are on the road and separating the two blocks. However, two blocks are separated by one or more roads? Actually, the entire plane is divided by the arrangement of lines. Two blocks are adjacent if they share a common edge (a part of one road). \n\n Now, consider: to go from home to university, we need to cross every road that separates the two points. But note: a road may not necessarily separate the two points. For example, if the two points are on the same side of a road, then we don't need to cross it.\n\n How many roads separate the two points? That is, for each road, check which side the home and the university are on. If they are on opposite sides, then we must cross that road at least once.\n\n However, the problem asks for the minimum number of steps. In one step, we can cross one road? But wait: what if we cross two roads at the same time? \n\n Actually, when we cross two roads at the same time, we are moving from one block to another that is separated by two roads. But note: the common border between two blocks is a single road. Therefore, to cross two roads, we must do two steps.\n\n However, consider: we can cross multiple roads at the same step if the two blocks share a common border that is the union of several roads? The problem says: the common border must be a nonzero length. The roads are straight lines, and the common border between two blocks is one contiguous segment of one road (because the arrangement of lines divides the plane, and two blocks share at most one contiguous segment of a road).\n\n Therefore, each step corresponds to crossing one road. But note: we are allowed to cross one road at a time, so the minimum number",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a single road (line) that separates two adjacent blocks. The key insight is that each time we cross a road that separates the home and university, it counts as one step. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The home and university are located in different blocks separated by certain roads. Each road is an infinite line defined by the equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\). The movement between blocks is allowed only if they share a common border (segment of a road). The minimal steps required to reach the university from home is equal to the number of roads that separate the two points.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each road, check whether the home and university lie on opposite sides of the road. If they do, then crossing this road is necessary, and each such road contributes one step to the total.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves iterating over each road and determining the side of the home and university relative to the road. This is done by evaluating the sign of the expression \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) for both points. If the signs differ, the road separates the two points and must be crossed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    \n    n = int(data[4])\n    index = 5\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        index += 3\n        \n    count = 0\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        d1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        d2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if (d1 > 0 and d2 < 0) or (d1 < 0 and d2 > 0):\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the coordinates of the home and university, the number of roads, and the coefficients defining each road.\n2. **Checking Road Separation**: For each road, the code checks if the home and university lie on opposite sides of the road by evaluating the sign of the linear equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) for both points. If the signs differ, the road is counted as a separator.\n3. **Output Result**: The total count of such separating roads is printed, which represents the minimum number of steps needed to reach the university from home, as each step corresponds to crossing one road.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal steps by leveraging geometric properties of lines and points, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
