He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem:\n\n We are given two tokens in the first line: a and b. \n   - a is an integer base (2 <= a <= 25)\n   - b can be either an integer (same constraints) or the letter 'R'\n\n Then we are given a string c which is a non-negative integer in base a (with possible leading zeros, but length <= 1000). The number is guaranteed to be such that if b is 'R', then the number is at most 300010 and not zero.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Convert the given string `c` from base `a` to base 10 (integer).\n    - Since the string might have digits beyond 9 (if base > 10) then we'll use letters. However, note that the input for base a (and b) is between 2 and 25, so we might have bases up to 25. \n    - The digits in the string can be represented by characters. For base up to 25, we need digits up to 24. Typically, we use 0-9 and then A=10, B=11, ... up to O (since 10+14=24).\n\n 2. If b is an integer:\n      Convert the base-10 integer to base b (which is an integer between 2 and 25). \n      We must represent the base-b digits appropriately: for digits 0-9, use the digit character, for 10 and above, use letters starting from 'A' (so 10->'A', 11->'B', etc.). But note: the problem says that in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\n\n 3. If b is 'R':\n      Convert the base-10 integer to a Roman numeral (string). The problem states that the number is at most 300010 and not zero.\n      We need to follow the subtractive notation rules for Roman numerals.\n\n However, note: the example input \"16 R\\n5\" outputs \"V\", which is correct because 5 in base 10 is represented as 'V'.\n\n Important: The input number `c` is given in base `a`. So we must first convert it to base 10.\n\n Steps for conversion:\n\n  Step 1: Convert the string `c` from base `a` to base 10.\n\n    Example: \n        Input: \"10 2\\n1\" -> base 10 is 1, then base 2 is 1 -> output \"1\"\n        Input: \"16 R\\n5\" -> base 10 is 5, then convert 5 to Roman -> \"V\"\n\n    But note: the input \"5 R\\n4\": \n        The first part is base 5, the string is \"4\", so base 10 is 4, then convert to Roman: \"IV\"\n\n  How to convert from base a to base 10?\n\n    We can do:\n\n        num = 0\n        for each char in c (from left to right? Actually, the usual way is to process from the most significant to least, so we traverse the string from left to right, but note: the representation is positional.\n\n        Actually, the standard way is:\n\n            for i, digit in enumerate(c):\n                digit_value = int(digit) if digit in '0123456789' else (ord(digit) - ord('A') + 10)\n                but wait: the input string might be in base a, and a can be up to 25. Also, the string can contain digits that are represented by letters only if the base is greater than 10.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 1000.\"\n\n        And the digits used in base a are from 0 to a-1. The representation uses:\n          - For digits 0-9: the corresponding digit character\n          - For digits 10 to a-1: the letters from 'A' onward.\n\n        But note: the input string might have letters even if base a is <= 10? Actually, no: because the problem says \"integer number a\" and then the second part is either integer b or R. And the next line is a non-negative integer in base a. \n\n        However, the example input: \"12 13\\nA\" -> base 12, so the digit 'A' represents 10.\n\n        So the conversion from base a to base 10:\n\n            Let s = c (the string",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, which could either be a standard base or a Roman numeral system. The solution involves three main steps: converting the input number from its given base to base 10, then converting the base 10 number to the desired output base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input String to Base 10**: The input string is given in base `a`. Each character in the string represents a digit in base `a`. We process each character, converting it to its corresponding numerical value (0-9 for digits, A-Z for values 10 and above), and then compute the total value in base 10 by summing up each digit multiplied by `a` raised to the appropriate power.\n\n2. **Convert Base 10 to Output Base**: If the target base `b` is an integer, we convert the base 10 number to base `b` by repeatedly dividing the number by `b` and collecting remainders. These remainders are then mapped back to their respective characters (digits or letters) for bases higher than 10.\n\n3. **Convert Base 10 to Roman Numerals**: If the target base `b` is 'R', we convert the base 10 number to Roman numerals. This involves breaking down the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and units, and using predefined rules to combine the corresponding Roman numeral symbols. Special cases for subtractive notation (like IV for 4) are handled during this conversion.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    a_str = first_line[0]\n    b_str = first_line[1] if len(first_line) > 1 else 'R'\n    \n    c_str = data[1].strip()\n    \n    try:\n        a = int(a_str)\n    except:\n        print(\"Invalid input\")\n        return\n        \n    if b_str == 'R':\n        num_base10 = convert_base_a_to_base10(c_str, a)\n        roman_numeral = convert_to_roman(num_base10)\n        print(roman_numeral)\n    else:\n        try:\n            b = int(b_str)\n        except:\n            print(\"Invalid input\")\n            return\n            \n        if a < 2 or a > 25 or b < 2 or b > 25:\n            print(\"Bases must be between 2 and 25\")\n            return\n            \n        num_base10 = convert_base_a_to_base10(c_str, a)\n        result = convert_base10_to_base_b(num_base10, b)\n        print(result)\n\ndef convert_base_a_to_base10(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    length = len(s)\n    for i, char in enumerate(s):\n        digit_val = char_to_digit(char)\n        if digit_val >= base:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Invalid digit '{char}' in base {base}\")\n        num += digit_val * (base ** (length - i - 1))\n    return num\n\ndef char_to_digit(c):\n    if c in '0123456789':\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        return 10 + (ord(c) - ord('A'))\n\ndef convert_base10_to_base_b(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    \n    digits = []\n    while n:\n        n, r = divmod(n, base)\n        digits.append(digit_to_char(r))\n        \n    return ''.join(digits[::-1])\n\ndef digit_to_char(d):\n    if d < 10:\n        return str(d)\n    else:\n        return chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n\ndef convert_to_roman(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"\"\n    roman_map = [\n        ('M', 1000),\n        ('CM', 900), ('D', 500), ('CD', 400),\n        ('C', 100), ('XC', 90), ('L', 50), ('XL', 40),\n        ('X', 10), ('IX', 9), ('V', 5), ('IV', 4),\n        ('I', 1)\n    ]\n    roman = ''\n    for numeral, value in roman_map:\n        count = n // value\n        roman += numeral * count\n        n -= value * count\n    return roman\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line specifies the source and target bases, and the second line provides the number in the source base.\n2. **Base Conversion**: The function `convert_base_a_to_base10` processes each character of the input string, converts it to its numerical value, and accumulates the total value in base 10.\n3. **Output Conversion**: Depending on the target base:\n   - For standard bases, `convert_base10_to_base_b` repeatedly divides the base 10 number by the target base, collecting remainders which are then mapped to their respective characters.\n   - For Roman numerals, `convert_to_roman` breaks down the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and units, using predefined Roman numeral symbols and handling subtractive notation where necessary.\n4. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles invalid inputs, such as out-of-range bases or invalid digits, by raising errors and printing appropriate messages.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the conversion between different bases and Roman numerals, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
