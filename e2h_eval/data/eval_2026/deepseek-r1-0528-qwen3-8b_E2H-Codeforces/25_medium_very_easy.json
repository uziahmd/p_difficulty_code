При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string `t` and we need to check if it can be formed by taking two copies of some string `s` (with the same length) and then overlapping them at least once (but not completely, meaning the overlap must be positive and less than the entire message). However, note that the problem says: \n \"Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений.\" \n This means that if the entire second message is overlapped (so t is exactly s+s, but with an overlap of len(s)), then that is not considered an error. But wait, actually the example says:\n   Example: if we get \"abcd\", then no error. Similarly, if we get \"abcabc\", then no error.\n\n Actually, the problem states that the error happens when two identical messages are sent one after another and due to a fault they merge. The merging condition is that the end of the first matches the beginning of the second for at least one character and at most the entire length (exclusive? actually the problem says: \"the length of the overlap must be positive and less than the length of the text\". So the entire text (which is two copies of s) cannot have an overlap of the full length? Actually, note:\n\n In the example: \n   \"abrakadabra\" sent twice, and if merged with an overlap of 1, we get \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n   and with an overlap of 4, we get \"abrakadabrakadabra\"\n\n Also note: \n   If we send \"abrakadabra\" twice and the entire second one is overlapped (overlap of 11, which is the length of s), then the resulting string would be \"abrakadabra\" (because the entire second copy is overlapped and the first copy's last 11 characters match the second copy's first 11). But the problem says: \"the length of the overlap must be positive and less than the length of the text\" — wait, the text here is the two messages, so the total length is 2 * len(s). But the condition is about the overlap being positive and less than the length of the text? Or less than the length of the message (each message has length L, and the overlap must be between 1 and L-1)?\n\n Let me re-read: \"длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения\". \n\n Here, the \"текста сообщения\" — but note: the message is being transmitted as two copies. The problem says: \"два одинаковых сообщения\", and each message is s. The condition says: the overlap must be positive and less than the length of the text (of the message). \n\n Wait, the example says: \"меньшим длины текста сообщения\". But in the example, the two messages are \"abrakadabra\", so the text of the message is \"abrakadabra\", which has length 11. The example shows two cases: overlap 1 and 4, both less than 11. \n\n But note: the entire message is two copies. The problem says: \"the length of the overlap must be positive and less than the length of the text of the message\". So the text of the message (each individual message) has length L, and the overlap must be between 1 and L-1? \n\n Actually, the example also says: \"if you get 'abcd', then no error\" — that is, two messages 'ab' and 'cd'? Or two messages 'a' and 'bcd'? Wait, let me clarify:\n\n The problem states: \"when two identical messages are sent consecutively\", so the two messages are the same. Therefore, the entire string t should be composed of two copies of s, but with an overlap of k (1 <= k < len(s)).\n\n However, note the example input: \n   Input: 'abcabc' -> Output: 'NO'\n\n Why? Because if we break 'abcabc' into two parts, we can consider:\n   Option 1: s = 'abc', then without error we would have 'abcabc'. But the problem says that without error is just concatenation (no overlap). However, the error condition requires an overlap. So we must have an overlap. \n\n But wait, the problem says: \n   \"Analogically, simple concatenation (without overlap) is not considered an error. For example, if you get 'abcabc', then there was no error.\"\n\n However, note: the example input includes 'abcabc' and outputs 'NO'. \n\n But wait, the example output for input ['abcabc'] is 'NO'. \n\n However, the example input also includes:\n   'acacacaca' -> YES, and the output is 'acaca'\n\n How does that work?\n   t = 'acacacaca'\n   We need to split it into two strings: s1 and s2, but s1 and s2 must be the same string s, and then t = s1 + s2 with an overlap of k (1<=k<len(s)).\n\n But note: the problem says that the two messages are identical. So s1 = s2 = s.\n\n Now, how do we break 'acacacaca'? \n\n Let n = len(t) = 9.\n\n We are going to assume that t is formed by two copies of s, i.e., t = s + s[k:] (with an overlap of k, so the first part is s and the second part is s[k:]).\n\n Then the entire string t must satisfy: \n   t[0:L] = s\n   t[L:] = s[k:]\n\n Also, the total length is 2L - k, and we know k is from 1 to L-1.\n\n But note: the problem says that the error occurs only when two identical messages are sent. So the entire string t must be broken as:\n\n   t = s[0:L] + s[k: L]   [but wait, the second copy is s, so we are sending s and then s again, so the second copy starts at position L and we take the next (L - k) characters? Actually, the entire second copy is s, but we are overlapping k characters, so the second copy is effectively appended without the first k characters (because they are already provided by the overlap).\n\n Alternatively, we can think: \n   t = s + s[k:]\n\n Then the length of t is L + (L - k) = 2L - k.\n\n We are given t, so we can iterate over possible k (the overlap) and possible L (the length of s). But note: the entire string t must be built from two copies of s. So we can also consider that the entire string t must have a prefix s (of length L) and a suffix of length (L - k) that is equal to the substring of s starting at index k.\n\n But note: the second copy is the whole s, so the part we are appending is s[k:], and that must equal the substring of t starting at index L (which is at position L, and the total length is 2L-k). \n\n Alternatively, we can consider splitting the string t into two parts: \n   Let the two copies of s be s1 and s2 (each of length L). Then the condition for an error is that the last k characters of s1 equal the first k characters of s2. And the entire t is s1 + s2[k:].\n\n Then the total length of t is L + (L - k) = 2L - k.\n\n But note: the problem doesn't specify that the entire string t must be exactly two copies of s with an overlap. It says: \"determine if this message t might be the result of an error\". \n\n However, the problem also says: \n   \"If the message t does not contain an error, output NO.\"\n\n And an error occurs only when two identical messages are sent and then merged (with an overlap between 1 and L-1). \n\n But note: what if t was formed by two different ways? The problem says \"if possible\" then output \"YES\" and a possible s.\n\n Another way: the entire string t must be such that there exists an integer L (length of s) and an integer k (overlap, 1<=k<L) such that:\n\n   t[0:L] = s\n   t[L: L+L-k] = s[k:]   (but note: the length of t is L + (L-k) = 2L-k)\n\n But also, the entire string t must be exactly that.\n\n However, note: the two copies are the same s, so we must have:\n\n   t[0:L] = s\n   t[L: L+L-k] = s[k:]\n\n But also, the second copy is s, so the part t[L:] must be s[k:]. \n\n But wait, the entire string t has length 2L-k. Therefore, we have:\n\n   Condition 1: t[0:L] = s.\n   Condition 2: t[L: L+L-k] = s[k:].\n\n But note: s = t[0:L], so s[k:] is known. And the substring t[L: L+L-k] must equal s[k:].\n\n However, we don't know L. But note: the entire string t must be of the form: \n   t = s + s[k:]   => the length of t is 2L - k.\n\n Since k is at least 1 and at most L-1, the length of t must be between L+1 and 2L-1.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider: the entire string t must be periodic with period L, but with a shift.\n\n Actually, a simpler approach: \n   Let n = len(t)\n   We can try to see if t can be broken into two parts: \n        t = A + B, where A is the first copy of s and B is the second copy of s without the first k characters.\n\n   But note: the two copies are the same s, so the second copy is s, and we are dropping the first k characters because they overlap with the end of A.\n\n   Therefore, we must have:\n        A = s (of length L)\n        B = s[k:] (so the length of B is L - k)\n\n   And the entire string t is A + B, so the length is L + (L - k) = 2L - k.\n\n   Also, the last k characters of A must equal the first k characters of B? Actually, wait: the overlap condition is that the last k characters of the first copy (A) must equal the first k characters of the second copy (B). But note, the second copy is s, and the first copy is s, so the entire second copy is s, and we are only appending from the k-th character onward. The condition for the error is that the overlapping part (the last k of the first copy and the first k of the second copy) must be the same.\n\n   However, we don't have the second copy as a separate entity. We have t = s + s[k:].\n\n   But note: the entire string t must be consistent with having been formed by two copies of s. \n\n   We can also consider: the string t must be such that if we take two copies of s (so t = s+s) and then remove the first k characters from the second copy, we get t. But wait, that is the same as: t = s + s[k:].\n\n   However, note: the problem does not require that the entire second copy is present. It only requires that the two original messages were the same and that an error occurred (so the two copies merged with an overlap). \n\n   But how do we find s?\n\n   We can try to break the string t at every possible position for the boundary between the two copies, but note: the two copies are the same s. \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n   Let the entire string t be of length n.\n\n   We are going to assume that the two copies of s are of length L, and the overlap is k (so 1<=k<L). Then:\n\n        n = 2L - k   => L = (n + k) / 2\n\n   Since L must be an integer, then (n+k) must be even.\n\n   Also, k must be at least 1 and at most L-1.\n\n   Then we can express L in terms of n and k: L = (n+k)//2, and then we require that (n+k) is even and L > k (since k < L).\n\n   Then, we must have:\n\n        t[0:L] = s\n        t[L: L+(L-k)] = s[k:]   => but note: the length of the second part is L-k, and the substring we are comparing is from index L to index L+(L-k)-1, which is L + (L-k) - 1 = 2L - k - 1 = n - 1.\n\n   So the entire string t is covered.\n\n   However, we can also consider: the second copy is s, so the entire string t must be equal to s + s[k:].\n\n   Steps:\n\n   We are going to iterate over possible k (the overlap). But note: k can vary from 1 to floor((n-1)/2) because L = (n+k)//2 must be at least k+1, so (n+k) must be at least 2*(k+1) => n+k >= 2k+2 => n >= k+2. And k is at most L-1, and L = (n+k)//2, so k < (n+k)//2 => 2k < n+k => k < n. But we also have the condition that the entire string t is built from two copies of s.\n\n   Alternatively, we can iterate over the possible lengths L. Since the two copies are of length L, then the total length n must satisfy: n = 2L - k, and k in [1, L-1]. Therefore, n must be in [L+1, 2L-1]. \n\n   We can iterate L from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1? Actually, from the equation n = 2L - k, and k>=1, so L <= n-1 (because k>=1 => 2L-n>=1 => L >= (n+1)/2, and k<=L-1 => 2L-n <= L-1 => L <= n-1). \n\n   Actually, we can iterate over L from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1 (inclusive). Then, for a fixed L, we require that n = 2L - k, so k = 2L - n. Then we must have 1 <= k <= L-1.\n\n   Conditions for a fixed L:\n        k = 2L - n must be between 1 and L-1.\n\n   Then, we must check:\n        t[0:L] == t[n-L+1: n]   ??? \n\n   Wait, let's break down:\n\n        We have two copies: the first copy is s = t[0:L]\n        The second copy is s, but we only take from index k to the end. The entire string t is:\n            t = s + s[k:]\n        The second copy s[k:] is from index k to the end of s (which is of length L-k). \n\n        But note: the entire string t has length n = L + (L - k) = 2L - k.\n\n        Now, the second copy s[k:] must be equal to the substring of t starting at position L and of length L-k.\n\n        So: t[L: L + (L-k)] = s[k:]\n\n        But s = t[0:L], so s[k:] = t[k:L]\n\n        Therefore, we require: t[L: L + (L-k)] = t[k:L]\n\n        But note: the substring t[L: L+(L-k)] is of length L-k, and t[k:L] is of length L-k (from index k to L-1).\n\n        So we require: t[L: L+(L-k)] == t[k:L]\n\n   Example: t = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", n=21, and let L=11, then k=2*11-21=1. Then we require:\n        s = t[0:11] = \"abrakadabra\"\n        and t[11:11+(11-1)] = t[11:21] = \"brakadabra\" (but wait, the second copy s[k:] is s[1:] which is \"brakadabra\", and indeed t[11:21] is \"brakadabra\".\n\n   But wait, the example input also includes 'acacacaca' (n=9). \n\n        Possibilities for L: from ceil((9+1)/2)=5 to 8.\n\n        L=5: k=2*5-9=1 -> valid because 1<=1<=4 (L-1=4). Then check:\n            s = t[0:5] = \"acaca\"\n            then the second part should be s[1:] = \"acaca\"[1:] = \"caca\", and the substring t[5:5+4] = t[5:9] = \"caca\" -> matches.\n\n        So we found one.\n\n   However, note: the problem says that the entire string must be built from two copies of s. In this case, the two copies are \"acaca\" and \"acaca\", and the entire string is \"acacacaca\", which is \"acaca\" + \"caca\", and \"caca\" is the second copy without the first 1 character.\n\n   But wait, the entire second copy is \"acaca\", but we only took \"caca\". So the condition is met.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the two messages are identical. The second message is \"acaca\", but the part that we appended is \"caca\", which is the entire second message without the first character. That's acceptable.\n\n   Algorithm:\n\n   Steps:\n     1. Read the string t.\n     2. Let n = len(t)\n     3. Consider all possible L from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1 (both inclusive) such that k = 2*L - n is between 1 and L-1 (both inclusive).\n        But note: k must be an integer and we have defined k=2*L-n, so we require that 1 <= (2*L-n) <= L-1.\n\n        Conditions: \n          2*L - n >= 1   => L >= (n+1)/2   (which we are iterating from ceil((n+1)/2))\n          2*L - n <= L-1  => L <= n-1        (which is our upper bound)\n\n        So we can iterate L from max(ceil((n+1)/2), ? ) to n-1.\n\n        Actually, we can iterate L from floor((n+1)/2) to n-1, but note: we require that k=2*L-n is at least 1 and at most L-1.\n\n        Alternatively, we can iterate L from (n+1)//2 to n-1 (if n is odd, then (n+1)//2 is an integer; if even, then (n+1)//2 is a float, but we can use integer floor division and adjust).\n\n        Actually, we can set:\n            low_L = (n+1) // 2   [if n is even, then (n+1)//2 is (n//2) + (1//2) -> integer division truncates, so for even n: (n+1)//2 = (n+1)//2 (integer division) = n//2 + (1 if n is odd? no, integer division rounds down). \n\n        Example: n=9 -> (9+1)//2 = 10//2=5. n=10 -> (10+1)//2=11//2=5 (in integer division). But for n=10, we want L from 5 to 9.\n\n        Then, for each L in the range [low_L, n-1] (both inclusive) we check:\n            k = 2*L - n\n            if k < 1 or k > L-1: skip this L.\n            Then, we check if t[0:L] == t[L-k:L] ??? \n\n        Wait, let me clarify: we require that the second copy's part (s[k:]) is equal to the substring starting at L of length L-k.\n\n        But note: the entire string t is built as:\n            t = s + s[k:] \n        and s = t[0:L]\n\n        So we require: \n            t[L: L+(L-k)] == s[k:] = t[k:L]\n\n        But the length of t[L: L+(L-k)] is (L-k) and the length of t[k:L] is (L-k). So we compare two substrings of length (L-k):\n\n            substring1 = t[L: L+L-k]\n            substring2 = t[k: k+L-k] = t[k:L]\n\n        But note: k+L-k = L, so substring2 is t[k:L].\n\n        However, wait: the second copy is s, and we are only using the part from index k to the end (which is length L-k). \n\n        So the condition is: t[L: L+L-k] == t[k:L]\n\n        But note: the entire string t must be of length n = 2L - k. \n\n        Example with t=\"abcabc\": n=6.\n\n        Let's try L=3: then k=2*3-6=0 -> invalid (k must be at least 1). \n        L=4: then k=2*4-6=2 -> but 2 must be <= L-1=3 -> valid. Then we check:\n            s = t[0:4] = \"abcab\"\n            then the second copy's part is s[2:] = \"cab\", and the substring t[4:4+ (4-2)] = t[4:6] = \"bc\", which is not equal to \"cab\". \n\n        But wait, the entire string t is \"abcabc\", and if we break it as two copies of s of length 4, then the two copies are \"abcab\" and \"abcab\", and the overlap is 2, so the merged string would be \"abcab\" + \"cab\" = \"abcabcab\", which is longer than 6. \n\n        Actually, the condition is that the entire string t must be exactly s + s[k:], and the length is 2L-k. \n\n        For L=4, k=2, then the length is 2*4-2=6, which matches. But then the second part is s[k:] = s[2:] = \"cab\", and the substring t[4:4+2] (because L-k=2) is t[4:6] = \"bc\", which is not \"cab\".\n\n        So why did we get \"bc\"? \n\n        The entire string t is \"abcabc\". \n        We broke it as:\n            First copy: s = t[0:4] = \"abcab\"\n            Then the second copy is s[k:] = \"cab\", and we put that at position 4: so we have \"abcab\" and then \"cab\", making \"abcabcab\", which is 7 characters, but our t is 6. \n\n        There is a confusion: \n\n        The formula for the entire string is: \n            t = s + s[k:]   -> the length is L + (L-k) = 2L-k.\n\n        For L=4 and k=2, the length is 6, so the second part must be 6-4=2 characters? Actually, the second part is s[k:] which is of length L-k=2, so we take 2 characters from s: \"ca\" (if s=\"abcab\", then s[2:4] is \"ca\")? \n\n        Actually, in Python, slicing: \n            s = \"abcab\", k=2 -> s[k:] is from index 2 to the end: \"cab\", which is 3 characters. \n\n        But wait, the length of s[k:] is L - k = 4-2=2? No, in Python, s[k:] is from index k to the end, so the length is L - k (because indices from k to L-1, so L-k elements). \n\n        Example: s = \"abcab\", k=2 -> s[2:] is \"cab\", which is 3 characters. But 4-2=2, so that doesn't match.\n\n        Actually, the length of s[k:] is L - k (if we consider the string is 0-indexed and has length L). \n\n        Let me count: \n            s = \"abcab\": \n                index0: 'a'\n                index1: 'b'\n                index2: 'c'\n                index3: 'a'\n                index4: 'b' -> wait, no, \"abcab\" has 5 characters? \n\n        I made a mistake: the length L is the length of s, so if we take s = t[0:L] and t has length n, then for L=4, s is the first 4 characters: \"abca\" (if t=\"abcabc\", then first 4: \"abca\"). \n\n        Then s[2:] is \"ca\", which is 2 characters.\n\n        But wait, the example t=\"abcabc\", n=6, and we are trying L=4. Then s = t[0:4] = \"abca\", and the second part is s[2:] = \"ca\", so the entire string would be \"abca\"+\"ca\" = \"abca ca\" (without space) -> \"abcaca\", which is 6 characters. \n\n        But our t is \"abcabc\", not \"abcaca\". \n\n        So we require: \n            t[0:4] + t[2:4] = \"abca\" + \"ca\" = \"abcaca\", which is not \"abcabc\".\n\n        Therefore, for L=4, we require that the substring from index 4 to 6 is \"ca\", but in \"abcabc\", the substring from index4 is \"bc\".\n\n        So condition fails.\n\n        What about L=3? Then k=0, which is invalid.\n\n        What about L=5? Then k=2*5-6=4, but k must be <= L-1=4 -> valid. Then s = t[0:5]=\"abcab\", and the second part is s[4:]=\"b\", so the entire string is \"abcab\"+\"b\" = \"abcabb\", which is 6 characters? \n            Actually, the length is 5 + (5-4)=6, so we have \"abcab\" + \"b\" (which is 5+1=6). Then we compare the substring t[5:5+(5-4)] = t[5:6] = \"c\", but the second part is \"b\", so not equal.\n\n        So no L works.\n\n        Therefore, output \"NO\", which matches the example.\n\n   However, note: the example input also includes \"abababab\" (n=8). \n\n        We are told the output should be \"YES\\nababab\"\n\n        Let's check: \n            t = \"abababab\"\n\n        We need to find L and k such that:\n            n=8, so L from ceil((8+1)/2)=ceil(9/2)=5 to 7.\n\n        Try L=5: k=2*5-8=2 -> valid (1<=2<=4). Then s = t[0:5]=\"ababa\", and the second part is s[2:]=\"aba\", so the entire string would be \"ababa\"+\"aba\" = \"ababaaba\", but our t is \"abababab\", so that doesn't match.\n\n        Try L=6: k=2*6-8=4 -> valid (1<=4<=5). Then s = t[0:6]=\"ababab\", and the second part is s[4:]=\"ab\", so the entire string is \"ababab\"+\"ab\" = \"abababab\", which is exactly t.\n\n        Now, check: \n            t[0:6] = \"ababab\"\n            t[6:6+(6-4)] = t[6:8] = \"ab\", and s[4:6] = \"ab\", so they match.\n\n        Therefore, s=\"ababab\", and we output \"YES\\nababab\".\n\n   But wait, the example output is \"YES\\nababab\", but note: the problem says if there are multiple possibilities, output any. \n\n   However, note: the problem says \"output the string s\", and s is the original message (the two copies of s). \n\n   But note: the entire string t is built from two copies of s, so the two messages were both s. \n\n   Therefore, we can output s = t[0:L] = \"ababab\".\n\n   But wait, is there a shorter s? The problem doesn't require the minimal s, just any s that could lead to the error.\n\n   However, note: the two copies must be the same, and the entire string is built by two copies of s. \n\n   But what if we take a longer s? Actually, the length L is determined by the equation and the condition.\n\n   There's one more possibility: sometimes the same t might be explained by different s? \n\n   However, the problem says \"if possible, determine a possible value of s\".\n\n   So algorithm:\n\n        n = len(t)\n        # We'll iterate L from (n+1)//2 to n-1 (inclusive)\n        found = False\n        candidate_s = None\n\n        for L in range((n+1)//2, n):\n            k = 2*L - n\n            if k < 1 or k > L-1:\n                continue\n\n            # Check if the two parts match\n            # The first copy is s = t[0:L]\n            # The second part of the string is t[L: L+L-k] (which has length L-k) and must equal t[k:L] (which is the second copy without the first k characters)\n\n            # But note: the entire string t is of length n, so the second part we are comparing is from index L to index n-1 (because n = 2L-k, so L+L-k = 2L-k = n). \n            # Therefore, the substring t[L: n] must equal t[k:L].\n\n            if t[L:] == t[k:L]:\n                # But wait, the length of t[L:] is n - L, and the length of t[k:L] is L - k.\n                # And we have n = 2L - k, so n-L = L-k, so the lengths match.\n\n                # However, we must compare t[L: L+(L-k)] and t[k:L]. But note: the entire string t is of length n, so the second part is from index L to the end, which is exactly L-k characters? \n                # Actually, the length of t[L:] is n - L = (2L-k) - L = L-k, so yes.\n\n                # But note: we can write the condition as:\n                #   t[L:] == t[k:L]\n\n                # But wait: t[L:] is from index L to the end (n-1) and t[k:L] is from index k to L-1. \n\n                # Example with t=\"abababab\", L=6, k=4:\n                #   t[6:] = \"ab\" (from index6 to index7)\n                #   t[4:6] = \"ab\" (from index4 to index5)\n\n                # They are the same.\n\n                candidate_s = t[:L]\n                found = True\n                break\n\n        If found: \n            print(\"YES\")\n            print(candidate_s)\n        Else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, wait: the example input \"acacacaca\" (n=9) was found with L=5, k=1, and then we checked t[5:] == t[1:5]? \n        t[5:] = \"caca\" (from index5 to the end: \"caca\")\n        t[1:5] = \"cac\" -> wait, no: from index1 to index4 (exclusive of 5) is \"cac\" (if t=\"acacacaca\", then indices: \n            t[0]='a', t[1]='c', t[2]='a', t[3]='c', t[4]='a', t[5]='c', t[6]='a', t[7]='c', t[8]='a'\n        Then t[1:5] = \"caca\" from index1 to index4? Actually, in Python, slicing [1:5] gives characters at positions 1,2,3,4 (exclusive of 5). \n        So for t=\"acacacaca\":\n            t[5:] = t[5:9] = \"caca\"\n            t[1:5] = t[1] to t[4] = \"caca\" (because: \n                index1: 'c'\n                index2: 'a'\n                index3: 'c'\n                index4: 'a' -> wait, that is \"c a c a\" -> \"caca\"\n\n        So the condition holds.\n\n   But wait, in the condition we wrote: \n        if t[L:] == t[k:L]:\n\n   In the example, k=1, L=5, so t[k:L] = t[1:5] = \"caca\", and t[L:] = t[5:9] = \"caca\", so they are equal.\n\n   However, note: the condition above uses t[k:L] (which is from index k to L-1) and t[L:] (from index L to the end). \n\n   But wait, in the example, the second copy is s, and the part we are appending is s[k:], which is from index k to the end of s (which is of length L). \n\n   In our representation, s = t[0:L], so s[k:] = t[k:L] (because s is t[0:L]). \n\n   And the entire string t is built as: \n        t = s + s[k:] \n        = t[0:L] + t[k:L] \n\n   But note: the length of t is L + (L-k) = 2L-k, so we must have:\n\n        t[0:L] + t[k:L] = t\n\n   This implies that the entire string t must be the concatenation of t[0:L] and t[k:L]. \n\n   But note: the first part is t[0:L] and the second part is t[k:L]. \n\n   However, the second part t[k:L] is contained in the first part (because k>=1 and L>k). \n\n   Then, the entire string t must satisfy:\n\n        For i in [0, L-1]: t[i] = t[i]   (first part)\n        For i in [L, L+L-k-1]: t[i] = t[i-L+k]   ?\n\n   Alternatively, we can check by building the string from the two parts: \n\n        candidate_string = t[:L] + t[k:L]\n\n        Then we require candidate_string == t.\n\n   But note: the length of candidate_string is L + (L-k) = 2L-k = n, so they have the same length.\n\n   So we can also check: candidate_string == t.\n\n   However, the two conditions are equivalent? \n\n        Condition 1: t[L:] == t[k:L]   [we are comparing the tail of t (from L to the end) to the substring of the first copy (from k to the end of the first copy)]\n\n        Condition 2: t = t[:L] + t[k:L]\n\n        Actually, Condition 2 is stronger: it says that the entire string t is the concatenation of the first L characters and the substring from k to L.\n\n        But note: the entire string t is of length n, and the concatenation of two parts (first L and then from k to L) has length L + (L-k) = 2L-k = n, so the entire string is built.\n\n        However, Condition 1 (t[L:] == t[k:L]) is necessary and sufficient for Condition 2? \n\n        Condition 2: t = t[:L] + t[k:L]\n\n        Then, the part from index L to the end (t[L:]) must be equal to t[k:L] (because the second part is t[k:L]).\n\n        So Condition 1 is actually the same as Condition 2? \n\n        Let me break Condition 2:\n\n            t[0:L] + t[k:L] = t\n\n            This means:\n                For indices 0 to L-1: t[i] = t[i] (trivially)\n                For indices L to L+(L-k)-1: t[i] = t[k + (i-L)]\n\n            But note: the substring t[k:L] is of length L-k, and we are putting it at position L.\n\n            Then, the entire string t is built by the two parts.\n\n        Condition 1: t[L:] == t[k:L] is the same as saying the tail of t (from L to the end) is exactly the substring from k to the end of the first copy.\n\n        And since the entire string t is built from two copies, the tail of t (from L to the end) must be the same as the second copy's part (which is s[k:]).\n\n       ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have been formed by concatenating two identical strings `s` with an overlap of at least one character but less than the length of `s`. The solution involves checking all possible lengths of `s` that could produce `t` through such an overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the string `t` must be formed by taking two copies of a string `s` and overlapping them such that the end of the first copy matches the beginning of the second copy for at least one character but less than the entire length of `s`. The total length of `t` will be `2L - k`, where `L` is the length of `s` and `k` is the overlap length (1 ≤ k < L).\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each possible length `L` of `s`, we can derive the overlap length `k` as `2L - n`, where `n` is the length of `t`. We then check if `k` is within the valid range (1 ≤ k < L). If so, we verify if the string `t` can be split into two parts: the first part being `s` (of length `L`) and the second part being `s[k:]` (the remaining part of `s` after the overlap). The entire string `t` should then be the concatenation of these two parts.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate over all possible lengths `L` from `(n + 1) // 2` to `n - 1`. For each `L`, compute `k = 2L - n`. If `k` is within the valid range, check if `t[0:L] + t[k:L]` equals `t`. If it does, `s` is found.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks each possible `L` in O(n) time per check (due to string slicing and comparison), leading to an overall time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case. Given the constraint `n ≤ 100`, this approach is efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    t = input().strip()\n    n = len(t)\n    found = False\n    candidate_s = None\n\n    for L in range((n + 1) // 2, n):\n        k = 2 * L - n\n        if k < 1 or k >= L:\n            continue\n            \n        if t[:L] + t[k:L] == t:\n            candidate_s = t[:L]\n            found = True\n            break\n\n    print(\"NO\") if not found else print(f\"YES\\n{candidate_s}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string `t` is read and its length `n` is determined.\n2. **Iteration Over Possible Lengths**: The loop runs from `(n + 1) // 2` to `n - 1` to consider all feasible lengths `L` for `s`.\n3. **Overlap Calculation**: For each `L`, the overlap length `k` is calculated as `2L - n`. If `k` is not within the valid range (1 ≤ k < L), the loop continues.\n4. **String Validation**: The code checks if `t` can be formed by concatenating `t[0:L]` and `t[k:L]`. If successful, `s` is set to `t[0:L]`, and the loop breaks.\n5. **Output Result**: If no valid `s` is found, it prints \"NO\". Otherwise, it prints \"YES\" followed by the candidate `s`.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways `t` could result from merging two identical strings with a valid overlap, ensuring correctness while adhering to the problem constraints.",
