For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes. The notes are from the set: ['C','C#','D','D#','E','F','F#','G','G#','A','B','H'] (12 notes)\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (0 to 11) representing its position in the 12-note cycle.\n 2. Since the chord is unordered, we need to consider all permutations of the three notes and check for the two patterns:\n    Pattern for major: [4, 3, 5] semitones? Actually, the definition says: \n        Major: order such that distance between X and Y is 4, and between Y and Z is 3 -> total from X to Z is 7.\n        Minor: order such that distance between X and Y is 3, and between Y and Z is 4 -> total from X to Z is 7.\n\n    But note: the entire circle has 12 semitones, so when we compute the distance between two notes, we can have two directions?\n    However, the problem states: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we don't wrap around arbitrarily?\n\n    But wait: the example says between E and C is 8 semitones (because E to F is 1, F to F# is 2, F# to G is 3, G to G# is 4, G# to A is 5, A to A# (which is B) is 6, B to C is 7, but wait: actually from E to C: \n        E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B, C -> that's 7 steps? But the example says 8.\n\n    Let me recount the example: \n        Example: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\"\n\n    Why 8? Because the problem states: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". So if we are going from E to C, we must go upward until we get to the next C? \n\n    Actually, the problem says: \"the distance between C and E is 4 semitones\" (which is correct: C->C# (1), C#->D (2), D->D# (3), D#->E (4)), and then from E to C: \n        E->F (1), F->F# (2), F#->G (3), G->G# (4), G#->A (5), A->A# (6), A#->B (7), B->C (8). So that's 8.\n\n    Therefore, the distance is defined as the number of semitones from the lower note to the higher note without wrapping? But then if we have two notes, we might have two possibilities: the direct way and the wrap-around way. However, the problem says \"from the lowest to the highest\", so we are always taking the positive direction (without wrapping) in the cyclic scale? \n\n    But wait: the scale is cyclic. How do we define the distance between two notes? The problem says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". This implies that we consider the circular scale, but the distance is the smallest non-negative steps? \n\n    However, the example from E to C is 8, which is more than half the circle (12/2=6). So they are not taking the minimal distance. They are taking the distance along the circle in the increasing direction (i.e., always moving forward, not backward). \n\n    But note: the definition of a major/minor chord requires the distances to be 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). These are less than 6, so they are the minimal distances? Actually, no: because if we take the minimal distance, then from E to C would be min(8, 12-8)=4. But the chord definition does not use minimal distance, it uses the actual distance from the lower to the higher.\n\n    However, the problem states: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\", meaning that we are allowed to reorder the three notes arbitrarily. But the ordering must be such that the distances are measured from the lower to the higher (so we are not wrapping around the circle arbitrarily). \n\n    But note: in a chord, the notes are considered in the same octave? Or across octaves? The problem says: \"the notes are repeated cyclically\", and we identify similar notes (like C and the next C). \n\n    Clarification: the distance between two notes is computed by considering the circle and the direction from the lower note to the higher note (in the positive direction). However, we are allowed to choose any starting point and then the next two, but the entire set must form an increasing sequence without wrapping? Actually, the chord definition does not specify octaves, but the problem says the notes are repeated cyclically and we identify similar ones. \n\n    Important: the input notes are given without octave information, so we assume they are from the same base octave? Or we can consider the circle and the relative positions.\n\n    Approach:\n\n    Let's assign numbers to the notes (0 to 11). Then, we can consider the three notes as three points on a circle of 12. We can break the circle and consider linear ordering by duplicating the circle? Or we can consider the distances in the circle.\n\n    However, the problem states: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\". So we are to compute the distance as (note2 - note1) mod 12, but if negative we add 12? Actually, the example E to C: \n        E is 4 (if C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, B=10, H=11? Wait, wait: the problem lists the notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n    Let me map:\n        C -> 0\n        C# -> 1\n        D -> 2\n        D# -> 3\n        E -> 4\n        F -> 5\n        F# -> 6\n        G -> 7\n        G# -> 8\n        A -> 9\n        B -> 10\n        H -> 11\n\n    Then, the distance from E (4) to C (0): \n        If we go forward: 0 - 4 = -4, but then we add 12: 8. That matches.\n\n    So the distance from note a to note b (without considering minimal, but the positive direction) is: (b - a) % 12, but if negative we add 12 until positive? Actually, the distance from a to b in the positive direction is (b - a) mod 12, but if (b - a) is negative, we can do (b - a + 12) % 12. However, note that (b - a) mod 12 might be negative. Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n        d = (b - a) % 12   # but if b < a, then (b - a) is negative, so we add 12 until positive: \n        Actually, we want the positive distance: (b - a) mod 12, but if negative, we add 12 and then mod 12? \n\n    But wait: the example says E to C is 8, and (0 - 4) % 12 = -4 % 12 = 8 (in Python, negative modulo gives a positive result). So we can compute:\n\n        distance(a, b) = (b - a) % 12   if (b - a) % 12 != 0? Actually, wait: \n        (0 - 4) % 12 = (-4) % 12 = 8, which is correct.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"the distance between two consecutive notes is 1 semitone\", and we are measuring the entire span from a to b. So the distance from a to b is the number of semitones from a to b, going forward (even if it goes through multiple octaves, but since we are in a circle of 12, we only need to go one octave). \n\n    But note: the chord definition requires three notes. We are allowed to order the three notes arbitrarily. However, the ordering must be such that the entire chord is contained in the circle without breaking the cyclic order? Actually, the problem does not specify octaves, so we assume the three notes are within one octave or we can wrap the circle arbitrarily? \n\n    But wait: the example \"C# B F\": ordered as \"B C# F\". \n        Let's map: \n            B -> 10, C# -> 1, F -> 5.\n\n        Now, we must order these three in the circle. The problem says: \"if we can order the notes so as the distance between B and C# is 3 semitones and between C# and F is 4 semitones\".\n\n        From B to C#: \n            B is 10, C# is 1. \n            (1 - 10) % 12 = (1 - 10) = -9, then mod 12: 3 (since -9 + 12 = 3). So that's 3 semitones.\n\n        From C# to F: \n            (5 - 1) % 12 = 4, which is 4 semitones.\n\n        So the ordering is B, C#, F (which is the same as the example). But note: in the linear scale, B is the highest? Actually, in the circle, we can also consider the ordering without wrapping. The problem says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", so we must have an increasing sequence.\n\n        In this case, if we start at B (10) and then go to C# (1) and then to F (5): \n            From B to C#: we went from 10 to 1, which is 3 semitones (going forward: 10->11 (H) and then 0 (C) and then 1 (C#)? But wait, that would be 3 steps: 10->11 (1 step), 11->0 (2nd step, but note: 0 is the next octave? Actually, the problem doesn't specify octaves, so we are just working modulo 12.\n\n        However, the problem says the notes are repeated cyclically and we identify similar ones. So we are working modulo 12.\n\n    Therefore, the plan is:\n\n    Step 1: Map the input notes to their numerical values (0 to 11).\n\n    Step 2: Generate all permutations of the three notes (each permutation being a candidate ordering).\n\n    Step 3: For a permutation (a, b, c):\n        d1 = (b - a) % 12   [This gives the distance from a to b in the positive direction, which might be more than 6? But note: the chord definition uses 4 and 3, so the total span from a to c is 7, which is less than 12, so we don't have to worry about multiple wraps?]\n\n        However, the problem says: \"the distance between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z equals 3 semitones\" for major. But note: the entire chord must be contained in a span of 7 semitones? Because from X to Z is 7. And 7 < 12, so we are safe.\n\n        But wait: what if the chord spans more than 7? Then we might have to consider wrapping? Actually, the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we are not allowed to wrap? Or we are allowed to consider the entire circle? \n\n        Let me read again: \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". \n\n        This suggests that we are only considering the linear progression from the lowest note to the highest note, and if we have a chord that wraps around the circle, then we would break the circle and consider the linear part from the lowest to the highest without wrapping? \n\n        However, the example \"C# B F\" was ordered as \"B C# F\", which in numbers is [10, 1, 5]. The distance from 10 to 1 is 3 (as calculated) and from 1 to 5 is 4. But note: if we break the circle, the note B (10) is the highest, then C# (1) is the next (lowest) and then F (5) is the next. This is actually the same as having the notes in the circle: ... , 10 (B), then 11 (H), then 0 (C), 1 (C#)... so the ordering B, C#, F is increasing in the circle? \n\n        Actually, the circle is: ... 10 (B), 11 (H), 0 (C), 1 (C#)... so the next after B is H (11) and then C (0). But the note C# is 1, which is after C (0). So the ordering in the circle is: B (10), then H (11), then C (0), then C# (1), then D (2)... So from B to C#: we skipped H and then C? Actually, the distance from B to C# is 3 semitones, meaning we count: \n            B (10) -> H (11): 1 semitone\n            H (11) -> C (0): 2 semitones? But wait, that's two steps, and then C (0) to C# (1): 3 semitones. So the distance from B to C# is 3 semitones.\n\n        Similarly, from C# (1) to F (5): \n            C# (1) -> D (2): 1\n            D (2) -> D# (3): 2\n            D# (3) -> E (4): 3\n            E (4) -> F (5): 4\n\n        So yes, 4 semitones.\n\n        Therefore, the distance computation (using modulo 12) is correct.\n\n    Step 4: Check the three permutations:\n\n        For a permutation (a, b, c):\n            d1 = (b - a) % 12   -> but wait, if (b - a) is negative, we get a positive number by adding 12. However, the problem says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", so if a is higher than b, then we should have a distance of (b + 12 - a) % 12? Actually, no: because we are allowed to wrap? The problem does not say we break the circle. \n\n        But note: the example does not break the circle. The chord \"C# B F\" is considered as [10, 1, 5] and the distances are computed without breaking the circle? Actually, the circle is continuous, so we are just using the modulo arithmetic.\n\n        However, there's a catch: the definition of the chord requires that the entire set of three notes is contained in the span of the ordering. But the problem does not require that the three notes are consecutive in the circle without wrapping? \n\n        Actually, the chord definition says: \"an unordered set of no less than three notes\", and then defines major and minor by the distances in a particular order. \n\n        The key: we are allowed to order the notes arbitrarily. So we can pick any starting note and then the next two, and the distances must be 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). \n\n        But note: the entire chord must be contained in a contiguous segment of the circle of length 7? Because the major chord has 4 and 3, so 4+3=7. Similarly, minor is 3+4=7. \n\n        However, if the chord spans more than 7, then we cannot form a major or minor? \n\n        But wait: the circle has 12 notes, and we are only using three. The maximum span (in the positive direction) for three distinct notes is 11 (if we take three consecutive notes, the span is 2; but if we take three notes that are apart by 11, then the minimal distance might be small). \n\n        Actually, the condition for a major/minor chord is that the three notes form a contiguous segment of 7 semitones? Not exactly: the entire set of three notes must lie in a segment of 7 semitones? \n\n        Let me think: in a major chord, the intervals are 4 and 3. The entire chord spans 7 semitones. Similarly, minor also spans 7. \n\n        But note: the circle has 12 semitones. There are two ways to have a chord of 7 semitones: either the chord is contained in a segment of 7, or we can also consider the complement? Actually, the chord is defined by the intervals, not the absolute positions. \n\n        However, the definition uses the distances from the lower to the higher. So we are effectively breaking the circle and making the three notes appear in a linear sequence? \n\n        But wait: the example \"C# B F\": the three notes are [10, 1, 5]. The entire set: the minimal span that covers all three is from 1 to 10, which is 9 semitones (because from 1 to 10: (10-1)=9, but wait, 10 is higher than 1? No, in the circle, 10 (B) is higher than 1 (C#) if we break at 0? Actually, we can break the circle between 0 and 12. \n\n        However, the problem's example orders the notes as B, C#, F, meaning they are increasing in the circle? \n\n        How do we determine the increasing order? The problem says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". So we must assign an order: the lowest note is the smallest one in the circle? But wait, in the circle, the notes are cyclic. \n\n        Actually, we can break the circle at any point. The problem does not specify. \n\n        Alternative approach: \n\n        Since the chord must have three distinct notes, we can consider the three notes and the two possible directions (clockwise and counterclockwise) to form the chord. But the problem says the distance is taken from the lowest to the highest, so we are always going clockwise (positive direction) from the lowest note.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        We have three notes: n1, n2, n3 (each in 0..11)\n\n        We can consider the three notes and sort them in the circle. However, we can also consider the following: \n\n        Let the three notes be x, y, z. We can consider the gaps between them. But note: the chord is defined by the two intervals.\n\n        Actually, we are allowed to choose any starting point. So we can consider the three possible starting points and then check the two following intervals.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the chord is an unordered set, and we can order arbitrarily. But the ordering must be such that the distances are 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). \n\n        We can do:\n\n        For each permutation of the three notes (there are 6):\n\n            Let the permutation be [a, b, c]\n\n            Then, check:\n                d1 = (b - a) % 12   [This is the distance from a to b]\n                d2 = (c - b) % 12   [This is the distance from b to c]\n                d3 = (c - a) % 12   [This is the distance from a to c, which should be (d1+d2) % 12? But note: (c-a) % 12 might not be (d1+d2) because of the circle? Actually, (c - a) = (c-b) + (b-a) mod 12? \n\n            But note: (c - a) % 12 = ( (c-b) + (b-a) ) % 12? Yes, because modulo addition.\n\n            Now, the condition for major is: there exists an ordering such that d1 = 4 and d2 = 3, and then d3 = 7.\n\n            Similarly, for minor: d1 = 3 and d2 = 4, then d3 = 7.\n\n        However, wait: what if the chord is not contained in a span of 7? Then d3 would be 7, but the two intervals are 4 and 3? Actually, the condition for major is that the two consecutive intervals are 4 and 3. \n\n        But note: the entire chord must be contained in the span from a to c, which is 7. So if we have a major chord, then the three notes are a, a+4, a+7 (mod 12). Similarly for minor: a, a+3, a+7.\n\n        However, there's a problem: the circle has 12 semitones, and 7 is less than 12, so we don't wrap. But what if the chord wraps? For example, if we have a chord that is a major chord but the last note is in the next octave? \n\n        Actually, the problem says the notes are repeated cyclically and we identify similar ones, so we are working modulo 12.\n\n        But note: the example \"C E G\": \n            C=0, E=4, G=7.\n            d1 = (4-0)%12 = 4, d2=(7-4)%12=3 -> major.\n\n        Another example: a minor chord: \"D F A\"?\n            D=2, F=5, A=9.\n            d1=(5-2)=3, d2=(9-5)=4 -> minor.\n\n        But wait: the example input includes \"A B H\": \n            A=9, B=10, H=11.\n            Let's check: \n                Permutation: [9,10,11]: \n                    d1=(10-9)=1, d2=(11-10)=1 -> not 3 or 4.\n                Permutation: [9,10,11] in different orders? Actually, we must consider all 6 permutations.\n\n            What if we break the circle? \n\n            Consider the chord \"A B H\": \n                We can also consider the ordering that wraps: \n                    Start at H (11), then A (9) -> wait, that's negative: (9-11)%12 = (9-11+12)%12 = 10. Then from A to B: (10-9)%12=1. \n                Or: H, B, A: \n                    (B - H) = (10-11)%12 = 11, (A-B)= (9-10)%12=11 -> not.\n\n            Alternatively, we can consider the gaps between the notes. The three notes are 9,10,11. The gaps are: \n                from 9 to 10: 1\n                from 10 to 11: 1\n                from 11 to 9: (9-11+12)%12 = 10.\n\n            So the chord is not major nor minor.\n\n        Therefore, we'll check all 6 permutations.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n        mapping = {'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11}\n\n        Read the input string, split into three tokens.\n\n        Convert each token to a number.\n\n        Generate all 6 permutations of the three numbers.\n\n        For each permutation (a,b,c):\n            d1 = (b - a) % 12   [if negative, modulo makes it positive]\n            d2 = (c - b) % 12\n            d3 = (c - a) % 12   # should be (d1+d2) % 12, but we don't need d3 for the condition, but we know d3 must be 7.\n\n            Conditions:\n                if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3: then this is a major chord (if we haven't found one already)\n                if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4: then this is a minor chord\n\n        But note: the entire chord must be contained in the segment of 7? The condition d1=4 and d2=3 implies d3=7, and similarly for minor.\n\n        However, what if the chord is major but the distances are not 4 and 3 in the order we are checking? We are checking every permutation.\n\n        But note: the definition requires that we can order the notes so that the first two have distance 4 and the next two (second and third) have 3. So we are checking every ordering.\n\n        Important: the problem says the answer is unambiguous (no chord is both major and minor).\n\n        So we can do:\n\n        found_major = False\n        found_minor = False\n\n        for perm in permutations([a,b,c]):\n            d1 = (perm[1] - perm[0]) % 12\n            d2 = (perm[2] - perm[1]) % 12\n            # We don't need d3 for the pattern, but we know that the entire span is d1+d2, and for major/minor it must be 7.\n\n            # However, note: the modulo operation for d1 and d2 might give numbers that are not the minimal distance? But the problem uses the positive direction.\n\n            if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                found_major = True\n            if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n                found_minor = True\n\n        Then, if found_major: print \"major\"\n        elif found_minor: print \"minor\"\n        else: print \"strange\"\n\n        Let me test with the examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"C E G\" -> [0,4,7]\n            Permutation [0,4,7]:\n                d1 = (4-0)%12=4, d2=(7-4)%12=3 -> major found.\n\n        Example 2: \"C# B F\" -> [1,10,5]\n            We need to find the permutation that gives [10,1,5] (or similar). Actually, we have the three numbers: 1,10,5.\n\n            Let's generate all permutations and check:\n\n            [1,10,5]: \n                d1 = (10-1)%12=9 -> not 3 or 4.\n                d2 = (5-10)%12= (5-10+12)%12=7 -> not 3 or 4.\n\n            [1,5,10]:\n                d1=(5-1)=4, d2=(10-5)=5 -> no.\n\n            [10,1,5]:\n                d1=(1-10)%12 = (1-10+12)%12=3, d2=(5-1)%12=4 -> minor found.\n\n            [10,5,1]:\n                d1=(5-10)%12= (5-10+12)%12=7, d2=(1-5)%12= (1-5+12)%12=8 -> no.\n\n            [5,1,10]:\n                d1=(1-5)%12= (1-5+12)%12=8, d2=(10-1)%12=9 -> no.\n\n            [5,10,1]:\n                d1=(10-5)=5, d2=(1-10)%12=3 -> no.\n\n            So we found minor.\n\n        Example 3: \"A B H\" -> [9,10,11]\n            Check all permutations:\n\n            [9,10,11]: d1=1, d2=1 -> no.\n            [9,11,10]: d1=(11-9)=2, d2=(10-11)%12= (10-11+12)=11 -> no.\n            [10,9,11]: d1=(9-10)%12= (9-10+12)=11, d2=(11-9)=2 -> no.\n            [10,11,9]: d1=(11-10)=1, d2=(9-11)%12= (9-11+12)=10 -> no.\n            [11,9,10]: d1=(9-11)%12= (9-11+12)=10, d2=(10-9)=1 -> no.\n            [11,10,9]: d1=(10-11)%12= (10-11+12)=11, d2=(9-10)%12= (9-10+12)=11 -> no.\n\n            So strange.\n\n        However, wait: the example input is given as \"A B H\", and the example output is \"strange\". So it works.\n\n        But wait: what if the chord is major but the distances are 4 and 3, but the entire chord spans more than 7? Actually, the condition d1=4 and d2=3 implies the entire chord from a to c is 7, which is less than 12. Similarly, minor is 7. \n\n        However, what if the chord is major but the three notes are not consecutive in the positive direction? For example, if we have a major chord that is an inversion? \n\n        Example: E, G, C (which is the same as C, E, G but inverted). \n            Notes: C=0, E=4, G=7.\n\n            Inversion: [E, G, C] -> [4,7,0]:\n                d1=(7-4)=3, d2=(0-7)%12= (0-7+12)=5 -> no.\n\n            Another inversion: [G, C, E] -> [7,0,4]:\n                d1=(0-7)%12=5, d2=(4-0)=4 -> no.\n\n        So the inversion is not found by our method. But wait: the problem says \"If we can order the notes so as the distance between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z equals 3 semitones\".\n\n        In the inversion [E, G, C] we cannot get 4 and 3? \n\n        Let me try to order [E, G, C] as [C, E, G] (which we did and found major). But the problem says \"unordered set\", so we can reorder arbitrarily. \n\n        However, the inversion [E, G, C] is the same set as [C, E, G]. So we must find the major pattern in one of the permutations.\n\n        Our method checks all permutations, so we must have one permutation that is [C, E, G] (or any order that gives the major pattern). \n\n        But in the inversion [E, G, C], we don't have a permutation that gives [C, E, G] because we are generating all permutations from the set {E, G, C}. \n\n        Actually, the set {E, G, C} is the same as {C, E, G}. So when we generate permutations, we will get [E, G, C] and [C, E, G] and [C, G, E] etc. \n\n        But wait: we started from the set [4,7,0]. The permutation [0,4,7] is one of the permutations. \n\n        So we are good.\n\n        However, let me do the inversion example: \"E G C\" -> [4,7,0]\n\n        We generate all permutations of [4,7,0]:\n\n            [4,7,0]: d1=3, d2=(0-7)%12=5 -> no.\n            [4,0,7]: d1=(0-4)%12=8, d2=(7-0)=7 -> no.\n            [7,4,0]: d1=(4-7)%12= (4-7+12)=9, d2=(0-4)%12=8 -> no.\n            [7,0,4]: d1=(0-7)%12=5, d2=(4-0)=4 -> no.\n            [0,4,7]: d1=4, d2=3 -> major found.\n            [0,7,4]: d1= (7-0)=7, d2=(4-7)%12= (4-7+12)=9 -> no.\n\n        So we do find the major pattern in [0,4,7] (which is the same as the original C E G). \n\n        Therefore, the method works.\n\n        But wait: how do we get the set [0,4,7] from [4,7,0]? We are generating all permutations, so we will definitely get [0,4,7] as one of the permutations.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n        Steps:\n\n        1. Map the input notes to numbers.\n\n        2. Create a list of the three numbers.\n\n        3. Generate all permutations of the list.\n\n        4. For each permutation, extract a, b, c.\n\n        5. Compute d1 = (b - a) % 12, d2 = (c - b) % 12.\n\n        6. Check if (d1,d2) is (4,3) or (3,4).\n\n        7. If we find (4,3): mark major as True.\n           If we find (3,4): mark minor as True.\n\n        8. Print accordingly.\n\n        However, note: what if the chord is major and we also have a minor pattern? The problem says the answer is unambiguous.\n\n        Let me test with a chord that is both? \n\n        Conditions for major: two consecutive intervals of 4 and 3 (total 7).\n        Conditions for minor: two consecutive intervals of 3 and 4 (total 7).\n\n        Is there a chord that satisfies both? \n\n        Consider: We need two different orderings: one that gives [4,3] and one that gives [3,4]. \n\n        Example: \n            Let the chord be [x, y, z] such that:\n                (y-x)%12=4, (z-y)%12=3 -> then (z-x)%12=7.\n                Also, we need an ordering that gives (a,b,c) such that (b-a)%12=3 and (c-b)%12=4.\n\n            But note: the same set of three notes must satisfy two different interval structures.\n\n            Example: \n                Major: [0,4,7] -> [0,4,7] gives (4,3)\n                Minor: we need an ordering [a,b,c] such that (b-a)%12=3 and (c-b)%12=4.\n\n                Let's try to find an ordering for [0,4,7] that gives 3 and then 4.\n\n                Possibilities:\n                    [0,4,7]: 4 and 3 -> not 3 and 4.\n                    [0,7,4]: 7 and (4-7+12)=9 -> no.\n                    [4,0,7]: (0-4)=8, (7-0)=7 -> no.\n                    [4,7,0]: (7-4)=3, (0-7)=5 -> no.\n                    [7,0,4]: (0-7)=5, (4-0)=4 -> no 3 then 4.\n                    [7,4,0]: (4-7)=9, (0-4)=8 -> no.\n\n                So [0,4,7] is only major.\n\n            Another example: \n                What about a diminished chord? \n                Diminished chord: three notes equally spaced by 3 semitones? \n                Example: [0,3,6] (diminished triad). \n                Check for major/minor: \n                    [0,3,6]: d1=3, d2=3 -> no.\n                    [0,6,3]: d1=6, d2=(3-6)=9 -> no.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves analyzing the intervals between the notes in all possible orderings to check if they meet the criteria for a major or minor chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each note is mapped to a unique integer from 0 to 11 based on its position in the chromatic scale (C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, B=10, H=11).\n2. **Generating Permutations**: All six possible permutations of the three input notes are generated to explore every possible ordering.\n3. **Checking Intervals**: For each permutation, the intervals between consecutive notes are calculated. The first interval (from the first to the second note) and the second interval (from the second to the third note) are checked to see if they match the patterns required for a major chord (4 semitones followed by 3 semitones) or a minor chord (3 semitones followed by 4 semitones).\n4. **Decision Making**: If any permutation matches the major chord pattern, the answer is \"major\". If any permutation matches the minor chord pattern, the answer is \"minor\". If neither pattern is found, the answer is \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    mapping = {\n        'C': 0,\n        'C#': 1,\n        'D': 2,\n        'D#': 3,\n        'E': 4,\n        'F': 5,\n        'F#': 6,\n        'G': 7,\n        'G#': 8,\n        'A': 9,\n        'B': 10,\n        'H': 11\n    }\n    \n    input_str = input().strip()\n    parts = input_str.split()\n    \n    if len(parts) != 3:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    try:\n        nums = [mapping[note] for note in parts]\n    except KeyError:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    perms = list(itertools.permutations(nums))\n    \n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for perm in perms:\n        a, b, c = perm\n        d1 = (b - a) % 12\n        d2 = (c - b) % 12\n        \n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n    if found_major:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The `mapping` dictionary assigns each note to a number, creating a numerical representation for easier interval calculations.\n2. **Input Handling**: The input string is split into three parts, each representing a note. These notes are converted into their corresponding numerical values using the `mapping` dictionary.\n3. **Permutations Generation**: The `itertools.permutations` function generates all six possible orderings of the three input notes.\n4. **Interval Calculation**: For each permutation, the intervals between consecutive notes are calculated using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n5. **Pattern Matching**: The code checks if any permutation has intervals matching the major (4, 3) or minor (3, 4) chord patterns. If found, it prints the corresponding result; otherwise, it prints \"strange\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible orderings of the input notes to determine the chord type, leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of musical notes.",
