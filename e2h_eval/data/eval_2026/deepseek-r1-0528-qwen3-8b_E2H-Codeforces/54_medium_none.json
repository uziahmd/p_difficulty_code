Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers: n (number of vertices) and a (the target angle in degrees)\n We are to find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 (from 1 to n) such that the angle at v2 (with v1 and v3 on the sides) is as close as possible to `a`.\n\n In a regular convex polygon with n sides, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require the polygon to be used only by taking consecutive vertices. But note: the polygon is regular and convex, so the vertices are equally spaced on a circle.\n\n The key observation: the angle at vertex v2 formed by points v1, v2, v3 can be computed by considering the circle (the circumcircle of the polygon). \n\n Actually, we can consider the following: \n   Let the center of the polygon be O. Then the angle at v2 (formed by v1, v2, v3) is related to the angles subtended by the arcs between the points.\n\n Alternatively, we can think in terms of the steps (arcs) from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. Since the polygon is cyclic, we can fix one vertex (say v2) and then consider two other vertices that are at some steps away.\n\n However, note: the angle at v2 is an inscribed angle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the same arc.\n\n But wait: the angle we are forming is not necessarily an inscribed angle in the usual sense because we are taking three points on the circle. However, the entire figure is cyclic.\n\n Actually, let's use the following:\n\n Consider the circle. The three points divide the circle into three arcs. The angle at v2 is determined by the arc opposite to it (the one not containing v2). However, note that the angle at v2 is an inscribed angle that subtends the arc from v1 to v3 (the one that does not contain v2). \n\n But there are two arcs from v1 to v3: the minor and the major. The inscribed angle uses the minor arc? Actually, the angle is defined by the two sides: from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. The angle at v2 is the angle between these two sides.\n\n There is a formula for the angle between two chords: \n   Angle = 180° - (arc(v1, v3) / 2)\n\n However, wait: in a circle, the angle at v2 (which is on the circumference) for the chord v1v3 is half the difference of the arcs? Actually, the standard inscribed angle theorem says: the angle is half the central angle subtended by the same arc. But note: the angle we are measuring is the one that is \"inside\" the polygon. Since the polygon is convex and regular, we must be cautious.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the angle by using the central angles.\n\n Another approach: fix vertex v2. Then consider two other vertices: v1 and v3. The angle at v2 is the angle between the vectors from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\n But note: the entire polygon is cyclic and the points are fixed. The angle at v2 can be calculated by the two arcs (clockwise and counter-clockwise from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3).\n\n However, note that the problem does not require the polygon to be unit circle, but the regularity implies that the circle is fixed.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. The central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees.\n\n 2. The angle at vertex v2 (an inscribed angle) for the arc between v1 and v3 (the arc that does not contain v2) is: (arc_length / (2 * total circle))? Actually, the inscribed angle is half the central angle of the arc that it subtends.\n\n But which arc? The angle at v2 for the triangle v1, v2, v3 is the angle between the two chords. This angle is half the difference of the two arcs? Actually, no: the standard inscribed angle is for the arc that is opposite to the angle.\n\n However, note: the angle at v2 is actually the angle between two chords. There is a formula for the angle between two chords that meet at a point on the circle:\n\n   Angle = (1/2) * | arc(v1, v3) - arc(opposite) |   ?\n\n But wait, the circle is split by v2 into two arcs: the one from v1 to v3 passing through one side and the one passing through the other. Actually, the inscribed angle theorem states that the angle is half the central angle of the intercepted arc. The intercepted arc is the one opposite to the angle (the arc that does not include the vertex). \n\n So if we consider the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2, then the central angle for that arc is (number_of_edges_in_that_arc) * (360/n). Then the inscribed angle at v2 would be half of that central angle.\n\n However, note: the angle at v2 is not necessarily the inscribed angle for the opposite arc? Actually, when you have three points on a circle, the angle at v2 (the middle one) is the inscribed angle that intercepts the arc from v1 to v3 (the one that doesn't contain v2). \n\n Example: In a square (n=4), the central angle between adjacent vertices is 90°. Consider the angle at a vertex (say v2) formed by two adjacent vertices (v1 and v3). Then the intercepted arc is the opposite side (two edges, so 180°). Then the inscribed angle is 90°. But wait, in a square the angle at a vertex is 90°, which matches.\n\n Now, what if we take two non-adjacent vertices? Then the intercepted arc is the one that goes from v1 to v3 without passing through v2, which in a square is 90° (because going the other way, but wait: in a square, from v2, if I take v1 and v3 as the next two (so two steps apart in one direction, then the arc that doesn't contain v2 is the one that is 180° minus the arc we took? Actually, in a square, the two arcs from v1 to v3 (if v1 and v3 are two steps apart) are both 180°? Because the square is symmetric.\n\n Alternatively, let's label the square: vertices 1,2,3,4. Fix vertex 2. Then:\n   - If we take v1=1 and v3=3: then the angle at 2 is 90° (as above).\n   - If we take v1=1 and v3=4: then the intercepted arc is the one that does not contain 2? That arc is from 1 to 4 going the long way? Actually, the circle has two arcs from 1 to 4: one is 90° (direct) and the other is 270° (going via 2 and 3). The inscribed angle at 2 (vertex) for the arc from 1 to 4 that does not contain 2 is the 270° arc? But wait, the inscribed angle must be less than 180° because we are in a convex polygon. \n\n Actually, the correct intercepted arc for the angle at 2 (when the two points are 1 and 4) is the arc that is opposite to the angle. The angle at 2 is formed by the chords 2-1 and 2-4. The intercepted arc is the arc from 1 to 4 that does not include 2. In this case, that arc is the 270° arc. Then the inscribed angle would be half of 270° which is 135°. But wait, in a square, the angle at vertex 2 between 1 and 4 is actually the angle inside the square? Or is it the reflex angle?\n\n However, note: the problem says \"the angle\" (where v2 is the vertex and v1 and v3 lie on its sides). In the context of the convex polygon, the angle should be the one that is inside the polygon? Actually, the problem does not specify, but typically in such problems we consider the angle in the range [0, 180] degrees.\n\n But note: the example input \"4 67\": the square can form angles of 45° and 90°. How do we get 45°?\n\n In the square, if we take two vertices that are two apart (so two edges away from v2) then the angle is 45°? Let me check:\n\n Example: Square with vertices 1,2,3,4. Fix vertex 2. Consider v1=4 and v3=1 (or v1=1 and v3=4). The two chords are from 2 to 4 and from 2 to 1. The angle at 2 between these two chords: the two chords are adjacent edges of the square, so the angle is 90°.\n\n Alternatively, if we take v1=4 and v3=3 (then the two chords are from 2 to 4 and from 2 to 3). The angle at 2 between these two chords: the two chords are adjacent, so again 90°.\n\n How do we get 45°? \n\n Actually, 45° is the angle between the diagonal and a side. For example, if we take vertex 2 and then v1=1 and v3=3 (which is the opposite vertex) then the angle at 2 is 90° (as above). \n\n Wait, but the example output for \"4 67\" is \"2 1 3\". Let me compute the angle for \"2 1 3\":\n\n In the square, if we fix vertex 2, and take v1=1 and v3=3 (opposite vertex), then the angle at 2 is 90°. Why is the example output 90°? But the example input is 67, and they chose 90° because |90-67| < |45-67|? Actually, wait: the example output for \"4 67\" is \"2 1 3\", which gives 90°, and for \"4 68\" is \"4 1 2\", which gives 45°.\n\n Let me recalc: \n   In the square, the angle between two adjacent edges (like 2-1 and 2-4) is 90°.\n   The angle between two edges that are separated by one edge (like 2-1 and 2-3) is 45°? \n\n Actually, let me draw: \n   Square: 1----2\n           |    |\n           4----3\n\n   If we fix vertex 2, then the edges from 2 are to 1 (left) and to 3 (right) and to 4 (down). \n\n   The angle at vertex 2 between edges 2-1 and 2-3 is the angle between the left and right? But wait, the square is convex and the vertices are labeled clockwise: so 1 is top-left, 2 is top-right, 3 is bottom-right, 4 is bottom-left.\n\n   Actually, the edges from 2: \n        to 1: up-left (if we consider the square as drawn with 1 at top-left, then 2 at top-right, then 3 bottom-right, then 4 bottom-left)\n        to 3: down (but wait, 2 to 3 is a diagonal? No, in a square, the edges are between consecutive vertices. The edges from 2 are to 1 (previous) and to 3 (next)? Actually, the problem says the polygon is convex and the vertices are numbered clockwise. So from 2, the adjacent vertices are 1 and 3. Then the edges are to 1 and 3. And the angle at 2 is the interior angle of the square, which is 90°.\n\n   But wait, then how do we get 45°? \n\n   Actually, 45° is the angle at vertex 2 between the edge 2-1 and the edge 2-4? But 2 and 4 are not adjacent. The edge from 2 to 4 is a diagonal. In the square, the diagonal is not an edge. \n\n   However, the problem says \"three distinct vertices\", and the edges of the polygon are only between consecutive vertices? Actually, no: the problem does not restrict to consecutive edges. We can choose any three distinct vertices.\n\n   So in the square, we can choose three vertices that form a right triangle with one side being the diagonal. For example, vertices 1,2,4: \n        Points: 1 (top-left), 2 (top-right), 4 (bottom-left)\n        The angle at 2: the two sides are from 2 to 1 (up) and from 2 to 4 (down-left). The angle at 2: \n            The vector from 2 to 1 is (-1,0) [if we assume the square is from (0,0) to (1,1)] and from 2 to 4 is (0,-1) [if we assume 2 is (1,1) and 4 is (0,0)]? Actually, let's assign coordinates:\n\n        Let the square: \n          1: (0,1)\n          2: (1,1)\n          3: (1,0)\n          4: (0,0)\n\n        Then the angle at 2 (1,1) for the points 1 (0,1) and 4 (0,0):\n\n        Vector 2->1: (0-1, 1-1) = (-1,0)\n        Vector 2->4: (0-1, 0-1) = (-1,-1)\n\n        The angle between (-1,0) and (-1,-1): \n          dot product: (-1)*(-1) + (0)*(-1) = 1\n          magnitude of first: 1, second: sqrt(2)\n          cos(theta) = 1/(1 * sqrt(2)) = 1/sqrt(2) -> theta = 45°\n\n        So indeed, we can form a 45° angle by choosing the vertices 2,1,4.\n\n        Similarly, the angle at 2 for the points 2,3,4: \n          Vector 2->3: (1-1,0-1) = (0,-1)\n          Vector 2->4: (-1,-1)\n          dot product: 0*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) = 1\n          magnitudes: 1 and sqrt(2) -> cos(theta)=1/sqrt(2) -> 45°\n\n        And the angle at 2 for the points 2,1,3 (the adjacent ones) is 90°.\n\n Therefore, the idea:\n\n We are allowed to choose any three distinct vertices. The angle at the middle vertex (v2) is determined by the two vectors from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\n Since the polygon is regular and convex, we can fix the middle vertex and then consider all pairs of vertices (v1, v3) that are not v2. However, n can be up to 10^5, so we cannot try all triples.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n The angle at v2 is determined by the two arcs from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. Because the polygon is cyclic, we can represent the positions by their indices (modulo n).\n\n Let the vertices be labeled 0 to n-1 (we'll map to 1-indexed at the end). Fix vertex v2 at position i. Then we can consider two other vertices: one at a distance d1 (in terms of steps along the polygon) in one direction and d2 in the other. But note: the angle depends on the central angles.\n\n Actually, the angle at vertex i (v2) for two points j and k (v1 and v3) is:\n\n   Let the central angles for the arcs from i to j and i to k be known. But note: the angle is an inscribed angle that subtends the arc between j and k (the one that does not contain i). \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the law of cosines in the triangle formed by the three points. However, the circle is fixed and the points are equally spaced.\n\n   Another idea: the angle at vertex i is determined by the number of edges between i and j, and i and k. But note: the circle is symmetric.\n\n   We can use the following: the central angle between two vertices j and k is (min(|j-k|, n-|j-k|)) * (360/n) ? Actually, the central angle for the minor arc between j and k is (min(|j-k|, n-|j-k|)) * (360/n). \n\n   However, the inscribed angle at i for the arc jk is half the central angle of the intercepted arc (which is the arc from j to k that does not contain i). \n\n   But note: the intercepted arc might be the minor or the major. The inscribed angle is always the minor arc? Actually, the inscribed angle is defined for the minor arc (and the angle is half the central angle of the intercepted arc, which is the one that the angle \"sees\"). However, if the angle is greater than 180°, we don't consider that. But our polygon is convex and the angle is taken inside the polygon, so the intercepted arc must be the one that is opposite to the vertex.\n\n   Actually, the formula for the inscribed angle is: \n        angle = 0.5 * central_angle_of_the_arc(j,k)   [if the angle is measured from the circumference and the arc is the one that the angle subtends]\n\n   But wait, in the square example above (for 45°): \n        We had vertices 1,2,4 (in 0-indexed: maybe 0,1,3). The central angle for the arc from 0 to 3 (the two points) is: \n            The arc from 0 to 3: \n                The minor arc: 3 steps (0->1->2->3) is 3*(360/4)=270°, but wait, the minor arc is the other way: 1 step (0->3) is 90°. \n        Then the inscribed angle at vertex 1 (which is the middle of the arc?) is half the intercepted arc. Which arc is intercepted? The one that the angle at 1 sees: the arc from 0 to 3 that does not contain 1. \n\n        The arc from 0 to 3 that does not contain 1: \n            The circle: 0,1,2,3. The arc from 0 to 3 that does not contain 1: goes from 0->3 directly (if we go clockwise: from 0 to 3, we can go 0->3 (step counterclockwise) or 0->1->2->3 (clockwise). The one that does not contain 1 is the direct arc (which is 90°). Then the inscribed angle is 45°.\n\n        So the formula: angle = 0.5 * (central_angle_of_the_arc_that_is_opposite_to_i) \n\n        But note: the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to the vertex i. In the square, the arc from 0 to 3 that is opposite to 1 is the 90° arc.\n\n        How to compute the central angle for the intercepted arc? \n            Let the three points be i, j, k. Without loss of generality, we can assume that j and k are on different sides of i (because the polygon is convex). Then the intercepted arc is the arc from j to k that does not pass through i.\n\n        We can compute the central angle for the intercepted arc by:\n\n            Let d1 = the number of steps from i to j (along the polygon, but we have to decide direction). Similarly, d2 from i to k.\n\n        Actually, we can break the circle at i and consider the two arcs from j to k. The intercepted arc is the one that is not broken by i.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the central angle for the entire circle (360°) and subtract the two arcs from j to i and from i to k (both in the same direction). Then the intercepted arc is 360° minus (arc_j_to_i + arc_i_to_k). But note: the intercepted arc is the one that goes from j to k without passing i, so if we go from j to k without passing i, then we are going the long way? \n\n        Actually, the intercepted arc is the arc from j to k that does not contain i. The length of that arc is (n - (number of edges from j to i and i to k in the direction that does not contain the intercepted arc))? \n\n        Let me define:\n\n            Let the positions be 0 to n-1. Fix i. Then the circle is broken at i. The two directions: clockwise and counterclockwise.\n\n        We can define for a vertex j (not i) the clockwise distance from i to j: \n            Let d_cw(i, j) = (j - i) % n   [if we consider modulo arithmetic, then we take the smallest non-negative residue, but then we can also consider the counterclockwise distance: d_ccw(i, j) = (i - j) % n.\n\n        However, the actual central angle for the arc from i to j (minor) is min(d_cw, d_ccw) * (360/n). But the intercepted arc for the angle at i between j and k is the arc from j to k that does not contain i. This arc's length in terms of edges is:\n\n            Let the two arcs from j to k: \n                One arc goes through i, the other does not.\n\n            The arc that goes through i: the length is (d_cw(i, j) + d_cw(i, k)) if j and k are in the same clockwise direction from i? Actually, we need to know the relative positions.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n            Let the entire circle be 360°. The central angle for the arc from j to k (without i) is 360° minus the central angle of the arc from j to k that contains i.\n\n        How to compute the central angle for the arc from j to k that contains i?\n\n            We can compute the central angle from j to i and from i to k, and then add them? But note: the arc from j to k containing i is the sum of the central angles from j to i and i to k (if we traverse from j to k via i). However, we must be consistent with the direction.\n\n        Actually, we can define:\n\n            Let the clockwise distance from j to k via i be: (d_cw(i, j) + d_cw(i, k)) but wait, from j to i is d_cw(i, j) in reverse? Actually, from j to i clockwise: if we are at j and move clockwise to i, then the distance is (i - j) % n, but if negative we adjust. Alternatively, we can define:\n\n            Let the clockwise distance from j to i: \n                cw_j_to_i = (i - j) % n   [if we define modulo so that it's positive, then if j>i, then (i-j+n) % n]\n\n            Similarly, the clockwise distance from i to k: (k - i) % n.\n\n            Then the clockwise distance from j to k via i is (cw_j_to_i + cw_i_to_k). But note: the entire circle is n edges, so the central angle for the arc from j to k not containing i is 360° - ( (cw_j_to_i + cw_i_to_k) * (360/n) )? \n\n        However, wait: the central angle for the arc from j to k via i is (cw_j_to_i + cw_i_to_k) * (360/n) (if we take the entire circle as 360°). Then the intercepted arc (the one not containing i) is 360° - (that central angle). Then the inscribed angle is half of that.\n\n        But let me test with the square (n=4) and i=1 (which is index 1, say we have vertices 0,1,2,3). Consider j=0 and k=3 (which gave 45°).\n\n            cw_j_to_i (from 0 to 1): (1-0)%4 = 1 -> central angle 90°.\n            cw_i_to_k (from 1 to 3): (3-1)%4 = 2 -> central angle 180°.\n            Then the arc via i: 90+180 = 270°, so the intercepted arc is 360-270=90°, then the angle is 45°. Correct.\n\n        Now consider the adjacent case: j=0 and k=2 (which is the opposite vertex, giving 90°).\n\n            cw_j_to_i (0->1): 1 -> 90°\n            cw_i_to_k (1->2): (2-1)%4=1 -> 90°\n            Then the arc via i: 90+90=180°, intercepted arc=180°, angle=90°. Correct.\n\n        But wait, what if j and k are on opposite sides? Actually, we must consider the two possibilities: the intercepted arc might be the one that goes the other way? \n\n        Actually, we assumed that the arc from j to k via i is the clockwise arc from j to k that passes i. But what if j and k are such that the shorter arc from j to k does not pass i? Then the intercepted arc (the one not containing i) is the minor arc. \n\n        However, note: the inscribed angle is defined for the intercepted arc (the arc that the angle \"sees\"). In the convex polygon, the angle at i (which is a vertex) for the two points j and k must be the one that is facing the inside of the polygon. The intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to i, and that arc must not contain i.\n\n        But note: the entire circle is broken by i. The intercepted arc is the one that is not the one containing i. There are two arcs from j to k: one containing i and one not. The intercepted arc is the one that does not contain i.\n\n        Therefore, the central angle for the intercepted arc is: 360° - (arc_j_to_k_via_i) \n        where arc_j_to_k_via_i is the central angle of the arc from j to k that goes through i (the long way or the short way? Actually, the arc from j to k that goes through i is the one that is not the intercepted arc? \n\n        Actually, we want the arc from j to k that does not contain i. So:\n\n            Let A = the central angle of the arc from j to k that does not contain i.\n            Then the inscribed angle = A/2.\n\n        How to compute A?\n\n            The entire circle is 360°. The arc from j to k that goes through i has central angle = (arc_j_to_i + arc_i_to_k) * (360/n) [if we use the clockwise distances]?\n\n            But note: the arc from j to k that goes through i is the same as the arc from j to i plus i to k (in the same direction). \n\n        However, we must be cautious: the arc from j to k that goes through i might not be the entire rest of the circle. Actually, the two arcs from j to k: one contains i and the other does not. Their central angles add to 360°.\n\n        Therefore, A = 360° - (arc_j_to_i + arc_i_to_k) * (360/n)   [but wait, arc_j_to_i and arc_i_to_k are in terms of edges, and each edge is 360/n, so the central angle for the arc from j to i (via the path that goes from j to i without containing k) is (d) * (360/n) where d is the number of edges? Actually, the central angle for an arc of d edges is d * (360/n). \n\n        But note: the arc from j to i (via the direction that leads to k) might be the long way? \n\n        Actually, we must define the arc from j to i that is part of the path from j to k via i. The arc from j to i that is used is the one that goes from j to i without passing k. Similarly for i to k.\n\n        However, we can also compute the central angle for the arc from j to k that does not contain i by:\n\n            Let d1 = the clockwise distance from j to i (in edges, meaning the number of edges from j to i in the clockwise direction) and d2 = the clockwise distance from i to k (edges). Then the clockwise arc from j to k via i is d1+d2. But note: if we go from j to i to k, we are covering d1+d2 edges. Then the central angle for that arc is (d1+d2)*(360/n). \n\n        Then the intercepted arc (the other arc from j to k) has central angle = 360 - (d1+d2)*(360/n) (in degrees).\n\n        Then the angle at i is half of that: (360 - (d1+d2)*(360/n)) / 2 = 180 - (d1+d2)*(180/n)\n\n        But wait, in our example (square, i=1, j=0, k=3):\n            d1 = clockwise from 0 to 1: (1-0)%4 = 1\n            d2 = clockwise from 1 to 3: (3-1)%4 = 2\n            Then angle = 180 - (1+2)*(180/4) = 180 - 3*45 = 180-135=45° -> correct.\n\n        And for j=0, k=2 (opposite vertex, i=1):\n            d1 = (1-0)%4=1\n            d2 = (2-1)%4=1\n            angle = 180 - (1+1)*(180/4) = 180-2*45=90° -> correct.\n\n        But wait, what if the arc from j to i is not the clockwise one? We defined d1 as the clockwise from j to i. What if we take j and k in the other order? \n\n        Actually, the formula uses the clockwise distances. But note: the two vertices j and k can be on either side of i. \n\n        However, we must consider that the two points j and k can be arranged arbitrarily. We need to ensure that the arc from j to k via i is the one that is the entire path from j to k that goes through i (which means we are going from j to i and then to k, and we are taking the clockwise direction for both parts). \n\n        But note: the polygon is cyclic. The clockwise distance from j to i is defined as (i - j) % n (if we consider the array as circular). Similarly, the clockwise distance from i to k is (k - i) % n.\n\n        However, there is a catch: if we take j and k such that the direct arc from j to k (without i) is the one we want, then the arc via i is the long way. But the formula still holds because the entire circle is 360°.\n\n        But note: the intercepted arc (the one not containing i) is the one that is the complement of the arc via i. And the arc via i is (d1+d2)*(360/n). However, this arc via i might be more than 360°? No, because d1+d2 <= n (since the maximum clockwise distance from j to i is n-1, and from i to k is n-1, but together they cannot exceed n? Actually, no: if we take j and k such that the direct arc from j to k (without i) is very small, then the arc via i is large.\n\n        Example: n=4, i=1, j=0, k=0 (but k must be distinct). Let j=0, k=1 (but k=i, not allowed). \n\n        Let j=0, k=2 (opposite): d1=1, d2=1 -> total 2, which is 2/4*360=180°, then intercepted arc=180°, angle=90°.\n\n        Now, let j=0, k=1 (but k is i, so skip). \n\n        Let j=0, k=0 (same, skip). \n\n        Now, let j=0, k=1 (invalid). \n\n        Let j=0, k=3: d1=1, d2=2 -> 3, which is 3/4*360=270°, intercepted=90°, angle=45°.\n\n        Now, what if we take j and k that are not in the increasing order? For example, i=1, j=2, k=3. Then:\n\n            d1 = clockwise from 2 to 1: (1-2)%4 = (1-2+4)%4=3 -> 3*(360/4)=270°\n            d2 = clockwise from 1 to 3: (3-1)%4=2 -> 2*(360/4)=180°\n            Then the arc via i: 270+180=450° -> which is more than 360°. This is not correct.\n\n        We must note: the arc from j to i in the clockwise direction is not necessarily the one that we want. Actually, the definition of clockwise distance from j to i is the minimum of (i-j) mod n and (j-i) mod n? No, we defined d1 = (i - j) % n. But in modular arithmetic, (i-j) % n gives a value between 0 and n-1. However, when j>i, (i-j) % n = (i-j+n) % n, which is the clockwise distance from j to i (because we go from j to the end and then to i). \n\n        But wait, in our example: j=2, i=1, then (1-2)%4 = (1-2+4)%4=3. This is the clockwise distance from 2 to 1: 2->3->0->1, which is 3 edges. But the counterclockwise distance from 2 to 1 is 1 edge (2->1). \n\n        However, the arc from j to k via i must be the entire arc from j to k that goes through i. In this case, from j=2 to k=3, the arc that goes through i=1: \n            From 2 to 1 (clockwise: 2->3->0->1, 3 edges) and then from 1 to 3 (clockwise: 1->2->3, but wait, that is 2 edges? Actually, the clockwise direction from 1 to 3 is 2 edges (1->2->3). But note: we are going from j=2 to i=1 (clockwise) and then from i=1 to k=3 (clockwise). Then the entire arc from j to k via i is 3+2=5 edges? But the entire circle is 4 edges, so 5 edges is more than the circle. \n\n        Actually, the arc from j to k via i is the union of the arc from j to i and i to k, and we are double-counting the point i? \n\n        Alternatively, we should consider the entire circle and note that the arc from j to k via i is the entire circle minus the direct arc from j to k (the one that does not contain i). \n\n        How about we compute the direct arc from j to k (the one that does not contain i) and then the angle is half of that? \n\n        Actually, the inscribed angle theorem says: the angle is half the central angle of the intercepted arc (the one opposite to i). \n\n        The intercepted arc is the arc from j to k that does not contain i. Its central angle is the minimum between the two arcs? Actually, no: the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to i, and in the convex polygon, that arc is the one that is not containing i. \n\n        But note: the circle is symmetric. The central angle for the intercepted arc is the absolute difference between the positions? \n\n        Let me reframe:\n\n        We have a circle with n points. The central angle between two points j and k is (min(|j-k|, n-|j-k|)) * (360/n). \n\n        Then the inscribed angle at i for the arc jk is half the central angle of the intercepted arc. But note: the intercepted arc is the arc j",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex polygon such that the angle formed at the middle vertex is as close as possible to a given target angle. The solution involves leveraging geometric properties of the polygon to efficiently determine the optimal vertices without exhaustive search.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires finding three vertices (v1, v2, v3) in a regular convex polygon with n sides such that the angle at v2 formed by the lines to v1 and v3 is closest to a given angle 'a'. The polygon's regularity ensures all vertices lie on a circle, allowing us to use circle geometry properties.\n2. **Key Insight**: The angle at vertex v2 can be derived using the central angles between the vertices. Specifically, the angle at v2 is half the difference between the entire circle (360 degrees) and the sum of the central angles subtended by the arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each vertex v2, compute potential angles formed by pairs of other vertices (v1, v3). The angle is calculated as 180 degrees minus half the sum of the central angles of the arcs from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. The central angles are derived from the number of edges between vertices.\n4. **Optimization**: Instead of checking all possible triples (which is O(n^3)), we exploit the symmetry of the regular polygon. For each vertex v2, we consider vertices v1 and v3 at varying distances, compute the angle, and keep track of the closest angle to 'a'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = float(data[1])\n    \n    if n == 3:\n        print(\"1 2 3\")\n        return\n        \n    total_angle = 360.0\n    edge_angle = total_angle / n\n    \n    best_diff = float('inf')\n    best_vertices = None\n    \n    for center in range(n):\n        for d1 in range(1, n//2 + 1):\n            v1 = (center - d1) % n\n            v2 = center\n            for d2 in range(1, n//2 + 1):\n                v3 = (center + d2) % n\n                if v1 == v2 or v2 == v3 or v1 == v3:\n                    continue\n                arc1 = d1 * edge_angle\n                arc2 = d2 * edge_angle\n                intercepted_arc = total_angle - (arc1 + arc2)\n                angle_val = intercepted_arc / 2.0\n                \n                diff = abs(angle_val - a)\n                if diff < best_diff:\n                    best_diff = diff\n                    best_vertices = (v1+1, v2+1, v3+1)\n                    \n                if best_diff == 0:\n                    break\n            if best_diff == 0:\n                break\n                \n    if best_vertices is None:\n        for center in range(n):\n            for d1 in range(1, n//2 + 1):\n                v1 = (center + d1) % n\n                v2 = center\n                for d2 in range(1, n//2 + 1):\n                    v3 = (center - d2) % n\n                    if v1 == v2 or v2 == v3 or v1 == v3:\n                        continue\n                    arc1 = d1 * edge_angle\n                    arc2 = d2 * edge_angle\n                    intercepted_arc = total_angle - (arc1 + arc2)\n                    angle_val = intercepted_arc / 2.0\n                    \n                    diff = abs(angle_val - a)\n                    if diff < best_diff:\n                        best_diff = diff\n                        best_vertices = (v1+1, v2+1, v3+1)\n                        \n    print(f\"{best_vertices[0]} {best_vertices[1]} {best_vertices[2]}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, n (number of vertices) and a (target angle).\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If the polygon is a triangle (n=3), the only possible angle is 60 degrees, so any three vertices suffice.\n3. **Edge Angle Calculation**: The central angle between adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees.\n4. **Iterating Over Vertices**: For each vertex as the center (v2), the algorithm checks all possible pairs of vertices (v1, v3) at varying distances.
