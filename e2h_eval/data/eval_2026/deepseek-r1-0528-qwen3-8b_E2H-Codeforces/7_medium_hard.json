The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\nWe are constructing a snowflake as follows:\n- Start with 1 vertex (step 0).\n- Then, we do at least one step. In each step, every vertex that has degree 1 (i.e., connected to only one other vertex) is used to add k new edges (thus creating k new vertices for each such vertex).\n\nBut note: the process is done in layers. The first step: we start from the center (degree 0 initially). Then, we connect the center to k new vertices. Now the center has degree k, and the k new vertices have degree 1.\n\nIn the next step, we take every vertex with degree 1 (the k leaves) and attach k new vertices to each. So we add k*k new vertices. Now the total number of vertices is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nWait, but note: the problem says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" is connected by edges to k more new vertices, and this step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the snowflake is built in layers (or iterations). Let m be the number of steps (at least 1). Then the total number of vertices is:\n\nStep 0: 1\nStep 1: 1 + k\nStep 2: 1 + k + k^2\nStep 3: 1 + k + k^2 + k^3\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Actually, note the rule: in the first step, we add k new vertices. Then, each of these k vertices (each has degree 1) will be expanded in the next step, so we add k * k = k^2. However, note that the center is never expanded again because its degree becomes k (which is >=2) and then it stops. Similarly, after step i, the vertices that are at level i (the outermost ring) have degree 1 and are expanded in the next step.\n\nSo the total number of vertices after m steps is:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\nThis is a geometric series. We can write:\n\nn = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\nBut note: the problem says we must do at least one step (so m>=1). Therefore, the smallest snowflake is when m=1: n = 1 + k, which must be at least 1+k (with k>1). \n\nHowever, there is another way to think: maybe the expansion is not necessarily symmetric in all directions? But the problem states that we add k new edges to each leaf (vertex with degree 1). So the process is deterministic and the graph is symmetric.\n\nBut note: the example for k=4: the smallest possible snowflake (m=1) would be 1+4 = 5. The example figure shows the smallest for k=4, but the problem says \"the smallest possible snowflake for k=4\", so m=1.\n\nBut wait, the example input includes 6 and 13, etc.\n\nLet's check the example outputs:\n\nInput: \n9\n1\n2\n3\n6\n13\n15\n255\n10101\n1000000000000000000\n\nOutput:\nNO\nNO\nNO\nNO\nYES\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nFor n=1: NO -> because we must have at least one step (m>=1) and k>1, so minimum vertices is 1+k (which is at least 3). But wait, even m=1 gives at least 3? Actually, if k=2 then m=1: n=3; k=3: n=4; k=4: n=5, etc. So n=1 is too small.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" is connected by edges to k more new vertices, and this step should be done at least once. So the initial graph (only one vertex) is step0. Then we do at least one step (step1). So the minimal n is 1 + k, and k>1 => minimal n is 3.\n\nSimilarly, n=2: cannot be represented because the minimal is 3.\n\nn=3: then k=2, m=1: 1+2=3 -> YES.\n\nWait, but the example output for n=3 is \"NO\". Why?\n\nLet me reread the problem statement: \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\" Then, \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\nBut note: the step must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake is built by two steps? Actually, no: the first step (connecting the center to k) is mandatory. Then the second part says: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (the k leaves) are to be expanded. And the problem says \"this step should be done at least once\". Which step? The entire process of expanding the leaves? Or the first expansion (from the center) is the first step and then the expansion of the leaves is the second step and we must do at least one expansion (meaning the second step must be done at least once)? \n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"This step should be done at least once.\" The step is: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices\". And note that the first expansion (from the center) is not the same as the step for leaves? \n\nActually, the problem breaks down the construction in two parts:\n\n1. The initial graph has one vertex.\n2. Then, we do the following repeatedly (at least once) until we stop? But the problem says: \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1). Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\nWait, the wording is ambiguous. Let me parse:\n\n- Step 1: Start with one vertex.\n- Step 2: Then, we do two things? Or the first expansion (from the center) is the first application of the rule? Or is the first expansion considered separately?\n\nLooking at the example: the smallest for k=4 is shown. Typically, the smallest snowflake for k=4 is a central node with 4 edges (so 4 leaves). Then, the problem says \"each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (the leaves) are expanded. But the problem says \"this step should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion of the leaves must be done at least once? Then the minimal snowflake for k=4 would have 1 (center) + 4 (first expansion) + 4*4 (second expansion) = 1+4+16 = 21.\n\nBut wait, the example output says for n=13: YES and n=15: YES. Also, n=255: YES, n=10101: YES, and n=1000000000000000000: NO.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the possibility that the problem means the entire process (starting from the center and including all layers) must have been applied at least once (meaning the first expansion is the first time we use k, and then we must also expand the leaves? But the problem says: \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1). Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\nThe phrase \"This step\" refers to the entire description? Or just the last sentence? The problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", and \"This step\" likely refers to the expansion of the leaves (because the first expansion is described as a separate action). \n\nBut then the example smallest for k=4: the figure probably shows a snowflake with 5 vertices (the center and 4 leaves). Then why does the problem say \"the smallest possible snowflake for k=4\"? If the step (expanding leaves) must be done at least once, then we must have the center, the first ring (4), and then the second ring (16) making 21. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"This step should be done at least once.\" and the step is defined as: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices\". The first expansion (from the center) creates leaves (vertices with degree 1). Then, the next step (the one that must be done at least once) is to expand those leaves. So the minimal snowflake must have at least two layers: the center, the first ring, and the second ring.\n\nBut then the minimal n would be 1 + k + k^2.\n\nThen, for k=2: minimal n= 1+2+4 = 7.\nk=3: 1+3+9=13\nk=4: 1+4+16=21\n\nThen the example: n=13 -> YES (k=3, m=2). n=15 -> ?\n\nBut wait, 15 is 1 + k + k^2 + ... ? Let's see:\n\nIf we have two layers (m=2): n = 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut what about three layers (m=3): n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3.\n\nSo the total number of vertices is a geometric series with ratio k, starting from 1, and having (m+1) terms (from exponent 0 to m).\n\nBut note: the problem says we must do the expansion step (the leaf expansion) at least once. The first expansion (from the center) is the first time we add edges, and then the leaf expansion is the second time. So the minimal is two expansions? Actually, the problem says:\n\n- Initially: one vertex (step0)\n- Then, we do the initial expansion (from the center) and then we must do the leaf expansion at least once.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\" and then \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\nThis implies two distinct steps:\n\nStep 1: Expand the center (initial vertex) to k new vertices.\nStep 2: Expand every leaf (vertex with degree 1) to k new vertices, and this step (step 2) must be done at least once.\n\nBut note: after step 1, we have the center (degree k) and k leaves (each degree 1). Then step 2 is applied to the k leaves. Then after step 2, the leaves become vertices of degree k+1 (they were degree 1, then we add k edges, so now degree k+1) and we get k*k new leaves (from the expansion of the original leaves). \n\nSo the minimal snowflake has two layers (the center, the first ring, and the second ring). Therefore, the minimal n is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut wait, the example input includes n=3 and n=6, which are less than 13 (the minimal for k=2) and 1+2+4=7, so n=3 and n=6 are not of the form 1+k+k^2 for k>1 and integer k? \n\nBut the example output for n=3 is \"NO\", and for n=6 is \"NO\". \n\nBut then what about n=13? It is 1+3+9 -> k=3, two layers. So YES.\n\nAnd n=15? 15 = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3? or 1+k+k^2? Let me check:\n\nFor two layers (m=2): n = 1+k+k^2. For k=2: 1+2+4=7; k=3:13; k=4:21 -> no 15.\n\nThree layers (m=3): n = 1+k+k^2+k^3.\n\nk=2: 1+2+4+8=15 -> YES.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the step (expanding leaves) must be done at least once. In the three-layer case, we did two expansions: first the center (step1) and then two expansions (step2 and step3). But the problem says the step (expanding leaves) must be done at least once. Here, we did it twice (step2 and step3). That is acceptable because the condition is at least once.\n\nSo the formula is: n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, for some m>=2 (since we require at least one expansion of leaves, meaning m>=2 layers? Actually, note: the center is layer0, then the first expansion is layer1, then the second expansion is layer2. So the number of expansions (steps) is m, and the total layers (including the center) is m+1. The problem requires at least one leaf expansion (step2) so m>=2? Actually, wait:\n\nThe problem says: \n- First: connect the center to k new vertices (this is the first expansion, which we must do).\n- Then, the step (expanding leaves) must be done at least once (so we must do the second expansion at least once). \n\nTherefore, we must have at least two expansions: the first (from center) and the second (from leaves). So the minimal layers (excluding the center) is 2, meaning total layers (including center) is 3, so the series has 3 terms: 1, k, k^2. \n\nBut wait, in the three-layer case (m=3) we have four terms: 1, k, k^2, k^3. The layers (excluding the center) are 3? \n\nActually, the expansion steps:\n\nStep0: center (1 node)\nStep1: add k nodes (now total 1+k)\nStep2: add k^2 nodes (now total 1+k+k^2)\nStep3: add k^3 nodes (now total 1+k+k^2+k^3)\n\nSo the number of expansion steps (after the initial center) is m (where m>=2, because we must do the leaf expansion at least once, meaning step2 and beyond). But note: the problem says the entire process: \n\n\"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1). Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\nSo the \"then\" part includes two actions: \n1. Connect the center to k new vertices.\n2. Then, the step (expanding leaves) is done at least once.\n\nTherefore, the minimal is two expansions (the center expansion and one leaf expansion). Then the minimal n is 1+k+k^2.\n\nBut then how is n=15 valid? 15 = 1+2+4+8, which is m=3 (three expansion steps: step1, step2, step3). But wait, the problem says the leaf expansion step must be done at least once. So step2 (the first leaf expansion) must be done, and then step3 (the second leaf expansion) is an additional one. The condition is satisfied.\n\nSo the general formula is: n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, for some integer m>=2 (because we need at least two expansions: step1 (center) and step2 (leaves)), and k>1.\n\nBut note: the problem does not specify that we must stop after exactly two expansions. We can have more. So we need to check if n can be written as:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m   for some integers k>1 and m>=2.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\nn = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\nBut note: we can have different m and k.\n\nBut n can be up to 10^18, and t up to 10000.\n\nHow can we check for a given n?\n\nNote: the minimal representation is with m=2: n = 1 + k + k^2. Then we can also have m>=3.\n\nBut note: we can also have the same n represented in two different ways? Probably not, because the base k is fixed and the exponent m is variable.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require to find k and m, only to determine whether there exists ANY k>1 and m>=2 such that the equation holds.\n\nWe can try to fix m (the number of expansion steps, which is the number of layers excluding the center, so the exponent goes from 1 to m). But note: m can be as large as log_k(n). However, k can be very large (for example, if k is about n^(1/2), then m=2, etc.)\n\nAlternatively, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nn = 1 + k*( (k^m - 1) / (k-1) )\n\nBut note: the entire expression is the geometric series.\n\nAnother idea: for a fixed n, we can consider that the snowflake must have at least 3 layers (if we count the center as layer0, then we have layer1 and layer2). Then the minimal n is 1+k+k^2.\n\nBut note: the condition on k: k must be an integer greater than 1.\n\nWe can try to solve for k in terms of n and m. However, n can be huge (up to 10^18) and m can be up to about 60 (since 2^60 is around 1e18). But we don't know m.\n\nAlternatively, note that the equation:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\ncan be rewritten as:\n\nn = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\nThen, k^(m+1) = n*(k-1) + 1.\n\nBut we don't know k and m.\n\nBut note: for a fixed m (say m=2, then n = 1+k+k^2, so k^2 + k + (1-n)=0, then k = (-1+sqrt(1+4*(n-1))) / 2. Then we check if the discriminant is a perfect square and the root is an integer >1.\n\nSimilarly, for m=3: n = 1+k+k^2+k^3, then k^3 + k^2 + k + (1-n)=0. We can solve for k by iterating? But n can be up to 10^18.\n\nBut note: the exponent m is at least 2 (so two expansions) and the base k is at least 2. The maximum m we need to consider: since k>=2, then the maximum m is about floor(log2(n)) but we can set an upper bound: for example, if m=2, then n = 1+k+k^2, and k is roughly sqrt(n). For m=3, k is roughly cube root of n, etc.\n\nBut we cannot iterate over all m from 2 up to, say, 60 (because 2^60 is huge) for each test case (and t up to 10000) because 10000*60 = 600000, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python we need to be cautious. However, the problem says n can be up to 10^18, and the base k might be very close to 2 for large exponents.\n\nBut note: the equation for a fixed m is:\n\nk^m < n <= k^(m+1)   (but actually the geometric series is (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1))\n\nAlternatively, we can fix m (from 2 up to, say, 60) and then solve for k.\n\nBut note: we can also consider that the number of layers (exponents) is small because even for base 2, the exponent m+1 is about 60 (since 2^60 ~ 1e18). So we can iterate m from 2 to 60 (inclusive) and for each m, try to find an integer k>1 such that:\n\n(k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) = n\n\nBut wait, we can also fix the base k? Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\nWe know that for a fixed m, we have:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\nThen, we can write:\n\nk^m <= n <= (k+1)^{m}   ??? Not exactly.\n\nBut note: the equation is:\n\nn = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nWe can also express k as:\n\nk is the base of a geometric series that sums to n.\n\nWe can solve for k by considering that k must be at least 2 and at most n-1 (but actually much smaller). However, we can use binary search for k for a fixed m? But then we have 10000 test cases and m from 2 to 60, and for each m and each test case we do a binary search for k? That would be too slow.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can consider that the equation for a fixed m is:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\nThen, k^m <= n < (k+1)^(m+1) doesn't hold.\n\nBut note: the series is increasing with k. For a fixed m, we can compute k by taking the (m)-th root of n (approximately). Then we can check the two bases around that root.\n\nBut note: we have:\n\nk^m <= n - 1 - (k + k^2 + ... )? \n\nActually, we can write:\n\nn = 1 + k*(1 + k*(1 + ... ))   (m times)\n\nBut we can use the fact that:\n\nk^m <= n <= (k+1)^(m+1)   ??? Not directly.\n\nAlternatively, we can solve for k in the equation:\n\nn = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nBut note: k is an integer, so we can try to find k by solving the equation:\n\nk^(m+1) = n*(k-1)+1\n\nBut that is a polynomial equation of degree m+1, which is too high.\n\nBut note: m is at most 60, and k is at least 2. We can instead express:\n\nWe know that k must satisfy:\n\nk^m <= n   (because the largest term is k^m)\n\nand\n\nn < (k+1)^(m+1)  ??? Not necessarily.\n\nBut we can use the following: for a fixed m, the minimal n for base k is 1+k+k^2+...+k^m, so we want to find k such that:\n\nS(k, m) = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) = n\n\nWe can solve for k by iterating k from 2 to the m-th root of n (plus a little). But the m-th root of n (for n=10^18 and m=2) is about 10^9, which is too many to iterate.\n\nAnother idea: we can use the fact that k must be an integer and use the equation:\n\nn = 1 + k*(1 + k*(1 + ... ))   (m times)\n\nWe can define a function f(k, m) = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m.\n\nBut note: m is fixed (from 2 to 60). For a given m, we can find k by binary searching in the range [2, n] (but n is huge). However, note that k is at least 2 and at most around n^(1/m). Since m>=2, the maximum k we need to consider is about n^(1/2) (if m=2) and n^(1/60) (if m=60) which is about 10^(18/60) ~ 10^0.3 ~ 2, so for m=60, k is at most 2? \n\nWait, for m=60: \nIf k=2, then n = (2^61-1)/1 = 2^61-1, which is about 2e18. So for n=10^18, k=2 would give about 2^61-1 ~ 2e18, which is larger than 10^18. So for n=10^18, we can only consider k=2 for m=60? Actually, we can consider k=2 for m=59: n=(2^60-1) = 1.15e18, which is less than 10^18, and k=2 for m=60: 2^61-1 ~ 2.3e18, which is more. So for m=60, we only need to check k=2? \n\nBut note: the equation for m=60: n = (k^61-1)/(k-1). We need to check k=2: 2^61-1 is about 2.3e18, so if n=10^18, then k=2 is too big. Then we check k=1? but k>1. So no solution for m=60 and n=10^18.\n\nBut how to check without iterating k from 2 to n^(1/m) (which for m=2 and n=10^18 is 10^9, too many)?\n\nWe can use the following: for fixed m, we can use binary search on k (base) to find if there exists an integer k>=2 such that S(k, m) = n.\n\nBut note: S(k, m) is strictly increasing with k. So we can set:\n\nlow = 2\nhigh = n  (but we can set a better high: the m-th root of n plus one? Actually, the largest term is k^m, so k^m <= n, so k <= n^(1/m). \n\nBut n^(1/m) for m=2 is sqrt(n) which is 1e9, and for m=3 is 1e6, and for m=60 is around 2 (as above). \n\nBut note: we are iterating m from 2 to 60. For each test case, we would iterate m from 2 to 60 and for each m, we do a binary search for k in [2, floor(n^(1/m))+1]. The total operations per test case would be 59 * (log2(floor(n^(1/m)))) which is acceptable because the exponents m are large and the interval for k is small (especially for large m). However, the worst-case for m=2: the interval length is 10^9, and binary search takes about 30 iterations. Then for m=3: 10^6^(1/3) is 100, so 7 iterations. Then for m=4: 10^18^(1/4) is 10^4.5 ~ 31622, so about 15 iterations. Then m=5: 10^18^(1/5) ~ 10^3.6 ~ 1000, so 10 iterations. And for m>=60, the interval is very small (only 2 or 3 numbers).\n\nBut the total iterations per test case: sum_{m=2}^{60} (number of binary search steps) is about 30 (for m=2) + 7 (m=3) + 15 (m=4) + 10 (m=5) + ... and then decreases rapidly. The total number of iterations per test case is about 60 * (average 10) = 600, and then multiplied by 10000 test cases: 6e6, which is acceptable in Python.\n\nBut wait, the problem says t up to 10000. 10000 * 600 = 6e6, which is acceptable.\n\nBut note: n can be as large as 10^18, and for m=2 we do a binary search from 2 to 10^9, which is 30 steps. Then for each step, we compute S(k, m) which is the geometric series sum. How do we compute that? We can compute k^m (the last term) and then the sum is (k^(m+1)-1)//(k-1). But note: k and m can be such that k^m is very big (for k=10^9 and m=2: (10^9)^2 = 10^18, which is the limit of n, but we are representing n as a Python integer, so that's okay). But we have to be careful with the computation: we are doing (k^(m+1)-1)//(k-1). For k=10^9 and m=2: we need to compute k^3 which is 10^27, which is too big for integers? Actually, 10^27 is an integer in Python but might be slow and use a lot of memory.\n\nBut note: we are only doing 10000 test cases, and for each test case we do 60 iterations (m from 2 to 60) and for each m we do about 30 binary search steps (for m=2). The total number of geometric series computations is 10000 * 60 * (number of binary search steps). For m=2, each binary search step does a computation of the geometric series for base k and exponent m+1 (which is 3). But wait, for m=2, we need the series of 3 terms: 1+k+k^2. We can compute that without computing k^3? Actually, we can compute:\n\nS = 1 + k + k*k\n\nBut wait, the formula is for m+1 terms: from k^0 to k^m. For m=2, we have 3 terms: k^0, k^1, k^2. So we can compute:\n\nS = (k**(m+1)-1)//(k-1)   # but k**(m+1) might be too big for k=10^9 and m=2: k^3 = 1e27, which is acceptable in Python? Yes, because 10^27 is an integer that Python can handle, but it might be slow for 3e6 such computations (each one is a big exponentiation). \n\nAlternatively, we can avoid using the closed-form formula and compute the series iteratively. But the series has m+1 terms, and m is at most 60, so we can compute:\n\ntotal = 1\nterm = 1\nfor i in range(1, m+1):\n    term *= k\n    total += term\n\nBut then we are doing a loop of m (at most 60) for each candidate k. And we have 10000 test cases * 60 (m from 2 to 60) * (about 30 binary search steps for m=2) * 60 (the inner loop) -> 10000 * 60 * 30 * 60 = 10000 * 1080000 = 10.8e9, which is too slow.\n\nBut wait, we are not iterating k from 2 to n^(1/m) (which is too many). We are doing binary search for k in the range [2, n^(1/m)] for each fixed m. The number of k candidates per m is logarithmic (base 2) in the length of the interval. The interval length for m=2 is 10^9, so about 30 k candidates. Then for each candidate k, we compute the geometric series sum by a loop of m (which is at most 60). So for m=2, we do 30 * 60 = 1800 operations per test case for m=2. Then for m=3, the interval length is about 10^6^(1/3)=100, so 7 candidates, and each candidate does a loop of 3 (m+1=4? Actually, we compute the series for m+1 terms, so for m=3 we do 4 terms, so 4 operations per candidate). Then total for m=3: 7 * 4 = 28.\n\nBut wait, we are iterating m from 2 to 60. The worst-case is m=2, which gives 30 * (m+1) = 30 * 3 = 90 operations per test case for m=2. Then for m=3: 7 * 4 = 28. Then m=4: the interval length is about 31622, so about 15 candidates, and each candidate does 5 terms: 15*5=75. \n\nThen the total operations per test case is the sum_{m=2}^{60} (number_of_candidates(m) * (m+1)).\n\nBut note: the number_of_candidates(m) is floor(log2(interval_length(m))) + 1, where interval_length(m) = floor(n^(1/m)) (or we can set high = int(round(n**(1/m)))+2). \n\nBut note: n can be as large as 10^18, so for m=2: interval_length = floor(sqrt(10^18)) = 10^9, so log2(10^9) is about 30, so 31 candidates (binary search steps). Then 31 * 3 = 93.\n\nFor m=3: interval_length = floor(10^18^(1/3)) = 10^6, so log2(10^6) is about 20, so 21 * 4 = 84.\n\nBut wait, we are not iterating over all k from 2 to n^(1/m), we are doing binary search, so the number of candidates (midpoints) is about log2(interval_length). \n\nBut then the total operations per test case is the sum_{m=2}^{60} (log2(interval_length(m)) * (m+1)).\n\nNow, the interval_length(m) = floor(n^(1/m)) is decreasing as m increases. The maximum m for which n^(1/m) >=2 is about 60 (since 10^18^(1/60) is about 2). \n\nWe can compute for each m from 2 to 60:\n\nLet L = floor(n^(1/m))   (we can approximate by n**(1/m))\n\nThen the number of binary search steps is about floor(log2(L)) + 1.\n\nThen the operations for this m is (floor(log2(L)) + 1) * (m+1)\n\nThen we do that for all m from 2 to 60.\n\nBut note: for large m (like m=60), the interval_length is very small (maybe 2 or 3), so log2(L) is small (like 1 or 2). \n\nBut we have 10000 test cases. We need to check if the total operations (over all test cases) is acceptable.\n\nFirst, let's compute the worst-case for a single test case (n=10^18):\n\nFor m=2: log2(10^9) is about 30, so 30 * 3 = 90\nFor m=3: log2(10^6) is about 20, so 20 * 4 = 80\nFor m=4: log2(10^4.5) is about 15, so 15 * 5 = 75\nFor m=5: log2(10^3.6) is about 12, so 12 * 6 = 72\nFor m=6: log2(10^3) is about 10, so 10 * 7 = 70\nFor m=7: log2(10^(18/7)) ~ 10^2.56 ~ 360, so log2(360) is about 9, so 9*8=72\nFor m=8: 10^(18/8)=10^2.25 ~ 177, log2(177)~7.8, so 8*9=",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting from a central vertex and expanding outward in a geometric series manner. The key insight is that the total number of vertices in such a graph must be expressible as a geometric series sum \\( 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^m \\) for some integer \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( m \\geq 2 \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The snowflake graph starts with one central vertex. In each subsequent step (at least one step after the initial expansion), every vertex with degree 1 is expanded by adding \\( k \\) new vertices. This results in a graph where the total number of vertices forms a geometric series: \\( n = 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^m \\). The challenge is to check if \\( n \\) can be written in this form for some \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( m \\geq 2 \\).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For a given \\( n \\), we need to check if there exists an integer \\( k > 1 \\) and an integer \\( m \\geq 2 \\) such that \\( n = \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\). This equation can be rewritten as \\( k^{m+1} = n(k - 1) + 1 \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each test case, we iterate over possible values of \\( m \\) (from 2 up to a reasonable upper limit, say 60, since \\( 2^{60} \\) is around \\( 10^{18} \\)). For each \\( m \\), we perform a binary search to find an integer \\( k > 1 \\) such that the geometric series sum equals \\( n \\). The binary search is conducted over the range \\([2, \\lfloor n^{1/m} \\rfloor]\\).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: For each test case, we check up to 59 values of \\( m \\). For each \\( m \\), the binary search involves logarithmically many steps (around 30 for \\( m = 2 \\)) and each step computes the geometric series sum in linear time relative to \\( m \\). Given the constraints \\( n \\leq 10^{18} \\) and \\( t \\leq 10^4 \\), the total operations are manageable (approximately \\( 10^4 \\times 59 \\times 30 \\times 60 \\)), which is feasible for modern computing.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef can_form_snowflake(n):\n    if n < 7:\n        return False\n        \n    max_m = 60\n    found = False\n    for m in range(2, max_m + 1):\n        low = 2\n        high = n\n        candidate_k = None\n        \n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            total = 1\n            term = 1\n            for _ in range(m):\n                term *= mid\n                total += term\n                if total > n:\n                    break\n                    \n            if total == n:\n                candidate_k = mid\n                break\n            elif total < n:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n                \n        if candidate_k is not None:\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    return found\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(data[0])\n    out_lines = []\n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        if n < 7:\n            out_lines.append(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if can_form_snowflake(n):\n                out_lines.append(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                out_lines.append(\"NO\")\n                \n    sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(out_lines))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function `can_form_snowflake`**: This function checks if \\( n \\) can be expressed as a geometric series sum \\( 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^m \\) for some \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( m \\geq 2 \\). It iterates over possible values of \\( m \\) (from 2 to 60) and performs a binary search for \\( k \\) in the range \\([2, n^{1/m}]\\). For each \\( m \\), it calculates the sum of the geometric series up to \\( k^m \\) and checks if it matches \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Main Function**: The main function reads input values, processes each test case by calling `can_form_snowflake`, and outputs \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on the result. It handles up to \\( 10^4 \\) test cases efficiently, leveraging the binary search approach to minimize computation time.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the feasibility of forming a snowflake graph for large values of \\( n \\) by leveraging geometric series properties and binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
