He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem:\n\n We are given two tokens in the first line: a and b. \n   - a is an integer base (2 <= a <= 25)\n   - b can be either an integer (same constraints) or the letter 'R'\n\n Then we are given a string c which is a non-negative integer in base a (with possible leading zeros, but length <= 1000). The number is guaranteed to be representable.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Convert the given string c (which is in base a) to an integer in base 10.\n    Since the string may have leading zeros, we can use int(c, base=a) but note: the base a is between 2 and 25, and the digits might include letters? However, the problem says \"the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\" only if not Roman, but when Roman is included the number is at most 300010 and non-zero.\n\n    But note: the input string c is in base a. The digits allowed in base a (from 2 to 25) are:\n        If a <= 10: digits 0 to a-1 (but note: the example includes base 16 and uses 'A' for 10, so we must consider that the string might contain letters up to 'Z'? Actually, the problem says: \"In bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" and the base a is from 2 to 25, so we might have bases up to 25.\n\n    However, the input string for base a will only use digits that are valid for base a. The digits can be from '0' to '9' and then from 'A' to the required letter (if base > 10). But note: the problem says the string may contain leading zeros.\n\n    But wait: the input format says \"a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros\", and the example includes base 16 with digit 'A'.\n\n    How to convert? We can use a function that converts a string from base a (with digits represented by 0-9 and then A-Z) to a base 10 integer.\n\n    Example: \n        \"10 2\\n1\" -> base 10 integer 1 in base 2 is 1.\n        \"16 R\\n5\" -> base 16 integer '5' is 5 in base 10, then convert to base b (which is 'R').\n\n    Steps for conversion from base a to base 10:\n\n        Let s = the string.\n\n        For each character in s:\n            if the character is between '0' and '9', then value = int(char)\n            else, value = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n\n        Then, the base 10 value is: sum( digit * (a ** exponent) ) from left to right? Actually, we process from left to right as the most significant digit.\n\n        But note: the string might have leading zeros.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use: \n            n = 0\n            for char in s:\n                n = n * a + digit_value(char)\n\n    However, there's a catch: the problem says the number might be very long (up to 1000 digits) and base a can be up to 25. So the number in base 10 could be very large (like 25^1000) which is too big for standard integers? \n\n    But note: the problem says that when it's Roman, the number is at most 300010 (so we don't have to worry about huge numbers in that case). In any other case (non-Roman) the number is at most 10^15^10? Actually, the note says \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\", but wait, that is written as 10**15**10 which is a googolplexian, but that is too big to handle as an integer in base 10.\n\n    However, wait: the problem says \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 1000\". And then:\n\n        - If b is R, then the number (in base 10) is at most 300010 (and not zero).\n        - Otherwise, the number (in base 10) is at most 10^15^10? That is 10^(15^10) which is astronomically huge.\n\n    But note: the problem also says that in any other case (i.e., when b is an integer) the number (meaning the base 10 representation) won't be greater than 10^15^10? Actually, the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\".\n\n    However, wait: the input number is given in base a. The base a is at most 25, and the string length is at most 1000. The maximum value in base a (with 1000 digits) is (a^1000 - 1). For a=25, that is 25^1000 which is way bigger than 10^15^10? Actually, 10^15^10 is 10^(15*10)=10^150, and 25^1000 = (5^2)^1000 = 5^2000, which is much bigger than 10^150 (since 5^2000 = (10 * log10(5))^2000 ~ (10^0.69897)^2000 ~ 10^(1397.94) which is less than 10^1500, but wait: actually 5^2000 is about 10^1398. Similarly, 25^1000 = (5^2)^1000 = 5^2000, so same thing). However, the problem says that if not Roman, the number (the base 10 integer) is <= 10^15^10? Or is that a typo?\n\n    Let me re-read: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\"\n\n    Actually, the problem says: \"the next line contains ... It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10.\"\n\n    This seems to mean that the base 10 integer we get from converting the string is at most 10^15^10 (which is 10**(15**10)) for the non-Roman cases. But 10**15**10 is 10^(15**10) = 10^10737418240, which is way too big to handle with standard integers.\n\n    However, note the problem says: \"the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\". But wait, the input string has at most 1000 digits and base a at most 25. The maximum value we can get is (a^1000 - 1). For a=25, 25^1000 is about 10^1398 (as above). 10^1398 is less than 10^10737418240, so the condition holds. But wait, the condition says the number (base 10) is <= 10^15^10? That is a very loose bound.\n\n    However, the issue is: how to represent such a huge number? We cannot convert the entire string to base 10 as an integer because 10^15^10 is too big (it has 10^10 digits). But wait: 10^15^10 is 10^(15^10) which is a 1 followed by 15^10 zeros, and 15^10 is 576650390625, so the number of digits is 576650390626, which is impossible to store as an integer.\n\n    But note: the problem says \"the number\" (the base 10 integer) is at most 10^15^10. However, the input string is at most 1000 digits. So the maximum base 10 integer we can get is (a^1000 - 1). For a=25, that's about 10^1398, which is way less than 10^15^10. Therefore, the condition for non-Roman cases is automatically satisfied? Or is it that the input string represents a number that is at most 10^15^10? Actually, the input string is in base a (at most 25) and has at most 1000 digits, so the maximum value is 25^1000, which is about 10^1398, and 10^1398 is less than 10^15^10 (since 1398 < 10^15^10). So the guarantee is redundant? \n\n    Actually, the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\".\n\n    This means that for non-Roman, the base 10 integer we get is <= 10^15^10. But since our base 10 integer is at most 25^1000 (about 10^1398) and 10^1398 < 10^15^10, we are safe.\n\n    However, wait: 10^15^10 is 10^(15^10) = 10^576650390625, which is a 1 followed by 576650390625 zeros. Our maximum base 10 integer is about 10^1398, which is way smaller. So the condition is just telling us that the input is not arbitrarily huge? Actually, the condition for non-Roman is automatically satisfied by the input constraints (because the input string length is 1000 and base 25 gives 25^1000, which is less than 10^576650390625). So we don't have to worry.\n\n    But wait: what if the base is 2 and the string has 1000 digits? Then the maximum value is 2^1000, which is about 10^300, still less than 10^15^10.\n\n    So we can safely convert the string to base 10 as an integer.\n\n    However, note: the base 10 integer for non-Roman cases is bounded by 10^15^10, but our conversion method using base 10 integer arithmetic would require handling numbers up to 10^15^10, which is impossible because 10^15^10 is way beyond what Python integers can handle (Python integers are arbitrary precision, but the memory and time would be too high for such a huge exponent).\n\n    But wait, the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\". However, the input string is at most 1000 digits and base a at most 25, so the base 10 integer is at most 25^1000, which is around 10^1398, and that is acceptable because 10^1398 is a number with about 1399 digits, which is manageable.\n\n    Why did they say \"10^15^10\"? Maybe they meant 10^15 (i.e., 1e15) and not 10^15^10? Or perhaps it was a typo. Because 10^15^10 is an extremely huge number, and the input string (with 1000 digits in base 25) is only up to 10^1398. \n\n    Let me check the problem statement again: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\".\n\n    This is ambiguous. But note: the problem says \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 1000\".\n\n    So the input string is at most 1000 digits. The maximum value in base 10 is (a^1000 - 1). For a=25, 25^1000 is about 10^1398. The bound 10^15^10 is 10^(15^10) which is 10^576650390625, which is way bigger. So the condition is redundant.\n\n    However, to be safe, we must consider: if the base 10 integer we compute is too large (like more than 10^15^10) then we cannot represent it as an integer? But wait, the condition says the number (in base 10) is at most 10^15^10, so we don't have to worry about numbers larger than that.\n\n    But note: the condition is for non-Roman cases. In Roman cases, the base 10 integer is at most 300010, so we can handle those easily.\n\n    So plan:\n\n    Step 1: Parse the first line. Split into tokens. There will be two tokens: the first is a (integer), the second is either an integer or 'R'. But note: the base b can be from 2 to 25, and the input says \"Only b may be replaced by an R\", so we have two possibilities.\n\n    Step 2: Read the next line, which is the string c.\n\n    Step 3: Convert the string c from base a to a base 10 integer.\n\n    Step 4: If b is 'R', then convert the base 10 integer to a Roman numeral (using the standard rules). But note: the problem says the number is at least 1 and at most 300010.\n\n    Step 5: Else (b is an integer between 2 and 25), convert the base 10 integer to base b.\n\n    However, note: the base 10 integer we got might be 0. But the problem says: if Roman, then the number is not zero. For non-Roman, the input can be zero? The problem says non-negative integer, and the example includes '1'. But the problem says: \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a\", and then the guarantee for Roman is that it is not zero and <=300010.\n\n    So for non-Roman, we might have zero? But note: the problem says \"non-negative\", so zero is allowed. Then we output nothing? Actually, the problem says: \"You must omit leading zeros\", so if the number is 0, then the output should be \"0\" (unless the base is R and the number is 0, but that case is excluded by the problem).\n\n    However, the problem says: \"Write a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\"\n\n    So if the number is 0, then in base b (if b is integer) we output \"0\". But note: the problem says for Roman, the number is not zero. So we don't have to worry about zero in Roman.\n\n    But wait, the input string for base a might be \"0\" (with one digit). Then we convert to base 10: 0. Then we have to output 0 in base b (if b is integer). But if b is R, then we skip because the guarantee says the number is not zero.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros\", so \"0\" is a valid input.\n\n    Steps:\n\n    1. Read a and b.\n    2. Read the string s.\n\n    3. Convert s from base a to a base 10 integer.\n\n        We need to define a function: base_a_to_10(s, a)\n\n        How to do that:\n\n            digits = []\n            for char in s:\n                if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                    d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n                else:\n                    d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n                # But note: the digit must be less than the base a?\n                # According to the problem, the string is valid, so every digit is in [0, a-1] (if a<=10, then digits are 0-9, but if a>10, then digits are 0-9 and then A to (a-10-1)th letter? But note: the base a is at most 25, so the highest digit is 24, which is represented by 'O' (since 10->'A'=10, 11->'B'=11, ... 24->'O'=24). However, the input string may use digits beyond '9' only if base a > 10.\n\n            Then, we can use:\n\n                num = 0\n                for char in s:\n                    d = int(char) if char in '0123456789' else (ord(char) - ord('A') + 10)\n                    num = num * a + d\n\n            But wait: if the string is \"0\" then we return 0.\n\n        However, note: the string might have leading zeros. This conversion naturally handles leading zeros.\n\n    4. Now, if b is 'R':\n\n        Convert the base10 integer (n) to a Roman numeral.\n\n        Steps for Roman conversion:\n\n            We know n is between 1 and 300010.\n\n            We can use a list of tuples for the Roman numerals, from largest to smallest.\n\n            Standard Roman numerals:\n\n                M: 1000\n                CM: 900\n                D: 500\n                CD: 400\n                C: 100\n                XC: 90\n                L: 50\n                XL: 40\n                X: 10\n                IX: 9\n                V: 5\n                IV: 4\n                I: 1\n\n            We'll create a list of (value, symbol) in descending order.\n\n            Then, while n > 0:\n                for each (value, sym) in the list:\n                    if n >= value:\n                        append sym * (n // value)\n                        n -= value * (n // value)\n\n            But note: we must follow the subtractive principle.\n\n        Example: \n            n=5 -> V\n            n=4 -> IV\n            n=9 -> IX\n            n=40 -> XL\n            n=90 -> XC\n            n=400 -> CD\n            n=900 -> CM\n\n        Let's define the list:\n\n            roman_numerals = [\n                (1000, 'M'),\n                (900, 'CM'),\n                (500, 'D'),\n                (400, 'CD'),\n                (100, 'C'),\n                (90, 'XC'),\n                (50, 'L'),\n                (40, 'XL'),\n                (10, 'X'),\n                (9, 'IX'),\n                (5, 'V'),\n                (4, 'IV'),\n                (1, 'I')\n            ]\n\n    5. Else (b is integer):\n\n        Convert the base10 integer n to base b.\n\n        But note: the base b is between 2 and 25. The digits in base b: \n            If b <= 10: digits are 0 to b-1, represented by '0' to str(b-1)\n            If b > 10: digits from 0 to 9 and then A to (b-10-1)th letter (so 10->'A', 11->'B', ... up to 24->'O')\n\n        Steps:\n\n            if n == 0:\n                return \"0\"\n\n            digits = []\n            while n:\n                r = n % b\n                digits.append(r)\n                n //= b\n\n            Then reverse the digits and map each digit to the corresponding character.\n\n            Mapping: \n                if digit < 10: str(digit)\n                else: chr(ord('A') + digit - 10)\n\n        But note: the problem says omit leading zeros, and this algorithm for base conversion naturally produces the correct representation without leading zeros.\n\n    However, note: the base conversion algorithm for base b must work for base 2 and above, and the digits are non-negative.\n\n    But wait: what if n is 0? Then the while loop doesn't run and we get an empty list. So we should handle n==0 separately.\n\n    Also, note: the base 10 integer n we got might be 0, and then we output \"0\".\n\n    But the problem says: for Roman, n is not zero, so we don't have to handle n=0 in Roman.\n\n    Example inputs:\n\n        Input: \"10 2\\n1\" -> a=10, b=2, string=\"1\"\n            base10: 1\n            base2: \"1\"\n\n        Input: \"16 R\\n5\" -> a=16, b='R', string=\"5\"\n            base10: 5\n            Roman: \"V\"\n\n        Input: \"5 R\\n4\" -> a=5, b='R', string=\"4\"\n            base10: 4\n            Roman: \"IV\"\n\n        Input: \"2 2\\n1111001\" -> a=2, b=2, string=\"1111001\"\n            base10: 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64+32+16+8+1 = 121\n            base2: 121 in base2 is '1111001' (since 121 is 128-7, but let's compute: \n                    121 //2 = 60 remainder 1\n                    60//2=30 r0\n                    30//2=15 r0\n                    15//2=7 r1\n                    7//2=3 r1\n                    3//2=1 r1\n                    1//2=0 r1 -> so reading remainders backwards: 1111001 -> but wait, the input was \"1111001\", so that's the same.\n\n        Input: \"12 13\\nA\" -> a=12, b=13, string=\"A\"\n            base10: A in base12 is 10.\n            base13: 10 in base13 is 'A'\n\n    Implementation details:\n\n        We'll write helper functions:\n\n        def base_a_to_10(s, a):\n            # s is string, a is base (2<=a<=25)\n            num = 0\n            for char in s:\n                if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                    d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n                else:\n                    d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n                # Check if d is less than a? The problem guarantees valid input, but let's assume it's valid.\n                num = num * a + d\n            return num\n\n        However, note: the input string might have negative signs? The problem doesn't say, but the example only has positive. And the problem says non-negative. So we don't have negative.\n\n        But wait: the problem says \"non-negative\", so no negatives.\n\n        Then, for the Roman conversion:\n\n        def to_roman(n):\n            # n is integer between 1 and 300010\n            roman_numerals = [\n                (1000, 'M'),\n                (900, 'CM'),\n                (500, 'D'),\n                (400, 'CD'),\n                (100, 'C'),\n                (90, 'XC'),\n                (50, 'L'),\n                (40, 'XL'),\n                (10, 'X'),\n                (9, 'IX'),\n                (5, 'V'),\n                (4, 'IV'),\n                (1, 'I')\n            ]\n            res = ''\n            for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n                while n >= value:\n                    res += symbol\n                    n -= value\n            return res\n\n        But wait, the above code for Roman is not efficient because we are subtracting the value multiple times. We can do:\n\n            roman_numerals = [\n                (1000, 'M'),\n                (900, 'CM'),\n                (500, 'D'),\n                (400, 'CD'),\n                (100, 'C'),\n                (90, 'XC'),\n                (50, 'L'),\n                (40, 'XL'),\n                (10, 'X'),\n                (9, 'IX'),\n                (5, 'V'),\n                (4, 'IV'),\n                (1, 'I')\n            ]\n\n            res = ''\n            for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n                count = n // value\n                res += symbol * count\n                n -= value * count\n            return res\n\n        But note: the standard subtractive principle requires that we don't use more than 3 of the same symbol. The above works because the list goes from largest to smallest and we subtract the largest possible values first.\n\n        Example: 1994: \n            M (1000) -> 1*M, then 994\n            CM (900) -> 1*CM, then 94\n            XC (90) -> 1*XC, then 4\n            XL? No, we don't have XL for 40, but wait: 94 -> after CM, we have 94: then we use XC (90) then 4, so we use XL? Actually, 94: \n                After M, then CM (900) then XC (90) then IV (4) -> MCMXIV? \n            But 1994 is MCMXCIV? Actually, 1994 is MCMXCIV? Let me check: \n                M (1000) -> 1000\n                CM (900) -> 900 -> total 1900\n                XC (90) -> 90 -> 1990\n                IV (4) -> 4 -> 1994\n            So the expected result is \"MCMXCIV\", but wait:\n\n            Using the list:\n\n                Start with 1994:\n                M: 1994//1000 = 1, then 1994-1000=994 -> \"M\"\n                Then CM: 994//900=1, then 994-900=94 -> \"MCM\"\n                Then XC: 94//90=1, then 94-90=4 -> \"MCMXC\"\n                Then IV: 4//4=1, then 4-4=0 -> \"MCMXCV\"?\n\n            Wait, no: we have IV (4) and I (1). The list has (5, 'V') and (4, 'IV') and (1, 'I'). So for 4, we use IV.\n\n            But the above code does:\n\n                for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n                    count = n // value\n                    res += symbol * count\n                    n -= value * count\n\n            So for 4: \n                We have a tuple (4, 'IV'): so we use 4//4 = 1, then subtract 4, so we add \"IV\".\n\n            But then the code uses the next tuple (1, 'I') for the remaining 0, so no more.\n\n            So the result is \"MCMXCIV\".\n\n            However, the standard representation for 1994 is \"MCMXCIV\", which is correct.\n\n            But wait: the example in the problem: \n                Input: \"5 R\\n4\" -> output \"IV\"\n\n            So that matches.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we are safe.\n\n    But wait: the Roman numeral for 4 is \"IV\", and the above code uses the tuple (4, 'IV') so we don't use the tuple (5, 'V') and (1, 'I') for 4. This is correct.\n\n    Now, the base conversion for base b (integer) must handle:\n\n        Example: base 16 to base 10, then base 10 to base 16 (for example, \"A\" in base16 is 10, then 10 in base16 is \"A\")\n\n        Steps:\n\n            def base10_to_base_b(n, b):\n                if n == 0:\n                    return \"0\"\n                digits = []\n                while n:\n                    n, r = divmod(n, b)\n                    digits.append(r)\n                # Now, we have the digits in reverse order (least significant first)\n                # Then we map each digit to a character.\n                mapping = []\n                for i in range(b):\n                    if i < 10:\n                        mapping.append(str(i))\n                    else:\n                        mapping.append(chr(ord('A') + i - 10))\n                # But wait, we built mapping for digits 0 to b-1.\n                # However, note: the remainders are from 0 to b-1, and we want to output from most significant to least.\n\n                # But we have the digits in reverse order (last remainder is the most significant). So we need to reverse the digits list.\n\n                # Actually, we are building the digits from least significant to most, so we need to reverse the list to get the most significant first.\n\n                # But wait: the while loop: \n                #   n = 121, b=2\n                #   first iteration: n=121, r=121%2=1, then n=60\n                #   then r=0, then 30, then 1, then 1, then 0, then 1.\n                #   digits becomes [1,0,0,1,1,1,1] and then we reverse to [1,1,1,1,0,0,1] -> but that's not 121 in base2.\n\n                # Actually, 121 in base2 is 1111001, which is 7 digits. Our list is [1,0,0,1,1,1,1] and then reversed is [1,1,1,1,0,0,1] -> which is correct.\n\n                # But note: we are popping the remainders in the order of least significant to most. Then we reverse to get the correct order.\n\n                # Alternatively, we can build the string by:\n\n                #   s = ''\n                #   while n:\n                #       s = (mapping[r]) + s\n                #       n //= b   (or n, r = divmod(n, b))\n\n                # But the above method is simpler.\n\n                # However, the above method with list appending and then reversing is standard.\n\n                # But note: the problem says the base10 integer n might be 0, so we handled that separately.\n\n                # Let me test with n=0: returns \"0\", which is correct.\n\n                # Example: n=10, b=16: \n                #   digits = []\n                #   while 10: \n                #       10 //16 = 0, remainder 10 -> digits=[10]\n                #   Then we map 10 to 'A'\n                #   Then reverse digits -> [10] -> \"A\"\n\n                # Example: n=5, b=2: \n                #   digits = []\n                #   5//2=2 remainder 1 -> digits=[1]\n                #   2//2=1 remainder 0 -> digits=[1,0]\n                #   1//2=0 remainder 1 -> digits=[1,0,1] -> reverse to [1,0,1] -> \"101\"\n\n                # But wait, 5 in base2 is 101, yes.\n\n                # However, note: the example input \"2 2\\n1111001\" is 121 in base10, and we already tested that.\n\n                # But wait: the example input \"12 13\\nA\": \n                #   base_a_to_10(\"A\",12) -> 10\n                #   base10_to_base_b(10,13) -> \n                #       10 //13 = 0 remainder 10 -> digits=[10] -> then map 10 to 'A' -> \"A\"\n\n                # Correct.\n\n    However, note: the base conversion function must handle bases from 2 to 25.\n\n    But wait: what if the base is 1? The problem states base a and base b are at least 2, so we don't have to worry.\n\n    Code structure:\n\n        data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n        if not data: \n            # but there should be at least two tokens\n        a = int(data[0])\n        b_str = data[1]\n\n        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n        n = base_a_to_10(s, a)\n\n        if b_str == 'R':\n            print(to_roman(n))\n        else:\n            b = int(b_str)\n            print(base10_to_base_b(n, b))\n\n    But wait: the base_a_to_10 function must handle the string that might contain letters for bases above 10.\n\n    Let's test base_a_to_10:\n\n        Example: base 16, string \"A\" -> \n            'A': ord('A')-ord('A')+10 = 10 -> correct.\n\n        Example: base 16, string \"10\" -> \n            first digit: '1' -> 1, then 1*16 + 0 = 16.\n\n        Example: base 16, string \"B\" -> 11.\n\n    But note: the input string for base a might have digits that are not valid? The problem says the string is valid.\n\n    One more edge: base 10, string \"0\" -> 0.\n\n    However, if the base is 10 and the string is \"0\", then we return 0.\n\n    Then, if base b is an integer and n==0, we output \"0\".\n\n    But if base b is 'R', we skip because n is not zero (guaranteed).\n\n    However, what if the input string is \"0\" and base b is an integer? Then we output \"0\".\n\n    But the problem says: the next line contains a non-negative integer, so 0 is allowed.\n\n    This matches.\n\n    Let me test with the examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"10 2\\n1\" -> n=1, then base2: \"1\" -> correct.\n\n        Example 2: \"16 R\\n5\" -> n=5, then to_roman(5) -> \"V\" -> correct.\n\n        Example 3: \"5 R\\n4\" -> n=4, then to_roman(4) -> \"IV\" -> correct.\n\n        Example 4: \"2 2\\n1111001\" -> n=121, then base2: \n            base10_to_base_b(121,2): \n                digits = []\n                121 %2=1 -> digits=[1], ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, with the possibility of the target base being the Roman numeral system. The solution involves three main steps: converting the input number from its given base to base 10, handling the conversion to Roman numerals if specified, and converting from base 10 to the desired base if it's an integer.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The input number is provided as a string in a given base `a`. We convert this string to a base 10 integer by processing each digit, converting it to its numerical value, and accumulating the total value using the base `a`.\n2. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target base is 'R', we convert the base 10 integer to a Roman numeral. This involves mapping the integer to Roman symbols by subtracting the largest possible values first.\n3. **Base Conversion from Decimal**: If the target base is an integer, we convert the base 10 integer to the specified base by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders. These remainders are then mapped to their corresponding digits (0-9 and A-Z for bases beyond 10).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef base_a_to_10(s, a):\n    num = 0\n    for char in s:\n        if '0' <= char <= '9':\n            d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n        else:\n            d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * a + d\n    return num\n\ndef to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef base10_to_base_b(n, b):\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    digits = []\n    while n:\n        n, r = divmod(n, b)\n        digits.append(r)\n    mapping = []\n    for i in range(b):\n        if i < 10:\n            mapping.append(str(i))\n        else:\n            mapping.append(chr(ord('A') + i - 10))\n    res = ''.join(mapping[d] for d in reversed(digits))\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b_str = data[1]\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    n = base_a_to_10(s, a)\n    \n    if b_str == 'R':\n        print(to_roman(n))\n    else:\n        b = int(b_str)\n        print(base10_to_base_b(n, b))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The function `base_a_to_10` processes each character of the input string, converting it to its numerical value (0-9 or A-Z). It then accumulates these values into a base 10 integer by multiplying the current total by the base `a` and adding the digit's value.\n2. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: The function `to_roman` converts a base 10 integer to a Roman numeral by iterating through a list of Roman numeral values and symbols. For each value, it appends the corresponding symbol to the result string as many times as the value fits into the remaining number.\n3. **Base Conversion from Decimal**: The function `base10_to_base_b` converts a base 10 integer to another base `b` by repeatedly dividing the number by `b` and storing the remainders. These remainders are then mapped to their respective digits (0-9 or A-Z) and combined in reverse order to form the result string.\n4. **Main Function**: The `main` function reads input values, performs the necessary conversions based on the target base, and prints the result. It handles both integer and Roman numeral targets by calling the appropriate conversion functions.",
