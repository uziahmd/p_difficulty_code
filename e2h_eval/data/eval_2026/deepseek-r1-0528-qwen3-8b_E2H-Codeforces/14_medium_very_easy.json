He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeros is determined by the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of n!.\n\n The function for the number of trailing zeros in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n Now, we are asked: for a given m (number of trailing zeros), find all positive integers n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n However, note that the problem says \"exactly m zeroes\". But observe: \n   Z(n) is non-decreasing. So, we are looking for an interval [L, R] such that for all n in [L, R], Z(n) = m.\n   But note: it's possible that there is no n with Z(n)=m? Actually, the sample input m=1 returns 5 numbers (from 5 to 9). \n\n How do we approach?\n Step 1: Find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m. Let this be L0.\n Step 2: Find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1. Then the numbers we want are from L0 to (the one just before the next m+1).\n\n But note: the problem asks for the number of n (k) and then the k integers in increasing order.\n\n However, note that the trailing zeros function increases only at multiples of 5. And sometimes it jumps by more than one (e.g., 25! has two extra factors of 5).\n\n Important: We must be cautious because the problem states that m can be as large as 100000.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We can define:\n   f(n) = Z(n)\n\n We want to find all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Find the lower bound: the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Call this L.\n 2. Find the lower bound for m+1: the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1. Call this L_next.\n\n Then, the numbers n that have exactly m zeros are those in the interval [L, L_next - 1].\n\n However, note: what if there is no n such that f(n) = m? Actually, the problem states that m>=1 and the example shows that for m=1 we have n from 5 to 9.\n\n But note: the trailing zeros function is known to hit every integer value? Actually, no. There might be gaps.\n\n Example: \n   Let m=0: then n from 1 to 4 -> but m>=1 so we don't have to consider m=0.\n   For m=1: we have n from 5 to 9 (because 5! gives 1 zero, 6! also 1, ... until 14! still 1? Actually, 10! has 2 zeros. Let me check:\n\n   Actually, let's compute:\n     5! -> 1\n     6! -> 1\n     ...\n     9! -> 1\n     10! -> 2\n\n   So for m=1, n in [5,9].\n\n   But what about m=2? \n     10! -> 2\n     11! -> 2\n     12! -> 2\n     13! -> 2\n     14! -> 2\n     15! -> 3\n\n   So for m=2, n in [10,14].\n\n   However, what about m=3? \n     15! -> 3\n     16! -> 3\n     ...\n     19! -> 3\n     20! -> 4\n\n   So m=3: n in [15,19].\n\n   But wait, what if m=100000? We need to compute the bounds without iterating too much.\n\n How to compute L for a given m?\n\n   We can use binary search for the smallest n such that f(n) >= m.\n\n   Similarly, for m+1.\n\n   Then the answer is the numbers from L to L_next-1. But note: we must check that the entire interval [L, L_next-1] indeed has f(n)=m.\n\n   Why? Because f(n) is non-decreasing and we know:\n      f(L) >= m, and f(L-1) < m (if L>0). Similarly, f(L_next) >= m+1 and f(L_next-1) < m+1.\n\n   Therefore, for any n in [L, L_next-1], we have m <= f(n) < m+1, so f(n)=m.\n\n   However, note: the function f(n) is defined for n>=0 and we are considering positive integers.\n\n   But what if there is no n such that f(n) >= m? Actually, since m>=1, we know that for n=5*m (at least) we get at least m zeros. So we are safe.\n\n   However, the problem says m can be up to 100000. We must compute L and L_next without going through too many iterations.\n\n   We can use binary search for the smallest n such that f(n) >= m.\n\n   We need to set the boundaries for binary search. Note that the minimal n for which f(n) >= m is roughly 5*m (because each multiple of 5 contributes at least one zero, and we need m zeros). But sometimes we need more because of the higher powers (like 25, 125, etc). However, we can set:\n\n        low = 0\n        high = something like 5*m * 5   # because we know that n must be at least around 5*m, but sometimes we need more (like when m is big, the base is 5, then 25, etc). Alternatively, we can use a higher estimate.\n\n   Actually, we can set an upper bound: the maximum n we need to consider is when n is about 5*m, but we know that the formula for f(n) is:\n\n        f(n) = n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ...\n\n   The maximum n we need to consider for m=100000: we know that n must be at least 5*m (so 500000) but actually, because of the higher powers, we might need a little more. However, we can set high to, say, 5*m*5 (2500000) or even 5*m*10? \n\n   But note: the formula for f(n) is roughly n/4 (geometric series with ratio 1/5). So n should be about 4*m. However, we know that n must be at least 5*m (since we need at least m factors of 5, and each multiple of 5 gives one, so n>=5*m). \n\n   Actually, we can set high = 5 * m * 5   (which is 25*m) and then use binary search.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        def zeros(n):\n            count = 0\n            divisor = 5\n            while divisor <= n:\n                count += n // divisor\n                divisor *= 5\n            return count\n\n        Then, we want to find the smallest n such that zeros(n) >= m.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            low_bound = 0\n            high_bound = 5 * m * 5   # This is safe? Because zeros(5*m*5) is at least (5*m*5)//5 + (5*m*5)//25 + ... = m*5 + m*5/5 + ... which is way more than m.\n\n        Then, we do binary search between 0 and high_bound.\n\n   But note: we are asked for the number of n (k) and the list of n (which would be from L to L_next-1). However, if k is large (like for m=1, k=5) then we cannot output a list of 5 numbers when m=100000, because the range of n for m=100000 might be very large (but note: the trailing zeros function increases by one at most one step per 5 numbers, but sometimes more. However, the gap for a given m is at most 4 numbers (from n0 to n0+4, then at n0+5 the zeros jump). Actually, the gap is at most 4 because:\n\n        Suppose we are at a number n that is not divisible by 5, then the zeros remain the same until the next multiple of 5? Actually, no: the zeros increase only when we hit a multiple of 5, but sometimes more than one (like 25, 125). But note, the zeros function is constant on intervals between multiples of 5.\n\n        However, the gap between two consecutive zeros-increasing steps is 5. So the numbers that have the same zeros are consecutive numbers. But the length of the interval for a fixed m is at most 4? Actually, no: because if we start at a multiple of 5, then the next multiple of 5 is 5 away, so the numbers with the same zeros are from n0 to n0+4 (if n0 is the first number that gets m zeros, then n0+4 will still have m zeros, and n0+5 will have at least m+1 zeros). \n\n        Therefore, the gap (the consecutive n with the same zeros) is always 5 consecutive numbers? Actually, no: because sometimes the zeros jump by more than one. For example, at 25:\n\n            At 24: zeros(24) = 4 (because 24//5 = 4, 24//25=0)\n            At 25: zeros(25) = 25//5 + 25//25 = 5+1 = 6.\n\n            So from 24 to 25, the zeros jump from 4 to 6. Then the numbers 24,25: \n                24: 4 zeros\n                25: 6 zeros\n\n            So the numbers with 5 zeros? There isn't one. Similarly, 6 zeros starts at 25.\n\n        Therefore, we must be cautious: the zeros function does not necessarily take every integer value.\n\n        In fact, the zeros function is non-decreasing and the steps are by the number of factors of 5 in the added number. The step size at n is the exponent of 5 in n.\n\n        Therefore, we must first check: is there any n such that zeros(n)=m?\n\n        How? We can use the two bounds:\n\n            Let L = smallest n such that zeros(n) >= m.\n            Let L_next = smallest n such that zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\n            Then, the set of n with zeros(n)=m is [L, L_next-1] if zeros(L) == m and zeros(L_next) == m+1? Actually, we know:\n\n                zeros(L) >= m, and zeros(L-1) < m (if L>0). Similarly, zeros(L_next) >= m+1 and zeros(L_next-1) < m+1.\n\n            But note: it is possible that zeros(L) > m, then there is no n with zeros(n)=m. Similarly, if zeros(L) == m, then we have at least one.\n\n        So the condition for existence is: zeros(L) == m.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n            Step 1: Find L = smallest n with zeros(n) >= m.\n            Step 2: Find L_next = smallest n with zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\n            Then, if zeros(L) != m, then there are 0 numbers.\n            Else, the numbers are from L to L_next-1.\n\n        But note: we must check zeros(L) == m? Actually, by definition of L, zeros(L) >= m and zeros(L-1) < m. But zeros(L) could be greater than m. In that case, there is no n with zeros(n)=m.\n\n        Example: m=5. What is the smallest n with zeros(n)>=5?\n            Let's compute zeros(n) for n=20: zeros(20)=4 -> not enough.\n            n=21:4, n=22:4, n=23:4, n=24:4, n=25:6 -> so L=25.\n\n            Then zeros(25)=6 !=5. So there is no n with zeros(n)=5.\n\n        Therefore, the answer for m=5 is 0.\n\n        Now, how to compute the zeros function for n=25? We did above: 25//5=5, 25//25=1 -> total 6.\n\n        So the problem: we must output:\n\n            First line: k (the count)\n            Then, if k>0, the k integers (in increasing order)\n\n        Example: \n            Input: 1 -> Output: 5\\n5 6 7 8 9\n            Input: 5 -> Output: 0\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Read m.\n\n            If m==0: then n from 1 to 4 (but note the problem says m>=1, so we don't need to handle 0)\n\n            Steps:\n\n                L = find_lower_bound(m)   [smallest n such that zeros(n) >= m]\n                L_next = find_lower_bound(m+1)\n\n                If zeros(L) != m:\n                    print(0)\n                Else:\n                    k = L_next - L\n                    print(k)\n                    Then, if k>0, print the numbers from L to L_next-1.\n\n        But note: the range [L, L_next-1] might be very large (if m is small, then the gap is small; if m is large, the gap is still small because the zeros function increases in steps of at least 1, and the gap in n is at most 4). However, wait: the gap in n is at most 4, because:\n\n            The zeros function only increases at multiples of 5. And the next multiple of 5 is at most 4 steps away. But note: sometimes we skip several multiples (like 25, which is 5*5). However, the zeros function increases by the exponent of 5 in the number. But the gap in n for a fixed zeros value is always 4? Actually, no: the zeros function is constant for a block of 5 numbers. So the gap is 4 (from n to n+4). \n\n        But wait, the example for m=1: n from 5 to 9 -> that's 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9) -> 5 numbers. So the gap is 5 numbers, meaning the difference between the last and the first is 4 (9-5=4). \n\n        Actually, the numbers are consecutive. The length is (L_next - L) numbers.\n\n        But note: we computed L_next as the smallest n such that zeros(n) >= m+1. Then the numbers with zeros(n)=m are from L to L_next-1, inclusive. The count is (L_next - L).\n\n        However, we must ensure that we don't output too many numbers. But note: the gap (L_next - L) is at most 4? Actually, no: because if we have a jump of more than 1 in zeros, then the gap might be shorter. But the gap in n is always 4? \n\n        Let me check:\n\n            For m=1: \n                L = 5, because zeros(5)=1, zeros(4)=0.\n                L_next = smallest n with zeros(n)>=2 -> that's 10 (zeros(10)=2).\n                Then the numbers are from 5 to 9 (inclusive). That's 5 numbers.\n\n            For m=2:\n                L = 10, zeros(10)=2, zeros(9)=1 -> so L=10.\n                L_next = smallest n with zeros(n)>=3 -> 15 (zeros(15)=3)\n                Numbers: 10,11,12,13,14 -> 5 numbers.\n\n            For m=3:\n                L = 15, zeros(15)=3, zeros(14)=2 -> so L=15.\n                L_next = smallest n with zeros(n)>=4 -> 20 (zeros(20)=4)\n                Numbers: 15,16,17,18,19 -> 5 numbers.\n\n            But wait, what about m=6 (which we saw is achieved at n=25)? \n                zeros(24)=4, zeros(25)=6 -> so for m=5, we found that there's no n.\n\n            Now, for m=4:\n                We want the smallest n with zeros(n)>=4: \n                    zeros(20)=4 -> so L=20.\n                Then zeros(20)=4, so we have numbers from 20 to the next boundary (which is 25, because zeros(25)=6, so the next boundary for m+1=5 is 25? Actually, no: we are looking for zeros(n)>=5, and the smallest n for that is 25 (since zeros(24)=4, zeros(25)=6). \n\n                Then the numbers for m=4 are from 20 to 24 (inclusive). That's 5 numbers.\n\n            However, wait: what about n=20 to 24: \n                zeros(20)=4, zeros(21)=4, zeros(22)=4, zeros(23)=4, zeros(24)=4 -> correct.\n\n            Then, for m=6: \n                We want the smallest n with zeros(n)>=6: that's 25 (because zeros(24)=4, zeros(25)=6).\n                Then the next boundary: smallest n with zeros(n)>=7: \n                    zeros(25)=6, zeros(26)=6, zeros(27)=6, zeros(28)=6, zeros(29)=6, zeros(30)=7 (since 30//5=6, 30//25=1 -> 7).\n                So L_next = 30.\n\n                Then the numbers for m=6 are from 25 to 29 (inclusive): 5 numbers.\n\n            But wait, what about n=25: zeros(25)=6, n=26:6, ... n=29:6, and n=30:7. So yes, 5 numbers.\n\n            Therefore, the gap in n for a fixed m is always 5 numbers? \n\n            However, note: the gap (in terms of consecutive n) is 5 numbers, but the starting point is a multiple of 5. Then the numbers are: [n0, n0+4] (if n0 is the first n with zeros(n)=m). \n\n            But wait, in the examples, the starting point (L) is always a multiple of 5. Why?\n\n            Because the zeros function only increases at multiples of 5. So the smallest n achieving m zeros must be a multiple of 5. Then the next change is at the next multiple of 5 (which is L+5). \n\n            However, what if m=0? Then the smallest n with zeros(n)>=0 is n=0? But we are considering positive integers. Actually, the problem says positive integers. \n\n            But note: the problem says \"positive integers n\", so n>=1.\n\n            For m=0: we are not handling because m>=1.\n\n            But wait, what if m=0? According to the problem, m>=1. So we don't need to handle.\n\n            However, note: the zeros function for n=0 is 0, but we are only considering positive integers.\n\n            Therefore, we can conclude that for any m that is achieved, the set of n is an interval of consecutive integers of length 5, except for the boundaries? Actually, no: the boundaries are defined by the next multiple of 5 that causes an increase.\n\n            But note: sometimes the zeros function increases by more than one at a multiple of 5 (like 25, which adds two zeros). Then the next boundary for m+1 might be the same multiple of 5 (if m+1 is less than the jump) or the next one?\n\n            Actually, we are using the zeros function to find the next boundary (for m+1). So if m=5, we found that the smallest n with zeros(n)>=6 is 25, and then we check zeros(25)=6 !=5, so we output 0.\n\n            Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n                def zeros(n):\n                    count = 0\n                    d = 5\n                    while d <= n:\n                        count += n // d\n                        d *= 5\n                    return count\n\n                def find_lower_bound(m):\n                    # We are searching for the smallest n such that zeros(n) >= m.\n                    lo = 0\n                    hi = 5 * m * 5   # This is an overestimate; but note m>=1, so we can use this.\n\n                    while lo < hi:\n                        mid = (lo+hi)//2\n                        if zeros(mid) < m:\n                            lo = mid+1\n                        else:\n                            hi = mid\n\n                    return lo\n\n                Then, main:\n                    m = int(input().strip())\n                    L = find_lower_bound(m)\n                    L_next = find_lower_bound(m+1)\n\n                    # Check if zeros(L) == m, then the numbers are from L to L_next-1.\n                    if zeros(L) != m:\n                        print(0)\n                    else:\n                        count = L_next - L\n                        print(count)\n                        if count > 0:\n                            # We have to output the numbers from L to L_next-1, which are consecutive.\n                            # But note: if count is large, we cannot output a list of numbers (like for m=100000, the count is 5?

But if the zeros value jumps from m to m+k (k>=2) then the m values in between are missing.\n\n            So the code:\n\n                We'll write a helper function zeros(n) that counts the factors of 5 in n!.\n\n                Then, we'll write a helper function to find the smallest n such that zeros(n) >= m.\n\n                Then, we check if zeros(L) == m. If not, output 0. Otherwise, output the numbers from L to L_next-1 (which are L, L+1, ..., L_next-1).\n\n            However, note: the numbers from L to L_next-1 are consecutive. But if the gap is 5, then L_next = L+5. But wait, in the example m=4: L=20, L_next=25 -> 5 away. \n\n            But wait, what if m=0? Then we are not handling. \n\n            But note: the problem says m>=1.\n\n            However, we must consider performance: the zeros function for n=500000 (when m=100000) is:\n\n                zeros(500000) = 500000//5 + 500000//25 + 500000//125 + ... until the divisor exceeds 500000.\n\n            The while loop in zeros(n) runs about log5(n) times, which is about 7 for n=500000 (because 5^7 = 78125, 5^8=390625, 5^9=1953125 which is >500000). So 9 iterations maximum.\n\n            The binary search for L and L_next: the range is from 0 to 5*m*5, which for m=100000 is 2500000. The binary search will take about log2(2500000) which is about 22 iterations. And each iteration calls zeros(n) (which is 9 iterations). So 22*9 = 198 operations, which is acceptable.\n\n            But note: m can be up to 100000, and we are doing two binary searches (for m and m+1). So 2 * 22 * 9 = 400 operations, which is acceptable.\n\n            However, we must be cautious: what if m=0? The problem says m>=1, so we are safe.\n\n            Let's test with m=100000.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                We need to compute L = smallest n such that zeros(n) >= 100000.\n\n                We set hi = 5 * 100000 * 5 = 2500000.\n\n                Then we do binary search from 0 to 2500000.\n\n                The zeros(n) for n=2500000: \n                    = 2500000//5 + 2500000//25 + 2500000//125 + 2500000//625 + 2500000//3125 + 2500000//15625 + ... \n\n                We can compute: \n                    term1: 2500000//5 = 500000\n                    term2: 2500000//25 = 100000\n                    term3: 2500000//125 = 20000\n                    term4: 2500000//625 = 4000\n                    term5: 2500000//3125 = 800\n                    term6: 2500000//15625 = 160\n                    term7: 2500000//78125 = 32\n                    term8: 2500000//390625 = 6\n                    term9: 2500000//1953125 = 1\n                    term10: 2500000//9765625 = 0\n\n                    Sum = 500000+100000+20000+4000+800+160+32+6+1 = 624999.\n\n                So 624999 >= 100000, so the hi is set to 2500000, which is safe.\n\n            Therefore, the code is:\n\n                def zeros(n):\n                    count = 0\n                    d = 5\n                    while d <= n:\n                        count += n // d\n                        d *= 5\n                    return count\n\n                def find_lower_bound(m):\n                    lo = 0\n                    hi = 5 * m * 5   # 25*m, but if m=0 then hi=0, but m>=1 so ok.\n                    while lo < hi:\n                        mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n                        if zeros(mid) < m:\n                            lo = mid + 1\n                        else:\n                            hi = mid\n                    return lo\n\n                m_val = int(input().strip())\n                L = find_lower_bound(m_val)\n                L_next = find_lower_bound(m_val+1)\n\n                if zeros(L) != m_val:\n                    print(0)\n                else:\n                    k = L_next - L\n                    print(k)\n                    if k > 0:\n                        # We have to output the k numbers: from L to L_next-1.\n                        # But k might be 5, but what if k is 0?

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding all such integers \\( n \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is determined by the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of \\( n! \\). This can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   where each term continues until the division yields zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest integer \\( L \\) such that \\( Z(L) \\geq m \\). Similarly, we find the smallest integer \\( L_{\\text{next}} \\) such that \\( Z(L_{\\text{next}}) \\geq m + 1 \\). The integers \\( n \\) that satisfy \\( Z(n) = m \\) lie in the interval \\([L, L_{\\text{next}} - 1]\\), provided \\( Z(L) = m \\).\n\n3. **Checking Validity**: If \\( Z(L) \\neq m \\), it means there are no integers \\( n \\) with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes in their factorial, and we output 0. Otherwise, the valid integers are all numbers from \\( L \\) to \\( L_{\\text{next}} - 1 \\), inclusive.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    d = 5\n    while d <= n:\n        count += n // d\n        d *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef find_lower_bound(m):\n    lo = 0\n    hi = 5 * m * 5\n    while lo < hi:\n        mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n        if zeros(mid) < m:\n            lo = mid + 1\n        else:\n            hi = mid\n    return lo\n\ndef main():\n    m_val = int(input().strip())\n    L = find_lower_bound(m_val)\n    L_next = find_lower_bound(m_val + 1)\n    \n    if zeros(L) != m_val:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = L_next - L\n        print(k)\n        if k > 0:\n            numbers = list(range(L, L_next))\n            print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function `zeros(n)`**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the division result is zero.\n\n2. **Function `find_lower_bound(m)`**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\). The search space is between 0 and \\( 25 \\times m \\) (an upper bound derived from the problem constraints).\n\n3. **Main Function**: \n   - Reads the input value \\( m \\).\n   - Finds \\( L \\) (smallest \\( n \\) with \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\)) and \\( L_{\\text{next}} \\) (smallest \\( n \\) with \\( Z(n) \\geq m + 1 \\)).\n   - Checks if \\( Z(L) = m \\). If not, outputs 0. Otherwise, outputs the count of numbers from \\( L \\) to \\( L_{\\text{next}} - 1 \\) and lists them if the count is positive.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using binary search and leverages mathematical insights about factorial trailing zeroes to solve the problem within feasible computational limits.",
