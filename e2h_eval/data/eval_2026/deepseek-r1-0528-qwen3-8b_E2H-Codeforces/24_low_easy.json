She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n The idea is to consider that we only need to leave the tabs from l to r. The cursor starts at 'pos'. We can move the cursor (with constraints) and close tabs to the left or right.\n\n However, note that the problem allows two types of operations per second:\n  1. Move the cursor one step to the left or right (but within the current bounds [a, b] where a and b are the minimum and maximum index of unclosed tabs).\n  2. Close all tabs to the left of the cursor (if any) or all tabs to the right (if any).\n\n The goal is to minimize the seconds.\n\n Observing that we want to leave [l, r], we can break the problem into two parts: \n  - Closing all tabs to the left of l (if any)\n  - Closing all tabs to the right of r (if any)\n\n But note: the closing operations are done from the current cursor position. Also, moving the cursor might be necessary to reach a position from which we can close.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require the cursor to be in a particular tab at the end. We just need to have the tabs [l, r] remaining.\n\n Let's think about the boundaries:\n\n Case 1: If the entire segment [1, n] is already the desired segment [l, r] (i.e., if l == 1 and r == n), then we don't need to do anything -> 0 seconds.\n\n Case 2: Otherwise, we have to close some tabs. Notice that we can close either side independently, but we must be at the correct position to close.\n\n Steps:\n\n Option 1: Close the left part first, then the right part.\n  - To close the left part (all tabs < l): we need to move the cursor to a tab at or to the left of l, and then close the left part. Similarly for the right.\n\n However, note that after closing one side, the available tabs change and so does the cursor movement. But observe: the problem states that the closing operation sets the new boundaries (a and b). \n\n Actually, we can consider two independent closing operations (left and right) and we can choose the order. But note: sometimes it might be more efficient to close one side while having the cursor on the other side? However, the problem allows closing only one direction at a time.\n\n Since the problem is small (n<=100), we can try to break down the problem:\n\n Let's define:\n   left_closing_required = (pos < l) ? We need to move to the left to close? Actually, to close the left part we need to be at a tab <= l, and similarly for the right.\n\n But note: we can also move beyond the required segment and then close. However, the minimal steps would involve getting to the boundary.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n   Option A: If the desired segment [l, r] already includes the starting tab (pos) then we can close from both sides without necessarily moving the cursor to the edges first.\n\n However, let me analyze by cases:\n\n Case 1: The starting tab is within [l, r]. Then we don't need to close the tabs that are between l and r. But we still need to close the left part (if any) and the right part (if any). \n\n How to close the left part?\n   - We need to get to a tab i such that i <= l (so that we can close everything to the left of i, which would include all tabs from the current left boundary (which initially is 1) up to i-1, but note: we can only close until we have removed everything outside [l, r]).\n   - However, note: the closing operation doesn't require that we close exactly the unwanted ones. It closes everything to the left (or right) of the cursor. So if we are at a tab i (<= l) then closing the left will remove all tabs from the current left boundary (which is initially 1) to i-1. But if i is less than l, then we are leaving the tab i open (which is inside [l, r]? no, because i < l). \n\n So actually, we must be careful: we cannot close the left part until we have the cursor at a tab that is at least l? Because if we close the left part from a tab i (which is <= l), then we remove everything from the current left boundary (which is 1) to i-1. But if i < l, then we are removing up to i-1, and the tab i (which is < l) remains. Then we have to close that tab as well? \n\n Alternatively, we can think: we want to leave only [l, r]. Therefore, we must close:\n   - All tabs",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds required for Luba to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] while starting from a given tab position. The solution involves analyzing the initial conditions and determining the optimal sequence of operations (moving the cursor or closing tabs) to minimize the time taken.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires closing all tabs outside the segment [l, r]. The cursor starts at a given position `pos` within the range [1, n]. The allowed operations are moving the cursor left or right by one tab per second or closing all tabs to the left or right of the cursor in one second.\n2. **Key Insight**: The solution hinges on whether the desired segment [l, r] already includes the starting tab `pos` and whether there are any tabs outside [l, r] that need to be closed. \n3. **Cases Handling**:\n   - If the entire range [1, n] is the desired segment (i.e., `l == 1` and `r == n`), no operations are needed.\n   - If the starting tab `pos` is within [l, r], then only the tabs outside [l, r] need to be closed. The minimal steps involve moving the cursor to either end of the segment and closing the respective sides.\n   - If the starting tab is not within [l, r], additional steps are needed to move the cursor into the segment before closing the opposite side.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    pos = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    r = int(data[3])\n    \n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    if pos < l:\n        print(abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1)\n        return\n        \n    if pos > r:\n        print(abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1)\n        return\n        \n    if l <= pos <= r:\n        left_closing = 0\n        right_closing = 0\n        \n        if pos < l or pos > r:\n            pass\n            \n        if l != 1:\n            left_closing = 1\n        if r != n:\n            right_closing = 1\n            \n        total_seconds = left_closing + right_closing\n        \n        if left_closing and right_closing:\n            if pos == l and pos == r:\n                total_seconds = 1\n            else:\n                total_seconds += 1\n                \n        print(total_seconds)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: If the desired segment [l, r] covers all tabs (i.e., `l == 1` and `r == n`), the answer is 0 because no tabs need to be closed.\n2. **Cursor Outside Segment**: If the starting position `pos` is outside the segment [l, r], the solution involves moving the cursor to the nearest end of the segment and then closing the opposite side. The number of moves is calculated as the distance from `pos` to the segment boundary plus one second to close the tabs.\n3. **Cursor Inside Segment**: If `pos` is within [l, r], the solution checks if there are tabs outside the segment. If so, it calculates the minimal steps to close both sides (left and right). The closing operations can be done in one second each, but if both sides need closing, an additional second might be required to position the cursor correctly if it's not already at one of the boundaries.\n4. **Edge Cases**: Special cases where the segment boundaries coincide with the start or end of the tab list are handled to ensure minimal operations.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all possible scenarios by breaking down the problem into manageable cases and calculating the minimal steps required for each case.",
