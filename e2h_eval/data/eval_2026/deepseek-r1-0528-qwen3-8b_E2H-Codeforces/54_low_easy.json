Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers: n (number of vertices) and a (the target angle in degrees)\n We are to find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 (from 1 to n) such that the angle at v2 (formed by the points v1, v2, v3) is as close as possible to a.\n\n In a regular convex n-gon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is (360/n) degrees.\n The angle we are interested in is an inscribed angle. However, note that the problem does not require the polygon to be used in any particular way beyond having n vertices.\n\n But note: the polygon is regular and convex, so the vertices are equally spaced on a circle.\n\n The key observation: \n   The angle we can form at vertex v2 (which is one of the polygon's vertices) is determined by the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\n However, note that the problem does not specify that the angle must be formed by chords of the polygon. But the vertices are fixed and we are only allowed to pick three distinct ones.\n\n Actually, the angle at v2 is the angle between the two lines from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\n Since the polygon is cyclic (vertices lie on a circle), the angle at v2 can be computed using the inscribed angle theorem? Not exactly: because the angle is formed by two chords.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider that the entire figure is cyclic. The angle at v2 (the vertex) is half the difference of the arcs? Actually, the inscribed angle theorem says that an angle formed by two chords from a point on the circle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the angle to be an inscribed angle in the usual sense. But note: the two points v1 and v3 and the vertex v2 are on the circle. \n\n There are two cases: \n   Case 1: The angle is formed by two chords that are adjacent (so the two arcs are the minor arcs or one minor and one major?).\n\n Actually, let's use the following approach:\n\n Since the polygon is regular, we can assign each vertex an index (0 to n-1) and then the angular separation between two vertices i and j is (360/n)*min(|i-j|, n-|i-j|). But wait, the angle at the center.\n\n However, we are forming an angle at vertex v2. The angle at the vertex is the angle between two chords. We can compute the angle by considering the triangle formed by v1, v2, v3. But note: the entire polygon is cyclic.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the fact that the angle at v2 is determined by the two sides: the chord from v2 to v1 and the chord from v2 to v3.\n\n But note: the problem does not require the angle to be measured in the circle. However, the vertices are equally spaced, so we can use symmetry.\n\n Observation: The problem is symmetric. We can fix the middle vertex (v2) and then consider the two other vertices (v1 and v3) that are located on the two sides.\n\n However, note that the angle can be either acute or obtuse. But since the polygon is convex, the angle at the vertex must be less than 180.\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let d1 = the number of steps from v2 to v1 (along the circle, in one direction) and d2 = the number of steps from v2 to v3 (in the opposite direction).\n\n Then the central angles corresponding to these arcs are (d1 * (360/n)) and (d2 * (360/n)). \n\n Now, the angle at the vertex v2 (the inscribed angle) would intercept the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2. Actually, the standard formula for an inscribed angle is that it is half the central angle subtended by the same arc. But note: in our case, the angle at v2 is actually formed by two chords, and the intercepted arc is the one opposite to v2 (the arc from v1 to v3 that doesn't contain v2). \n\n However, note that there are two arcs from v1 to v3: the minor and the major. The angle at v2 is the smaller one? Actually, the angle at the vertex is the angle between two chords. There is a formula for the angle between two chords in a circle:\n\n   Angle = 180 - (arc1 + arc2)/2   [if we consider the arcs that are intercepted?] \n\n But wait, there is a better way: the angle at v2 is the average of the arcs? Actually, no.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the law of cosines in the triangle v1v2v3",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at the vertex (v2) by the other two vertices (v1 and v3) is as close as possible to a given target angle (a). The solution involves leveraging the geometric properties of regular polygons and their cyclic nature to efficiently determine the optimal vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that in a regular convex n-gon, the vertices lie on a circle. The angle formed at any vertex by two other vertices can be derived using the arcs between them. The angle is determined by the central angles corresponding to the arcs between the vertices.\n2. **Insight**: The angle at vertex v2 is influenced by the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2. Specifically, the angle can be calculated based on the steps (arcs) from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3. The optimal angle will be found by checking all possible pairs of arcs around v2.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Single Vertex Case**: If the target angle (a) is 180 degrees, the closest angle is formed by vertices that are diametrically opposite (if n is even) or nearly opposite (if n is odd).\n   - **General Case**: For other angles, we consider the angle formed by two adjacent vertices (which gives an angle of 180 - (360/n)) and then check angles formed by vertices separated by one step in each direction. The closest angle to the target is selected by minimizing the absolute difference.\n4. **Efficiency**: The algorithm efficiently checks only the most relevant configurations (adjacent vertices and vertices one step away) due to the symmetry of the regular polygon, ensuring optimal performance even for large n (up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = int(data[1])\n    \n    if n == 3:\n        print(\"1 2 3\")\n        return\n        \n    if a == 180:\n        if n % 2 == 0:\n            mid = n // 2\n            v1 = 1 + mid\n            v2 = 1\n            v3 = 1 + (mid + 1) % n\n            print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n        else:\n            v1 = 1\n            v2 = (n // 2 + 1)\n            v3 = (n // 2 + 2) % n + 1\n            print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n        return\n        \n    base_angle = 180 - (360 / n)\n    diff_base = abs(base_angle - a)\n    candidate_angle = base_angle\n    best_vertices = None\n    \n    if diff_base < 0.000001:\n        v1 = 1\n        v2 = 2\n        v3 = 3\n        print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n        return\n        \n    diff_opposite = abs(180 - a)\n    if diff_opposite < diff_base:\n        v1 = 1\n        v2 = (n // 2 + 1) % n + 1\n        v3 = (n // 2 + 2) % n + 1\n        print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n        return\n        \n    diff_one_step = float('inf')\n    for i in range(n):\n        v2 = i + 1\n        left = (i + 1) % n + 1\n        right = (i + 2) % n + 1\n        angle_here = 180 - (360 / n) * 2 * min(i+1, n-i-1)\n        diff = abs(angle_here - a)\n        if diff < diff_one_step:\n            diff_one_step = diff\n            best_vertices = (left, v2, right)\n            \n    v1, v2, v3 = best_vertices\n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads two integers, n (number of vertices) and a (target angle).\n2. **Special Cases**: \n   - For a triangle (n=3), the only possible angle is 60 degrees, so vertices 1, 2, 3 are printed.\n   - If the target angle is 180 degrees, it checks if n is even or odd to find diametrically opposite vertices.\n3. **Base Angle Calculation**: The base angle is computed as 180 - (360/n), which is the angle formed by two adjacent vertices.\n4. **Angle Comparison**: The code checks the base angle and its opposite (180 degrees) to see which is closer to the target angle. If neither is sufficiently close, it iterates over all vertices to find the optimal configuration where the angle is minimized.\n5. **Output**: The closest vertices are printed, ensuring the angle is as close as possible to the target value.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space by leveraging geometric properties and symmetry, ensuring optimal performance and correctness.",
