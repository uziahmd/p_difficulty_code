    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a more straightforward method.\n We are to find the longest substring that appears at least twice (and they can overlap).\n\n Approach:\n Since the string length is small (<=100), we can consider checking all possible substrings and record their occurrences.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input string.\n 2. We'll consider all possible substrings (by starting index and length) and store the substring and its starting indices.\n    However, we don't need to store all; we just need to know if a substring appears at least twice.\n\n Alternate approach:\n   We can iterate over all substring lengths from n//2 down to 1 (but note: we want the longest, so start from the largest possible and go downward until we find one that repeats).\n   But note: the problem says \"at least twice\", and occurrences can overlap.\n\n However, note: the sample input includes:\n   Input: 'abcd' -> Output: 0 (no repeated substring)\n   Input: 'ababa' -> Output: 3 (because 'aba' appears twice, also 'bab' but same length? Actually, note: \n        In 'ababa': \n          substring of length 3: \n            \"aba\" (starting at 0) and \"aba\" (starting at 2) -> so two times.\n            \"bab\" (starting at 1) and then no other \"bab\" (because next would be from index 3: 'ba' only, and from index 4: nothing) -> actually, wait: \n          The substring \"aba\" is found at [0:3] and [2:5] (if we consider 0-indexed and substring of length 3). Also, we have \"bab\" at [1:4] but that's length 3 and does it appear again? \n          Actually, the substring \"aba\" is the only one of length 3 that appears twice. However, note that the problem says \"longest substring\". \n\n   Another example: 'zzz' -> output 2. Why?\n        Substrings of length 2: \n          \"zz\" (at index0 and index1) -> so two times. \n        What about length 3? \n          \"zzz\" appears only once (from index0 to index2). So the longest repeated substring has length 2.\n\n 3. We can do:\n\n    Let n = len(s)\n    We want to check for a substring of length L that appears at least twice. We can try L from n//2 down to 1, but wait: the repeated substring might be longer than n//2? Actually, no: because if a substring of length L appears twice, then the two occurrences must not necessarily be contiguous. However, the maximum length we can have for a repeated substring is floor(n/2) if we require two non-overlapping? But the problem allows overlapping.\n\n    Actually, note: the substring \"aaa\" in \"aaaa\": \n        s = \"aaaa\", n=4. \n        The substring \"aa\" (length=2) appears at indices 0,1,2 -> three times.\n        The substring \"aaa\" (length=3) appears at indices 0 and 1 -> two times. So the answer for \"aaaa\" should be 3.\n\n    Therefore, the maximum length of a repeated substring can be up to n-1 (if the entire string is repeated? but no, because we need two occurrences). Actually, the two occurrences must be distinct. \n\n    How long can the substring be? Consider: the two occurrences must have some part that doesn't overlap? Actually, they can overlap arbitrarily.\n\n    However, note: the substring must appear at least twice. The minimal condition for a substring of length L to appear twice is that there are two starting indices i and j (with i < j) such that the substring starting at i of length L equals the substring starting at j of length L.\n\n    The constraint on j is that j + L <= n. So the first occurrence starts at i and the second at j, with i < j and j <= n - L.\n\n    The maximum L for which we can have two occurrences is when the entire string is of length n, then we require j <= n-L. The smallest j can be is i+1, so we require i+1 <= n-L -> i <= n-L-1. And i must be at least 0.\n\n    But note: the two occurrences can be anywhere, even with gaps. However, the maximum L is n (the whole string) but then we need two whole strings, which requires the string to be duplicated. But if the string is \"aaa\", then the whole string \"aaa\" appears only once. So we cannot have L = n.\n\n    Actually, the maximum L is n-1: because if we",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, and the string consists of lowercase Latin letters with a maximum length of 100 characters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves checking all possible substrings of the input string to determine if any substring appears more than once. The key insight is that the longest such substring will be found by checking from the largest possible length down to 1.\n2. **Intuition**: For each possible substring length, starting from the largest (which is the length of the string minus one) down to 1, we check if there exists at least two distinct starting positions where the substring matches. If found, we immediately return the length of that substring as it is the longest possible.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm iterates over all possible substring lengths in descending order. For each length, it checks every possible starting position in the string to see if the substring of that length starting at one position matches any other substring of the same length elsewhere in the string.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Given the constraint that the string length does not exceed 100, the approach efficiently checks all possible substrings without excessive computational overhead. The worst-case time complexity is O(n^3), which is feasible for n ≤ 100.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        found = False\n        for start in range(n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[start:start+L]\n            for other_start in range(start + 1, n - L + 1):\n                if s[other_start:other_start+L] == substr:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n            if found:\n                break\n        if found:\n            print(L)\n            return\n            \n    print(0)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace. If the string is empty, the output is 0.\n2. **Substring Length Iteration**: The loop starts from the largest possible substring length (n-1) down to 1. This ensures the first found valid length is the longest.\n3. **Substring Matching**: For each substring length, the code checks all possible starting positions. For each starting position, it checks if the substring matches any other occurrence later in the string.\n4. **Early Termination**: If a matching substring is found, the current length is printed, and the program exits, returning the longest valid substring length.\n5. **No Match Case**: If no matching substrings are found after all lengths are checked, the output is 0, indicating no repeated substrings exist.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the longest repeating substring by leveraging nested loops and early termination upon finding a solution, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.",
