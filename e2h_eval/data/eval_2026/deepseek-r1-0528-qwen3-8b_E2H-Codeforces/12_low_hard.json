The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the tasks)\n The ringroad is circular with n houses, numbered 1 to n in clockwise order.\n We start at house 1, and we must complete the tasks in the given order (each task i requires being at house a_i, and we must complete all previous ones).\n\n However, note: the problem says \"she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i\", meaning the order is fixed.\n\n Since the movement is only clockwise, we can break down the journey from one task to the next.\n\n Let's denote:\n   current = the house where we are (initially 1)\n   next_house = the next task's house\n\n But note: because it's a ringroad, going from a higher-numbered house to a lower-numbered house might be done by going the long way (but that would not be minimal). Actually, since we can only move clockwise, the minimal way to go from x to y is:\n\n   If x <= y: then the distance is y - x.\n   If x > y: then we have to go from x to n, then wrap around from n to 1, and then to y. So the distance is (n - x) + y.\n\n However, note: the problem says the ringroad is one-way clockwise. So we cannot go counterclockwise.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the houses as arranged in a circle. We can also compute the clockwise distance from x to y as:\n   d = (y - x) % n\n   But if y < x, then (y-x) is negative, so we do:\n   d = (y - x + n) % n   ? But wait, this gives the distance along the circle, but note: we are allowed to only go clockwise, so if we are at x and want to go to y, we can also consider the direct path without wrapping multiple times.\n\n Actually, the above formula (y - x + n) % n gives the shortest distance in a circle, but the problem doesn't allow going backwards. However, note that the entire movement is clockwise and we can pass through house 1 multiple times.\n\n But wait: the problem states that the ringroad is one-way and clockwise. So the minimal time from house x to house y is:\n   If x <= y: then y - x\n   Else: n - x + y\n\n However, note that we can also consider the possibility of going multiple rounds? But the problem does not require that, and since we are only moving from one task to the next (and tasks are in order), we don't need to consider more than one round because the next task is just the next one.\n\n But note: we start at house 1, and the first task might be any house. Then after completing the first task, we go to the second, etc.\n\n However, the example: \n   Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n   Steps: 1->3: \n        1 to 3: 3-1 = 2 (if 1<=3) -> but wait, the example says 1->2->3->4->1->2->3, which is 6 steps.\n\n Why? Because the example does not jump directly from 1 to 3. Actually, the example does: \n   Start at 1, then goes to 2 (step1), then to 3 (step2). Then from 3 to 2: but 3>2, so the distance is n-3+2 = 4-3+2 = 3. Then from 2 to 3: 3-2=1. Total steps: 2 (from 1 to 3) + 3 (from 3 to 2) + 1 (from 2 to 3) = 6.\n\n But wait, the example sequence is: 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. So from 1 to 3: actually they went 1->2->3 (2 steps). Then from 3 to 2: 3->4 (1 step), 4->1 (1 step), 1->2 (1 step) -> total 3 steps for that segment. Then from 2 to 3: 1 step. So 2+3+1=6.\n\n How did they get the 3 steps from 3 to 2? Because 3->4->1->2.\n\n Therefore, the rule for the distance from x to y (with clockwise only) is:\n   If y >= x: distance = y - x\n   If y < x: distance = (n - x) + y\n\n However, note that we can also consider the entire circle: we can always go from x to y by:\n   distance = (",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad in a clockwise direction. The key observation here is that Xenia can only move clockwise, so the distance between two houses is calculated based on their positions in the circular arrangement.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in a specified order. Each task requires her to be at a specific house. The movement is restricted to clockwise direction, meaning she can only move to higher-numbered houses directly or wrap around from the end of the ring back to the start.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For each consecutive pair of tasks (from current house to next task's house), the distance is calculated as follows:\n   - If the next house number is greater than or equal to the current house number, the distance is simply the difference between them.\n   - If the next house number is less than the current house number, the distance is the sum of the remaining houses from the current position to the end of the ring plus the houses from the start to the next house.\n3. **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently processes each task in sequence, calculating the distance between consecutive tasks and accumulating the total time required. The algorithm operates in O(m) time, where m is the number of tasks, making it suitable for large inputs as specified in the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    total_time = 0\n    current = 1\n    \n    for i in range(m):\n        next_house = tasks[i]\n        if next_house >= current:\n            distance = next_house - current\n        else:\n            distance = (n - current) + next_house\n        total_time += distance\n        current = next_house\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of houses (n), the number of tasks (m), and the list of houses where tasks need to be performed.\n2. **Initialization**: The total time is initialized to 0, and the starting position (current house) is set to 1.\n3. **Processing Tasks**: For each task, the distance from the current house to the task's house is calculated. If the task's house is ahead (or equal) in the clockwise direction, the distance is straightforward. Otherwise, the distance accounts for wrapping around the end of the ring.\n4. **Accumulating Time**: The calculated distance for each segment is added to the total time, and the current position is updated to the task's house.\n5. **Output**: After processing all tasks, the total time is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal time by leveraging the circular nature of the ringroad and processing each task in sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
