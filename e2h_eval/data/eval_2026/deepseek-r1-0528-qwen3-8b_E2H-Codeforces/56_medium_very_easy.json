Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers R and B (number of rebels and bases) and then 2D coordinates for R rebels and then B bases.\n We need to assign each base to exactly one rebel and each rebel to exactly one base (perfect matching) such that the straight lines drawn from each base to its assigned rebel do not intersect.\n\n Observation: Since no three points are colinear and no two coincide, we can use a geometric property. The problem is equivalent to having a non-intersecting matching in the plane.\n\n However, note that the problem says \"any two (straight) paths do not intersect\". In graph terms, we have two sets of points (rebels and bases) and we want a perfect matching (if R=B) such that the edges (from base to rebel) do not cross.\n\n But note: the input may have R != B? Actually, the problem says: \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\" and \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", so we require R = B. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\n However, the input constraints say 1<=R,B<=10, but does the problem require R=B? The example inputs have R=B.\n\n Let me read the problem again: \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\" -> so we must have R=B.\n\n Therefore, if R != B, we output \"No\".\n\n But wait, the example input format: first line has two integers R and B. Then R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases.\n\n So, if R != B, then we cannot form a perfect matching (since |bases| must equal |rebels|). So we can check:\n\n   if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        exit(0)\n\n However, note the example input: \n      Input: ['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n The second example has R=2, B=1 -> then we output No.\n\n But wait, the example output for the second example is 'No'. However, in the example input representation, the second example is given as:\n\n        '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1'\n\n This means R=2, B=1. So we cannot assign two rebels to one base (each base must have one and each rebel must have one) so indeed R must equal B.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read R and B.\n 2. If R != B, output \"No\".\n 3. Else, read the next R lines for rebels and B lines for bases.\n\n Now, how to check for a non-intersecting perfect matching?\n\n We have two sets: \n   S: set of rebels (with coordinates)\n   T: set of bases (with coordinates)\n\n We want to know if there exists a bijection f: S -> T such that the line segments connecting each base t with the rebel s (i.e., segment (t, s)) do not intersect.\n\n Note: The entire matching is a set of segments. The condition is that no two segments (from different pairs) intersect.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" meaning that we don't want any two segments to cross.\n\n But note: the rebels and bases are distinct and no three points are colinear.\n\n There is a known fact: In a set of points in the plane, a non-crossing matching can be found if the points are in convex position? Actually, we have two sets (like bipartite matching) but here the two sets are mixed arbitrarily.\n\n However, note: the problem does not specify which set is which. But we have two sets: rebels and bases.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We can try to find a non-crossing matching by ordering the points. Since the numbers are small (at most 10), we can try to use a recursive backtracking (which would be 10! worst-case) but 10! is about 3.6e6 which is acceptable for n=10.\n\n But wait, we have two sets, so we can consider ordering the entire set of points (both rebels and bases) by x-coordinate (or y-coordinate) and then check for crossings.\n\n However, note: the segments are between rebels and bases. We are allowed to connect any rebel to any base.\n\n How to check if two segments (a-b) and (c-d) intersect? We can use standard segment intersection algorithm.\n\n But note: the entire set of points (rebels and bases) might not be in convex position, and we are only drawing segments between the two sets.\n\n There is a known method for non-crossing bipartite matching? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the following idea:\n\n Consider the entire set of points (both rebels and bases) and sort them by x (and if tie by y). Then, we can use a recursive function that tries to assign the leftmost point (lowest x, or if same x then lowest y) to one of the available points in the other set, and then check for crossing.\n\n However, note: the problem doesn't require the matching to be planar in the entire set, but only that the segments connecting base to rebel do not cross.\n\n Another idea: we can fix an ordering and then use the following property:\n\n   A matching of two sets (with no two segments crossing) exists if and only if the two sets are interleaved appropriately.\n\n But note: the problem is small (n<=10). We can generate all permutations (which is factorial) and check for each matching whether the segments do not cross.\n\n Steps:\n\n   - Check if R == B, else output \"No\"\n   - If R==B, then we have n = R = B, and we have 2*n points.\n\n   We can label the rebels and bases. But we don't know which is which. Actually, we are given two sets: one set of rebels (first R points) and bases (next B points). And we are to match rebels to bases.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not require that the rebels and bases are matched in the order they appear. They are just two sets.\n\n   So, we have two lists: \n        rebels = list of R points\n        bases = list of B points\n\n   Then, we wish to assign each rebel to a base (a bijection) such that the segments (rebel_i, base_j) do not cross.\n\n   How to check for crossing?\n\n        Two segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) cross if the points of the two segments are interleaved. More precisely, the standard way is to check if the two segments intersect.\n\n   However, note: the matching is a set of n segments. We must check that no two segments (from the matching) intersect.\n\n   But note: the entire set of segments must be non-crossing. This is a planarity condition.\n\n   However, note: the segments are between two sets. This is similar to a bipartite matching in the complete bipartite graph, and we are looking for a non-crossing matching.\n\n   We can use the following:\n\n        Sort all points by x (and then by y) and then use a greedy matching? \n\n   Actually, there is a known fact: if we sort the rebels and bases by x (or y) and then match in that order, we might get a non-crossing matching? Not necessarily.\n\n   Example: \n        Rebels: [(0,0), (2,0)]\n        Bases: [(1,1), (3,0)]\n\n        If we sort by x: \n            Rebels: [(0,0), (2,0)]\n            Bases: [(1,1), (3,0)]\n\n        Matching: (0,0) to (1,1) and (2,0) to (3,0) -> these two segments do not cross.\n\n        But if we match (0,0) to (3,0) and (2,0) to (1,1), then the segments: from (0,0) to (3,0) and (2,0) to (1,1) cross? \n\n        Let's draw: \n            Segment1: (0,0) to (3,0) is on the x-axis from 0 to 3.\n            Segment2: (2,0) to (1,1): goes from (2,0) to (1,1). This segment crosses the x-axis at (2,0) and goes up, and then from (2,0) to (1,1) is above the x-axis. Does it cross the first segment? The first segment is on the x-axis from 0 to 3. The second segment starts at (2,0) and ends at (1,1). The point (2,0) is on the first segment. \n\n        But note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect\". The paths are from base to rebel. So the base (3,0) is connected to rebel (0,0) and base (1,1) is connected to rebel (2,0). \n\n        The segment from base (1,1) to rebel (2,0) and the segment from base (3,0) to rebel (0,0) do not share endpoints, and they cross at some point? \n\n        Actually, the two segments: (0,0)-(3,0) and (2,0)-(1,1) share the point (2,0) for the second segment and (3,0) for the first segment? Wait, no: the first segment is from (0,0) to (3,0). The second segment is from (2,0) to (1,1). The point (2,0) is on the first segment. So they share an endpoint? No, because the rebels and bases are distinct and no three points are colinear. But note: the base (3,0) and rebel (0,0) form a segment, and the base (1,1) and rebel (2,0) form a segment. The two segments share the point (2,0)? Actually, no: the rebels are (0,0) and (2,0); the bases are (1,1) and (3,0). The segment from base (3,0) to rebel (0,0) is (3,0) to (0,0). The segment from base (1,1) to rebel (2,0) is (1,1) to (2,0). These two segments do not share any point (because (2,0) is a rebel and (3,0) is a base, and (0,0) is a rebel and (1,1) is a base). \n\n        However, the two segments (0,0)-(3,0) and (1,1)-(2,0) do not share endpoints. Do they cross?\n\n        Let's check: \n          Segment 1: from (0,0) to (3,0)\n          Segment 2: from (1,1) to (2,0)\n\n        The second segment goes from (1,1) to (2,0). The first segment is the x-axis from 0 to 3. The second segment starts above the x-axis and ends at (2,0) which is on the x-axis. The entire segment from (1,1) to (2,0) is above the x-axis until the last point. So they don't cross in the interior. \n\n        But wait, what if we have:\n\n          Rebels: [(0,0), (2,0)]\n          Bases: [(-1,1), (3,0)]\n\n        Then matching: (0,0) to (-1,1) and (2,0) to (3,0) -> no crossing.\n\n        Matching: (0,0) to (3,0) and (2,0) to (-1,1) -> \n          Segment1: (0,0)-(3,0)\n          Segment2: (2,0)-(-1,1) -> this goes from (2,0) to (-1,1). This segment crosses the x-axis? Actually, from (2,0) to (-1,1): it starts at (2,0) and goes to (-1,1). The entire segment lies above the x-axis (except the starting point). So they don't cross.\n\n        But what if we have:\n\n          Rebels: [(0,0), (2,0)]\n          Bases: [(1,1), (1,-1)]\n\n        Matching: (0,0) to (1,1) and (2,0) to (1,-1): \n          Segment1: (0,0)-(1,1)\n          Segment2: (2,0)-(1,-1)\n\n        These two segments: one from (0,0) to (1,1) and the other from (2,0) to (1,-1). They both go through (1,?) but wait, (1,1) and (1,-1) are different. The two segments do not share an endpoint.\n\n        Now, do they cross? \n          The first segment: from (0,0) to (1,1) is the line y=x.\n          The second segment: from (2,0) to (1,-1) is the line from (2,0) to (1,-1): slope = (-1-0)/(1-2) = (-1)/(-1)=1, so y = x - 2? Actually, at (2,0): 0 = 2 - 2 -> holds. At (1,-1): -1 = 1-2 -> holds.\n\n        Now, do the two lines cross? The two lines are:\n          y = x\n          y = x - 2\n\n        They are parallel and distinct, so they never cross.\n\n        But wait, let me check the segments: \n          The first segment is from (0,0) to (1,1) (so x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to 1).\n          The second segment is from (2,0) to (1,-1) (x from 1 to 2, y from -1 to 0).\n\n        The first segment is entirely in the square [0,1]x[0,1] and the second in [1,2]x[-1,0]. They meet at (1,?)? \n          For the first segment at x=1, y=1.\n          For the second segment at x=1, y=-1.\n\n        So they don't meet. And they are in different regions. So no crossing.\n\n        However, consider:\n\n          Rebels: [(0,0), (0,2)]\n          Bases: [(1,1), (-1,1)]\n\n        Matching: (0,0) to (1,1) and (0,2) to (-1,1): \n          Segment1: (0,0)-(1,1): line y=x\n          Segment2: (0,2)-(-1,1): line from (0,2) to (-1,1): slope = (1-2)/(-1-0) = (-1)/(-1)=1, so y = x + 2.\n\n        These two lines are parallel and distinct. The segments: \n          Segment1: from (0,0) to (1,1) -> x in [0,1], y in [0,1]\n          Segment2: from (0,2) to (-1,1) -> x in [-1,0], y in [1,2]\n\n        Again, they don't meet.\n\n        Now, what if we have:\n\n          Rebels: [(0,0), (0,2)]\n          Bases: [(1,1), (-1,1)]\n\n        But we can also try the other matching: (0,0) to (-1,1) and (0,2) to (1,1)\n\n          Segment1: (0,0)-(-1,1): line from (0,0) to (-1,1): slope = (1-0)/(-1-0) = -1 -> y = -x.\n          Segment2: (0,2)-(1,1): line from (0,2) to (1,1): slope = (1-2)/(1-0) = -1 -> y = -x + 2.\n\n        Again, two parallel lines. The segments: \n          Segment1: from (0,0) to (-1,1): x from -1 to 0, y from 0 to 1 (but wait, at x=-1, y=-(-1)=1; at x=0, y=0) -> so the segment goes from (0,0) to (-1,1). The equation is y = -x, so for x=-1, y=1; for x=0, y=0.\n          Segment2: from (0,2) to (1,1): y = -x+2, so at x=0, y=2; at x=1, y=1.\n\n        Now, do they cross? They are two distinct lines with the same slope. They don't intersect.\n\n        But wait, what if we have:\n\n          Rebels: [(0,0), (2,0)]\n          Bases: [(1,1), (1,-1)]\n\n        And we match (0,0) to (1,-1) and (2,0) to (1,1): \n          Segment1: (0,0)-(1,-1): y = x (but wait: from (0,0) to (1,-1): slope = (-1-0)/(1-0) = -1 -> y = -x.\n          Segment2: (2,0)-(1,1): slope = (1-0)/(1-2)=1/(-1)=-1 -> y = -x + 2.\n\n        Again, parallel.\n\n        It seems that in these examples, the matching doesn't cause crossing because the lines are either parallel or don't intersect in the segments.\n\n        However, the problem is more general. How about:\n\n          Rebels: [(0,0), (0,3)]\n          Bases: [(1,1), (1,2)]\n\n        Matching: (0,0) to (1,1) and (0,3) to (1,2): \n          Segment1: (0,0)-(1,1): y=x\n          Segment2: (0,3)-(1,2): slope = (2-3)/(1-0) = -1 -> y = -x+3.\n\n        Do these two segments cross? \n          Solve: x = -x+3 -> 2x=3 -> x=1.5, y=1.5. \n          Now, is (1.5,1.5) on both segments?\n          Segment1: from (0,0) to (1,1): x from 0 to 1 -> 1.5 is beyond 1 -> not on the segment.\n          Segment2: from (0,3) to (1,2): x from 0 to 1 -> 1.5 is beyond 1 -> not on the segment.\n\n        So they don't cross.\n\n        Now, what if:\n\n          Rebels: [(0,0), (0,4)]\n          Bases: [(1,1), (1,3)]\n\n        Matching: (0,0) to (1,1) and (0,4) to (1,3): \n          Segment1: (0,0)-(1,1): y=x\n          Segment2: (0,4)-(1,3): y = -x+4.\n\n        Intersection: x = -x+4 -> 2x=4 -> x=2, y=2. \n        But x=2 is beyond the x-range of both segments (0 to 1). So no crossing.\n\n        But now, if we swap:\n\n          Rebels: [(0,0), (0,4)]\n          Bases: [(1,1), (1,3)]\n\n        Matching: (0,0) to (1,3) and (0,4) to (1,1): \n          Segment1: (0,0)-(1,3): y=3x\n          Segment2: (0,4)-(1,1): y = -3x+4.\n\n        Intersection: 3x = -3x+4 -> 6x=4 -> x=2/3, y=2.\n\n        Now, check if (2/3,2) is on both segments?\n          Segment1: from (0,0) to (1,3): x from 0 to 1, 2/3 is between 0 and 1 -> yes.\n          Segment2: from (0,4) to (1,1): x from 0 to 1, 2/3 is between 0 and 1 -> yes.\n\n        So they cross.\n\n        Therefore, we must avoid that matching.\n\n        How to check for two segments (A-B and C-D) if they intersect (properly, i.e., not at endpoints)? \n\n        We can use the standard orientation test (cross product) to check if the points are in counter-clockwise order.\n\n        Steps for checking two segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) for proper intersection:\n\n          Define a function ccw(A, B, C): returns True if points A, B, C are in counter-clockwise order.\n\n          Then, the segments (p1,q1) and (p2,q2) intersect if and only if:\n            ccw(p1, q1, p2) != ccw(p1, q1, q2) and \n            ccw(p1, p2, q1) != ccw(p1, p2, q2)   [this is the standard method?]\n\n        Actually, the standard method is:\n\n          Two segments (p1,q1) and (p2,q2) intersect (including endpoints) if:\n            ccw(p1, q1, p2) * ccw(p1, q1, q2) <= 0 and\n            ccw(p1, p2, q2) * ccw(q1, p2, q2) <= 0\n\n        But note: we don't want endpoints to count as intersections? The problem says \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect\", and note that the endpoints are distinct (no two points coincide). However, the endpoints are from different sets (rebels and bases) so they are distinct. But two segments could share an endpoint? \n\n        Actually, the endpoints are distinct: the rebels and bases are distinct. So the four endpoints are distinct. But wait: the segment from base A to rebel X and the segment from base B to rebel Y: the endpoints are {A, X} and {B, Y}. Since all points are distinct, the endpoints are distinct. Therefore, we are only concerned with proper intersections (not at endpoints).\n\n        However, note: the entire set of points (rebels and bases) are distinct, so no two points are the same. Therefore, the endpoints of the segments are distinct.\n\n        So we can check for proper intersection (interior intersections) by:\n\n          def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n              # returns True if segments (a,b) and (c,d) intersect properly (not including endpoints)\n              # We'll use the orientation method.\n\n              def orientation(o, a, b):\n                  # returns the cross product of vectors (a-o) and (b-o)\n                  return (a[0]-o[0])*(b[1]-o[1]) - (a[1]-o[1])*(b[0]-o[0])\n\n              o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n              o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n              o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n              o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n\n              # General case: if the two segments intersect, then one segment has one point on each side of the other segment.\n              # But we have to check the signs.\n\n              # However, note: we don't want endpoints. So if one of the endpoints is colinear, then we consider it as not proper.\n\n              # Actually, the problem states no three points are colinear, so we don't have to worry about colinear cases.\n\n              # Then, the condition is:\n              #   (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n\n              return (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n\n        But wait, if the segments are not colinear and no three points are colinear, then this should work.\n\n        However, note: the entire set of 2*n points are distinct and no three are colinear.\n\n        Now, we have to check for a given matching (a list of n segments) that no two segments intersect.\n\n        Since n<=10, we can iterate over every pair of segments and check if they intersect.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          - Read R, B. If R != B: output \"No\".\n          - Read the rebels (R points) and bases (B points).\n\n          - Generate all bijections (permutations of bases for rebels). There are n! possibilities, where n=R=B (at most 10, so 10! ~ 3.6e6 which is acceptable in Python if we code carefully).\n\n          - For each bijection (matching: assign the i-th rebel to the j-th base, where j is the index in the permutation), we check that for every pair of segments (the two sets of segments: one from rebel i to base j, and another from rebel k to base l) they do not intersect.\n\n          - If we find one matching that has no intersecting segments, output \"Yes\" and break.\n\n          - If none works, output \"No\".\n\n        However, note: the total number of permutations is factorial(n) and n can be up to 10 (which is 10! = 3628800). This is acceptable in many languages including Python for n=10, but we must write efficient code.\n\n        We can use itertools.permutations for the bases.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          import itertools\n\n          rebels = list of R points (each point is (x,y))\n          bases = list of B points (each point is (x,y))\n\n          n = R = B\n\n          for perm in itertools.permutations(bases):\n              # This perm is a tuple of bases: we assign the i-th rebel to the i-th base in the permutation.\n              valid = True\n              # We'll create a list of segments: [ (rebels[i], perm[i]) for i in range(n) ]\n\n              # Then, check every pair of segments for proper intersection.\n\n              segments = []\n              for i in range(n):\n                  segments.append( (rebels[i], perm[i]) )\n\n              # Now, check for any two segments in segments that intersect (properly)\n              for i in range(len(segments)):\n                  for j in range(i+1, len(segments)):\n                      if segments_intersect(segments[i][0], segments[i][1], segments[j][0], segments[j][1]):\n                          valid = False\n                          break\n                  if not valid:\n                      break\n\n              if valid:\n                  print(\"Yes\")\n                  exit(0)\n\n          print(\"No\")\n\n        We need to define the helper function `segments_intersect` and the inner `orientation` function.\n\n        But note: the segments_intersect function we defined above uses orientation. However, we must consider that the segments are defined by two distinct points.\n\n        However, there is a caveat: the standard orientation test for segment intersection requires the segments to be in general position (no three colinear) which we have.\n\n        Let me test the segments_intersect function with the example that should cross:\n\n          Rebels: [(0,0), (0,4)]\n          Bases: [(1,1), (1,3)]\n\n          Matching: (0,0) to (1,3) and (0,4) to (1,1)\n\n          Segment1: (0,0) to (1,3)\n          Segment2: (0,4) to (1,1)\n\n          We expect them to cross.\n\n          orientation(a, b, c) for a=(0,0), b=(1,3), c=(0,4):\n            (1-0)*(4-0) - (3-0)*(0-0) = 1*4 - 3*0 = 4 > 0\n\n          orientation(a, b, d) for d=(1,1):\n            (1-0)*(1-0) - (3-0)*(1-0) = 1*1 - 3*1 = 1 - 3 = -2 < 0\n\n          So o1 * o2 = 4 * (-2) = negative -> so the first segment has the two points (0,4) and (1,1) on opposite sides.\n\n          Now, for the second segment (c,d) = (0,4) to (1,1) and we check against (0,0) and (1,3):\n\n          orientation(c, d, a) = orientation((0,4),(1,1),(0,0)):\n            (1-0)*(0-4) - (1-4)*(0-0) = 1*(-4) - (-3)*0 = -4 < 0\n\n          orientation(c, d, b) = orientation((0,4),(1,1),(1,3)):\n            (1-0)*(3-4) - (1-4)*(1-0) = 1*(-1) - (-3)*1 = -1 + 3 = 2 > 0\n\n          So o3 * o4 = (-4)*2 = negative.\n\n          Then, according to the condition: (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0) -> (negative and negative) is true.\n\n          However, wait: the condition we wrote was (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0). But note: the standard condition is that the two orientations for the first segment (for the two points of the second segment) have opposite signs, and similarly for the second segment.\n\n          Actually, the standard condition is:\n\n            (orientation(a, b, c) * orientation(a, b, d) < 0) and (orientation(c, d, a) * orientation(c, d, b) < 0)\n\n          But note: the example above: \n            (4 * (-2)) = -8 < 0 -> true\n            (-4 * 2) = -8 < 0 -> true\n\n          So the function returns True (they intersect) which is correct.\n\n        However, note: the standard condition sometimes uses the absolute value and also considers the possibility of colinear points, but we don't have that.\n\n        But wait, there is another way: the standard condition is:\n\n            (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n\n        But note: the definition of orientation for a point being on the segment? Actually, the above condition checks for proper intersection (not at endpoints) because if a point lies on the other segment, then the orientation might be zero, but we are guaranteed no three colinear so no zero.\n\n        Therefore, we can use:\n\n            def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                def orientation(o, a, b):\n                    return (a[0]-o[0])*(b[1]-o[1]) - (a[1]-o[1])*(b[0]-o[0])\n\n                o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n                o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n                o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n                o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n\n                if o1 * o2 < 0 and o3 * o4 < 0:\n                    return True\n                else:\n                    return False\n\n        However, wait: there is a known issue: the condition must be that the two segments straddle each other. The above condition is the standard one.\n\n        But note: the standard condition is sometimes written with the absolute value and without the zeros? \n\n        Actually, the standard condition for two segments (AB and CD) to intersect (including endpoints) is:\n\n            (o1 * o2 <= 0) and (o3 * o4 <= 0) and (the bounding box condition) but actually the orientation method without bounding box is sufficient if we assume the segments are in general position? \n\n        However, the problem says no three points are colinear, so zeros won't occur.\n\n        But wait, the endpoints are distinct and no three points are colinear, so we are safe.\n\n        However, note: the segments_intersect function above uses the same four points: a, b, c, d. The four points are distinct and no three colinear.\n\n        But there is a catch: the four points might form a quadrilateral that is not strictly convex? Actually, the condition is purely combinatorial.\n\n        Let me test with the example that does not cross:\n\n          Rebels: [(0,0), (2,0)]\n          Bases: [(1,1), (3,0)]\n\n          Matching: (0,0) to (3,0) and (2,0) to (1,1)\n\n          Segment1: (0,0)-(3,0)\n          Segment2: (2,0)-(1,1)\n\n          Check: \n            o1 = orientation((0,0),(3,0),(2,0)) = (3-0)*(0-0) - (0-0)*(2-0) = 3*0 - 0*2 = 0 -> wait, but we have no three colinear? The points (0,0), (3,0), (2,0) are colinear! \n\n          But wait: the problem states \"no three points are on the same line\". So we are guaranteed that (0,0), (3,0), (2,0) are not all three on the same line? Actually, they are. \n\n          This contradicts the problem statement. The problem says: \"It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\"\n\n          So we can assume that no three points are colinear. Therefore, we will never have a zero orientation.\n\n          But wait, in the example above, we are using two points from the rebels and one from the bases. The rebels and bases together are 2*n points, and the condition says no three points are on the same line. So (0,0), (3,0), (2,0) are three points from the entire set? \n\n          Actually, the entire set of points (rebels and bases) has 2*n points (n=2, so 4 points). The condition says no three points are on the same line. So (0,0), (3,0), (2,0) are three points and they are colinear, which violates the condition.\n\n          Therefore, the example input must satisfy that no three points (from the entire set) are colinear.\n\n          So our function is safe.\n\n        However, wait: the example input we used was:\n\n          Rebels: [(0,0), (2,0)]\n          Bases: [(1,1), (3,0)]\n\n          This set of points: [(0,0), (2,0), (1,1), (3,0)] -> are (0,0), (2,0), (3,0) colinear? Yes, they lie on the x-axis. So this example is not allowed by the input guarantee.\n\n        Therefore, we don't have to worry about zeros.\n\n        Code:\n\n          import itertools\n\n          def main():\n              data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n              if not data:\n                  print(\"No\")\n                  return\n\n              # Parse the first two integers\n              r = int(data[0])\n              b = int(data[1])\n              # If r != b, then output No and return.\n              if r != b:\n                  print(\"No\")\n                  return\n\n              # Next r*2 numbers for rebels\n              rebels = []\n              index = 2\n              for i in range(r):\n                  x = int(data[index]); y = int(data[index+1]); index += 2\n                  rebels.append((x,y))\n\n              # Next b*2 numbers for bases\n              bases = []\n              for i in range(b):\n                  x = int(data[index]); y = int(data[index+1]); index += 2\n                  bases.append((x,y))\n\n              # If there are no points, then n=0 -> trivially Yes?

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between a set of Rebel spaceships and bases such that the straight-line paths connecting each base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect. The solution involves checking all possible bijections between the two sets (since each base must be matched to exactly one spaceship and vice versa) and verifying that none of the resulting line segments intersect.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires checking for a perfect matching between two sets of points (rebels and bases) such that the line segments connecting each pair do not intersect. The key observation is that the matching must be non-crossing, meaning no two segments should intersect except possibly at their endpoints, but since all points are distinct and no three are colinear, intersections can only occur in the interior of segments.\n\n2. **Intuition**: Given the constraints (R and B are at most 10), a brute-force approach is feasible. We generate all possible permutations of the bases (each permutation represents a potential matching) and check each permutation to see if the corresponding segments intersect.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Permutations**: Generate all possible ways to match each rebel to a base.\n   - **Segment Intersection Check**: For each generated matching, check all pairs of segments to ensure they do not intersect using the orientation test (cross product method).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The number of permutations is n! where n is the number of rebels (or bases). For n=10, this is 3,628,800 permutations. For each permutation, we check up to n*(n-1)/2 segment pairs. Each intersection check involves a constant-time orientation test. Thus, the overall complexity is O(n! * n^2), which is manageable for n ≤ 10.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    r = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    if r != b:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    rebels = []\n    bases = []\n    index = 2\n    for i in range(r):\n        x = int(data[index]); y = int(data[index+1]); index += 2\n        rebels.append((x, y))\n        \n    for i in range(b):\n        x = int(data[index]); y = int(data[index+1]); index += 2\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        \n    n = r\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"Yes\")\n        return\n        \n    def orientation(o, a, b):\n        return (a[0] - o[0]) * (b[1] - o[1]) - (a[1] - o[1]) * (b[0] - o[0])\n        \n    def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n        o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n        o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n        o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n        o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n        \n        return (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n        \n    for perm in itertools.permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        segments = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            segments.append( (rebels[i], perm[i]) )\n            \n        for i in range(len(segments)):\n            for j in range(i+1, len(segments)):\n                if segments_intersect(segments[i][0], segments[i][1], segments[j][0], segments[j][1]):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n                \n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n            \n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of rebels (R) and bases (B). If R and B are not equal, it immediately outputs \"No\" since a perfect matching is impossible.\n2. **Parsing Coordinates**: The coordinates of rebels and bases are stored in separate lists.\n3. **Edge Case Handling**: If there are no rebels or bases, it outputs \"Yes\" (though constraints ensure at least one point).\n4. **Orientation and Intersection Checks**: The `orientation` function calculates the cross product to determine the relative orientation of three points. The `segments_intersect` function checks if two segments intersect by verifying that their endpoints are on opposite sides of each other.\n5. **Permutations Check**: For each permutation of bases (potential matching), the code checks all pairs of segments to ensure no intersections. If a valid matching is found, it prints \"Yes\" and exits; otherwise, after checking all permutations, it prints \"No\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible matchings while leveraging geometric properties to ensure correctness.",
