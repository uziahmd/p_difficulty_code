Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов. В самом начале копирования оба прогресс-бара показывают $$$0$$$ процентов.Найдите все такие целые числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно, что существует момент времени, в который оба прогресс-бара одновременно показывают это число. Выведите эти числа в порядке возрастания.\n\n## Input\nВ первой строке задано одно целое число $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — число копируемых файлов.Во второй строке заданы $$$n$$$ целых чисел $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$$$) — размеры файлов в байтах в том порядке, в котором они будут копироваться.\n\n## Output\nВыведите в возрастающем порядке все числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно такие, что существует момент времени, в который на обоих прогресс-барах одновременно показывается это число.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\n### Output\n['0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100', '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100', '0\\n50\\n99\\n100', '0\\n17\\n43\\n44\\n84\\n90\\n99\\n100']\n\n## Note\nВ первом тесте копируется всего один файл, поэтому оба прогресс-бара всегда показывают одинаковые значения.Во втором тесте первый прогресс-бар сразу же уйдёт вперёд, потом сбросится в ноль и начнёт догонять второй прогресс-бар заново. В конце копирования прогресс-бары некоторое время будут показывать одно и то же число.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given n and a list of n integers (file sizes)\n Since the total size is at most 100 * 1000 = 100000 bytes, and n <= 100, we can simulate by iterating over each file and each byte?\n However, note: we cannot iterate over each byte (because a_i can be up to 1000, and 100 files would be 100000 bytes, which is acceptable in worst-case? But 100000 is acceptable for a loop in Python if we do it once, but note: we have to check for every progress value from 0 to 100.\n\nBut note: the problem asks for all numbers p in [0,100] such that there exists a moment when both progress bars show p.\n\nHowever, we cannot iterate over each byte (which might be 100000 steps) and then for each p from 0 to 100 (101 values) and check? That would be 100000 * 101 which is 10.1e6, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python we need to be cautious.\n\nBut note: the problem says the files are copied sequentially, and we update after each byte. So we have to consider the entire process.\n\nAlternatively, we can think:\n\nLet T = total sum = a1+a2+...+an.\n\nFor the second progress bar (overall) at a moment when we have copied x bytes (x being from 0 to T), the overall percentage is floor(100*x/T).\n\nFor the first progress bar (current file i, which is the j-th file being copied, and we are at the k-th byte of that file), the percentage is floor(100*k / a_j).\n\nBut note: the current file is the one we are currently copying. The moment must be during the copying of one particular file.\n\nWe can break the process into segments: for each file i (from 0 to n-1), and for k from 1 to a_i (the current file's size), the state is:\n  - overall copied: S_i = (a0 + a1 + ... + a_{i-1}) + k   [but wait, we are in the i-th file, so the previous files are done and we have copied k bytes of the i-th file]\n  - overall percentage: floor(100 * S_i / T)\n  - current file percentage: floor(100 * k / a_i)\n\nWe require that these two percentages are equal to some p.\n\nBut note: we also have the possibility that the moment is at the very beginning (0) and at the very end (100). However, the problem states that the progress bars update after each byte, so we can simulate.\n\nHowever, note: the example input '2\\n100 500' gives output 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nHow to avoid iterating over every byte? Because the total number of bytes is T (<=100000) and we have 100 files, so worst-case 100000 bytes * 100 files? Actually, no: we have one file at a time. We can iterate for each file, then for k from 1 to a_i (the current file size). Then we compute:\n   current_file_percent = (100 * k) // a_i   [this is an integer, but note: we use floor division, but 100*k//a_i is the same as floor(100*k/a_i) because k and a_i are integers? Yes, because (100*k)//a_i is floor(100*k / a_i) if we use integer division. But note: 100*k might not be divisible by a_i, so integer division is floor.]\n\n   total_so_far = (sum of previous files) + k\n   total_percent = (100 * total_so_far) // T\n\nThen we check if current_file_percent == total_percent and that value is between 0 and 100.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"exists a moment\", so we have to record for each p (from 0 to 100) whether it appears at least once.\n\nHowever, we must consider that the same p might appear multiple times, but we only need to know if it appears at least once.\n\nBut note: we must consider the entire process, including the boundaries (at the start, and during each file, and at the end).\n\nBut note: the start (0 bytes) is included: at the very beginning, both are 0. Also, at the end (T bytes) both are 100.\n\nBut wait: the example input ['4\\n1000 2 2 998'] gives output 0,50,99,100.\n\nLet me try with the provided examples.\n\nHowever, the worst-case total bytes is 100*1000 = 100000, and we have 100 files, so we are going to do at most 100000 * 100 iterations? Actually, no: because we break per file. The total number of bytes is T, but we are iterating over each byte of each file. The sum of the sizes of the files is T, so the total number of iterations is T (which is <=100000). So we can do:\n\nSteps:\n1. Read n.\n2. Read the list of a_i.\n3. Compute T = sum(a_i)\n4. Initialize a set (or a boolean list for 0..100) to mark which percentages occur.\n5. We start by adding 0 (since at the beginning, both are 0).\n6. Then, for each file i (with size a = a_i):\n      Let prefix_sum = sum of all files before i (if any)\n      Then for k in range(1, a+1):   [k from 1 to a]\n          current_percent = (100 * k) // a\n          total_so_far = prefix_sum + k\n          total_percent = (100 * total_so_far) // T\n\n          If current_percent == total_percent:\n              Then we mark that this value (current_percent) is present.\n\n      Also, note: what about the end of the file? We already include k from 1 to a, so the last byte (k=a) is included.\n\n7. Additionally, we must consider the moment right after finishing a file? Actually, the update happens after each byte, so the end of a file is included (k=a). And then the next file starts.\n\n8. But note: the overall progress bar doesn't jump, it's continuous. However, we are breaking by file. But we are considering each k from 1 to a_i for file i.\n\n9. Then, we must also consider the overall progression: the overall progress bar might show a value without the current file having that value? But note: the condition is that at the same moment (same byte copied) both must show the same p.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"after copying each byte\", so we are only concerned with the moments when we have just copied a byte. Therefore, we don't consider non-integer byte counts (like halfway through a byte) because we update only at whole bytes.\n\nHowever, note: the example output for the third test case: \n   Input: 4\\n1000 2 2 998\n   Output: 0,50,99,100\n\nSo let's verify:\n\nTotal T = 1000+2+2+998 = 2002.\n\nAt the beginning: 0.\n\nAfter first file (1000 bytes):\n   For k from 1 to 1000:\n        current_percent = (100*k)//1000\n        total_so_far = k\n        total_percent = (100*k)//2002\n\n   When does (100*k)//1000 == (100*k)//2002?\n\n   Let's check for k=0 (already done) and k from 1 to 1000.\n\n   We know that at k=0, both are 0.\n\n   Now, we note that the two percentages are equal only at certain k.\n\n   But note: the example says 50 and 99 are present.\n\n   Let's see 50: \n        We require (100*k)//1000 = 50 -> k must be 500 (since 100*500/1000=50, and floor(50) is 50).\n        Then total_so_far = 500, total_percent = (100*500)//2002 = 50000//2002 = 24 (because 2002*24=48048, 2002*25=50050 -> 50000 is between 48048 and 50050 -> 24). \n        So at k=500, the current file shows 50 and the overall shows 24 -> not equal.\n\n   Then how did 50 appear?\n\n   After the first file is done, we have k=1000 for the first file: \n        current_percent = (100*1000)//1000 = 100\n        total_so_far = 1000, total_percent = (100*1000)//2002 = 49 (because 100000//2002 = 49.95 -> 49)\n\n   Then we move to the second file (size 2). Then we copy the first byte of the second file (k=1 in the second file):\n        current_percent = (100*1)//2 = 50\n        total_so_far = 1000+1 = 1001\n        total_percent = (100*1001)//2002 = 100100//2002 = 50 (exactly: 2002*50 = 100100) -> 50.\n\n   So at k=1 (second byte overall) we have both at 50.\n\n   Similarly, 99 might appear later.\n\n   Now, why is 99 present?\n        We have to check when the overall percentage becomes 99. The total_so_far must satisfy: (100 * total_so_far) // 2002 = 99.\n        This means 99 <= (100 * total_so_far)/2002 < 100.\n        => 19818 <= total_so_far < 20020? But total_so_far cannot exceed 2002.\n\n        Actually, total_so_far must be at least ceil(99 * 2002 / 100) = ceil(19819.8) = 19820, and at most 2002.\n\n        Wait, 99 * 2002 = 198198, so total_so_far must be >= ceil(198198/100) ??? Let me recompute:\n\n        Condition: (100 * total_so_far) // 2002 = 99\n        => 99 * 2002 <= 100 * total_so_far < 100 * 2002? Actually, no.\n\n        The condition for floor division: \n            floor(100 * total_so_far / 2002) = 99\n        <=> 99 <= (100 * total_so_far) / 2002 < 100\n        <=> 99 * 2002 <= 100 * total_so_far < 100 * 2002\n        <=> 198198 <= 100 * total_so_far < 200200\n        <=> 1981.98 <= total_so_far < 2002.00\n\n        So total_so_far must be at least 1982 (because total_so_far is integer) and at most 2001 (because 2002 would give 100).\n\n        Now, the last file has size 998. The total_so_far at the end of the third file is 1000+2+2 = 1004, then we start the last file (998 bytes). \n\n        We require that at some point during the last file, the current file percentage equals 99.\n\n        Let x be the number of bytes copied in the last file (from 1 to 998). Then total_so_far = 1004 + x.\n\n        The current file percentage: (100*x)//998 = 99? \n            => 99 <= (100*x)/998 < 100\n            => 99*998 <= 100*x < 100*998\n            => 98802 <= 100*x < 99800\n            => 988.02 <= x < 998.00\n\n        So x must be at least 989 (since x is integer). Then total_so_far = 1004 + 989 = 1993.\n\n        Now, check the overall percentage: (100 * 1993) // 2002 = 199300 // 2002 = 99 (because 2002 * 99 = 198198, and 199300 - 198198 = 1102, so 99 + 1102/2002, which is less than 100). \n\n        Now, the current file percentage at x=989: (100*989)//998 = 98900//998 = 99 (because 998*99 = 98802, and 98900 - 98802 = 98, so 99 + 98/998, which floors to 99).\n\n        So at x=989 (so at the 989th byte of the last file) we get both at 99.\n\n   Similarly, 100 is achieved at the last byte of the last file.\n\nTherefore, we must iterate over each file and within each file, each byte.\n\nBut note: the total number of bytes is T (<=100000) and we are doing one pass for each byte, so maximum 100000 * (work per byte) which is acceptable in Python.\n\nHowever, note: the inner loop runs for each file, and the total number of bytes is the sum of the files, so we are iterating exactly T times (each byte is considered once). \n\nBut wait: the outer loop is over files, and the inner loop is from 1 to a_i. The total number of iterations is the sum of a_i for i from 0 to n-1, which is T. So that's acceptable.\n\nBut note: the example input \"6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100\" (last example) has T = 170+130+400+256+30+100 = 1286, so 1286 iterations.\n\nAlgorithm:\n\nn = int(input().strip())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal = sum(a)\n\n# We'll create a set to record all percentages that occur at some moment (including 0 and 100)\nfound = set()\n\n# Start with 0\nfound.add(0)\n\n# Keep track of the cumulative sum of the previous files\ncumulative = 0\n\nfor size in a:\n    # For the current file, we are going to consider k from 1 to size\n    # The current file's percentage at k bytes: (100 * k) // size\n    # The total_so_far = cumulative + k\n    # The overall percentage: (100 * (cumulative + k)) // total\n\n    # We iterate k from 1 to size\n    for k in range(1, size+1):\n        current_percent = (100 * k) // size\n        total_so_far = cumulative + k\n        total_percent = (100 * total_so_far) // total\n\n        if current_percent == total_percent:\n            found.add(current_percent)\n\n    # After processing the current file, update cumulative\n    cumulative += size\n\n# Also, note: at the very end (after the last byte) we have 100, but we will catch that when k=size in the last file, because then total_so_far = total, so (100 * total) // total = 100, and current_percent = (100 * size) // size = 100.\n\n# But we must output numbers from 0 to 100 that are in the set, in increasing order.\n\n# However, note: it is possible that a percentage between 0 and 100 is not achieved? Then we skip.\n\n# Now, we want to output all numbers in the set that are between 0 and 100 (inclusive) in increasing order.\n\n# But note: we started with 0, and we only add percentages that are integers from 0 to 100 (because k from 1 to size: current_percent is from 0 to 100, and total_percent is from 0 to 100).\n\n# So we can do:\n\n# Create a sorted list of the found set, but only those that are <=100 (they are, but just in case) and then filter.\n\n# Actually, we are only adding integers from 0 to 100.\n\n# But note: the example outputs sometimes don't include all numbers from 0 to 100, only the ones that occur.\n\n# Now, we must output the numbers in increasing order.\n\n# However, note: the example outputs: \n#   First example: 0,16,33,50,66,83,100\n#   Second example: 0,95,96,97,98,99,100\n\n# Let's run the first example: n=1, a=[6], total=6.\n\n# cumulative starts at 0.\n# Then for the file of size 6: k from 1 to 6.\n#   k=1: current_percent = (100*1)//6 = 16; total_so_far=1; total_percent=(100*1)//6=16 -> add 16.\n#   k=2: (200//6)=33; (200//6)=33 -> add 33.\n#   k=3: (300//6)=50 -> add 50.\n#   k=4: (400//6)=66 -> add 66.\n#   k=5: (500//6)=83 -> add 83.\n#   k=6: (600//6)=100 -> add 100.\n\n# Then we also started with 0.\n\n# So we have {0,16,33,50,66,83,100}.\n\n# Now, the second example: n=2, a=[100,500], total=600.\n\n# cumulative = 0\n# First file: size=100\n#   k from 1 to 100:\n#     We need to check when (100*k)//100 == (100*(k))//600 -> k == (600*k)//100 ? \n#     Actually: (100*k)//100 = k, and (100*k)//600 = floor(100*k/600) = floor(k/6)\n#     So we need k = floor(k/6) -> only k=0 (which we already have) and then k=0 is the start. \n#     But wait: k from 1 to 100: \n#         k=1: 1 vs 0 -> no.\n#         k=2: 2 vs 0 -> no.\n#         ... until k=6: 6 vs 1 -> no.\n#         k=7: 7 vs 1 -> no.\n\n#     Actually, we are looking for k such that k == (100*k)//600? \n#         k = (100*k)//600  => 600*k = 100*k * t?

Then, we want to output all numbers in the set that are between 0 and 100 (they are) in increasing order.\n\n# But note: the problem says \"Выведите эти числа в порядке возрастания.\"\n\n# However, the set might have numbers outside [0,100]? No, because k from 1 to size: current_percent = (100*k)//size is at most 100 (when k=size, then 100*size//size = 100). Similarly, total_percent is at most 100.\n\n# But what if we have a file of 0?

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all the percentages between 0 and 100 inclusive that appear simultaneously on both progress bars during the copying of files from one server to another. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, while the second progress bar shows the overall percentage of all files copied so far. Both percentages are updated after each byte is copied and are rounded down to the nearest integer.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves simulating the copying process of each file byte by byte. For each byte copied in a file, we calculate the current file's progress percentage and the overall progress percentage. If these two percentages match at any point during the copying process, that percentage is recorded.\n2. **Intuition**: By iterating through each file and each byte within the file, we can compute the relevant percentages at every step. The key insight is that the current file's progress depends only on the bytes copied within that file, while the overall progress depends on the cumulative bytes copied up to that point.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves a straightforward simulation of the copying process. For each file, we loop through each byte, compute the current and overall percentages, and check for equality. This approach efficiently captures all possible matching percentages without unnecessary complexity.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each byte of each file exactly once. Given that the total number of bytes across all files is at most 100,000 (since each file can be up to 1000 bytes and there are up to 100 files), the solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(T), where T is the total number of bytes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data: \n        return\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    total = sum(a)\n    \n    found = set([0])\n    cumulative = 0\n    \n    for size in a:\n        for k in range(1, size + 1):\n            current_percent = (100 * k) // size\n            total_so_far = cumulative + k\n            total_percent = (100 * total_so_far) // total\n            \n            if current_percent == total_percent:\n                found.add(current_percent)\n                \n        cumulative += size\n        \n    result = sorted(found)\n    \n    for num in result:\n        print(num)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of files and their respective sizes. These values are read from standard input.\n2. **Initialization**: A set `found` is initialized to keep track of all unique percentages encountered during the copying process, starting with 0 (the initial state before any copying begins).\n3. **Simulating Copying Process**: For each file, the code iterates over each byte (from 1 to the file's size). For each byte, it calculates the current file's progress percentage and the overall progress percentage. If these percentages match, the value is added to the set `found`.\n4. **Output**: After processing all files, the unique percentages in `found` are sorted in ascending order and printed, each on a new line.\n\nThis approach efficiently captures all valid percentages by leveraging direct simulation of the copying process, ensuring accuracy and simplicity.",
