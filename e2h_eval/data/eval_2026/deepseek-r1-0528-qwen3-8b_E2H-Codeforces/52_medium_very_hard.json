Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of used candles needed to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have 'a' candles. Each candle burns for 1 hour and then becomes a used candle.\n   - We can take 'b' used candles and convert them into one new candle (which can then be burned).\n\n How it works:\n   Let total_hours = 0\n   Let current_candles = a\n   Let leftover = 0   (this will be the used candles that we don't immediately convert)\n\n But note: we can burn the candles in cycles.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of it as:\n   In the first step: burn 'a' candles -> get 'a' hours and 'a' used candles.\n   Then, we can form floor(a / b) new candles from the used ones, and we'll have a % b leftover.\n\n However, note that when we form new candles from used ones, those new candles when burned will also become used and can be combined again.\n\n So we can do:\n\n   total = a   (this is the initial burning hours)\n   while a >= b:\n        new_candles = a // b\n        leftover = a % b\n        total += new_candles   # because each new candle gives one hour\n        a = new_candles + leftover   # now we have the new candles and the leftover\n\n   But wait: actually, when we use the used candles to form new ones, the entire set of used candles (which is a) is converted to new_candles = a//b and leftover = a % b.\n\n   Then we have the new candles (which we just made) and the leftover (the unused used candles). We can then burn the new_candles, which gives us new_candles hours and then we have (leftover + new_candles) used candles.\n\n   However, the above while loop condition is checking on the current value of 'a' (which was originally the number of candles we had). But note: in the next iteration, we are setting a to the new_candles + leftover, and then we continue.\n\n   Example: Input \"4 2\"\n        Start: a=4, total=4\n        Iteration1: 4>=2 -> new_candles=4//2=2, leftover=0. Then total becomes 4+2=6, and a becomes 2+0=2.\n        Iteration2: 2>=2 -> new_candles=2//2=1, leftover=0. Then total becomes 6+1=7, and a becomes 1+0=1.\n        Then 1<2 -> stop. Output 7.\n\n   Example: Input \"6 3\"\n        Start: a=6, total=6\n        Iteration1: 6>=3 -> new_candles=6//3=2, leftover=0. Then total becomes 6+2=8, a becomes 2+0=2.\n        Then 2<3 -> stop. Output 8.\n\n   This matches the examples.\n\n However, note that we can also write this without a while loop by using recursion or mathematical formulas, but the constraints (a and b up to 1000) are small so a while loop is acceptable.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n Steps:\n   Read the input, split into two integers: a and b.\n   Initialize total_hours = a (because we burn the initial a candles)\n   Set current = a   (current candles to burn, which will be updated to the remaining candles that we can burn in the next rounds)\n   While current >= b:\n        new_candles = current // b\n        remainder = current % b\n        total_hours += new_candles\n        current = new_candles + remainder\n\n   Print total_hours.\n\n But note: in the example, we start with a=4, b=2. \n   First iteration: current=4 -> new_candles=2, remainder=0 -> total_hours=4+2=6, current=2+0=2.\n   Second iteration: current=2 -> new_candles=1, remainder=0 -> total_hours=6+1=7, current=1+0=1 -> break.\n\n This is correct.\n\n However, consider another example: a=10, b=3\n   Step1: burn 10 -> total=10, then we have 10 used candles. \n        new_candles = 10//3 = 3, remainder=1 -> total=13, current=3+1=4.\n   Step2: burn 4 -> total=13+4=17? Actually no, wait: we don't burn the current candles until we convert them.\n\n But wait: our method does not account for burning the current candles at the beginning of the round. \n\n Actually, the way we did it is: \n   We started with a=10, and we burned the 10 initially (so 10 hours). Then we convert the 10 used candles to 3 new ones (and 1 leftover). Then we have 3+1=4 candles. Now, we can burn these 4 candles (each gives 1 hour) so that's 4 more hours. Then we have 4 used candles.\n\n   Then we convert the 4 used candles: 4//3 = 1 new candle and remainder 1 -> then we have 1+1=2 candles (which we burn for 2 more hours). Then we have 2 used candles, which is less than 3, so stop.\n\n   Total hours = 10 (first burn) + 4 (second burn) + 2 (third burn) = 16.\n\n   With our algorithm:\n        total_hours = 10\n        current = 10\n        Iteration1: 10>=3 -> new_candles=3, remainder=1 -> total_hours=10+3=13, current=3+1=4.\n        Iteration2: 4>=3 -> new_candles=1, remainder=1 -> total_hours=13+1=14, current=1+1=2.\n        Then stop. \n\n   Why did we get 14 and not 16?\n\n   The issue: Our algorithm is only counting the new candles we made (which give one hour each) but we are not accounting for the fact that the initial current (which was the used candles) was burned to get the new candles, and then the new candles are burned and then their used parts are added.\n\n   Actually, let's break down the steps:\n\n   We start with 10 candles. We burn all 10, so we get 10 hours. Then we have 10 used candles. Then we form 3 new candles (from 10//3) and leave 1 used candle. Now we have 3 new candles (which we can burn) and 1 leftover. \n\n   Now, we burn the 3 new candles: that gives 3 hours. Then we have 3 used candles from the new ones plus the 1 leftover: total 4 used candles.\n\n   Then we form 4//3=1 new candle and have 1 leftover. Then we burn that 1 new candle: 1 hour. Then we have 1 used candle from the last burn and the 1 leftover: total 2 used candles.\n\n   Then we stop.\n\n   So the total hours: 10 (first burn) + 3 (burning the first recycled batch) + 1 (burning the second recycled batch) = 14.\n\n   But wait, why did I say 16 earlier? Let me recount:\n\n   Step0: 10 candles -> burn for 10 hours, now we have 10 used candles.\n   Step1: from 10 used candles, we make 3 new candles and have 1 left. Then we burn the 3 new candles: 3 hours, now we have 3+1=4 used candles.\n   Step2: from 4 used candles, we make 1 new candle and have 1 left. Then we burn the 1 new candle: 1 hour, now we have 1+1=2 used candles.\n   Step3: we cannot make a new candle from 2.\n\n   Total: 10+3+1 = 14.\n\n   But in my initial breakdown I thought we were burning the current candles at the beginning of the round. Actually, the way the problem is defined: we can only burn one candle at a time and then it becomes used. However, the process is:\n\n   We have a stock of candles (both new and recycled). We burn as many as we have until we run out, but we can also recycle.\n\n   However, note that the problem says: \"Vasily can make b went out candles into a new candle.\" So he does this after the burning.\n\n   The key is: we don't necessarily burn all the candles we have at once. But the problem doesn't specify the order. However, Vasily acts optimally. He would want to maximize the hours.\n\n   The optimal strategy is to burn as many as possible and then recycle. But note: burning a candle gives one hour and then produces one used candle. So if we have x candles, we can burn them all (x hours) and then we have x used candles to recycle.\n\n   Therefore, the process is:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   current = a\n   while current > 0:\n        # Burn all the current candles (we have current candles)\n        total_hours += current\n        # Now we have current used candles\n        # Recycle: how many new candles can we make?\n        new_candles = current // b\n        remainder = current % b\n        # After recycling, we have new_candles (to burn) and remainder (used candles that are not enough to form a new one)\n        current = new_candles + remainder   # because we are going to burn the new_candles in the next cycle\n\n   However, wait: in the example \"4 2\":\n        Start: current=4, total_hours=4\n        Then we have 4 used candles -> new_candles=4//2=2, remainder=0 -> current=2\n        Next: total_hours=4+2=6, then 2//2=1, remainder=0 -> current=1, total_hours=6+1=7 -> then 1<2 -> stop.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   But for \"10 3\":\n        Start: current=10, total_hours=10\n        Then: new_candles=10//3=3, remainder=1 -> current=3+1=4, total_hours=13\n        Then: current=4, total_hours=13+4=17 -> then new_candles=4//3=1, remainder=1 -> current=1+1=2, total_hours=18\n        Then: current=2, total_hours=18+2=20 -> then new_candles=2//3=0, remainder=2 -> current=0+2=2 -> infinite loop?\n\n   That's not right. We are burning the same candle twice? \n\n   Actually, the mistake: When we burn the current candles, we are effectively burning the entire stock. Then we get current used candles. Then we convert the used candles to new ones. Then we set current to the new ones plus any leftover used candles. Then we burn that entire stock again.\n\n   But in the example \"10 3\", after the first burn (10 candles) we get 10 used candles, then we form 3 new candles (using 9 of the used ones) and have 1 leftover. Then we have 3+1=4 candles (which are new) to burn. Then we burn those 4, getting 4 used candles. Then we form 1 new candle (from 3 of the used ones) and have 1 leftover. Then we have 1+1=2 candles. Then we burn the 2, getting 2 used candles, which is less than b (3), so we stop.\n\n   However, in the code above, after burning the 4, we set current to 4 (which we then add to total_hours). Then we process the 4: making 1 new and leaving 1, so current becomes 2. Then we burn the 2, adding 2 to total_hours, then we try to process the 2: 2//3=0, remainder=2, so current becomes 0+2=2 -> then we burn the 2 again and again.\n\n   This is an infinite loop.\n\n   The problem: We should not burn the same candle twice. In reality, after we use a candle to produce a new one, that candle is consumed. But note: the way we model is that we have a stock of candles (both new and recycled). The burning process consumes the entire stock, then we recycle the entire stock (all used candles). \n\n   However, when we burn the candles, we are using them and then they become used. Then we use the used ones to make new ones. The new ones are distinct from the old ones.\n\n   The correct way is:\n\n        total_hours = 0\n        current = a   # initial candles (which are new)\n        while current > 0:\n            # Burn all the current candles (each gives one hour)\n            total_hours += current\n            # Now, we have 'current' used candles (since each burned candle becomes one used)\n            # Now, we convert the used candles: each b used candles make one new candle.\n            new_candles = current // b\n            remainder = current % b\n            current = new_candles   # because the used candles are now converted to new_candles (and we don't keep the remainder as current? Actually, the remainder is lost? No, wait: the problem says we can only convert b at a time, and we have current used candles. The remainder is the leftover used candles that we cannot convert.\n\n            But note: the problem doesn't say we lose the remainder. We have the remainder as used candles that are not enough to form a new candle. However, we can mix these with future used candles.\n\n            However, in the example, after burning the initial 10, we have 10 used candles. Then we form 3 new candles (using 9) and we have 1 leftover used candle. Then we burn the 3 new candles (so we get 3 hours) and then we have 3+1=4 used candles.\n\n            So the current for the next iteration should be the new_candles (which we just burned) plus the remainder (the unused used candles). But wait: we just burned the new_candles, so we have new_candles used candles from that burning, plus the remainder from before.\n\n            However, in our code we are setting current to the number of candles we have to burn in the next round. After burning, we have used the current candles and then we get a pool of used candles (which is current) and we convert that pool. Then the next round's candles are the new ones we made (new_candles) and we don't have the remainder as part of the next round? Actually, the remainder is kept as used candles that we haven't converted, but then we burn the new_candles and get new used candles.\n\n            The key is: the entire stock of candles (whether new or recycled) is what we burn. But the recycling process uses the used candles. So the state is the number of candles (new or old) we have, and when we burn them we get an equal number of used candles.\n\n            Then we convert all the used candles we have (from the previous burning) into new ones. And then the next state is the new ones we made.\n\n            However, note: we don't have to wait until the entire burning is done to start recycling? But the problem says we act optimally. The optimal way is to burn as many as we have and then recycle.\n\n            But the problem doesn't specify that we must burn all at once. However, to maximize the hours, we burn all available candles at the moment, because burning a candle gives one hour and then we can use the used candle later.\n\n            The process:\n\n                Hour 0: We have a new candles.\n                For the first a hours: we burn one candle per hour. At hour a, we have burned a candles and have a used candles.\n\n                Now, we can convert the a used candles into floor(a/b) new candles and have r = a % b used candles left.\n\n                Then, we can burn these floor(a/b) new candles, giving floor(a/b) additional hours.\n\n                Then, we have floor(a/b) + r used candles (from the new ones and the leftovers). Then we can convert again.\n\n            So the total hours is the sum of all the candles we ever burn.\n\n            How to compute without simulating every burn?\n\n            We can simulate by:\n\n                total = 0\n                current = a\n                while current > 0:\n                    total += current   # burn all current candles\n                    # Now, we have 'current' used candles\n                    current = current // b + (current % b != 0 ? ... )   -> Actually, we don't have the remainder as current candles, because the remainder is used candles that are not enough to form a new candle. But wait, in the next round, we are going to burn the new_candles (which we made from the used ones) and then we will have more used candles.\n\n            Alternatively, we can think of the entire process as:\n\n                total_hours = 0\n                candles = a\n                while candles >= b:\n                    # We can use 'candles' used candles to make new ones, but wait: we are going to burn the candles first.\n\n                Actually, we are burning the candles, so the above while loop condition is not directly on the used candles.\n\n            Let me reframe:\n\n                Let x0 = a   (initial candles)\n                Then we burn x0 -> hours = x0, and we get x0 used candles.\n                Then we make x1 = x0 // b new candles, and we have r0 = x0 % b used candles left.\n                Then we burn x1 -> hours = x0 + x1, and we get x1 + r0 used candles (because we burned x1 and got x1 used, and we still have r0).\n                Then we make x2 = (x1+r0) // b, and r1 = (x1+r0) % b.\n                Then we burn x2 -> hours = x0+x1+x2, and we get x2 + r1 used candles.\n\n            So the algorithm:\n\n                total = a\n                current = a\n                while current >= b:\n                    # We can form new_candles from the current used candles (but wait, we don't have current as used candles, we have current as the candles we have to burn, which are new or recycled)\n\n                Actually, we are mixing the concept. Let's define:\n\n                Let 'burned' = 0\n                Let 'inventory' = a   (the candles we have at the beginning, which are new)\n\n                Then we burn all the inventory -> burned += inventory, then we have 'inventory' used candles.\n\n                Then we form new_candles = inventory // b, and we leave r = inventory % b used candles.\n\n                Then we set inventory = new_candles   (because we are going to burn these new_candles in the next round) but wait, we have the leftover r used candles that we haven't burned? Actually, no: the leftover r used candles are separate. However, we can combine the used candles from multiple burns.\n\n                But note: the problem allows us to use the used candles as they come. We don't have to wait until the entire burn is done. However, the optimal strategy is to burn all we have and then recycle.\n\n                Actually, the process is:\n\n                Step 1: Burn all the candles we have (which are 'inventory') -> this gives 'inventory' hours and we get 'inventory' used candles.\n                Step 2: Convert the used candles into new ones: new_candles = inventory // b, and we have r = inventory % b used candles left over (which we cannot convert).\n                Step 3: Now, we have new_candles candles (which we can burn) and we can also keep the leftover r used candles for future conversion.\n\n                Then the next inventory is the new_candles + r? \n\n                But wait, in the next burn, we are going to burn the new_candles and then we will get new_candles used candles, and then we add the leftover r (if we didn't already use them) to form the next set.\n\n                However, the problem is: we are allowed to use the leftover r in the next conversion. So the state for the next burn should be the new_candles (which we just made) and we still have the leftover r (which we didn't use in the conversion). Then when we burn the new_candles, we get new_candles used candles, and then we combine that with the leftover r to form the next conversion.\n\n                Therefore, we should keep track of the total used candles (or the total candles we have, which is the sum of new candles and the leftover from previous conversion).\n\n                Alternatively, we can combine the process:\n\n                total_hours = 0\n                candles = a   # this is the number of candles we have (both new and recycled) at the start of a cycle\n                while candles >= b or (candles < b and ...?): Actually, we can only convert when we have at least b candles? Not exactly, because we are burning and then converting.\n\n                Let me try with the example \"10 3\":\n\n                Cycle0: \n                    candles = 10\n                    total_hours += 10 -> 10\n                    used_candles = 10\n                    new_candles = 10 // 3 = 3, leftover_used = 10 % 3 = 1\n                    Then we set candles = 3 (the new ones) and we keep the 1 leftover? Actually, no: the 1 leftover is a used candle that we haven't burned. But we are going to burn the 3 new ones in the next cycle.\n\n                Cycle1:\n                    candles = 3\n                    total_hours += 3 -> 13\n                    used_candles = 3\n                    new_candles = 3 // 3 = 1, leftover_used = 0\n                    Then we set candles = 1 (from the new ones) and we have no leftover? But wait, we burned 3 candles and got 3 used, then we converted all 3 used (so no leftover). Then we have 1 new candle.\n\n                Cycle2:\n                    candles = 1\n                    total_hours += 1 -> 14\n                    used_candles = 1\n                    new_candles = 1 // 3 = 0, leftover_used = 1\n                    Then we set candles = 0 (because we don't get any new candle) but we still have 1 leftover used candle? \n\n                However, we cannot use the leftover used candle by itself (since we need b=3). So we stop.\n\n                But note: the leftover from the conversion is stored separately. We must remember that we have some leftover used candles that we haven't burned. \n\n                The problem is: we are burning the candles (which are the ones we have, including the new ones and the leftovers from previous conversions?) \n\n                Actually, the process is:\n\n                    We start with a new candles (a).\n                    We burn them: so we have a hours and a used candles.\n                    Then we convert the a used candles: we get floor(a/b) new candles and leave a % b used candles.\n\n                    Now, we have two types of candles: the new ones (floor(a/b)) and the leftover used candles (a % b). But the leftover used candles are not new candles, so we cannot burn them until we have enough to form a new candle? Actually, we can burn the new candles, but the leftover used candles are not burned until they are part of a conversion?\n\n                This is confusing.\n\n                Let me read the problem statement: \"Vasily can make b went out candles into a new candle.\" \n\n                So the used candles (went out) are the ones that are burned. The leftover used candles are also went out candles? Yes, because we burned them? \n\n                Wait, no: in the first cycle, we burned the initial a candles and then we have a used candles. Then we convert the a used candles (all of them) to new candles. Then we burn the new candles, and then we have new used candles.\n\n                But in the conversion, we are using the used candles. So the leftover is the used candles that we didn't use for conversion. These leftover used candles are still available to be burned? Or are they considered as wasted?\n\n                The problem doesn't say. But note: the example \"4 2\" does not mention having leftover used candles that are not burned. \n\n                Actually, the process is: \n                    You burn a candle -> it becomes used.\n                    You can then take b used candles and turn them into one new candle.\n\n                So the leftover used candles are still there and can be burned again? \n\n                However, the example \"4 2\": \n                    Start with 4 new candles -> burn them (4 hours) -> 4 used candles.\n                    Then convert 4 used candles into 2 new candles (because 4//2=2) -> no leftover.\n                    Then burn the 2 new candles (2 hours) -> 2 used candles.\n                    Then convert 2 used candles into 1 new candle (2//2=1) -> no leftover.\n                    Then burn the 1 new candle (1 hour) -> 1 used candle (which cannot be converted).\n\n                Total: 4+2+1=7.\n\n                Now, consider if we kept the leftover used candles: \n\n                Example \"10 3\": \n                    Start: 10 new -> burn 10 -> 10 used.\n                    Convert 10 used: 10//3=3 new, and 1 leftover used.\n                    Then we burn the 3 new -> 3 hours -> 3 used, so total used now is 1 (leftover) + 3 (from burning) = 4.\n                    Convert 4 used: 4//3=1 new, and 1 leftover.\n                    Then burn the 1 new -> 1 hour -> 1 used, so total used now is 1 (leftover) + 1 (from burning) = 2.\n                    Then we stop.\n\n                Total: 10+3+1 = 14.\n\n                But if we don't consider the leftover used candles until the next conversion, then we are effectively treating them as part of the stock for the next conversion. However, the problem is that we are burning the new candles and then we have to account for the used candles from the new ones.\n\n                The key is: we are allowed to use the leftover used candles from previous conversions as part of the pool of used candles for the next conversion.\n\n                Therefore, we need to keep track of two things:\n                    - The candles we have that are ready to burn (which are the new candles we made from conversion, and possibly the leftover from previous conversions? Actually, no: the leftover from previous conversions are used candles, and we can burn them to get more used candles.\n\n                But wait, we can burn any candle (whether it was new or recycled) and then it becomes used. However, the problem says that we can only convert used candles (went out candles) to new ones.\n\n                So the process:\n\n                    We have a stock of candles (both new and recycled) that we can burn. We burn them one by one (each gives one hour) and then they become used. Then we use the used candles to make new ones.\n\n                Therefore, the entire stock (regardless of origin) is burned together. \n\n                We can model:\n\n                    Let x0 = a   (initial new candles)\n                    Then we burn x0 -> get x0 hours and x0 used candles.\n                    Then we convert the x0 used candles to new ones: new_candles = x0 // b, and leftover_used = x0 % b.\n\n                    Now, we have new_candles new candles and leftover_used used candles.\n\n                    But note: we can burn the new_candles and the leftover_used? No, we can only burn the new_candles (because the leftover_used are already used and we don't burn them again until we convert them? Actually, we can burn the leftover_used as well? \n\n                The problem does not say we cannot burn the leftover_used. But note: the leftover_used are already burned (they were used candles from the previous burn). So we cannot burn them again because they are already burned.\n\n                This is the confusion.\n\n                Actually, the process is:\n\n                    You have a collection of candles (some are new, some are recycled). You burn one candle per hour. When you burn a candle, it goes out and becomes a used candle.\n\n                    Then, whenever you have b used candles, you can convert them into one new candle.\n\n                So the steps:\n\n                    Step 1: You have 10 new candles. You burn 10 candles (over 10 hours) and now you have 10 used candles.\n\n                    Step 2: From the 10 used candles, you make 3 new candles (because 10//3=3) and you have 1 used candle left.\n\n                    Step 3: Now you have 3 new candles. You burn these 3 (over 3 hours) and now you have 3+1=4 used candles.\n\n                    Step 4: From the 4 used candles, you make 1 new candle (4//3=1) and you have 1 used candle left.\n\n                    Step 5: Now you have 1 new candle. You burn it (1 hour) and now you have 1+1=2 used candles.\n\n                    Step 6: Cannot make a new candle from 2 used candles.\n\n                    Total hours: 10+3+1 = 14.\n\n                Therefore, the state is the number of new candles we have (which we can burn) and the number of used candles we have (which we can convert or burn? Actually, we don't burn the used candles again until they are part of the stock for burning? \n\n                But wait, in step 3, after burning the 3 new candles, we have 3 used candles from that burning plus the 1 leftover from the previous conversion -> 4 used candles.\n\n                So the used candles are accumulated and then converted.\n\n                How do we model the stock?\n\n                We have two types of candles: \n                    - New candles: which we can burn.\n                    - Used candles: which we can convert.\n\n                But note: after burning a candle, it becomes used. And we can use the used candles to make new ones.\n\n                Therefore, we can think of the entire process as:\n\n                    Let new = a   (initial new candles)\n                    Let used = 0  (initial used candles)\n\n                    Then, while new > 0 or used >= b:\n                        If new > 0:\n                            We burn one new candle -> new decreases by 1, used increases by 1, and total_hours increases by 1.\n                        Else if used >= b:\n                            We convert b used candles into 1 new candle: used decreases by b, new increases by 1.\n\n                    But this simulation is too slow if a is large (though a is at most 1000).\n\n                Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                    total_hours = 0\n                    new = a\n                    used = 0\n\n                    while new > 0 or used >= b:\n                        if new > 0:\n                            # Burn one new candle\n                            new -= 1\n                            used += 1\n                            total_hours += 1\n                        elif used >= b:\n                            used -= b\n                            new += 1\n\n                However, this does one candle at a time and might be inefficient for large numbers, but a is at most 1000 and b is at least 2, so the maximum total_hours is around 1000 * (some factor) which is acceptable.\n\n                Let's test with \"4 2\":\n                    new=4, used=0\n                    Iterations:\n                      Burn one new: new=3, used=1, hours=1\n                      Burn one new: new=2, used=2, hours=2 -> now we can convert: used>=2 -> convert: used=0, new=1 -> then we burn the new one: new=0, used=1, hours=3 -> then we cannot convert (used=1<2) and new=0 -> stop. -> total_hours=3, but expected is 7.\n\n                This simulation is not matching.\n\n                Why? Because in the example, we burn all the candles at once? Actually, the problem doesn't specify the order. But the optimal strategy is to burn as many as possible and then convert.\n\n                However, the above simulation burns one by one and then converts as soon as there are b used. But we can also burn multiple at once.\n\n                Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                    while new > 0 or used >= b:\n                        if new > 0:\n                            # Burn as many new candles as we want at once? \n                            # But note: we can only burn one per hour. However, we are allowed to burn one candle per hour.\n\n                            # But the problem doesn't require to simulate hour by hour. We can burn all new candles at once.\n\n                    Actually, the problem is: we have a fixed number of hours, and each candle burns for one hour.\n\n                We need to burn candles until we cannot burn any more. But we can also convert used candles to new ones during the process.\n\n                Let me try a different approach:\n\n                    We know that every time we burn a candle, we get one hour and one used candle.\n\n                    Then, we can use b used candles to make one candle (which then gives one more hour and one more used candle).\n\n                    Essentially, one candle can be burned and then the used candle can be combined with others to form new candles.\n\n                    Consider: \n                        One candle: burns for 1 hour, and then we have 1 used candle -> which is worth 1/b of a new candle.\n\n                    But then the new candle burns for 1 hour and gives 1 used candle, which is then 1/b, etc.\n\n                    So the total hours from one candle is:\n\n                        1 + 1/b + 1/b^2 + ... \n\n                    But we have a initial candles, so total_hours = a * (1 + 1/b + 1/b^2 + ...) \n\n                    However, this is a geometric series: a * (1/(1-1/b)) = a * (b/(b-1))\n\n                    But wait: for a=4, b=2: 4 * (2/1)=8, but expected is 7.\n\n                    Why? Because we cannot use fractional candles.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can simulate by:\n\n                        total = a\n                        while a >= b:\n                            a = a // b   # number of new candles we make\n                            total += a   # because we burn these a candles\n\n                        But wait, this is similar to the first code we wrote, and for a=4, b=2: \n                            total=4, then a=4//2=2 -> total=6, then a=2//2=1 -> total=7, then a=0 -> stop.\n\n                        This matches.\n\n                    However, for a=10, b=3:\n                            total=10\n                            a=10//3=3 -> total=13\n                            a=3//3=1 -> total=14\n                            a=1//3=0 -> stop.\n\n                    This gives 14, which matches.\n\n                    But wait, what about the used candles from the last conversion? In the example \"10 3\", after the first conversion we have 10//3=3 new candles and 10%3=1 used candle left. Then we burn the 3 new candles (which gives 3 hours) and then we have 3 used candles from these, plus the 1 leftover -> 4 used candles. Then we convert 4//3=1 new candle and 4%3=1 used candle left. Then we burn the 1 new candle -> 1 hour, and then we have 1 used candle from that and the 1 leftover -> 2 used candles.\n\n                    In the above algorithm, we did:\n\n                        total = 10\n                        a = 10 // 3 = 3 -> total=13\n                        a = 3 // 3 = 1 -> total=14\n\n                    But in the detailed simulation, we had two more steps: \n                        After the first conversion, we have 3 new candles and 1 used candle.\n                        Then we burn the 3 new candles -> then we have 3 used candles (from the 3 new) plus the 1 used -> 4 used candles.\n\n                    In the above algorithm, the variable 'a' is being set to the number of new candles we make, and then we add that to total_hours (which is the total burning hours). But we are not accounting for the leftover used candles in the next iteration.\n\n                    In the algorithm, after the first iteration, a becomes 3 (the new candles) and then we add 3 to total. Then we set a = 3//3 = 1 (the new candles from the 3 used candles) and add 1. \n\n                    But in the detailed simulation, after burning the 3 new candles, we have 3 used candles (from the 3 new) and then we combine with the 1 leftover to make 4 used candles. Then we convert 4 used candles to 1 new candle.\n\n                    In the algorithm, the next iteration uses the 3 new candles (which are burned and then become used) but we don't account for the leftover used candles from the previous conversion.\n\n                    The algorithm above does:\n\n                        total = a   [then we do conversions]\n\n                    But note: the initial a is the number of candles we have. Then we convert the used candles (",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The key observation here is that each candle burns for one hour and then becomes a used candle. Vasily can then convert `b` used candles into a new candle, which can be burned again. The goal is to maximize the total burning time by efficiently recycling the used candles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with `a` initial candles. Each candle provides one hour of light.\n2. **Recycling Process**: After burning all current candles, recycle the used candles into new ones. Specifically, every `b` used candles can be converted into one new candle.\n3. **Iterative Process**: Continue burning the new candles and recycling the used ones until there are fewer than `b` used candles left, making further conversion impossible.\n4. **Summing Hours**: Accumulate the total hours from each burning phase (both initial and recycled candles).\n\nThe algorithm involves:\n- Initializing the total hours to the number of initial candles.\n- While there are enough used candles (`current_candles >= b`) to form new candles:\n  - Calculate the number of new candles (`new_candles = current_candles // b`).\n  - Add these new candles to the total hours.\n  - Update `current_candles` to the sum of new candles and the remainder from division (`current_candles % b`).\n- The loop terminates when `current_candles` is insufficient to form any more new candles.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning and recycling candles in cycles, ensuring optimal use of available resources.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    total_hours = a\n    current = a\n    while current >= b:\n        new_candles = current // b\n        total_hours += new_candles\n        current = new_candles + (current % b)\n    print(total_hours)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` (initial candles) and `b` (number of used candles needed to make a new one).\n2. **Initialization**: `total_hours` starts with `a` because each initial candle provides one hour of light.\n3. **Loop for Recycling**: The loop continues as long as there are enough used candles (`current`) to form at least one new candle (`current >= b`).\n   - **New Candles Calculation**: `new_candles` is the integer division of `current` by `b`, representing how many new candles can be made.\n   - **Update Total Hours**: Each new candle adds one hour to `total_hours`.\n   - **Update Current Candles**: The remaining candles are the sum of new candles and the remainder from the division (`current % b`), which are the leftover used candles that couldn't form another new candle.\n4. **Termination**: The loop exits when `current` is less than `b`, meaning no more new candles can be formed.\n5. **Output**: The total accumulated hours is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the problem by iteratively processing each cycle of burning and recycling, ensuring the maximum possible hours are obtained.",
