Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of used candles needed to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have 'a' candles. Each candle burns for 1 hour and then becomes a used candle.\n   - We can take 'b' used candles and convert them into one new candle (which can then be burned).\n\n How the process goes?\n   - First, we burn as many new candles as we have. Let's say we start with 'a' candles.\n   - We burn them all, so we get 'a' hours and we now have 'a' used candles.\n\n   Then, while we have at least 'b' used candles, we can convert some of them into new candles.\n   For example, if we have n used candles, we can make floor(n / b) new candles, and we will be left with n % b used candles.\n\n   Then we can burn these new candles, which gives us more used candles, and we can repeat the process.\n\n However, note that the burning process is sequential. We can think of it as:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_candles = a   (which are new)\n   leftover = 0          (used candles that haven't been converted)\n\n   But note: when we burn the initial candles, they become used. Then we use the used ones to make new ones.\n\n Alternatively, we can simulate:\n\n   Step 1: Burn all the new candles (which are initially 'a') -> total_hours += a, and we now have a used candles.\n\n   Then, while we have at least 'b' used candles:\n        new_candles = (used_candles) // b\n        leftover = (used_candles) % b\n\n        Then, we can burn these new_candles, so we add new_candles to total_hours.\n        And then we update the used_candles: we have the leftover from the previous conversion plus the new_candles that just burned (so they become used) but wait, no:\n\n        Actually, after making new_candles from the used_candles, we are left with leftover. Then we burn the new_candles, which turns them into used ones. So the next set of used_candles is leftover + new_candles (because the new_candles we made and then burned become used).\n\n        However, note: we don't need to keep the leftover from the previous step separately because we are going to use all the used candles (leftover and the new ones we just burned) for the next conversion.\n\n   But let me reframe:\n\n   total_used = 0   (this will accumulate the used candles, which can be converted)\n   total_hours = 0\n\n   We start with 'a' new candles. We can burn them, so we do:\n\n   total_hours += a\n   total_used += a   (since we have a used candles)\n\n   Then, while total_used >= b:\n        new_candles = total_used // b\n        remainder = total_used % b\n\n        total_hours += new_candles\n        total_used = remainder + new_candles   (because the new_candles we made are burned, so they become used)\n\n   This simulation is straightforward.\n\n Example: Input \"4 2\"\n\n   Start: total_hours=0, total_used=0.\n\n   Burn 4: total_hours=4, total_used=4.\n\n   Now, since 4>=2 -> new_candles=4//2=2, remainder=0.\n        total_hours=6, total_used=0+2=2.\n\n   Then 2>=2 -> new_candles=2//2=1, remainder=0.\n        total_hours=7, total_used=0+1=1 -> then stop.\n\n   Output 7.\n\n Example: Input \"6 3\"\n\n   Start: total_hours=6, total_used=6.\n\n   Then: 6//3=2, remainder=0 -> total_hours=8, total_used=2.\n   Then 2<3 -> stop.\n\n   Output 8.\n\n However, wait: the example output is 8.\n\n But note: in the first example, the sample input was ['4 2','6 3'] and outputs ['7','8'].\n\n However, note that the problem says: \n     \"For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out, Vasily can make another candle.\"\n\n So after the first four hours, he has 4 used candles. He makes 4//2 = 2 new candles. Then he burns those two, so that's 2 more hours (total 6). Then he has 2 used candles from the two burned ones. Then he uses 2 used candles to make 1 new candle. Then he burns that one for 1 hour (total ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The key observation here is that each candle burns for one hour and then becomes a used candle. These used candles can be combined in groups of `b` to create new candles, which can then be burned again. The process continues until there are not enough used candles left to form a new candle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Burning**: Start by burning all the initial candles. This gives us `a` hours of light and generates `a` used candles.\n2. **Recycling Used Candles**: While there are at least `b` used candles, convert them into new candles. For every `b` used candles, we can make one new candle. The number of new candles is the integer division of the current used candles by `b`. The remaining used candles after this conversion are the modulus of the division.\n3. **Update Hours and Used Candles**: Each new candle provides an additional hour of light. After burning these new candles, they become used candles again, so we add their count to the remaining used candles from the previous step.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when the number of used candles is less than `b`, meaning no more new candles can be made. The total hours burned up to this point is the answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    total_hours = 0\n    used_candles = 0\n\n    total_hours += a\n    used_candles += a\n\n    while used_candles >= b:\n        new_candles = used_candles // b\n        remainder = used_candles % b\n        total_hours += new_candles\n        used_candles = remainder + new_candles\n\n    print(total_hours)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` (initial candles) and `b` (number of used candles needed to make a new candle).\n2. **Initial Setup**: The initial burning of `a` candles gives `a` hours of light and generates `a` used candles.\n3. **Loop for Recycling**: The loop continues as long as there are enough used candles (`used_candles >= b`) to make new candles. In each iteration:\n   - **Calculate New Candles**: The number of new candles is the quotient of dividing the used candles by `b`.\n   - **Update Used Candles**: The remaining used candles after conversion are the remainder of the division. The new candles, after burning, contribute to the used candles pool along with the remainder.\n4. **Output Result**: The total hours accumulated from burning all initial and recycled candles is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning and recycling candles until no more new candles can be made, ensuring optimal use of available resources.",
