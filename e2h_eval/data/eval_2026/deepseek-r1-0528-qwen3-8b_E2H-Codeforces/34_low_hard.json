And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read the first line to get n and k.\n Then, read the next line which has n integers.\n\n There are (n - k + 1) weeks. Each week is k consecutive days.\n\n We need to compute the average sleep time over all weeks.\n\n However, note that the total sum of sleep over all weeks is not simply the same as:\n   total = (a1 + a2 + ... + an) * (k-1) / something? \n But wait, actually we can use a sliding window.\n\n Let S be the total sum for one week (the first week: days 0 to k-1). Then the next week is from day1 to dayk, etc.\n\n The total sum for all weeks is:\n   week0: [0, k-1] -> sum0\n   week1: [1, k]   -> sum0 - a0 + a[k]\n   week2: [2, k+1] -> sum0 - a0 + a[k] - a[1] + a[k+1]\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute a prefix sum array to quickly calculate the sum for any contiguous segment.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read n, k and the list of sleep times.\n 2. Precompute prefix sums: \n        prefix[i] = a0 + a1 + ... + a{i-1}\n    Then the sum for days l to r is prefix[r+1] - prefix[l].\n\n 3. For each week i (from 0 to n-k), the week covers days i to i+k-1.\n    So the sum for week i is: prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n 4. Then the total sum of all weeks is the sum of these (n-k+1) values.\n\n 5. The average is total_sum / (n - k + 1)\n\n However, note: the example input \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\" gives 7 weeks.\n\n But wait, if we do:\n\n   total_weeks = 0\n   for i in range(0, n - k + 1):\n        total_weeks += (prefix[i+k] - prefix[i])\n\n But note: the above loop is O(n) and n can be up to 200000, which is acceptable.\n\n However, we can also use the prefix sum array and then:\n\n   total_sum = 0\n   for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n        total_sum += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n But note: the prefix array is built with length n+1, so we have to build it properly.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a single pass to compute the entire sum without nested loops?\n\n Actually, we can compute the total sum by:\n\n   total_sum = 0\n   for i in range(k): \n        # For the first week, we have the entire window from 0 to k-1.\n        # Then, for the next weeks, we subtract the element leaving and add the new one?\n        # But the problem asks for the average over all weeks.\n\n Another way: \n\n   total_sum = 0\n   # First, compute the sum of the first window [0, k-1]\n   s = 0\n   for i in range(k):\n        s += a[i]\n\n   total_sum = s\n   # Then for each next week, we remove a[i] and add a[i+k] for i from 0 to n-k-1\n   for i in range(0, n-k):\n        s = s - a[i] + a[i+k]\n        total_sum += s\n\n Then average = total_sum / (n - k + 1)\n\n This is more efficient because we only traverse once for the initial window and then one more for the rest.\n\n But note: n-k+1 weeks, so we do k + (n-k) = n steps, which is O(n).\n\n However, the constraints say n up to 200000, so both methods are acceptable.\n\n Let's choose the second method to avoid building a prefix array (if we don't want to use extra memory) but the problem size is acceptable.\n\n But note: we are already storing the list of n integers, so building a prefix array would be another n+1 integers. Since n is 200000, that's acceptable.\n\n But the problem does not require saving memory, so we can use either.\n\n However, let me write the code using the sliding window to avoid two passes (one for prefix and one for summing the windows) and to be clear.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\"\n   n=3, k=2, a = [3,4,7]\n\n   First window: [3,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a given sequence of days. A week is defined as k consecutive days, and there are (n - k + 1) such weeks in the sequence. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of sleep times for each week and then finding the average.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to compute the average sleep time over all overlapping windows of size k in an array of length n. Each window represents a week, and the average is the sum of all weekly sleep times divided by the number of weeks.\n2. **Intuition**: The straightforward approach would involve calculating the sum of each window separately, but this would be inefficient for large n (up to 200,000). Instead, we use a sliding window technique to compute the sum of each window in constant time after the initial window setup.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Sliding Window Technique**: First, compute the sum of the initial window (first k elements). Then, for each subsequent window, adjust the sum by subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters. This reduces the computation from O(n*k) to O(n), which is crucial for handling large inputs efficiently.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each element exactly twice (once for the initial window and once for each subsequent adjustment), resulting in a linear time complexity of O(n). The space complexity is O(n) to store the input array, which is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    if total_weeks == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n        \n    total_sum = 0\n    s = sum(a[:k])\n    total_sum += s\n    \n    for i in range(1, total_weeks):\n        s = s - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n        total_sum += s\n        \n    average = total_sum / total_weeks\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of days (n), the length of a week (k), and the sequence of sleep times for each day.\n2. **Initial Setup**: The total number of weeks is calculated as `n - k + 1`. If there are no weeks (n < k), the result is trivially 0.\n3. **Sliding Window Calculation**: The sum of the first window (first k elements) is computed. For each subsequent window, the sum is adjusted by removing the leftmost element of the previous window and adding the new rightmost element. This adjusted sum is added to the total sum of all weekly sleep times.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The average is computed by dividing the total sum of all weekly sleep times by the number of weeks. The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average using a sliding window technique, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
