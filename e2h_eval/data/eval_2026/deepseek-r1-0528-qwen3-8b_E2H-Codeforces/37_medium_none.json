    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed that n is at most 22, so we can try to use backtracking or meet-in-middle for generating the permutation.\n However, note: the problem requires that for every non-empty proper subset S (i.e., not empty and not the entire set) of the indices, \n the sum of the elements in a at positions S and the sum of the elements in b at positions S are different.\n\n Since b is a permutation of a, the entire set sum will be the same. But note: the condition excludes the entire set, so we don't require that the entire set has distinct sums? \n Actually, the condition says \"non-empty subset\" but then specifies \"0 < k < n\", so the entire set (k = n) is excluded. Therefore, we only care about subsets with size from 1 to n-1.\n\n Important: The condition must hold for every non-empty subset (with size from 1 to n-1). This is a very strong condition.\n\n Observation: \n   Let A be the array a, and B be the array b (a permutation of A). For any subset S (with size k, 1<=k<=n-1), let:\n        sum_A(S) = sum of elements of A at indices in S\n        sum_B(S) = sum of elements of B at indices in S\n\n   We require that for all S (non-empty proper subsets) we have: sum_A(S) != sum_B(S)\n\n How can we achieve this?\n\n Note: The entire set has the same total (since they are permutations). But the condition does not require that the entire set is excluded from the check? Actually, the problem states:\n        \"for every non-empty subset of indices S = {x1, x2, ..., xk} (1 ≤ xi ≤ n, 0 < k < n)\"\n\n So the entire set (k = n) is excluded.\n\n However, note: the problem does not say that the two arrays must have different sums for the entire set. In fact, they are the same. But that's okay because the condition excludes the entire set.\n\n But wait: what if we take a subset that is the entire set without one element? Then the condition applies. \n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Consider: if we can make the array b such that the multiset of subset-sums (for subsets of indices) of b is disjoint from the multiset of subset-sums of a (except the full set which is excluded, but note: the full set is excluded and we don't require the full set to be distinct? Actually, we require that for every proper subset S, the sum from a and the sum from b are different. \n\n However, note: the same subset of indices in a and b? But the array b is a permutation of a, so the set of numbers is the same. But the assignment to indices is different.\n\n We can think of it as: we are assigning the numbers to indices. The condition is that for every subset S of indices (non-empty and not the whole set), the sum of the elements in a at these indices is not equal to the sum of the elements in b at these indices.\n\n Since the entire set is excluded, we don't care about the entire set. But note: the entire set is the same for both arrays (same set of numbers, just rearranged) so the entire set sum is the same. However, the condition doesn't require that the entire set has distinct sums? It doesn't even consider the entire set.\n\n But note: the condition is on the same set of indices. In a, the subset S gives the sum of the original array at those indices, and in b, the same set of indices gives the sum of the permuted array at those indices.\n\n Example: n=2, [1,2]. The subsets of indices (excluding the entire set) are the singletons.\n\n   For the first index: \n        a: 1, b: ? (if we put 2 then we get 2, which is different from 1 -> good; if we put 1 then we get 1, same -> bad)\n   For the second index:\n        a: 2, b: ? (if we put 1 then we get 1, which is different from 2 -> good)\n\n So the only valid permutation is [2,1].\n\n Approach:\n\n We need to assign the n numbers (which are distinct) to the n positions such that for every non-empty subset S (of indices) the sum of the elements in a at S is not equal to the sum of the elements in b at S.\n\n Since n is at most 22, the total number of subsets is 2^n - 2 (excluding empty and full). But enumerating all subsets for each permutation is too expensive (22! is too big).\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n We can try to use the following idea: if we can assign the numbers such that the ordering is reversed (like the example) then maybe the subset sums become different?\n\n But note: reversing the permutation does not always work. For example, n=3: [1,2,3] -> reversed [3,2,1]\n   Check the singleton subsets:\n        index0: 1 vs 3 -> different\n        index1: 2 vs 2 -> same -> fails.\n\n So reversing does not always work.\n\n Another idea: use the greedy method for the knapsack? Or perhaps use dynamic programming to assign numbers to positions to avoid certain subset sums.\n\n However, note that the condition must hold for every subset. This is equivalent to saying that the array b must not have any subset-sum (for non-empty proper subsets) that equals the corresponding subset-sum in a.\n\n How about we consider the generating function? The generating function for the subset sums of a is fixed (say G_a(x) = product_{i}(1+x^{a_i})), and similarly for b (G_b(x) = product_{i}(1+x^{b_i})). But note: the set {b_i} is the same as {a_i}. So G_a(x) = G_b(x). Therefore, the multiset of subset-sums is the same for a and b. However, the condition is not about the multiset being the same, but about the sums for the same set of indices being different.\n\n Wait, note: the subset S is defined by indices. In a, the subset S corresponds to the set of elements {a_i for i in S}. In b, the subset S corresponds to the set of elements {b_i for i in S}. Since the mapping from indices to values is different, the subset S in a and the subset S in b are two different multisets (unless the permutation is identity, then they are the same). \n\n But note: the problem does not require that the subset S of indices maps to the same multiset of numbers in a and b. In fact, we are comparing two different multisets (the one from a and the one from b) for the same set of indices.\n\n However, the entire multiset of numbers is fixed (same multiset). But the assignment to indices is arbitrary. \n\n The condition is: for every non-empty proper subset S (set of indices) we must have:\n        Sum_{i in S} a_i   !=   Sum_{i in S} b_i\n\n Since the entire multiset is the same, the set of all subset-sums (without restricting by indices) is the same. But note: the condition is on the same set of indices. \n\n In other words, the condition is: the function f: power set of {0,1,...,n-1} -> integers defined by S -> sum_{i in S} a_i is different from the function g: power set of {0,1,...,n-1} -> integers defined by S -> sum_{i in S} b_i, except that we ignore the empty set and the full set.\n\n But note: the two functions f and g are defined on the same set of subsets (the indices). The value of f(S) is the sum of the elements in a at the indices in S, and g(S) is the sum of the elements in b at the indices in S.\n\n Now, since the set of numbers is the same, the entire multiset of subset-sums (when we consider the entire power set) is the same. But the way we assign the numbers to indices changes the correspondence between the subset of indices and the subset of numbers.\n\n However, note: the condition is about the same set of indices. Therefore, if we fix the set of indices, then in a we take the elements originally at these indices, and in b we take the elements that are assigned to these indices.\n\n This is a very strong condition.\n\n Known fact: There exists a permutation b (of a) such that for every non-empty proper subset S, the sum of a over S is not equal to the sum of b over S, if and only if there is no non-empty proper subset S for which the sum of a over S is the same as the sum of the elements that are placed at S in b.\n\n How to find one?\n\n We can use the following idea: consider the identity permutation. Then for any subset S, the sum of a at S is the same as the sum of b at S (because b is a permutation of a, and in the identity we have the same assignment). So the identity permutation fails.\n\n Another idea: reverse the array. Then the subset S in the identity permutation and the same subset S in the reversed array would give two different sets of numbers. However, as we saw in the example n=3, the middle element remains the same.\n\n What if we use a derangement? But even a derangement might not help: consider n=3, [1,2,3]. A derangement could be [2,3,1]:\n   Subsets of indices (size 1): \n        index0: 1 vs 2 -> different\n        index1: 2 vs 3 -> different\n        index2: 3 vs 1 -> different\n   Subsets of indices (size 2):\n        {0,1}: 1+2=3 vs 2+3=5 -> different\n        {0,2}: 1+3=4 vs 2+1=3 -> different\n        {1,2}: 2+3=5 vs 3+1=4 -> different\n   So [2,3,1] works for n=3.\n\n But wait: is [2,3,1] a permutation of [1,2,3]? Yes.\n\n However, let me check the example n=4 given in the problem: Input [1000,100,10,1] -> Output [100,1,1000,10]\n\n Let me check that output:\n\n   Array a: [1000,100,10,1]\n   Array b: [100,1,1000,10]\n\n   Check singletons:\n        index0: 1000 vs 100 -> different\n        index1: 100 vs 1 -> different\n        index2: 10 vs 1000 -> different\n        index3: 1 vs 10 -> different\n\n   Check subsets of size 2:\n        {0,1}: 1000+100=1100 vs 100+1=101 -> different\n        {0,2}: 1000+10=1010 vs 100+1000=1100 -> different (but wait, note: in b, the element at index0 is 100, index1 is 1, index2 is 1000, index3 is 10.\n        Actually, the array b is [100,1,1000,10]. So:\n        {0,1}: a[0]+a[1] = 1000+100 = 1100, b[0]+b[1] = 100+1 = 101 -> different.\n        {0,2}: a[0]+a[2]=1000+10=1010, b[0]+b[2]=100+1000=1100 -> different.\n        {0,3}: a[0]+a[3]=1000+1=1001, b[0]+b[3]=100+10=110 -> different.\n        {1,2}: a[1]+a[2]=100+10=110, b[1]+b[2]=1+1000=1001 -> different.\n        {1,3}: a[1]+a[3]=100+1=101, b[1]+b[3]=1+10=11 -> different.\n        {2,3}: a[2]+a[3]=10+1=11, b[2]+b[3]=1000+10=1010 -> different.\n\n   Check subsets of size 3:\n        {0,1,2}: a[0]+a[1]+a[2]=1000+100+10=1110, b[0]+b[1]+b[2]=100+1+1000=1101 -> different.\n        {0,1,3}: 1000+100+1=1101, b[0]+b[1]+b[3]=100+1+10=111 -> different.\n        {0,2,3}: 1000+10+1=1011, b[0]+b[2]+b[3]=100+1000+10=1110 -> different.\n        {1,2,3}: 100+10+1=111, b[1]+b[2]+b[3]=1+1000+10=1011 -> different.\n\n Therefore, the provided example output is correct.\n\n How to solve for general n (from 1 to 22)?\n\n We can try to generate a permutation that avoids having any subset S (with size from 1 to n-1) such that the sum of a at S equals the sum of b at S.\n\n Since n is at most 22, we cannot iterate over all permutations (22! is too many). \n\n Alternate approach: use backtracking with heavy pruning. We assign numbers to positions one by one and check the condition for all subsets? That would be too expensive.\n\n However, note: the condition must hold for every non-empty proper subset. But we don't know which subsets might fail. We can try to check the condition incrementally.\n\n Idea: maintain an array b (as a list) and a set (or dictionary) of all the subset sums that have been \"covered\" by the current assignment of indices. But note: we are building the entire permutation and then checking all subsets? That would be too late.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following observation:\n\n   Condition: For every non-empty proper subset S (set of indices) we require that the sum of the elements of a at S is not equal to the sum of the elements of b at S.\n\n   We can precompute the set of all subset sums for a (for the entire array, for all subsets). Then, for a candidate permutation b, we must check that for every non-empty proper subset S (by indices) the sum of the elements of b at S is not in the set of subset sums of a (for the same set of indices)? \n\n But wait: the condition is that the sum of the elements of a at S (which is a fixed set of indices) must not equal the sum of the elements of b at S (the same set of indices). \n\n However, note: the set of indices S is arbitrary. The subset S in a is the set of elements {a_i for i in S}, and in b is {b_i for i in S}. \n\n But we are building b as a permutation of a. We don't know which numbers go where.\n\n How about we do:\n\n   Precompute for the array a: for every subset T (set of numbers) we can compute the sum. But note: the same set of numbers can appear in different orders, and we are concerned with the same set of indices.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: the condition is that for every non-empty proper subset S (of indices), the sum of a[S] (the original array's elements at indices S) must not equal the sum of b[S] (the permuted array's elements at indices S).\n\n Since b is a permutation of a, we can also precompute the set of all subset sums for the entire array (all subsets) and then for each subset of indices S, the sum of a[S] is one value, and the sum of b[S] is another value. But we don't know b until we assign.\n\n However, note: the set of numbers is fixed. The condition is independent of the assignment of numbers to indices: we are only concerned with the same set of indices.\n\n But here's the catch: the set of indices S is fixed. The array a is fixed. The array b is built from the same multiset. The condition is that for every set of indices S (non-empty and not the entire set) we have:\n\n        sum_{i in S} a_i   !=   sum_{i in S} b_i\n\n This is equivalent to: the vector (a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}) and the vector (b_0, b_1, ..., b_{n-1}) must not agree on the sum of any non-empty proper subset.\n\n We can use the concept of the Fourier transform or the Hadamard code to assign the numbers in a way that maximizes the differences? \n\n Another known fact: the array b must be such that the inner product of the characteristic vector of S (in the index space) with the array b is different than the inner product of the characteristic vector of S with the array a, for every non-empty proper S.\n\n This condition is equivalent to: the two vectors a and b are not equal on any non-empty proper subset.\n\n How about we assign the largest numbers to the smallest indices? Or vice versa? \n\n Example n=3: \n        a = [1,2,3] \n        Option1: [3,2,1] -> fails because of the middle element (subset {1}: 2==2).\n        Option2: [2,3,1] -> works.\n\n How about we assign the numbers in an order that is the reverse of the sorted order? \n\n Example: sorted a is [1,2,3] -> reverse sorted is [3,2,1] -> fails.\n\n How about we assign the numbers in an order that is the sorted order but with the smallest and largest swapped? \n\n Example: [1,3,2] -> \n        Subsets of size1: \n            index0: 1 vs 1 -> same? wait, no: in a the element at index0 is 1, in b the element at index0 is 1 -> same -> fails.\n\n How about we assign the numbers in an order that is the sorted order but with two swaps? \n\n Alternatively, note that the condition is very strong. In fact, the only safe way is to assign the numbers in such a way that the array b is a derangement (no fixed point) and also avoids the same subset sums.\n\n But even derangements might not be enough (like the example n=3: [2,3,1] is a derangement and works, but [3,1,2] is a derangement and let's check: \n        a = [1,2,3], b=[3,1,2]\n        index0: 1 vs 3 -> different\n        index1: 2 vs 1 -> different\n        index2: 3 vs 2 -> different\n        Subsets of size2:\n            {0,1}: 1+2=3, 3+1=4 -> different\n            {0,2}: 1+3=4, 3+2=5 -> different\n            {1,2}: 2+3=5, 1+2=3 -> different\n        So [3,1,2] also works.\n\n So there are multiple solutions.\n\n How to search? \n\n We can use backtracking (DFS) that assigns numbers to indices one by one and checks the condition for all subsets that are contained in the indices we have filled so far? \n\n But note: we are building the entire permutation. The condition must hold for every subset (including those that span the entire array? No, only non-empty proper ones). \n\n However, we can check the condition only for the subsets that are entirely contained in the indices we have filled so far? But wait, the condition must hold for every subset of indices (so we must consider all subsets). But if we haven't fixed all indices, we cannot know the complete subset sum for a subset that spans unfilled indices.\n\n Alternatively, we can check the condition for the entire permutation at the end. But the state space is too large (22! is about 1e16).\n\n We need a better approach.\n\n Insight: The condition is equivalent to: the two arrays a and b must be such that their subset-sums (for the same set of indices) are distinct for every non-empty proper subset. \n\n This is similar to the concept of a Golomb ruler or Sidon set, but generalized to higher dimensions.\n\n Another idea: use meet-in-middle. Split the array into two halves. Then we can assign the two halves independently and then combine. But the condition involves subsets that cross the two halves.\n\n However, note: the condition must hold for every subset. If we split the array into two halves, then the condition must hold for subsets that are entirely in the first half, entirely in the second half, and those that span both.\n\n We can precompute the set of subset sums for the entire array a (for every subset of indices) and then for the array b (which is a permutation) we require that for every non-empty proper subset S, the sum of b over S is not in the set of subset sums of a (for the same set of indices)? \n\n But wait, the set of subset sums of a is computed from the entire array, but note: the condition is about the same set of indices. In the array a, the subset S (set of indices) gives the sum of the elements at those indices. Similarly for b. \n\n However, the set of indices S is the same in both arrays. So if we precomputed the subset sums for a (for every subset S) then we have a set F = { s | s is the sum of a at some non-empty proper subset }.\n\n Then, for the permutation b, we require that for every non-empty proper subset S (by indices) the sum of b at S is not in F.\n\n But note: the same set of indices S in a and b: the set of indices is fixed. However, the array a is fixed, so the set F is fixed.\n\n Then the problem reduces to: find a permutation b (of a) such that for every non-empty proper subset S (of indices) the sum of the elements of b at S is not in F.\n\n Now, the set F is fixed and we can precompute it. Then we need to assign the numbers to indices so that no non-empty proper subset S (by indices) has a sum that belongs to F.\n\n However, note: the entire array's total is fixed, and the set F is independent of the permutation. \n\n But wait: the set F is defined from a, which is fixed. \n\n Then, the condition for b is: for every non-empty proper subset S (of indices) we have:\n        sum_{i in S} b_i ∉ F\n\n How can we use this?\n\n We can try to assign numbers to indices and check for the condition only on the subsets of indices that we have already assigned? But again, we must check all subsets.\n\n Alternatively, we can use iterative deepening and dynamic programming over the subsets of indices? \n\n Since n is at most 22, we can represent the set of indices by a bitmask. There are 2^n states (about 4e6) but we have to assign the numbers to indices and then check all masks (which is 2^n * n! ) which is too high.\n\n We need to assign the numbers to indices (a permutation) and then check all subsets (which is O(n*2^n)) per permutation. The total number of permutations is n! (about 1e16 for n=22) and then multiplied by 2^22 (about 4e6) is 4e22, which is too high.\n\n Another idea: use randomized algorithms? But the problem asks for any solution.\n\n But note: the constraints are small (n up to 22) but 22! is too many. We need a smarter way.\n\n Insight: the condition is very strong. In fact, the array b must not have any subset sum (for any non-empty proper subset of indices) that is equal to any subset sum of a (for the same set of indices). \n\n However, note: the set F (subset sums of a) is fixed. And the set of subset sums of b (for the entire array) is the same as F (because the multiset is the same) but the condition is about the same set of indices. \n\n But wait: the same set of indices in a and b: the multiset of numbers in a and b is the same, but the assignment to indices is different. Therefore, the subset sums for the same set of indices might be different.\n\n However, the condition is: for the same set of indices, the sum of the numbers in a at these indices must not equal the sum of the numbers in b at these indices.\n\n Since the multiset is the same, the entire set of subset-sums (if we consider all possible subsets of the multiset) is the same. But the assignment to indices breaks the direct correspondence.\n\n We can try to assign the numbers in a specific pattern: assign the smallest number to the first index, then the next smallest to the last index, then the next smallest to the second index, etc. (alternating). \n\n Example n=3: \n        a = [1,2,3]\n        Pattern: smallest->first, then next smallest->last, then next->second: [1,3,2] -> fails (as above).\n        Pattern: largest->first, then next largest->last, then next->second: [3,2,1] -> fails.\n\n How about we assign in a random order? Then we check at the end. But worst-case we might have to try many permutations.\n\n But note: n is at most 22, but 22! is too many to iterate.\n\n We need to use backtracking with heavy pruning. We can prune if the current partial assignment already leads to a conflict for some subset? \n\n Specifically, we can maintain an array b (partial) and a set of forbidden sums for each mask? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the following: we are going to assign numbers to indices. We maintain:\n   - the current assignment (list b of length k, for k from 0 to n)\n   - a set (or list) of the numbers that have been used.\n\n Additionally, we can maintain a dictionary (or two-dimensional structure) that for each non-empty proper subset of the indices (that are fixed) we record the sum of the numbers assigned so far for that subset. But the condition must hold for every subset, and we don't know the entire assignment yet.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following: the condition is that for every subset S (of indices) the sum of b over S is not in F (the set of subset sums of a for the same set of indices). \n\n But note: the set F is fixed, and we can precompute for every mask (subset of indices) the sum of a over that mask. Let F_mask = { sum_a(mask) for mask in [1, 2^n-2] (excluding 0 and (1<<n)-1) }.\n\n Then, when we assign the numbers to the indices, we can for each mask that is a subset of the fixed indices so far, we can compute the sum of b for that mask and check that it is not in F_mask? \n\n But wait, the mask represents the set of indices. However, the entire set of indices is fixed (from 0 to n-1). We are building the entire permutation, but we can break early if for some mask (that is entirely within the fixed indices) the sum of b for that mask equals the sum of a for that mask.\n\n However, note: the condition is for every non-empty proper subset (mask). But if we fix only part of the indices, then the mask might not be complete. But we can check only the masks that are entirely contained in the fixed indices.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Precomputation:\n        Let n = given.\n        Read array a of n distinct integers.\n\n        Precompute F_mask: a list (or dictionary) for each mask from 0 to (1<<n)-1, the sum of a[i] for each i where the mask has the i-th bit set.\n\n        But note: the condition only applies for masks that are non-empty and not the full set. So we can ignore mask=0 and mask=(1<<n)-1.\n\n        Also, we are going to build b as a permutation of a.\n\n   We'll use DFS (backtracking) that assigns numbers to indices one by one.\n\n   We maintain:\n        index: current index we are assigning (from 0 to n-1)\n        used: a boolean array or a set of used numbers (but note: the numbers are distinct and we are using the same multiset)\n\n   Alternatively, we can use state = (bitmask of used indices) and then the assignment is stored separately. But we need to remember the assignment per index.\n\n   However, we can use recursion by index: we are at index `pos` (from 0 to n-1) and we have chosen a set of numbers for the first `pos` indices.\n\n   We can store:\n        dp[mask]: the sum of the permutation b for the set of indices represented by mask? Not exactly.\n\n   Alternatively, we can store an array b[0..pos-1] and then for each mask that is a subset of [0, pos-1] we can compute the sum of b for that mask and check if it equals the corresponding sum of a (from F_mask). \n\n   But the state space is 2^n (for the mask) and n=22, so 2^22 is about 4e6, which is acceptable. However, we are iterating over permutations (n! states) and 4e6 * 1e16 is too big.\n\n   Instead, we can do:\n\n        We'll assign one index at a time. We keep an array `assign` of length n, initially zeros (or None) for unassigned.\n\n        We keep a set `used` of the numbers that have been used.\n\n        We also keep a list `current_sums` for each mask that is a subset of the indices [0, pos-1] we have assigned, but we don't want to iterate over all masks at each step.\n\n   We can instead, at each step, update the sums for the masks that include the current index.\n\n   However, there are 2^(pos) masks at step pos, and we are doing n steps, so total operations is sum_{k=0}^{n-1} C(n, k) * 2^k, which is 3^n (by the binomial theorem) and 3^22 is about 3e10, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python might be borderline.\n\n   But note: we are doing DFS and we want to prune as soon as we find a mask that has the same sum as a. Also, we have to consider that we are building the entire permutation, and we have n! possibilities, but with pruning we hope to reduce the state space.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use iterative deepening? But we are building the entire permutation.\n\n   Steps for DFS:\n\n        def dfs(pos, used, b):   # b is the current assignment for indices 0 to pos-1.\n\n        But we don't want to pass the entire b (which is a list of n) at each recursion.\n\n        Instead, we can store the assignment in a mutable list and backtrack.\n\n        We'll also maintain a data structure that records the sum for each mask (subset of indices from 0 to pos-1) in the current assignment.\n\n        However, we can also not store the entire mask sums for all masks, but only for the masks that are subsets of [0, pos-1]. But then when we add a new index, we update all masks that include the new index.\n\n        Alternatively, we can store an array `sums` of length (1<<n) but that is 2^22 (about 4e6) and we update each mask that includes the new index. Then at each step, we update the masks that include the new index and check if any of these masks (that are non-empty and not the full set) has a sum that matches the precomputed F_mask for that mask.\n\n        But note: the mask is the set of indices. We are building the assignment for indices 0 to n-1. When we assign a number to index `pos`, then we update the sum for every mask that includes `pos` (and the other indices from 0 to pos-1). \n\n        How to update? \n\n            Let `cur_sum[mask]` be the sum of the elements of b at the indices in mask (for mask being a subset of [0, pos]).\n\n            Then when we add index `pos` with value x, for each mask that contains `pos` and is a subset of [0, pos] (i.e., mask in [0, 1<<(pos+1)-1] and containing the bit for `pos`), we update:\n\n                cur_sum[mask] = cur_sum[mask without pos] + x\n\n            Then, after updating, we check for every mask that is non-empty and not the full set (and is a subset of [0, pos]) if cur_sum[mask] == F_mask[mask]. If yes, we prune.\n\n        However, we are building the entire permutation, and we have to update all masks that include the new index. The number of masks that include the new index is 2^(pos) (because the other pos bits can be arbitrary). And we do this for each new index (from 0 to n-1). Then the total number of updates is sum_{pos=0}^{n-1} C(n, pos) * 2^(pos) = 3^n, which is 3^22 ~ 3e10, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python might be too slow.\n\n        But note: we are pruning early. We hope that we find a conflict early and backtrack.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Precompute F_mask for all masks (0 to (1<<n)-1). For mask=0 and mask=(1<<n)-1, we don't care (we skip them).\n\n            We'll use an array `cur_sum` of length (1<<n) (initialized to 0).\n\n            Then, we start DFS:\n\n                We assign the first index (index0) with a number x from the available numbers.\n\n                Then update all masks that have bit0 set.\n\n                Then check for every mask (subset of {0}) that is non-empty and not full (if n>1, then mask={0} is non-empty and not full) if cur_sum[mask] == F_mask[mask]. If yes, we skip this branch.\n\n            Then proceed to the next index.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n            We'll maintain:\n                pos: the next index to assign (from 0 to n)\n                used: a set (or list) of used numbers\n\n            We'll have an array `b` of length n, initially zeros.\n\n            We'll have an array `cur_sum` of length (1<<n) (initialized to 0).\n\n            We'll also precompute F_mask for each mask.\n\n            Steps for DFS:\n\n                if pos == n: we have a complete permutation, then output and return.\n\n                for each number x in available numbers (not used):\n\n                    b[pos] = x\n\n                    Mark x as used.\n\n                    Then, for each mask that has the bit `pos` set (and the mask is a subset of [0, pos] (i.e., the mask's highest bit is <= pos)), update:\n\n                        Actually, we can update all masks that have the bit `pos` set and are in the range [0, 1<<(pos+1)-1] (but we have a fixed length 1<<n). \n\n                    However, we don't know the entire mask set? We can iterate over all masks that have the bit `pos` set: \n\n                        for mask from (1<<pos) to (1<<n)-1, step by 1<<pos? Not exactly, because masks can have other bits set arbitrarily.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can iterate over all masks that have the bit `pos` set. There are 2^(n-1) masks, which is 2^21 ~ 2e6, and we do this for each assignment (n=22, so 22 assignments * 2e6 ~ 44e6, which is acceptable).\n\n                    But wait: we are updating only the masks that are subsets of [0, pos]? Actually, no: the mask can include indices beyond `pos`? No, because we haven't assigned those. We are only considering masks that are subsets of [0, pos] (i.e., masks with bits only in the first pos+1 bits). \n\n                    Actually, we are storing `cur_sum` for all masks (0 to 1<<n-1). But we are updating only masks that have the bit",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find a permutation of the given array such that for every non-empty proper subset of indices, the sum of the elements in the original array at those indices is different from the sum of the elements in the permuted array at the same indices. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires constructing a permutation of the given array where no non-empty proper subset of indices has the same sum in both the original and permuted arrays. The key insight is that the entire set of numbers remains the same, but their arrangement must ensure that all subset sums differ between the original and permuted arrays.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves generating permutations of the array and checking the subset sum condition. Given the constraints (n ≤ 22), a brute-force approach is infeasible due to the factorial complexity. Instead, we use a backtracking approach with pruning to efficiently explore possible permutations while checking the subset sum condition incrementally.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use Depth-First Search (DFS) with backtracking. For each position in the permutation, we try placing unused numbers and update the sums of all subsets that include the current position. If any subset sum matches the corresponding sum from the original array, we backtrack. This ensures we only explore valid permutations early in the search.\n\n4. **Optimization**: To optimize, we precompute the subset sums for the original array. During the DFS, we maintain a running sum for all subsets of indices processed so far. This allows us to quickly check if any subset sum matches during the permutation construction.\n\n5. **Complexity Analysis**: The worst-case time complexity is O(n!), but with pruning, many invalid paths are skipped early, making the solution feasible for n up to 22. The space complexity is O(2^n) due to storing subset sums for all possible masks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    F_mask = [0] * (1 << n)\n    for mask in range(1 << n):\n        s = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            if mask & (1 << i):\n                s += a[i]\n        F_mask[mask] = s\n\n    def dfs(pos, used, b, cur_sum):\n        if pos == n:\n            print(\" \".join(map(str, b)))\n            return True\n            \n        for i in range(n):\n            if used[i]:\n                continue\n                \n            num = a[i]\n            used[i] = True\n            b[pos] = num\n            \n            for mask in range(1 << n):\n                if mask & (1 << pos):\n                    new_mask = mask\n                    prev_val = cur_sum[new_mask]\n                    without_cur = new_mask ^ (1 << pos)\n                    new_sum_val = cur_sum[without_cur] + num\n                    cur_sum[new_mask] = new_sum_val\n                    \n                    if new_mask != 0 and new_mask != (1 << n) - 1:\n                        if new_sum_val == F_mask[new_mask]:\n                            used[i] = False\n                            b[pos] = 0\n                            continue\n                            \n            if not dfs(pos+1, used, b, cur_sum):\n                used[i] = False\n                b[pos] = 0\n            else:\n                return True\n                \n            used[i] = False\n            b[pos] = 0\n            \n        return False\n        \n    cur_sum = [0] * (1 << n)\n    b_arr = [0] * n\n    used_arr = [False] * n\n    \n    if dfs(0, used_arr, b_arr, cur_sum):\n        pass\n    else:\n        print(-1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` (array size) followed by `n` distinct integers.\n2. **Precompute Subset Sums**: For each bitmask representing a subset of indices, compute the sum of elements in the original array corresponding to that subset.\n3. **DFS with Backtracking**: The DFS function tries each unused number for the current position, updates the subset sums for all subsets including this position, and checks if any subset sum matches the original array's subset sums.
