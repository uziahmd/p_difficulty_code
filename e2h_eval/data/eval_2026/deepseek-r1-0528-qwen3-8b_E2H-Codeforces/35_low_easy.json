Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of array elements. The next line contains n space-separated integers a0, a1, ..., an - 1 (0 ≤ ai ≤ 104) — elements of array a.The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m. Number m equals .\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the maximum value of function f(x) for all .\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n3 8\\n10', '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010']\n\n### Output\n['3', '27']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case m = 20 = 1, f(0) = 0, f(1) = a0 = 3.In the second sample m = 20 + 21 + 23 = 11, the maximum value of function equals f(5) = a0 + a2 = 17 + 10 = 27.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

Actually wait: 11 in binary is 1011 (if we consider 4 bits, then positions 0 to 3).\n   But the example says: x=11 (which is 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^3) so they are using the least significant bit as the 0-th.\n\n However, note the input for m is given as a binary string of length n. The problem says: \n   \"the binary representation of number m\" is given as s0 s1 ... s_{n-1}\n\n And note: the formula for m: m = s0 * 2^0 + s1 * 2^1 + ... + s_{n-1} * 2^{n-1}?\n\n But wait: the problem says: \n   \"The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m.\"\n\n And then: \"Number m equals .\"\n\n Actually, in the example: \n   Input: '2\\n3 8\\n10' -> n=2, a=[3,8], m is given by binary string \"10\", which is 2 in decimal (since s0='1', s1='0').\n\n Then m = 1*2^0 + 0*2^1 = 1.\n\n So the i-th character in the string (from left to right) corresponds to the bit for 2^(n-1-i) or 2^i?\n\n Let me clarify:\n\n In the example with n=4 and x=11 (which is 1011) and the example function call uses:\n   f(11) = a0 + a1 + a3.\n\n But note: 11 in binary (with at least 4 bits) is 1011, meaning:\n   bit0 (LSB) is set -> index0 (a0)\n   bit1 is not set -> skip a1\n   bit2 is set -> but wait, the example says a3, so it's using the most significant bit as the highest index?\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\"\n\n And the example: n=4, so there are 4 bits. How are they ordered?\n\n Since m is represented by a string of n digits, and the formula for m is:\n   m = s0 * 2^0 + s1 * 2^1 + ... + s_{n-1} * 2^{n-1}? \n\n But wait, the example input \"10\" for n=2: \n   s0='1', s1='0'\n   Then m = 1*2^0 + 0*2^1 = 1, which matches.\n\n So the string s (the binary representation of m) is given in the order from least significant bit to most significant? \n Actually no: the standard way is that the first digit is the least significant? \n\n Let me check the example: \n   Example 1: n=2, m=10 (binary string \"10\") -> then m = 1*2^0 + 0*2^1 = 1.\n\n But wait, the example input is given as \"10\", and typically we write binary numbers from most significant to least significant.\n However, here the problem says: \n   \"the third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1\"\n\n and then defines m as the sum over i from 0 to n-1 of s_i * (2^i). \n\n So the string s is given in increasing powers of two: the first character is the coefficient for 2^0, the second for 2^1, etc.\n\n Therefore, the array a is indexed from 0 to n-1, and the i-th element a_i is used when the i-th bit (i.e., the bit for ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) for all integers \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements \\( a_i \\) for each bit set in the binary representation of \\( x \\). The challenge is to efficiently determine the optimal \\( x \\) without checking every possible value up to \\( m \\), especially since \\( m \\) can be very large.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The function \\( f(x) \\) sums elements from array \\( a \\) based on the bits set in \\( x \\)'s binary representation. The key observation is that higher indices in \\( a \\) (corresponding to higher bits in \\( x \\)) contribute more significantly to the sum if set. However, the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\) limits which bits can be set.\n2. **Binary Representation Handling**: The binary string provided represents \\( m \\) in little-endian order (least significant bit first). We process this string to know which bits are allowed to be set in \\( x \\).\n3. **Greedy Selection**: We prioritize setting bits in \\( x \\) starting from the most significant bit (highest index) down to the least significant bit. For each bit position, if setting it does not violate the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\), we include the corresponding \\( a_i \\) in the sum. If setting a bit might exceed \\( m \\), we skip it and proceed to lower bits, ensuring the solution remains within bounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    s = data[2].strip()\n    \n    total = 0\n    current = 0\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        bit_val = 1 << i\n        if s[i] == '1':\n            if current + a[i] <= m:\n                total += a[i]\n                current += a[i]\n            else:\n                pass\n        else:\n            pass\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three parts: the number of elements \\( n \\), the array \\( a \\), and the binary string representing \\( m \\).\n2. **Initialization**: We initialize `total` to accumulate the sum of selected elements and `current` to keep track of the current value of \\( x \\) being constructed.\n3. **Processing Bits**: We iterate from the most significant bit (highest index) to the least significant bit (lowest index). For each bit:\n   - If the corresponding bit in \\( m \\) is set ('1'), we check if adding the element \\( a_i \\) to `current` would keep \\( x \\) within bounds. If yes, we include \\( a_i \\) in the sum and update `current`.\n   - If the bit is not set ('0'), we skip it.\n4. **Output**: After processing all bits, `total` holds the maximum value of \\( f(x) \\) under the given constraints, which is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging the binary representation of \\( m \\) and a greedy selection strategy, ensuring optimal performance even for large \\( n \\).",
