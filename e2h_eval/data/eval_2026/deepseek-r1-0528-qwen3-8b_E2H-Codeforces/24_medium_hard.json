She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n We need to leave only the tabs from l to r. Initially, all tabs from 1 to n are open.\n\n There are two types of operations:\n  1. Move the cursor: either left (to max(current - 1, a)) or right (to min(current + 1, b)), where a and b are the minimum and maximum indices of unclosed tabs.\n     But note: initially, a=1, b=n. After closing some tabs, a and b change.\n\n However, note that we can also close tabs by:\n  2. Closing all tabs to the left of the cursor (so the new a becomes i, but note that the cursor is at i, and we close [a, i-1]).\n  3. Closing all tabs to the right of the cursor (so the new b becomes i).\n\n The goal is to minimize the number of seconds.\n\n Observation:\n Since we are only concerned with leaving tabs [l, r] and we start with [1, n], we must close:\n   - All tabs with index < l (if any) and all tabs with index > r (if any).\n\n We have two boundaries: left boundary (l) and right boundary (r). The cursor starts at `pos`.\n\n The operations can be broken down into two parts: closing the left part (tabs < l) and the right part (tabs > r). \n But note: sometimes we might do both in one go, but typically we have to move the cursor to the appropriate side.\n\n However, note that after closing some tabs, the available range changes.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We consider the following possibilities:\n\n Case 0: If the entire segment [1, n] is already the desired [l, r] then we don't need to do anything -> 0 seconds.\n\n But note: if the current set of tabs is [1, n] and we want [l, r] and if [l, r] is the entire set, then yes, 0.\n\n Actually, we note that the problem does not require us to close the tabs one by one. We can close all tabs to the left or right in one operation.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If l == 1 and r == n, then we don't need to close any tabs -> 0.\n\n 2. Otherwise, we must close the left part (if l > 1) and/or the right part (if r < n).\n\n However, note: we can close from both sides simultaneously? Actually, we can perform operations arbitrarily.\n\n Let's break the problem:\n\n We have two boundaries to cover: the left boundary (l) and the right boundary (r). \n\n We can consider:\n\n Option A: Close the left part first and then the right part.\n Option B: Close the right part first and then the left part.\n Option C: Move the cursor to the left boundary and then close the left part, then move to the right boundary and close the right part? But wait, after closing the left part, the available tabs become [l, n]. Then the cursor is at the left boundary (l) and we can then close the right part.\n\n However, note that we can also close without moving to the boundary? For example, if we are at the left boundary, we can close the right part. Similarly, if we are at the right boundary, we can close the left part.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the process as:\n\n - First, we might need to move the cursor to the left boundary (if we are going to close the left part) or to the right boundary (if we are going to close the right part).\n\n But note: we can also close without moving the cursor? Actually, we can close the left part only if there are tabs to the left (and similarly for the right). But if we are not at the left boundary, we can still close the left part from a position beyond the left boundary. However, closing the left part requires that the cursor is at a tab that is at least l (because the closure operation doesn't require being exactly at l, but the closure operation will remove everything from the current minimum (which is initially 1) to the cursor's left. However, we want to leave [l, r] so we must make sure that when we close the left part we don't close too much.\n\n Important: When we close the left part, we must ensure that we do not close below l. Similarly for the right.\n\n Therefore, the safe way is to close the left part from a tab that is >= l. But note: if we are at a tab greater than or equal to l, then we can close the left part (which will remove from the current minimum up to the cursor's left, but if our cursor is at a tab that is >= l, then the closure operation will remove from the current minimum (which is 1) to the cursor's left, but that would include everything from 1 to (cursor-1). However, we only want to remove from 1 to l-1. So we cannot use an arbitrary cursor position to close the left part without affecting the desired segment.\n\n Therefore, to close the left part, we must have the cursor at a tab that is exactly l (so that the closure operation removes from 1 to l-1, which is exactly the part we want to remove). Similarly, to close the right part, the cursor must be at r.\n\n But wait: what if we are at a tab to the right of l? Then if we close the left part, we remove from the current minimum (which is 1) to the cursor's left. That would remove everything from 1 to (cursor-1). But if the cursor is at a tab greater than l, then we remove from 1 to (cursor-1) which includes [l, ...] as well? We don't want to remove the desired segment.\n\n Therefore, we must close the left part only from the tab l, and the right part only from the tab r.\n\n However, note: we can also close the left part from a tab that is less than l? But then we would remove too much. So we must not do that.\n\n Therefore, the plan is:\n\n We must get the cursor to l (to close the left part) and/or to r (to close the right part). But note: we can also close one part without necessarily going to the opposite boundary.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If we need to close the left part (i.e., l > 1), then we must have the cursor at l (or at least at a tab >= l? but note: if we are at a tab > l, then closing the left part would remove too much). So we must have the cursor at l to close the left part without removing the desired segment.\n\n 2. Similarly, to close the right part (r < n), we must have the cursor at r.\n\n Now, how do we get the cursor to l and r?\n\n We can break the problem into:\n\n Option 1: First close the left part, then the right part.\n   Steps:\n     - Move the cursor from `pos` to `l` (this takes |pos - l| seconds, because we can move one step per second and we don't have obstacles until we close, but note: we haven't closed any tabs yet so the boundaries are 1 and n).\n     - Then close the left part (1 second).\n     - Then move the cursor from `l` to `r` (this takes |l - r| seconds).\n     - Then close the right part (1 second).\n\n   Total: |pos-l| + 1 + |l-r| + 1 = |pos-l| + |l-r| + 2\n\n Option 2: First close the right part, then the left part.\n   Steps:\n     - Move the cursor from `pos` to `r` (|pos - r| seconds).\n     - Close the right part (1 second).\n     - Move the cursor from `r` to `l` (|r - l| seconds).\n     - Close the left part (1 second).\n\n   Total: |pos-r| + 1 + |r-l| + 1 = |pos-r| + |r-l| + 2\n\n But note: |r-l| is the same as |l-r|.\n\n However, there is a third option: we might be able to close one part without moving the entire distance from `pos` to the boundary, by using the other closure operation in the middle.\n\n Example: In the second test case: \"6 3 1 3\"\n\n   Here, n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3.\n\n   We need to close the right part (from 4 to 6). We can do:\n\n     - Move the cursor from 3 to 3 (no move) and then close the right part (from 4 to 6). This takes 0 moves + 1 closure = 1 second.\n\n   Alternatively, if we try to close the left part (but we don't need to) then we don't do that.\n\n   Also, note: we can close the right part from any tab that is <= r? Actually, to close the right part we must be at r (so that we don't remove the desired part). But wait, the operation for closing the right part is defined as: close all tabs to the right of the cursor. So if we are at a tab < r, then the closure operation would remove from the cursor+1 to the current maximum (which is n) and that is acceptable because we want to remove everything from r+1 to n, but if we are at a tab < r, then the closure operation would remove from (cursor+1) to n, which is more than just from r+1 to n. However, note: we are allowed to close multiple tabs at once, but we must not leave any tab outside [l, r]. So if we are at a tab i (with i < r) and we close the right part, we remove from i+1 to n. But we want to leave from l to r. So if i < r, then the removal from i+1 to n will remove from i+1 to r (which is part of our desired segment) and that is not allowed.\n\n Therefore, we must be at r to close the right part, because then we remove from r+1 to n (which is exactly the part we want to remove).\n\n Similarly, we must be at l to close the left part.\n\n However, note: what if we are already at the boundary? Then we can close without moving.\n\n But wait: in the example \"6 3 1 3\", we are at 3 which is the right boundary (r=3). So we can close the right part without moving.\n\n Now, what about a mixed scenario? For example, if we need to close both sides, but we are in between.\n\n Example: \"5 3 1 4\" (n=5, pos=3, l=1, r=4)\n\n   We need to close the left part? Actually, no, because l=1, so we don't close the left. But wait, the problem says: close all tabs that don't belong to [l, r]. So we only need to close the right part (from 5 to 5). \n\n   However, let me correct: the desired segment is [1,4]. So we must close tab 5. \n\n   Steps:\n     - We are at 3. We can close the right part from 3? No, because then we remove from 4 to 5, which removes the desired tab 4. \n\n   So we must be at 4 to close the right part. Therefore, we must move from 3 to 4 (1 second), then close the right part (1 second). Total 2 seconds.\n\n   Alternatively, we could first close the left part? But we don't need to close the left part because l=1 (so nothing to the left of 1). So we only need to close the right part.\n\n   Therefore, we must move to 4 and then close.\n\n Another example: \"5 3 2 3\" (n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=3)\n\n   We need to close the left part (tab1) and the right part (tab4 and 5). \n\n   How?\n     - To close the left part, we must be at 2 (the left boundary). So we can move from 3 to 2 (1 second), then close the left part (1 second). Then we are at 2, and then we must move to 3 (1 second) and then close the right part (1 second). Total 4 seconds.\n\n   Alternatively, we can first close the right part from 3? But if we are at 3, closing the right part would remove from 4 to 5 (which is acceptable). Then we are at 3, and then we need to close the left part. But to close the left part we must be at 2. So we move from 3 to 2 (1 second) and close the left part (1 second). Same total: 1 (move to 3 is not needed because we are already at 3) + 1 (close right) + 1 (move from 3 to 2) + 1 (close left) = 4.\n\n   But wait, we started at 3. So the steps:\n\n      Start: cursor at 3, tabs [1,5]\n      Step 1: Close the right part (from 4 to 5) -> now tabs [1,3]. But wait, the closure operation when at 3: closes [4,5] (which is good). Then the new boundaries are [1,3]. Now, we can move the cursor from 3 to 2 (which is the new left boundary) because the new minimum is 1 and maximum is 3. Then close the left part (from 1 to 1). \n\n   So the sequence is: \n        Operation 1: Close right (at 3) -> 1 second.\n        Operation 2: Move left from 3 to 2 -> 1 second (because from 3, we can move to 2: since the current boundaries are [1,3] so 3-1=2 is allowed).\n        Operation 3: Close left (at 2) -> 1 second.\n\n   Total 3 seconds.\n\n   Why the difference? Because after closing the right part, the boundaries changed. The left part closure can now be done from 2 and it will remove only from 1 to 1 (which is correct). \n\n   Therefore, the above simple formula (|pos-l| + |l-r| + 2) or (|pos-r| + |r-l| + 2) does not hold.\n\n We must consider that we might not need to visit both boundaries. Also, the closure operations change the boundaries.\n\n However, note: the problem allows us to close from any position as long as we don't close the desired segment. But the closure operation for left requires that we are at the left boundary (l) and for right at the right boundary (r). \n\n But wait: after closing one side, the boundaries change. For example, if we close the right part, then the new boundaries become [min_index, r] (where min_index is the current minimum, which is unchanged until we close the left). Similarly, closing the left part sets the new boundaries to [l, max_index].\n\n Therefore, the minimal operations might be:\n\n  Option 1: If we need to close both sides, we can do:\n    a) Go to l, close left, then go to r, close right.\n    b) Go to r, close right, then go to l, close left.\n    c) Or, we can interleave? Actually, note: we cannot close the left part from a position greater than l because that would remove too much. Similarly for the right.\n\n  But wait: after closing one side, the other closure operation can be done from the boundary. However, the movement is constrained by the current boundaries.\n\n  However, note: the problem does not require the cursor to remain within the final segment during the process? Actually, the problem says: \"the mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab\" and then we can move (with the constraints of the current boundaries). \n\n  After closing the right part, the boundaries become [a, r] (with a being the original a until we close the left). Similarly, after closing the left part, the boundaries become [l, b].\n\n  But note: we are allowed to move arbitrarily within the current boundaries.\n\n  Therefore, the minimal steps might be:\n\n  Let d_left = abs(pos - l)   [steps to go from pos to l, but note: if we have already closed some tabs, the path might be shorter? Actually, we are allowed to move only within the current boundaries, but initially the boundaries are [1, n]. And we are going to close one side at a time.\n\n  However, we are free to choose the order.\n\n  We can consider:\n\n  Case 1: Only left part needs to be closed (l==1 is false, but actually l==1 means we don't close left, so condition: l>1 and r==n? Actually, we need to close left if l>1, and right if r<n.\n\n  Actually, the conditions are:\n      left_needed = (l > 1)\n      right_needed = (r < n)\n\n  Then:\n\n  If not left_needed and not right_needed: 0.\n\n  Else if left_needed and not right_needed:\n      Then we must close the left part. We must move to l and then close.\n      Steps: |pos - l| (to move to l) and then 1 second to close. But wait, what if we are already at l? Then 0 moves and 1 second.\n\n      However, note: we might not need to move if we are already at l? But if we are at l, then we can close the left part. But what if we are at a tab greater than l? Then we have to move to l.\n\n      But also, what if we are at a tab less than l? Then we cannot close the left part (because we are at a tab that is less than l, so we are in the desired segment? Actually, no: we are at a tab < l, but we want to keep from l to r. So we must close the left part from a tab >= l. But we are at a tab < l, so we cannot close the left part from here because then we would remove from a to (current-1) and that would remove the desired segment [l, ...] if we are at a tab < l? \n\n      Actually, let me clarify: the closure operation for the left part removes all tabs to the left of the cursor. If we are at a tab i (which is < l) then the closure operation would remove from the current minimum (initially 1) to i-1. But note: the desired segment is [l, r] and we are keeping [l, r]. If we remove from 1 to i-1 (with i-1 < l) then we remove part of the desired segment? \n\n      Therefore, we must not be at a tab < l when we close the left part. So if we are at a tab < l, we must move to l (or beyond) first? But wait, we are not allowed to remove the desired segment. \n\n      Actually, the problem states: \"she wants to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r\". So we must not remove any tab from l to r. \n\n      Therefore, to close the left part, we must be at a tab >= l. But if we are at a tab < l, then we cannot close the left part without removing the desired segment (because the closure operation would remove from 1 to (current-1) and if current-1 >= l, then we remove from 1 to (current-1) which includes l to (current-1) which is part of the desired segment). \n\n      Hence, we must first move to l (if we are not already at l) and then close the left part.\n\n      Similarly, for the right part: we must be at r (>= l) and if we are at a tab > r, we cannot close the right part (because then we would remove from (current+1) to n, which includes r+1 to current-1, but we want to leave [l, r]). Actually, if we are at a tab > r, then the closure operation would remove from (current+1) to n, which is acceptable because we want to remove from r+1 to n. But wait: if we are at a tab i (with i>r) then the closure operation removes from i+1 to n. However, we want to remove from r+1 to n. So we must remove everything from r+1 to n, regardless of our current position. But note: if we are at i (i>r) then the closure operation removes from i+1 to n, which is a subset of [r+1, n] (if i>r, then i+1>r+1). So we are not removing the entire [r+1, n]? \n\n      Actually, the problem says: \"close all the tabs to the right of the cursor\". So we remove [cursor+1, b]. We want to remove [r+1, n]. So if we are at a tab i (i>r) then we remove [i+1, n] which is a subset of [r+1, n] (because i+1>r+1). Then we haven't removed [r+1, i]! \n\n      Therefore, we must be at r to close the right part so that we remove exactly [r+1, n].\n\n      Similarly, for the left part: we must be at l to remove [a, l-1] (which is [1, l-1] if a is 1, but if we have already closed the right part then a remains 1).\n\n      So the conclusion is: to close the left part, we must be at l. To close the right part, we must be at r.\n\n  Then, the minimal steps are:\n\n  If we need to close both sides:\n\n      Option 1: \n          Move from `pos` to `l` (if `pos` is not already at `l`). Then close the left part (1 sec). Then move from `l` to `r` (if `l` != `r`). Then close the right part (1 sec).\n\n      Option 2:\n          Move from `pos` to `r` (if `pos` is not already at `r`). Then close the right part (1 sec). Then move from `r` to `l` (if `r` != `l`). Then close the left part (1 sec).\n\n      But note: we might be able to avoid moving the entire distance by doing one closure first and then the other without backtracking the full distance? \n\n      However, the above two options are independent.\n\n      But wait: what if we are already at one of the boundaries? Then we don't need to move for that boundary.\n\n      Actually, we can combine:\n\n      Option 3: \n          If we are between l and r, then we can choose to close one side without having to go to the opposite boundary if we are already at one boundary? \n\n      However, note: we must be at the boundary to close. \n\n      But consider: we might close one side without moving to the opposite boundary, but we have to be at the boundary for that side.\n\n      However, note: the two closures require being at two different positions (unless l==r). \n\n      Therefore, the total operations for both closures is:\n\n          Option 1: (if we go l then r)\n              steps = (abs(pos - l)) + 1 + (abs(l - r)) + 1\n\n          Option 2: (if we go r then l)\n              steps = (abs(pos - r)) + 1 + (abs(r - l)) + 1\n\n      However, we can also consider:\n\n          Option 3: Maybe we can close one side from a position that is not the boundary if we don't mind the closure operation not removing the entire unwanted part? But we cannot, because we must remove exactly the unwanted part.\n\n      But wait: what if we are already at one boundary? Then we don't need to move for that boundary. For example, if we are at l, then we can close the left part (without moving) and then move to r (if necessary) and close the right part.\n\n      Similarly, if we are at r, we can close the right part without moving, then move to l and close the left part.\n\n      However, what if we are already at l and r? Then l==r, and we only need to close one side? Actually, if l==r, then we must close both sides if they exist (i.e., if l>1 and r<n). But if l==r and l>1 and r<n, then we must close both sides. But then we are at l (which is also r). Then we can close the left part and then the right part? \n\n      But note: after closing the left part, the boundaries change: the new boundaries are [l, n] (if we started with [1, n] and we closed the left part from l). Then we are at l (which is now the left boundary) and we can then close the right part from l? But we are at l, and we want to close the right part, we must move to r (which is l) again? Then we don't move, and then close the right part. \n\n      Actually, if l==r, then the closure of the left part and the right part are independent? But wait, the left part closure removes from 1 to l-1, and the right part closure removes from l+1 to n. But if l==r, then we want to leave only [l, l]. So we must remove everything except l. \n\n      However, if we are at l, then we can close the left part (removing 1 to l-1) and then close the right part (removing l+1 to n). This is valid.\n\n      But the movement: we don't move, so steps = 0 (if we are at l) + 1 (close left) + 0 (still at l) + 1 (close right) = 2.\n\n      But if we are not at l, then we must move to l (which is the same as r) and then do the two closures.\n\n      However, note: if l==r, then the two closures are independent and we must be at l to do both? Actually, we must be at l for the left closure and at r (which is l) for the right closure. So we are at l for both.\n\n      Therefore, the minimal steps for two closures (both needed) is the minimum of:\n\n          Option 1: |pos - l| + 2 (if we do left then right) [because we move to l (|pos-l|), close left (1), then we are at l, then we don't need to move because l==r? Actually, if l==r, then after closing left, the boundaries change, but we are at l (which is now the left boundary) and we are also at r (because r=l). So we can close the right part without moving. So total |pos-l| + 2.\n\n          Option 2: |pos - r| + 2, but since l==r, then |pos-l| = |pos-r|.\n\n      So same.\n\n  But wait, what if we don't need to close both sides? \n\n  We have three cases:\n\n      Case 1: Only left part needs to be closed (l>1 and r==n) -> then steps = |pos-l| + 1, but wait, what if we are already at l? Then we don't need to move, just 1.\n\n      Case 2: Only right part needs to be closed (l==1 and r<n) -> then steps = |pos-r| + 1, unless we are already at r.\n\n      Case 3: Both parts need to be closed.\n\n  However, note: we must be at l to close the left part, and at r to close the right part. \n\n  But there is another possibility: sometimes we might not need to move the entire way if we are already at one of the boundaries.\n\n  Therefore, we can write:\n\n      if l == 1 and r == n:\n          ans = 0\n\n      else:\n          left_needed = (l > 1)\n          right_needed = (r < n)\n\n          if not left_needed and not right_needed:\n              ans = 0\n          elif left_needed and not right_needed:\n              # Only close left part\n              # We must be at l to close the left part.\n              moves = abs(pos - l)\n              ans = moves + 1\n          elif not left_needed and right_needed:\n              moves = abs(pos - r)\n              ans = moves + 1\n          else: # both needed\n              # We have two orders: go to l first then r, or go to r first then l.\n              # But note: we might be already at one of the boundaries, so we don't have to move the entire distance.\n\n              # Option 1: go to l then to r\n              option1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2\n\n              # Option 2: go to r then to l\n              option2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2\n\n              # But wait: if we are already at l, then we don't need to go to l, but then we still have to go to r (unless we are at r already). Similarly for starting at r.\n\n              # However, note: if we are already at l, then the first part (going to l) is 0, but then we have to go from l to r (if l != r) and then close (so +2). Similarly, if we are already at r, then the second part (going to r) is 0, but then we have to go from r to l (if l != r) and then close (so +2).\n\n              # But also, if we are at l and r (i.e., l==r), then the movement from l to r is 0, so option1 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, and option2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2.\n\n              # However, is there a possibility that we can close one part without moving the entire distance and then the other part without moving the entire distance? \n\n              # Consider: if we are at a position between l and r, then we can choose to close one part (by moving to that part's boundary) and then move to the other boundary.\n\n              # But note: we cannot avoid the absolute differences.\n\n              # However, there's another idea: we might be able to close one part from a position that is not the boundary? But we concluded we must be at the boundary.\n\n              # Therefore, the above two options are the only ones.\n\n              # But wait: what if we are already at one boundary? Then we don't need to move for that boundary.\n\n              # Actually, the above formula for option1 and option2 already accounts for the starting position.\n\n              # However, note: we don't necessarily have to traverse from l to r in the middle. But if we close the left part first, then the right part is still at r, but the boundaries have changed. However, the movement from l to r is still |l-r| because the boundaries now are [l, n] (if we closed the left part) and then we can move from l to r (since r is still there). Similarly, if we close the right part first, then the boundaries become [1, r] and then we can move from r to l.\n\n              # Therefore, the two options are correct.\n\n              # But note: sometimes we might be able to do better by closing one part and then not having to move the entire distance to the other part because the closure operation might change the boundaries? Actually, the movement is independent of the closure operation because the closure operation only changes the boundaries (which we know) and the cursor remains at the boundary we just closed from.\n\n              ans = min(option1, option2)\n\n  However, wait: what if we are already at one of the boundaries? Then one of the moves is 0, but that is already considered.\n\n  But wait: there's a catch. After closing one side, the boundaries change, but the movement from the first boundary to the second boundary is still the same (because the distance between l and r is fixed). \n\n  However, consider: if we close the left part first, then the boundaries become [l, n]. Then we are at l. Then we move from l to r: the distance is |l-r|. Similarly, if we close the right part first, then the boundaries become [1, r] and we are at r, then move to l: distance |r-l|.\n\n  So the two options are independent.\n\n  But wait: what if we are already at one boundary? \n\n      Example: n=10, pos=5, l=3, r=7 (both needed). \n\n      Option1: \n          Move from 5 to 3 (|5-3|=2), close left (1), then move from 3 to 7 (|3-7|=4), close right (1) -> total 2+1+4+1 = 8.\n\n      Option2:\n          Move from 5 to 7 (|5-7|=2), close right (1), then move from 7 to 3 (|7-3|=4), close left (1) -> total 2+1+4+1 = 8.\n\n      Now, if we are already at 3 (pos=3):\n\n          Option1: 0 (to 3) + 1 + |3-7| (4) + 1 -> 6.\n          Option2: |3-7|=4 + 1 + 0 (because we are already at 3? but wait, after closing the right part we are at 7, then we move from 7 to 3 (4 steps) and close. So 4+1+4+1 = 10.\n\n      But wait, in Option2 we start at 3, then we move to 7 (4 steps), then close the right part (1), then we are at 7, then we move from 7 to 3 (4 steps) and close (1). So 4+1+4+1=10.\n\n      However, we can choose the order: if we are at 3, we can choose to close the left part first (then we are at 3, then we move to 7 (4 steps) and close the right part). \n\n      So the above formula for Option1 and Option2 is correct: we consider two orders.\n\n  But wait: in the above example, we are at 3 (which is l) and we are not at r (which is 7). Then Option1 gives 0+1+4+1=6, and Option2 gives 4+1+4+1=10, so we choose 6.\n\n  Similarly, if we are at 7 (which is r) and not at l (3), then Option1: |7-3|=4+1+0+1=6, Option2: 0+1+4+1=6.\n\n  Wait, no: if we are at 7, then Option1: \n      Move from 7 to 3: 4, then close left: 1, then we are at 3, then we don't need to move to r (because we are at 3 and r=7, so we have to move from 3 to 7: 4, then close right: 1 -> total 4+1+4+1=10.\n\n  But wait, I see: the Option1 is defined as: \n      First, we go from `pos` to `l` (which is 3) then close left, then go from `l` to `r` (which is 7) then close right.\n\n  So if we are at 7, then the first part (go from 7 to 3) is 4, then close left (1), then go from 3 to 7 (4) and close right (1) -> 10.\n\n  Similarly, Option2: \n      First, go from 7 to 7 (0) then close right (1), then go from 7 to 3 (4) then close left (1) -> 0+1+4+1=6.\n\n  So we must consider that the two orders are distinct.\n\n  But wait, why did I say Option1 for starting at 7: \n      Option1: go to l (3) then to r (7): that's 4 (to go from 7 to 3) and then 4 (from 3 to 7) -> 8 moves, plus 2 closures -> 10.\n\n      Option2: go to r (7) then to l (3): that's 0 (already at 7) then 4 (from 7 to 3) -> 4 moves, plus 2 closures -> 6.\n\n  So the minimal is 6.\n\n  Therefore, the code for the both needed case is:\n\n      ans = min( abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2, abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2 )\n\n  However, note: the absolute differences are symmetric: abs(l-r) = abs(r-l). So we can write:\n\n      ans = min( abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2, abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2 )\n\n  But wait, is that always true? Yes, because abs(a-b)=abs(b-a).\n\n  But note:",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] in her browser. The browser starts with all tabs from 1 to n open, and the cursor is initially at position `pos`. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right (within current boundaries) or closing all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - **Initial Check**: If the desired segment [l, r] covers all tabs (i.e., l = 1 and r = n), no operations are needed.\n   - **Single Side Closure**: If only one side (left or right) needs to be closed, Luba must move the cursor to the boundary (l for left closure, r for right closure) and then perform the closure operation.\n   - **Both Sides Closure**: If both sides need to be closed, Luba has two options:\n     - Move to the left boundary first, close the left side, then move to the right boundary and close the right side.\n     - Move to the right boundary first, close the right side, then move to the left boundary and close the left side.\n   The minimal time is the lesser of the two options.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - The cursor must be at the exact boundary (l or r) to close the respective side without affecting the desired segment.\n   - The movement time is the absolute difference between the current cursor position and the target boundary.\n   - Each closure operation takes 1 second.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - For cases where no closure is needed, return 0.\n   - For single-side closures, calculate the movement time to the boundary plus 1 second for the closure.\n   - For both-side closures, compute both possible paths (left then right, or right then left) and choose the minimal total time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    pos = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    r = int(data[3])\n    \n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    left_needed = (l > 1)\n    right_needed = (r < n)\n    \n    if not left_needed and not right_needed:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    elif left_needed and not right_needed:\n        moves = abs(pos - l)\n        print(moves + 1)\n        return\n    elif not left_needed and right_needed:\n        moves = abs(pos - r)\n        print(moves + 1)\n        return\n    else:\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2\n        print(min(option1, option2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initial Check**: The code first checks if the desired segment [l, r] covers all tabs. If so, it prints 0 since no operations are needed.\n- **Single-Side Closure**: If only the left or right side needs closing, the code calculates the movement time from the initial cursor position to the boundary (l or r) and adds 1 second for the closure operation.\n- **Both-Sides Closure**: For cases requiring both closures, the code computes two scenarios:\n  - Moving from the initial position to the left boundary, closing the left side, then moving to the right boundary and closing the right side.\n  - Moving from the initial position to the right boundary, closing the right side, then moving to the left boundary and closing the left side.\nThe minimal time between these two scenarios is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases by leveraging simple arithmetic and conditional checks to minimize the operations required.",
