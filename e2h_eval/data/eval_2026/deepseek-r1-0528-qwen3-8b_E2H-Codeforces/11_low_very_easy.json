A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n Each bottle has 'l' milliliters. They have k bottles -> total drink = k * l milliliters.\n For a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. But note: the toasts are for the entire group? Actually, the problem says:\n \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast. But they want to make toasts such that each friend gets the same amount.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Calculate the total available drink in milliliters: total_drink = k * l\n 2. Calculate the total available lime slices: from c limes, each cut into d slices -> total_slices = c * d\n\n 3. Now, for one toast, we need:\n    - drink: nl milliliters (per friend per toast) but note: the entire group is making the same number of toasts per friend?\n    Actually, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast.\n\n    But wait: if we are making T toasts per friend, then the total drink required is n * T * nl.\n    Similarly, for salt: total salt required is n * T * np.\n    And for lime: total slices required is n * T (since each toast requires one slice per friend).\n\n 4. Alternatively, we can think: \n    - The drink limits the total number of toasts (per friend) as: floor(total_drink / (n * nl))\n    - The lime limits: floor(total_slices / n)   [because each toast per friend requires one slice, and there are n friends so total slices needed is n * T]\n    - The salt limits: floor(p / (n * np))\n\n 5. However, note: the drink requirement is per friend per toast. So for T toasts per friend, we need:\n    - Drink: T * n * nl <= k * l  => T <= (k * l) / (n * nl)\n    - Lime: T * n <= c * d        => T <= (c * d) / n\n    - Salt: T * n * np <= p       => T <= p / (n * np)\n\n 6. Therefore, the maximum T (toasts per friend) is the minimum of these three values, but we must take integer part (floor) because we can't have fractions of a toast.\n\n But note: the example input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n   n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n   total_drink = 4*5 = 20\n   total_slices = 10*8 = 80\n\n   Drink constraint: T <= 20 / (3*3) = 20/9 ≈ 2.22 -> floor to 2\n   Lime constraint: T <= 80 / 3 ≈ 26.66 -> floor to 26\n   Salt constraint: T <= 100 / (3*1) ≈ 33.33 -> floor to 33\n\n   Then T = min(2, 26, 33) = 2.\n\n 7. However, note: the example output is 2.\n\n 8. But wait, what if we have non-integer values? We must use integer arithmetic and floor division? Actually, we can use:\n\n    drink_toasts = (k * l) // (n * nl)   ? \n\n    However, note: the drink is used by the entire group. But the condition is: n * T * nl <= k * l.\n\n    Actually, we should use:\n\n    T_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)   -> but wait, this is the maximum T such that n * T * nl <= k * l.\n\n    Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n    T_max_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)   [if we use integer division, but note: we must be cautious because if (k*l) is not divisible by (n*nl) then we get the floor]\n\n    However, the example: (4*5) // (3*3) = 20 // 9 = 2 (in integer floor division) -> correct.\n\n    Similarly, for lime: we require T * n <= c*d -> T <= (c*d) // n? But wait",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the constraints imposed by the drink, lime slices, and salt, then find the minimum of these constraints to ensure all friends can partake equally in the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts each friend can make based on three resources: drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a certain amount of each resource per friend. The solution involves:\n   - **Drink Calculation**: Total available drink is `k * l` milliliters. Each toast requires `nl` milliliters per friend. Thus, the maximum number of toasts per friend is limited by `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n   - **Lime Slices Calculation**: Total available lime slices is `c * d`. Each toast requires one slice per friend. Thus, the maximum number of toasts per friend is limited by `(c * d) // n`.\n   - **Salt Calculation**: Total available salt is `p` grams. Each toast requires `np` grams per friend. Thus, the maximum number of toasts per friend is limited by `p // (n * np)`.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The limiting factor is the smallest of the three calculated values (drink, lime, salt). This ensures that no resource is overused and all friends can make the same number of toasts.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves straightforward arithmetic operations to compute the constraints for each resource and then finding the minimum of these values. The use of integer division ensures that we only consider whole toasts.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves a constant number of arithmetic operations, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(1). This is optimal for the given problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_slices = c * d\n    \n    drink_limit = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    lime_limit = total_slices // n\n    salt_limit = p // (n * np)\n    \n    result = min(drink_limit, lime_limit, salt_limit)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The input is read as a single line of space-separated integers. These integers represent the number of friends (`n`), bottles of drink (`k`), milliliters per bottle (`l`), number of limes (`c`), slices per lime (`d`), grams of salt (`p`), milliliters per toast (`nl`), and grams of salt per toast (`np`).\n\n2. **Resource Calculation**:\n   - **Total Drink**: Computed as `k * l`, representing the total milliliters of drink available.\n   - **Total Lime Slices**: Computed as `c * d`, representing the total slices available from all limes.\n\n3. **Constraint Calculation**:\n   - **Drink Limit**: The maximum number of toasts per friend is determined by dividing the total drink by the product of the number of friends and the drink per toast (`n * nl`), using integer division.\n   - **Lime Limit**: The maximum number of toasts per friend is determined by dividing the total lime slices by the number of friends (`n`), again using integer division.\n   - **Salt Limit**: The maximum number of toasts per friend is determined by dividing the total salt by the product of the number of friends and the salt per toast (`n * np`), using integer division.\n\n4. **Result Calculation**: The smallest of the three calculated limits (drink, lime, salt) is chosen as the result, ensuring that no resource is exhausted before the others and all friends can make the same number of toasts.\n\n5. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the maximum number of toasts each friend can make under the given constraints. \n\nThis approach efficiently leverages basic arithmetic operations to solve the problem within the constraints, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
