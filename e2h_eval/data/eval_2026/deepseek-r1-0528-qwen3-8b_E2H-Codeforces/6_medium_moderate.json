Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n and x, then n lines of (li, ri, costi)\n Conditions: \n   - We need two distinct vouchers i and j such that:\n        (ri - li + 1) + (rj - lj + 1) = x   [total duration is x]\n   - The two vouchers do not intersect: meaning either ri < lj or rj < li.\n\n Steps:\n\n Observation: The total duration condition is (duration_i + duration_j = x). So if we let d_i = ri - li + 1, then we require d_i + d_j = x.\n\n Also, the two vouchers must be disjoint. This means that one voucher must end before the other starts.\n\n Approach:\n\n 1. Precompute the duration for each voucher.\n 2. We are going to group the vouchers by their duration. For a given duration d, we want to consider all vouchers with that duration and also keep track of their intervals (li, ri) so that we can check non-overlapping condition.\n\n However, note: we have two conditions for non-overlapping: \n      Condition 1: voucher i ends before voucher j starts -> ri < lj\n      Condition 2: voucher j ends before voucher i starts -> rj < li\n\n But note: since the total duration is fixed (d_i + d_j = x), we can let d_i = d, then d_j = x - d.\n\n Then, for a voucher i with duration d and interval [l1, r1] (so l1 = li, r1 = ri) and a voucher j with duration x-d and interval [l2, r2], we require:\n      Either r1 < l2 OR r2 < l1.\n\n How to efficiently find the minimal cost?\n\n Idea:\n\n  - We can create an array (or dictionary) `by_duration` that maps a duration d to a list of (l, r, cost) for all vouchers with that duration.\n\n  - Then, for each duration d (from 1 to maybe max_duration, but note x up to 200000, and durations can be from 1 to 200000) and its complement d2 = x - d, we consider pairs of vouchers: one from d and one from d2.\n\n  - But the total number of vouchers might be large (n up to 200000) and we cannot iterate over all pairs.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n  Let's precompute for each duration d, we want to store the vouchers by their starting day (or ending day) and then for a fixed pair (d, x-d) we want to quickly find:\n\n    Option 1: A voucher i (with duration d) and a voucher j (with duration x-d) such that r_i < l_j (and similarly for the other condition).\n\n  But note: the condition is symmetric? Actually, the two conditions are complementary. However, we can break the problem into two cases:\n\n    Case 1: The first voucher ends before the second starts (r_i < l_j). Then we require that the first voucher (with duration d) has an end day less than the start day of the second voucher (with duration x-d).\n\n    Case 2: The second voucher ends before the first starts (r_j < l_i). Then we require that the second voucher (with duration x-d) has an end day less than the start day of the first voucher (with duration d).\n\n  However, note that the condition is symmetric in the sense that we can consider both orders. But we are iterating over d and x-d. Since d and x-d are fixed, we can consider:\n\n    For a fixed d (and hence x-d) we want to look for:\n\n        Voucher i in d: (l_i, r_i, cost_i) and Voucher j in x-d: (l_j, r_j, cost_j) such that r_i < l_j.\n\n    Then the total cost is cost_i + cost_j.\n\n  Similarly, we can also look for:\n\n        Voucher i in d: (l_i, r_i, cost_i) and Voucher j in x-d: (l_j, r_j, cost_j) such that r_j < l_i.\n\n  But note: the condition is actually the same as above if we swap i and j? Actually, no: in the first case we require the first voucher to end before the second starts, and in the second case the second voucher must end before the first starts. However, when we fix the two sets (set D: duration d and set E: duration x-d), then we can consider two different ways the two vouchers can be ordered.\n\n  However, note: the condition \"don't intersect\" is defined as at least one of the two conditions holds. But if we have two vouchers, one from D and one from E, then we have two possibilities: either the D voucher comes first or the E voucher comes first.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n    For each d in the set of durations (for which we have at least one voucher and also x-d exists):\n\n        Consider set A = all vouchers with duration d, and set B = all vouchers with duration x-d.\n\n        Then, we want to consider two cases:\n\n            Case 1: A voucher from A must end before a voucher from B starts.\n            Case 2: A voucher from B must end before a voucher from A starts.\n\n        But note: the two cases are independent. We can combine by considering that the two vouchers must be disjoint, so either the A voucher ends before the B voucher starts, or the B voucher ends before the A voucher starts.\n\n        However, we can also think: without loss of generality, we can assume that the first voucher is from A and the second from B, then the condition is r_A < l_B. Then, we can also consider the reverse: the first voucher is from B and the second from A, then the condition is r_B < l_A.\n\n        But note: our grouping by duration does not enforce an order. So we can simply consider:\n\n          For each d, we consider the set of vouchers with duration d and the set with duration x-d.\n\n          Then, we want to find:\n\n            min { cost_i + cost_j } for (i in A, j in B) such that (r_i < l_j) OR (r_j < l_i)\n\n        However, we cannot iterate over all pairs.\n\n  How to do it efficiently?\n\n  We can preprocess the vouchers by their duration and by their time intervals.\n\n  Idea:\n\n    For each duration d, we will store:\n\n        - A sorted list of the start days (l) for all vouchers of duration d? Not enough.\n\n    Alternatively, we can store:\n\n        For each duration d, we store two things:\n\n            1. The minimal cost for a voucher of duration d that ends by a certain day (or starts after a certain day) — but we need to relate the end day.\n\n        Actually, for the condition \"r_i < l_j\", we can:\n\n            For set A (duration d): we want to consider only those vouchers that have ended by a certain day (so that a voucher from B with start day > r_i is available).\n\n            Similarly, for set B (duration x-d): we want to consider only those vouchers that start after a given day.\n\n        But note: we are looking for the minimal cost combination.\n\n  Steps for fixed d and x-d:\n\n    Let d1 = d, d2 = x-d.\n\n    We want to consider:\n\n        Case 1: Use a voucher from d1 (A) and a voucher from d2 (B) such that A's end day < B's start day.\n\n        Case 2: Use a voucher from d2 (B) and a voucher from d1 (A) such that B's end day < A's start day.\n\n    However, note: the condition in the problem is symmetric. But we are allowed to use any two. And the two conditions are independent.\n\n    But wait: the condition \"don't intersect\" is defined as at least one of the two. However, if we have two vouchers and they are disjoint, then exactly one of the two conditions holds (unless they are adjacent, but that's still disjoint). Actually, if one condition holds, the other doesn't necessarily hold. But note: if the first ends before the second starts, then the second certainly doesn't end before the first starts (because the second starts after the first ends, so the second starts after the first starts? Not necessarily: the first could be [1,3] and the second [4,5] — then the first ends at 3 which is < 4 (start of second). The second ends at 5 which is >= 1 (start of first) but the condition for the second being entirely before the first is not satisfied. \n\n    However, the problem says \"at least one\" of the two conditions. So if one holds, we don't care about the other.\n\n    Therefore, we can break the problem into two independent problems:\n\n        Problem 1: Find two vouchers (one from d1, one from d2) such that the first ends before the second starts (so the first is entirely before the second).\n\n        Problem 2: Find two vouchers (one from d2, one from d1) such that the second ends before the first starts (so the second is entirely before the first).\n\n    But note: the two problems are essentially the same: we are just swapping the roles. So we can do:\n\n        For a fixed d (and d2=x-d) we consider:\n\n            Case 1: A from d, B from d2, and we require A's end < B's start.\n\n            Case 2: A from d2, B from d, and we require B's end < A's start.\n\n        However, note: in our grouping, we have stored the vouchers by duration. So we can do:\n\n            For each d (we iterate over d from 1 to max_duration, but only when d <= x//2 and x-d is positive and exists):\n\n                Let A = list of (l, r, cost) for duration d.\n                Let B = list of (l, r, cost) for duration x-d.\n\n                Then, we want to find:\n\n                    min_{a in A, b in B} { cost_a + cost_b } such that a.r < b.l   [Case 1]\n\n                    min_{a in A, b in B} { cost_a + cost_b } such that b.r < a.l   [Case 2]\n\n        Then take the minimum of these two and then update the global answer.\n\n    But the challenge is to do this without iterating over every pair.\n\n  How to optimize?\n\n    For Case 1: A from d, B from x-d, condition: a.r < b.l.\n\n        We can preprocess set B (vouchers with duration x-d) by sorting them by their start day (l) and then for each voucher in A (with end day r) we need to consider all vouchers in B that have start day > r.\n\n        Then, we want the minimal cost in set B for all vouchers that have start day > r.\n\n        Similarly, for set A, we can sort by end day (or by r) and then use a segment tree or a Fenwick tree? Or we can precompute for set B an array of the minimal cost for any voucher in B with start day >= some value.\n\n        Steps for Case 1:\n\n            Step 1: Sort set B (duration x-d) by l (start day). Then, we want to quickly query: for a given r (from a voucher in A), what is the minimal cost of a voucher in B that has l > r.\n\n            Step 2: Similarly, we can precompute for set B: \n                - Sort B by l (start day). Then, we can also create an array of the minimal cost for vouchers from B from index i to the end (as we traverse from high l to low l? Actually, we want for a given r, all b in B with l>r. So if we sort B by l (in increasing order), then we can use a suffix minimum array (min_cost_from_index) for B.\n\n            Step 3: For each voucher a in A (duration d): \n                - Condition: a.r < b.l. We can binary search in B (sorted by l) for the first voucher that has l > a.r. Then, from that position to the end, we have the minimal cost (from the suffix minimum array) and then add a.cost.\n\n            Then, the candidate for Case 1 is the minimal value found.\n\n        Similarly, for Case 2: condition b.r < a.l (where a is from A and b from B).\n\n            Step 1: Now, we require for a given voucher b in B (duration x-d): we want to find a voucher a in A (duration d) such that a.l > b.r.\n\n            Step 2: Sort set A by l (start day) and precompute a prefix minimum array for cost? Actually, we want the minimal cost for any voucher in A that has l > b.r.\n\n            But note: we want the minimal cost for a in A with l > b.r.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                Sort A by l (in increasing order) and then create an array for the minimal cost from the beginning to the current index? Actually, we want from the point where l > b.r to the end. So we can do:\n\n                    Sort A by l, then create a suffix minimum array for the cost (from the last element backwards).\n\n            However, note: the condition is on the start day of A: we require a.l > b.r. So we can:\n\n                Sort A by l (increasing). Then, we want the minimal cost among all a in A with l > b.r.\n\n                We can create an array `min_cost_from_index` for A: from the largest l to the smallest, the minimal cost from that index to the end.\n\n            Then, for each b in B (duration x-d): \n                - Condition: b.r < a.l. We can binary search in A (sorted by l) for the first a with l > b.r, then use the suffix minimum array for A to get the minimal cost from that index.\n\n            Then, the candidate for Case 2 is the minimal value found.\n\n    Then, the candidate for this d is the minimum between the candidate from Case 1 and Case 2.\n\n    Then, we iterate over d from 1 to (x//2) (if d <= x-d, and both d and x-d exist).\n\n  But note: what if d == x-d? Then we are considering the same set for both A and B. Then we must choose two distinct vouchers from the same set. Then the condition is either the first ends before the second starts, or the second ends before the first starts. However, note that the condition is the same as above. But we must ensure that we don't pick the same voucher twice. But our grouping by duration d would have the same set for A and B. Then, in Case 1 and Case 2, we are effectively checking the same set of pairs (but in two different orders). However, we must avoid using the same voucher twice.\n\n    How to handle when d == x-d?\n\n        We are storing the same set for A and B. Then, we must make sure that we do not use the same voucher for both.\n\n        But note: the condition in Case 1: we require a voucher from A and a voucher from B (which is the same set). Then, we are effectively allowing the same voucher? Actually, no: because the two vouchers must be distinct. However, in our iteration, we are treating A and B as separate lists. But if d==x-d, then A and B are the same list? Not exactly: we split the original list of vouchers by duration. If two vouchers have the same duration, they are in the same list. Then, if we are using the same list for A and B, then we are considering pairs within the same list.\n\n        But the problem requires two distinct vouchers.\n\n        How did we store? We stored for duration d, all vouchers with that duration. Then, if d==x-d, then we are taking the same list for A and B. Then, we must ensure that we do not pick the same voucher.\n\n        However, note: our method for Case 1 and Case 2 uses two separate lists (even if they are the same set). Then, when we consider a voucher a from A and a voucher b from B, we are not enforcing that a and b are distinct. But wait: in the input, the same voucher might appear multiple times? The problem says: n vouchers, each line describes one. They are distinct. But the same duration? Yes, there can be multiple vouchers with the same duration.\n\n        However, if d==x-d, then we are considering two distinct vouchers from the same set. So we must avoid using the same voucher twice.\n\n        But note: in Case 1, we require a from A and b from B (which is the same set). The condition is a.r < b.l. But if a voucher is used twice, then we must check that a and b are distinct.\n\n        However, the problem states: choose exactly two vouchers (i ≠ j). So we must not use the same voucher.\n\n        How to handle? \n\n        We can do:\n\n          In Case 1: we consider two separate lists (even if they are the same set) but then we must not use the same element.\n\n          But note: we are storing the entire list for duration d and then using the same list for both A and B. Then, when we consider a and b, we are considering two different vouchers? Actually, no: the same voucher can appear twice if we don't remove duplicates. But the input doesn't have duplicate vouchers (each voucher is distinct). However, the same duration can have multiple vouchers.\n\n          But if we are using the same list for A and B, then we are effectively considering every pair (a, b) from the same set, including (a, a) if we don't remove self-pairs. But wait: the problem requires two distinct vouchers.\n\n          Therefore, in Case 1, we must ensure that a and b are distinct.\n\n          However, note: the condition a.r < b.l implies that a and b are distinct? Not necessarily: if the same voucher appears twice (with the same interval) then we might have a voucher [1,2] and then another identical voucher [1,2]. Then, if we have two identical vouchers, then the condition a.r < b.l would be 2 < 1? false. So even if the same voucher is duplicated, the condition fails. But if we have two identical vouchers, then we can use them if the condition holds? Actually, no: if we have two identical vouchers [1,2] and [1,2], then the condition for disjointness: \n                Condition 1: 2 < 1 -> false.\n                Condition 2: 2 < 1 -> false.\n          So they are not disjoint.\n\n          Therefore, even if we have two identical vouchers, they are not disjoint. So we don't need to worry about using the same voucher twice in the same set? Actually, no: because the condition requires the intervals to be disjoint. Two identical intervals are not disjoint.\n\n          Therefore, in our Case 1 and Case 2, we are safe because the condition a.r < b.l (or b.r < a.l) already ensures they are distinct and disjoint.\n\n        But wait: what if we have two vouchers with the same duration d and they are disjoint? Then we can use them. However, the condition a.r < b.l (or b.r < a.l) must hold. \n\n        Example: two vouchers [1,2] and [3,4] (both duration 2). Then, condition: 2 < 3 -> true. So we can use them.\n\n        So we don't need to worry about distinctness beyond the condition. The condition naturally requires the two intervals to be disjoint and hence distinct.\n\n        However, note: if we have two identical disjoint intervals, say [1,2] and [3,4] (same duration) then they are distinct. The condition holds because 2<3.\n\n        But what if we have two identical intervals that are not overlapping? Actually, the condition is on the intervals: [1,2] and [3,4] are not overlapping.\n\n        So the problem reduces to: for each d (from 1 to max_duration) and d2 = x-d, if d <= d2 and both d and d2 exist, then:\n\n            Case 1: \n                A = list of (l, r, cost) for duration d\n                B = list of (l, r, cost) for duration d2\n\n                Sort B by l (start day). Then, for each voucher in A, we want to find the minimal cost in B for which l > a.r.\n\n                Then candidate1 = min_{a in A} { a.cost + (minimal cost in B with l>a.r) }\n\n            Case 2:\n                Similarly, we can do the same but with A and B swapped: \n                Sort A by l (start day). Then, for each voucher in B, we want to find the minimal cost in A for which l > b.r.\n\n                Then candidate2 = min_{b in B} { b.cost + (minimal cost in A with l>b.r) }\n\n            Then candidate = min(candidate1, candidate2)\n\n        Then, update the global answer.\n\n  However, note: the problem allows d to be greater than d2? Actually, we are iterating d from 1 to max_duration, and we only consider d <= x-d (to avoid double counting). But what if d > x-d? Then we skip. But note: we must consider both d and x-d. But if we consider d and then x-d (which is less than d) then we will cover the same pair again. So we should iterate d from 1 to floor(x/2). But note: if x is even, then d = x/2 is the middle. We must consider d = x/2 only once.\n\n  Steps:\n\n    Let's create a dictionary (or defaultdict) that maps duration -> list of (l, r, cost)\n\n    Let ans = a very large number (or infinity)\n\n    For d in the keys of the dictionary (that we consider only if d <= x-d and x-d is in the dictionary, or if d <= x-d and x-d exists even if not in the dictionary? Actually, we only consider d for which x-d is present). So:\n\n        Let dict_d = defaultdict(list)\n        For each voucher (l, r, cost):\n            d = r-l+1\n            append (l, r, cost) to dict_d[d]\n\n        Then, we consider d from 1 to x (but we can iterate over the keys). However, we must consider that if d > x, then skip. But note: d = r-l+1, and r and l are at most 200000, so d is at most 200000, and x is at most 200000.\n\n        We can iterate over the keys that are in the range [1, x] and for which d <= x-d.\n\n        But note: if x-d is not in the dictionary, then skip.\n\n    Steps for each d (if d <= x-d and x-d in dict_d):\n\n        Let A = dict_d[d]   (list of tuples (l, r, cost))\n        Let B = dict_d[x-d] (list of tuples (l, r, cost))\n\n        Then, for Case 1: \n            Condition: a.r < b.l\n\n            We want to compute: \n                candidate1 = inf\n                For each a in A:\n                    We need the minimal cost in B for which l > a.r.\n\n            To do that, we can:\n\n                Sort B by l (the start day). Then, we can also create an array for the minimal cost in B from the current index to the end (suffix minimum) based on l.\n\n                Steps for B:\n                    Sort B by l (increasing). Then, we can create an array min_suffix[i] = minimum cost from index i to the end.\n\n                Then, for a given a with end day = a.r, we need to find the smallest index j in B such that B[j][0] (start day) > a.r.\n\n                Then, if j exists, candidate1 = min(candidate1, a.cost + min_suffix[j])\n\n        Similarly, for Case 2: \n            Condition: b.r < a.l\n\n            We want to compute:\n                candidate2 = inf\n                For each b in B:\n                    We need the minimal cost in A for which l > b.r.\n\n            Steps for A:\n                Sort A by l (increasing). Then, create an array min_suffix_A[i] = minimum cost from index i to the end.\n\n            Then, for a given b with end day = b.r, we need to find the smallest index i in A such that A[i][0] (start day) > b.r.\n\n            Then, candidate2 = min(candidate2, b.cost + min_suffix_A[i])\n\n        Then, candidate = min(candidate1, candidate2)\n\n        Then, update global_ans = min(global_ans, candidate)\n\n    But note: there's a possibility that the same pair (a,b) is considered in both Case 1 and Case 2? Actually, no: because in Case 1 we require a.r < b.l, and in Case 2 we require b.r < a.l. These are two different conditions.\n\n    However, note: if the two conditions hold simultaneously, then we have two different ways to account for the same pair? Actually, the two conditions are mutually exclusive? Not necessarily: if the two intervals are disjoint and the first ends before the second starts, then the second condition (second ends before the first starts) is automatically false? Because the first ends at a.r and the second starts at b.l (which is > a.r) and the second ends at b.r, and the first starts at a.l. Then, we require b.r < a.l? But a.l is the start of the first, and the second starts at b.l (which is > a.r) and the first starts at a.l (which is <= a.r). Since a.r < b.l, then a.l <= a.r < b.l <= b.r, so the entire first interval is before the entire second interval. Then, the second condition (b.r < a.l) is false because a.l <= a.r < b.l <= b.r. Similarly, if the second condition holds, then the first condition does not.\n\n    Therefore, the two cases are disjoint.\n\n  Implementation details:\n\n    We need to:\n\n        Precompute a dictionary mapping duration to list of (l, r, cost)\n\n        Then, for each d (only if d <= x-d and x-d in the dictionary):\n\n            A = dict_d[d]   (list of (l, r, cost))\n            B = dict_d[x-d] (list of (l, r, cost))\n\n            For Case 1 (A and B):\n\n                Step 1: Sort B by l (start day). Then, we need to extract the start day and the cost. Then, create an array for the suffix minimum of cost in B (based on the sorted order by l).\n\n                How to do the suffix minimum? We can:\n\n                    Sort B by l (so we have list of tuples (l, r, cost) sorted by l). Then, we can create a new list for the costs from the last element to the first: \n                        min_suffix_B[i] = minimum value of cost from index i to the last.\n\n                Step 2: For each a in A, we have an end day = a[1] (since a = (l, r, cost)). Then, we want to find the first index in B (the sorted B) such that l > a[1] (i.e., the start day of B is greater than a's end day).\n\n                We can use bisect_right or bisect_left? \n\n                    We have sorted B by l. We want the first index j such that B[j][0] > a[1].\n\n                    We can do: \n                        pos = bisect.bisect_right(B_l, a[1])   # returns the insertion position, but note: B_l is the list of start days of B.\n\n                    Actually, we have the entire B sorted by l. Let's extract the start days for B: \n                        B_sorted = sorted(B, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                        B_l = [item[0] for item in B_sorted]\n\n                    Then, we want the first index j such that B_sorted[j][0] > a[1]. That is the same as:\n\n                        j = bisect.bisect_right(B_l, a[1])   # returns the insertion position, so the element at j is the first one > a[1]? Actually, bisect_right returns the insertion position to maintain sorted order, and if there are duplicates, it returns after the last occurrence of a[1]. Then, the element at j is the first one that is > a[1].\n\n                    Then, if j < len(B_sorted), then the minimal cost in B from j to the end is min_suffix_B[j].\n\n                    Then candidate1 = min(candidate1, a[2] + min_suffix_B[j])\n\n            Similarly, for Case 2 (B and A):\n\n                Step 1: Sort A by l (start day). Then, create an array for the suffix minimum of cost in A (based on the sorted order by l).\n\n                Step 2: For each b in B, we have an end day = b[1]. Then, we want to find the first index i in A (the sorted A) such that A[i][0] > b[1].\n\n                Then, candidate2 = min(candidate2, b[2] + min_suffix_A[i])\n\n            Then, update global_ans = min(global_ans, candidate1, candidate2)\n\n    Finally, if global_ans remains the initial large value, output -1, else output global_ans.\n\n  But note: we must be cautious about the performance.\n\n    The total number of vouchers is n (up to 200000). Then, we are iterating over each d (which is at most 200000 distinct durations) and for each d, we are doing:\n\n        Sorting B (which is the list for duration x-d) and A (for d) and building suffix arrays. Then, for each element in A (for Case 1) and each element in B (for Case 2) we do a binary search.\n\n    However, the total number of distinct durations is at most 200000, but the sum of the sizes of all the lists is n (each voucher is in one list). But note: we are iterating over each distinct duration d (that satisfies the condition) and for each d we process the two lists (A and B). The total work over all d would be:\n\n        For each distinct duration d (that we consider) we process the two lists (A and B). But note: the same voucher may be part of multiple d? No, each voucher has one duration.\n\n        However, the same voucher is only in one list. But the distinct durations we consider: we only consider d such that d <= x-d and x-d exists. The total distinct durations we consider is at most O(n) (each voucher gives one duration) but we are grouping by duration.\n\n        But the catch: the same list (for a particular duration) is processed multiple times? Actually, no: for a fixed duration d, we process it only once (when we are considering d and then again when we are considering x-d, if d != x-d). But wait: if d != x-d, then when we consider d, we use the list for d and the list for x-d. Then, when we consider x-d, we use the list for x-d and the list for d (again). So we are processing the same pair of lists twice (if d != x-d). \n\n        Example: x=10, d=2, then we consider d=2 and d2=8. Then, later when d=8, we consider d=8 and d2=2. So we do the same thing twice.\n\n        To avoid double counting, we should consider only d <= x-d. Then, for d=2, we consider (2,8) and for d=8, we don't because 8>10-8=2. So we only consider d=2.\n\n        But wait: we are iterating over the keys. We can iterate over the keys that are <= x/2. Then, we only consider d from 1 to floor(x/2). Then, we avoid double counting.\n\n        However, what if d == x-d? Then we consider d exactly once (if d <= x-d, which is true because d = x-d, then d <= x-d -> 2*d <= x). Then, we process the list for d and the same list for x-d (which is d) only once.\n\n    Therefore, we can:\n\n        Let durations = list of keys in dict_d (the dictionary) that are <= x//2 and for which x-d is in dict_d (or if d<=x-d and x-d exists).\n\n        Then, for each d in durations:\n\n            A = dict_d[d]\n            B = dict_d[x-d]\n\n            Then, do Case 1 and Case 2.\n\n    But note: if x-d is not in the dictionary, we skip.\n\n    How to get the list of keys? We can:\n\n        keys = [d for d in dict_d.keys() if d <= x-d and (x-d) in dict_d]\n\n        But note: if d==0? Our d is at least 1 (since duration is at least 1). And x>=2.\n\n    However, the condition d<=x-d is equivalent to 2*d <= x. So we can also write:\n\n        keys = [d for d in dict_d.keys() if 2*d <= x and (x-d) in dict_d]\n\n    But note: if d<=x-d, then 2*d <= x, and conversely. So we can use either.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  Time complexity: \n\n        The total number of distinct durations is at most 200000, but the sum of the sizes of all the lists is n (200000). \n\n        However, we are iterating over each distinct duration d (that satisfies the condition). For each d, we do:\n\n            Sort the list for duration d (if d==x-d, then we use the same list twice? Actually, no: we have two lists: A (for d) and B (for x-d). And if d==x-d, then we use the same list for A and B.\n\n        But note: we are storing the lists by duration. So for a given duration d, we have one list. Then, when d==x-d, we use the same list for both A and B.\n\n        The total work is:\n\n            For each distinct duration d (that we consider) we sort the list for d (if d==x-d, then we use the same list for both A and B, but we are going to sort it twice? That's inefficient).\n\n        We can avoid that by pre-sorting the lists for each duration and storing the sorted version and the suffix array.\n\n        But note: we are iterating over d from 1 to floor(x/2). The total distinct durations we consider is at most 200000. But the total number of vouchers is 200000, so the sum of the lengths of the lists for all distinct durations is 200000.\n\n        However, if we sort each list for a duration multiple times (once per distinct d that uses that duration as part of a pair) then the total time could be O(n^2 log n) in the worst-case.\n\n        Actually, we are only considering each distinct duration d (that satisfies the condition) once. But a particular duration d0 might appear as part of a pair (d0, x-d0) and also as part of (x-d0, d0) but we avoid the latter by only considering d0 <= x-d0. \n\n        However, note: if d0 appears as a key and also x-d0 appears as a key, then we consider the pair (d0, x-d0) only once (when d0<=x-d0). \n\n        But the same list for duration d0 is used only once (in the pair (d0, x-d0)).\n\n        However, if we are going to use the same list for two different pairs? \n\n        Example: \n            Suppose we have three durations: d1, d2, d3 = x-d1, and d4 = x-d2 (with d1, d2, d3, d4 distinct). Then, the list for d1 is used in the pair (d1, d3) and the list for d2 is used in the pair (d2, d4). \n\n        But the same list is not reused in multiple pairs. Each list is stored by duration and we only use the list for a duration once (when we consider the pair (d, x-d) for d being that duration).\n\n        However, the problem: we are iterating over the keys (distinct durations) that satisfy the condition. Then, for each key d, we get two lists: one for d and one for x-d.\n\n        The total work is:\n\n            For each distinct duration d (that satisfies the condition) we:\n\n                Sort the list for duration d (if we haven't sorted it before) and the list for duration x-d.\n\n            But note: the same list (for a fixed duration d') might be used in multiple pairs? \n\n            Example: \n                Suppose we have two pairs: (d1, x-d1) and (d2, x-d1) [if d2 != d1 and d2 != x-d1?] — no, because the condition is that we consider d<=x-d. So the list for x-d1 will be used when d = x-d1? Only if x-d1 <= x - (x-d1) i.e., x-d1 <=",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two distinct travel vouchers such that the sum of their durations equals exactly `x` (the total vacation days), and the vouchers do not overlap in time. The goal is to minimize the total cost of these two vouchers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires selecting two non-overlapping vouchers where the sum of their durations is exactly `x`. Each voucher is characterized by its start day (`l`), end day (`r`), and cost. The key challenge is efficiently checking all possible pairs of vouchers without resorting to a brute-force approach, which would be computationally expensive.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each voucher, we can determine the required complementary duration (`x - duration_i`) and then search for vouchers of that duration that do not overlap with the current voucher. To optimize, we group vouchers by their duration and preprocess each group to quickly find non-overlapping vouchers.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Grouping by Duration**: Create a dictionary where each key is a duration, and the value is a list of tuples representing the start day, end day, and cost of vouchers with that duration.\n   - **Binary Search and Suffix Arrays**: For each duration `d`, we sort the corresponding list of vouchers by their start day and compute a suffix minimum array (to store the minimum cost from any position to the end of the sorted list). This allows us to efficiently find the minimal cost voucher that starts after a given end day.\n   - **Checking Valid Pairs**: For each voucher in a duration `d`, we check if there exists a voucher in the complementary duration (`x - d`) that starts after the end of the current voucher (or vice versa) using binary search and the suffix arrays.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each voucher once during grouping and sorting. Sorting each group takes O(n log n) in the worst case, but since each voucher is part of one group, the total sorting time is O(n log n). The binary searches and suffix array constructions add O(n log n) time overall. Thus, the solution efficiently handles the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n        \n    it = iter(data)\n    n = int(next(it)); x = int(next(it))\n    vouchers = []\n    max_day = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(next(it)); r = int(next(it)); cost = int(next(it))\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost))\n        max_day = max(max_day, r)\n        \n    dict_d = defaultdict(list)\n    for (l, r, cost) in vouchers:\n        d = r - l + 1\n        dict_d[d].append((l, r, cost))\n        \n    ans = float('inf')\n    \n    considered = set()\n    keys_sorted = sorted(dict_d.keys())\n    for d in keys_sorted:\n        d2 = x - d\n        if d > d2:\n            continue\n        if d2 not in dict_d:\n            continue\n        if (d, d2) in considered or (d2, d) in considered:\n            continue\n        considered.add((d, d2))\n        considered.add((d2, d))\n        \n        A = dict_d[d]\n        B = dict_d[d2]\n        \n        candidate1 = float('inf')\n        candidate2 = float('inf')\n        \n        if A and B:\n            B_sorted = sorted(B, key=lambda x: x[0])\n            B_l = [item[0] for item in B_sorted]\n            costs_B = [item[2] for item in B_sorted]\n            min_suffix_B = [0] * len(B_sorted)\n            if B_sorted:\n                min_suffix_B[-1] = costs_B[-1]\n                for i in range(len(B_sorted)-2, -1, -1):\n                    min_suffix_B[i] = min(min_suffix_B[i+1], costs_B[i])\n            \n            for a in A:\n                r_val = a[1]\n                pos = bisect.bisect_right(B_l, r_val)\n                if pos < len(B_sorted):\n                    total_cost = a[2] + min_suffix_B[pos]\n                    if total_cost < candidate1:\n                        candidate1 = total_cost\n                        \n            A_sorted = sorted(A, key=lambda x: x[0])\n            A_l = [item[0] for item in A_sorted]\n            costs_A = [item[2] for item in A_sorted]\n            min_suffix_A = [0] * len(A_sorted)\n            if A_sorted:\n                min_suffix_A[-1] = costs_A[-1]\n                for i in range(len(A_sorted)-2, -1, -1):\n                    min_suffix_A[i] = min(min_suffix_A[i+1], costs_A[i])\n                    \n            for b in B:\n                r_val = b[1]\n                pos = bisect.bisect_right(A_l, r_val)\n                if pos < len(A_sorted):\n                    total_cost = b[2] + min_suffix_A[pos]\n                    if total_cost < candidate2:\n                        candidate2 = total_cost\n                        \n            candidate = min(candidate1, candidate2)\n            if candidate < ans:\n                ans = candidate\n                \n    if ans == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed into a list of tuples, each representing a voucher's start day, end day, and cost.\n2. **Grouping Vouchers**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration (end day minus start day plus one) into a dictionary where each key is a duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration.\n3. **Processing Pairs**: For each duration `d`, the complementary duration `x - d` is checked. If both durations exist, the algorithm checks for non-overlapping pairs between the two groups.\n4. **Binary Search and Suffix Arrays**: For each voucher in the first group, the algorithm uses binary search to find vouchers in the second group that start after the current voucher ends. A suffix array helps in quickly retrieving the minimal cost voucher meeting this condition.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The minimal cost from valid pairs is tracked and printed. If no valid pairs are found, `-1` is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using sorting and binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
