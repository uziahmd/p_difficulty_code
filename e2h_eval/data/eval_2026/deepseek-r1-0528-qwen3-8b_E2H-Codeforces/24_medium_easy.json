She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n The idea is to consider that we only need to leave the tabs from l to r. The other tabs (those < l and those > r) must be closed.\n\n There are two types of operations:\n  1. Move the cursor left or right (each move takes 1 second, and the movement is bounded by the current minimum and maximum unclosed tabs)\n  2. Close all tabs to the left of the cursor or to the right of the cursor (each close operation takes 1 second)\n\n However, note that after closing some tabs, the boundaries (a and b) change.\n\n Observation: We can break the problem into two parts: \n   - Closing all tabs to the left of l (if any) and \n   - Closing all tabs to the right of r (if any).\n\n But note: we can also close from both sides and then move the cursor to an appropriate position.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider that we must end up with the segment [l, r]. \n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If the entire range [1, n] is already [l, r] (i.e., l==1 and r==n), then we don't need to do anything.\n\n 2. We have to consider how many moves and closes are necessary.\n\n Let's denote:\n   - The initial cursor position is `pos`.\n   - The desired segment is [l, r].\n\n We might do:\n\n Option 1: Close the left part first, then the right part.\n Option 2: Close the right part first, then the left part.\n Option 3: Maybe we can use a combination of moves and closes in a smarter way.\n\n However, note that the problem says that when we close, the boundaries update. Also, we can move the cursor within the current boundaries.\n\n Important: When we close, say, the left part, then the new boundaries become [current_cursor, b] (where b is the old maximum). Similarly for closing the right.\n\n But note: we are allowed to close either the left or the right. And we can move arbitrarily (within the current boundaries) until we are at the desired tab for a close.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require to leave the cursor at a particular place.\n\n Let me think of cases:\n\n Case 1: The current tab set is [1, n] and we want [l, r].\n   - We must close [1, l-1] and [r+1, n].\n\n We can do:\n   a) Move the cursor to l-1 (if exists) and then close the left? Actually, wait: if we are at a position i, we can close the left (which will close from the current minimum to i-1) and similarly for the right.\n\n But note: if we are at a position i, then closing the left will close from the current minimum (which initially is 1) to i-1. Similarly, closing the right will close from i+1 to the current maximum.\n\n So, to close the left part [1, l-1], we must be at a tab that is >= l (so that the left close operation doesn't accidentally close too much) OR we can be anywhere as long as we are going to close the left from the left boundary?\n\n Actually, the operation \"close all the tabs to the left\" will close from the current minimum (a) to i-1. So if we are at a tab i, then we can close the left part [a, i-1]. To close [1, l-1] we must be at a tab i such that i-1 >= l-1? Actually, we require that the entire [1, l-1] is contained in [a, i-1]. Since a starts at 1, we must have i-1 >= l-1, so i >= l. Similarly, to close [r+1, n] we must be at a tab i such that i <= r (so that the right close operation [i+1, b] covers [r+1, n] and we are not leaving any).\n\n But note: the problem allows multiple operations and the boundaries change.\n\n Alternate approach: \n\n We note that the final state has boundaries [l, r]. So we must close two segments: [1, l-1] and [r+1, n].\n\n We can do:\n\n   Option A: \n     Step 1: Move the cursor to the left until we are at l (or beyond? but we must cover [1, l-1]). Actually, to close the left part we must be at a tab i such that i >= l (so that [1, l-1] is contained in [a, i-1] because a is initially 1). Then we can close the left.\n\n     But wait: we might not need to be exactly at l. We just need to be at a tab i>=l so that i-1 >= l-1 (which is always true if i>=l). However, we might also consider moving to the right first.\n\n   Option B: \n     Step 1: Move the cursor to the right until we are at r (to close the right part). Then close the right.\n\n However, we can also do:\n\n   Step 1: Move to the left to l (if we are at pos, then we move left |pos-l| steps to get to l).\n   Step 2: Close the left (if there is any tab to the left of l, i.e., if l>1) -> then we remove [1, l-1].\n   Then the boundaries become [l, n] and the cursor is at l.\n\n   Step 3: Then we need to close the right [r+1, n]. Now, we are at l, which is <= r (since l<=r). So we can move to the right from l to r (which takes |r-l| seconds) and then close the right.\n\n   Total: |pos-l| + (if l>1 then 1 else 0) + |r-l| + (if r<n then 1 else 0)\n\n But wait, what if we close the right first?\n\n   Step 1: Move to the right to r (if we are at pos, then |pos-r| steps).\n   Step 2: Close the right (if r<n).\n   Then the boundaries become [1, r] and the cursor is at r.\n\n   Step 3: Then we need to close the left [1, l-1]. Now, we are at r, which is >= l (since l<=r). So we move left from r to l (|r-l| steps) and then close the left.\n\n   Total: |pos-r| + (if r<n then 1 else 0) + |r-l| + (if l>1 then 1 else 0)\n\n Alternatively, we might combine the moves: maybe we don't need to go all the way to one end and then the other. \n\n Another idea: we can close the left and right from the same side if we are in between.\n\n Consider: \n   - We must close the left part [1, l-1] and the right part [r+1, n].\n\n   We can do:\n\n   Option C: \n     - If the cursor is already in [l, r], then we can close the left and the right separately.\n\n        Steps:\n          Move to l (from pos): |pos-l| steps.\n          Close the left (if l>1) -> 1 step.\n          Then move to r (from l): |r-l| steps.\n          Close the right (if r<n) -> 1 step.\n\n        Total: |pos-l| + |r-l| + (1 if l>1 else 0) + (1 if r<n else 0)\n\n   But wait, we might be able to do it without moving all the way to l and then to r? \n\n   However, note: to close the left we must be at a tab >= l (so that the left close operation doesn't leave any tab from [l, ...] as being closed). Similarly, to close the right we must be at a tab <= r.\n\n   Therefore, the above sequence is one way.\n\n   Alternatively, we can also:\n\n     Option D: \n        Move to r first (if we are not already at r) and then close the right, then move to l and close the left.\n\n        Steps: |pos-r| + |r-l| + (1 if r<n else 0) + (1 if l>1 else 0)\n\n   So the total time would be the minimum of these two options.\n\n   But note: we might also do:\n\n        Option E: \n          We can close one side and then the other without necessarily going all the way to the opposite end?\n\n        However, the requirement for closing the left is that we must be at a tab i>=l, and for the right we must be at a tab i<=r.\n\n        After closing the left (if we do it first), the left boundary becomes l. Then to close the right we must be at a tab i<=r (which we are, because we were at l and then we moved to r). Similarly for the reverse.\n\n        But wait, what if we are initially outside [l, r]? \n\n        Example: n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4 (as in the example). \n\n        According to the example, the answer is 5.\n\n        Let's compute with our formula:\n\n        Option A (first close left, then right):\n\n          Step 1: Move from 3 to 2: |3-2| = 1\n          Step 2: Close left (since l=2>1, so close left: 1 step) -> now the boundaries are [2,6] (because we closed [1,1])\n          Step 3: Move from 2 to 4: |2-4|=2\n          Step 4: Close right (since r=4<6, so close right: 1 step) -> now boundaries are [2,4]\n\n          Total: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5.\n\n        Option B (first close right, then left):\n\n          Step 1: Move from 3 to 4: |3-4|=1\n          Step 2: Close right (since r=4<6, so close right: 1 step) -> now boundaries [1,4]\n          Step 3: Move from 4 to 2: |4-2|=2\n          Step 4: Close left (since l=2>1, so close left: 1 step) -> now boundaries [2,4]\n\n          Total: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5.\n\n        So both ways give 5.\n\n        But note: we might be able to do:\n\n        Option C: \n\n          What if we close both from the same side? \n\n          Example: Initially at 3.\n\n          Step 1: Move to 2 (left): 1 step.\n          Step 2: Close left: now [2,6] (closed [1,1])\n          Step 3: Now we want to close the right [5,6]. But we are at 2. We have to move to 5 (from 2 to 5: 3 steps) and then close right: 1 step.\n\n          Total: 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 6 -> worse.\n\n          Alternatively, from 3, we could:\n\n          Step 1: Move to 4 (right): 1 step.\n          Step 2: Close right: now [1,4] (closed [5,6])\n          Step 3: Move to 2 (left): from 4 to 2: 2 steps.\n          Step 4: Close left: now [2,4]\n\n          Total: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5.\n\n        So we don't get a better solution.\n\n        However, note that we can also consider:\n\n        Option D: \n\n          We might not need to move to the very ends? \n\n        But the condition for closing left requires that we are at a tab i such that i-1 >= l-1, which is i>=l. Similarly for right, i<=r.\n\n        In fact, we can close the left from any tab i>=l, and similarly for the right.\n\n        Therefore, we don't necessarily have to go to the very edge of the segment, but we must be at least at l to close the left and at most at r to close the right.\n\n        However, note: we have two independent operations. We cannot close the left and the right from the same position if that position is in the middle of [l, r] because the left close operation would close [a, i-1] and the right close operation would close [i+1, b]. But if we are at a tab i in [l, r], then we can close the left and then the right, but we must be at l to close the left (because if we are at a tab i (>=l) and we close the left, then we close [a, i-1] and we require that [1, l-1] is included. Since a is 1, we require i-1 >= l-1 -> i>=l, which is satisfied. Similarly, to close the right we require i<=r.\n\n        But note: we can also close the left from a tab that is greater than l (say, from l+1) and then the right from the same tab (if that tab is <= r) or from a different tab.\n\n        However, we are free to move arbitrarily. The minimal moves for going from one point to another is the absolute difference.\n\n        Therefore, we can break the problem into:\n\n        Let A = (if l > 1) then we need to close the left, which requires moving to a tab >= l (the minimal move is to l) and then close (1 second). Similarly for the right.\n\n        But note: we can do the two closures in any order, and we can combine the movements.\n\n        Actually, we can consider:\n\n        Total moves = (movement to the first closure) + (movement to the second closure) + 2 (if we do two closures) or 1 (if we do one) or 0 (if none).\n\n        However, we must account for the fact that after the first closure, the boundaries change, so the movement for the second closure might be constrained by the updated boundaries.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require that we leave the cursor in a particular place, so we can plan the moves optimally.\n\n        Let me define:\n\n        Let left_required = (l > 1)   [meaning we must close the left part]\n        Let right_required = (r < n)   [meaning we must close the right part]\n\n        Then, we have two independent tasks. We can do them in any order, and we can move the cursor arbitrarily (with the constraint that the boundaries change after each close).\n\n        However, note: the boundaries update only after a close operation. \n\n        Steps for left closure: \n          - We must be at a tab i such that i >= l (in the current boundaries). After closing, the left boundary becomes i (but actually, the left boundary becomes the current cursor's original left boundary? Wait, no: the definition says a and b are the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab. Initially, a=1, b=n. After closing the left, the new a becomes the next tab after the last closed one? Actually, no: the operation \"close all the tabs to the left\" means we remove all tabs from the current minimum (a) to i-1. So after closing, the new a becomes i (because the tabs from a to i-1 are gone, so the smallest remaining tab is i). Similarly, for the right: the new b becomes i.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"close all the tabs to the left of the cursor\", meaning from the current leftmost (a) to i-1. So the new a becomes i.\n\n        So after closing the left, the left boundary becomes the cursor's current position (since we removed everything from a to i-1, so the smallest remaining tab is i). Similarly, after closing the right, the right boundary becomes the cursor's current position.\n\n        This is important because the next move is bounded by the updated boundaries.\n\n        However, we are only concerned with the minimal number of seconds. \n\n        We can consider two strategies:\n\n        Strategy 1: First close the left, then the right.\n\n          Step 1: Move from the initial pos to l (if we are going to close the left). But wait, we don't necessarily have to move to l. We can move to any tab i>=l. However, the minimal movement to get to a tab i>=l is to move to l (because we start at pos, and we want to minimize the distance). \n\n          However, note: we might be able to do less movement if we don't go all the way to l? But the condition is that we must be at a tab i>=l. The minimal distance from pos to a tab >=l is:\n\n            If pos >= l, then we can stay at pos (distance 0) or move to the right? Actually, no: if we are already at a tab >=l, then we can close the left from there. But wait: if we are at a tab i>=l, then we can close the left. However, if we are at a tab i>=l, then the left close operation will remove [a, i-1]. We require that [1, l-1] is contained in [a, i-1]. Since a is initially 1, we require i-1 >= l-1, i.e., i>=l, which holds. So if we are already at a tab >=l, we can close the left without moving.\n\n          Similarly, for the right: if we are at a tab <=r, we can close the right.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal steps for the left closure is:\n\n            Let d_left = 0 if pos >= l, else (l - pos)   [because we must move from pos to at least l]\n\n          Then, we do the left close (1 second). Then the boundaries update: the left boundary becomes the cursor's current tab (which is now at least l). Then we must close the right. For the right closure, we must be at a tab <=r. We are currently at a tab (let's call it i) which is >=l and <=n. Now, we might have to move from i to a tab j<=r.\n\n          The minimal movement for the right closure is:\n\n            We are at i (which is the position after closing the left). But note: we could choose i to be the minimal required (l) to minimize the subsequent movement? \n\n          Actually, we can choose the position for the left closure arbitrarily (any tab from l to the current right boundary). However, we want to minimize the total seconds.\n\n          So we can choose the best i for the left closure: we can choose i=l (because if we choose a tab > l, then we have to move more to get to a tab <=r for the right closure).\n\n          Therefore, for the left closure we move to l (if we weren't there) and then close.\n\n          Then for the right closure, we are at l. Now, we must move to a tab <=r. The minimal movement from l to a tab <=r is 0 if l<=r (which is always true) but we require to be at a tab <=r. Since l<=r, we can stay at l (if l<=r) and then close the right? \n\n          But wait: to close the right, we must be at a tab i such that i<=r. We are at l (which is <=r) so we can close the right from l.\n\n          However, note: the right closure operation from a tab i (which is l) will close the tabs from i+1 to b (the current right boundary). We require that it closes [r+1, n]. But the current right boundary might be n (if we haven't closed the right yet). So we require that the operation closes [r+1, n]. The operation will close from i+1 to b, so we require i+1 <= r+1 and b>=r+1. \n\n          Since i = l (which is <=r) then i+1 <= r+1 (because l<=r => l+1 <= r+1). But note: the operation will close from i+1 to the current right boundary (which is n, unless we did something else). We require that it closes up to n, so we require that the current right boundary is at least r+1 (which it is, because initially it's n). \n\n          However, the operation will close from i+1 to b. We require that [r+1, n] is contained in [i+1, b]. Since i = l and l<=r, then i+1 = l+1, which might be less than r+1. So if l+1 <= r, then the operation will close from l+1 to b, which includes [r+1, n] only if l+1 <= r+1, which is true, but also we require that the operation doesn't leave any tab above r? Actually, the operation will close everything from i+1 to the current right boundary. We want to close [r+1, n] but we don't want to close [l+1, r] (because they are part of the desired segment). \n\n          This is a problem! \n\n          Correction: The operation \"close all the tabs to the right\" closes from [i+1, b]. We must ensure that we don't close any tab that should remain. Therefore, we must be at a tab i such that i+1 > r. Because then the operation [i+1, b] will be [i+1, b] and if i+1>r, then it doesn't close any desired tab.\n\n          Similarly, for the left close: we must be at a tab i such that i < l. Why? Because the left close operation closes [a, i-1]. We require that [1, l-1] is contained in [a, i-1] and that we don't close any desired tab. The desired tabs start at l. So we require i-1 < l. Then the operation will close [a, i-1] and i-1 < l, so we don't close any desired tab.\n\n          Therefore, the conditions are:\n\n          - To close the left part (tabs [1, l-1]), we must be at a tab i such that i-1 < l. This means i <= l. But wait, if i < l, then we are not covering [1, l-1]? Actually, the condition is that the operation closes [a, i-1] and we require that [1, l-1] is contained in [a, i-1]. Since a=1 initially, we require i-1 >= l-1, i.e., i>=l. \n\n          There is a contradiction: \n\n          We want to close [1, l-1] and we don't want to close [l, ...]. \n\n          Operation: close left from tab i: closes [a, i-1]. \n\n          We require that [1, l-1] is contained in [a, i-1] and [l, ...] is not contained in [a, i-1] (at least not the desired part). \n\n          The desired part starts at l. We require that l is not in [a, i-1]. So l must be > i-1, i.e., i < l+1, so i <= l.\n\n          But also, [1, l-1] must be contained in [a, i-1]. Since a=1, we require i-1 >= l-1, so i>=l.\n\n          Therefore, i must be exactly l. \n\n          Similarly, for the right: we must be at a tab i such that i+1 > r, i.e., i >= r+1 (if we are to not close the desired part). But wait, we require that the operation [i+1, b] does not include [l, r]. We require that i+1 > r, so that the operation starts at r+1 or beyond. \n\n          However, note: the operation closes from i+1 to the current right boundary. We want to close [r+1, n] and not close [l, r]. The condition is that i+1 > r. Then the operation will start at i+1 which is > r, so it doesn't close any desired tab.\n\n          But wait, what if we are at i = r? Then i+1 = r+1, which is the beginning of the unwanted segment. Then the operation will close [r+1, n] and that's acceptable. \n\n          Actually, the condition for the right close is that we must be at a tab i such that i >= r (so that i+1 >= r+1, and then we close from r+1 to the current boundary). \n\n          However, let me re-read the problem: \n            \"close all the tabs to the right of the cursor\" -> closes [i+1, b]\n\n          We want to close [r+1, n] and we don't want to close [l, r]. We require that the operation doesn't close any tab in [l, r]. The operation closes [i+1, b]. We require that [i+1, b] and [l, r] have no overlap. \n\n          We require that i+1 > r. Then [i+1, b] starts at r+1, so no overlap. \n\n          But note: we can also be at i = r, then i+1 = r+1, which is acceptable. \n\n          Actually, the condition is: i+1 > r  OR we can have i+1 <= r? No, because if i+1 <= r, then the operation would close from i+1 to b, which would include some of the desired segment [l, r] (if i+1 <= r). \n\n          Therefore, we must have i+1 > r, i.e., i >= r+1? \n\n          But wait, if i = r, then i+1 = r+1, which is > r, so that's okay. \n\n          Actually, i+1 > r is equivalent to i >= r+1? \n\n          Let me check: \n            i = r: then i+1 = r+1, which is > r -> yes.\n            i = r-1: then i+1 = r, which is not > r -> so we cannot use i=r-1.\n\n          Therefore, for the right close, we must be at a tab i such that i >= r (so that i+1 >= r+1). \n\n          Similarly, for the left close: we must be at a tab i such that i <= l (so that i-1 <= l-1) and also [1, l-1] is contained in [a, i-1]. \n\n          Condition for left close: [1, l-1] ⊆ [a, i-1]. \n            a is the current left boundary. Initially a=1, but after some operations it might change.\n\n          However, note: we are going to close the left part first. Initially a=1. We require that [1, l-1] ⊆ [1, i-1] -> so i-1 must be at least l-1, i.e., i>=l. \n\n          But wait, we also require that we don't close any desired tab. The desired tabs start at l. We require that l is not in [a, i-1]. Since [a, i-1] is [1, i-1], we require that l is not in [1, i-1], i.e., l > i-1, so i < l+1 -> i<=l.\n\n          Therefore, i must be l (exactly).\n\n          Similarly, for the right close: we must be at i>=r (exactly) to not close any desired tab.\n\n        Therefore, the procedure is:\n\n          To close the left part, we must be at l (if we haven't closed the left part already) and the operation will close [1, l-1] (provided that we are at l and the current left boundary is 1, which it is initially).\n\n          To close the right part, we must be at r (if we haven't closed the right part already) and the operation will close [r+1, n] (provided that the current right boundary is n, which it is initially).\n\n        However, note: after closing the left part, the left boundary becomes l. Then if we want to close the right part, we must be at a tab i>=r (and the current right boundary is still n). \n\n        But wait, what if we are at l (after closing the left) and we want to close the right part? We must move from l to r (if l<=r, which is true) and then close. \n\n        Similarly, if we first close the right, we must be at r, then move to l and close the left.\n\n        So the two strategies:\n\n        Strategy 1 (close left first):\n          Step 1: Move from initial pos to l (if we are not already at l). Cost: |pos - l|\n          Step 2: Close left (if l>1). Cost: 1\n          Step 3: Move from l to r (if we are not already at r). Cost: |l - r|\n          Step 4: Close right (if r<n). Cost: 1\n\n          Total = |pos-l| + (1 if l>1 else 0) + |l-r| + (1 if r<n else 0)\n\n        Strategy 2 (close right first):\n          Step 1: Move from initial pos to r. Cost: |pos - r|\n          Step 2: Close right (if r<n). Cost: 1\n          Step 3: Move from r to l. Cost: |r-l|\n          Step 4: Close left (if l>1). Cost: 1\n\n          Total = |pos-r| + (1 if r<n else 0) + |r-l| + (1 if l>1 else 0)\n\n        Now, note that |l-r| = |r-l|, so the two strategies are:\n\n          Strategy 1: |pos-l| + |l-r| + ( (1 if l>1 else 0) + (1 if r<n else 0) )\n          Strategy 2: |pos-r| + |r-l| + ( (1 if r<n else 0) + (1 if l>1 else 0) )\n\n        And since |l-r| = |r-l|, we can write:\n\n          Strategy 1: |pos-l| + |l-r| + (left_close_needed + right_close_needed)\n          Strategy 2: |pos-r| + |l-r| + (left_close_needed + right_close_needed)\n\n        Where left_close_needed = 1 if l>1 else 0\n        right_close_needed = 1 if r<n else 0\n\n        Then the answer is the minimum of these two strategies.\n\n        But wait, what if we can do the two closures without moving the cursor to both l and r? \n\n        Actually, if we are initially in [l, r], then we can:\n\n          Option 3: \n            If we are already at a tab i that satisfies both conditions for closing the left and the right (i.e., i>=l and i<=r) then we can do:\n\n            Step 1: Close left (if l>1) -> then the boundaries become [i, n] (but note: we must be at i>=l, but we are at i and we are going to close the left from i: then the left close operation requires that we are at i<=l (from the condition above) and also i>=l. So i must be l. Similarly, for the right we must be at r.\n\n            Actually, we cannot close both from the same tab i if i is not both l and r (unless l==r). \n\n            But note: the conditions for the left close require i<=l and i>=l -> i=l. Similarly for the right: i>=r and i<=r -> i=r.\n\n            So if we are not at l or r, we cannot close both from the same position.\n\n            However, if we are at a tab i in [l, r] and we want to close both, we must move to l for the left and then to r for the right? Or vice versa.\n\n            But note: after closing the left, the left boundary changes. Then the condition for the right close is still that we must be at a tab i>=r (so we have to be at r). So we have to move to r anyway.\n\n            Similarly, if we close the right first, we have to move to l.\n\n        Therefore, the above two strategies cover all possibilities.\n\n        However, note: what if we don't need to close one side? \n\n        Example: if l==1, then we don't need to close the left. Similarly, if r==n, we don't need to close the right.\n\n        Then the strategies become:\n\n          Strategy 1 (if we need to close the left and/or right):\n            If we need to close the left (l>1) and the right (r<n):\n              min( |pos-l| + |l-r| + 2, |pos-r| + |l-r| + 2 )\n\n            If we only need to close the left (l>1 and r==n):\n              min( |pos-l| + (1 if l>1 else 0), ... ) -> but wait, we don't need to close the right, so we only do:\n\n                Option: move to l (if necessary) and close left.\n\n                Steps: |pos-l| + 1\n\n            Similarly, if we only need to close the right (r<n and l==1):\n                Steps: |pos-r| + 1\n\n            If we don't need to close any (l==1 and r==n):\n                Steps: 0\n\n        But note: in the case where we don't need to close one side, we don't need to move to that side's boundary. \n\n        Actually, the two strategies we defined above assume that we do two closures. But if one closure is not needed, then we only do one.\n\n        We can handle it by:\n\n          total_seconds = 0\n\n          If l > 1: \n            # We must close the left. We must be at l (if we haven't closed the right first and then moved? Actually, we can also consider the order if both are present, but if one is absent then we don't have to go to the opposite side.\n\n          Actually, we can combine:\n\n          We have two independent closures. We can do:\n\n          Option 1: Only close left (if needed)\n            Steps: \n              If we are not at l, move to l (|pos-l|) and then close (1). But if we are already at a tab >=l, then we don't need to move to l? \n\n          But wait, the condition for the left close is that we must be at l (exactly). \n\n          Actually, the condition for the left close is that we must be at a tab i such that i>=l and i<=l (from the above reasoning). \n\n          Similarly, for the right close: must be at r.\n\n          Therefore, if we only need to close the left, we must be at l. \n\n          So the steps for only closing the left is: \n            If we are not at l, we move from pos to l (|pos-l|) and then close (1).\n\n          Similarly, for only closing the right: \n            If we are not at r, we move from pos to r (|pos-r|) and then close (1).\n\n          Now, if both are needed, we have two choices:\n\n            Option A: \n              Move to l (if not there), close left, then move to r (if not there) and close right.\n\n              Steps: |pos-l| + 1 + |l-r| + 1\n\n            Option B:\n              Move to r (if not there), close right, then move to l (if not there) and close left.\n\n              Steps: |pos-r| + 1 + |r-l| + 1\n\n          But note: if we are already at l (for Option A) then we don't need to move to l, but then we must move from l to r (if we haven't been at r). Similarly, if we are already at r (for Option B) then we don't need to move to r, but then we must move from r to l.\n\n          However, we can also consider a mixed strategy: \n\n          Option C: \n            Move to a common point? Actually, the two closures require being at l and at r. We must be at l to close the left and at r to close the right.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal steps for both is:\n\n            We can choose the order:\n\n            Case 1: Go to l first, then to r.\n              Steps: |pos-l| + |l-r| + 2\n\n            Case 2: Go to r first, then to l.\n              Steps: |pos-r| + |l-r| + 2\n\n          Then take the minimum.\n\n        Now, what if we don't need to close one side? \n\n          Example: only left is needed (l>1, r==n)\n\n            Then we must be at l. Steps: |pos-l| + 1\n\n          Example: only right is needed (r<n, l==1)\n\n            Steps: |pos-r| + 1\n\n          Example: none needed (l==1 and r==n)\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] in her browser. The browser starts with n tabs, and the cursor is initially at position pos. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right (each move takes 1 second) or closing all tabs to the left or right of the cursor (each close operation takes 1 second). The challenge is to find the optimal sequence of operations to minimize the total time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to leave only the tabs from l to r inclusive. This involves closing two segments: tabs before l (if any) and tabs after r (if any). The key observation is that to close the left segment, the cursor must be exactly at l, and to close the right segment, the cursor must be exactly at r. \n\n2. **Intuition**: \n   - If no tabs need to be closed (i.e., l == 1 and r == n), the answer is 0.\n   - If only the left segment needs closing (l > 1 and r == n), move the cursor to l (if not already there) and perform the close operation.\n   - If only the right segment needs closing (r < n and l == 1), move the cursor to r (if not already there) and perform the close operation.\n   - If both segments need closing, consider two strategies:\n     - Move to l first, then to r, performing close operations at each step.\n     - Move to r first, then to l, performing close operations at each step.\n   The minimal time is the lesser of these two strategies.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves checking the conditions for closing left and right segments and calculating the minimal steps required based on the initial cursor position and the segment boundaries.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves simple arithmetic operations and comparisons, resulting in a constant time complexity O(1), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    left_needed = (l > 1)\n    right_needed = (r < n)\n    \n    if not left_needed and not right_needed:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    if left_needed and not right_needed:\n        moves = abs(pos - l)\n        total_seconds = moves + 1\n        print(total_seconds)\n        return\n        \n    if right_needed and not left_needed:\n        moves = abs(pos - r)\n        total_seconds = moves + 1\n        print(total_seconds)\n        return\n        \n    option1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2\n    option2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2\n    total_seconds = min(option1, option2)\n    print(total_seconds)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initial Check**: If the entire range of tabs (1 to n) is already within [l, r], no operations are needed, so the answer is 0.\n- **Left Segment Check**: If only tabs before l need closing, move the cursor to l (if not already there) and close them. The time taken is the distance from the initial position to l plus 1 second for the close operation.\n- **Right Segment Check**: Similarly, if only tabs after r need closing, move the cursor to r (if not already there) and close them. The time taken is the distance from the initial position to r plus 1 second for the close operation.\n- **Both Segments Needed**: Calculate the time for two strategies—moving to l first then r, or moving to r first then l. The minimal time between these two strategies is the answer. Each strategy includes the movement time and two close operations (one for each segment). \n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures the minimal time is found by leveraging simple arithmetic and conditional checks.",
