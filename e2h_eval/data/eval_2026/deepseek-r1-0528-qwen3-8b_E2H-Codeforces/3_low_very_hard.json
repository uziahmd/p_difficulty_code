Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering the gaps between lanterns and the ends.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the list of lantern positions.\n 2. The entire street must be covered from 0 to l.\n 3. Consider two parts: \n    a) The left end (from 0 to the first lantern)\n    b) The gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n    c) The right end (from the last lantern to l)\n\n 4. For the left end: we need to cover from 0 to the first lantern at position a0.\n    The required d for the left end is at least a0 / 2.0.\n\n 5. For the gaps between two consecutive lanterns (say, between a[i] and a[i+1]):\n    The gap is (a[i+1] - a[i]). To cover this gap, the two lanterns must have their light overlap or meet.\n    The required d for this gap is (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.0.\n\n 6. For the right end: we need to cover from the last lantern (at position a[-1]) to l.\n    The required d for the right end is (l - a[-1]) / 2.0.\n\n 7. However, note that the lanterns can cover beyond their own positions. We are to find the minimum d such that the entire street is lit.\n\n 8. Actually, we can think of the entire street being covered if the maximum of the following is sufficient:\n    - The left gap: d >= (a[0] - 0) / 2.0? Actually, the first lantern must cover from 0 to a[0]. So d must be at least (a[0])/2. But wait: if d is at least a0, then the first lantern covers [0, a0+d] which must include 0. Actually, the condition for the left end is: the leftmost point 0 must be within d of the first lantern, i.e., a0 <= d + 0 => d >= a0. However, wait: the lantern at a0 lights from (a0-d) to (a0+d). So to cover 0, we require a0-d <= 0 <= a0+d -> but since 0 is to the left, we only need 0 <= a0+d. Since a0>=0, the critical part is that the left edge 0 is covered by the first lantern: so we require d >= a0 (if we consider only the first lantern) but wait, actually we can use multiple lanterns. However, the problem is that we are looking for the minimum d such that the entire street is lit.\n\n 9. Actually, we can break down the street coverage:\n\n    The entire street is covered if:\n      - The first lantern covers from 0 to a0 + d. But we also have other lanterns. However, we can compute the minimal d by considering the gaps.\n\n    Alternatively, we can think:\n\n    Let the current coverage start at 0. Then, for each lantern, we extend the coverage to the right by d (so the coverage becomes max(current_coverage, lantern_position - d, lantern_position + d))? \n\n    But note: we want the minimal d such that the entire street is covered.\n\n 10. Another approach: the answer d must be at least half the maximum gap from the start to the first lantern, between lanterns, and from the last lantern to the end.\n\n    Specifically, we can consider:\n\n    candidate1 = a[0] / 2.0   [to cover from 0 to a[0]]\n    candidate2 = (l - a[-1]) / 2.0   [to cover from a[-1] to l]\n\n    candidate3 = for each i from 0 to n-2: (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.0\n\n    Then the answer is the maximum of these candidates.\n\n    Why? Because:\n\n    - To cover the beginning: the first lantern must extend at least half its distance to the left (but we don't have a lantern to the left, so d must be at least a0/2).\n    - Similarly, for the end, the last lantern must extend at least (l - a[-1])/2 to the right.\n    - For two consecutive lanterns at a[i] and a[i+1], the gap between them is (a[i+1] - a[i]). The two lanterns must together cover this gap. The best way is to have each lantern cover half the gap, so the required d for both is at least (gap)/2.\n\n    However, note that if the gap is covered by having one lantern extend more than half, that's allowed, but then we don't need the other half from the next lantern. But the minimal d is",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` required for all lanterns to illuminate the entire street from point `0` to point `l`. The solution involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the ends of the street to find the smallest `d` that ensures complete coverage.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The street is a straight line from `0` to `l`, with `n` lanterns positioned at various points. Each lantern lights all points within a distance `d` of its position. The goal is to find the smallest `d` such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern.\n2. **Key Insight**: The minimal `d` must cover:\n   - The gap from the start of the street (`0`) to the first lantern.\n   - The gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n   - The gap from the last lantern to the end of the street (`l`).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting**: First, sort the lantern positions to easily compute the gaps between them.\n   - **Gap Calculation**: For each segment (start to first lantern, between consecutive lanterns, and last lantern to end), compute the required `d` to cover the segment. The maximum of these values will be the answer.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the lantern positions takes O(n log n) time, where `n` is the number of lanterns. The subsequent gap calculations are linear, O(n), making the overall complexity O(n log n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 1000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = float(data[1])\n    lanterns = list(map(float, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    lanterns.sort()\n    \n    gaps = []\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(l / 2.0))\n        return\n        \n    gaps.append(lanterns[0] / 2.0)\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = lanterns[i] - lanterns[i-1]\n        gaps.append(gap / 2.0)\n        \n    gaps.append((l - lanterns[-1]) / 2.0)\n    \n    d = max(gaps)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns `n`, the street length `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to process them in ascending order, which simplifies gap calculation.\n3. **Edge Handling**: If there are no lanterns, the minimal `d` is simply half the street length since the entire street must be covered by a single lantern's light.\n4. **Gap Calculation**:\n   - **Left Gap**: The distance from the start of the street (`0`) to the first lantern divided by 2.\n   - **Consecutive Gaps**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the distance between them divided by 2.\n   - **Right Gap**: The distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (`l`) divided by 2.\n5. **Result Determination**: The maximum value among all calculated gaps is the minimal `d` needed to cover the entire street. This value is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that all parts of the street are illuminated by leveraging sorted positions and calculating critical gaps, providing an optimal solution with minimal computational overhead.",
