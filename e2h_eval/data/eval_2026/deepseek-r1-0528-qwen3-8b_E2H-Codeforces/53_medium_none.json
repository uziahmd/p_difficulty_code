    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a more straightforward method.\n We are to find the longest substring that appears at least twice (and they can overlap).\n\n Approach:\n Since the string length is small (<=100), we can consider checking all possible substrings and record their occurrences.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input string.\n 2. We'll consider all possible substrings (by starting index and length) and store the substring and its starting indices.\n    However, we don't need to store all, but we can use a dictionary to map substring to the list of starting indices (or just count if we only care about at least two).\n 3. Alternatively, we can iterate over all substring lengths from the maximum possible (which is n//2? actually, note: the substring must appear at least twice, so the maximum length we can have is floor(n/2) if they are non-overlapping? But note: they can overlap. Actually, the maximum length for two occurrences can be up to n-1 (if the entire string is repeated, then we can have two overlapping occurrences). But wait, if the entire string is repeated, then we would have two occurrences: one starting at 0 and one starting at 1? Actually, the problem says \"at least twice\", and occurrences can overlap.\n\n However, note: the two occurrences must be distinct in terms of starting index. The same substring can appear many times.\n\n Example: \n   Input: 'ababa' -> output 3 because 'aba' appears starting at 0 and 2, and also 'bab' at 1 and 3, but the longest is 3.\n\n How about: \n   We can try from the maximum possible substring length (which is the entire string) down to 1, and check if there exists a substring of that length that appears at least twice.\n\n But note: the two occurrences can be overlapping. So the condition for a substring s (of length L) to appear at least twice is that there exist two indices i and j (i < j) such that the substring starting at i of length L equals the substring starting at j of length L.\n\n However, the problem asks for the longest substring (by length) that appears at least twice.\n\n Alternate approach:\n   We can use a dictionary to record every substring and the starting indices (or just the frequency). But since the string is small, we can do:\n\n   Let n = len(s)\n   For L in range(n, 0, -1):   # L is the length of substring, from longest to shortest\n        We can check for each starting index i from 0 to n-L:\n            substring = s[i:i+L]\n            Then check if this substring appears again somewhere else (i.e., starting at j>=i+1 and j+L<=n)\n\n   But note: we don't need to check every substring if we break early. However, worst-case the string is of length 100, so the total number of substrings is about 100*100/2 = 5000, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, we want the longest, so we start from the maximum L (which is n) and go down until we find one substring that appears at least twice.\n\n   But wait: what if the entire string appears twice? That means the string is periodic? Actually, if the entire string appears twice, then the string must be of length 0 or more, but for example, \"aaa\": \n        Entire string \"aaa\" appears only once? Actually, no: we are looking for two distinct occurrences (with different starting indices). So for \"aaa\", the substring \"aaa\" (length=3) appears only once (starting at 0). But wait, we can have overlapping? The problem says occurrences can overlap. So in \"aaa\", the substring \"aaa\" of length 3 appears only once (because the next occurrence would require starting at index 1, but then we only have two characters left). So we are considering contiguous substring of fixed length.\n\n   Actually, the two occurrences must be two distinct contiguous substrings (so the starting indices are different). They can overlap, but the substring of length L must appear at two different places.\n\n   Example: \"aaa\" has substrings of length 1: 'a' appears at [0,1,2] -> at least twice -> so answer would be 1? But wait, the example input ['zzz'] outputs 2. \n\n   Let me read the example again: \n        Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n        Output: ['0', '3', '2']\n\n   Explanation for 'zzz': \n        Substrings of length 1: 'z' appears three times -> valid, but we are looking for the longest.\n        Substrings of length 2: 'zz' appears twice (at index0 and index1) -> valid, so the answer is 2.\n\n   So the algorithm:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n\n        # If the string length is 1, then we cannot have two same substrings (unless the same substring appears twice, but with length 1 and two occurrences: but two occurrences must be two distinct indices, and in a string of length 1, we have only one index) -> so answer 0.\n\n        We'll iterate L from min(n, ?) down to 1. Actually, the maximum length we can have for a substring that appears at least twice is floor(n/2) ? Not exactly: consider \"aaa\", n=3, then the substring \"a\" (length 1) and \"aa\" (length 2) would be the candidates. But note: the substring \"aa\" (length 2) in \"aaa\": \n            Occurrences: \n                starting at 0: \"aa\"\n                starting at 1: \"aa\"\n            So indeed, \"aa\" appears twice. So maximum L for \"aaa\" is 2.\n\n        However, the condition for two occurrences: the second occurrence must start at an index <= n-L. So for a substring of length L, the last occurrence starts at n-L. So we need at least two indices i and j (with i < j) such that j <= n-L and s[i:i+L] == s[j:j+L].\n\n        We can do:\n\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            seen = {}\n            # We'll traverse the string with start index from 0 to n-L\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                # If we have seen this substring already in a previous part of the string (but note: we are going from left to right, so we can check if we've seen it and the next occurrence is not necessarily the next one? Actually, we just need two occurrences. But if we see the same substring again, then we have two.\n\n                However, we must be cautious: we might see the same substring multiple times, but we don't want to use the same occurrence twice.\n\n            But wait, we are traversing from left to right. We can record the first occurrence and then if we see the same substring again, then we have two.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a set for each L? But we want to break as soon as we find one substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n        We can do:\n\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            found = False\n            # We'll use a dictionary to record the substring and the last index we saw it? Actually, we don't need the exact indices, just whether we have seen the substring at least twice.\n\n            # But note: we are traversing from left to right. We can do:\n\n            # Option 1: for each L, we can record the substrings and their counts. But we don't need the count beyond 2.\n\n            # However, we can break early: if we find one substring that appears at least twice, then we output L and break.\n\n            # But note: we are going from large L to small, so we want the largest L.\n\n            # We can do:\n\n            # Create a set for the current L? But we need to remember the substrings we've seen so far.\n\n            seen_substrings = set()\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen_substrings:\n                    # Then we have found a duplicate for this L\n                    print(L)\n                    exit(0)   # Or break out and then return L.\n                else:\n                    seen_substrings.add(substr)\n\n            # If we finish the inner loop without finding a duplicate, then we continue to smaller L.\n\n        However, wait: what if the same substring appears more than two times? Then the above will still work because once we see it the second time, we break.\n\n        But note: we are adding the substring the first time we see it, and then when we see it again we break.\n\n        But consider: \n            s = \"ababa\", n=5\n            We are trying L=5: \n                substrings: \"ababa\" -> set initially empty -> add \"ababa\"\n                then no duplicates -> move to L=4: \n                    \"abab\", \"baba\" -> no duplicates.\n                L=3: \n                    i=0: \"aba\" -> add\n                    i=1: \"bab\" -> add\n                    i=2: \"aba\" -> found duplicate -> output 3.\n\n            This matches.\n\n        However, what if the duplicate substring is not the first one encountered? For example, if we have \"aabaac\", and we are looking for L=3:\n            i0: \"aab\" -> add\n            i1: \"aba\" -> add\n            i2: \"baa\" -> add\n            i3: \"aac\" -> add -> no duplicate.\n\n            But wait, the substring \"aa\" is of length 2, which we haven't checked. But we are checking L=3 first. \n\n        This is correct because we are going from the maximum L (which is 6) down to 1. We are only concerned with the longest.\n\n        However, consider: \n            s = \"abcdeabcde\" (n=10)\n            We want to find the longest substring that appears at least twice. The entire string doesn't, but \"abcde\" appears twice? Actually, the substring \"abcde\" appears at index0 and index5. So for L=5, we should find a duplicate.\n\n            i0: \"abcde\" -> add\n            i1: \"bcdea\" -> add\n            i2: \"cdeab\" -> add\n            i3: \"deabc\" -> add\n            i4: \"eabcd\" -> add\n            i5: \"abcde\" -> duplicate -> output 5.\n\n        But wait, the example input: \n            Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] -> outputs [0,3,2]\n\n        What about \"abcd\"? \n            n=4, so we check L=4: \"abcd\" -> no duplicate.\n            L=3: \n                \"abc\", \"bcd\" -> no duplicate.\n            L=2:\n                \"ab\", \"bc\", \"cd\" -> no duplicate.\n            L=1:\n                \"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\" -> no duplicate.\n\n            So we output 0.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        But wait: what if the same substring appears in a non-contiguous way? Actually, we are checking contiguous substrings. The problem is about contiguous substrings.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not specify that the two occurrences must be contiguous? Actually, the substring is defined by contiguous letters.\n\n        But the above algorithm for a given L checks every contiguous substring of length L and uses a set to see if we've seen the same substring before. But note: we are traversing from left to right, so we might see the same substring again later. However, if we see the same substring at two different starting indices, then we break.\n\n        But wait: what if the same substring appears in two non-overlapping parts, but we haven't seen it in the set? Actually, we are storing every substring we've seen so far, and if we see the same substring again, then we break.\n\n        However, there is a catch: what if the same substring appears three times? Then we break at the second occurrence.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"at least twice\", so two is enough.\n\n        However, there is an issue: the set for each L is built from left to right. But when we are at a later starting index, we might see a substring that was seen earlier. But that's okay.\n\n        But consider: \n            s = \"aabaa\", n=5\n            We are checking L=3:\n                i0: \"aab\" -> add to set\n                i1: \"aba\" -> add\n                i2: \"baa\" -> add\n                i3: \"aaa\" -> add -> no duplicate.\n\n            However, the substring \"aaa\" is new, but wait: is there a duplicate for L=3? \n                The substring \"aab\" appears at i0, and then we have \"aba\", \"baa\", \"aaa\". No duplicate.\n\n            But wait, the substring \"aa\" (L=2) is duplicated? \n                We are not checking L=2 yet because we are going from high to low. But we are checking L=3 first and didn't find, then L=2.\n\n            For L=2:\n                i0: \"aa\" -> add\n                i1: \"ab\" -> add\n                i2: \"ba\" -> add\n                i3: \"aa\" -> found duplicate -> output 2.\n\n            So the answer is 2.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        However, note: the above algorithm does not consider that the two occurrences must be distinct. But by using a set and checking for the same substring appearing again, we are ensuring distinct occurrences (since we are moving forward, and we haven't seen the same substring at a different position).\n\n        But wait: what if the same substring appears twice, but the two occurrences are the same contiguous block? That is, if the string is \"aaaa\", then for L=3:\n            i0: \"aaa\" -> add\n            i1: \"aaa\" -> duplicate -> output 3.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        But note: the set for a given L is built from left to right. We are not storing the starting index, so if the same substring appears again, we break.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: we are storing the substring and then checking if we have seen it. But what if the same substring appears twice, but the two occurrences are separated by other substrings? The set doesn't care.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n        Steps:\n          s = input().strip()\n          n = len(s)\n\n          # If n==0, then output 0, but guaranteed non-empty.\n\n          # We'll iterate L from n down to 1:\n          for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n              seen = set()\n              found = False\n              for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                  substr = s[i:i+L]\n                  if substr in seen:\n                      print(L)\n                      exit(0)\n                  else:\n                      seen.add(substr)\n\n          # If we finish the loop without finding any, then we output 0.\n\n          print(0)\n\n        But wait: the above code for \"abcd\" would output 0, which is correct.\n\n        However, let's test with \"aaa\": \n            n=3\n            L=3: \n                i0: \"aaa\" -> add to seen\n                i1: \"aa\" (but wait, for L=3, i1: substring is s[1:4] -> but 4 is beyond the string? Actually, the substring for i1 and L=3 is s[1:4] which is \"aa\" (only two characters) -> wait, no: \n                Correction: the inner loop for L=3: \n                    i from 0 to n-L (inclusive) -> n=3, L=3 -> i from 0 to 0 (because n-L+1 = 1). So only i=0.\n\n                Then L=2:\n                    i from 0 to 3-2=1 -> i=0 and i=1.\n                    i0: \"aa\" -> add\n                    i1: \"a\" (actually, wait: substring of length 2 from index1: s[1:3] is \"aa\")\n                    So when i=0: \"aa\" -> add\n                    i=1: \"aa\" -> found duplicate -> output 2.\n\n            Correct.\n\n        But wait, the substring for i=1 and L=2 in \"aaa\" (n=3) is s[1:3] which is \"aa\", and we have already seen \"aa\" at i=0. So it works.\n\n        However, note: the substring extraction in Python is [start:start+L] and it is safe (if start+L exceeds the string, then it returns the available part). But in our inner loop, i goes from 0 to n-L (inclusive) so that start+L is at most n.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        # If the string is of length 0, but guaranteed non-empty.\n\n        # We are going from the maximum substring length (n) down to 1.\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            # We'll consider all starting indices from 0 to n-L\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    exit(0)\n                seen.add(substr)\n\n        print(0)\n\n        Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \"abcd\" -> outputs 0.\n        Example 2: \"ababa\" -> outputs 3.\n        Example 3: \"zzz\" -> outputs 2.\n\n        Another example: \"a\" -> outputs 0.\n\n        Example: \"aa\" -> \n            n=2\n            L=2: \n                i0: \"aa\" -> add, then no more i (because n-L+1 = 1, so only i0) -> no duplicate for L=2.\n            L=1:\n                i0: \"a\" -> add\n                i1: \"a\" -> duplicate -> output 1.\n\n        But wait, the example input does not include \"aa\", but according to the problem, the two occurrences can overlap. In \"aa\", the two occurrences of \"a\" are at index0 and index1, and they are adjacent and overlapping? Actually, the substring \"a\" is of length 1, so they are adjacent and overlapping.\n\n        However, the problem says \"longest substring\". In \"aa\", the substring \"aa\" (length2) did not appear twice (only once), so the next candidate is \"a\" (length1) which appeared twice. So output 1.\n\n        But wait, the example input \"zzz\" (which is like \"aaa\") outputs 2, not 3. Why? Because in \"zzz\":\n            For L=3: substring \"zzz\" appears only once (at index0) because the next occurrence would require starting at index1, but then we have only two characters. So for L=3, we only have one occurrence.\n            For L=2: we have two occurrences: at index0 and index1.\n\n        So the algorithm is correct.\n\n        However, note: the above code uses `exit(0)` which terminates the program. We can also break out and then print the result.\n\n        But we are reading from stdin and writing to stdout.\n\n        Since the problem is small, we can do:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n\n        # Edge: if n==0, then output 0.\n\n        # We are going to check from L=n down to 1.\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    exit(0)\n                seen.add(substr)\n\n        print(0)\n\n        But note: we are using exit(0) which is a bit abrupt. Alternatively, we can use a flag.\n\n        However, the problem guarantees the input is non-empty, so we don't have to worry about empty string.\n\n        Let me write without exit(0):\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n\n        ans = 0\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            duplicate_found = False\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    ans = L\n                    duplicate_found = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if duplicate_found:\n                break\n\n        print(ans)\n\n        But wait, what if we break the inner loop, then we break the outer loop and output the L. This is the same as before.\n\n        However, we must initialize ans to 0, and then if we break, we output the L. But if we don't break, then we output 0.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        max_dup_length = 0\n\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            # Check for duplicate substring of length L\n            seen = set()\n            found = False\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if found:\n                max_dup_length = L\n                break\n\n        print(max_dup_length)\n\n        But wait, what if we break at L=3, then we set max_dup_length=3 and break, then output 3. But if we don't break, then we continue to L=2 and then set max_dup_length=2 and break, then output 2. Actually, we break at the first L (from largest) that has a duplicate.\n\n        However, the above code does not set max_dup_length for the first duplicate found and then breaks. But we are iterating from largest to smallest, so the first duplicate we find is the longest.\n\n        But note: we break the inner loop as soon as we find one duplicate, and then we break the outer loop. This is correct.\n\n        However, we can optimize: we are building a set for each L from n down to 1 until we find a duplicate. But worst-case, the string has no duplicate substring (like \"abcd\") then we do:\n\n            L=n: build a set of 1 element -> no duplicate.\n            L=n-1: build a set of 2 elements -> no duplicate.\n            ... until L=1: build a set of n elements -> no duplicate.\n\n        The total operations would be about O(n^2) in the worst-case, but n<=100, so the worst-case total substrings is about 5000, which is acceptable.\n\n        Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n        But note: the above code sets max_dup_length = L and breaks, so we output the first L (largest) that has a duplicate.\n\n        However, we must consider: what if there are two different substrings of the same maximum length? Actually, we break at the first one we find. But the problem asks for the length, not the substring.\n\n        Example: \"ababab\" \n            We are checking L=6: \"ababab\" -> no duplicate (only one occurrence)\n            L=5: \"ababa\", \"batab\" (wait, let me write: \n                s = \"ababab\", n=6\n                L=5: \n                    i0: \"ababa\"\n                    i1: \"babab\"\n                    no duplicate -> move to L=4\n                L=4:\n                    i0: \"abab\"\n                    i1: \"baba\"\n                    i2: \"abab\" -> duplicate -> output 4.\n\n            But wait, the substring \"abab\" appears at index0 and index2. So the length is 4.\n\n        However, note: there is also \"baba\" (length4) that appears only once? Actually, no, because we break at the first duplicate we find. And we are scanning from left to right, so we see \"abab\" at i0 and then at i2.\n\n        But what if we change the order? Actually, the set does not depend on order. We are adding as we go.\n\n        But note: we break the inner loop as soon as we find a duplicate. So we are not checking all substrings of length L, but we break at the first duplicate.\n\n        This is efficient.\n\n        However, what if the duplicate substring is not the first one we meet in the scan? Actually, we are storing all the substrings we've seen so far. So if we see a substring that was seen before (regardless of where) then we break.\n\n        Example: \"ababab\", L=4:\n            i0: \"abab\" -> add to set\n            i1: \"baba\" -> add\n            i2: \"abab\" -> found in set -> break.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        But wait: the substring \"abab\" is stored at i0, then at i2 we see it again.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        # If n==0, but guaranteed non-empty.\n\n        # We are going from L = n down to 1\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    exit(0)\n                seen.add(substr)\n        print(0)\n\n        But we can avoid using exit(0) by breaking and then printing after.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        # If n==0, then output 0, but guaranteed non-empty.\n\n        # We are going from L = n down to 1\n        ans = 0\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    ans = L\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if ans != 0:\n                break\n\n        print(ans)\n\n        But wait, if we break the inner loop, we break the outer loop. This is the same.\n\n        However, let me test with the examples.\n\n        Example 1: \"abcd\" -> no duplicate found, so ans remains 0, then print 0.\n        Example 2: \"ababa\" -> \n            L=5: no duplicate -> then L=4: no duplicate -> then L=3: \n                i0: \"aba\" -> add\n                i1: \"bab\" -> add\n                i2: \"aba\" -> found, so ans=3, break inner, then break outer, print 3.\n        Example 3: \"zzz\" -> \n            L=3: no duplicate (only one substring: \"zzz\")\n            L=2: \n                i0: \"zz\" -> add\n                i1: \"zz\" -> found, ans=2, break, print 2.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But note: the above code breaks the inner loop and then the outer loop. However, the inner loop for L=3 in \"ababa\" breaks at i2, but we don't check i3? Actually, for L=3, the substring starting at i3 is \"aba\" (same as i0) and we break at i2. But wait, we break at i2 because we found a duplicate. Then we break the outer loop. It's okay because we only need one duplicate.\n\n        However, the above code may not break the outer loop correctly if we break the inner loop. We break the inner loop and then check if ans!=0 to break the outer loop. But note: we set ans = L and break the inner, then we break the outer. So yes.\n\n        But what if we break the inner loop, but then we don't break the outer loop? We have the condition:\n\n            if ans != 0:\n                break\n\n        So we break the outer loop.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a for-else structure. But the above is clear.\n\n        However, I think the initial version with exit(0) is acceptable for a competition problem, but sometimes judges don't like exit(0) in the middle. But the problem is small and we are just reading one string.\n\n        Since the problem is small, I'll choose the version without exit(0) for clarity and to avoid abrupt termination.\n\n        But note: the problem says the string is non-empty, but the input format is the first line contains the string. So we assume one string.\n\n        Final code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        ans = 0\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    ans = L\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if ans != 0:\n                break\n\n        print(ans)\n\n        However, wait: what if the string is very long? But the problem states that the string length is at most 100.\n\n        But let me test with a string that has no duplicate substring at all, for example \"abcd\":\n\n        n=4\n        L=4: \n            seen = set()\n            i0: substr = \"abcd\" -> not in seen -> add\n            then no more i (n-L+1 = 1, so only i0) -> no break, ans remains 0, then next L=3: \n            i0: \"abc\" -> add\n            i1: \"bcd\" -> add -> no break, then L=2: \n            i0: \"ab\" -> add\n            i1: \"bc\" -> add\n            i2: \"cd\" -> add -> no break, then L=1:\n            i0: \"a\" -> add\n            i1: \"b\" -> add\n            i2: \"c\" -> add\n            i3: \"d\" -> add -> no break, then print 0.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        But wait, the above code for L=1 in \"abcd\": \n            The inner loop runs from i=0 to n-L (which is 4-1=3) -> i from 0 to 3 (inclusive). \n            i0: \"a\" -> add\n            i1: \"b\" -> add\n            i2: \"c\" -> add\n            i3: \"d\" -> add -> no duplicate.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        One more test: \"a\" -> n=1, then L from 1 to 1:\n            i0: \"a\" -> add, then no more i (n-L+1 = 1, so i from 0 to 0) -> no break, then ans=0, then print 0.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        I think we are good.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the string is non-empty, so we don't have to handle empty string.\n\n        Let me submit the code.\n\n        But wait: the problem says the input is given as an array of strings? Actually, the example input is given as:\n\n            Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n        But the problem says: The first input line contains the string.\n\n        So we are reading one string.\n\n        However, the example input is shown as an array. But in competitive programming, the input is typically one string per test case. But the example input is shown as an array of three strings. \n\n        Actually, the problem statement says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then \"Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\"\n\n        But wait, the sample input has three test cases? Or is it showing the input as an array for multiple test cases?\n\n        Let me read the problem again: \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n        So it's one string.\n\n        But the example input is given as an array of three strings. This is confusing.\n\n        Actually, the example input is:\n\n            Input\n            ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n        and output\n\n            ['0', '3', '2']\n\n        This implies that there are three separate test cases? Or is it that the input is one string, but the example provided three examples?\n\n        Clarification: the problem says \"You're given a string\", so one string.\n\n        But the example input is written as an array. Maybe the example is showing multiple test cases? The problem statement doesn't specify multiple test cases.\n\n        However, the sample test 2: \"ababa\" -> output 3.\n\n        Since the problem says \"The first input line contains the string\", we assume one string per run.\n\n        But the example input is given as three strings. This might be a mistake in the problem statement.\n\n        Looking at the problem statement: \"Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\"\n\n        It might be that the input is one string, but the example is showing three examples. Or perhaps the problem expects to read from standard input and the input might contain multiple test cases? \n\n        But the problem says: \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n        So I think the example input is just illustrative of the expected outputs for three different inputs.\n\n        Therefore, we assume one string per run.\n\n        Code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        ans = 0\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    ans = L\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if ans != 0:\n                break\n\n        print(ans)\n\n        But wait: the problem says the string is non-empty, but what if the string has spaces? The problem says \"lower-case Latin letters\", so no spaces.\n\n        We use strip() to remove any extraneous whitespace.\n\n        This should be safe.\n\n        However, the problem says \"The first input line contains the string\", so we can simply do:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n        Now, I'll write the final code.\n\n        But note: the problem says the string is non-empty, so we don't have to worry about empty string.\n\n        However, the above code uses `break` in the inner loop and then breaks the outer loop. This is efficient.\n\n        Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"abcd\" -> 0\n        Example 2: \"ababa\" -> 3\n        Example 3: \"zzz\" -> 2\n\n        All correct.\n\n        But wait, there is an alternative solution: using a dictionary to store the substring and the last occurrence index? But we don't need that because we are storing all occurrences in a set and checking for duplicates.\n\n        Since the string is short, the set method is acceptable.\n\n        However, there is a known efficient algorithm for this problem (using suffix arrays) but n<=100, so we don't need that.\n\n        I'll stick with the above.\n\n        One more thing: the problem says the string consists of lower-case Latin letters, so no uppercase or special characters.\n\n        Code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        ans = 0\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    ans = L\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if ans != 0:\n                break\n\n        print(ans)\n\n        However, note: the above code does not break the outer loop if the inner loop breaks without finding a duplicate. We break the outer loop only if we set ans to a non-zero value.\n\n        But that's what we want: we are iterating from the largest L downward, so the first L for which we find a duplicate is the answer.\n\n        We can also use:\n\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            duplicate_found = False\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    duplicate_found = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if duplicate_found:\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)\n\n        print(0)\n\n        This is equivalent.\n\n        But I'll stick to the version without exit(0) because it's more structured.\n\n        Final code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        ans = 0\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    ans = L\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if ans != 0:\n                break\n\n        print(ans)\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap, and the solution must efficiently handle strings of varying lengths, up to 100 characters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous substring that occurs at least twice in the input string. The key observation here is that the solution must check all possible substrings from the longest to the shortest, ensuring that we find the longest valid substring early in the process.\n2. **Intuition**: By iterating from the longest possible substring length down to 1, we can leverage the fact that the first duplicate found during this iteration will be the longest valid substring. This approach ensures optimal performance by breaking early once the solution is found.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each possible substring length, we use a set to keep track of all unique substrings encountered. If a substring is encountered more than once, we immediately return the current substring length as the result. This method efficiently checks for duplicates without unnecessary computations.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm's time complexity is O(n^3) in the worst case, where n is the length of the string. This is because for each possible substring length (from n down to 1), we check up to O(n) substrings, each of length O(n). However, given the constraint that the string length does not exceed 100, this approach remains feasible and efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nans = 0\nfor L in range(n, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            ans = L\n            break\n        seen.add(substr)\n    if ans != 0:\n        break\nprint(ans)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Initialization**: The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will store the length of the longest valid substring found.\n3. **Iterating Over Substring Lengths**: The loop runs from the length of the string down to 1. For each length `L`, it checks all possible substrings of that length.\n4. **Tracking Substrings**: A set `seen` is used to keep track of substrings encountered. If a substring is found in the set, it means the substring has appeared before, and its length `L` is recorded as the answer.\n5. **Early Termination**: The loop breaks as soon as the longest valid substring is found, ensuring efficiency.\n6. **Output Result**: The result, stored in `ans`, is printed. If no duplicate substring is found, the output is 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging early termination and set operations to detect duplicates, providing an optimal solution for the given problem constraints.",
