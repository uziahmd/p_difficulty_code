And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read the first line to get n and k.\n Then, read the next line which has n integers.\n\n There are (n - k + 1) weeks. For each week, we take k consecutive days and compute the average for that week.\n Then we are to output the overall average of these averages? But note: the example input [3,4,7] with k=2 and n=3 gives two weeks: [3,4] and [4,7]. The average for the first week is (3+4)/2 = 3.5, for the second week (4+7)/2 = 5.5. Then the overall average is (3.5+5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5? But wait, the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n Let me check the example again: \n Input: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" -> Output: \"9.0000000000\"\n\n However, note: there are two weeks. The total sum of all sleep times in all weeks is (3+4) + (4+7) = 3+4+4+7 = 18. Then the total number of weeks is 2, so average is 18/2 = 9.0.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: we have two weeks, and the total sleep hours over all weeks is 18, then the average per week is 9.\n\n But wait, note that the problem says: \"the average sleeping time over all weeks\". So we are averaging the total sleep per week? Actually, no: we are averaging the average sleep per day? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"calculate average sleeping time of Polycarp over all weeks\". And a week is k consecutive days. The doctor asked for the average amount of hours of sleep per week.\n\n However, note: the example does not say \"average per day\", it says \"average per week\". But let's break down:\n\n In the example, two weeks: \n   Week1: 2 days, total sleep 7 hours -> average per week is 7 hours? \n   But wait, the example output is 9.0.\n\n Alternatively, if we consider the entire set of records, we have 3 days. How many weeks? 3-2+1 = 2 weeks.\n\n The problem says: \"consider k consecutive days as a week\", so each week is defined by k days. Then the average for a week is the total sleep in those k days divided by k? Or is it just the total sleep?\n\n But note: the example output is 9.0. And 9.0 is the average of the two weeks' total sleep (each week being the entire k days). \n\n Actually, the example calculation provided in the problem: \n   \"if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\n The example doesn't show the exact formula but note: \n   Total sleep for week1: 3+4 = 7 -> average for week1: 7/2 = 3.5\n   Total sleep for week2: 4+7 = 11 -> average for week2: 11/2 = 5.5\n   Then the overall average of the two weekly averages is (3.5+5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5.\n\n But wait, the example output is 9.0, not 4.5.\n\n Let me re-read: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\"\n\n But note: the example input has two weeks. The total sleep hours across both weeks is (3+4+4+7) = 18, but wait that counts the middle day twice. Actually, the two weeks are:\n   Week1: days 1 and 2 -> 3 and 4\n   Week2: days 2 and 3 -> 4 and 7\n\n So the total sleep hours in the two weeks is 3+4+4+7 = 18. But note: each week's sleep is the sum of k days, so we have two weeks, each with a sum. Then the average per week (without dividing by k again) would be (sum_week1 + sum_week2) / number_of_weeks.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"average amount of hours of sleep per week\". This could be interpreted as the average of the weekly totals? Or the average of the daily averages?\n\n But wait, the example output is 9.0, which is (7+11)/2 = 18/2 = 9.\n\n So the problem wants: for each week, we take the total sleep (which is the sum of the k days) and then average these totals over the weeks.\n\n However, note the example input \"1 1\\n10\": \n   n=1, k=1, so one week: total sleep is 10, so average is 10.\n\n Example 3: \n   Input: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n   Output: '28964.2857142857'\n\n Here, n=8, k=2, so there are 7 weeks.\n\n The total sleep for each week is:\n   Week1: 1+2 = 3\n   Week2: 2+4 = 6\n   Week3: 4+100000 = 100004\n   Week4: 100000+123 = 100123\n   Week5: 123+456 = 579\n   Week6: 456+789 = 1245\n   Week7: 789+1 = 790\n\n Then the total sum of these weekly totals is 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = 211870.\n\n Then the average is 211870 / 7 = 30267.142857...? But the expected output is 28964.2857142857.\n\n Wait, that doesn't match. \n\n Let me recalc: \n   3 + 6 = 9\n   9 + 100004 = 100013\n   100013 + 100123 = 200136\n   200136 + 579 = 200715\n   200715 + 1245 = 201960\n   201960 + 790 = 202750\n\n Then 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n So the weekly total is the sum of k consecutive days, and then we average the weekly totals (each week's total is summed) and then divide by the number of weeks.\n\n But note: the problem says \"average sleeping time over all weeks\". This means we are to take the average of the weekly totals. \n\n However, wait: the example [3,4,7] with k=2: \n   Weekly totals: [7, 11] -> average is (7+11)/2 = 9.\n\n So the problem is: we have (n-k+1) weeks. Each week i has a total sleep S_i = sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} a_j.\n Then the answer is the average of the S_i's: (S_1 + S_2 + ... + S_{n-k+1}) / (n-k+1)\n\n But note: we can also think of this as: total_sleep_all_weeks = (each element a_i is counted as many times as the number of weeks that include it).\n\n How many weeks include a particular day?\n   Day i (0-indexed) is included in weeks starting from max(0, i-k+1) to min(n-k, i) ? Actually, the week that starts at index j (0-indexed) goes from j to j+k-1. \n   Day i is included if j <= i <= j+k-1 -> j <= i and j >= i-k+1. Also j must be between 0 and n-k (inclusive).\n\n   So the number of weeks including day i is: \n        start_index_min = 0\n        start_index_max = i (because j<=i)\n        but also j>= i-k+1 and j<= n-k.\n\n   Therefore, the count for day i is: min(i, n-k, k-1+i) ??? Actually, the number of weeks that include day i is: \n        left_bound = max(0, i - k + 1)\n        right_bound = min(i, n-k)   [because the last week that includes day i starts at most at i, but the last week starts at n-k (so the last week is from n-k to n-k+k-1 = n-1)]\n\n   Alternatively, the count is: \n        count_i = min(i+1, n-i, k, n-k+1)  -> no, that's not linear.\n\n   Actually, the condition for day i is that the week starts from j where j from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k). The number of such j is: \n        L = max(0, i-k+1)\n        R = min(i, n-k)\n        Then if L <= R, count = R - L + 1, else 0.\n\n   But note: i from 0 to n-1.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a simpler method: the first day (i=0) is only in one week (week starting at 0). The last day (i=n-1) is only in one week (week starting at n-k). \n\n   We can precompute an array `counts` for each day i: \n        count_i = min(i+1, n-i)   [if we were considering a sliding window without the fixed k?] but wait, we have k.\n\n   Actually, the window is fixed length k. The condition is: the week must start at j such that j <= i and j>= i-k+1 and j from 0 to n-k.\n\n   So: \n        j_min = max(0, i-k+1)\n        j_max = min(i, n-k)   [because the week must end by n-1, so j+k-1 <= n-1 -> j <= n-k]\n\n   Then count_i = max(0, min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1)   [if the interval is non-empty]\n\n   Then the total sum of all weekly totals is: \n        total = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i * count_i\n\n   And then the average is total / (number_of_weeks) = total / (n-k+1)\n\n   Let's test with n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]:\n        i=0: \n            j_min = max(0,0-2+1)=max(0,-1)=0\n            j_max = min(0, 3-2)=min(0,1)=0\n            count_0 = 0-0+1 = 1\n        i=1:\n            j_min = max(0,1-2+1)=max(0,0)=0\n            j_max = min(1, 1)=1\n            count_1 = 1-0+1 = 2\n        i=2:\n            j_min = max(0,2-2+1)=max(0,1)=1\n            j_max = min(2,1)=1   [because n-k=1]\n            count_2 = 1-1+1 = 1\n\n        Then total = 3*1 + 4*2 + 7*1 = 3 + 8 + 7 = 18\n        Number of weeks = 3-2+1 = 2\n        Average = 18/2 = 9.0 -> matches.\n\n   Now test with example 3: n=8, k=2, a=[1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n        We'll compute counts for each i (0-indexed from 0 to 7):\n\n        i=0: j_min = max(0,0-2+1)=0, j_max=min(0,8-2)=min(0,6)=0 -> count_0=1\n        i=1: j_min = max(0,1-2+1)=0, j_max=min(1,6)=1 -> count_1=2\n        i=2: j_min = max(0,2-2+1)=1, j_max=min(2,6)=2 -> count_2=2 (since 2-1+1=2)\n        i=3: j_min = max(0,3-2+1)=2, j_max=min(3,6)=3 -> count_3=2\n        i=4: j_min = max(0,4-2+1)=3, j_max=min(4,6)=4 -> count_4=2\n        i=5: j_min = max(0,5-2+1)=4, j_max=min(5,6)=5 -> count_5=2\n        i=6: j_min = max(0,6-2+1)=5, j_max=min(6,6)=6 -> count_6=2\n        i=7: j_min = max(0,7-2+1)=6, j_max=min(7,6)=6 -> count_7=1\n\n        Then total = 1*1 + 2*2 + 4*2 + 100000*2 + 123*2 + 456*2 + 789*2 + 1*1\n                   = 1 + 4 + 8 + 200000 + 246 + 912 + 1578 + 1\n                   = 1+4+8+200000+246+912+1578+1\n\n        Let me add step by step:\n          1+4=5, +8=13, +200000=200013, +246=200259, +912=201171, +1578=202749, +1=202750.\n\n        Then average = 202750 / (8-2+1) = 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n   So this matches.\n\n   Therefore, we can compute:\n        total_sum = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            j_min = max(0, i - k + 1)\n            j_max = min(i, n - k)   # because the last week starts at n-k (0-indexed: the last week is from n-k to n-1)\n            if j_min <= j_max:\n                count_i = j_max - j_min + 1\n            else:\n                count_i = 0\n            total_sum += a[i] * count_i\n\n        num_weeks = n - k + 1\n        average = total_sum / num_weeks\n\n   However, note: the above calculation for count_i might be simplified.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the count for day i is:\n        count_i = min(i+1, n-i, k, n-k+1)   -> no, that doesn't work.\n\n   Actually, the count for day i is the number of weeks that cover day i. The first week that covers day i is the week starting at i-k+1 (if i-k+1 >=0), and the last week that covers day i is the week starting at i (if i <= n-k). But note: the week must start at or before i and at or after i-k+1, and the week must start at most at n-k.\n\n   So: \n        left = max(0, i-k+1)\n        right = min(i, n-k)\n\n   Then count_i = max(0, right - left + 1)\n\n   But note: we can also use a two-pointer or prefix sums to avoid the inner loop, but since we are iterating over each i anyway, and n up to 200000, this is O(n) which is acceptable.\n\n   However, we can compute the counts without the inner condition by using a different approach: using a difference array.\n\n   But the problem constraints are up to 200000, and doing one pass is acceptable.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Read n, k\n   Read list a of n integers.\n\n   num_weeks = n - k + 1\n\n   total_sum = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        left_bound = max(0, i - k + 1)\n        right_bound = min(i, n - k)   # because the last week starts at index n-k (0-indexed) and we require the week starting at j must be <= i and j<=n-k.\n\n        # But note: if right_bound < left_bound, then skip (count=0)\n        if left_bound <= right_bound:\n            count_i = right_bound - left_bound + 1\n        else:\n            count_i = 0\n        total_sum += a[i] * count_i\n\n   average = total_sum / num_weeks\n\n   Format the average to have at least 6 decimal places.\n\n   However, note: the example input \"1 1\\n10\" -> \n        n=1, k=1\n        num_weeks = 1\n        i=0: left_bound = max(0,0)=0, right_bound = min(0, 1-1)=min(0,0)=0 -> count_0=1\n        total_sum = 10*1 = 10\n        average = 10/1 = 10.0\n\n   So we output '10.0000000000'\n\n   But wait, what if k is 0? The problem states k>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the condition for the bounds.\n\n   Another way to think: the week must start at index j (from 0 to n-k). Then for day i, it is covered by weeks starting from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k). \n\n   But note: the week starting at j uses days j, j+1, ..., j+k-1. Therefore, day i is in week j if and only if j <= i <= j+k-1, which is equivalent to j <= i and j >= i-k+1. And j must be in [0, n-k].\n\n   So the above formula is correct.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the above formula for right_bound uses `n-k` (which is the last week start index). \n\n   But wait: the last week starts at index n-k (so the week is from n-k to n-k+k-1 = n-1). So the condition for j is j in [0, n-k] (inclusive). \n\n   So the code is:\n\n   n, k = map(int, input().split())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   num_weeks = n - k + 1\n\n   total_sum = 0.0   # but we can use integer until the division\n\n   for i in range(n):\n        # Calculate the range of week starts that include day i\n        low = max(0, i - k + 1)\n        high = min(i, n - k)   # because the week must start at most at i (so that i is included) and at most at n-k (the last week)\n\n        if low <= high:\n            count_i = high - low + 1\n        else:\n            count_i = 0\n\n        total_sum += a[i] * count_i\n\n   average = total_sum / num_weeks\n\n   Then format the average to have 10 decimal places.\n\n   However, note: the example output uses 10 decimal places. We can use formatting.\n\n   Example: \n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n   But wait: what if the average is an integer? We want trailing zeros.\n\n   This formatting will do that.\n\n   Let me test with the examples:\n\n   Example 1: 9.0 -> \"9.0000000000\"\n   Example 2: 10.0 -> \"10.0000000000\"\n   Example 3: 28964.2857142857 -> \"28964.2857142857\"\n\n   However, note: our calculation for example 3: \n        total_sum = 202750, num_weeks=7, 202750/7 = 28964.285714285714... -> so when we format, we should get 28964.2857142857 (10 digits after the decimal, but the example output has 10 digits).\n\n   But note: the example output is given as: '28964.2857142857'\n\n   Our formatted output: \n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(28964.285714285714)) \n\n   Let me run in Python:\n\n        >>> x = 28964.285714285714\n        >>> print(\"{:.10f}\".format(x))\n        28964.2857142857\n\n   That matches.\n\n   However, note: the total_sum is an integer, and num_weeks is an integer, but the average might be fractional.\n\n   But we are using floating point division. Since n and k can be up to 200000, and a[i] up to 10^5, the total_sum can be as large as 200000 * 10^5 * (at most k) -> wait, but k is at most 200000, but note that the count_i for each day is at most k (actually at most n-k+1, which is at most 200000). \n\n   The maximum total_sum: \n        worst-case: all a[i]=10^5, and each a[i] is multiplied by at most (n) (but actually by the count_i which is at most n-k+1, which is <= n). \n\n        Then total_sum <= 10^5 * n * (n) = 10^5 * 200000 * 200000 = 4e15, which is within the range of Python floats (which can handle integers exactly up to around 2**53, and 4e15 is about 4*10^15, which is less than 2**53 ~ 9e15). \n\n   But wait: actually, the count_i for a day i is at most min(i+1, n-i, k, n-k+1) but wait, no: we computed by the formula. The maximum count_i is k? Actually, no: the count_i is the number of weeks that include day i, which is the number of weeks that start from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k). \n\n   The maximum value of count_i is the minimum of k and (i+1) and (n-i) and (n-k+1)? Actually, the maximum count_i occurs in the middle and is limited by k (because you cannot have more than k consecutive days covering a single day? Actually, no: the same day can be covered by multiple windows. The maximum number of windows that cover a day is the minimum of (i+1, n-i, k, n-k+1) ??? Not exactly.\n\n   Actually, the count_i is bounded by k (because the window is of length k, so a day can be covered by at most k consecutive windows? Actually, the windows that cover day i are the ones that start from i-k+1 to i, but we are constrained by the available weeks (from 0 to n-k). So the maximum is min(k, i+1, n-i, n-k+1) ? \n\n   But note: the condition for the week start j: j from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k). The length is min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1.\n\n   The maximum value of this expression is k (when the day is in the middle and the entire window of k weeks is available). \n\n   So the maximum count_i is k, which is up to 200000.\n\n   Then the total_sum is at most 10^5 * 200000 * 200000 = 4e15, which is 4000000000000000, and that is within the range of Python integers (and floats) but we are using float division. \n\n   However, to avoid floating point precision issues, we can use integer arithmetic until the division? \n\n   But the problem requires absolute or relative error <= 1e-6, and the numbers are large, but the average is a float. \n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        average = total_sum / num_weeks\n\n   Since total_sum and num_weeks are integers, we can use integer division if we want to avoid floating point, but the problem requires a floating point representation.\n\n   But note: the numbers are integers, so the average might be fractional. \n\n   However, the constraints say that the answer must be with at least 6 decimal digits. Using float might lose precision for very large numbers, but 4e15 is 4 followed by 15 zeros, which is an integer, and then we divide by an integer (num_weeks, which is up to 200000). \n\n   The maximum num_weeks is 200000, so the division is 4e15 / 200000 = 20e9, which is 20000000000, which is an integer. But wait, total_sum might not be divisible by num_weeks.\n\n   However, the problem allows absolute or relative error 1e-6, and float in Python (double precision) has about 15-16 significant digits, so for numbers up to 4e15, the fractional part might be lost? \n\n   But note: the total_sum is the sum of integers, and then we divide by an integer. The division might not be exact. \n\n   However, the problem says: output with at least 6 decimal digits. \n\n   We can use:\n\n        average = total_sum / num_weeks\n\n   and then format to 10 decimal places.\n\n   But to be safe, we can use decimal? Or we can use integer arithmetic and then format the fractional part? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        average = total_sum / num_weeks\n\n   and rely on Python's float having enough precision for 6 decimal digits. \n\n   Since the numbers are integers, the absolute error in the float representation for the division might be due to the fact that we are representing a rational number. But the denominator is at most 200000, and the numerator is at most 4e15, so the quotient is at most 20000000000 (which is 2e10). \n\n   The double precision can represent integers exactly up to 2**53 ~ 9e15, so 4e15 is exactly representable. Then the division: we are dividing two integers, one up to 4e15 and the other up to 200000. \n\n   The quotient has at most 10 integer digits and then 6 fractional digits? Actually, the quotient can be as large as 2e10 (which is 11 digits) and then we need 6 fractional digits. \n\n   But the problem is that the quotient might not be an integer. The fractional part is (total_sum % num_weeks) / num_weeks.\n\n   The double precision can represent numbers with about 15 significant digits. The integer part has up to 11 digits, so the fractional part has up to 4 digits? Actually, we are printing 10 fractional digits.\n\n   However, the requirement is absolute or relative error <= 1e-6. The rounding in double precision should be sufficient because the numbers are integers and the denominator is not too large (200000). \n\n   But let me test with a big number: \n\n        total_sum = 10**15  (exactly representable)\n        num_weeks = 200000\n        quotient = 10**15 / 200000 = 5000000000.0   -> exact.\n\n   Another test: \n        total_sum = 10**15 + 1\n        num_weeks = 200000\n        quotient = (10**15+1)/200000 = 5000000000.0000005 -> but wait, 10**15+1 is 1000000000000001, and 200000 * 5000000000 = 1000000000000000, so the remainder is 1, so quotient = 5000000000 + 1/200000 = 5000000000.0000005.\n\n   Now, in double precision, 5000000000.0000005 is represented exactly? \n\n   Actually, the number 5000000000.0000005 is 5000000000 + 5e-7. The double precision has 52 bits for the fraction. \n\n   But 5e-7 is 0.0000005, which is 5 * 10^-7. The exponent is adjusted, and 0.0000005 is 5 * 2^-something. \n\n   However, 0.0000005 is 1/200000, which is an integer division. But 1/200000 is 0.000005? No, wait: 1/200000 = 0.000005, but we have 1/200000? Actually, we have 1/200000 = 0.000005, but in our example we had 1/200000 added to 5000000000, so 5000000000 + 1/200000 = 5000000000.000005.\n\n   I think I miscalculated: \n        (10**15+1) / 200000 = 10**15/200000 + 1/200000 = 5e9 + 5e-6 = 5000000000.000005\n\n   So the fractional part is 0.000005, which is 5e-6, and that is representable in double precision.\n\n   The problem requires 1e-6 absolute error, so we are safe.\n\n   But note: the example outputs 10 decimal places. We are using formatting that rounds to the nearest representation.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(total_sum / num_weeks))\n\n   However, there's a caveat: the formatting might round the number to 10 decimal places, but if the number is very close to rounding up, we might get an off-by-one in the last digit? But the problem allows absolute or relative error <= 1e-6, so even if we round to 6 decimal places, we are safe. But we are outputting 10 decimal places, so the rounding to 10 decimal places is done by the formatter.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point\", meaning we can output more. We are outputting 10.\n\n   This solution is O(n) and should be efficient for n up to 200000.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   One more edge: when k == n, then num_weeks=1, and the count_i for i from 0 to n-1: \n        i=0: left_bound = max(0,0-n+1)=0, right_bound = min(0, n-n)=0 -> count_0=1\n        i=1: left_bound = max(0,1-n+1)=0, right_bound = min(1, n-n)=0 -> wait, n-n=0, so min(1,0)=0 -> then if 0<=0 -> count_1=1\n        ... so every day is included in exactly one week (the only week). \n\n   Then total_sum = sum(a) * 1, and average = sum(a) / 1 = sum(a). Correct.\n\n   Code:\n\n   n, k = map(int, input().split())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   num_weeks = n - k + 1\n   total_sum = 0\n\n   for i in range(n):\n        low = max(0, i - k + 1)\n        high = min(i, n - k)   # because the week must start at most at n-k (the last week starts at n-k, so that the week ends at n-1)\n\n        if low <= high:\n            count_i = high - low + 1\n        else:\n            count_i = 0\n\n        total_sum += a[i] * count_i\n\n   average = total_sum / num_weeks\n\n   print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n   But wait, the example [3,4,7] with k=2: \n        n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n        i=0: low = max(0,0-2+1)=0, high = min(0,3-2)=min(0,1)=0 -> count_0=1 -> 3*1=3\n        i=1: low = max(0,1-2+1)=0, high = min(1,1)=1 -> count_1=2 -> 4*2=8\n        i=2: low = max(0,2-2+1)=1, high = min(2,1)=1 -> count_2=1 -> 7*1=7\n        total_sum=3+8+7=18, average=18/2=9.0 -> formatted to 9.0000000000.\n\n   It works.\n\n   However, note: the condition for high: we are using `min(i, n-k)`. What if n-k is negative? But n>=k, so n-k>=0.\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   Let's run the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" -> 9.0000000000\n   Example 2: \"1 1\\n10\" -> 10.0000000000\n   Example 3: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\" -> 28964.2857142857\n\n   But wait, the example input for example3 was provided as:\n        \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n\n   And we computed 2",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time of Polycarp over all possible weeks in his sleep records. Each week is defined as `k` consecutive days, and there are `(n - k + 1)` such weeks. The goal is to compute the average of the total sleep time for each week.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to consider all possible consecutive `k`-day periods (weeks) in a sequence of `n` days. For each week, we sum the sleep times of the days in that week. The final result is the average of these weekly sums.\n2. **Insight**: Instead of recalculating the sum for each week from scratch, which would be inefficient, we can leverage the observation that each day's sleep time is included in multiple weeks. Specifically, a day at position `i` is included in all weeks that start from `max(0, i - k + 1)` to `min(i, n - k)`. The number of such weeks is `count_i = min(i, n - k) - max(0, i - k + 1) + 1`, provided the range is valid.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We iterate through each day, compute the number of weeks that include it, multiply the day's sleep time by this count, and accumulate the total. The average is then obtained by dividing the total by the number of weeks `(n - k + 1)`.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each day exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 2·10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    num_weeks = n - k + 1\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        low_bound = max(0, i - k + 1)\n        high_bound = min(i, n - k)\n        \n        if low_bound <= high_bound:\n            count_i = high_bound - low_bound + 1\n        else:\n            count_i = 0\n            \n        total_sum += a[i] * count_i\n        \n    average = total_sum / num_weeks\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of days) and `k` (days per week), followed by a list of `n` integers representing daily sleep times.\n2. **Initialization**: Calculate the number of weeks as `num_weeks = n - k + 1` and initialize `total_sum` to accumulate the sum of sleep times across all weeks.\n3. **Processing Each Day**: For each day `i`:\n   - Determine the range of weeks that include day `i` using `low_bound` and `high_bound`.\n   - If the range is valid (`low_bound <= high_bound`), compute the number of weeks (`count_i`) that include day `i`.\n   - Multiply the day's sleep time by `count_i` and add to `total_sum`.\n4. **Output**: Compute the average by dividing `total_sum` by `num_weeks` and print it formatted to 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average by leveraging the observation that each day's contribution to the total is proportional to the number of weeks it appears in, thus avoiding redundant calculations.",
