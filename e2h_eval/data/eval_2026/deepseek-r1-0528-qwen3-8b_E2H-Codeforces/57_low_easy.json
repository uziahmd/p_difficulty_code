His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x in the first line, then two lists of n integers: a (first tour) and b (second tour).\n\n We know that Vasya has at least x points in total. But note: the problem says the results have no names. However, we know that there exists two indices i, j (possibly same, but note: the participant's two tours are fixed for them) such that a_i + b_j >= x.\n\n But note: the problem does not specify that the same index must be used for Vasya? Actually, wait: the input gives two lists of n integers each. The Olympiad has n participants, each with one score in the first tour and one in the second.\n\n However, we are told: \"there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such that ai + bj ≥ x\", meaning that Vasya is one of the participants and his total is at least x.\n\n But note: it's also guaranteed that Vasya was present. So we are to consider that one of the participants is Vasya. However, the problem doesn't tell us which one. And we are allowed to assign the two scores arbitrarily to Vasya? Actually, no: the two lists are the scores for the first and second tour respectively, and each participant has one score from the first list and one from the second list. But wait: the problem says \"the results have only points, no names\" and we are given two separate lists.\n\n Clarification: The two lists are of the same n participants. Each participant's first tour score is one of the a_i, and their second tour score is one of the b_j. But we don't know which a_i goes with which b_j.\n\n However, note: the problem states \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\". So there is a fixed pairing of a_i and b_j for each participant, but we don't know the pairing.\n\n But wait: the problem does not give us the pairing. We are only given two lists of n numbers. Then, how do we assign the scores to Vasya?\n\n Actually, the problem does not specify that we know Vasya's exact scores. We know that there exists two indices i, j (which might be the same or different) such that a_i + b_j >= x, and that these two indices correspond to the same participant? Or can we choose any two indices i and j arbitrarily?\n\n Let me read the problem again: \"The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiard but the problem is, the results have only points, no names.\" and \"Vasya got at least x points for both tours\".\n\n The key: we are allowed to assign the two lists arbitrarily to the participants. But note: the problem says \"each participant\" has one from the first and one from the second. So the entire set of participants' scores is the multiset of the two lists.\n\n However, the catch: Vasya is one participant, so we must assign two numbers (one from the first list and one from the second) to him. But we are free to choose which two numbers? Actually, no: the two lists are the scores of the n participants, so the assignment of the two lists to the participants is fixed? \n\n But wait, the problem says: \"the results have only points, no names\", meaning we don't know which score from the first list corresponds to which from the second. However, the two lists are given independently. So the pairing is arbitrary? Actually, the problem does not fix the pairing. \n\n However, note: the total table is built by the sum of the two scores (each participant's first score and their second score). The pairing is fixed by the problem's guarantee: each participant has one from the first and one from the second. But we don't know which. \n\n But here's the catch: we are allowed to assign the pairing arbitrarily? Because the problem says the results have no names, so the teacher can assume any pairing? Actually, the problem does not specify the pairing, so we must consider all possible pairings.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won.\"\n\n How can we compute the best and worst place?\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We know that Vasya must have two numbers: one from the first list and one from the second list. But we don't know which ones. However, the condition is that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= x. Actually, the problem guarantees that there is at least one such pair.\n\n 2. But note: the entire set of participants is fixed. The two lists are given, and",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible places Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The key insight is that the pairing of participants' scores from the first and second tours can vary, affecting their final standings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - We are given two lists, `a` (first tour scores) and `b` (second tour scores), each containing `n` integers.\n   - Vasya's total score must be at least `x`, meaning there exists some pair `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\n   - The participants' rankings are determined by their total scores (sum of both tours). If multiple participants have the same total, their rankings can be assigned arbitrarily.\n\n2. **Intuition**:\n   - **Best Place**: To find the best possible place for Vasya, we should maximize his total score and minimize the number of participants with higher or equal totals. This involves pairing Vasya's highest possible score with another high score to ensure as few participants as possible have higher totals.\n   - **Worst Place**: Conversely, to find the worst place, we need to minimize Vasya's total score while ensuring as many participants as possible have higher or equal totals. This involves pairing Vasya's lowest possible score with a lower score to allow others to surpass him.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting**: Both lists `a` and `b` are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n   - **Two Pointers Technique**: For the best place, we use two pointers to count how many participants can have a total score greater than or equal to Vasya's chosen score. For the worst place, we similarly use two pointers but adjust the counting method.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - Sorting the lists takes `O(n log n)` time.\n   - The two-pointer technique operates in `O(n)` time for both best and worst scenarios.\n   - Overall, the solution efficiently handles the constraints with a time complexity of `O(n log n)`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b_list = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+2*n]))\n    \n    a_list.sort()\n    b_list.sort()\n    \n    m1 = n + 1\n    m2 = 0\n    j = n - 1\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        while j >= 0 and a_list[i] + b_list[j] >= x:\n            m1 -= 1\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            break\n            \n    j = 0\n    count_worst = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        while j < n and a_list[i] + b_list[j] >= x:\n            count_worst += 1\n            j += 1\n        else:\n            continue\n            \n    if count_worst == 0:\n        m2 = n\n    else:\n        m2 = n - count_worst\n        \n    print(f\"{m1} {m2}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of participants `n`, the minimum total score `x`, and the two lists of scores for the first and second tours.\n2. **Sorting**: Both lists of scores are sorted to facilitate efficient searching using the two-pointer technique.\n3. **Best Place Calculation**:\n   - We start by assuming the worst possible place (`m1` initialized to `n + 1`).\n   - Using two pointers, we count how many participants can have a total score greater than or equal to Vasya's potential score. Adjusting the pointers helps in determining the highest rank Vasya can achieve.\n4. **Worst Place Calculation**:\n   - We initialize `m2` to zero and traverse the lists to count how many participants can have a total score less than `x`. The worst place is derived from the count of participants who can surpass Vasya's minimal score.\n5. **Output**: The best and worst possible ranks are printed, providing the solution to the problem.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible rankings by leveraging sorting and two-pointer techniques, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
