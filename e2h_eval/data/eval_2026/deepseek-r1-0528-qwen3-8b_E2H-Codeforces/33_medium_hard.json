You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj.

    "thought": "\n We are allowed to replace at most m digits (each element in s can be used at most once) but we can choose which ones to use.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to use not all elements from s. So we can choose a set of replacements.\n\n The goal is to maximize the number.\n\n Observation:\n Since we can choose any positions and the sequence s provides digits, we want to replace some digits in a with higher digits from s.\n\n But note: we have a fixed multiset of available digits (from s). However, we cannot change the order of the digits in a.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We have an original string `a` (without leading zeros) and a string `s` (the available digits).\n\n 2. We want to perform a set of replacements such that the resulting number is as large as possible.\n\n 3. Important: Each digit in `s` can be used at most once.\n\n 4. We can think greedily: We want to replace the digits in `a` with larger ones from `s`. However, we must consider the positions.\n\n 5. But note: if we replace a digit at an earlier position, it has more weight. Therefore, we should try to improve the leftmost digits first.\n\n 6. However, we have a limited set of digits in `s`. We can sort the available digits in descending order? Actually, we don't need to sort the entire s, because we are allowed to use each only once.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We can consider: for each position in `a` (from left to right), we want to see if we can replace the current digit with a larger one from `s`, without using too many replacements.\n\n But note: we are allowed to use the same digit multiple times? No, each element in s can be used at most once.\n\n However, we have the entire multiset s. So we can take the best available digit for each position, but we have to consider that if we use a digit for an earlier position, it's gone.\n\n How about:\n\n Step 1: Count the frequency of each digit in `s`.\n\n Step 2: We traverse from left to right in `a` and try to replace the current digit with a digit from `s` that is greater than the current digit. But we want to use the smallest available digit that is greater (to save the larger ones for later) but wait: no, we want to use the largest digit available for the earliest position? \n\n Actually, we want to maximize the overall number. The standard way for such problems is:\n\n - We want to use the largest available digits on the leftmost positions. But if we use a large digit on a left position, then we might not have a chance to use even larger digits on the next left positions? Actually, no: because the leftmost positions have the highest weight.\n\n However, consider: we have two digits to replace: [1, 0] and two digits from s: ['9','8'].\n\n If we replace the first '1' with '9', then we get 90, which is better than replacing the first with '8' and the second with '9' (which would be 91, but wait: actually 91 is bigger than 90). \n\n But wait: in this example, we have two replacement digits: ['9','8'].\n\n Let me clarify: \n   Option 1: Replace the first digit: 1 -> 9, then we have 9_ and then we can replace the second digit 0->8 -> 98.\n   Option 2: Replace the first digit: 1->8, then 0->9 -> 89.\n\n Clearly, 98 > 89.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to use any subset. But we have two operations. We must use two? Actually, we can use at most two, but we don't have to use both. But we want the maximum. So we will use both.\n\n But the problem is: we have a fixed multiset of digits. We want to assign the best available digits to the positions that will give the highest improvement.\n\n Standard greedy for such problems (like making the largest number with given digits) is:\n\n - We want to replace the leftmost digits that are too small.\n\n However, note: sometimes we might not want to use a replacement if the digit is already high? \n\n Example: a = \"19\", s = \"9\". Then we can replace the first digit 1 with 9 -> \"99\", which is good.\n\n But what if we have a = \"19\" and s = \"8\"? Then we can replace the first digit 1 with 8 -> \"89\", but if we don't replace the first digit, we can replace the second digit 9 with 8 -> \"18\", which is worse. So we must replace the first digit.\n\n However, what if we have a = \"19\", and s = \"89\"? Then we can do two replacements. But note: we can only use each once. Then we can replace the first digit with 9 and the second digit with 8? Then we get \"98\", which is the maximum.\n\n But wait, we are allowed to use at most two, so we use two. We can choose which two to use. However, we cannot break the order: we must assign the digits to positions arbitrarily (but the order of digits in a remains, we just change individual digits).\n\n However, note: the problem says we can choose an arbitrary position i and replace with sj. And each element in s can be used at most once.\n\n So we are allowed to assign the digits arbitrarily (any digit from s to any position, but without repeating). This is similar to having a multiset of digits and we can assign them arbitrarily to the positions (but we are constrained by the original digits: we can only increase or leave as is? Actually, we can also decrease, but why would we? We want maximum value. So we only want to replace a digit if the assigned digit is greater than the original.\n\n However, wait: what if we have two digits: a=\"19\", and s=\"98\". Then we can assign the 9 to the first digit and 8 to the second, or 8 to the first and 9 to the second. The best is 98.\n\n But note: we cannot exceed the length of s, and we cannot use a digit more than once.\n\n Approach:\n\n We want to maximize the number. We can consider:\n\n 1. We are going to use a multiset (or count) of the available digits.\n\n 2. We traverse from left to right and try to replace the current digit with the largest available digit that is greater than the current digit. But wait: if we use a large digit now, then we might not have a chance to use even larger digits for the next positions? \n\n However, note: the leftmost digits are the most significant. So we should try to use the largest available digit that is greater than the current digit. But then, after we use that digit, we remove it and continue.\n\n But is that optimal?\n\n Consider: a = \"123\", s = \"987\"\n\n Without replacement: 123\n With one replacement: we can replace the first 1 with 9 -> 923, or with 8 -> 823, or with 7 -> 723. Clearly 923 is the best for one replacement.\n With two replacements: we can replace the first two: 9 and 8 -> 983, or 9 and 7 -> 973, or 8 and 7 -> 873. The best is 983.\n With three: 987.\n\n So we want to assign the largest available digits to the leftmost positions.\n\n However, we are constrained by the condition that we can only replace a digit if the replacement digit is greater than the original? Not necessarily: sometimes we might want to use a replacement that is less than the original? No, because we want to maximize. We only want to replace if the new digit is greater than the original? Actually, no: we can also replace with a digit that is less, but that would lower the number. So we only consider replacements that yield a digit greater than the original.\n\n But wait: what if we have a = \"111\", and s = \"000\"? Then we cannot improve. But if we have s = \"002\", then we can replace one of the digits with 2, but only if we replace a digit that is 1 (so 2>1). \n\n However, there is a catch: we are allowed to use the digits arbitrarily. But we cannot break the order of a. So we must assign the digits to specific positions.\n\n Algorithm:\n\n We have two strings: `a` and `s`.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We'll count the frequency of each digit in `s`. Since the digits are from '0' to '9', we can use an array `count` of size 10.\n\n 2. We traverse the digits of `a` from left to right. For each digit (converted to int) at position i:\n\n    - We try to find the largest digit in `s` (that we still have) that is greater than the current digit. However, if we have multiple same digits, we use the largest one.\n\n    But note: we are allowed to use the digits arbitrarily. We don't have to use the largest one if we can use a smaller one for a more significant position? Actually, no: because we are at a significant position, we want the highest digit we can get for this position.\n\n    However, consider: if we use a very large digit here, then we might run out of large digits for the next positions. But the leftmost positions are more important. So we should use the largest available digit that is greater than the current digit.\n\n    But wait: what if the current digit is low, and we have two large digits: say 9 and 8. We use 9 here, then we have only 8 for the next. But if the next digit is low, then 8 is good. Alternatively, if the next digit is high, then we might want to save 9 for the next? \n\n    Example: a = \"19\", s = \"98\"\n        Option1: use 9 for the first: becomes 9_, then for the second: we have 8 -> 98.\n        Option2: use 8 for the first: becomes 8_, then for the second: we have 9 -> 89. But 98 > 89.\n\n    So we should use the largest available digit for the current position.\n\n    However, what if the current digit is already high? Then we don't need to replace. But what if we have a digit that is high, but we have a very high digit that we can use for a later position? \n\n    Example: a = \"99\", s = \"10\". Then we cannot replace because we don't have a digit greater than 9. So we leave it.\n\n    But consider: a = \"19\", s = \"90\". \n        We have two digits: 9 and 0.\n        For the first digit: we can replace 1 with 9 -> 99, then we have 0 left for the next, but the next is 9 and 0<9, so we don't replace the second. Result: 99.\n        Alternatively, we could replace the first with 0? That gives 09 -> but wait, the problem says the printed number shouldn't contain leading zeros. But note: the original doesn't have leading zeros, and we are replacing an arbitrary digit. However, if we replace the first digit (which is the most significant) with 0, then we get a number with a leading zero? That is not allowed. But the problem says the printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n    So we must avoid leading zeros.\n\n    How do we handle leading zeros?\n\n    Note: We are only replacing digits. The original number does not have leading zeros.\n\n    When replacing the first digit, we must not replace it with 0, unless the entire number becomes zero? But wait, the problem says the printed number shouldn't contain leading zeros. So if we replace the first digit and the first digit becomes 0, then that would be a leading zero. Therefore, we cannot replace the first digit if the replacement digit is 0.\n\n    However, what if the entire number becomes zero? Then we have to output \"0\". But note the original number doesn't have leading zeros, so the original first digit is non-zero. If we replace the first digit with 0, then the number becomes having a leading zero, which is not allowed. Therefore, we must avoid replacing the first digit with 0.\n\n    But wait: what if we have a number like \"0000\" originally? The problem states that the given number a doesn't contain leading zeros. So the first digit is not zero.\n\n    Therefore, we don't have to worry about the original having leading zeros.\n\n    However, when replacing, we must ensure that the first digit is not replaced by 0. For other positions, we can replace with 0? But note: if we replace a non-leading digit with 0, that might be acceptable if the number is not starting with 0.\n\n    Example: a = \"10\", s = \"0\". Then we can replace the second digit (0) with 0? That doesn't change the number. But we are allowed to not use all. However, if we replace the first digit with 0, then we get \"00\", which is not allowed because of leading zeros. But we don't have to. So we skip.\n\n    So the rule: we can only replace a digit if the replacement digit is not 0 OR if we are replacing a non-first digit? Actually, for the first digit, we require that the replacement digit is not 0. For other digits, we can use 0, but note: if we replace a digit in the middle or end with 0, then the number might become smaller, so we wouldn't do that if we are trying to maximize.\n\n    However, we only consider replacements that yield a digit greater than the current one. So if the current digit is, say, '5', then we won't use 0 because 0 < 5.\n\n    So the issue of 0 only arises when we have a digit in `s` that is 0 and we are considering replacing a digit that is not 0? Then we wouldn't use 0 because it is less. But wait: if we have a digit that is 0 in `s` and we are replacing a digit that is, say, '1', then 0 is less than 1, so we skip. \n\n    The only time we use 0 is if the current digit is 0 and we have a 0 in s? Then we cannot replace because 0 is not greater than 0. But wait, we can replace with a digit equal to 0? The problem says we can replace, but the goal is to maximize. Replacing 0 with 0 doesn't change the number. So we can skip.\n\n    However, note: sometimes we might have multiple zeros and we are forced to use them? But we are allowed to use not all. So we ignore zeros.\n\n    Therefore, we can focus on digits from '1' to '9'.\n\n    But wait: what if we have a digit that is 0 in the original and we are replacing it with a digit from s that is greater than 0? Then we would do that. But note: the original digit is 0, and we replace it with a digit from s that is greater than 0 (say 1) then we get 1, which is better.\n\n    So the algorithm:\n\n    We have a count array for digits 0-9 (initially, we count the frequency of each digit in s).\n\n    Steps:\n\n    1. Convert `a` to a list of characters (or keep as string) and we'll build the result.\n\n    2. We'll traverse the digits of `a` from left to right.\n\n    3. For each digit d (as char) at position i:\n\n        - Let current_digit = int(d)\n        - We want to find the largest digit available (from 9 down to current_digit+1) that we have in our count array.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to use the digits arbitrarily, so we can use any digit from the available set.\n\n        However, we are going to use the largest one available that is greater than the current_digit.\n\n        Why the largest? Because we want to maximize the current position.\n\n        Then, if we find one, we replace the current_digit with that digit and update the count (decrement the count for that digit).\n\n        But wait: what if we have multiple same digits? Then we use one occurrence of that digit.\n\n    However, there is a caveat: we might have multiple digits that are the same and we want to use the one that is the largest. But we are iterating from 9 down to current_digit+1, so we pick the largest one.\n\n    But what if we don't have any digit greater than the current_digit? Then we leave it.\n\n    4. After traversing, we have the replaced digits.\n\n    But wait: is that always optimal?\n\n    Consider: we have two replacements and two positions. We have two digits in s: ['9','8'] and a='12'. \n\n        Position0: current_digit=1. We look for the largest digit in s that is >1 -> 9. We replace with 9. Now s has ['8'].\n        Position1: current_digit=2. We look for the largest digit in s that is >2 -> 8. We replace with 8. Result: 98.\n\n    Now consider if we had s=['8','9'] (same multiset) then same result.\n\n    Another example: a='12', s='91'\n\n        Position0: current_digit=1. We look for the largest digit >1: we have 9 and 1. We choose 9. Then we replace and remove one 9. Now s has ['1'].\n        Position1: current_digit=2. We look for the largest digit >2: we don't have any (since 1<2). So we leave it. Result: 92.\n\n        But wait, what if we use the 1 in the first position? Then we get 12 -> then for the second position we have 9. Then we get 19. 19 is less than 92. So we did the correct thing.\n\n    But wait, what if we have a='12', s='19' (same multiset) then:\n\n        Option: use 9 for the first: 92.\n        Or use 1 for the first: then we have 12, then use 9 for the second: 19.\n\n        We choose 92.\n\n    However, what if we have a='19', s='21'? \n\n        We have two digits: 2 and 1.\n\n        Position0: current_digit=1 -> we can use 2 (since 2>1). Then we replace the first digit with 2 -> \"29\". Then we have one digit left: 1. For the second digit: 9, we don't replace because 1<9. So we get 29.\n\n        But what if we don't replace the first digit? Then we have the original \"19\", and then we can replace the second digit with 1? But 1<9, so we don't. So we leave it as 19.\n\n        But 29 is better than 19.\n\n    However, consider: a='19', s='12'\n\n        We have two digits: 1 and 2.\n\n        Position0: current_digit=1 -> we can use 2 (2>1). Then we replace the first digit with 2 -> \"29\". Then we have 1 left. For the second digit: 9, we don't use 1 because 1<9. So result is 29.\n\n        But wait, we could have used the 1 for the first digit? Then we get 19, and then we can't replace the second because 2<9? Actually, we can replace the second digit with 2, but 2<9, so we don't. So 19 vs 29 -> 29 is better.\n\n    But what if we have a='21', s='19'\n\n        Position0: current_digit=2. We look for digits in s that are >2: none (we have 1 and 9? Actually 9>2, so we can use 9). Then we replace the first digit with 9 -> \"91\". Then we have 1 left. For the second digit: 1, we can replace if we have a digit >1? We have 1, which is not greater. So we leave it. Result: 91.\n\n        Alternatively, if we don't replace the first digit, then we can replace the second digit: 1->9? Then we get 29. But 91>29.\n\n    However, wait: in the above, we did use the 9 for the first digit. But what if we use the 9 for the second digit? Then the first digit remains 2, and the second becomes 9 -> 29. But 91 is better.\n\n    So the greedy from left to right using the largest available digit that is greater than the current digit is correct.\n\n    But note: we are not forced to use the largest digit. We are using the largest digit that is greater than the current digit. And that is the best we can do for the current position.\n\n    However, what if we have two digits that are the same? Then we use the largest one (which is the same) and that's okay.\n\n    Implementation:\n\n    We have a frequency array for digits 0-9. We'll initialize:\n\n        count = [0]*10\n        for char in s:\n            count[int(char)] += 1\n\n    Then, for each digit in `a` (from left to right):\n\n        d_original = int(current_char)\n\n        We try from digit=9 down to d_original+1:\n\n            if count[digit] > 0:\n                then we replace the current digit with str(digit), update count[digit] -= 1, and break.\n\n        Otherwise, we leave the digit as is.\n\n    But wait: what if we have multiple digits that are the same? Then we use one occurrence.\n\n    However, what if we have a='111', s='999' (three 9s). Then:\n\n        First digit: 1 -> replace with 9, count[9] becomes 2.\n        Second digit: 1 -> replace with 9, count[9] becomes 1.\n        Third digit: 1 -> replace with 9, count[9] becomes 0.\n\n        Result: '999'\n\n    What if we have a='111', s='998'? \n\n        First digit: 1 -> use 9 (largest available above 1), then count[9]=1, count[8]=1.\n        Second digit: 1 -> use 9 (since 9>1 and available), then count[9]=0, count[8]=1.\n        Third digit: 1 -> use 8 (since 8>1 and available). Result: '998'\n\n    But wait, is there a better way? \n\n        We could have used the 8 for the third digit and saved the 9 for the second? Then we would get 998 as well.\n\n    Actually, we are using the largest available digit at each step, so we are using the 9s first, then the 8.\n\n    But what if we have a='123', s='9187'? \n\n        We want to maximize: we have digits [9,1,8,7] (but we can use each only once)\n\n        Step-by-step:\n\n        Start: a = \"123\", s = [9,1,8,7] (but we have counts: count[9]=1, count[1]=1, count[8]=1, count[7]=1)\n\n        First digit: 1 -> we can use 9 (largest above 1). Then a becomes \"923\", and s becomes [1,8,7] (counts: 9:0,1:1,8:1,7:1)\n        Second digit: 2 -> we can use 8 (largest above 2). Then a becomes \"983\", and s becomes [1,7]\n        Third digit: 3 -> we can use 7 (largest above 3). Then a becomes \"987\".\n\n        Result: 987.\n\n        But note: we could have done:\n\n        First digit: 1 -> 9, then second digit: 2 -> 8, then third digit: 3 -> 7. Same result.\n\n    However, consider: a='123', s='9817'\n\n        Step-by-step:\n\n        First digit: 1 -> 9 (using the 9) -> then s=[8,1,7]\n        Second digit: 2 -> 8 -> s=[1,7]\n        Third digit: 3 -> 7 -> s=[1] -> result: 987.\n\n        Alternatively, if we didn't use the 9 for the first digit, and used 8 for the first? \n\n        But wait: the largest digit above 1 is 9, so we use 9.\n\n    One more: a='21', s='19'\n\n        First digit: 2 -> we look for digits from 3 to 9: we have 9. Use 9 -> \"91\". Then second digit: 1 -> we look for digits from 2 to 9: we have 1 (but 1 is not above 1) so we leave it. Result: \"91\".\n\n    This matches.\n\n    However, there is a potential performance issue: we are iterating from 9 down to (current_digit+1) for each digit in a. The length of a is up to 10^5, and we iterate over at most 9 possibilities per digit. So worst-case 9 * 10^5 = 900000, which is acceptable.\n\n    But note: we are updating the count array. We have an array of size 10, so we can also precompute the available digits in sorted order and then use a pointer? Actually, we are doing:\n\n        for d in range(9, current_digit, -1):\n            if count[d] > 0:\n                # use d\n                ...\n\n    This is efficient.\n\n    However, one more edge: the original number might be very long (10^5 digits). We are processing each digit in O(1) (since 9 is constant). So total O(n) which is acceptable.\n\n    But note: the input s can be up to 10^5, and we are reading the entire s to build the count array. Then we process a (up to 10^5) digits.\n\n    Code:\n\n    Steps:\n\n        a_str = input().strip()\n        s_str = input().strip()\n\n        # Build frequency array for s_str\n        count = [0]*10\n        for char in s_str:\n            digit = int(char)\n            count[digit] += 1\n\n        # Now, convert a_str into a list of characters (or we can work with string and then build a new string)\n        res = []  # we'll build the result as a list of characters\n        n = len(a_str)\n\n        # We'll traverse each digit in a_str\n        for i, char in enumerate(a_str):\n            d_original = int(char)\n            # Check from 9 down to d_original+1\n            found = False\n            for d in range(9, d_original, -1):\n                if count[d] > 0:\n                    # Use this digit\n                    res.append(str(d))\n                    count[d] -= 1\n                    found = True\n                    break\n            if not found:\n                # Then we use the original digit, unless we are at the first digit and the original digit is 0? \n                # But the original doesn't have leading zeros, so the first digit is non-zero. And we are allowed to use the original.\n                res.append(char)\n\n        # But wait: what if we break the leading zero rule? We must ensure that the first digit is not replaced by 0. \n        # In our algorithm, we are replacing a digit only if we found a digit greater than the current one. So for the first digit, if the original is non-zero, then we are either replacing it with a non-zero (since we start from 9 down) or leaving it. And we never replace with 0 because 0 is less than the original (unless the original is 0, but the original doesn't have leading zeros so the first digit isn't 0). \n\n        # However, what if we have a number that originally has a 0 in the middle? Then we might replace it with a non-zero, but that's okay.\n\n        # But wait: what if we replace a digit that is 0 (in the middle) with a digit from s that is greater than 0? Then that's okay.\n\n        # However, we must consider: what if we have a digit in s that is 0 and we are replacing a digit that is 0? We skip because 0 is not greater than 0.\n\n        # But what if we have a digit in s that is 0 and we are replacing a digit that is, say, 1? Then 0<1, so we skip.\n\n        # So the code above should be safe.\n\n        # But wait: we are building a string from the list `res`. However, we are allowed to use not all digits from s. So we are using the digits we found.\n\n        # However, we must output the number without leading zeros. Our algorithm ensures that the first digit is either the original (non-zero) or a digit greater than the original (so non-zero).

This is the greedy method and it is known to work for such problems.\n\n        # Print the result_str.\n\n    However, wait: let me test with the provided examples.\n\n    Example 1: Input \"1024\\n010\"\n\n        a_str = \"1024\", s_str = \"010\"\n\n        Frequency: \n            count[0] = 2, count[1]=1, others 0.\n\n        Processing:\n\n        i0: char '1' -> d_original=1. We look for d from 9 down to 2: none. Then we append '1'. But wait, we have a '0' and a '1' in s. But 0<1 and 1==1, so we don't use. Then we leave it.\n\n        i1: char '0' -> d_original=0. We look for d from 9 down to 1: we have 1 (count[1]>0). So we use 1. Then we update count[1] to 0. Now the number becomes \"11\" so far.\n\n        i2: char '2' -> d_original=2. We look for d from 9 down to 3: none. Then we leave it -> '2'\n\n        i3: char '4' -> d_original=4. We look for d from 9 down to 5: none. Then we leave it -> '4'\n\n        Result: \"1124\"\n\n        Expected output: \"1124\"\n\n    Example 2: Input \"987\\n1234567\"\n\n        a_str = \"987\", s_str = \"1234567\"\n\n        Frequency: count[1]=1, count[2]=1, count[3]=1, count[4]=1, count[5]=1, count[6]=1, count[7]=1, others 0.\n\n        Process:\n\n        i0: '9' -> look for d from 9 to 10: but 10 is invalid, so from 9 to 10: actually from 9 down to 10? Our loop goes from 9 down to 9+1? Wait, the loop is for d in range(9, d_original, -1). Here d_original=9, so we go from 9 down to 10? Actually, the range in Python: range(9, 9, -1) -> empty. So we leave the first digit.\n\n        i1: '8' -> from 9 down to 9 (since 8+1=9) -> so we check 9: but count[9] is 0, then 8? We don't check 8 because the loop stops at 9 (and 9 is not greater than 8? Actually, we are checking from 9 down to 9 (because d_original+1 is 9) and we stop at 9. Then we check 9: not available. Then we leave the 8.\n\n        i2: '7' -> from 9 down to 8: we check 9 -> not available, then 8 -> not available (because we have only digits 1-7). Then we leave it.\n\n        Result: \"987\", which is expected.\n\n    But wait: the example input is given as two examples:\n\n        Example 1: Input \"1024\\n010\" -> Output \"1124\"\n        Example 2: Input \"987\\n1234567\" -> Output \"987\"\n\n    However, the example input is provided as:\n\n        ['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n    But the actual input format is:\n\n        First line: integer a (as a string of digits)\n        Second line: string s (without separators)\n\n    So the example input is two separate test cases? Actually, the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", and then gives two examples.\n\n    But the code reads two lines.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes.\"\n\n    But wait: what if we have a='0'? Then the original has a leading zero. But the problem says a doesn't contain leading zeroes, so a is a positive integer? Then a won't be \"0\".\n\n    Therefore, the code should work.\n\n    But wait: in the example, the first example input is \"1024\\n010\", which is two lines.\n\n    However, the example output is given as ['1124', '987'].\n\n    So we output:\n\n        print(result_str)\n\n    But wait: what if we have a='0'? The problem says the given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes, so we don't have to worry.\n\n    However, there is a potential issue: what if we have a digit that is 0 in the middle, and we replace it with a non-zero? Then the number doesn't have leading zeros because the first digit is non-zero.\n\n    But what if the first digit is replaced by a non-zero? Then the number is valid.\n\n    But wait: what if the entire number is replaced by zeros? Then we would have a number with leading zeros? \n\n    Example: a='0000' -> but the problem states that a doesn't contain leading zeros, so this case is not present.\n\n    However, what if a='0' (single digit)? Then we have a leading zero? But the problem says the given number a doesn't contain leading zeros, and it is a positive integer. So we don't have to worry.\n\n    But wait: the problem says \"positive integer\", so a>=1.\n\n    Therefore, the code is as follows.\n\n    However, note: the example input \"1024\\n010\" produces \"1124\", which is correct.\n\n    But wait: in the example, the second example is \"987\\n1234567\", which produces \"987\", which is correct.\n\n    But wait: what if we have a='1999', s='999'? Then we can replace the first digit 1 with 9, and then we have two 9s left. Then we can replace the next three digits? \n\n        Step-by-step:\n\n        a='1999', s='999' (count[9]=3)\n\n        First digit: 1 -> replace with 9, then count[9]=2, and the number becomes \"9999\" (then we have two more 9s) -> but wait, we have three 9s, so after replacing the first, we have two 9s. Then for the second digit: 9 -> we don't replace because we need a digit >9 (none). Similarly for the rest.\n\n        Result: \"9999\"\n\n        But wait, we have three 9s in s. We use one for the first, then we have two left. But the rest of the digits are 9, so we don't replace. So the result is \"9999\".\n\n        However, we are allowed to use the two 9s for the subsequent digits? But we don't need to because they are",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the value of a given number `a` by performing a series of digit replacements using digits from a sequence `s`. Each digit in `s` can be used at most once, and we are allowed to skip any digits in `s` if they do not contribute to increasing the value of `a`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to replace some digits in `a` with digits from `s` such that the resulting number is as large as possible. The key observation here is that replacing a digit in an earlier position (leftmost) with a larger digit has a more significant impact on the overall value of the number compared to replacing digits in later positions.\n\n2. **Intuition**: We should prioritize replacing the leftmost digits first with the largest possible digits from `s` that are greater than the original digit. This greedy approach ensures that each replacement contributes maximally to the number's value from the most significant positions onward.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Frequency Array**: We use a frequency array to count occurrences of each digit (0-9) in the sequence `s`.\n   - **Greedy Replacement**: For each digit in `a` (from left to right), we check if there is a digit in `s` that is larger than the current digit. If such a digit exists, we replace the current digit with the largest available one (to maximize the number's value) and decrement the count of that digit in the frequency array. If no such digit exists, we leave the digit unchanged.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: \n   - **Time Complexity**: The algorithm processes each digit of `a` once, and for each digit, it checks up to 9 possible digits (from 9 down to the current digit + 1). Thus, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of `a`, which is efficient given the constraints (n ≤ 10^5).\n   - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) for the frequency array (fixed size 10) and O(n) for storing the result, which is also efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a_str = input().strip()\n    s_str = input().strip()\n    \n    count = [0] * 10\n    for char in s_str:\n        digit = int(char)\n        count[digit] += 1\n            \n    res = []\n    for char in a_str:\n        d_original = int(char)\n        found = False\n        for d in range(9, d_original, -1):\n            if count[d] > 0:\n                res.append(str(d))\n                count[d] -= 1\n                found = True\n                break\n        if not found:\n            res.append(char)\n                \n    print(''.join(res))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the input number `a` as a string and the sequence `s` as another string.\n2. **Frequency Array Setup**: A frequency array `count` of size 10 is initialized to zero. This array keeps track of how many times each digit (0-9) appears in `s`.\n3. **Processing Each Digit**: For each digit in `a` (processed from left to right), the code checks if there is a digit in `s` that is larger than the current digit. If found, the largest such digit is used to replace the current digit, and its count in `s` is decremented. If no such digit is found, the original digit remains unchanged.\n4. **Output Result**: The modified digits are combined into a string and printed, representing the maximum possible value of `a` after all replacements.\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the number's value by leveraging a greedy strategy, ensuring optimal use of the available digits in `s` while adhering to the constraints.",
