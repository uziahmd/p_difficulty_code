Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from standard input.\n The idea is:\n 1. Combine the first two strings (guest name and host name) and count the total frequency of each letter.\n 2. Compare the frequency of letters in the third string (the pile) with the combined frequency of the first two.\n 3. If the two frequencies match exactly (same letters and same counts), then output \"YES\", otherwise \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the problem says that the pile should be exactly the letters from the two names (without extra or missing).\n\n Steps:\n - Read the three lines, strip the newlines.\n - Concatenate the first two lines to form a combined string.\n - Count the frequency of each character in the combined string and in the third string.\n - Compare the two frequency counts.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Combined string: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n   Pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   But note: the example input in the problem is given as a list of strings for multiple examples. However, the problem states that we read three lines.\n\n Let's break down the example:\n\n   Example 1: \n        guest = \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        host = \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as:\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...] \n\n   Actually, the example input is provided as three separate lines.\n\n   So, for the first sample, the three lines are:\n        Line1: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        Line2: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        Line3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Now, if we combine Line1 and Line2: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n   Now, let's count the letters in the combined string and in the pile string:\n\n   Combined: \n        S: 3, A: 2, N: 1, T: 1, C: 1, L: 1, U: 1, D: 2, E: 1, M: 1, O: 1, R: 1, Z: 1\n\n   Pile:\n        S: 3, A: 2, N: 1, T: 1, M: 1, O: 1, R: 1, Z: 1, D: 2, E: 1, L: 1, U: 1\n\n   They are the same.\n\n   However, note: the example input in the problem statement is given as a list of three strings for one example, but actually the problem input has three lines.\n\n   But wait, the example input provided in the problem is:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   This is confusing because it seems like the example input is given as a list of three strings, each string containing multiple lines? \n\n   Actually, looking at the example input, it's three examples. But the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\".\n\n   So, we are to assume that the input has three lines.\n\n   Therefore, we can read three lines.\n\n   However, the example input provided in the problem is:\n\n        Example 1: \n            Input: \n                SANTACLAUS\n                DEDMOROZ\n                SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n        Example 2:\n            Input: \n                PAPAINOEL\n                JOULUPUKKI\n                JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        Example 3:\n            Input: \n                BABBONATALE\n                FATHERCHRISTMAS\n                BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n   So, we must design for one set of three lines.\n\n   How to handle:\n\n        line1 = input().strip()\n        line2 = input().strip()\n        line3 = input().strip()\n\n   Then, we check if the sorted list of characters of line1+line2 equals the sorted list of characters of line3.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use frequency counting.\n\n   Since the length is at most 100, we can simply do:\n\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        combined_counter = Counter(line1 + line2)\n        pile_counter = Counter(line3)\n\n        Then compare the two counters.\n\n   But note: what if there are extra letters? Then the pile_counter will have more of some letter or a letter not in the combined.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"verify that there are no extra letters\" meaning the pile must have exactly the letters of the two names.\n\n   So, we can do:\n\n        if combined_counter == pile_counter:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   Let's test with the second example:\n\n        Example 2:\n            guest = \"PAPAINOEL\"\n            host = \"JOULUPUKKI\"\n            pile = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        Combined: \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n\n        Count for 'P': \n            In combined: P appears 3 times (from PAPA: two P's and then one more in JOULUPUKKI?

Actually, FATHERCHRISTMAS has no A? Let me check: \n                FATHERCHRISTMAS: F,A,T,H,E,R,C,H,R,I,S,T,M,A,S -> wait, two A's? \n                Actually, \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\": \n                    F:1, A:2, T:2, H:2, E:1, R:2, C:1, I:1, S:2, M:1\n\n            So combined: \n                B:2 (from guest) + 0 (host) = 2\n                A: in guest: \"BABBONATALE\": A appears twice? \n                    B A B B O N A T A L E -> A:3 (positions 1,6,8) and host: A:2 -> total A:5\n\n            Pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n            Let me count in the pile:\n\n                B: 3 (from BAB, then BONAT, then ...) -> actually: \n                    BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n                B: \n                    First three: BAB -> two B's (if we consider the first two: B and then A and then B -> so two B's already)\n                    Then later: B in BONAT, then another B in BONATALLE? Actually, let's split:\n\n                B: \n                    BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n                Breaking it down: \n                    B, A, B, C, H, R, I, S, T, M, A, S, B, O, N, A, T, A, L, L, E, F, A, T, H, E, R\n\n                So B: indices 0,2,12 -> three B's.\n\n            So the combined has 2 B's, the pile has 3 -> so they don't match.\n\n        Therefore, the example outputs \"NO\".\n\n   So the code above should work.\n\n   However, note: the example input in the problem is provided as a list of three strings for three examples. But the problem states that the input file has three lines.\n\n   Our code reads three lines.\n\n   But wait, the example input provided in the problem is:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   This is actually a representation of three examples, each example being a string that contains three lines separated by '\\n'. \n\n   However, the problem says: the input file consists of three lines.\n\n   So, if we are running the program and the input is given as:\n\n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Then our code will read:\n\n        s1 = \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        s2 = \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        s3 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   And that's correct.\n\n   But note: the example input string representation includes newline characters. In reality, when we read from stdin, the lines are separated by actual newlines.\n\n   We use .strip() to remove any trailing newline or spaces, but the problem says the input contains only uppercase letters. So we can use .strip() to remove any newline at the end of each line.\n\n   However, if the input is provided exactly as the example string (with the newline characters as part of the string), then we must consider that the example string representation is just for illustration.\n\n   But the problem states: \"The input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, ...\"\n\n   So, we can rely on reading three lines.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Edge: empty lines? The problem says \"All lines are not empty\", so we don't have to worry about empty lines.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        import sys\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        if len(data) != 3:\n            # The problem says three lines, but if we get more or less, we can still process?\n            # However, the problem states three lines. We'll assume three.\n            # But to be safe, if we have less than 3, then we cannot proceed. Print NO?\n            # Or we can use the first three non-empty lines?

But note: the problem says \"The input file consists of three lines\", so we are reading three lines.\n\n   However, if we run the program and the input is provided as:\n\n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Then the splitlines() will return:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS', 'DEDMOROZ', 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n   And we process as above.\n\n   But if the input is provided as:\n\n        \"SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   (as a single string with two newlines) then splitlines() would split into three parts.\n\n   So it's safe.\n\n   However, the problem says the input file has three lines.\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1:\n\n        s1 = \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        s2 = \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        s3 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        combined = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n        Counter for combined: \n            S:3, A:2, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:1, R:1, Z:1\n\n        Counter for s3: \n            S:3, A:2, N:1, T:1, M:1, O:1, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, L:1, U:1\n\n        They are the same.\n\n   Example 2:\n\n        s1 = \"PAPAINOEL\"\n        s2 = \"JOULUPUKKI\"\n        s3 = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        combined: \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n        Counter(combined): \n            P:3, A:2, I:2, N:1, O:2, E:1, L:2, J:1, U:2, K:2\n\n        Counter(s3): \n            J:1, O:2, U:3, L:3, N:1, A:2, P:2, I:2, E:1, K:2\n\n        Not the same.\n\n   Example 3:\n\n        s1 = \"BABBONATALE\"\n        s2 = \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n        s3 = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        combined: \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n\n        Let me count manually for combined:\n\n            B:2 (from \"BABBONATALE\")\n            A: in \"BABBONATALE\": A appears at index1, then at index6, index8 -> 3; in \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\": A appears at index1 (if we consider the entire string) but wait, the entire string is \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n\n            Actually, we can use code to count, but we know from the example that the pile has an extra B and extra L and U.\n\n        We'll trust the Counter.\n\n   Therefore, we'll submit the code.\n\n   However, note: the example input representation in the problem had three examples, but we are writing for one test case.\n\n   Since the problem says the input file has three lines, we assume one test case.\n\n   Let me run the code with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: YES -> correct.\n   Example 2: NO -> correct.\n   Example 3: NO -> correct.\n\n   But wait, the example input representation in the problem was given as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   This is actually three separate inputs? \n\n   But the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\", meaning one test case.\n\n   However, the example output is:\n\n        ['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n   So if we were to run the program for the first example, we get 'YES'; for the second, 'NO'; for the third, 'NO'.\n\n   But the problem says: \"You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the door in the morning.\"\n\n   This is one test case.\n\n   The example input representation was just showing three examples.\n\n   Therefore, we assume one test case.\n\n   Code:\n\n        import sys\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        if len(data) < 3:\n            # According to the problem, there are three lines, but if we get less, we cannot form the combined string.\n            # We'll output NO because the input is incomplete.\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            s1 = data[0].strip()\n            s2 = data[1].strip()\n            s3 = data[2].strip()\n            combined = s1 + s2\n            c1 = Counter(combined)\n            c2 = Counter(s3)\n            if c1 == c2:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   This should be the solution.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the letters are uppercase.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves comparing the frequency of each letter in the combined names with the frequency of letters in the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: The input consists of three lines: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Frequency Counting**: Use a counter to count the occurrences of each letter in the combined string and another counter for the pile of letters.\n4. **Comparison**: If the frequency counts of the combined names and the pile match exactly, output \"YES\"; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match in letter frequencies using Python's `collections.Counter` class, which simplifies the counting process. The solution handles all edge cases, including extra or missing letters, by ensuring the counts are identical.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if len(data) < 3:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    \n    s1 = data[0].strip()\n    s2 = data[1].strip()\n    s3 = data[2].strip()\n    \n    combined = s1 + s2\n    c1 = Counter(combined)\n    c2 = Counter(s3)\n    \n    if c1 == c2:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all lines from standard input. The first two lines are the guest's and host's names, and the third line is the pile of letters.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's and host's names are concatenated into a single string to form the combined names.\n3. **Counting Letters**: The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to count the occurrences of each letter in both the combined names and the pile of letters.\n4. **Checking Match**: The program checks if the counts of letters in the combined names match those in the pile. If they match exactly, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies whether the pile of letters can be rearranged to form the original names by leveraging frequency counting, ensuring correctness and simplicity.",
