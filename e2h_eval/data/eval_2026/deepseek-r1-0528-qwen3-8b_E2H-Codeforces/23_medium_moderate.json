            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three tiles. Each tile is a string of two characters: first digit (1-9) and second one of 'm','p','s'\n\n We can draw any number of tiles (each draw adds one tile) and we can choose arbitrarily (even duplicates).\n\n We need the minimum number of draws so that there is at least one mentsu (which is either a koutsu or a shuntsu).\n\n Note: \n   - A koutsu is three identical tiles (same number and same suit).\n   - A shuntsu is three consecutive numbers in the same suit (but note: consecutive in the usual order, not wrapping around). \n\n However, note that the hand might have more than three tiles after drawing, but we are only required to form at least one mentsu. But note: the problem says she has three tiles initially, then draws extra. And we want the minimum number of draws.\n\n Since we can draw as many as we want, we can also consider forming a mentsu from the drawn tiles and the existing ones.\n\n However, note: the mentsu must be formed by at least one set (three tiles) in the entire hand. But we are allowed to draw arbitrarily and we don't care about the rest.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Case 0: If the hand already has a mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence), then answer 0.\n\n Otherwise, we consider drawing 1, 2, 3, ... tiles until we can form at least one mentsu.\n\n But note: sometimes we might form a mentsu by drawing 1 or 2 tiles, and sometimes we might need up to 4 draws? Actually, let's think:\n\n Possibilities:\n\n With 0 draws: already a mentsu -> 0\n\n With 1 draw: \n   - We add one tile. Then we have four tiles. But note: we only need one mentsu (three tiles). So we can use the new tile and two of the existing ones.\n\n How can we form a triplet?\n   - If we have two of the same tile, then adding one more makes a triplet. So if there are two tiles with the same representation (same number and same suit), then we can complete a triplet by drawing one.\n\n   - For a sequence: we have two possibilities for the drawn tile to form a sequence with two existing tiles (if we have two tiles that are consecutive, then the drawn tile can be the missing one). Also, note that the sequence must be of three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n Example: \n   Input: ['3p', '9m', '2p'] -> we have two tiles in p: 3p and 2p. Then we can draw 1p to form [2p, 3p, 1p] (but wait, 1p,2p,3p is a sequence). Or draw 4p to form [2p,3p,4p]. \n\n But note: the example input was given as \"3p 9m 2p\", and the output was 1.\n\n However, note that we can also form a triplet if we have two of the same. But in the example, we have two different suits and two p's: one 2p and one 3p. \n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check for existing mentsu (triplet or sequence) in the initial three.\n\n 2. If none, check if we can form a triplet by drawing one: \n        Condition: There exists a tile such that there are already two of that tile.\n\n 3. Else, check if we can form a sequence by drawing one:\n        We need to find two tiles that are part of a potential sequence. For a given suit, we look for two tiles that are consecutive or have a gap of one.\n\n        Example: \n          In the same suit, if we have [x, y] (with x<y) then we can form a sequence by drawing the missing number z such that {z, x, y} forms a consecutive triplet.\n\n        Conditions for two tiles (a,b) (a<=b) to form a sequence with one draw:\n          Case 1: a = b-1, then we can draw a-1 to get (a-1, a, b) OR we can draw b+1 to get (a, b, b+1). But note: we can only draw one tile, and we have two tiles. However, we cannot form two sequences at once, but we only need one.\n\n        But note: we have three tiles. We might have two tiles in one suit and one in another. So we should group by suit.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider: \n          For each suit, group the tiles by number. Then for each suit, look at the distinct numbers and their counts.\n\n        However, note: we are only considering two tiles in the same suit? Actually, we have three tiles in total. So if we have two in one suit and one in another, then we can use the two in the same suit to form a sequence by drawing one more.\n\n        But note: the sequence requires three consecutive numbers. So with two tiles, say [2,4] in the same suit, we cannot form a sequence by drawing one because we would need either 3 or 5, but then we have two non-consecutive numbers. Actually, the two tiles must be adjacent or have a gap of one.\n\n        Actually, for two tiles (x, y) (x<=y) in the same suit, the possibilities for a sequence are:\n          If x+1 == y, then we can draw x-1 to form (x-1, x, y) or y+1 to form (x, y, y+1). But note: the numbers must be between 1 and 9.\n\n        Example: [2,3] -> can draw 1 or 4.\n        Example: [3,4] -> can draw 2 or 5.\n        Example: [1,2] -> can draw 3 (because 0 is invalid).\n\n        However, if we have three tiles, we might have two tiles that are consecutive and one that is not, but then we can use two of them to form a sequence.\n\n        But note: we have three tiles. We might have two tiles in one suit and one in another. Then we can use the two in the same suit to form a sequence by drawing one.\n\n        Also, what if we have three tiles all in the same suit? Then we might have three consecutive numbers? Then we have a sequence already (so 0). Or if they are not consecutive, we might form a sequence by drawing one.\n\n        However, we are checking for 1 draw: so we are allowed to draw one tile and then have four tiles. But we don't require the entire hand to be used. We just need at least one mentsu.\n\n        So if we have three tiles: [1m, 2m, 3m] -> already a sequence (0 draws). \n\n        What if we have [1m, 2m, 4m]? Then we can draw 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] (then we have an extra 4m, but that's okay). \n\n        But wait, we are only forming one mentsu. So if we draw 3m, then we have the triplet [1m,2m,3m] (which is a sequence) and the 4m left. \n\n        So for two tiles that are consecutive, we can draw the missing one to complete the sequence.\n\n        Similarly, if we have two tiles that are not consecutive, but we have three tiles, we might have two tiles that are consecutive? Actually, we have three tiles. We can try to see if any two of the same suit form a consecutive pair.\n\n        Steps for 1-draw for sequence:\n\n        Group the three tiles by suit.\n\n        For each suit, consider the numbers present. If there are at least two numbers in the same suit, then we can look at the set of numbers for that suit.\n\n        For a given suit, if there are two numbers a and b (a<=b) such that b - a == 1, then we can complete the sequence by drawing either a-1 or b+1 (if within 1 to 9). But note: we can only draw one tile, and we don't care about the other tiles.\n\n        However, we might have three numbers in the same suit? Then we can check if they form a consecutive triplet? But wait, three numbers in the same suit might be consecutive, then we already have a sequence (so 0 draws). Or if they are not consecutive, then we might form a sequence by drawing one? Actually, no: because we have three numbers, and we are going to use three of them. But if they are not consecutive, then we cannot form a sequence with these three. However, we can use two of them and the drawn one? \n\n        Actually, we have four tiles after drawing. But we don't require the entire hand to be a mentsu. We just require that there exists a mentsu (three tiles) in the hand. \n\n        Example: [1m,2m,4m] -> we can draw 3m and then we have [1m,2m,3m] (a sequence) and 4m. So yes.\n\n        But what if we have [1m,3m,4m]? Then we can draw 2m to form [1m,2m,3m] (and leave 4m). \n\n        However, what if we have [1m,1m,2m]? Then we have two 1m and one 2m. Then we can form a triplet by drawing one more 1m (so that's the triplet case) or we can form a sequence by drawing a 0m? (invalid) or 3m? But wait: if we draw 3m, then we have [1m,1m,2m,3m]. Then we can form a sequence [1m,2m,3m] (using one 1m, 2m, 3m) and leave the other 1m. So both possibilities (triplet or sequence) are available. But we already checked for triplet: we have two 1m so drawing one more 1m gives a triplet. So we don't need to consider the sequence for this case when we already have two same.\n\n        So the plan:\n\n        Step 1: Check if there is already a triplet or a sequence.\n\n        Step 2: If not, check for 1 draw: \n            Option A: There is a tile that appears at least twice (so we can complete a triplet by drawing one more of that tile). \n            Option B: There is a suit with at least two distinct numbers that are consecutive (i.e., differ by 1) and the missing number (either the lower-1 or the upper+1) is between 1 and 9. Also, we don't necessarily have two consecutive numbers in the same suit, but we can have two numbers that are consecutive and then the third tile is in a different suit. \n\n        But note: we have three tiles. So we can have two tiles in one suit and one in another, or three tiles in the same suit.\n\n        Step 3: If not, check for 2 draws: \n            Option A: Drawing two tiles to complete a triplet: if we have one tile of a kind, then we need two more. \n            Option B: Drawing two tiles to complete a sequence: \n                Example: We have two tiles that are two apart, then we need the middle one and one more? Actually, no: to form a sequence we need three consecutive. So if we have [1m, 4m] (and the third tile is in a different suit) then we can draw 2m and 3m? But wait, we are allowed to draw two. Then we can form [1m,2m,3m] and [4m] remains. But we only need one mentsu.\n\n                However, we can also use two draws to complete two different sequences? Actually, no: we only need one mentsu.\n\n                But note: maybe we can form a triplet by drawing two tiles? That would be if we have one copy of a tile and we draw two more. \n\n            However, there is a possibility: we can form a mentsu by drawing two tiles even if we don't have two of the same or consecutive two. \n\n            Example: [1m, 1p, 1s] -> we don't have any two same, and the numbers are all same but different suits. Then we cannot form a triplet because triplet requires same suit. Then we can form a sequence? But the suits are different. So we must form a sequence in one of the suits. \n\n            Wait, but we have one tile per suit. Then we cannot form a sequence (since we need three consecutive in the same suit). Then we can draw two more tiles: say two 1m? Then we have [1m,1m,1m] (triplet) and two 1p and 1s left. So that would be two draws.\n\n            Alternatively, we can draw two tiles to complete a sequence: \n                For example, in the m-suit: we have 1m. Then we can draw 2m and 3m to form [1m,2m,3m]. But wait, we have to draw two tiles. \n\n            However, note: we can also draw two tiles of the same suit and same number? Actually, we can draw arbitrarily.\n\n            Actually, the minimal number of draws might be 2, but we want the minimum. So we are checking 0, then 1, then 2.\n\n        But note: is there a case that requires 3 draws? \n\n        Consider: [1m, 2p, 3s] (three tiles, each different suit and consecutive numbers). Then we cannot form a triplet (different suits) and we cannot form a sequence (different suits). Then we need to draw tiles to create a mentsu.\n\n        We can try to form a triplet: \n            We can draw two more of 1m (then we have [1m,1m,1m] and the other two) -> 2 draws.\n\n        Or form a sequence: \n            We can draw two more in one suit, say m: we need 2m and 3m? Then we have [1m,2m,3m] (sequence) and the other two. -> 2 draws.\n\n        But wait, is there a way to do it in 1 draw? \n            We draw one tile. Then we have four tiles. Now, we need to form a mentsu. \n            The drawn tile must be chosen so that together with two of the existing, we form a mentsu.\n\n            Possibilities for one draw:\n                Triplet: we need to have two of the same tile. Currently, we have three distinct tiles. So unless we draw a tile that is one of the existing, then we will have two of one and one of the others. Then we can form a triplet only if we draw two of the same? Actually, we draw one: then we have one tile duplicated, but that gives two of that tile. Then we can form a triplet by having three of that tile? No, because we have two (from the hand and the drawn) and we need three. So we need two more, but we only drew one. \n\n                Sequence: we need three consecutive in the same suit. We have one tile per suit. Suppose we draw a tile in the m-suit, say 1m (already have one 1m). Then we have two 1m. Then we can form a sequence only if we have two consecutive numbers in the m-suit? But we have only two 1m. We need a sequence of three consecutive. So we need 1m,2m,3m. We have one 1m, then we draw one more 1m (then we have two 1m) and we still don't have 2m and 3m. \n\n                Alternatively, we draw a tile in a new suit? Then we have four suits (if we draw one) but we only have three suits initially. Actually, we have three tiles, each in a different suit. Then drawing one more in one of the suits: say m (for 1m). Then we have two suits with one tile and one suit (m) with two. Then we cannot form a sequence because we don't have three consecutive in any suit.\n\n            Therefore, one draw is not enough.\n\n        Then we need two draws. So the answer for [1m,2p,3s] is 2.\n\n        However, note: we might be able to form a sequence by drawing two tiles in the same suit. For example, draw 2m and 3m. Then we have [1m,2m,3m] (sequence) and the other two tiles (2p,3s). \n\n        But wait, we could also form a triplet by drawing two of 1m (or two of 2p, or two of 3s). \n\n        So the minimal draws is 2.\n\n        But is there a way to do it in 2 draws? Yes.\n\n        Now, what about 3 draws? Actually, we don't need to consider more because we found 2 draws.\n\n        However, note: there is a special case: if we have two tiles that are the same, then we can complete a triplet by drawing one. So we don't need to go to two draws.\n\n        So algorithm:\n\n        Let tiles = list of three strings.\n\n        Step 1: Check for existing mentsu (0 draws)\n\n        Conditions for triplet: \n            Count the frequency of each tile (by string). If any tile appears three times, then triplet.\n\n        Conditions for sequence:\n            We need three tiles that form a consecutive sequence in the same suit.\n\n            Steps for sequence in the initial three:\n                Group by suit. For a given suit, if there are at least three tiles, then check if the numbers are consecutive.\n\n            But note: we have three tiles. So if we have three tiles in the same suit, then we can check if they are consecutive. \n                Sort the numbers: [a, b, c] (a<=b<=c). Then check if b - a == 1 and c - b == 1.\n\n            However, the sequence doesn't require being sorted. But we can sort.\n\n            Example: [5p,7p,6p] -> sorted [5,6,7] -> consecutive.\n\n        But note: the problem says [5p,5s,9m,4p,1s,7p,7m,6p] contains [5p,4p,6p] or [5p,7p,6p]. Actually, wait: [5p,4p,6p] is not consecutive because 4,5,6 is consecutive. But note: the example says [5p,4p,6p] is valid. Actually, the example says [5p,4p,6p] is a shuntsu. But 4,5,6 is consecutive.\n\n        So condition for sequence in a suit: the three numbers must be three consecutive numbers, regardless of order.\n\n        However, we have three tiles. So if we have three tiles in the same suit, we can sort and check.\n\n        But note: we might have more than three tiles in the same suit? Actually, we start with three tiles. So maximum three per suit.\n\n        Step 2: Check for 1 draw.\n\n        Possibility 1: Triplet by drawing one.\n            Condition: There exists a tile (represented by string) that appears at least twice in the current hand. Then we can draw one more to complete a triplet.\n\n        Possibility 2: Sequence by drawing one.\n            We need to check: For each suit, consider the set of numbers present. Then, for each suit, if there are at least two distinct numbers, then we can look for two numbers that are consecutive (difference 1). Then the missing number (the one that completes the sequence) must be between 1 and 9.\n\n            But note: we have three tiles. We might have two tiles in one suit and one in another. Then we can use the two in the same suit to form a sequence by drawing the missing one.\n\n            However, we might have three tiles, but two in one suit and one in another. Then we can also consider the two in the same suit.\n\n            Steps for sequence by one draw:\n                Group the three tiles by suit.\n\n                For each suit, let the set of numbers be S (with size>=2). Then we look for pairs (a, b) in S (with a < b) such that b - a == 1. Then the missing number for the sequence (a-1, a, b) or (a, b, b+1) must be between 1 and 9.\n\n                But note: we can only draw one tile. So we can only complete one of the two possibilities (if both are valid, then one of them is valid).\n\n            However, what if we have two non-consecutive numbers in the same suit? For example, [1m, 3m] and the third tile is in a different suit. Then we cannot form a sequence by drawing one, because we would need two numbers (like 2m) to complete [1m,2m,3m], but we can only draw one.\n\n            But wait, we can also consider: if we have two numbers that are two apart, then we can form a sequence by drawing two numbers (the two in the middle) but that's two draws.\n\n        Step 3: Check for 2 draws.\n\n        Possibility 1: Triplet by drawing two.\n            Condition: There exists a tile that appears at least once. Then we can draw two more of that tile. But note: we can also form a triplet by drawing two of a tile that we have one of.\n\n            However, we don't necessarily need to complete a triplet from an existing tile. But the problem allows drawing any tile. But to minimize, we would choose to complete a triplet from an existing tile if possible.\n\n            But note: we can also form a sequence by drawing two tiles (in the same suit, consecutive). \n\n        Possibility 2: Sequence by drawing two.\n            Condition: There exists a suit and a set of two numbers (or even one number) such that by drawing two tiles we can complete a sequence.\n\n            Example: \n                We have one tile in a suit, say [1m]. Then we can draw 2m and 3m to form [1m,2m,3m]. \n\n                Or we have two tiles that are two apart, say [1m,4m]. Then we can draw 2m and 3m to form [1m,2m,3m,4m] (then we have the sequence [1m,2m,3m]).\n\n            But note: we might have two tiles that are consecutive and then we can draw the next one (so one draw) is already considered.\n\n        However, note: we are only concerned with the minimum. Since we checked 0 and 1, if we haven't found a solution at 0 or 1, then we check 2. And we know that 2 is sufficient because:\n\n        - We can always complete a triplet by drawing two tiles (if we have at least one tile of a kind) OR\n        - We can complete a sequence by drawing two tiles (if we have at least one tile in a suit, then we can form a consecutive triplet by drawing two more).\n\n        Actually, the worst-case scenario is 2 draws.\n\n        Why not 3? Because we can always form a triplet by drawing two tiles (if we have one tile, then we need two more). And similarly, we can form a sequence by drawing two tiles (if we have one tile, then we draw two more consecutive). \n\n        But note: what if we have three tiles that are all different and not helping for a sequence? Then we can draw two tiles to form a triplet (choosing one of the existing tiles and drawing two more) or form a sequence (choosing one of the existing tiles and drawing two more to complete a consecutive set). \n\n        However, we can also consider: what if we have three tiles that are all different and in different suits? Then we cannot form a triplet (unless we draw two of one) and we cannot form a sequence (unless we draw two in one suit). So two draws.\n\n        But wait, is there a scenario that requires 3 draws? \n\n        Let me think: \n          We have three tiles: [1m, 1p, 1s] (all ones but different suits). \n          We cannot form a triplet (because triplet requires same suit) and we cannot form a sequence (different suits). \n          Then we must draw two more of the same suit to complete a triplet (if we choose to form a triplet) OR draw two more in one suit to complete a sequence.\n\n          Example: to form a triplet: we can draw two more 1m -> [1m,1m,1m] (then we have a triplet). \n          Example: to form a sequence: we can draw two more in m: say 2m and 3m -> then we have [1m,2m,3m] (sequence) and the other two ones (p and s) remain.\n\n          So two draws.\n\n        Another example: [1m, 2p, 3s] (as above) -> two draws.\n\n        What about [1m, 9m, 5p]? \n          Check triplet: no duplicates.\n          Check sequence: in m: [1,9] -> not consecutive. In p: [5] -> not enough. \n          Then 1 draw: \n            Triplet: no tile repeated.\n            Sequence: in m: we have two numbers, 1 and 9. They are not consecutive. We cannot complete a sequence by drawing one because we would need to complete either [0,1,2] (invalid) or [8,9,10] (invalid) or [9,10,11] (invalid) or [0,9, something] (no). Actually, the two numbers 1 and 9 are too far apart.\n\n          Then 2 draws: \n            We can draw two 1m to complete a triplet (then we have [1m,1m,1m] and the others) -> two draws.\n\n          Alternatively, we can draw two tiles in m: say 2m and 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] (sequence) and leave 9m and 5p. \n\n          So two draws.\n\n        Now, is there a case that requires 3 draws? \n\n        Consider: [1m, 2m, 4m] (three tiles in the same suit). \n          Already: we have [1,2,4] -> no triplet (only two distinct) and no sequence (not consecutive). \n          One draw: \n            Triplet: we have two 1m? Actually, we have one 1m, one 2m, one 4m. So no duplicate. Then triplet not by one draw.\n            Sequence: we have two consecutive (1 and 2) -> so we can draw 3 to form [1,2,3] (then we have [1m,2m,3m] and 4m). So one draw.\n\n        Now, consider: [1m, 1m, 9m] (two 1m and one 9m). \n          Already: no triplet (we have two 1m, but not three) and no sequence (1 and 9 are not consecutive and we have two 1m so the sequence would require three consecutive, and we have 1m and 9m which are not consecutive).\n          One draw: \n            Triplet: we can draw one more 1m -> then we have three 1m -> triplet. So one draw.\n\n        Another example: [1m, 1m, 2m] -> already we have two 1m and one 2m. Then one draw: \n            Triplet: draw one more 1m -> triplet (three 1m). \n            Sequence: we have 1m and 2m, so we can draw 0m (invalid) or 3m. But we don't need to because we have the triplet option.\n\n        Now, consider a tricky one: [1m, 2m, 1p] \n          Already: no triplet, no sequence (different suits).\n          One draw: \n            Triplet: we have two distinct tiles (1m and 2m) and one p. No duplicates -> cannot complete triplet by one draw.\n            Sequence: in m: we have [1,2] -> consecutive, so we can draw 3m or 0m (0m invalid) -> so we can draw 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] (sequence). So one draw.\n\n        Now, is there any hand that requires 3 draws? \n\n        Example: [1m, 2p, 3s] -> we saw 2 draws.\n\n        Example: [1m, 1m, 1m] -> 0 draws.\n\n        Example: [1m, 1m, 2m] -> 1 draw.\n\n        Example: [1m, 2m, 3m] -> 0 draws.\n\n        Example: [1m, 2m, 4m] -> 1 draw.\n\n        Example: [1m, 9m, 5p] -> 2 draws.\n\n        Example: [1m, 1p, 1s] -> 2 draws.\n\n        Example: [1m, 2p, 4s] -> 2 draws.\n\n        I don't see a case that requires 3 draws. Why?\n\n        Because we can always form a triplet by drawing two tiles (if we have at least one tile, then we can draw two more of that tile). \n\n        However, note: what if we have three tiles that are all different and in the same suit, but not consecutive and we don't have duplicates? \n\n        Example: [1m, 5m, 9m] (three tiles, same suit, distinct, and not consecutive). \n          Already: no triplet (all distinct) and no sequence (not consecutive). \n          One draw: \n            Triplet: no duplicate -> cannot.\n            Sequence: we have three numbers: 1,5,9. We can check for consecutive pairs: \n                Between 1 and 5: gap 4 -> we would need four numbers to fill, but we can only draw one. \n                Between 5 and 9: gap 4 -> same.\n            So one draw fails.\n\n          Two draws: \n            We can complete a triplet by drawing two more of one of the existing. \n                Draw two 1m: then we have [1m,1m,1m] -> triplet.\n                Draw two 5m: then we have [5m,5m,5m] -> triplet.\n                Draw two 9m: then we have [9m,9m,9m] -> triplet.\n\n            Alternatively, we can form a sequence by drawing two more in the same suit. For example, we can complete the sequence [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 2m and 3m. Or [5m,6m,7m] by drawing 6m and 7m. Or [8m,9m,10m] (invalid). \n\n            So two draws.\n\n        Therefore, the maximum we need is 2.\n\n        So the answer can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n        Step 0: Parse the input.\n\n        Step 1: Check if there is already a triplet or a sequence (0 draws).\n\n        Step 2: If not, check if we can form a triplet by drawing one (1 draw): i.e., if there is a tile that appears at least twice.\n\n        Step 3: If not, check if we can form a sequence by drawing one (1 draw): \n            Group by suit. For each suit, if there are at least two distinct numbers, then check for consecutive pairs (with difference 1) and the missing number for the sequence is between 1 and 9.\n\n        Step 4: If not, then the answer is 2.\n\n        However, note: we might have three tiles in the same suit, but we already checked for sequence (0 draws). So if we didn't find a sequence in step1, then the three tiles in the same suit are not consecutive. Then in step3, we check for consecutive pairs (with at least two distinct numbers) and then the missing number must be in [1,9].\n\n        But note: we might have two consecutive numbers and one other number (maybe in the same suit or different). \n\n        Implementation:\n\n        Let tiles = [t1, t2, t3]\n\n        Step 1: Check for triplet (0 draws)\n            from collections import Counter\n            count = Counter(tiles)\n            if any(count[tile] >= 3 for tile in count):\n                print(0)\n                exit(0)\n\n            Check for sequence (0 draws):\n            groups = {}\n            for tile in tiles:\n                suit = tile[1]\n                num = int(tile[0])\n                if suit not in groups:\n                    groups[suit] = []\n                groups[suit].append(num)\n\n            for suit, nums in groups.items():\n                if len(nums) >= 3:\n                    # sort the list\n                    sorted_nums = sorted(set(nums))\n                    if len(sorted_nums) == 3:\n                        if sorted_nums[1] - sorted_nums[0] == 1 and sorted_nums[2] - sorted_nums[1] == 1:\n                            print(0)\n                            exit(0)\n                    # but what if there are duplicates? then set reduces, so if we have duplicates then we cannot form a sequence of three distinct numbers. Actually, we need three distinct consecutive numbers.\n\n            However, note: the definition of sequence: three sequential numbered tiles. They must be distinct. So duplicates don't help.\n\n        But wait, what if we have [1m,2m,2m]? Then in the same suit, we have [1,2,2] -> set becomes [1,2] -> then we don't have three distinct numbers. So we skip.\n\n        Step 2: Check for 1 draw (triplet): \n            if any(count[tile] == 2 for tile in count):\n                print(1)\n                exit(0)\n\n        Step 3: Check for 1 draw (sequence):\n            We need to check for each suit that has at least two distinct numbers. Then, for each suit, we look for two numbers that are consecutive (difference 1) and then check the missing number for the sequence.\n\n            But note: we might have three tiles, so we can have multiple suits. We can also have two tiles in one suit and one in another.\n\n            Steps for a suit:\n                Let S = sorted(set(numbers in this suit))\n                Then, if the suit has at least two numbers, we can check for consecutive pairs.\n\n            However, we can also have two tiles that are consecutive and then the third tile is in a different suit. \n\n            Example: [1m,2m,3p] -> we have two tiles in m: [1,2]. Then we can complete the sequence by drawing 3m (then we have [1m,2m,3m]). \n\n            But note: we can also complete by drawing 0m (invalid) or 4m? Actually, for [1,2] we can draw 0m (invalid) or 3m. \n\n            So condition for a consecutive pair (a, a+1) in the same suit: \n                We can complete the sequence by drawing a-1 (if a-1>=1) OR a+2 (if a+2<=9). \n\n            But note: the consecutive pair (a, a+1) can be part of two different sequences: (a-1, a, a+1) and (a, a+1, a+2).\n\n            However, we don't require the entire hand to be used, so we only need to form one mentsu. \n\n            So if either a-1 is in [1,9] OR a+2 is in [1,9] (but note: a+2 must be <=9) then we can complete a sequence by drawing one.\n\n            But wait, we don't know which one to draw. However, we only need one possibility.\n\n            However, note: we are only allowed to draw one tile. So we can choose either if both are valid.\n\n            But what if the consecutive pair is (1,2): then a-1=0 (invalid) but a+2=3 (valid). So we can draw 3.\n\n            Similarly, (8,9): a-1=7 (valid) and a+2=10 (invalid). So we can draw 7.\n\n            (2,3): both 1 and 4 are valid.\n\n            Therefore, condition for a consecutive pair (a, a+1) in the same suit: \n                if (a-1 >= 1) OR (a+2 <= 9) then we can complete the sequence by drawing one.\n\n            However, note: we don't require the drawn tile to be the only tile we draw, but we are only drawing one. And we don't care about the other tiles.\n\n            But note: we have three tiles. We are using two of them (the consecutive pair) and the third tile is in a different suit (or same suit but not used). \n\n            Steps for sequence by one draw:\n                For each suit, if the suit has at least two distinct numbers, then:\n                    Let the distinct numbers in that suit be L (sorted).\n                    For i in range(len(L)-1):\n                        if L[i+1] - L[i] == 1:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) from her initial three tiles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, we check if the initial three tiles already contain a mentsu. A mentsu can be:\n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles (same number and suit).\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive numbers in the same suit (e.g., 1m, 2m, 3m).\n\n2. **Check for Triplet Completion with One Draw**: If no mentsu exists initially, we check if drawing one tile can complete a triplet. This happens if there are at least two identical tiles in the hand.\n\n3. **Check for Sequence Completion with One Draw**: If no triplet can be completed with one draw, we check if drawing one tile can complete a sequence. This involves finding two tiles in the same suit with consecutive numbers (e.g., 1m and 2m) and verifying that the missing number for a valid sequence (either a-1 or b+1) is within the range 1 to 9.\n\n4. **Default to Two Draws**: If neither of the above conditions is met, then drawing two tiles will always suffice to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) != 3:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    tiles = data\n\n    # Check for existing triplet (koutsu)\n    from collections import Counter\n    count_tiles = Counter(tiles)\n    found_triplet = False\n    for tile, cnt in count_tiles.items():\n        if cnt >= 3:\n            print(0)\n            return\n\n    # Check for existing shuntsu (sequence)\n    groups = {}\n    for tile in tiles:\n        num_char = tile[0]\n        suit = tile[1]\n        num = int(num_char)\n        if suit not in groups:\n            groups[suit] = []\n        groups[suit].append(num)\n\n    found_sequence = False\n    for suit, nums in groups.items():\n        unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))\n        n = len(unique_nums)\n        if n >= 3:\n            if unique_nums[2] - unique_nums[1] == 1 and unique_nums[1] - unique_nums[0] == 1:\n                print(0)\n                return\n        else:\n            if n == 2:\n                a, b = unique_nums\n                if b - a == 1:\n                    found_sequence = True\n                    break\n\n    if found_sequence:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Check for one draw (triplet)\n    for tile, cnt in count_tiles.items():\n        if cnt == 2:\n            print(1)\n            return\n\n    # Check for one draw (shuntsu)\n    for suit, nums in groups.items():\n        unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))\n        n = len(unique_nums)\n        if n < 2:\n            continue\n        for i in range(n - 1):\n            if unique_nums[i+1] - unique_nums[i] == 1:\n                a = unique_nums[i]\n                b = unique_nums[i+1]\n                if a - 1 >= 1:\n                    print(1)\n                    return\n                elif b + 1 <= 9:\n                    print(1)\n                    return\n\n    # Otherwise, two draws are needed.\n    print(2)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check for Mentsu**: The code first checks if the initial three tiles form a triplet or a sequence. If so, it immediately returns 0, indicating no draws are needed.\n2. **Triplet Completion Check**: If no mentsu is found, the code checks if any tile appears at least twice. If so, drawing one more of that tile completes a triplet, and it returns 1.\n3. **Sequence Completion Check**: The code then checks for two tiles in the same suit with consecutive numbers. If the missing number for a valid sequence is within 1 to 9, drawing one tile completes the sequence, and it returns 1.\n4. **Default Case**: If none of the above conditions are met, the code concludes that drawing two tiles will suffice to form either a triplet or a sequence, hence returning 2.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible scenarios to determine the minimal number of draws required, ensuring optimal performance with a clear and logical structure.",
