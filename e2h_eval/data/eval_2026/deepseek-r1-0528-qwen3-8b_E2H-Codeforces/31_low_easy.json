Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards)\n We can use any number of additional cards, each with an integer from -x to x (excluding 0? Actually including 0? But note: the problem says \"each card\" doesn't exceed x in absolute value, so from -x to x inclusive.\n\n However, note that we are allowed to choose any number of cards (from the infinite set) as long as each card's absolute value <= x.\n\n The goal is to make the sum of all cards (found and added) equal to zero, by adding the minimum number of cards.\n\n Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n Then, we need to add some cards (each card is an integer between -x and x) such that the total sum is 0.\n\n Therefore, we need to cover the deficit (if S is positive, we need negative numbers; if S is negative, we need positive numbers) and also we can use zeros if needed, but zeros don't help. So we are interested in the absolute value.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to use multiple cards. The problem is to find the minimum number of cards to add.\n\n Observation:\n Let d = |S|. We need to achieve a total sum of 0, meaning we must add cards whose sum is -S (which is d).\n\n But note: we can use negative or positive cards arbitrarily. However, we are constrained by the fact that each card's absolute value is at most x.\n\n We can think of it as: we want to cover the deficit d (which is nonnegative) using the fewest number of cards, each of which can contribute at most x (in absolute value). However, note that:\n\n Case 1: If d == 0, then we don't need to add any card.\n\n Case 2: Otherwise, we have two ways: we can use negative cards (if S is positive) or positive cards (if S is negative). Without loss of generality, let's assume we are covering a positive deficit d (if S is negative, we can flip the signs and consider covering a positive deficit). \n\n However, note: we can also use a mix of positive and negative? Actually, wait: the deficit is defined by the absolute value. But actually, we are allowed to use both positive and negative? However, if we have to cover a deficit of +d (meaning we need to add negative cards that sum to -d) then we can only use negative cards. Similarly, if we have a deficit of -d (meaning we need to add positive cards that sum to +d) then we use positive cards.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that we use only negative or only positive. However, observe: if we have a deficit of +d (i.e., we are short by d), then adding a positive card would actually increase the total sum (making the deficit even larger) and then we would have to compensate more. So we must use negative cards to reduce the sum.\n\n Similarly, if we have a deficit of -d (i.e., the current sum is too low by d, so we need to add positive cards) then we use positive cards.\n\n However, wait: what if we have a deficit of +d and we use one negative card of value -a (with a <= x) and one positive card of value b (with b<=x)? Then the net change is -a + b. We require that -a+b = -d. But note, we are trying to fix the total sum from S to 0. The initial deficit is d = S (if S is positive). Then we require the added cards to sum to -S = -d. \n\n Actually, we can use any combination of positive and negative. However, note that the condition on each card is |card|<=x.\n\n But observe: we are free to choose the sign of each card arbitrarily. However, we are constrained by the maximum absolute value. The goal is to minimize the number of cards.\n\n However, there is a catch: we cannot exceed the deficit by too much and then have to fix it again. Actually, the problem is simpler because we are only concerned with the total sum. We can use any set of cards (positive and negative) as long as the total sum of the added cards is -S.\n\n But note: we might overshoot the deficit? Actually, no: we are allowed to use any integers between -x and x. However, the minimal number of cards will be achieved by making each card as large as possible in magnitude (but same sign) to cancel the deficit.\n\n However, wait: we can use both positive and negative to cancel the deficit? Let me clarify:\n\n Example: deficit d=5, x=3. \n   Option 1: Use two cards: one -3 and one -2 -> total -5. That's two cards.\n   Option 2:",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards equals zero. Each card's number must be an integer between -x and x, inclusive. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the sum of the found cards must be balanced by the sum of the additional cards. Let the current sum of the found cards be `S`. The additional cards must sum to `-S` (the deficit). The challenge is to cover this deficit with the fewest cards, each contributing at most `x` in absolute value.\n\n2. **Intuition**: \n   - If the current sum `S` is already zero, no additional cards are needed.\n   - Otherwise, the deficit `d = abs(S)` must be covered by adding cards. The minimal number of cards required is determined by how much each card can contribute towards reducing the deficit. Each card can contribute up to `x` in magnitude (either positive or negative, depending on the deficit direction).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - Calculate the absolute value of the current sum `d`.\n   - If `d` is zero, the answer is zero.\n   - Otherwise, the minimal number of cards needed is the ceiling of `d / x`, because each card can reduce the deficit by at most `x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total = sum(cards)\n    d = abs(total)\n    \n    if d == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = d // x\n        if d % x != 0:\n            k += 1\n        print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of a card), followed by `n` integers representing the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the found cards. The absolute value of this sum (`d`) gives the deficit that needs to be covered by additional cards.\n3. **Handling Zero Deficit**: If the deficit `d` is zero, output `0` since no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Calculating Minimum Cards**: For a non-zero deficit, the minimum number of cards required is the ceiling of `d / x`. This is because each card can contribute up to `x` towards reducing the deficit. If `d` is not perfectly divisible by `x`, an additional card is needed to cover the remaining deficit.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging basic arithmetic operations and ensures optimal performance with a constant time complexity for the calculations after reading the input.",
