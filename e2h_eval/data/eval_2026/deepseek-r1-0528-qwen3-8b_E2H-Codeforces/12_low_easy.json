The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the task locations)\n Since the ringroad is circular and we can only move clockwise, note that moving from house x to house y:\n   If x <= y: then the distance is y - x.\n   If x > y: then we have to go from x to the end (n) and then from 1 to y: so (n - x + y)\n\n However, note that Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order.\n\n But note: the problem says she must complete all tasks with numbers less than i before the i-th. So the order is fixed.\n\n We can think of it as: \n   Start at house 1.\n   Then for each task i (from first to last), we need to go from the previous task's house to the current task's house.\n\n However, there is a catch: the ringroad is circular and we are moving only clockwise.\n\n Let's denote the sequence of tasks by an array A[0..m-1] (each element is an integer between 1 and n).\n\n The total time will be the sum of the distances between consecutive positions (including the start at 1 and the first task, then between tasks).\n\n Steps:\n   Let current = 1 (starting house)\n   Then for each task location a_i (from i=0 to m-1):\n        distance = min_distance(current, a_i)   [but note: only clockwise movement, so we cannot use the direct linear way if it's circular?]\n\n Actually, because we can only move clockwise, the distance from current to a_i is:\n        If a_i >= current: then distance = a_i - current\n        Else: then distance = (n - current + a_i)\n\n However, note that the problem does not require us to consider multiple paths (only clockwise). So the above formula is correct.\n\n But wait: what if we are at house 4 and n=4, and we want to go to house 1? Then:\n        a_i = 1, current=4 -> since 1 < 4, then distance = (4-4+1) = 1? Actually, that is correct because from 4 we go to 1 (next in circle) and that is one step.\n\n However, note the example: \n        Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n\n        Steps:\n          Start at 1.\n          First task: 3 -> from 1 to 3: 3-1 = 2 units.\n          Then from 3 to 2: 2<3 -> (4-3+2) = 1+2 = 3 units? But wait, the example says the moves are: 1->2->3->4->1->2->3. That is 6 units.\n\n        Actually, let's break down the example:\n\n          Start at 1.\n          Then to do the first task at 3: we move 1->2->3 (2 units).\n          Then from 3 to 2: but we can only move clockwise, so we must go 3->4->1->2 (which is 3 units: 3->4 (1), 4->1 (2nd), 1->2 (3rd)).\n          Then from 2 to 3: 2->3 (1 unit).\n\n          Total: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the steps between tasks:\n\n          Step1: from 1 to 3: 2\n          Step2: from 3 to 2: (n - 3 + 2) = 4-3+2 = 3\n          Step3: from 2 to 3: 1\n\n        So the total is 6.\n\n        Another example: \n          Input: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n\n          Start at 1.\n          First task: 2 -> from 1 to 2: 1 unit.\n          Second task: 3 -> from 2 to 3: 1 unit.\n          Third task: 3 -> from 3 to 3: 0.\n\n          Total: 1 + 1 + 0 = 2.\n\n        This matches the second example.\n\n Therefore, we can compute the total time by:\n\n        total_time = 0\n        current = 1\n        for each task_location in the list of m integers:\n            if task_location >= current:\n                d = task_location - current\n            else:\n                d = n - current + task_location\n\n            total_time += d\n            current = task_location\n\n But wait, is that always optimal? \n\n However, note that the problem states that Xenia must complete the tasks in the given order and that the movement is only clockwise. \n There is no alternative path (like going",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad in a clockwise direction. The key observation here is that Xenia can only move clockwise, so the distance between two houses is calculated based on their positions in the circular arrangement.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in a specified order. Each task requires her to be at a particular house. The movement is restricted to clockwise direction, meaning she can only move forward in the ring. The challenge is to compute the minimal time required to visit each task location in sequence, considering the circular nature of the ringroad.\n2. **Insight**: The distance between two houses `current` and `target` can be calculated as:\n   - If `target` is greater than or equal to `current`, the distance is simply `target - current`.\n   - If `target` is less than `current`, the distance is `(n - current + target)`, accounting for the circular wrap-around from the end of the ring to the beginning.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate through each task location, compute the distance from the current position to the next task location using the above logic, accumulate the total time, and update the current position to the task's location after each move.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each task exactly once, resulting in a linear time complexity of O(m), where m is the number of tasks. This is efficient given the constraints (m ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    total_time = 0\n    current = 1\n    \n    for a in tasks:\n        if a >= current:\n            total_time += (a - current)\n        else:\n            total_time += (n - current + a)\n        current = a\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The code reads the input values for the number of houses `n`, the number of tasks `m`, and the list of task locations.\n- **Processing Tasks**: For each task location, it calculates the distance from the current position (initially house 1) to the task's house. If the task's house is ahead in the clockwise direction, the distance is straightforward. Otherwise, it accounts for the circular path by wrapping around from the end of the ring to the beginning.\n- **Accumulating Time**: The computed distance for each move is added to the total time, and the current position is updated to the task's house.\n- **Output**: After processing all tasks, the total accumulated time is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal time by leveraging the circular nature of the ringroad and ensures optimal performance with a linear pass through the task list.",
