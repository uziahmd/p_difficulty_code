In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three tiles. Each tile is a string of two characters: first digit (from '1' to '9') and second character one of 'm', 'p', 's'.\n\n We can draw any number of tiles (each draw adds one tile). We want the minimum number of draws so that in the hand (original plus drawn) there exists at least one mentsu (which is either a koutsu or a shuntsu).\n\n Note: The entire hand doesn't need to form a complete winning hand (which typically requires 14 tiles), only that there is at least one mentsu (a triplet or a sequence of three) present.\n\n Since we start with three tiles, we might have:\n\n Case 0: Already have a mentsu -> then answer is 0.\n\n But note: the problem says she has three tiles initially. After drawing, the hand grows. However, we are allowed to draw any tiles arbitrarily (including duplicates). We are to find the minimum number of draws so that there is at least one mentsu.\n\n However, note: sometimes we don't need to wait for three identical ones or a consecutive sequence. We are only required to have one mentsu (three tiles). But we can also use the same tile in multiple ways? Actually, no: each tile is distinct. But note: we can draw duplicates. So we can duplicate existing tiles.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Possibilities:\n\n 1. Check if the current three tiles form a koutsu or a shuntsu.\n\n   - Koutsu: all three tiles are the same (same digit and same suit). Example: ['1m','1m','1m'].\n\n   - Shuntsu: three consecutive numbers (differing by 1) in the same suit. Example: ['1m','2m','3m'].\n\n 2. If yes, then 0 draws.\n\n 3. Otherwise, we consider drawing 1, 2, or more tiles. However, note:\n\n   With one draw: We can add one tile and then check if we have a mentsu.\n\n   But note: we are not required to use all the tiles. However, the problem states that she has three tiles initially and then draws some. Then, the hand must contain at least one mentsu (three tiles). The mentsu might be formed by the original three plus some drawn ones? Or it could be that the drawn ones are used to complete a mentsu that uses two of the original?\n\n   Actually, the problem does not require the entire hand to be a winning hand, just that there is at least one mentsu (so three tiles that form either a triplet or a sequence). We can ignore the other tiles? But note: we are only concerned with the existence of one mentsu.\n\n   However, we are allowed to draw as many as we want. But we want the minimum.\n\n   Let's think about the possibilities:\n\n   Option A: Draw 0 -> already done.\n\n   Option B: Draw 1 -> then we have four tiles. We can form a mentsu with three of them.\n\n   How?\n\n   For koutsu: \n      We might have two of the same tile. Then we draw one more of that tile -> then we have three of that tile.\n\n   For shuntsu:\n      We might have two tiles that are part of a shuntsu. For example, we have [1m, 2m] and then we draw 3m -> then we have [1m,2m,3m]. Similarly, we might have [2m,3m] and draw 1m or 4m? Actually, wait: the sequence must be consecutive. But note: the example [5s,7s,6s] is valid because order doesn't matter. So we can have [1m,3m] and then drawing 2m gives [1m,2m,3m]. Or we might have [2m,2m] and then drawing 1m and 3m? But wait, we are only drawing one tile. \n\n   Actually, with one tile we can only fix one gap.\n\n   However, note: we are not limited to using the original three. But wait, we are only allowed to draw one tile. So we have four tiles: the original three and one new.\n\n   How can we form a mentsu with three tiles from these four?\n\n   There are two possibilities:\n\n   Possibility 1: The three tiles are a koutsu. Then we need to have three copies of a tile. If we have two copies of a tile, then drawing one more gives three copies. But note: we start with three distinct tiles? Not necessarily. The input has three tiles, but they might be repeated.\n\n   Example: Input ['1m','1m','2m'] -> then we have two",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that her hand contains at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, we check if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu. A koutsu (triplet) is when all three tiles are identical. A shuntsu (sequence) is when the three tiles have consecutive numbers and the same suit.\n2. **Check for One Draw**: If no mentsu exists initially, we check if drawing one tile can form a mentsu. This involves:\n   - **Koutsu Check**: If there are two identical tiles, drawing one more of the same tile forms a triplet.\n   - **Shuntsu Check**: If two tiles can be part of a sequence (e.g., [1m, 2m] can form a sequence with 3m), then drawing one tile completes the sequence.\n3. **Check for Two Draws**: If one draw is insufficient, we check if two draws can form a mentsu. This involves either forming a triplet (three identical tiles) or completing a sequence (two consecutive tiles in the same suit).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    if len(data) != 3:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    tiles = [tuple(tile) for tile in data]\n    \n    # Check for existing koutsu or shuntsu\n    has_koutsu = False\n    has_shuntsu = False\n    \n    # Check for koutsu: all three tiles are the same\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        has_koutsu = True\n        \n    # Check for shuntsu: three consecutive numbers in the same suit\n    def can_form_shuntsu(tiles):\n        suits = set(tile[1] for tile in tiles)\n        if len(suits) != 1:\n            return False\n            \n        nums = sorted(int(tile[0]) for tile in tiles)\n        if len(set(nums)) != 3:\n            return False\n            \n        return nums[2] - nums[0] == 2 and nums[1] - nums[0] == 1\n            \n    if can_form_shuntsu(tiles):\n        has_shuntsu = True\n        \n    if has_koutsu or has_shuntsu:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    # Check for one draw\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    count_tiles = defaultdict(int)\n    for tile in tiles:\n        count_tiles[tile] += 1\n        \n    # Check for koutsu with one draw: if any tile appears twice, drawing one more makes triplet\n    if any(count == 2 for count in count_tiles.values()):\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    # Check for shuntsu with one draw: look for two tiles that can form a sequence with one missing\n    suits = set(tile[1] for tile in tiles)\n    for suit in suits:\n        suit_tiles = [int(tile[0]) for tile in tiles if tile[1] == suit]\n        unique_suit_tiles = set(suit_tiles)\n        for num in range(1, 10):\n            if num in unique_suit_tiles:\n                next_num = num + 1\n                prev_num = num - 1\n                if next_num in unique_suit_tiles:\n                    if prev_num in unique_suit_tiles:\n                        print(1)\n                        return\n                    else:\n                        print(1)\n                        return\n            else:\n                continue\n        else:\n            continue\n    else:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n        \n    # If not found, check for two draws\n    # Option 1: Draw two tiles to form a koutsu (three of a kind)\n    if any(count == 1 for count in count_tiles.values()):\n        print(2)\n        return\n        \n    # Option 2: Draw two tiles to form a shuntsu (sequence)\n    for suit in suits:\n        suit_tiles = [int(tile[0]) for tile in tiles if tile[1] == suit]\n        unique_suit_tiles = set(suit_tiles)\n        for num in range(1, 9):\n            if num in unique_suit_tiles and num+1 in unique_suit_tiles and num+2 in unique_suit_tiles:\n                print(2)\n                return\n                \n    print(2)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: The code first checks if the three tiles already form a koutsu (all identical) or a shuntsu (three consecutive numbers in the same suit). If so, it immediately returns 0.\n2. **One Draw Check**: If no mentsu exists, the code checks if drawing one tile can form a mentsu. This involves checking for two identical tiles (for a potential koutsu) or two tiles that can form a sequence with one missing tile (for a potential shuntsu).\n3. **Two Draws Check**: If one draw is insufficient, the code checks if two draws can form a mentsu. This includes forming a triplet by drawing two more of a single tile or completing a sequence by drawing two specific tiles.\n4. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles edge cases where no mentsu can be formed even after two draws, though the problem guarantees a solution exists within these constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible scenarios to determine the minimal number of draws required, ensuring optimal performance for the given problem constraints.",
