Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem:\n\n Vanya has found n cards, and he wants to find the minimum number of additional cards so that the sum of all his cards is zero.\n\n Initially, he had infinitely many cards with every integer from -x to x. Now, he has found n cards (each between -x and x). We can assume that we have an infinite supply of any integer in [-x, x] for the remaining cards.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Let S be the sum of the found n cards.\n 2. We need to achieve a total sum of 0, so we need to add a set of cards (with numbers in [-x, x]) such that their total sum is -S.\n\n 3. We want the minimum number of cards to add.\n\n Observation:\n\n Since we can choose any card with value in [-x, x], the maximum absolute value we can cover per card is x.\n\n However, note that we are allowed to use any integer in the range. The goal is to minimize the number of cards.\n\n We can think of it as: what is the smallest k (nonnegative integer) such that there exists a sequence of k integers (each in [-x, x]) whose sum is -S?\n\n But note: the problem does not require distinct cards, so we can use the same card multiple times.\n\n However, we must also consider: we are only allowed to use numbers with absolute value at most x.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Let T = -S (the target sum we need to achieve with the additional cards).\n\n We are to cover T with the fewest number of cards, each card being in the range [-x, x].\n\n Note: The minimal number of cards cannot be less than ceil(|T| / x) if T != 0, but wait: we can use negative and positive numbers arbitrarily (as long as |card|<=x). Actually, the key is:\n\n - If T is 0, then we don't need any card.\n\n - Otherwise, we can use positive and negative numbers.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that we use only one sign. We can mix.\n\n But observe: the best way to minimize the number of cards is to use the largest absolute value (i.e., x) as much as possible.\n\n However, we can also use negative numbers. So the problem reduces to: given T, what is the minimum k such that there exist integers a1, a2, ..., ak (each in [-x, x]) and the sum of ai is T.\n\n This is equivalent to: we can represent T as a linear combination of k steps, where each step is between -x and x.\n\n But note: we are allowed to use any integer in that range. The minimal k is:\n\n  - If T == 0: k=0.\n\n  - Else, we can use the following idea:\n\n    We are allowed to use numbers up to x (and down to -x). So the maximum absolute sum we can get with k cards is k*x.\n\n    However, we can also mix positive and negative. But note that we don't necessarily have to use the entire range. \n\n    Actually, we can use the following:\n\n    Consider: with k cards, the minimum sum we can form is -k*x and the maximum is k*x.\n\n    Therefore, if |T| <= k*x, then we can form T? Not exactly: because we have integer constraints and the fact that we can choose any integer in the range.\n\n    However, note: we are allowed to choose any integer, so the set of sums we can form with k cards is every integer between -k*x and k*x that is congruent modulo 1 to ... actually, since we can choose any integer, the set of achievable sums is all integers between -k*x and k*x? \n\n    Wait, no: for example, with k=1, we can form every integer from -x to x. With k=2, we can form every integer from -2x to 2x? Actually, yes, because we can choose two arbitrary integers (each from -x to x) and the sum is an integer and the range is continuous in the sense that the step is 1. \n\n    However, wait: if we have two cards, the smallest sum is -2x and the largest is 2x, and we can indeed get every integer in between? \n\n    Example: x=2, k=2. Then the possible sums are from -4 to 4. Can we get every integer?\n        -4: (-2,-2)\n        -3: (-2,-1)\n        -2: (-2,0) or (-1,-1)\n        -1: (-2,1) -> wait, that gives 1-2=-1. Actually, yes. Similarly, 5? No, because maximum is 4.\n\n    So the set of achievable sums with k cards is every integer between -k*x and k*x? \n\n    Actually, no. Consider x=1, k=2: the possible sums are from -2 to 2, and we can get every integer in between? \n        -2: (-1,-1)\n        -1: (-1,0) or (0,-1) etc.\n        0: (0,0) or (1,-1)\n        1: (1,0)\n        2: (1,1)\n\n    So yes, we can get every integer from -k*x to k*x.\n\n    Therefore, the condition for k to be sufficient is that |T| <= k*x.\n\n    Then the minimal k is the smallest nonnegative integer such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n    But wait, what if T is positive? Then we need to form T, and k_min = ceil(T/x). Similarly, if T is negative, same thing.\n\n    However, note: k must be an integer, so k_min = ceil(|T|/x) ?\n\n    Example: \n        Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> n=3, x=2, cards = [-1,1,2]. Sum S = -1+1+2 = 2. Then T = -2 (because we need to make the total zero, so the added cards must sum to -2).\n\n        Then |T| = 2. Then k_min = ceil(2/2) = ceil(1) = 1.\n\n        Another example: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> n=2, x=3, cards = [-2,-2]. Sum S = -4. T = 4.\n\n        Then k_min = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.33) = 2.\n\n    But wait, is that always sufficient? \n\n    However, note that we can also use negative and positive numbers. But the above reasoning says: we can form any integer in the range [-k*x, k*x] with k cards. So if |T| <= k*x, then we can form T.\n\n    Therefore, the minimal k is the smallest integer k>=0 such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n    So k_min = ceil(|T| / x) if |T| > 0, and 0 if |T|==0.\n\n    However, let's test with a sample: \n        Example 1: T=-2, x=2 -> k_min = ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1 -> correct.\n\n        Example 2: T=4, x=3 -> ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2 -> correct.\n\n    But wait, what if T is not divisible by the gcd? Actually, note: we are allowed to use any integer in [-x,x]. The gcd of the set of available numbers is 1 (since we have consecutive integers? Actually, we have all integers from -x to x, so the gcd of the set is 1). Therefore, by the coin problem, we can form any sufficiently large enough integer (but here we are forming T with k cards, and the set of available numbers is symmetric and includes 0 and ±1, so we can form any integer in the range [-k*x, k*x] without gaps). \n\n    However, note: the coin problem usually considers positive coins, but we have both positive and negative. And the set of numbers we have is symmetric. Moreover, we have consecutive integers? Actually, we have all integers from -x to x. So the set of numbers includes 1 (if x>=1) and -1, so we can form any integer in the range.\n\n    Therefore, the answer is: the minimal k is the smallest integer k (nonnegative) such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n    But note: k is an integer, so we can compute:\n\n        k_min = 0 if T==0\n        else: k_min = (abs(T) + x - 1) // x   [ceiling division]\n\n    However, wait: if T is 0, then we don't need any card.\n\n    Alternatively, we can write:\n\n        k_min = ceil(|T| / x)\n\n    But note: when |T| is 0, then ceil(0/x)=0.\n\n    However, there's a catch: what if we have negative T? The absolute value takes care of that.\n\n    So algorithm:\n\n        Step 1: Read n and x.\n        Step 2: Read the list of n integers.\n        Step 3: Compute S = sum(list)\n        Step 4: T = -S\n\n        Step 5: If T == 0, then print 0.\n        Step 6: Else, compute k_min = ceil(|T| / x)\n\n    But wait, is this always correct?\n\n    Let me test with another example: \n        Suppose we have two cards: [1, 1] and x=1. Then S=2, T=-2. Then k_min = ceil(2/1)=ceil(2)=2. \n        But can we do it with 2 cards? Yes: two cards of -1.\n\n    Another test: [1,1] and x=2. Then T=-2, and ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1. So we need only one card: which must be -2. But wait, the absolute value condition: the card must be in [-2,2] and -2 is allowed. So one card is enough.\n\n    But what if T=3 and x=2? Then k_min = ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2. With two cards, the maximum absolute sum is 4, and we need to form 3. We can use two cards: 2 and 1 -> 3. Or even two cards: 2 and 2 would be 4, but we don't need 4, we need 3. But wait, we can use 2 and 1, and 1 is in the range [0,2] (if x=2, then 1 is allowed). So yes.\n\n    However, note: the cards we choose can be any integer in [-x, x]. So for T=3 and x=2, we can use 2 and 1 (both in [-2,2]). \n\n    But wait, what if T=3 and x=1? Then we can only use cards with values in [-1,1]. Then the maximum positive sum we can get with k cards is k (using 1 each). So we need k>=3. Then k_min = ceil(3/1)=3.\n\n    So the formula holds.\n\n    However, wait: what if T is negative? The same because we use absolute value.\n\n    But wait, what if T is positive? Then we can use positive cards to reach T, and if T is negative we can use negative cards. The absolute value ensures that we consider the magnitude.\n\n    Therefore, the answer is:\n\n        k_min = 0 if T==0\n        else: k_min = ceil(|T| / x)\n\n    But wait, there's an alternative: what if we don't have to use the same sign? Actually, the above reasoning holds because the set of achievable sums is symmetric and contiguous.\n\n    However, note: the problem statement example: \n        Input: ['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n    But wait, there's a catch: the problem says that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x. So we can use any integer in [-x, x] arbitrarily many times.\n\n    Therefore, the solution is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        total_sum = sum(cards)\n        T = -total_sum\n\n        if T == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # We need the smallest k such that k*x >= abs(T)\n            # This is equivalent to k >= ceil(|T| / x)\n            k = abs(T) // x\n            if abs(T) % x != 0:\n                k += 1\n            print(k)\n\n    However, let's test with the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: n=3, x=2, cards = [-1,1,2] -> total_sum = 2, T=-2 -> |T|=2, then 2//2=1, remainder 0 -> k=1. Correct.\n\n        Example 2: n=2, x=3, cards = [-2,-2] -> total_sum=-4, T=4 -> |T|=4, then 4//3=1, remainder 1 -> k=2. Correct.\n\n    But wait, what if T=1 and x=10? Then k=ceil(1/10)=1. But 1 is in [-10,10], so one card of 1 suffices. Correct.\n\n    What if T=0? Then we print 0.\n\n    However, note: the problem says \"minimum number of cards\". We are assuming that we can use any integer in [-x, x]. \n\n    But wait, there is an alternative: sometimes we might be able to use fewer cards by using a mix of positive and negative? \n\n    Let me reconsider: the above reasoning was that the set of achievable sums with k cards is every integer between -k*x and k*x. That means that the minimal k must satisfy k*x >= |T|, and then we can form T. \n\n    However, note: we are allowed to use negative and positive arbitrarily. But the minimal k is determined by the absolute value requirement: we must cover |T| in magnitude, and each card can contribute at most x (in absolute value). So the minimal k is indeed ceil(|T| / x).\n\n    Therefore, the code is:\n\n        Read n and x.\n        Read the list of n integers.\n        total_sum = sum(list)\n        T = -total_sum\n\n        if T == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            k = abs(T) / x\n            # Since k must be an integer, we take the ceiling.\n            # Using integer arithmetic: \n            k_min = (abs(T) + x - 1) // x   # This is ceiling division for positive integers.\n\n            # But note: if abs(T) is 0, then T=0 and we already handled that.\n\n            print(k_min)\n\n    However, wait: the ceiling of a/b for positive integers a and b can be done by (a + b - 1) // b.\n\n    But let's test: \n        a = 2, b=2 -> (2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 -> correct.\n        a = 4, b=3 -> (4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3=2 -> correct.\n\n    So we can use that.\n\n    But note: if T is negative, we take absolute value so it's positive.\n\n    Code:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        t = -s\n        if t == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # We are going to compute ceil(|t| / x)\n            num = abs(t)\n            # Ceiling division: (num + x - 1) // x\n            k = (num + x - 1) // x\n            print(k)\n\n    However, wait: what if the total_sum is very large? But note: the initial n is at most 1000, and each card is at most x (which is at most 1000) in absolute value, so the maximum absolute value of the sum is 1000 * 1000 = 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n    But wait, there's a nuance: the problem says that the numbers on the found cards do not exceed x in absolute value, and n is at most 1000. So the sum can be as large as 1000*x (which is 1000*1000=1000000) and as low as -1000000.\n\n    However, our method uses absolute value and then ceiling division, which is efficient.\n\n    Let me test with a large number: say n=1000, x=1000, and all cards are 1000. Then total_sum = 1000*1000 = 1000000, so T = -1000000. Then k = ceil(1000000/1000)=ceil(1000)=1000.\n\n    But wait, can we cover -1000000 with 1000 cards? Each card can be at most -1000, so 1000 cards can give -1000*1000 = -1000000. So yes, exactly 1000 cards.\n\n    Another test: n=1000, x=1000, and all cards are 1. Then total_sum=1000, T=-1000. Then k = ceil(1000/1000)=1. But wait, we can use one card of -1000 to get -1000? No, because we are allowed to use any card in [-1000,1000]. So yes, one card of -1000 is enough. But wait, the total_sum is 1000, so we need to add -1000. One card of -1000 is allowed. So that's correct.\n\n    However, wait: what if the total_sum is 1000 and x=1? Then we need to form -1000. Then k_min = ceil(1000/1)=1000. And indeed, we can only use cards of -1 (if x=1, then the card must be in [-1,1]). Then we need 1000 cards of -1 to get -1000.\n\n    So the formula holds.\n\n    But wait, what if the total_sum is 1000 and x=2? Then we can use one card of -1000? No, because x=2, so the card must be between -2 and 2. Then we cannot use -1000. Then how do we form -1000? We need to use multiple cards. The minimal k is ceil(1000/2)=500. Then 500 cards of -2 would give -1000.\n\n    So the formula still holds.\n\n    Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        t = -s\n        if t == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            k = (abs(t) + x - 1) // x\n            print(k)\n\n    However, wait: is there any case where we might need more than ceil(|t|/x) because of the integer constraint? \n\n    Let me think: we can form any integer in the range [-k*x, k*x] with k cards. So if |t| <= k*x, we can form t. And we are taking the smallest k such that k*x >= |t|. So that k is the minimal.\n\n    But wait: what if |t| is not divisible by x? For example, |t|=3, x=2: then k_min = ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2. With 2 cards, we can form 3? Because 2+1=3, and both 2 and 1 are in [-2,2]. So yes.\n\n    The key is that the set of achievable sums is contiguous. So we don't have gaps.\n\n    Therefore, the above code should work.\n\n    However, wait: the problem statement example outputs are:\n\n        Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> Output: 1\n        Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> Output: 2\n\n    Our code produces these outputs.\n\n    But wait, there's another sample: \n        Input: \"1 1\\n0\" -> n=1, x=1, card=[0]. Then total_sum=0, so T=0 -> output 0. Correct.\n\n    Another sample: \n        Input: \"1 10\\n5\" -> total_sum=5, T=-5. Then k_min = ceil(5/10)=1. Correct.\n\n    However, wait: the problem says that the found cards have numbers that do not exceed x in absolute value. But the additional cards can be any integer in [-x, x]. \n\n    So the code is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        t = -s\n        if t == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # Compute the absolute value of t\n            abs_t = abs(t)\n            # Ceiling division: (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n            k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n            print(k)\n\n    But wait, what if t is negative? We take absolute value, so that's handled.\n\n    However, wait: what if t is positive? Same.\n\n    One more edge: what if the required t is 0? Then we don't enter the else branch.\n\n    Let me run the code with the provided examples.\n\n    Example 1: \n        Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n        n=3, x=2, arr=[-1,1,2] -> s=2, t=-2 -> abs_t=2 -> k=(2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 (since 3//2 is 1 in integer division). Print 1.\n\n    Example 2:\n        Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n        n=2, x=3, arr=[-2,-2] -> s=-4, t=4 -> abs_t=4 -> k=(4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3=2. Print 2.\n\n    It matches.\n\n    But wait, consider the example: \n        Input: \"1 5\\n3\" -> total_sum=3, t=-3. Then k_min = ceil(3/5)=ceil(0.6)=1. So one card: we need to form -3. Since x=5, we can use a card of -3 (because | -3 |<=5). So one card is enough.\n\n    Another example: \n        Input: \"1 5\\n4\" -> t=-4, then k_min=ceil(4/5)=1. We can use -4, so one card.\n\n    But what about: \n        Input: \"1 5\\n6\" -> wait, the found cards: the input says the numbers do not exceed x in absolute value. In this case, the found card is 6, but x=5, so the input guarantee is broken? \n\n    The problem states: \"The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\"\n\n    So we don't have to worry about numbers beyond x in the found cards.\n\n    Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n    However, wait: there's an alternative scenario. What if the minimal k is not just ceil(|T|/x)? \n\n    Consider: we are allowed to use any integers in [-x, x]. The minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |T|, because the maximum absolute value we can cover per card is x. \n\n    But wait, what if we can use negative and positive arbitrarily? Then the minimal k is indeed the ceiling of |T|/x.\n\n    Therefore, we are confident.\n\n    Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n    However, note: the problem statement says that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x. So we can use any integer in that range arbitrarily many times.\n\n    Code:\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n        if not data:\n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n\n        n = int(data[0])\n        x = int(data[1])\n        # The next n integers\n        arr = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n\n        total_sum = sum(arr)\n        t = -total_sum\n\n        if t == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            abs_t = abs(t)\n            # Calculate k_min = ceil(abs_t / x)\n            # Using integer arithmetic: (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n            k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n            print(k)\n\n    But wait, wait: what if T is negative? The absolute value is taken, so it's positive.\n\n    However, wait: there's a different way to look at it. The minimal number of cards must be at least ceil(|T|/x). But is it possible that we can form T with fewer than ceil(|T|/x) cards? \n\n    Example: T=5, x=3. Then ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2. But can we form 5 with 1 card? The maximum positive card is 3, so no. With 2 cards: maximum is 6, and we can form 5: 3+2=5. So 2 is minimal.\n\n    But what if T=5, x=4? Then ceil(5/4)=ceil(1.25)=2. With 2 cards: maximum is 8, and we can form 5: 4+1=5. So 2.\n\n    What if T=5, x=6? Then ceil(5/6)=1. Then one card: we can use 5 (since 5<=6) so one card.\n\n    So the formula is correct.\n\n    However, wait: what if T is negative? Example: T=-5, x=3. Then ceil(|-5|/3)=ceil(5/3)=2. With two cards: we can form -5: -3-2=-5. So yes.\n\n    Therefore, the solution is as above.\n\n    But wait, I just thought: what if T=0? Then we don't need any card, so 0. Correct.\n\n    There's one more thing: the problem says \"minimum number of cards\", and we are only considering the absolute value. However, note that we can also use negative cards to cancel a positive sum, and positive cards to cancel a negative sum.\n\n    The formula is independent of the sign because we take absolute value.\n\n    Therefore, we are good.\n\n    Let me submit the code.\n\n    However, wait: there's a sample from the problem: \n        Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> Output: 1\n        Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> Output: 2\n\n    And our code produces these.\n\n    But wait, the problem says: \"Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2\" for the first sample. Why is that the minimal? Because the current sum is 2, so we need to add -2. And -2 is within [-2,2] (x=2). So one card.\n\n    And for the second sample: the current sum is -4, so we need to add 4. The maximum absolute value for a card is 3, so we cannot use one card (because the maximum positive card is 3, and 3<4). So we need two cards: 3+1=4? But wait, we can use two cards of 2? But wait, the card must be in [-3,3]. 2 is allowed. Then two cards of 2: 2+2=4. So two cards.\n\n    But wait, why didn't we use two cards of 3? 3+3=6, which is more than 4. But we don't need to use the same card twice? Actually, we can use two cards of 2. The minimal k is 2.\n\n    However, note: the problem doesn't specify that we have to use distinct cards. So we can use the same card multiple times.\n\n    But wait, our formula: ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2. Correct.\n\n    Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        t = -s\n        if t == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            k = (abs(t) + x - 1) // x\n            print(k)\n\n    However, wait: what if the sum is negative and large? \n\n    Example: n=1, x=10, card=[-10] -> total_sum=-10, t=10. Then k_min = ceil(10/10)=1. Correct.\n\n    Example: n=1, x=10, card=[10] -> same.\n\n    Example: n=2, x=10, cards=[10,10] -> total_sum=20, t=-20 -> ceil(20/10)=2. Correct.\n\n    Example: n=2, x=10, cards=[10,9] -> total_sum=19, t=-19 -> ceil(19/10)=2. Correct.\n\n    Example: n=2, x=10, cards=[10,1] -> total_sum=11, t=-11 -> ceil(11/10)=2. Correct.\n\n    Example: n=2, x=10, cards=[10,-1] -> total_sum=9, t=-9 -> ceil(9/10)=1. Correct.\n\n    All right.\n\n    But wait, wait: what if T is not an integer? But T is the negative of the sum of integers, so it is an integer.\n\n    So we are safe.\n\n    Final code:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        t = -s\n        if t == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            abs_t = abs(t)\n            # Ceiling division: (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n            k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n            print(k)\n\n    However, wait: there's an alternative way to compute ceiling division: \n        k = (abs_t - 1) // x + 1   if abs_t > 0\n\n    But note: if abs_t==0, then we already handled.\n\n    But let me test: \n        abs_t=2, x=2: (2-1)//2 + 1 = 1//2 + 1 = 0+1=1 -> correct.\n        abs_t=4, x=3: (4-1)//3 + 1 = 3//3 + 1 = 1+1=2 -> correct.\n\n    But wait, what if abs_t=0? Then we skip. \n\n    However, the above formula works for positive abs_t.\n\n    But the problem says that the found cards are integers, so t is integer.\n\n    Both methods are acceptable.\n\n    But the problem constraints are small, so either is fine.\n\n    We'll stick with the one we have.\n\n    Let me run the code with the provided examples again.\n\n    Example 1: \n        n=3, x=2, arr=[-1,1,2] -> s=2, t=-2, abs_t=2 -> k = (2+2-1)//2 = 3//2=1 -> output 1.\n\n    Example 2:\n        n=2, x=3, arr=[-2,-2] -> s=-4, t=4, abs_t=4 -> k=(4+3-1)//3=6//3=2 -> output 2.\n\n    It's correct.\n\n    Therefore, we output the code.\n\n    However, wait: I just saw that the problem says \"The second line contains n space-separated integers\", so we are reading n integers.\n\n    The code reads the first two tokens for n and x, then the next n tokens.\n\n    This is standard.\n\n    We are ready.\n\n    But wait, wait: the problem says \"You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from -x to x.\" and the found cards are n cards (each in [-x,x]). \n\n    The above reasoning and code are correct.\n\n    Submit.\n\n    However, wait: there is a possibility that we might be able to use negative and positive cards to cancel out without having to use the entire x? \n\n    Example: T=5, x=3. We can do 3+2=5, but 2 is allowed because 2<=3. Similarly, T=4, x=3: 3+1=4. \n\n    But our formula: ceil(4/3)=2. Correct.\n\n    The minimal k is determined by the fact that the maximum absolute value we can cover per card is x, so the minimal number of cards is at least ceil(|T|/x). And we can always achieve that by using as many x as needed (or -x for negative) and then adjusting with a smaller card if necessary. But note: we can use any integer in [-x,x], so we can adjust by any amount from -x to x.\n\n    Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n    Let me write the final code.\n\n    Note: We must read from stdin and write to stdout.\n\n    Code:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        t = -s\n        if t == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            abs_t = abs(t)\n            k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n            print(k)\n\n    But wait, wait: what if the minimal k is 0? We already handled t==0.\n\n    However, there is an alternative: what if T is 0? Then we print 0.\n\n    But note: the ceiling division for T=0 is (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x. For x>=1, (x-1)//x is 0 (if x>1) or (0)//1=0 if x=1. But we avoid that by the if branch.\n\n    So we are safe.\n\n    Let me test with T=0: \n        n=2, x=5, arr=[1,-1] -> s=0, t=0 -> prints 0.\n\n    Correct.\n\n    We are done.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his found cards equals zero. Each card he can find must have an integer value between -x and x (inclusive). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the sum of the found cards must be balanced out by the sum of the additional cards. If the current sum of the found cards is `S`, then the sum of the additional cards must be `-S` to make the total sum zero. \n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of cards required to achieve a sum `T` (where `T = -S`) is determined by the ceiling of the absolute value of `T` divided by `x`. This is because each card can contribute at most `x` (in absolute value) towards the target sum. For example, if `T` is 5 and `x` is 3, the minimal number of cards needed is 2 (since 3 + 2 = 5, and both 3 and 2 are within the allowed range).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves calculating the sum of the found cards, determining the target sum `T` as the negative of this sum, and then computing the minimal number of cards using ceiling division: `(abs(T) + x - 1) // x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    s = sum(arr)\n    t = -s\n    \n    if t == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        abs_t = abs(t)\n        k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of any card), followed by `n` integers representing the values on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. The target sum `T` is the negative of this sum, which needs to be achieved by the additional cards.\n3. **Special Case Handling**: If the target sum `T` is zero, no additional cards are needed, so the answer is 0.\n4. **Ceiling Division**: For non-zero `T`, the minimal number of cards is calculated using ceiling division. This ensures that even if the division isn't exact, we round up to the nearest integer to cover the entire magnitude of `T` with the given card constraints.\n5. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the minimal number of cards required to balance the sum to zero.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages arithmetic operations to determine the solution with optimal performance, handling all edge cases including zero sum and large magnitudes within constraints.",
