The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to use the condition: a_i + b_j is odd => (a_i % 2) != (b_j % 2)\n Therefore, we can separate the chests and keys by their parity.\n\n Let:\n   Chestes_even = number of chests with a_i even\n   Chestes_odd = number of chests with a_i odd\n\n   Keys_even = number of keys with b_j even\n   Keys_odd = number of keys with b_j odd\n\n Now, note that an even chest can only be opened by an odd key, and an odd chest can only be opened by an even key.\n\n So, we have two bipartite graphs (or two independent matching problems):\n\n 1. Even keys -> Odd chests: \n    But wait, actually: \n        - Even chest requires odd key.\n        - Odd chest requires even key.\n\n However, note the condition: \n        a_i (chest) + b_j (key) is odd.\n\n So if a_i is even, then b_j must be odd (because even + odd = odd).\n Similarly, if a_i is odd, then b_j must be even (because odd + even = odd).\n\n Therefore, we can form two groups:\n\n Group 1: (Even chests, Odd keys) for matching.\n Group 2: (Odd chests, Even keys) for matching.\n\n But note: one key or chest cannot be reused.\n\n However, we are allowed to use each key at most once and each chest at most once.\n\n The problem reduces to: we have two independent bipartite matchings (each on a bipartite graph with parts of different parities) and we wish to maximize the total number of chests opened.\n\n Since the two groups are independent (even keys can only open odd chests, and odd keys can only open even chests), we can solve them separately.\n\n However, note: there is no direct constraint between the two. So the total number of chests we can open is the sum of the maximum matching in the first bipartite graph and the maximum matching in the second.\n\n But wait: what is the maximum matching in a bipartite graph where we have two sets? Actually, in this case, the bipartite graph for group 1 has:\n\n   Left set: even keys (size = Keys_odd) [Wait! Correction: actually, for even chest we require odd keys. So the left set should be the odd keys? Or we can consider:]\n\n Alternatively, let's define:\n\n For group 1: Even chests and Odd keys.\n   We have two sets: \n        Set A (even chests): size = Chestes_even\n        Set B (odd keys): size = Keys_odd\n\n Then the maximum matching in this bipartite graph is min(Chestes_even, Keys_odd)? \n\n But wait, no: we can assign arbitrarily as long as the edges exist. In fact, the condition is just that the key and chest have the required parity. There is no restriction beyond that. So the entire bipartite graph is complete between the two sets.\n\n Therefore, the matching in group 1 is the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, but note: we cannot use the same key twice, so the maximum matching is limited by the smaller side.\n\n Similarly, for group 2: Odd chests and Even keys.\n   Set A (odd chests): size = Chestes_odd\n   Set B (even keys): size = Keys_even\n\n Then the matching is min(Chestes_odd, Keys_even)\n\n However, wait: is that really the case?\n\n Example: \n   n=5, m=4, chests = [9,14,6,2,11] -> even: [14,6,2] -> 3 even, odd: [9,11] -> 2 odd.\n   keys = [8,4,7,20] -> even: [8,4,20] -> 3 even, odd: [7] -> 1 odd.\n\n Then group 1: even chests (3) and odd keys (1) -> matching = min(3,1)=1.\n      group 2: odd chests (2) and even keys (3) -> matching = min(2,3)=2.\n      total = 1+2 = 3 -> matches the example.\n\n But wait, what if we have more keys than needed in one group? Then we can only use up to the number of chests of that parity.\n\n However, note: we cannot use the same key twice. So the matching is bounded by the number of available keys and the number of chests.\n\n But also note: the matching in each bipartite graph is just the minimum of the two set sizes? Actually, yes, because the graph is complete. \n\n However, there is a catch: the two bipartite graphs use disjoint sets of keys and chests. The keys used in group 1 (odd keys) are not available for",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their numbers is odd. This translates to matching chests and keys of opposite parity (one even and one odd).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Separate Chests and Keys by Parity**: \n   - Count the number of chests with even numbers (`Chestes_even`) and odd numbers (`Chestes_odd`).\n   - Similarly, count the number of keys with even numbers (`Keys_even`) and odd numbers (`Keys_odd`).\n\n2. **Determine Valid Matches**:\n   - An even-numbered chest can only be opened by an odd-numbered key.\n   - An odd-numbered chest can only be opened by an even-numbered key.\n\n3. **Calculate Maximum Matches**:\n   - For even chests and odd keys, the maximum number of matches is the minimum of `Chestes_even` and `Keys_odd`.\n   - For odd chests and even keys, the maximum number of matches is the minimum of `Chestes_odd` and `Keys_even`.\n\n4. **Sum the Matches**: The total number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the matches from both groups.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    a_list = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b_list = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    Chestes_even = 0\n    Chestes_odd = 0\n    for num in a_list:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            Chestes_even += 1\n        else:\n            Chestes_odd += 1\n            \n    Keys_even = 0\n    Keys_odd = 0\n    for num in b_list:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            Keys_even += 1\n        else:\n            Keys_odd += 1\n            \n    match1 = min(Chestes_even, Keys_odd)\n    match2 = min(Chestes_odd, Keys_even)\n    \n    total = match1 + match2\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective numbers.\n2. **Counting Parities**: The code counts how many chests and keys are even or odd by checking the modulo 2 result of each number.\n3. **Calculating Matches**: The solution calculates the maximum possible matches between even chests and odd keys, and between odd chests and even keys. Each match is constrained by the smaller count of the two groups involved.\n4. **Output Result**: The total number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the two maximum matches, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages parity checks to maximize the number of chests opened, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
