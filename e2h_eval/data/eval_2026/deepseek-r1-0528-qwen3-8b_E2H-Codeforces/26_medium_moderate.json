Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting non-degenerate triangles (x, y, z) with integer sides such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\nBut note: the condition is A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D.\n\nFor a triangle (x, y, z) to be non-degenerate, the triangle inequality must hold:\n   x + y > z\n   x + z > y\n   y + z > x\n\nHowever, given the constraints on x, y, z (x <= y <= z), the most restrictive condition is the first one (x+y>z). \nThe other two will automatically hold because:\n   Since x<=y<=z, then x+z >= x+y > z >= y? Actually, let's check:\n\nCondition 2: x+z > y. Since x>=0 and z>=y, then x+z >= y + z >= y+y = 2y >= y (because y>=0) but wait: actually, if we have x+z>y, and since x is positive and z>=y, then x+z >= x+y >= y+y? Not exactly.\n\nBut note: we know x <= y <= z. Then the inequalities become:\n   Condition 1: x + y > z.\n   Condition 2: x + z >= x + y (since z>=y) and we require x+z>y. But since z>=y, then x+z>=x+y. However, we don't know if x+y>y? Yes, because x>=A>=1 (given A>=1) so x+y>y holds. Similarly, condition 3: y+z>y+x? Actually, condition 3: y+z>x -> obviously true because y+z>=y+y>=x (since y>=x) and also because y+z>=C>=B>=x.\n\nSo the only condition we need to check is x+y>z.\n\nTherefore, we need to count the number of triples (x,y,z) such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D, and x+y>z.\n\nWe can break down the problem:\n\nTotal triples without the triangle condition: (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1)\n\nBut subtracting the ones that do not satisfy x+y>z is difficult because the condition is complex.\n\nAlternatively, we can iterate over x and y and count the valid z? But note that the ranges can be up to 500000, so iterating over all x and y (which would be about 500000*500000) is too slow.\n\nWe need a smarter way.\n\nLet me reframe: for fixed x and y, we require z < x+y. But z is in [C, D]. So the condition for z is: z < min(D, x+y) and z>=C. Also, note that we must have x+y>z, so z must be at most x+y-1.\n\nSo for fixed x and y, the number of z is:\n   If x+y-1 < C, then 0.\n   Else, the number of z is from max(C, ???) to min(D, x+y-1) but wait: actually, the lower bound for z is C (since C<=z<=D) and the upper bound is min(D, x+y-1). So the count is: max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1) provided that min(D, x+y-1) >= C.\n\nBut note: we have the constraint that z>=C. So the condition for having at least one z is: x+y-1 >= C (so that there exists a z from C to min(D, x+y-1)).\n\nSo we can write:\n\nFor each x from A to B, and for each y from B to C (with x<=y, but note x can be as low as A and y from B which is at least A, so x<=y is always true because A<=B and x<=B, y>=B, so x<=B<=y -> x<=y) then:\n\n   Let L = max(C, ...) but wait, no: for fixed x,y, the smallest z is C and the largest z we can take is min(D, x+y-1). So the count for this (x,y) is: \n        if x+y-1 < C: 0\n        else: max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1)\n\nBut note: we must also ensure that y is at least B (which it is) and at most C (which it is).\n\nHowever, iterating over x from A to B and y from B to C would be O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1)) which is about 500000 * 500000 in the worst case (when A=1, B=500000, C=500000) -> 25e10 iterations, which is too many.\n\nWe need to optimize.\n\nAlternative approach: fix z first? Or use mathematical formulas.\n\nNote: The condition is x+y>z, and we know x in [A,B], y in [B,C], z in [C,D]. \n\nWe can fix z (from C to D) and then count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z, with x in [A,B] and y in [B,C].\n\nBut note: the condition x+y>z is equivalent to y>z-x. For fixed z and x, we require y>z-x and y in [B, C].\n\nBut then we have to sum over x from A to B and for each x, y from max(B, floor(z-x)+1) to C (if any). Then we can do:\n\n   For z from C to D:\n        For x from A to B (but we can restrict x such that z-x < C? Actually, we require y>z-x and y<=C, so we require at least one y: so we need an interval for y from max(B, z-x+1) to C.\n\nBut then we are still iterating over z and x, which is (D-C+1) * (B-A+1) ~ 500000*500000 = 25e10 again.\n\nWe need a better method.\n\nAnother idea: Count the total number of triples (without the condition) and then subtract the ones that do not satisfy x+y>z.\n\nBut note: the condition for a triple (x,y,z) to be invalid is x+y<=z. And we know that x<=y<=z, so the triangle inequality fails only when x+y<=z.\n\nSo total = (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1)\nThen subtract the number of triples (x,y,z) such that x+y<=z.\n\nBut how to count the number of triples (x,y,z) with x in [A,B], y in [B,C], z in [C,D] and x+y<=z?\n\nWe can fix x and y and then count the z in [max(C, x+y), D] (if x+y>=C) but wait: the condition is x+y<=z, so z must be at least x+y and at most D, and also z>=C. So for fixed x,y, the number of z is max(0, D - max(x+y, C) + 1).\n\nBut again, iterating over x and y is too expensive.\n\nAlternatively, we can fix z and count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y<=z, with x in [A,B] and y in [B,C].\n\nThen the invalid triples = sum_{z=C}^{D} [number of pairs (x,y) with A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, and x+y<=z]\n\nNow, for fixed z, we need to count pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z, x in [A,B], y in [B,C].\n\nWe can precompute the pairs (x,y) that satisfy x+y<=z for each z? But z goes from C to D, and we cannot iterate over each z and then each x and y.\n\nBut note: we can change the order: for each x in [A,B], we can consider y in [B, min(C, z-x)] for each z? That doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, we can fix x and then y must be <= min(C, z-x). But then we have to sum for each z the pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z.\n\nAnother approach: Count the pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z for a fixed z.\n\nWe can fix x from A to B, and then y must be <= min(C, z-x). But note y has a lower bound B. So for each x, the y must be in [B, min(C, z-x)] and also we require y>=B and y<=min(C, z-x). The number of y for fixed x is: max(0, min(C, z-x) - B + 1) if min(C, z-x) >= B, otherwise 0.\n\nThen the total invalid triples = sum_{z=C}^{D} [sum_{x=A}^{B} max(0, min(C, z-x) - B + 1) ] but wait, that is not correct because for a fixed z and x, the condition is y<=min(C, z-x) and y>=B. However, we must ensure that min(C, z-x) >= B, otherwise there is no y.\n\nBut note: we can also write:\n\n   For fixed z, the pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z, x in [A,B], y in [B,C] are those with x <= z - B (because y>=B, so x+y>=x+B, so if x+B>z then no y) and y<=min(C, z-x).\n\nBut actually, the condition is y<=min(C, z-x) and y>=B. So the number of y for fixed x and z is: \n   Let y_low = B, y_high = min(C, z-x)\n   If y_high < B, then 0.\n   Else, y_high - B + 1.\n\nBut note: we must also have x+y<=z, and since y>=B, we must have x<=z-B (otherwise even the smallest y=B would give x+B>z). So we can break the x loop at x_min = A, x_max = min(B, z-B) (because if x > z-B, then even y=B gives x+y>z).\n\nSo for fixed z, the x runs from A to min(B, z-B) (if z-B>=A, otherwise no x). Then for each x in [A, min(B, z-B)], the y runs from B to min(C, z-x).\n\nThen the total invalid triples = sum_{z=C}^{D} [ sum_{x=A}^{min(B, z-B)} max(0, min(C, z-x) - B + 1) ]\n\nBut note: we must consider that the inner sum for x might be empty if min(B, z-B) < A.\n\nNow, how to compute this without iterating over each z and then each x?\n\nWe can try to change the order: iterate over x first, then over z.\n\nFor fixed x, what are the z for which the pair (x,y) is invalid? We require y in [B, C] and x+y<=z, and z in [C, D]. So for fixed x and y, z must be in [max(C, x+y), D]. But note we are counting the pairs (x,y) for a fixed z, so we want to count for each z the pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z.\n\nAlternatively, we can fix x and then consider the condition on y and z.\n\nBut note: the problem asks for the total number of triangles (with the condition) so:\n\n   Answer = total_triples - invalid_triples\n\nwhere total_triples = (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1)\n\nand invalid_triples = ?\n\nBut note: the above direct counting by iterating over x and z for the invalid condition is still too slow if we do nested loops.\n\nWe need to compute:\n\n   invalid_triples = sum_{z=C}^{D} F(z)\n\nwhere F(z) = sum_{x=A}^{min(B, z-B)} [ max(0, min(C, z-x) - B + 1) ]\n\nWe can rewrite F(z):\n\n   Let x run from A to min(B, z-B). Then for each x, the term is:\n        T(x, z) = max(0, min(C, z-x) - B + 1)\n\nBut note: we can split the term by comparing (z-x) and C:\n\n        If z-x >= C, then min(C, z-x)=C, so T(x,z) = C - B + 1, provided that C>=B (which is given, since B<=C).\n        Else, if z-x < C, then T(x,z) = (z-x) - B + 1, provided that (z-x)>=B (otherwise the min part would be negative and then we take max(0,...) so if (z-x)<B, then (z-x)-B+1 is negative, so then 0.\n\nBut note: the condition for having a valid y is that the lower bound B must be <= the upper bound (min(C, z-x)). So if min(C, z-x) < B, then the term is 0.\n\nActually, the term T(x,z) is:\n\n        if z-x < B: 0\n        else if z-x >= C: (C - B + 1)\n        else: (z-x - B + 1)\n\nBut note: the condition for the term to be nonzero is that z-x >= B, i.e., x <= z-B.\n\nAnd then the term depends on whether z-x is in [B, C-1] or >=C.\n\nBut we can break the x range for fixed z:\n\n   Let x_low = A\n   Let x_high = min(B, z-B)   [because if x>z-B then no y (even the smallest y=B gives x+y>z)]\n\nThen for x from x_low to x_high:\n\n   We have three cases for the value of T(x,z):\n\n   Case 1: z-x < B -> then T(x,z)=0. This happens when x > z-B (but we have x<=z-B, so this case does not occur in our x range [A, min(B, z-B)]).\n\n   Actually, we set x_high = min(B, z-B) so x<=z-B, so z-x>=B. Therefore, we don't have the case z-x < B.\n\n   Then, we have two cases:\n\n        Case 2: B <= z-x < C   => T(x,z) = (z-x) - B + 1\n        Case 3: z-x >= C        => T(x,z) = C - B + 1\n\nBut note: the condition for Case 2 is: z-x < C  <=> x > z-C (but note: x is integer, so x>= floor(z-C)+1? Actually, x > z-C is the same as x >= ceil(z-C+1)? Let me rephrase:\n\n        z-x < C   <=> x > z-C\n\nBut since x is integer, we can write: x >= floor(z-C) + 1? Actually, x must be at least floor(z-C)+1? Let me see:\n\n        We require x > z-C. Since x is integer, x >= floor(z-C) + 1.\n\nBut note: if z-C is integer, then x>=z-C+1.\n\nAlternatively, we can define:\n\n   Let L1 = max(A, floor(z-C)+1)   [then for x from L1 to min(B, z-B), the term is (z-x) - B + 1]?\n   But wait, we have two conditions: \n        x <= z-B (from the range) and x >= A, and for the term being in Case 2 we require x > z-C.\n\nActually, the condition for Case 2 is: x > z-C, i.e., x >= floor(z-C)+1.\n\nBut note: if z-C is not an integer, then floor(z-C) is the greatest integer less than z-C, so x>=floor(z-C)+1 is the same as x>z-C.\n\nSo for fixed z, the x runs from A to min(B, z-B). Then we split the x range at x0 = floor(z-C)+1 (if it falls in [A, min(B, z-B)]).\n\nThen:\n\n   Part1: x from A to min(B, z-B) but we split at x0 = floor(z-C)+1.\n\n   Actually, the condition for Case 2 is x >= x0 and x <= min(B, z-B). But note: the condition for Case 2 is x >= x0, and for Case 3 is x <= z-C (but wait, Case 3 is defined by z-x>=C, which is x<=z-C). \n\nWait, I think I mixed up. Let me redefine:\n\n   Condition for Case 3: z-x >= C  <=> x <= z-C.\n\nBut note: we already have x<=z-B (from the range). And z-C <= z-B (because C>=B). So the entire x range is from A to min(B, z-B). Now, the condition for Case 3 is x <= z-C (which is a stricter condition on the upper bound). \n\nActually, we have:\n\n   T(x,z) = \n        if x <= z-C: then (z-x) - B + 1   [because then z-x >= C, so we use the first branch? Wait no, wait: \n\nWait, I had:\n\n   if z-x >= C: then T(x,z)=C-B+1\n   else (z-x < C): then T(x,z)= (z-x) - B + 1\n\nBut note: the condition for the first branch is z-x>=C, i.e., x<=z-C.\n\nBut wait, we set x_high = min(B, z-B). And we know z-B >= z-C (because B<=C). So if x<=z-C, then we are in Case 3. Otherwise, if x is between (z-C, z-B] (i.e., z-C < x <= z-B) then we are in Case 2.\n\nSo:\n\n   Let x_low1 = A\n   Let x_high1 = min(B, z-B)   [this is the entire x range]\n\n   Then we split the x range at x0 = floor(z-C) (but note: we want x<=z-C, so the condition is x<=floor(z-C) if we are in integers? Actually, in integers, x<=z-C is the same as x <= z-C (exact).\n\nBut wait: z and x are integers, so z-x>=C  <=> x<=z-C.\n\nSimilarly, the condition for Case 2 is z-x < C, i.e., x > z-C (in integers, x>=z-C+1).\n\nSo:\n\n   Case 3: x from A to min(B, z-C)   [if z-C >= A, otherwise no x in Case 3]\n        Then T(x,z) = C - B + 1\n\n   Case 2: x from max(A, z-C+1) to min(B, z-B)\n        Then T(x,z) = (z-x) - B + 1\n\nBut note: if z-C+1 is greater than min(B, z-B), then Case 2 is empty.\n\nSo F(z) = [for Case 3: if min(B, z-C) >= A, then (min(B, z-C) - A + 1) * (C-B+1) else 0] \n          + [for Case 2: if the interval [max(A, z-C+1), min(B, z-B)] is non-empty, then we need to compute the sum of (z-x - B + 1) for x in that interval]\n\nNow, the second part (Case 2) is a linear function in x. We can compute the sum quickly.\n\nLet L = max(A, z-C+1)\nLet R = min(B, z-B)\n\nThen the sum for Case 2 is: sum_{x=L}^{R} (z - x - B + 1) = (number of terms) * (z - B + 1) - sum_{x=L}^{R} x\n\nNumber of terms = R - L + 1\n\nSum_{x=L}^{R} x = (L+R)*(R-L+1)//2\n\nSo:\n\n   Case2_sum = (R - L + 1) * (z - B + 1) - (L+R)*(R-L+1)//2\n\nThen F(z) = (if z-C >= A: (min(B, z-C) - A + 1) * (C-B+1) else 0) + (if R>=L then Case2_sum else 0)\n\nBut note: the condition for Case 3 is x from A to min(B, z-C). However, if z-C < A, then min(B, z-C) < A, so the Case 3 part is 0.\n\nSimilarly, if z-C+1 > min(B, z-B) then Case 2 is 0.\n\nNow, we can iterate z from C to D and compute F(z) for each z. The total iteration is (D-C+1) which is up to 500000, and each F(z) is computed in constant time.\n\nBut note: the constraints say that A, B, C, D can be up to 500000, so D-C+1 can be 500000, and each F(z) is O(1). Then the entire loop is O(D-C) which is acceptable.\n\nThen invalid_triples = sum_{z=C}^{D} F(z)\n\nThen the answer = total_triples - invalid_triples\n\nBut wait: is that correct? \n\nWe defined invalid_triples as the count of triples (x,y,z) with x+y<=z. Then the valid triples are the ones that satisfy x+y>z.\n\nBut note: our condition for the triangle is x+y>z, and we are subtracting the ones that are not (x+y<=z). So yes.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious: the condition for the triangle is non-degenerate and we have the side constraints. Our counting of invalid_triples is for the entire range of x,y,z.\n\nBut note: we are counting all triples (x,y,z) in the given ranges that do not form a triangle. Then subtract from the total.\n\nBut wait: is the total_triples defined correctly?\n\ntotal_triples = (number of x) * (number of y) * (number of z) = (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1)\n\nBut note: the problem states that x in [A,B], y in [B,C], z in [C,D]. So yes.\n\nBut wait: the example input: \"1 2 3 4\"\n\nThen A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\ntotal_triples = (2-1+1)=2 * (3-2+1)=2 * (4-3+1)=2 -> total=8.\n\nBut the example output is 4. So the invalid_triples should be 4.\n\nLet's compute invalid_triples for the example:\n\nWe have to consider z from 3 to 4.\n\nFor z=3:\n   Case 3: x from A=1 to min(B=2, z-C=0) -> min(2,0)=0, so no x in Case 3.\n   Case 2: L = max(1, 3-3+1)=max(1,1)=1, R = min(2, 3-2)=min(2,1)=1.\n        Then Case2_sum = (1-1+1) * (3-2+1) - (1+1)* (1) //2 = 1 * 2 - (2*1//2) = 2 - 1 = 1.\n\n   So F(3)=1.\n\nFor z=4:\n   Case 3: x from 1 to min(2, 4-3)=min(2,1)=1.\n        Then Case3: (1-1+1)*(3-2+1)=1*2=2.\n   Case 2: L = max(1, 4-3+1)=max(1,2)=2, R = min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2.\n        Then Case2: (2-2+1)*(4-2+1) - (2+2)*(1)//2 = 1*3 - (4//2)=3-2=1.\n\n   So F(4)=2+1=3.\n\nThen invalid_triples = F(3)+F(4)=1+3=4.\n\nThen answer = 8-4=4, which matches the example.\n\nBut wait, the example says there are 4 triangles. So 8-4=4 is correct.\n\nHowever, let's check the example input \"1 2 2 5\": \n   A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\ntotal_triples = (2-1+1)=2 * (2-2+1)=1 * (5-2+1)=4 -> total=8.\n\nNow, we compute invalid_triples:\n\nz from 2 to 5.\n\nBut note: C=2, so z starts at 2.\n\nFor z=2:\n   Case 3: x from 1 to min(2, 2-2)=min(2,0)=0 -> no x in Case 3.\n   Case 2: L = max(1,2-2+1)=max(1,1)=1, R = min(2,2-2)=min(2,0)=0 -> no x in Case 2.\n   F(2)=0.\n\nFor z=3:\n   Case 3: x from 1 to min(2,3-2)=min(2,1)=1.\n        Then Case3: (1-1+1)*(2-2+1)=1*1=1.\n   Case 2: L = max(1,3-2+1)=max(1,2)=2, R = min(2,3-2)=min(2,1)=1 -> no x in Case 2.\n   F(3)=1.\n\nFor z=4:\n   Case 3: x from 1 to min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2.\n        Then Case3: (2-1+1)*(2-2+1)=2*1=2.\n   Case 2: L = max(1,4-2+1)=max(1,3)=3, R = min(2,4-2)=2 -> no x in Case 2.\n   F(4)=2.\n\nFor z=5:\n   Case 3: x from 1 to min(2,5-2)=min(2,3)=2.\n        Then Case3: (2-1+1)*(2-2+1)=2*1=2.\n   Case 2: L = max(1,5-2+1)=max(1,4)=4, R = min(2,5-2)=2 -> no x in Case 2.\n   F(5)=2.\n\nTotal invalid_triples = 0+1+2+2=5.\n\nThen answer = 8-5=3, which matches the example.\n\nAnd the third example: \"500000 500000 500000 500000\"\n\ntotal_triples = (1) * (1) * (1)=1.\n\ninvalid_triples: z from 500000 to 500000.\n\nCase 3: x from 500000 to min(500000, 500000-500000)=min(500000,0)=0 -> no x in Case 3.\nCase 2: L = max(500000, 500000-500000+1)=max(500000,1)=500000, R=min(500000,500000-500000)=min(500000,0)=0 -> no x in Case 2.\n\nSo F(500000)=0.\n\nThen answer=1-0=1.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nNow, we code accordingly.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Read A, B, C, D.\n\n2. total = (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1)\n\n3. invalid = 0\n   for z from C to D:\n        # Case 3: x from A to min(B, z-C) [if z-C>=A, otherwise empty]\n        x_high3 = min(B, z - C)   # Note: if z-C < A, then we use A to ... but wait, if z-C < A, then the range [A, min(B, z-C)] is empty because min(B, z-C) < A.\n        count3 = 0\n        if x_high3 >= A:\n            count3 = x_high3 - A + 1\n        else:\n            count3 = 0\n\n        term3 = count3 * (C - B + 1)   # because each x in Case3 gives (C-B+1) y's\n\n        # Case 2: x from max(A, z-C+1) to min(B, z-B) [note: we require x<=z-B for the entire range, and also for Case2 we require x>=z-C+1]\n        L2 = max(A, z - C + 1)\n        R2 = min(B, z - B)   # note: the condition for the entire range is x<=z-B (from the definition of the entire x range for invalid triples) and also x<=B.\n\n        if L2 <= R2:\n            # Number of terms = R2 - L2 + 1\n            n_terms = R2 - L2 + 1\n            # Sum of x from L2 to R2: (L2+R2)*n_terms//2\n            sum_x = (L2 + R2) * n_terms // 2\n            # The term for each x is (z - x - B + 1)\n            # So total for Case2 = n_terms*(z-B+1) - sum_x\n            term2 = n_terms * (z - B + 1) - sum_x\n        else:\n            term2 = 0\n\n        invalid += term3 + term2\n\n4. answer = total - invalid\n\nBut wait, in Case3 we used (C-B+1) for each x. Why?\n\nBecause for fixed x (in Case3) and any y in [B, C], the condition x+y<=z holds (since y<=C and x<=z-C, so x+y<=z-C+C=z). So there are (C-B+1) y's for each x.\n\nIn Case2, for fixed x, the y's must be in [B, min(C, z-x)]. But note: in Case2, we have x>=z-C+1, so z-x <= C-1, so min(C, z-x)=z-x. And the condition for y is y<=z-x and y>=B. So the number of y's is (z-x - B + 1) (provided that z-x>=B, which is true because x<=z-B, so z-x>=B).\n\nSo yes, the term for Case2 is (z-x - B + 1) for each x.\n\nBut note: in Case3, we are counting all y's (from B to C) for each x, and in Case2 we are counting only the y's from B to z-x.\n\nHowever, note that in Case3, we are not double counting because the conditions are disjoint: either x<=z-C or x>z-C.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch: In Case3, we require x<=z-C, and in Case2 we require x>z-C (so they are disjoint). So the entire set of x in [A, min(B, z-B)] is partitioned into these two.\n\nBut note: the entire set of x is from A to min(B, z-B). And we split at x0 = z-C+1. \n\nHowever, note: the condition for Case3 is x<=z-C, and Case2 is x>=z-C+1. So indeed disjoint and cover all x in the entire range.\n\nBut wait: what if x is not in [A, min(B, z-B)]? Then we don't consider it. We have defined the entire range for x as [A, min(B, z-B)].\n\nBut note: we set x_high = min(B, z-B) for the entire range. Then we split that range at x0 = z-C+1.\n\nBut note: if z-B < A, then the entire range is empty (so no x) and both terms are 0.\n\nBut wait, in our code we set:\n   For Case3: x_high3 = min(B, z-C) and then if x_high3>=A, then we count from A to x_high3.\n\nBut note: the entire x range for invalid triples is from A to min(B, z-B). However, in Case3 we are using min(B, z-C) and in Case2 we are using min(B, z-B). This is correct because:\n\n   Case3: the condition is x<=z-C, but we also have the constraint that x<=B and x<=z-B (from the entire range) but wait: no, the entire range is defined by x<=min(B, z-B). However, note that z-C might be larger than z-B? Actually, since B<=C, then z-C <= z-B. So min(B, z-C) <= min(B, z-B). \n\nBut wait, no: the entire x range is [A, min(B, z-B)]. Then in Case3, we are only considering the x in that entire range that are <= z-C. But note: if z-C is less than min(B, z-B), then we take the minimum of the entire range and z-C? Actually, no: the entire range is [A, min(B, z-B)] and we are restricting further to x<=z-C. So the Case3 x range is [A, min(min(B, z-B), z-C)] = [A, min(B, z-C)].\n\nSimilarly, Case2: the entire range is [A, min(B, z-B)] and we are taking the part from max(A, z-C+1) to min(B, z-B).\n\nBut wait, in our code we did:\n\n   For Case3: x_high3 = min(B, z-C)   [then we check if x_high3>=A]\n\n   Then for Case2: we set L2 = max(A, z-C+1) and R2 = min(B, z-B)\n\nBut note: the entire x range is [A, min(B, z-B)]. In Case3, we are only taking the x from A to min(B, z-C) (which is a sub-interval of [A, min(B, z-B)] because z-C<=z-B). And then Case2 takes the rest of the entire x range (from max(A, z-C+1) to min(B, z-B)).\n\nBut wait, what if there is an x in [A, min(B, z-B)] that is greater than z-C but less than z-C+1? That's not possible because x is integer and the condition for Case3 is x<=z-C, and Case2 is x>=z-C+1. They are adjacent.\n\nHowever, note: our entire x range is [A, min(B, z-B)] and we split at z-C+1, so we have covered the entire set.\n\nBut wait: the entire x range is defined by min(B, z-B). In Case3 we use min(B, z-C) and in Case2 we use min(B, z-B). But note: the entire range for x is [A, min(B, z-B)] and we are splitting that range at z-C+1. However, if z-C+1 is greater than min(B, z-B), then Case2 is empty. And if z-C is less than A, then Case3 is empty.\n\nBut note: the entire range [A, min(B, z-B)] might have x values that are above z-B? No, because we defined the entire range as min(B, z-B).\n\nWait, let me clarify: the entire x range is [A, min(B, z-B)]. Then:\n\n   Case3: x from A to min(B, z-C) [but note: if min(B, z-C) is greater than min(B, z-B), then we are including more? Actually, no: because z-C <= z-B (since C>=B), so min(B, z-C) <= min(B, z-B). \n\nBut wait, no: if z-C <= B, then min(B, z-C)=z-C, and if z-B <= B, then min(B, z-B)=z-B.",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Given the constraints \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\), the most restrictive condition is \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires counting all possible triples \\((x, y, z)\\) within the given ranges that satisfy the triangle inequality \\(x + y > z\\). The straightforward approach of iterating over all possible values of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) would be computationally infeasible for large ranges (up to \\(5 \\times 10^5\\)).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: Instead of checking each triple individually, we can compute the total number of valid triples by subtracting the invalid ones from the total possible triples. The total triples are calculated as \\((B - A + 1) \\times (C - B + 1) \\times (D - C + 1)\\). \n\n3. **Invalid Triples Calculation**: For each \\(z\\) in the range \\([C, D]\\), count the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x + y \\leq z\\). This is done by:\n   - **Case 3**: \\(x \\leq z - C\\) and \\(y \\leq C\\). Here, all \\(y\\) values from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\) are valid for each \\(x\\).\n   - **Case 2**: \\(x > z - C\\) and \\(x \\leq z - B\\).
