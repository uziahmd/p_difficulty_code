Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n vouchers and a total duration x.\n Each voucher: (l, r, cost) with duration = (r - l + 1)\n\n Conditions:\n 1. We need exactly two distinct vouchers i and j such that the sum of their durations is exactly x.\n 2. They must not intersect: either ri < lj or rj < li.\n\n Approach:\n\n Since x can be up to 200,000, and the days (l, r) are also up to 200,000, we need an efficient way.\n\n Steps:\n\n Let's denote:\n   d_i = r_i - l_i + 1   (duration)\n\n We are looking for two vouchers i and j such that:\n   d_i + d_j = x\n   and the intervals [l_i, r_i] and [l_j, r_j] do not overlap.\n\n Note: The non-overlap condition is equivalent to one of the two:\n        Condition 1: r_i < l_j\n        Condition 2: r_j < l_i\n\n How to approach?\n\n Idea 1: Group vouchers by their duration.\n   For each duration d (from 1 to maybe 200000), we can have a list of vouchers (or better, store in a structure that allows efficient query).\n\n But note: x can be as large as 200000, so we are looking for two durations d1 and d2 such that d1+d2=x.\n\n Then for each pair (d1, d2) with d1+d2=x, we want to find two vouchers with durations d1 and d2 that do not overlap.\n\n However, the number of distinct durations might be up to 200000, and we cannot iterate over every pair.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute for each duration d, the minimal cost and the best intervals (but we also need to check non-overlapping condition).\n\n But note: the non-overlapping condition depends on the actual intervals, not just the duration.\n\n Another idea: Instead of grouping by duration, we can consider the entire set of vouchers and use two pointers or dynamic programming? \n However, the condition on non-overlap and the requirement on duration sum being exactly x complicates things.\n\n Alternative plan:\n\n Step 1: Precompute an array `min_cost_for_duration` but this alone is not enough because we have to check non-overlap.\n\n Step 2: We can try to fix one voucher and then look for another voucher that has duration = x - d_i, and that does not overlap.\n\n But n can be up to 200000, and if we do this for each voucher, it could be O(n^2). We need a more efficient way.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n We are going to group the vouchers by duration. But also, we need to know the intervals for each duration.\n\n However, the non-overlap condition is defined by the intervals. So for a fixed duration d, we might have many intervals.\n\n What if we preprocess for each duration d, we store all the intervals (l, r) that have duration d, and then for each such interval, we can quickly find if there exists an interval in the complementary duration (x-d) that does not overlap.\n\n But how to quickly check for non-overlap?\n\n Condition: \n   Either [l_i, r_i] and [l_j, r_j] satisfy r_i < l_j OR r_j < l_i.\n\n Actually, the non-overlap condition is symmetric. \n\n However, note: if we have two intervals A and B, then either A ends before B starts OR B ends before A starts.\n\n So for a fixed voucher i (with duration d_i), we require a voucher j (with duration d_j = x - d_i) such that either:\n   r_i < l_j   OR   r_j < l_i.\n\n But note: the first condition (r_i < l_j) implies that voucher i ends before voucher j starts. \n The second condition (r_j < l_i) implies that voucher j ends before voucher i starts.\n\n So we can split the problem:\n\n   For a voucher i, we want to find a voucher j (with duration d_j = x - d_i) such that:\n        Option 1: j starts after r_i (so l_j > r_i)\n        Option 2: j ends before l_i (so r_j < l_i)\n\n However, we cannot iterate over all j for each i.\n\n We can precompute two structures:\n\n   Structure 1: For each duration d, store the list of intervals (l, r) and perhaps sort them by l or by r.\n\n   Then for each duration d, we can create:\n        - A sorted list of the starting days (l) for all vouchers of duration d.\n        - A sorted list of the ending days (r) for all vouchers of duration d.\n\n   But then, for a given voucher i (with duration d_i) and target duration d_t = x - d_i, we want to check:\n\n        Option 1: Find a voucher j (in d_t) with l_j > r_i. We can do this by having the list of l_j for duration d_t sorted, then do a binary search for the smallest l_j that is > r_i and take the one with minimal cost.\n\n        Option 2: Find a voucher j (in d_t) with r_j < l_i. Similarly, we can have the list of r_j for duration d_t sorted, then find the largest r_j that is < l_i and take the minimal cost for that.\n\n   However, note: we are storing the same set of vouchers for a duration. But we need to store the minimal cost for a given interval property (like minimal cost for a voucher that has l_j > r_i). \n\n   Alternatively, we can store for each duration d:\n        - Two arrays: \n            starts[d] = sorted list of starting days (l) for all vouchers of duration d.\n            ends[d] = sorted list of ending days (r) for all vouchers of duration d.\n\n        And also, we want to know the minimal cost for a voucher in d that satisfies certain conditions.\n\n   But note: we are given the cost for each voucher. So we cannot just store the minimal cost for the entire duration d, because the condition (like l_j > r_i) depends on the specific voucher.\n\n   We can precompute for each duration d:\n\n        Let's have a list of (l, r, cost) for that duration. Then, we can:\n\n        For Option 1: We need the minimal cost among all vouchers in d_t that have l >= some value (specifically l_j > r_i). \n\n        Similarly for Option 2: minimal cost among all vouchers in d_t that have r <= some value (specifically r_j < l_i).\n\n   How to do that without scanning all vouchers for each query?\n\n   We can precompute for each duration d:\n\n        Sort the list of (l, r, cost) by l (for Option 1) and by r (for Option 2).\n\n        Then, for the same duration d, we want to answer queries of the form:\n\n            Query1: Given a threshold T (which is r_i from voucher i), find the minimal cost among all vouchers in d with l > T.\n\n            Query2: Given a threshold T (which is l_i from voucher i), find the minimal cost among all vouchers in d with r < T.\n\n   We can precompute for each duration d:\n\n        For Query1: \n            Sort by l, then for each distinct l, we can keep the minimal cost for any voucher with l >= current_l? Actually, we can do:\n\n            Sort the list for duration d by l. Then, we can create an array of l's and an array of minimal costs from the last element backwards.\n\n            Specifically, for the sorted list (by l) of (l, r, cost), we can do:\n\n                sorted_list_by_l = sorted([(l, r, cost) for ...], key=lambda x: x[0])\n                Then, we can create an array min_cost_from_right where:\n                    min_cost_from_right[i] = minimum cost from index i to the end.\n\n            Then, for a given T, we can do:\n\n                Find the first index idx such that l[idx] > T (using bisect_right or bisect_left). Then if idx exists, min_cost_from_right[idx] is the minimal cost for a voucher with l > T.\n\n        Similarly, for Query2:\n\n            Sort the list by r.\n\n            Then, we can create an array min_cost_from_left (or min_cost_from_right) for increasing r? Actually, we want for a given T, the minimal cost for a voucher with r < T.\n\n            So we sort by r, then traverse from left to right and keep a running minimum.\n\n            Let sorted_list_by_r = sorted([(l, r, cost) for ...], key=lambda x: x[0]) wait no, by r.\n\n            Then, for the same list, we can do:\n\n                min_cost_so_far = a big number\n                Then, for each element in increasing order of r, update min_cost_so_far = min(min_cost_so_far, cost) and store in an array that we can use to query by r?\n\n            Actually, we can do:\n\n                Create an array for the minimal cost for any voucher in d with r <= current_r (but we want for r < T, so we can use the same sorted by r and then take the minimal cost for all elements up to the one with r < T).\n\n            Alternatively, we can precompute:\n\n                sorted_list_by_r = sorted(..., key=lambda x: x[1])\n                Then, we can do:\n\n                    prefix_min[i] = min(cost for the first i+1 elements)   [if we consider the first i+1 elements]\n\n            Then, for a given T, we find the largest index j such that r[j] < T, then prefix_min[j] is the minimal cost for a voucher with r < T.\n\n   But note: we are going to do this for each duration d that appears, and then for each voucher i (which is in some duration d_i) we will query the complementary duration d_t = x - d_i.\n\n   However, we must consider that the same duration d might be used in multiple pairs (like if d_i = d_j and d_i + d_j = x, then d_i = d_j = x/2). \n\n   Steps:\n\n     1. Read input and group vouchers by duration.\n\n        We'll create a dictionary: \n            duration_dict = {}\n            for each voucher (l, r, cost):\n                d = r - l + 1\n                if d not in duration_dict:\n                    duration_dict[d] = []\n                append (l, r, cost) to duration_dict[d]\n\n     2. Preprocess each duration d in duration_dict:\n\n            For each d, we have a list L of (l, r, cost).\n\n            Then, we want to build two structures:\n\n                Structure for Option1 (query by l): \n                    Sort L by l (the start day). Then, we create an array `min_cost_from_right` for the sorted list:\n\n                    sorted_by_l = sorted(L, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                    Then, we can create an array M1 of the same length as sorted_by_l, where:\n                        M1[i] = minimum cost from index i to the end in sorted_by_l.\n\n                    We can compute M1 from right to left.\n\n                Structure for Option2 (query by r):\n                    Sort L by r (the end day). Then, we create an array `prefix_min` for the sorted list:\n\n                    sorted_by_r = sorted(L, key=lambda x: x[1])\n                    Then, we can create an array M2 of the same length as sorted_by_r, where:\n                        M2[i] = minimum cost for the first i+1 elements (from 0 to i) in sorted_by_r.\n\n            Additionally, we want to be able to query by threshold. For Option1, we are given a threshold T (which is r_i from voucher i) and we want to find the minimal cost for a voucher in d_t (which is the complementary duration) with l > T.\n\n            But note: the query for Option1 is done on the complementary duration d_t, so we have built the structure for d_t.\n\n            Similarly, for Option2, we query the structure for d_t (complementary) with r < l_i.\n\n     3. Iterate over each voucher i (each voucher is in some duration d_i). Then:\n\n            d_t = x - d_i   (must be positive and at least 1)\n\n            If d_t is not in duration_dict, skip.\n\n            Then, we have two options:\n\n                Option1: Check if there exists a voucher j in d_t such that l_j > r_i. Then the candidate cost is the minimal cost found from the structure for d_t (Option1) for l > r_i.\n\n                Option2: Check if there exists a voucher j in d_t such that r_j < l_i. Then the candidate cost is the minimal cost found from the structure for d_t (Option2) for r < l_i.\n\n            Then, the total cost for this pair (i and j) is cost_i + candidate_cost (if candidate_cost is found).\n\n            We want the minimal total cost over all i and the two options.\n\n     4. However, note: the same voucher j might be considered multiple times? But we are iterating over i and then querying the complementary duration. This is okay because the two vouchers must be distinct. But note: if d_i == d_t and the same voucher is used twice? We must ensure that we don't use the same voucher twice.\n\n        But our grouping by duration d_t includes all vouchers of that duration, and we are not filtering by excluding the current voucher i. However, if d_i == d_t, then we are including the current voucher i in the list for d_t? \n\n        We must avoid using the same voucher twice. So we have to be careful.\n\n        How to handle?\n\n        We can do two things:\n\n          a) When building the structures for a duration d, we do not include the current voucher i when querying for d_t (if d_i == d_t). But then we have to remove the current voucher i from the structure for d_t. \n\n          b) Alternatively, we can design the structures to allow excluding a particular voucher. However, that would complicate the preprocessing.\n\n        But note: the problem says two distinct vouchers. So we must not choose the same voucher twice.\n\n        Since the two vouchers are chosen from two different groups (unless d_i = d_t) then:\n\n          - If d_i != d_t, then the two vouchers are from different groups and we don't have to worry.\n\n          - If d_i == d_t, then we are querying the same duration. In this case, we must not pick the same voucher i twice.\n\n        How to handle the case d_i == d_t?\n\n          We can precompute for each duration d:\n\n            We have the entire list for d, and we build two structures (one for l and one for r). Then, when processing a voucher i with duration d (and d_t = d) we need to consider the entire set except voucher i.\n\n        This becomes messy.\n\n        Alternatively, we can separate the two parts: we are going to consider pairs (i, j) with i and j distinct. We can do:\n\n          For each duration d, we have a list of vouchers. Then, for a fixed d and complementary d_t (which may be the same or different), we want to combine the two lists.\n\n        But note: the problem is symmetric in i and j, so we might double count. However, we are iterating over each voucher i and then querying the complementary set. This is acceptable because we are only concerned with the minimal cost.\n\n        However, if d_i == d_t, then when we process voucher i, we are going to query the same duration d_i (which includes voucher i). Then we must exclude voucher i from the set for d_t.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          For each duration d, we store two structures (for Option1 and Option2) that are built from the entire set.\n\n          Then, for a voucher i (with duration d_i) and d_t = x - d_i, we:\n\n            If d_i != d_t:\n                candidate1 = query_structure(d_t, Option1, T = r_i)   [if exists]\n                candidate2 = query_structure(d_t, Option2, T = l_i)   [if exists]\n\n            If d_i == d_t:\n                Then we need to exclude voucher i from the set for d_t.\n\n                We can do: \n                    candidate1 = query_structure_without_voucher(d_t, Option1, T = r_i, exclude_voucher_id = i)\n                    candidate2 = query_structure_without_voucher(d_t, Option2, T = l_i, exclude_voucher_id = i)\n\n          But how to build a structure that supports exclusion? \n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute for each duration d:\n\n            We build two structures (for Option1 and Option2) for the entire set.\n\n            Then, we also build two more structures that are similar but for each voucher we can remove one? \n\n        However, note: we are iterating over each voucher i and then we want to exclude it from the complementary duration set only when d_i == d_t. \n\n        This would require that for each duration d, we have:\n\n            Structure1 (for Option1): a sorted list by l and a suffix-min array.\n\n            Structure2 (for Option2): a sorted list by r and a prefix-min array.\n\n            Additionally, we want to be able to remove a particular voucher (by its l, r, or cost?) but note: the query is by l and r, and the cost is stored. \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            For the same duration d, we store the entire list. Then, when we are processing a voucher i (with duration d_i) and d_t = d_i (so d_t = d_i) then we can temporarily remove voucher i from the structure for d_t. \n\n        But we cannot modify the structure for d_t because we are using it for multiple queries.\n\n        Another idea: Precompute for each duration d, the entire structure (for Option1 and Option2) and then also store the entire list of vouchers (without duplicates). Then, when d_i == d_t, we can:\n\n            candidate1 = the minimal cost from the entire set for Option1 (l > r_i) but then subtract the effect of voucher i? Actually, we cannot simply subtract because the minimal cost might come from voucher i.\n\n        We can do: \n\n            We store two global structures for each duration d: one for the entire set, and then we also store the minimal cost and the voucher that achieved that minimal cost for Option1 and Option2. Then, if the minimal cost voucher in the entire set for Option1 is voucher i, then we need to look for the next minimal cost that is not voucher i.\n\n        But that requires storing the entire list and then doing removals, which is expensive.\n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute for each duration d:\n\n            We build two structures: one for Option1 (entire set) and one for Option2 (entire set). \n\n            Then, we also build two more structures: one for Option1 that excludes each voucher? That is too heavy.\n\n        Another idea: Instead of processing each voucher i individually, we can consider all pairs (d1, d2) such that d1+d2=x. Then, for each pair (d1, d2) we combine the two sets (set1 for duration d1, set2 for duration d2) and then check for non-overlap. \n\n        Then, we can do:\n\n            For a fixed pair (d1, d2) (with d1<=d2 to avoid duplication? Actually, we don't know which one is first, but note: the non-overlap condition is symmetric) we can:\n\n            For each voucher in d1, we want to find a voucher in d2 that does not overlap.\n\n            Then, we can use two pointers or something.\n\n        However, the total number of distinct durations might be large (up to 200000) and we cannot iterate over each distinct duration pair.\n\n        But note: x is fixed, so d1 must be such that d2 = x - d1 is a valid duration. So the distinct d1 we consider are those for which d1 is in the keys of duration_dict and d2 = x - d1 is also in the keys.\n\n        Then, the total distinct pairs is at most the number of divisors of x (but actually, we are not restricted by divisors, but by the available durations). The distinct durations present in the input are at most 200000, but the distinct d1 that are in the dictionary and for which x-d1 is also in the dictionary is at most the size of the dictionary (which is <= n, but n<=200000). \n\n        However, if we iterate over each distinct duration d1 (that is in the dictionary and for which x-d1 is also in the dictionary) and then for each voucher in d1, we query the set for d2, then the total work is the sum_{d1} (size(d1)) * log(size(d2)). \n\n        But the worst-case size(d1) and size(d2) can be large. The total n is 200000, so the worst-case is if one duration has 200000 vouchers and the other has 0? Actually, the entire set is 200000, so the worst-case for a fixed d1 is that d1 has 200000/2 if we split evenly? Actually, we are grouping by duration, so the same duration can appear many times.\n\n        But note: the total number of vouchers is 200000, so the sum of the sizes of all groups is 200000.\n\n        However, the distinct durations we consider: the number of distinct d1 such that d1 and x-d1 are in the dictionary. Then, we iterate over each distinct d1, and for each voucher in d1, we do two queries (each O(log n_d2)). \n\n        The total work is: for each distinct d1 (that satisfies the condition) we do (number of vouchers in d1) * 2 * (log(number of vouchers in d2)).\n\n        And the sum of the sizes of all groups is 200000, so the total work is 200000 * 2 * log(200000) which is acceptable.\n\n        But note: we must be cautious because the same voucher might appear in two different groups? No, each voucher has one duration.\n\n        Steps for this alternative:\n\n          Precomputation:\n\n            Group the vouchers by duration -> duration_dict: {d: list of (l, r, cost)}\n\n            For each duration d that is in the dictionary, we build:\n\n                Option1_structure[d] = (sorted_list_by_l, suffix_min)   # sorted_list_by_l: list of (l, r, cost) sorted by l, and suffix_min[i] = min(cost from i to end)\n\n                Option2_structure[d] = (sorted_list_by_r, prefix_min)   # sorted_list_by_r: list of (l, r, cost) sorted by r, and prefix_min[i] = min(cost from 0 to i)\n\n            Also, we need to know the entire set for each duration d.\n\n          Then, let S be the set of durations that are in the dictionary and such that (x - d) is also in the dictionary.\n\n          Then, for each d1 in S:\n\n            d2 = x - d1\n\n            Now, we want to combine the two sets: set1 = duration_dict[d1], set2 = duration_dict[d2]\n\n            We want to consider every voucher i in set1, and then for each i, we do two queries on set2:\n\n                Query1: in set2, find a voucher j such that l_j > r_i (using Option1_structure[d2]: sorted by l and suffix_min)\n                Query2: in set2, find a voucher j such that r_j < l_i (using Option2_structure[d2]: sorted by r and prefix_min)\n\n            Then, the candidate total cost for i is cost_i + (minimal cost from Query1 or Query2, whichever is found and is minimal).\n\n            Then, we take the minimum candidate total cost over all i and both queries.\n\n          However, we must avoid using the same voucher twice. But note: the two sets are for durations d1 and d2. If d1 == d2, then set1 and set2 are the same set. Then, we must not use the same voucher. \n\n          But wait: the problem says two distinct vouchers. So if d1==d2, then we are taking two vouchers from the same set. We must ensure that the two vouchers are distinct.\n\n          In the query for set2 (which is the same as set1) we must not pick the same voucher i. \n\n          How to handle this?\n\n          We can do:\n\n            For d1 == d2:\n\n                We have to ensure that the voucher j in set2 is not the same as voucher i.\n\n            We can store the vouchers along with an id? Or we can store the entire list and then when querying, we can remove the voucher i from consideration.\n\n          But then, if we remove one voucher, the structure changes. \n\n          Alternatively, we can precompute for each duration d (even for d1 != d2, we don't need to remove anything) and for d1==d2, we can precompute two structures for the set: one that is the entire set, and then we can do:\n\n            candidate1 = the minimal cost from set2 for l > r_i, but if that minimal cost voucher is i itself, then we have to look for the next minimal cost.\n\n          However, we don't know which voucher is which. \n\n          We can store the vouchers with their original index? \n\n          Since the problem does not require to output which vouchers, only the minimal cost, and we are only concerned with the cost, we can do:\n\n            For set2 (which is the same as set1) for a given voucher i, we want to consider set2 without i.\n\n          But building a separate structure for each removal is too expensive.\n\n        Alternatively, we can change the way we query: \n\n          We are storing for set2 (for duration d) two sorted arrays: one by l and one by r.\n\n          Then, we can store the entire set2 and then when we want to exclude a particular voucher i (which is in set1 and set2 is the same as set1) we can:\n\n            In Option1_structure for set2 (sorted by l): we know the l_i and r_i of voucher i. Then, we can do:\n\n                Query1: minimal cost for set2 (excluding i) with l > r_i.\n\n                How? We can query the entire set2 for l>r_i, and then if the minimal cost voucher in that query is i, then we remove i and re-query? \n\n          But we cannot do that repeatedly.\n\n        Another idea: Precompute for each duration d the two structures (entire set). Then, for d1==d2, we can:\n\n            candidate1_total = query set2 (entire) for l>r_i -> gives a minimal cost, say c1.\n\n            candidate2_total = query set2 (entire) for r<l_i -> gives a minimal cost, say c2.\n\n            Then, if the voucher i is the one that gave c1 (or c2) then we need to find the next best.\n\n          But we don't know if the minimal cost voucher is i.\n\n        We can store the entire set2 and then for each voucher i (from set1) we do:\n\n            candidate1_entire = query set2 (entire) for l>r_i -> returns (min_cost1, voucher_list1) but we don't know which voucher.\n\n        Without knowing the voucher, we cannot decide if it is i.\n\n        Therefore, we need to store the vouchers with their identity. But the problem doesn't require the identity, only the minimal cost.\n\n        We can do: \n\n            For each duration d, we store the list of (l, r, cost) and also we assign an arbitrary unique id to each voucher.\n\n            Then, when building the Option1_structure for d, we store (l, r, cost, id) and then when querying, we get the minimal cost and the id of the voucher that achieved it.\n\n            Then, if d1 == d2 and the queried minimal cost voucher has id equal to the id of voucher i, then we have to find the next minimal cost voucher that is not i.\n\n            How to do that?\n\n            We can store in the Option1_structure for d: \n\n                sorted_by_l = sorted([(l, r, cost, id)], key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n                Then, we can create a suffix_min array that stores the minimal cost and the corresponding id? Or we can store two arrays: one for the sorted list and one for the minimal cost and then do a secondary structure for the same duration d that allows removal of one voucher.\n\n        But then, we have to do this for every distinct duration d, and then the memory and time might be high.\n\n        Considering the constraints (n=200000) and that the total distinct durations is at most 200000, but the total number of vouchers is 200000, we can do:\n\n            For each duration d, we store:\n\n                list1 = sorted([(l, r, cost, id)], key=lambda x: x[0])\n                Then, we build an array for the entire list: \n                    arr1 = [ (l, r, cost, id) for ... ]\n\n                Then, we build a suffix_min array for the cost, but also we want to know the next best if the best is removed.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use a heap for each duration d for Option1? But we have to query by l>r_i.\n\n        This seems too heavy.\n\n        Let me reconsider the initial idea: \n\n          We are going to iterate over each voucher i (each occurrence) and then query the complementary duration d_t = x - d_i.\n\n          Then, the total work is O(n * log(n_d_t)) which is acceptable if n_d_t is not too large.\n\n          But then, we have to handle the case when d_i == d_t and the minimal cost voucher in d_t (for the query) is the same as voucher i.\n\n          How to handle that?\n\n          We can do:\n\n            For each duration d, we build two structures (for Option1 and Option2) for the entire set.\n\n            Then, when processing a voucher i (with duration d_i) and d_t = x - d_i, we:\n\n                If d_i != d_t:\n                    candidate1 = query1(d_t, r_i)   # minimal cost in d_t for l>r_i\n                    candidate2 = query2(d_t, l_i)   # minimal cost in d_t for r<l_i\n\n                Else (d_i == d_t):\n                    candidate1 = query1(d_t, r_i)   # minimal cost in d_t for l>r_i, but we don't know if it's i\n                    candidate2 = query2(d_t, l_i)   # minimal cost in d_t for r<l_i\n\n                    Then, we must check if the voucher i appears in the result of candidate1 or candidate2.\n\n                    But wait: the query1 and query2 are defined on the entire set of d_t, and if the minimal cost voucher in candidate1 (for l>r_i) is voucher i, then we cannot use it.\n\n                    However, note: if d_i == d_t, then the query for candidate1 (l>r_i) is asking for a voucher j in d_t with l_j > r_i. But voucher i has l_i and r_i. Since the voucher i has duration d_i = d_t, we know that r_i = l_i + d_i - 1. \n\n                    Now, is it possible that l_i > r_i? No, because l_i <= r_i. And the condition for candidate1 is l_j > r_i. But l_i is the start of voucher i, and r_i = l_i + d_i - 1. \n\n                    We have to check: is it possible that voucher i satisfies l_i > r_i? No, because d_i>=1 so r_i = l_i + d_i - 1 >= l_i.\n\n                    Then, for candidate1: we require l_j > r_i. But voucher i has l_i <= r_i, so voucher i does not satisfy l_j > r_i. Therefore, even if we did not remove voucher i, the query for candidate1 would not return voucher i.\n\n                    Similarly, for candidate2: we require r_j < l_i. Voucher i has r_i = l_i + d_i - 1, which is >= l_i, so r_i >= l_i. But the condition is r_j < l_i. Again, voucher i has r_i >= l_i, so it does not satisfy r_j < l_i.\n\n                    Therefore, when d_i == d_t, the voucher i itself does not qualify for either candidate1 or candidate2 in the complementary set (because the condition for candidate1 is l_j > r_i, and for candidate2 is r_j < l_i, and voucher i has l_i <= r_i and r_i >= l_i, so it fails both).\n\n                    So we don't have to remove voucher i from the set for d_t! \n\n          Why is that?\n\n          Because the condition for non-overlap requires that the two intervals do not overlap. But if we use the same voucher i twice, then the intervals would be [l_i, r_i] and [l_i, r_i] which definitely overlap (unless the duration is 0, but duration>=1). So the problem requires two distinct vouchers, but even if they were the same, the non-overlap condition would fail (they overlap). \n\n          Therefore, we don't have to worry about using the same voucher twice because:\n\n            - If d_i != d_t, then the two vouchers are from different durations and cannot be the same.\n\n            - If d_i == d_t, then the same voucher i cannot satisfy the non-overlap condition (as shown above).\n\n          So we can ignore the possibility of using the same voucher twice.\n\n        Therefore, we can proceed with:\n\n          Step 1: Group by duration.\n\n          Step 2: For each duration d that is in the dictionary, build:\n\n                Structure1: (list_sorted_by_l, suffix_min) for the entire set of vouchers of duration d.\n\n                Structure2: (list_sorted_by_r, prefix_min) for the entire set of vouchers of duration d.\n\n          Step 3: Let S be the set of durations d such that d is in the dictionary and x-d is also in the dictionary.\n\n          Step 4: Initialize best_total = a very large number (or infinity).\n\n          Step 5: For each voucher i in the entire list (we can iterate over the grouped list or the original list) we do:\n\n                d_i = (voucher i's duration)\n                d_t = x - d_i\n\n                If d_t not in duration_dict, skip.\n\n                Then, we do:\n\n                    candidate1 = None\n                    candidate2 = None\n\n                    Using Structure1 for d_t: \n                        We want the minimal cost for a voucher j in d_t with l_j > r_i.\n\n                        How? \n                            In the sorted list by l for d_t, we find the first index where l_j > r_i (using bisect_right). Then, if there is at least one, candidate1 = suffix_min[index] (which is the minimal cost from that index to the end).\n\n                    Similarly, Using Structure2 for d_t:\n                        We want the minimal cost for a voucher j in d_t with r_j < l_i.\n\n                        In the sorted list by r for d_t, we find the last index where r_j < l_i (using bisect_left-1). Then, candidate2 = prefix_min[index] (if index>=0).\n\n                    Then, if candidate1 is not None and candidate2 is not None:\n                        candidate_total = min(cost_i + candidate1, cost_i + candidate2)\n\n                    If only one is not None, then candidate_total = the one that is not None.\n\n                    Then, update best_total = min(best_total, candidate_total)\n\n          Step 6: If best_total remains the initial large value, output -1, else output best_total.\n\n        But wait: we are iterating over each voucher i, and then for each i we are querying d_t. However, the same pair (i, j) might be considered twice? \n\n          Example: \n            Consider two vouchers i and j, with durations d_i and d_j such that d_i + d_j = x, and they don't overlap.\n\n            We will consider:\n\n                When i is processed: we look for d_t = x - d_i = d_j, and we find j (if j satisfies the non-overlap condition) and candidate_total = cost_i + cost_j.\n\n                When j is processed: we look for d_t = x - d_j = d_i, and we find i (if i satisfies the non-overlap condition) and candidate_total = cost_j + cost_i.\n\n            So we are counting the same pair twice.\n\n          How to avoid duplication?\n\n          We can enforce an order: only consider a pair (i, j) if, say, l_i < l_j or something? But the non-overlap condition is not symmetric in terms of ordering.\n\n          Alternatively, we can iterate only over one half of the pairs. But note: the two durations d1 and d_t might be different, so we are already iterating over all vouchers. \n\n          But note: the problem does not require to output the pair, only the minimal cost. And if we count the same pair twice, then we are just updating best_total twice with the same value. It doesn't harm, but it is inefficient.\n\n          However, the total number of vouchers is 200000, and each query is O(log n_d_t), so the total work is O(n * log(max_n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two distinct travel vouchers such that the sum of their durations equals exactly `x` (the total vacation days), and the vouchers do not overlap in time. The goal is to minimize the total cost of these two vouchers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This allows us to efficiently access all vouchers of a specific duration when needed.\n2. **Preprocess Structures for Efficient Queries**: For each duration, we preprocess two structures:\n   - **Structure1**: Sorted by the start day (`l`) and a suffix-min array to quickly find the minimal cost voucher starting after a given day.\n   - **Structure2**: Sorted by the end day (`r`) and a prefix-min array to quickly find the minimal cost voucher ending before a given day.\n3. **Iterate Over Vouchers**: For each voucher, calculate its complementary duration (`x - duration`). If such a duration exists in the grouped list, perform queries on the corresponding structures to find the minimal cost voucher that does not overlap with the current voucher.\n4. **Update Minimum Cost**: Track the minimal total cost encountered during the iteration. If no valid pair is found, return -1.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom bisect import bisect_right, bisect_left\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n        \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    vouchers = []\n    index = 2\n    for i in range(n):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        cost_val = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost_val))\n        \n    duration_dict = {}\n    for (l, r, cost_val) in vouchers:\n        d = r - l + 1\n        if d not in duration_dict:\n            duration_dict[d] = []\n        duration_dict[d].append((l, r, cost_val))\n        \n    structures = {}\n    for d in duration_dict:\n        lst = duration_dict[d]\n        sorted_by_l = sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        sorted_by_r = sorted(lst, key=lambda y: y[1])\n        \n        l_vals = [item[0] for item in sorted_by_l]\n        r_vals = [item[1] for item in sorted_by_r]\n        costs = [item[2] for item in lst]\n        \n        suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_l)\n        if sorted_by_l:\n            min_cost_so_far = float('inf')\n            for i in range(len(sorted_by_l)-1, -1, -1):\n                if costs[i] < min_cost_so_far:\n                    min_cost_so_far = costs[i]\n                suffix_min[i] = min_cost_so_far\n                \n        prefix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_r)\n        if sorted_by_r:\n            min_cost_so_far = float('inf')\n            for i in range(len(sorted_by_r)):\n                if costs[i] < min_cost_so_far:\n                    min_cost_so_far = costs[i]\n                prefix_min[i] = min_cost_so_far\n                \n        structures[d] = {\n            'sorted_by_l': sorted_by_l,\n            'suffix_min': suffix_min,\n            'l_vals': l_vals,\n            'sorted_by_r': sorted_by_r,\n            'prefix_min': prefix_min,\n            'r_vals': r_vals\n        }\n        \n    best_total = float('inf')\n    \n    for (l, r, cost_i) in vouchers:\n        d_i = r - l + 1\n        d_t = x - d_i\n        if d_t < 1 or d_t not in structures:\n            continue\n            \n        cand1 = None\n        cand2 = None\n        \n        s_by_l = structures[d_t]['sorted_by_l']\n        l_vals_arr = structures[d_t]['l_vals']\n        suffix_min_arr = structures[d_t]['suffix_min']\n        pos1 = bisect_right(l_vals_arr, r)\n        if pos1 < len(l_vals_arr):\n            cand1 = suffix_min_arr[pos1]\n            \n        s_by_r = structures[d_t]['sorted_by_r']\n        r_vals_arr = structures[d_t]['r_vals']\n        prefix_min_arr = structures[d_t]['prefix_min']\n        pos2 = bisect_left(r_vals_arr, l)\n        if pos2 > 0:\n            cand2 = prefix_min_arr[pos2-1]\n            \n        if cand1 is not None and cand2 is not None:\n            total1 = cost_i + cand1\n            total2 = cost_i + cand2\n            candidate_total = min(total1, total2)\n            if candidate_total < best_total:\n                best_total = candidate_total\n        elif cand1 is not None:\n            if cost_i + cand1 < best_total:\n                best_total = cost_i + cand1\n        elif cand2 is not None:\n            if cost_i + cand2 < best_total:\n                best_total = cost_i + cand2\n                \n    if best_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(best_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers, each characterized by start day, end day, and cost.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped into a dictionary where keys are durations and values are lists of vouchers with that duration.\n3. **Structure Preprocessing**: For each duration, two structures are built:\n   - **Sorted by Start Day**: Allows efficient lookup of vouchers starting after a specific day using binary search and a suffix-min array to get the minimal cost.\n   - **Sorted by End Day**: Similarly, allows efficient lookup of vouchers ending before a specific day using binary search and a prefix-min array.\n4. **Query Processing**: For each voucher, the complementary duration is calculated. Using the preprocessed structures, the algorithm checks for non-overlapping vouchers that meet the duration requirement and updates the minimal cost accordingly.\n5. **Output**: The minimal total cost is printed if valid vouchers are found; otherwise, -1 is printed indicating no solution exists. \n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using grouping and preprocessing, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
