There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\nWe are to find the maximum number of games the winner can take part in, given that two players can play only if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\nObservation:\nIn a knockout tournament, the total number of games is n-1 (each game eliminates one player until one remains). However, we are focusing on the winner's path.\n\nLet k be the maximum number of games the winner plays. Then, the winner must win k consecutive games.\n\nThe constraint: when the winner has won i games (so he has played i games), then the next opponent must have played either i-1, i, or i+1 games? Actually, note the rule: \"two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played.\"\n\nBut note: the winner is playing his k-th game. Before that, he has played k-1 games. So his next opponent must have played either k-2, k-1, or k? Actually, wait: the rule says \"the number of games one of them has already played\" so for the k-th game, the winner has k-1, and the opponent must have a number of games that is either k-2, k-1, or k.\n\nHowever, we are trying to maximize k. How does the tournament structure work?\n\nWe can think recursively. Let f(k) be the minimum number of players required to have a winner who plays k games.\n\nIn the last game (the k-th game), the winner must play against an opponent. The opponent must have played either k-2, k-1, or k games. But note: the opponent must have been present in the tournament and won all their games.\n\nActually, the entire tournament must have a structure such that the winner's opponents are chosen from groups of players with similar numbers of previous games.\n\nAlternatively, we can model the tournament as a binary tree, but the rule allows a non-standard pairing (as long as the condition holds).\n\nLet me consider:\n\n- In the first game, the winner (player 1) plays one opponent. Then he has 1 game.\n\n- For the second game, the winner must play someone. The opponent must have 0 or 1 game. But the opponent could be a player that just started (0 games) or a player that already won one game (from a different branch). However, if we have more than two players, we can set up the tournament in two halves.\n\nBut note: the example input 4 gives output 2.\n\nHow does that work?\nWith 4 players: \n  We can have two initial games: (1 vs 2) and (3 vs 4). Then the winners (1 and 3) play. \n  So the winner (say 1) plays 2 games.\n\nBut why not 3 games? Because we only have 4 players. After the first two games, we have two winners. Then one more game to determine the champion. That makes 2 games for the champion.\n\nNow, what about 5 players? \n\nWe want to maximize the number of games the winner plays. We can structure it as:\n\nRound 1: \n  We can have two matches: (1 vs 2) and (3 vs 4). Then one player remains (player 5). \n\nBut wait, we cannot leave a player out arbitrarily because the tournament is knockout. Actually, we must use a single-elimination format. However, the rule allows for flexibility in the grid.\n\nActually, the problem states: \"assuming the rule above is used\". We are to arrange the grid arbitrarily (as long as the rule is satisfied) to maximize the winner's games.\n\nAnother way: we can build the tournament by having two subtrees of a certain size.\n\nLet F(k) be the minimum number of players needed for a champion to win k games.\n\nIn the k-th game, the champion (who has played k-1 games) will face an opponent. The opponent must have played either k-2, k-1, or k games.\n\nBut note: the opponent must be a player that has survived k-1 games (if the opponent has played k games, then the opponent is the champion of a subtree that took k games). However, we are the champion, so we are going to win again and then we'll have k games.\n\nBut how many players are required?\n\nConsider:\n\n- The champion must play k games. So he must defeat k opponents.\n\nEach opponent comes from a distinct part of the tournament. Moreover, the tournament can be divided into:\n\n  - The champion's own path: which requires k wins.\n\n  - The opponents: each opponent must have won a certain number of games (at least k-2, because the rule: when the champion is at k-1, the opponent must have between k-2 and k).\n\nActually, we can set up the tournament as:\n\n  To have a champion with k games, we need:\n\n    - One player (the champion) that wins k games.\n    - k opponents, each from a different subtree.\n\nBut the subtrees must be arranged so that the number of games the opponents have played is appropriate.\n\nHowever, note the rule: the champion and the opponent must have a difference of at most one. So when the champion is at the k-th game, the opponent must have played between k-2 and k games.\n\nBut the champion's path is fixed: he starts at 0, then after first win has 1, then 2, etc.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet g(x) be the minimum number of players required to have a champion that plays x games.\n\nBase cases:\n  g(0) = 1   [no game, just the champion]\n  g(1) = 2   [champion and one opponent]\n\nFor k >= 2, the champion's last opponent must have played between k-2 and k games. However, we want to minimize the total number of players, so we would use the smallest possible subtrees that satisfy the condition.\n\nBut note: the champion must have played k games, so he must have defeated k opponents. Each opponent must come from a separate subtree.\n\nIn the k-th game, the opponent must have played either:\n  Option 1: k-2 games (then that opponent's subtree requires g(k-2) players, but note: the opponent is the root of a subtree that has k-2 wins, so the entire subtree has g(k-2) players)\n  Option 2: k-1 games (then the opponent's subtree requires g(k-1) players)\n  Option 3: k games (then the opponent's subtree requires g(k) players)\n\nBut wait, we are building the minimal configuration for k games. We need to consider that the champion's k wins require k distinct opponents. However, the entire tournament is built from these subtrees.\n\nActually, we can break down the tournament as:\n\n  The champion must have a subtree of his own (which is the entire path) and then the k opponents must come from independent subtrees.\n\nBut the condition also applies during the construction of the tournament.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of the tournament as having a structure that is balanced by the rule. This is similar to a binary tree but with a twist.\n\nWe can use recursion:\n\ng(0) = 1\ng(1) = 2\n\nFor k >= 2, the minimal number of players for a champion to win k games is the minimal way to combine the champion's k wins with the requirement that the last opponent has played between k-2 and k games.\n\nBut note: the champion must defeat k opponents. However, the entire tournament has the champion and the k opponents, and then the players that fed into those opponents.\n\nBut here's a known approach for similar problems (like CodeForces problems involving knockout tournaments with constraints):\n\nWe can define:\n\n  Let a_k be the maximum number of players we can arrange such that the winner plays at most k games? Or maybe the minimal players for k games.\n\nActually, we are given n (number of players) and we want the maximum k such that there exists a tournament with n players and the winner plays k games.\n\nBut note: the problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner can take part in.\n\nWe can use a greedy/dynamic programming approach:\n\nDefine:\n  dp[k] = the minimal number of players required to have a champion with k wins.\n\nThen, we have:\n  dp[0] = 1   (the champion alone)\n  dp[1] = 2   (champion and one opponent)\n\nFor k >= 2, the champion must have played k-1 wins already, and the k-th game must be against an opponent that has played either k-2, k-1, or k wins.\n\nBut note: the champion's k wins require k opponents. However, the opponent in the k-th game must be the root of a subtree that has a certain number of wins.\n\nActually, we can model the entire tournament as:\n\n  The champion must defeat k opponents. Each opponent must be the champion of a subtree that has a certain size.\n\nBut the condition for the k-th game: the opponent must have played either k-2, k-1, or k games. So the opponent's subtree must have been built to require that the champion of that subtree has at least k-2 wins (or exactly k-2, k-1, or k?).\n\nWait, actually the opponent's number of wins is the number of games they have won, which is the same as the depth of the subtree they came from.\n\nBut note: the entire tournament might not be symmetric.\n\nHowever, we are allowed to arrange arbitrarily. Therefore, we can use the following recurrence:\n\n  dp[k] = 1 + dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]   ?\n\nBut wait, let's check with k=2:\n\n  dp[2] = 1 + dp[1] + dp[0] = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.\n\nWhich matches the sample: n=4 -> answer=2.\n\nWhat about k=3:\n\n  dp[3] = 1 + dp[2] + dp[1] = 1 + 4 + 2 = 7.\n\nSo with 7 players, the champion can win 3 games.\n\nBut let's see: \n  In the first two games, we have two matches: one match produces the champion (with 1 win) and another match produces a player with 1 win (from the other side). Then, we have the third game where the champion (with 1 win) must play someone. But wait, the rule says the opponent must have 0, 1, or 2 wins? \n\nWait, the champion has 1 win (so k=2: two wins total, so after the third game he will have 3 wins). Actually, we are counting the number of wins (games played) for the champion.\n\nActually, the recurrence I wrote is:\n\n  dp[k] = 1 + dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]\n\nBut let me explain:\n\n  The entire tournament is built from:\n    - The champion (1 player)\n    - The left subtree: which is a tournament that produces a champion that will eventually meet the current champion in the last (k-th) game. But wait, actually the last game is the k-th, so the left subtree should be the one that provides the opponent for the k-th game.\n\n  However, the condition for the k-th game: the opponent must have played either k-2, k-1, or k games. But we are building the minimal configuration.\n\n  Actually, we can build the tournament in two parts:\n\n    Part 1: The champion's first k-1 games. This requires dp[k-1] players (but wait, no: the entire tournament for k-1 wins is dp[k-1], but that includes the champion and his opponents from the first k-1 wins).\n\n  Alternatively, we can think:\n\n    The champion must defeat k opponents. The k opponents must come from k independent tournaments. But the condition is that when the champion is at the i-th game, the opponent must have at most i-1 games? Actually, the condition is that the difference is at most one.\n\n  Another known problem: the maximum number of wins for a champion in a knockout tournament with n players, under the condition that the bracket is arranged optimally, is found by solving a recurrence.\n\n  There is a known recurrence for this problem (similar to the \"Tennis Championship\" problem on CodeForces):\n\n      dp[0] = 1\n      dp[1] = 2\n      for k>=2: dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]\n\n  But wait, that's the Fibonacci sequence. Actually, from the examples:\n\n      n=2 -> dp[1] = 2 -> k=1 -> answer=1 (but wait, our dp[k] is the minimal number of players for k wins, so for k=1 we need 2 players, for k=2 we need 4, for k=3 we need 7.\n\n  Now, if we are given n, we want the maximum k such that dp[k] <= n.\n\n  But note: the problem says:\n      Input: n (number of players)\n      Output: the maximum number of games the winner can take part in.\n\n  So we are to find the maximum k such that dp[k] <= n.\n\n  Then, the answer is k.\n\n  Let me test with the examples:\n\n      Example: n=2 -> k=1 -> dp[1]=2 <=2 -> answer=1. Correct.\n\n      Example: n=3 -> we look for k: \n          dp[0]=1<=3 -> k>=0\n          dp[1]=2<=3 -> k>=1\n          dp[2]=4>3 -> so maximum k is 1? But the example input 3 gives output 2.\n\n  Wait, that doesn't match.\n\n  Alternatively, note that the example input 3 gives output 2.\n\n  So let me reexamine:\n\n  The example input 3: n=3.\n\n  We can have a tournament with 3 players:\n\n    Option 1: \n        First game: player1 vs player2 -> player1 wins (now player1 has 1 game)\n        Then, we have two players: player1 and player3. Now, can player1 (with 1 game) play against player3 (with 0 games)? Yes, because |1-0|<=1.\n\n        Then, the champion (player1) has played 2 games.\n\n  So the answer is 2.\n\n  But according to the recurrence above (dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2] + 1? or without the +1?), we had:\n\n      dp[0]=1\n      dp[1]=2\n      dp[2]=4\n\n  Then for n=3, we would have k=1 because dp[2]=4>3, so we cannot have k=2.\n\n  This is a contradiction.\n\n  Let me redefine:\n\n  The recurrence I thought initially was:\n\n      dp[k] = 1 + dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]\n\n  Then:\n      dp[0]=1\n      dp[1]=2\n      dp[2]=1+dp[1]+dp[0]=1+2+1=4\n      dp[3]=1+dp[2]+dp[1]=1+4+2=7\n\n  But wait, the example n=3: we have 3 players, so we must have a tournament that uses 3 players and the winner plays 2 games.\n\n  How does that fit into the recurrence? \n\n  Actually, the recurrence I defined is for the minimal number of players required to have a champion with k wins.\n\n  Then, for k=2, we need at least 4 players. But we have 3, so we cannot have a tournament for 3 players that results in 2 wins for the champion? \n\n  But we just did: we had two games (the champion played two games). However, wait: the total number of players is 3, but the tournament structure we built used all three. \n\n  Let me break down:\n\n      Game1: Player1 vs Player2 -> Player1 wins (Player2 eliminated). Now we have two players: Player1 and Player3.\n      Game2: Player1 vs Player3 -> Player1 wins.\n\n      This tournament has 3 players and the champion (Player1) played 2 games.\n\n  So the minimal number of players for k=2 should be 3? \n\n  But wait, the recurrence I defined was:\n\n      dp[k] = 1 + dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]\n\n  Why did we add dp[k-1] and dp[k-2]? \n\n  Explanation for the recurrence (if we use the standard interpretation for some similar problems):\n\n      To have a champion with k wins, we must have:\n\n        - The champion himself: 1 player.\n\n        - The two subtrees: one providing the champion's first k-1 wins, and the other providing the opponent for the k-th win.\n\n      But note: the condition for the k-th game: the opponent must have played between k-2 and k games.\n\n      However, we don't know which one to choose. To minimize the total number of players, we choose the smallest subtree that satisfies the condition.\n\n      But wait, the two subtrees are independent. The entire tournament is the union of:\n\n        - The champion (1 player)\n        - The tournament that produced the champion's first k-1 wins (which requires dp[k-1] players)\n        - The tournament that produced the opponent for the k-th win (which must be a champion from a subtree that has at least k-2 wins, but we can use the minimal configuration for k-2, k-1, or k wins? Actually, to minimize the total, we use the minimal configuration for k-2 wins, because then the opponent's subtree is as small as possible.\n\n      However, note: the condition is that the opponent must have between k-2 and k wins. So we can use any of the three. But to minimize the total players, we choose the smallest one, which is dp[k-2] (if k>=2).\n\n      Then, the recurrence would be:\n\n          dp[k] = 1 + dp[k-1] + min(dp[k-2], dp[k-1], dp[k])\n\n      But wait, we don't know dp[k] yet (we are defining it). Actually, we are building from the bottom up.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use the idea that the entire tournament is composed of:\n\n          - The champion (1)\n          - A subtree that gives the champion his first k-1 wins (which is a full tournament of dp[k-1] players, but wait: no, because the champion's first k-1 wins are achieved by defeating k-1 opponents, and each opponent comes from a subtree. Actually, the minimal structure for k wins is:\n\n            The champion must defeat k opponents. Each opponent must be the champion of a subtree. And the condition on the last opponent is that the opponent has between k-2 and k wins.\n\n      But note: the entire tournament must have the champion and all the opponents and the players that feed into the opponents.\n\n      Actually, the minimal structure for k wins is:\n\n          We break the tournament into two parts:\n\n            Part 1: The champion's first k-1 wins. This requires a tournament that has the champion and k-1 opponents, but note: the condition must hold for every game.\n\n          This is getting complex.\n\n  After reading similar problems (like CodeForces problem \"Tennis Championship\"), I recall that the answer is related to the Fibonacci numbers.\n\n  However, the example n=3 -> answer=2, n=4->answer=2, but wait:\n\n      n=2: answer=1\n      n=3: answer=2\n      n=4: answer=2\n\n  Actually, the sample outputs are:\n\n      Input: ['2', '3', '4', '10'] -> Output: ['1','2','2','4']\n\n  So for n=10, the answer is 4.\n\n  How does that relate to Fibonacci?\n\n      Let F(0)=1, F(1)=2, F(2)=3? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use a different recurrence.\n\n  Known fact: In a knockout tournament, the maximum wins for the champion is the floor of log2(n) in a normal binary tournament. But here the rule is more flexible.\n\n  However, the rule allows for a structure that is not strictly balanced. We can use:\n\n      Let f(1) = 1\n      Let f(2) = 2\n      Then, for n players, the maximum number of wins is the maximum k such that the total number of players required for k wins is <= n.\n\n  The recurrence for the minimal number of players for k wins is:\n\n      dp[0] = 1\n      dp[1] = 2\n      dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]   [without the +1?] \n\n  Then:\n\n      dp[0] = 1\n      dp[1] = 2\n      dp[2] = dp[1] + dp[0] = 2+1=3\n      dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] = 3+2=5\n      dp[4] = dp[3] + dp[2] = 5+3=8\n      dp[5] = dp[4] + dp[3] = 8+5=13\n\n  Now, check:\n\n      n=2: dp[1]=2 <=2 -> k=1, but we can get k=2 for n=3 (dp[2]=3<=3) so for n=3, k=2.\n\n      Then for n=4: \n          dp[2]=3 <=4 -> k>=2\n          dp[3]=5 >4 -> so k=2. Matches.\n\n      For n=10:\n          dp[0]=1<=10 -> k>=0\n          dp[1]=2<=10 -> k>=1\n          dp[2]=3<=10 -> k>=2\n          dp[3]=5<=10 -> k>=3\n          dp[4]=8<=10 -> k>=4\n          dp[5]=13>10 -> so k=4.\n\n      This matches the sample.\n\n  Now, let me verify with n=3: \n      dp[0]=1<=3 -> k>=0\n      dp[1]=2<=3 -> k>=1\n      dp[2]=3<=3 -> k>=2\n      dp[3]=5>3 -> so maximum k=2.\n\n  So the recurrence is:\n\n      dp[0] = 1\n      dp[1] = 2\n      for k>=2: dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]\n\n  Then, we are given n, and we want the maximum k such that dp[k] <= n.\n\n  However, note: the recurrence is the Fibonacci sequence starting from:\n\n      dp[0] = 1\n      dp[1] = 2\n      dp[2] = 3\n      dp[3] = 5\n      dp[4] = 8\n      dp[5] = 13\n\n  This is the Fibonacci sequence shifted (starting index 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...). The standard Fibonacci is F0=0, F1=1, F2=1, F3=2, F4=3, F5=5, F6=8, ...\n\n  Here, dp[k] = Fib(k+2) ? \n\n      Fib(2) = 1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, Fib(7)=13.\n\n      dp[0]=1 -> Fib(2)=1 -> k=0 -> Fib(0+2)=Fib(2)=1\n      dp[1]=2 -> Fib(3)=2 -> k=1 -> Fib(1+2)=Fib(3)=2\n      dp[2]=3 -> Fib(4)=3 -> k=2 -> Fib(4)=3\n      dp[3]=5 -> Fib(5)=5 -> k=3 -> Fib(5)=5\n\n  So dp[k] = Fib(k+2) (if we define Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, ...) then Fib(k+2) is:\n\n      Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, ...\n\n  Therefore, we need to find the maximum k such that Fib(k+2) <= n.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      1. Precompute the Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n (n can be up to 10**18, so we need an efficient way: linear or logarithmic? Actually, we can iterate until we exceed n).\n\n      2. Since the Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, the maximum k will be around 100 (because Fib(100) is huge, but 10**18 is about the 90th Fibonacci number?).\n\n      3. We'll generate Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n, and count the index.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use:\n\n      dp = [0]*(max_n+1)   # but n is up to 10**18, so we cannot allocate an array of size 10**18.\n\n  Instead, we can use a loop that generates Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n.\n\n  Algorithm:\n\n      a, b = 1, 2   # dp0=1, dp1=2\n      k = 0\n      while a <= n:\n          print(k)   # but wait, we want the maximum k for which dp[k] <= n, so we break when a becomes greater than n, then the answer is k-1? \n\n      Actually, we are generating dp[k] = a, and we want the maximum k such that a<=n.\n\n      Steps:\n\n          k0: k=0 -> a=1 (dp0) -> count k0\n          k1: k=1 -> a=2 (dp1) -> count k1\n          k2: k=2 -> a=3 (dp2) -> count k2\n          ...\n\n      We can do:\n\n          fib0 = 1\n          fib1 = 2\n          k = 0\n          while fib0 <= n or fib1 <= n:\n              if fib0 <= n:\n                  k = 0\n                  fib0 = 1\n                  fib1 = 2\n              else:\n                  break\n              # Then we iterate.\n\n      Better:\n\n          fib_prev = 1   # k-2\n          fib_curr = 2   # k-1\n          k = 1          # we have k=1 (because fib_curr is for k=1)\n\n          We want to find the largest k such that fib_k <= n, where fib_k = dp[k] = Fib(k+2) (with Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, ...)\n\n          But note: \n            dp0 = 1 = Fib(2) = 1\n            dp1 = 2 = Fib(3) = 2\n            dp2 = 3 = Fib(4) = 3\n            dp3 = 5 = Fib(5) = 5\n\n          So we are generating the Fibonacci numbers starting from index 2.\n\n          We can generate:\n\n            fib0 = 1   (for k=0: Fib(2))\n            fib1 = 2   (for k=1: Fib(3))\n\n          Then for k=2: fib2 = fib0 + fib1 = 3 (Fib(4))\n          Then for k=3: fib3 = fib1 + fib2 = 2+3=5 (Fib(5))\n\n          We want to count the k (the index in dp) for which fib_i <= n.\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            k = 0\n            a = 1\n            b = 2\n            while True:\n                if b > n:\n                    break\n                else:\n                    k = 1   # for the next step we are going to update a and b, but we want to remember the last k that was <= n?\n                    a, b = b, a+b\n\n          Alternatively, we can count the number of steps.\n\n          We want the maximum k such that dp[k] <= n.\n\n          dp[0]=1, dp[1]=2, dp[2]=3, dp[3]=5, ...\n\n          We can iterate and count the index.\n\n          Let:\n\n            fibs = [1, 2]\n            k = 0\n            while fibs[-1] <= n:\n                k += 1\n                next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]   # because the last two: for index k, we need the two previous ones.\n                fibs.append(next_fib)\n\n            Then the answer is k-1? \n\n          But wait, we start with k=0 (fibs[0]=1) and then k=1 (fibs[1]=2). Then we add k=2 (fibs[2]=3) and so on.\n\n          Actually, the list fibs will have the values for dp[0] to dp[i] (with i being the last index that is <=n). But we are appending until the last one exceeds n.\n\n          Then the maximum k is the index of the last fibs element that is <= n.\n\n          However, note: we are including dp[0] and dp[1] as the first two.\n\n          Example n=2:\n\n            Start: fibs=[1,2]\n            Check 1<=2 -> yes, then k=0 (we haven't incremented for the first two?

Then k=1 -> answer=1. Correct.\n\n            For n=3:\n                a=1, b=2 -> 2<=3 -> k=1, then a=2, b=3.\n                Then 3<=3 -> k=2, then a=3, b=5.\n                Then 5<=3 -> no, so break.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by no more than one. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the tournament structure must allow the winner to play as many games as possible while adhering to the given constraint. The solution involves finding the largest number of games (k) such that the minimal number of players required for a champion to win k games does not exceed the given number of players (n).\n\n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of players required for a champion to win k games follows a Fibonacci-like sequence. Specifically, the sequence starts with 1 player for 0 wins and 2 players for 1 win. For k ≥ 2, the minimal players required is the sum of the minimal players required for k-1 and k-2 wins. This is because each subsequent game requires combining two subtrees of previous game counts.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We generate the sequence of minimal players required for increasing numbers of wins (k) until the value exceeds the given n. The largest k for which the minimal players ≤ n is our answer.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently generates the sequence in O(k) time, where k is the maximum number of wins. Given that n can be as large as 10^18, the sequence grows exponentially, so k is at most around 100, making the approach feasible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        a, b = 1, 2\n        k = 0\n        while b <= n:\n            a, b = b, a + b\n            k += 1\n            \n        print(k)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input integer n, representing the number of players.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If n is 1, the output is 0 since a single player cannot participate in any games (though the problem constraints ensure n ≥ 2).\n3. **Sequence Generation**: The variables `a` and `b` are initialized to 1 and 2, representing the minimal players required for 0 and 1 wins, respectively. The loop continues to generate subsequent Fibonacci numbers (summing `a` and `b`) and increments `k` (the number of wins) until `b` exceeds n.\n4. **Output**: The value of `k` is printed, which is the maximum number of games the winner can play under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the properties of the Fibonacci sequence to determine the solution without resorting to brute-force methods, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of n.",
