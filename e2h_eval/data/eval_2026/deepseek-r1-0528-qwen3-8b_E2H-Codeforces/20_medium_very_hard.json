For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem.\n\n We are given three integers: n, k, f.\n\n We have to assign a value c_s for every binary string s of length from 1 to n (note: the example includes strings of length 1 to n, but note that the multiset consists of strings of length exactly n). However, the condition is defined for every prefix s (which can be of any length from 1 to n). \n\n The beautiful condition for a multiset M of binary strings of length exactly n is:\n   For every binary string t (which is a prefix, and we consider all prefixes of length from 1 to n), \n        the number of strings in M that have t as prefix <= c_t.\n\n Note: The multiset M is of fixed-length n strings. So a string of length n has prefixes of all lengths from 1 to n.\n\n Now, what is the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset? Let F be that maximum size.\n\n We are to count the number of ways to choose the integers c_s (for every binary string s of length 1 to n) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\n Observation:\n\n The problem is about assigning the constraints (c_s) and then the maximum multiset size that satisfies the constraints.\n\n How to think about the maximum multiset size?\n\n Consider that each string in the multiset is of length n. Each string is represented by a binary string of length n.\n\n The constraint for a string s (as a prefix) of length L (1<=L<=n) is that the count of strings in the multiset that start with s must be <= c_s.\n\n Notice: The entire multiset is built from strings of length n. The constraint for a prefix s of length L is independent of the constraints for other prefixes, but note that the same string of length n must satisfy all the constraints for every prefix.\n\n However, note that the condition for the prefix s of length L is also inherited by its extensions. For example, if a string starts with s (so s is a prefix of the entire string), then it must satisfy the constraint for s. But also, if we consider a shorter prefix, say s' (a prefix of s), then the same string must satisfy the constraint for s' as well.\n\n But note: The condition for the multiset is defined for every prefix s (of length from 1 to n). Therefore, for a multiset M, for each string x in M, and for each prefix s of x (which is of length from 1 to |x| = n), we require that the count for s (the total number of strings in M that have s as prefix) does not exceed c_s.\n\n However, note that the same string x will be counted in every prefix of itself. \n\n How to maximize the multiset?\n\n The multiset is built from strings of length n. We can think of the multiset as being built from the leaves of a complete binary tree of depth n (each node corresponds to a prefix).\n\n The constraint for a node (prefix) s is that the total number of strings in the multiset that have s as prefix must be <= c_s.\n\n But note: The set of strings that have s as prefix is exactly the set of strings that start with s and then have n-|s| more bits. In the multiset, we can include multiple copies of the same string? The problem says \"multiset\", so yes.\n\n However, note that the constraint for a longer prefix is more restrictive because the same string must satisfy all constraints. For example, consider two constraints:\n   For prefix \"0\": we cannot have more than c_0 strings that start with \"0\".\n   For prefix \"00\": we cannot have more than c_00 strings that start with \"00\".\n\n But note: The strings that start with \"00\" are a subset of the strings that start with \"0\". So the constraint for \"00\" might be tighter.\n\n How to build the maximum multiset?\n\n We can use a greedy idea: we want to assign as many strings as possible without violating any constraint. However, the constraints are interdependent.\n\n Alternatively, note that the entire multiset is built from the leaves (strings of length n). Each leaf is at depth n. The constraint for a node s (at depth d) is that the number of leaves in the subtree rooted at s must be <= c_s.\n\n But note: the multiset can have repeated strings? The problem does not say distinct, so we can have duplicates. Then the condition for a node s is that the total frequency of all leaves in the subtree of s must not exceed c_s.\n\n However, wait: the condition is defined for every prefix. And the multiset is built from strings of length n. The condition for a prefix s (of length d) is that the total number of strings (counting multiplicities) that have s as prefix is <= c_s.\n\n Now, if we allow duplicates, then we can put the same string multiple times. But note: the condition for the prefix s is independent of the condition for other prefixes. However, the same string (say, \"0\" repeated n times) would be counted under every prefix of itself.\n\n Now, what is the maximum multiset size? It is the maximum number of strings (with repetition allowed) such that for every prefix s, the total count of strings having s as prefix is at most c_s.\n\n This is similar to a problem of building a multiset of leaves in a full binary tree (with depth n) such that for each node, the sum of the multiplicities of the leaves in its subtree is at most c_s (the assigned constraint for that node).\n\n However, note: we are free to assign the c_s arbitrarily (from 0 to k). And then we are to count the assignments such that the maximum multiset size is exactly f.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f\".\n\n So, first we need to understand: for a fixed assignment of c_s (for all 2^n - 1 nodes? Actually, note: the problem says \"every binary string s of length from 1 to n\", so there are (2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n) = 2^(n+1)-2 nodes.\n\n How to compute the maximum multiset size for a fixed assignment of c_s?\n\n We can use a greedy algorithm that builds the multiset from the root downward, but note: the condition for a node s is that the total number of strings (leaves) in the subtree of s (i.e., the set of strings that have s as prefix) must be <= c_s. However, the same leaf (string) is included in the subtree of every one of its prefixes.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a flow-like argument or independent conditions. However, note that the constraints are nested: the constraints for a node and its parent are independent? Actually, they are not: the parent's constraint must hold for the entire subtree (including the children) and the child's constraint is a part of that.\n\n But note: we are allowed to assign the constraints arbitrarily (from 0 to k). Then the maximum multiset size is determined by the constraints.\n\n In fact, the maximum multiset size is the minimum over all nodes s of c_s * (the number of leaves in the subtree of s)? Not exactly.\n\n Actually, consider: each leaf (string of length n) is associated with n+1 constraints (one for each prefix). The total multiset is the same as assigning multiplicities to the leaves, but then the constraint for a node s is the sum of the multiplicities of all leaves in the subtree of s must be <= c_s.\n\n This is a system of linear constraints. The maximum total multiplicity (i.e., the total number of strings, counting multiplicities) is limited by the most restrictive constraint? Actually, no: because the same multiplicity is used in multiple constraints.\n\n However, note: the entire multiset is built from leaves, and the constraint for a node s is the sum of the multiplicities of the leaves in the subtree of s. Then the maximum total multiplicity is the minimum over all chains of constraints? Actually, we can use the following:\n\n Let T be the full binary tree of depth n (each node has two children). Then the maximum multiset size is the minimum value of c_s over all nodes s? No, because the root constraint (c_root) must be at least the total number of leaves (each leaf is in the root's subtree). Similarly, the constraint for a node at depth d must be at least the total number of leaves in its subtree.\n\n But note: the constraints are independent, and we are free to assign them arbitrarily. However, the maximum multiset size is determined by the entire assignment.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: what is the maximum multiset size? It is the maximum integer X such that we can assign multiplicities to the leaves (each leaf a string of length n) so that for every node s, the sum of the multiplicities of the leaves in the subtree of s is <= c_s.\n\n This is a classic problem: the maximum multiplicity is the minimum over all subtrees of (the constraint of the root of that subtree) but note: the constraints are set arbitrarily. Actually, the maximum multiset size is the minimum value of c_s over all nodes s? No, because the root constraint must be at least the total multiplicity (since the entire multiset is in the root's subtree). Similarly, the constraint for a node s must be at least the total multiplicity of the leaves in its subtree.\n\n However, we can also consider: if we set the constraint for a node s to be very small, then the entire subtree of s is limited by that. But note: the multiset must satisfy all constraints.\n\n There is a known result in the theory of hierarchical constraints: the maximum total multiplicity is the minimum over all nodes s of c_s, but wait, that is not true.\n\n Example: n=2. The root (empty string? but note: our strings are from length 1 to n, but the problem says the multiset contains strings of length n. Actually, note: the problem says \"binary string s of length from 1 to n\" for the prefixes. However, the entire multiset is of length n. The root (empty string) is not considered because the problem says \"for every binary string s of length from 1 to n\". So actually, the constraints are only for the non-empty prefixes? \n\n Wait, the example: n=2, and they consider s=\"0\", s=\"1\", s=\"00\", s=\"01\", s=\"10\", s=\"11\". So the constraints are defined for every non-empty string (since the empty string is not included). But note: the multiset is built from strings of length n=2. Then the condition for a prefix of length 1 (like \"0\") is that the total number of strings (in the multiset) that start with \"0\" is <= c_0. Similarly, the condition for a prefix of length 2 (like \"00\") is that the total number of strings that are exactly \"00\" is <= c_00.\n\n However, note: the condition for the prefix \"0\" also includes the strings \"00\" and \"01\". So the constraint for \"0\" is the sum of the counts for \"00\" and \"01\". Similarly, the constraint for \"00\" is just the count for \"00\".\n\n Therefore, the constraints are not independent. We can write:\n\n Let the multiset M be a vector of 2^n nonnegative integers (each representing a string of length n). Then the constraint for a prefix s (which is a node at depth d) is:\n\n   For s of length d, the constraint is: \n        Sum_{t: t starts with s} [count(t)] <= c_s\n\n But note: the entire multiset M is the set of counts for the leaves (each leaf is a string of length n). The constraints for the internal nodes are the sums over the leaves in their subtree.\n\n Now, we wish to maximize the total sum (which is the total number of strings) under the constraints.\n\n However, we are free to assign the c_s arbitrarily (each c_s from 0 to k) and then the maximum multiset size is determined by the constraints.\n\n How do we compute the maximum multiset size for a given assignment of c_s? \n\n We can use a greedy allocation from the bottom up? Or from the top down? \n\n Alternatively, note: the system of constraints is:\n\n   For each node s (each prefix) of length d (1<=d<=n): \n        Let T(s) be the set of leaves (full strings) that have s as prefix. Then:\n            Sum_{x in T(s)} m(x) <= c_s\n\n We wish to maximize the total sum S = sum_{x} m(x).\n\n This is a linear programming problem with an exponential number of variables and constraints. However, the structure is a tree and the constraints are nested.\n\n We can use a min-cut like formulation or rely on the fact that the constraints are hierarchical.\n\n Another observation: the maximum total multiplicity S is bounded by the minimum of the constraints along any path from the root to a leaf? Actually, no.\n\n However, note that the root constraint (for the empty string? but we don't have the empty string) is not defined. We have constraints for every prefix of length 1 to n.\n\n Actually, the constraints are:\n\n   For the root's children (the two nodes of length 1): \n        c_0 >= (number of strings in the left subtree) and similarly for c_1.\n\n   But note: the entire multiset is the union of the two subtrees (left and right). The root constraint is not present because we don't consider the empty string.\n\n Let me reframe: we have a complete binary tree of depth n (each node has two children, and the leaves are at depth n). The constraints are for every node (except the root? but note: the problem considers every string of length 1 to n, so the root (if we consider the empty string) is not included. But wait, the problem does not consider the empty string. So the constraints are for every node that is at depth 1 to n.\n\n However, the condition for a node s (at depth d) is that the total multiplicity of the leaves in its subtree is <= c_s.\n\n Now, the entire multiset is the set of leaves. The total multiplicity is the sum of the multiplicities of all leaves.\n\n The constraints for the internal nodes (non-leaves) must be satisfied. Moreover, the leaves themselves are constrained by their own c_s (the leaf node constraint is just the multiplicity of that leaf).\n\n Then, the maximum total multiplicity is the minimum over all nodes s of c_s? Not necessarily.\n\n Example: n=1. Then we have two leaves (two strings of length 1). The constraints are for the two nodes (each of length 1). The total multiplicity is the sum of the two leaves. But the constraint for the first leaf is c_0, and for the second leaf is c_1. Also, there are no internal nodes. However, note: the condition for the prefix \"0\" is that the number of strings that start with \"0\" is <= c_0. But the only string that starts with \"0\" is the leaf \"0\". Similarly for \"1\". So the maximum multiset size is the minimum of c_0 and c_1? Actually, no: we can have at most c_0 copies of \"0\" and c_1 copies of \"1\", so the total is c_0 + c_1? But wait, the condition for the prefix \"0\" requires that the total for \"0\" is <= c_0, and for \"1\" <= c_1. So the maximum multiset size is indeed c_0 + c_1.\n\n But wait, that doesn't match the example: in the example input \"1 42 2\", the output is 3. \n\n Let me read the example again: \n   Input: \"1 42 2\"\n   Output: 3\n\n Explanation: The three ways to choose the integers c_s are:\n      c_0 = 0, c_1 = 2 -> then the maximum multiset size is 0+2 = 2.\n      c_0 = 1, c_1 = 1 -> then the maximum multiset size is 1+1 = 2.\n      c_0 = 2, c_1 = 0 -> then the maximum multiset size is 2+0 = 2.\n\n So the condition is that the maximum multiset size is exactly 2.\n\n How do we relate the assignment of c_s to the maximum multiset size?\n\n In the case n=1, the maximum multiset size is simply c_0 + c_1.\n\n But wait, in the example the multiset is {1,1} for the second case. But note: the multiset is of strings of length 1. So we have two distinct strings: \"0\" and \"1\". The multiset can contain duplicates. So the multiset is built from two types: \"0\" and \"1\". The constraint for \"0\" is the count of \"0\" (all copies of \"0\") and for \"1\" is the count of \"1\".\n\n Therefore, the maximum multiset size is the sum of the two constraints? Actually, no: because the constraint for \"0\" is the total count of \"0\", and the constraint for \"1\" is the total count of \"1\". Then the maximum multiset size is the sum of the two constraints? But note: the multiset is the set of strings, and each string is either \"0\" or \"1\". So the maximum multiset size is indeed the sum of the two constraints.\n\n However, wait: the problem states that the multiset is built from strings of length n. In the example n=1, the multiset is built from strings of length 1. So the entire multiset is the set of \"0\"s and \"1\"s.\n\n But note: the condition for the prefix \"0\" is that the total number of strings (which are of length 1) that start with \"0\" is <= c_0. Since the only string of length 1 that starts with \"0\" is \"0\", the condition is that the count of \"0\" is <= c_0. Similarly, the condition for \"1\" is that the count of \"1\" is <= c_1.\n\n Then the maximum multiset size is the sum of the two constraints? Actually, no: the multiset is the union of the two, but the two constraints are independent. The maximum multiset size is the sum of the two constraints, because we can have up to c_0 zeros and c_1 ones.\n\n However, wait: the example says that the maximum multiset size is 2 in the three cases. In the first case: c_0=0, c_1=2 -> maximum multiset size = 0+2 = 2. Second: 1+1=2. Third: 2+0=2.\n\n So the maximum multiset size is the sum of the constraints for the leaves? Not exactly: the leaves are the nodes of length 1, and we have two leaves. But what if n>1?\n\n Consider n=2. Then we have four leaves (strings of length 2). The constraints are for:\n   \"0\": which covers the leaves \"00\" and \"01\"\n   \"1\": which covers the leaves \"10\" and \"11\"\n   \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\"\n\n The condition for \"0\": the total number of leaves that start with \"0\" (i.e., \"00\" and \"01\") must be <= c_0.\n Similarly, for \"1\": <= c_1.\n\n For \"00\": the number of \"00\" is <= c_00.\n For \"01\": the number of \"01\" is <= c_01.\n For \"10\": the number of \"10\" is <= c_10.\n For \"11\": the number of \"11\" is <= c_11.\n\n Now, we wish to maximize the total multiset size: the sum of the counts for \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\".\n\n But note: the constraints for the internal nodes (length 1) are:\n        count(\"00\") + count(\"01\") <= c_0\n        count(\"10\") + count(\"11\") <= c_1\n\n And the leaf constraints are:\n        count(\"00\") <= c_00\n        count(\"01\") <= c_01\n        count(\"10\") <= c_10\n        count(\"11\") <= c_11\n\n Then the maximum total is the minimum between:\n        (c_0 + c_1)   [if we ignore the leaf constraints?] \n        and the sum of the leaf constraints? \n\n Actually, we can set:\n        count(\"00\") = min(c_00, c_0)   [but wait, we have two constraints on \"00\": from the internal node \"0\" and the leaf node \"00\"]\n        Similarly for others.\n\n However, note: the leaf constraints are independent and the internal constraints are the sum of two adjacent leaves.\n\n The maximum total multiset size is the minimum between:\n\n        c_0 + c_1   (because the two halves must add up to the total, and we cannot exceed the internal constraints)\n\n        and the sum of the leaf constraints? \n\n Actually, no: because the leaf constraints might be smaller than the internal ones. But note: the leaf constraint for \"00\" is independent and must be satisfied. However, the total for the left half (from \"0\") is the sum of \"00\" and \"01\", which must be <= c_0. Similarly, the leaf \"00\" is part of the left half and must be <= c_00, and similarly for \"01\".\n\n So the maximum for the left half is the minimum between c_0 and the sum of the two leaves (but the two leaves individually are constrained by c_00 and c_01). \n\n Actually, we can set:\n        count(\"00\") = min(c_00, c_0, c_0 - count(\"01\"))   ??? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the following: the maximum total multiset size is the minimum of:\n\n        c_0 + c_1,   (from the two internal nodes)\n        c_00 + c_01 + c_10 + c_11,   (from the leaves) ?\n\n But wait, the leaves are four, and the internal nodes are two. The constraints are:\n\n        c_0 >= count(\"00\") + count(\"01\")\n        c_1 >= count(\"10\") + count(\"11\")\n        c_00>=count(\"00\")\n        c_01>=count(\"01\")\n        c_10>=count(\"10\")\n        c_11>=count(\"11\")\n\n Then the maximum total is the minimum over all these constraints? Not exactly: because the same count(\"00\") appears in two constraints.\n\n Actually, we can set:\n\n        count(\"00\") <= min(c_00, c_0)   [but also the left half total is bounded by c_0]\n        count(\"01\") <= min(c_01, c_0)\n        count(\"10\") <= min(c_10, c_1)\n        count(\"11\") <= min(c_11, c_1)\n\n Then the total multiset size is at most min(c_0+c_1, c_00+c_01+c_10+c_11) but also the individual leaves are bounded by the internal node? \n\n Actually, the maximum total is the minimum between:\n\n        (c_0 + c_1)   [from the two internal nodes] \n        and the sum of the leaf constraints (if we consider that we can assign up to c_00 for \"00\", etc.)?\n\n But note: the leaf constraints are independent and the internal constraints are the sum of two leaves.\n\n However, we cannot assign more than c_00 to \"00\", so the left half (which includes \"00\" and \"01\") is bounded by c_0 and also by c_00 + c_01 (if we ignore the individual leaf constraints, but we are forced to use the leaf constraints).\n\n Actually, the maximum for the left half is min(c_0, c_00 + c_01) but wait, we cannot exceed the leaf constraints. So the left half is bounded by min(c_0, c_00 + c_01) and similarly the right half by min(c_1, c_10+c_11). Then the total multiset size is min(c_0, c_00+c_01) + min(c_1, c_10+c_11).\n\n But wait, that is not necessarily the case: we could have c_00=1, c_01=2, c_0=3. Then the left half can have at most 3, but also the two leaves can have at most 1+2=3. So we can assign 3 to the left half. However, if c_0=2, then even though the leaves can have up to 3, we are limited by the internal constraint to 2.\n\n So the left half is bounded by min(c_0, c_00+c_01) and the right half by min(c_1, c_10+c_11). Then the total is the sum of these two.\n\n However, note: the leaf constraints are independent and the internal constraint is the sum of the two leaves. So the maximum for the left half is min(c_0, c_00+c_01) and for the right half min(c_1, c_10+c_11). Then the total maximum multiset size is min(c_0, c_00+c_01) + min(c_1, c_10+c_11).\n\n But wait, we also have the leaf constraints individually? Actually, the leaf constraints are already taken into account when we say c_00+c_01 (because we cannot assign more than c_00 to \"00\" and more than c_01 to \"01\"). However, note: the constraint for \"00\" is independent, but the way we combine the two leaves is by adding their counts. \n\n However, note: the leaf constraints are independent and the internal constraint is the sum. So the maximum for the left half is the minimum between the internal constraint and the sum of the leaf constraints. But wait, the leaf constraints might force a lower bound? Actually, no: the leaf constraints are upper bounds, and the internal constraint is also an upper bound. The maximum for the left half is the minimum of the internal constraint and the sum of the leaf constraints? Actually, no: the leaf constraints are per leaf, so the maximum for the left half is the minimum of the internal constraint and the sum of the leaf constraints, but we are not forced to use the leaf constraints to form the left half. \n\n Actually, we are free to assign any nonnegative integers to the leaves as long as the leaf constraint is not exceeded and the internal constraint is not exceeded.\n\n Therefore, the maximum for the left half is min(c_0, c_00+c_01) is not correct. Because we might not be able to assign the entire c_00+c_01 if the leaf constraints are broken. Actually, we can assign at most c_00 for \"00\" and c_01 for \"01\", so the maximum for the left half is min(c_0, c_00+c_01). Similarly for the right.\n\n But wait: what if the leaf constraints are very tight? Then we cannot assign more than c_00 for \"00\", so the left half cannot exceed c_00+c_01 (by the leaf constraints) and also cannot exceed c_0 (the internal constraint). So the left half is bounded by min(c_0, c_00+c_01). Similarly, the right half by min(c_1, c_10+c_11). Then the total multiset size is the sum of these two.\n\n However, note: the entire multiset is the left half and the right half. So the maximum multiset size is min(c_0, c_00+c_01) + min(c_1, c_10+c_11).\n\n But wait: what if we consider the entire tree? The constraints for the leaves are independent and the internal constraints are the sum of the children. Then the maximum total is the sum over all nodes of the constraints for the leaves? Actually, we can generalize:\n\n For a complete binary tree of depth n, the maximum multiset size is the minimum value of c_s for all nodes s? \n\n Let me test with n=2:\n\n   Total multiset size = min(c_0, c_00+c_01) + min(c_1, c_10+c_11)\n\n   But note: the root (if we consider the empty string) is not included. The constraints are for the nodes of length 1 and 2.\n\n   However, we can also consider the entire tree: the constraint for the root (if we had it) would be the total sum, and then we would have:\n\n        min(c_empty, c_0+c_1) \n\n   But the problem does not include the empty string.\n\n   So we are only considering the constraints for the nodes of length 1 to n.\n\n   Now, note: the leaves (nodes of length n) are included, and the internal nodes (length 1 to n-1) are included.\n\n   The maximum multiset size is the sum of the minimums for each branch? Actually, no: because the constraints are hierarchical and the same leaf is contained in multiple constraints.\n\n   However, we can use the following: the maximum multiset size is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * (number of leaves in the subtree of s))? \n\n   But wait, that would be the product of the constraint and the size of the subtree? That doesn't make sense.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a tree DP: \n\n   Let F(s) be the maximum total multiplicity in the subtree of s (the leaves that are in the subtree of s). Then:\n\n        F(s) = min( c_s, F(left_child(s)) + F(right_child(s)) )   [if s is an internal node]\n\n   But wait, for a leaf node s (depth n), then F(s) = min(c_s, 0) ? Actually, the leaf node has no children, so the subtree only contains itself. Then F(s) = min(c_s, 0) is not right.\n\n   Actually, for a leaf node (at depth n), the constraint is that the count for that leaf is <= c_s. But note: the leaf is also constrained by its parent (if exists) and by all its ancestors. However, we are building from the bottom up.\n\n   But note: the constraint for the leaf is independent and the parent constraint is the sum of the two leaves. \n\n   Actually, the maximum multiset size for the entire tree is the minimum value over the entire tree of the constraints, but weighted by the subtree size? \n\n   Let me define:\n\n        Let T(s) be the subtree of s (if s is at depth d, then the subtree has 2^(n-d) leaves).\n\n        Then, the constraint for s is that the total multiplicity of the leaves in T(s) is <= c_s.\n\n        We wish to maximize the total multiplicity.\n\n        We can use a greedy: we start from the leaves and go upward.\n\n        At a leaf, the maximum multiplicity we can assign to that leaf is c_s (the leaf constraint). But then the parent constraint (which is the sum of the two children) must be satisfied.\n\n        We can set:\n\n           Let dp[s] = the maximum total multiplicity we can assign to the subtree of s, given the constraint c_s.\n\n        Then for a leaf s (depth n): dp[s] = min(c_s, ...) but wait, the leaf has no children. Actually, the leaf is the base. But note: the leaf is constrained by c_s and is not further broken down. However, the leaf is also constrained by the parent (which is the node of length n-1) that requires the sum of the two leaves (this leaf and its sibling) to be <= c_parent. But we are building from the bottom up.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n          For a node s (non-leaf) at depth d (with two children l and r):\n\n              dp[s] = min(c_s, dp[l] + dp[r])\n\n          But wait, this would be if we are propagating the maximum multiplicity from the children to the parent, and the parent constraint is an absolute limit.\n\n        Then the total multiset size is dp[root]? But we don't have a root (empty string). Actually, we have the two children of the root (the two nodes of length 1). Then the total multiset size is dp[\"0\"] + dp[\"1\"].\n\n        For a leaf s (depth n): dp[s] = min(c_s, ...) but wait, the leaf has no children, so we don't add anything. However, the leaf is constrained by c_s, but also by the parent. But the parent will take care of the leaf's contribution.\n\n        Actually, we can define:\n\n          For a leaf s (depth n): dp[s] = c_s   [but then the parent will combine]\n\n        Then for an internal node s:\n\n          dp[s] = min(c_s, dp[left_child(s)] + dp[right_child(s)])\n\n        Then the total multiset size is dp[\"0\"] + dp[\"1\"].\n\n        Example for n=1 (leaf nodes are the two children of the root? Actually, for n=1, the nodes of length 1 are the leaves. Then we don't have a parent? \n\n        We must adjust: for n=1, the nodes are of length 1 (leaves). Then we don't have internal nodes. Then we would define dp[s] = c_s for each leaf. Then the total multiset size is the sum of the two leaves? But wait, the multiset is built from leaves, and the constraints for the leaves are independent. However, the condition for the prefix \"0\" (which is the leaf \"0\") is that the count of \"0\" is <= c_0. Similarly for \"1\". And there is no parent constraint for the leaves. \n\n        But wait, the problem states that the multiset is beautiful if for every prefix s (which are the leaves and the parents? but for n=1, the parents would be the empty string, but the problem does not consider the empty string). So the constraints are only for the leaves (the two nodes of length 1). Then the maximum multiset size is the sum of the two constraints? \n\n        However, the above dp for n=1 would be:\n\n            For leaf \"0\": dp[\"0\"] = c_0\n            For leaf \"1\": dp[\"1\"] = c_1\n            Then the total multiset size = dp[\"0\"] + dp[\"1\"] = c_0 + c_1.\n\n        But wait, the parent of these leaves (the root) is not considered. \n\n        Now, for n=2:\n\n            Leaves: \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\"\n\n            Internal nodes: \"0\", \"1\"\n\n            Then:\n                dp[\"00\"] = c_00\n                dp[\"01\"] = c_01\n                dp[\"10\"] = c_10\n                dp[\"11\"] = c_11\n\n            Then for node \"0\":\n                dp[\"0\"] = min(c_0, dp[\"00\"]+dp[\"01\"]) = min(c_0, c_00+c_01)\n\n            For node \"1\":\n                dp[\"1\"] = min(c_1, c_10+c_11)\n\n            Then the total multiset size = dp[\"0\"] + dp[\"1\"] = min(c_0, c_00+c_01) + min(c_1, c_10+c_11)\n\n        Now, compare with the condition: the multiset must satisfy the leaf constraints and the internal constraints. \n\n        This dp formulation gives the maximum multiset size.\n\n        Why is that? \n\n        We are saying: the maximum multiplicity we can put in the subtree of a node s is the minimum between the constraint c_s and the sum of the maximum multiplicities we can put in its children's subtrees.\n\n        This matches the conditions.\n\n        Therefore, the maximum multiset size for a given assignment of c_s is:\n\n            F = sum_{x in the set of leaves} (the value propagated from the leaf) but wait, we are doing a tree DP from leaves to the root.\n\n        However, note: the leaves are the nodes of length n, and the internal nodes are of length 1 to n-1.\n\n        Then the maximum multiset size is the sum of the two values at the root's children (the two nodes of length 1). \n\n        But wait, the root's children are the two nodes of length 1, and they are internal nodes (if n>=2). Then we don't have a root (empty string) constraint.\n\n        Actually, the entire multiset is the set of leaves, and the constraint for a node s is the sum of the multiplicities of the leaves in its subtree. The dp formulation ensures that the constraint for each node is not violated.\n\n        Therefore, the maximum multiset size is computed by:\n\n            Let T be the complete binary tree of depth n (with 2^n leaves).\n\n            For each leaf s (node of length n): \n                dp[s] = c_s   [but wait, in the dp recurrence we did not use the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to assign integers \\( c_s \\) for every binary string \\( s \\) of length from 1 to \\( n \\) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly \\( f \\). A beautiful multiset is defined as a multiset of binary strings of length exactly \\( n \\) where, for every prefix \\( s \\), the number of strings in the multiset that start with \\( s \\) does not exceed \\( c_s \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves assigning constraints \\( c_s \\) to all binary prefixes of length 1 to \\( n \\). The maximum multiset size is determined by the sum of the minimum values between each parent's constraint and the sum of its children's constraints. This forms a hierarchical structure where each node's constraint depends on its children's constraints.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The maximum multiset size can be computed using a dynamic programming approach on a binary tree. Each leaf (string of length \\( n \\)) contributes its \\( c_s \\) value. For internal nodes, the maximum contribution is the minimum of the node's constraint and the sum of its children's contributions.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a recursive function to compute the number of valid assignments. The function checks if the current node's constraints can be satisfied given the subtree's constraints. The solution leverages combinatorial mathematics to count valid assignments efficiently.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves iterating over all possible constraints for each node, which is feasible because \\( n \\) is at most 15. The use of modular arithmetic ensures that large numbers are handled correctly under modulo \\( 998244353 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k_val = int(data[1])\n    f_val = int(data[2])\n    \n    total_nodes = (1 << (n + 1)) - 3\n    total_leaves = 1 << n\n    \n    def comb(n, r):\n        if r < 0 or r > n:\n            return 0\n        if r == 0 or r == n:\n            return 1\n        num = 1\n        den = 1\n        for i in range(1, r + 1):\n            num = num * (n - i + 1) % MOD\n            den = den * i % MOD\n        return num * pow(den, MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD\n\n    def solve_tree(depth, total_children, max_constraint, min_required):\n        if depth == n:\n            return comb(max_constraint, min_required)\n        \n        total_ways = 0\n        for left in range(0, max_constraint + 1):\n            right = total_children - left\n            if right < 0 or right > max_constraint:\n                continue\n            ways_left = solve_tree(depth + 1, total_children, left, min_required)\n            ways_right = solve_tree(depth + 1, total_children, right, min_required)\n            total_ways = (total_ways + ways_left * ways_right) % MOD\n        return total_ways\n\n    def count_assignments(max_multiset_size, n, k_val):\n        total = 0\n        for x in range(0, max_multiset_size + 1):\n            term1 = pow(k_val + 1, (1 << n) - 1 - x, MOD)\n            term2 = pow(k_val + 1, x, MOD)\n            total = (total + term1 * term2) % MOD\n        return total\n\n    if n == 1:\n        total_leaves = 2\n        total_assignments = 0\n        for c0 in range(0, k_val + 1):\n            for c1 in range(0, k_val + 1):\n                total_size = c0 + c1\n                if total_size == f_val:\n                    total_assignments = (total_assignments + 1) % MOD\n        print(total_assignments)\n        return\n\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        dp[i] = 2 * dp[i - 1]\n\n    min_required = f_val\n    total_ways_tree = solve_tree(0, dp[n - 1], k_val, min_required)\n\n    total_ways_all = 0\n    for i in range(0, total_nodes + 1):\n        if i <= f_val:\n            total_ways_all = (total_ways_all + pow(k_val + 1, i, MOD)) % MOD\n\n    total_ways_all = (total_ways_all * pow(k_val + 1, total_nodes - f_val - 1, MOD)) % MOD\n\n    ans = (total_ways_all - total_ways_tree) % MOD\n    if ans < 0:\n        ans += MOD\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires counting the number of ways to assign constraints \\( c_s \\) such that the maximum multiset size is exactly \\( f \\).
