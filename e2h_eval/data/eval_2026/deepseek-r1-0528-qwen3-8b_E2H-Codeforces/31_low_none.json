Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards)\n We can use any number of additional cards, each with an integer from -x to x (excluding 0? Actually including 0? But note: the problem says \"each card\" doesn't exceed x in absolute value, so from -x to x inclusive.\n\n However, note: the problem says that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x. So we can use any integer in that range arbitrarily many times.\n\n We are to find the minimum number of additional cards such that the sum of all found cards (including the additional ones) is zero.\n\n Let S be the sum of the found cards.\n\n Then we need to choose k additional cards (each between -x and x) such that their sum is -S, and we want the smallest k.\n\n How to think?\n We are allowed to choose any numbers in [-x, x]. So the maximum absolute value we can contribute with one card is x.\n\n Note: We can also use zeros, but zeros don't help. So we are interested in non-zero contributions.\n\n The idea:\n Let T = -S (the target sum for the additional cards)\n\n We want the minimum k such that we can represent T as the sum of k numbers, each in the range [-x, x].\n\n However, note that the entire set of available numbers is symmetric. We can consider:\n\n 1. If T == 0, then we need 0 additional cards.\n 2. Otherwise, we have to cover T with k cards.\n\n But note: k cards can have total sum in the range [-k*x, k*x]. So if |T| > k*x, then k cards cannot achieve T.\n\n However, we are looking for the minimum k. Also note that we can use both positive and negative numbers.\n\n Actually, we can reframe: we want the minimum k such that there exists integers a1, a2, ..., ak in [-x, x] with sum = T.\n\n This is equivalent to: the maximum absolute value we can get with k cards is k*x, so we require |T| <= k*x.\n\n But is that sufficient? Not exactly. We must be able to form T.\n\n However, note that with k cards, the set of achievable sums is every integer between -k*x and k*x that has the same parity as k*x (if we consider only using ±x, but wait: we can use any integers in [-x,x]). Actually, because we can use any integer in [-x,x] (so we can adjust by 1), the set of achievable sums is actually every integer between -k*x and k*x, provided that k >= ceil(|T|/x) [because the maximum absolute sum is k*x]. \n\n Why? Consider: We can use the following greedy idea: \n   We can set the first k-1 cards to x (if T is positive) and then the last card to T - (k-1)*x, which must be in [-x, x]. Similarly for negative.\n\n However, note that we can mix positive and negative. Actually, the minimal k must satisfy |T| <= k*x.\n\n But is that condition sufficient? \n\n Example: T=1, x=1, k=1: then 1 is in [-1,1] -> yes.\n Example: T=2, x=1, k=2: then we can do 1+1=2 -> yes.\n\n However, what about T=3, x=2, k=2: then 3 is not in [-4,4]? Actually, 3<=4 so condition holds, but can we form 3 with two cards? Each card can be at most 2, so maximum is 4. But 3: we can do 2+1, but wait: 1 is allowed because |1|<=2. So yes.\n\n Actually, since we can use any integers from -x to x, then we can adjust by 1. Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition is |T| <= k*x.\n\n However, wait: is that always true? What about T=1, x=1000, k=1: yes. T=0, k=0: yes.\n\n But consider: we are allowed to use any integers, so the step size is 1. Then the set of sums we can form is every integer between -k*x and k*x. Why? Because we can use zeros and ones to adjust by 1. However, note: we are constrained by the individual card values being at most x in absolute value.\n\n Actually, the set of achievable sums is indeed every integer between -k*x and k*x. \n\n Proof sketch: \n   We can start with k zeros (sum 0). Then we can change some zeros to 1 or -1 to adjust the sum by 1. However, we are limited",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his found cards equals zero. Each additional card can have any integer value between -x and x (inclusive). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the sum of the additional cards must exactly counterbalance the sum of the initially found cards. Let the sum of the found cards be `S`. Then, the sum of the additional cards must be `-S`. \n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of additional cards required depends on the absolute value of `S` and the maximum absolute value `x` allowed on each card. The maximum contribution per card is `x`, so the minimal number of cards needed is at least the ceiling of `|S| / x`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Calculate the total sum `S` of the found cards.\n   - If `S` is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n   - Otherwise, compute the minimal number of cards as the ceiling of `abs(S) / x`. This is because each card can contribute at most `x` towards reducing the absolute value of `S`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_sum = sum(cards)\n    if total_sum == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    k = abs(total_sum) / x\n    result = int(k) if k * x == abs(total_sum) else int(k) + 1\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of a card), followed by `n` integers representing the values on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. If this sum is zero, the answer is immediately zero since no additional cards are needed.\n3. **Determine Minimum Cards**: For a non-zero sum, the minimal number of additional cards required is calculated by dividing the absolute value of the sum by `x` and taking the ceiling of the result. This works because each card can contribute up to `x` towards balancing the sum. If the division results in an exact integer, that integer is the answer; otherwise, we need one more card to cover the remainder.\n4. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the minimal number of additional cards needed to make the total sum zero.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages mathematical insight to solve the problem with optimal performance, handling all edge cases including when the initial sum is already zero or requires just one additional card.",
