He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem:\n\n We are given two tokens in the first line: a and b. \n   - a is an integer base (2 <= a <= 25)\n   - b can be either an integer (same constraints) or the letter 'R'\n\n Then we are given a string c which is a non-negative integer in base a (with possible leading zeros, but length up to 1000). However, note that if b is 'R', then the number is guaranteed to be at most 300010 and not zero.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Convert the given string `c` from base `a` to an integer (in base 10). But note: the string may contain digits beyond '9' if a > 10? Actually, the input says \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103\". And the digits for base a (if a>10) will use letters from 'A' to ... as needed. However, note that the example input includes base 12 and digit 'A'.\n\n 2. If b is an integer (not 'R'):\n    - Convert the base-10 integer to base b. The base b must be between 2 and 25, so we can use digits 0-9 and then letters for 10 and above (but note: base 25 would require digits up to 24, so we'll map 10 to 'A', 11 to 'B', etc., up to 24 as 'O'? Actually, since base is at most 25, we need 25 distinct symbols. We can use:\n        digits = \"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n\n    But note: the example input \"12 13\\nA\" -> output 'A'. This means that when converting from base 12 to base 13, the digit 'A' (which is 10 in base 12) is converted. However, wait: the input is given in base a, and then we convert to base b. So:\n\n        Step 1: Convert the string in base a to a base-10 integer.\n        Step 2: Convert that base-10 integer to base b.\n\n    Example: \"12 R\\n5\" -> base 12, the string \"5\" is 5 in base10. Then convert 5 to Roman: 'V'.\n\n 3. If b is 'R':\n    - Convert the base-10 integer to a Roman numeral.\n\n Important: The input number in base a might be very long (up to 1000 digits) so we cannot use simple int conversion if the base is large and the string is long. However, note the guarantee: \n        - If it's Roman, the number is <= 300010 and not zero. So we can safely convert the entire string to a base10 integer by processing each digit (even if the string is long, 1000 digits, and base up to 25, the number might be huge but the problem says that in Roman case the number is at most 300010, so in the Roman case the base a conversion of the string will result in a number <= 300010. \n\n But wait: the input says \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0.\" So when b is 'R', the base10 number is at most 300010. However, in other cases the number can be as large as 10^1510? That is too big to represent as an integer in base10 in Python without using big integers? Actually, Python supports big integers, but the problem says the number can be up to 10^1510, which is a number with about 1510 digits. We have to consider that.\n\n However, note that the input representation is in base a (which is at most 25) and the string has at most 1000 digits. The maximum value in base a with 1000 digits is (a^1000 - 1). For a=25, that is 25^1000 which is astronomically huge. But the problem says that in non-Roman cases, the number is not greater than 10^1510. Wait, 10^1510 is a number with 1511 digits, but our base a is at most 25, so 25^1000 is about 10^(1000 * log10(25)) ~ 10^(1000 * 1.4) = 10^1400, which is less than 10^1510. So the guarantee for non-Roman cases is that the base10 integer is <= 10^1510.\n\n However, we are going to do two conversions:\n\n  Case 1: Non-Roman (b is integer)\n      Step 1: Convert base-a string to base10 integer. Since the string can be up to 1000 digits and base up to 25, we can use a loop that multiplies the current value by a and adds the next digit. But the number can be very large (like 10^1500) but Python integers are arbitrary precision, so we can do this.\n\n  Case 2: Roman (b is 'R')\n      Step 1: Convert base-a string to base10 integer (same as above).\n      Step 2: Convert that base10 integer (which is <= 300010) to a Roman numeral.\n\n But note: the problem says the input number in base a (for the Roman case) is at most 300010. However, the base a can be as low as 2. So the string representation in base a might be long, but the base10 integer is bounded by 300010. Therefore, we can safely convert the base-a string to base10 by processing each digit (and then the base10 integer is small enough for Roman conversion).\n\n However, there's a catch: the input string might have leading zeros. We should ignore them? Actually, the conversion algorithm for base a to base10 should handle leading zeros.\n\n Steps for converting a base-a string (with possible leading zeros) to base10:\n\n   num = 0\n   for each char in the string (from left to right? Actually, the standard is leftmost is the highest power. But note: the input is given as a string, and the problem does not specify endianness. Typically, the string is given in the usual way: the first character is the most significant.\n\n   Example: \"10 2\\n1\" -> base 10, string \"1\" -> 1 in base10.\n\n   Example: \"2 2\\n1111001\" -> base 2, string \"1111001\" -> 121 in base10. Then base b=2: we output the same string without leading zeros -> '1111001'\n\n   However, the example input \"12 13\\nA\" -> base 12, string \"A\" (which is 10) -> 10 in base10. Then base 13: 10 in base13 is represented by the digit 'A'. So output 'A'.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Let s = input string for the number.\n\n   We need to map each character to a digit value.\n\n   The characters in the string can be digits and possibly letters. The problem says: in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\n\n   How to map?\n\n     If the string contains digits and letters, we can create a mapping:\n\n        For digits: '0' to '9' -> 0 to 9\n        Then for letters: starting from 'A' (which is 10) up to the maximum needed.\n\n   But note: the base a is at most 25, so the digits used can be from '0' to the digit representing a-1. The representation of digits in base a uses:\n\n        If a <= 10: then digits are '0' to str(a-1)\n        If a > 10: then digits are '0' to '9' and then 'A' to the letter that represents a-1.\n\n   However, the input string is given in base a, so the digits must be valid in base a. But the problem says \"a non-negative integer c in base a\", so the string only contains valid digits for base a.\n\n   Steps for base-a to base10:\n\n        n = 0\n        for each character d in the string:\n            if d is a digit and less than a: then value = int(d)\n            else if d is a letter and its numeric value < a: then value = ord(d) - ord('A') + 10\n\n        But wait: what if the base is 11? Then the digits allowed are 0-9 and 'A'. The letter 'A' represents 10, which is less than 11. Similarly, base 12: digits 0-9 and 'A','B' (since 10 and 11). \n\n        However, note: the problem says the input is a non-negative integer in base a, so the digits must be in the set {digits from '0' to '9' and then from 'A' to the one that is a-1}. \n\n        But the input might mix digits and letters? Example: base 16, then digits are 0-9 and A-F.\n\n        However, the problem states: \"in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103\". And the base a is between 2 and 25.\n\n        So we can map:\n\n            char_to_value = {}\n            for i in range(10):\n                char_to_value[str(i)] = i\n            for i in range(10, a):\n                char_to_value[chr(ord('A') + i - 10)] = i\n\n        But note: if a is 11, then we need to map 'A' to 10. But if a is 10, then we don't use letters.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write a helper function to convert a digit character (which is a string of length 1) to its integer value in base a.\n\n        However, the problem says: the string may contain leading zeros, but the base a is at least 2.\n\n        Example: base 2, string \"00\" is 0.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"non-negative integer\", and the example inputs include \"1\", \"5\", etc.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Let base_a = a (the first integer)\n\n          Define a function to convert a single char d to a digit value:\n\n            if '0' <= d <= '9' and int(d) < base_a: then use int(d)\n            else if 'A' <= d <= chr(ord('A')+base_a-11) and base_a > 10: then use (ord(d) - ord('A') + 10)\n\n          But wait: what if base_a is 11, then the letter 'A' is valid. But if base_a is 10, then we don't use letters.\n\n          However, the input string is in base a, so we only get digits that are valid for base a.\n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute the mapping for all possible characters that could appear.\n\n        Since the base is at most 25, the maximum digit value is 24. So the letters go from 'A' to the 15th letter beyond '9'? Actually, from 'A' to the letter at position base_a-10.\n\n        But note: the input string might not have any letters if base_a <= 10.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            def char_to_digit(d, base):\n                if d in '0123456789':\n                    return int(d)\n                elif 'A' <= d <= chr(ord('A') + base - 11):\n                    return ord(d) - ord('A') + 10\n                else:\n                    # This should not happen because the input is valid.\n                    raise ValueError(\"Invalid digit\")\n\n        However, the problem says the input is valid, so we don't need to worry.\n\n        But note: the input string might be given with digits that are beyond the base? No, because it's a valid base a representation.\n\n        Now, after converting the entire string to a base10 integer, we have two cases:\n\n        Case 1: b is an integer (between 2 and 25)\n\n            We need to convert the base10 integer to base b.\n\n            Special case: if the base10 integer is 0, then output \"0\".\n\n            Otherwise, we convert by repeatedly dividing by b and collecting remainders.\n\n            But note: the base10 integer can be very large (up to 10^1510). However, the base b is at most 25, so the representation in base b will have many digits, but the problem says the input string for base a is up to 1000 digits, and base a is at most 25, so the base10 integer is at most 25^1000, which is huge, but we are representing it in base b (which is small). We have to use a method that works for big integers.\n\n            Steps for base10 to base b:\n\n                digits = []\n                n = base10_int\n                if n == 0:\n                    return \"0\"\n                while n:\n                    r = n % b\n                    n = n // b\n                    digits.append(r)\n\n                Then we reverse the digits and map each digit to a character.\n\n            Mapping for base b: we use the same mapping as above, but now from digit value to character.\n\n            For example, base b=16: we map 10->'A', 11->'B', ... up to 15->'F'\n\n            Since b is at most 25, we can use:\n\n                digit_map = string.digits + string.ascii_uppercase\n                Then we take the first b characters of digit_map.\n\n            But note: we need to map values from 0 to b-1.\n\n            Example: base 16: digit_map = \"0123456789ABCDEF\", then take 16 characters.\n\n            However, base 25: we need 0 to 24, so we take 25 characters: \"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQ\" (since 10 is 'A', 11='B', ... 24 is the 15th letter beyond '9': 10 is 'A', 24 is 'O').\n\n            But wait: the standard for base 25 is to use 0-9 and then A-P (since 10 to 24: 15 letters). Actually, 10 to 24 is 15 numbers, so we need 15 letters. The 15th letter is 'P' (A=10, B=11,..., P=24).\n\n            So we can define:\n\n                base_b_digits = string.digits + string.ascii_uppercase[:b]\n\n            But wait: the problem says the base is between 2 and 25, so we only need up to base 25.\n\n            However, note: the example \"12 13\\nA\" -> base12 string \"A\" (which is 10) converts to base10 10, then base13: 10 is less than 13, so we map 10 to the 11th character in the mapping (because we start from 0). But our mapping starts with '0' to '9' and then 'A' for 10. So for base13, we need 13 characters: \"0123456789ABC\" (because 0-9 and then A=10, B=11, C=12). \n\n            But wait, the example input \"12 13\\nA\" outputs 'A'. Why? Because the base10 integer is 10, and in base13, 10 is represented by the digit 'A'. So the mapping for base13 is:\n\n                0 -> '0'\n                ...\n                10 -> 'A'\n\n            So we need to map the remainder r (which is between 0 and 12) to a character. We have a list of 13 characters: ['0','1',...,'9','A','B','C'].\n\n            Therefore, we can generate the mapping for base b as:\n\n                mapping = [str(i) for i in range(10)] + [chr(ord('A') + i) for i in range(10, b)]\n\n            But wait: if b is 10, then we don't need letters. We only need digits 0-9.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                mapping = []\n                for i in range(b):\n                    if i < 10:\n                        mapping.append(str(i))\n                    else:\n                        mapping.append(chr(ord('A') + i - 10))\n\n            Then we map the remainders (which are in the range [0, b-1]) to these characters.\n\n            However, note: the remainders we get from the division are from 0 to b-1. We want to output without leading zeros.\n\n            But the algorithm for base conversion (using remainders) produces the least significant digit last, so we reverse the list.\n\n        Case 2: b is 'R'\n\n            We have a base10 integer (n) that is at most 300010 (and not zero). We need to convert n to a Roman numeral.\n\n            We can use the standard method:\n\n            Define the Roman numeral mapping for the base10 integer:\n\n                roman_numerals = [\n                    ('M', 1000),\n                    ('CM', 900), ('D', 500), ('CD', 400),\n                    ('C', 100), ('XC', 90), ('L', 50), ('XL', 40),\n                    ('X', 10), ('IX', 9), ('V', 5), ('IV', 4), ('I', 1)\n                ]\n\n            Then:\n\n                res = \"\"\n                for numeral, value in roman_numerals:\n                    count = n // value\n                    res += numeral * count\n                    n -= count * value\n\n            Example: 5 -> \"V\", 4 -> \"IV\", 9 -> \"IX\", etc.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the Roman numeral system uses subtractive notation for 4 and 9, and also for 40, 90, etc.\n\n        This mapping covers the standard Roman numerals.\n\n        But note: the problem says the number is at most 300010. Our mapping goes up to 1000 (M) and then 900 (CM) so the maximum we can represent is 300000? Actually, 300010 is within the range we cover (we have M, CM, D, etc.)\n\n        Let's test: 300010:\n\n            Break down: \n                300010 // 1000 = 300, remainder 10\n                Then 10: IX\n\n            So: CCC * 300? Actually, we break down:\n\n                MMM (3000) is 3*1000, but we have 300000: three times 100000? Wait, no: the standard Roman numerals don't have a symbol for 100000. However, the problem says the number is up to 300010, so we can break down:\n\n                300010 = 300000 + 10, but 300000 is 300 * 1000, and we don't have a symbol for 100000. \n\n            Actually, the standard way is to use multiple M's: \n                300000 would be MMM (but that's 3000, not 300000). \n\n            Correction: the standard Roman numerals use M for 1000, so 300000 is MMM followed by a bar? But the problem doesn't mention bars. \n\n            However, the problem says the number is at most 300010. The standard representation for 300000 is not defined in the problem, but note the guarantee: the number is at most 300010. So we might need to represent numbers up to 300010.\n\n            According to the mapping:\n\n                300010: \n                    M (1000): 300010 // 1000 = 300010 // 1000 = 300 with remainder 10.\n                    Then 10: IX.\n\n            But 300010 = 300 * 1000 + 10. However, 300 is broken down as:\n\n                300: CC (100) repeated 3 times? Actually, 300 is CCM? No, the standard is CCM for 300? Actually, 300 is represented as CCC.\n\n            So 300000 is represented as: MMM? (for 3000) or is it something else? \n\n            Let me clarify: the standard Roman numerals do not have a symbol for 100000, so 300000 is typically written as MMM (but that's 3000) or sometimes with a bar over M for 1000000, but the problem does not specify.\n\n            However, the problem says the number is at most 300010. The example numbers are small (like 5, 4, 1). \n\n            According to the problem statement, the subtractive principle is used for 4 and 9, and for 40, 90, etc.\n\n            We'll follow the mapping I provided, which is standard.\n\n            But note: the problem says the number is not zero, so we don't have to handle 0.\n\n        However, the example input \"5 R\\n4\" outputs \"IV\", which is correct.\n\n        But wait: the example input \"10 2\\n1\" -> base10, string \"1\" is 1, then base2: 1 in base2 is \"1\". \n\n        Another example: \"2 2\\n1111001\" -> base2, string \"1111001\" is 121 in base10. Then base2: we convert 121 to base2.\n\n            121 // 2 = 60 remainder 1\n            60 //2 = 30 r0\n            30//2=15 r0\n            15//2=7 r1\n            7//2=3 r1\n            3//2=1 r1\n            1//2=0 r1\n\n            So the remainders are [1,0,0,1,1,1,1] and reversed: 1111001 -> which is the same as the input. But note: the input was base2 and the output is base2. However, the problem says to omit leading zeros, but here there are none.\n\n        So the code:\n\n          Read first line: split into tokens, the first token is a (integer), the second token is either integer or 'R'\n\n          Read second line: the string c.\n\n          Step 1: Convert string c from base a to base10 integer.\n\n          Step 2: If the second token is an integer (convert it to int) and between 2 and 25, then convert the base10 integer to base b (that integer).\n\n          Step 3: Else (it's 'R'), convert the base10 integer to a Roman numeral.\n\n        One more edge: if the base10 integer is 0, then for non-Roman we output \"0\", and for Roman we don't have 0 (but the problem says for Roman the number is not zero, so we don't have to handle 0 in Roman).\n\n        However, the input says for Roman: the number is not zero and <= 300010.\n\n        But note: the input string for base a might be \"0\", then base10 integer is 0. Then if b is 'R', we are guaranteed that the number is not zero, so we don't get \"0\" in Roman case.\n\n        But wait: the problem says \"if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0\". So if the input has b='R', then the base10 integer is not zero. However, the input string might be \"0\" in base a, then base10 integer is 0. But the problem also says: \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be ...\". So the input string in base a for the Roman case is guaranteed to yield a number that is not zero and <= 300010. Therefore, we don't have to handle the case of 0 in the Roman branch.\n\n        But note: what if the input string is \"0\" and b is not 'R'? Then we output \"0\". The problem says non-negative integer, so 0 is allowed in non-Roman cases.\n\n        So we must handle 0 for non-Roman.\n\n        Steps for base a to base10:\n\n            n = 0\n            for char in c:\n                # Map char to digit value\n                if char in '0123456789':\n                    d = int(char)\n                else:\n                    d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n\n                # But wait: if the base a is 11, then the digit 'A' is 10, which is < 11, so valid.\n                # However, if the base is 10, then 'A' is invalid. But the input string is valid.\n\n                # But the problem: the input string is in base a, so every digit must be < a.\n\n                # So if d >= a, then it's invalid, but the problem says the input is valid.\n\n                n = n * a + d\n\n            However, note: the string might have leading zeros. The above algorithm naturally handles that because we start with 0 and then add the digits.\n\n        But wait: the above algorithm is standard for base conversion.\n\n        However, the problem says the base a is at least 2 and the string is non-negative.\n\n        But there's a catch: the base a might be greater than 10, and the string might have letters. We have to map the letters correctly.\n\n        But the above mapping for letters doesn't check the base. We assumed that if it's a letter, then it's from 'A' onward. But if base a is 11, then we use 'A' for 10. But if base a is 15, then we can have digits up to 'E' (which is 14). However, the mapping above for letters:\n\n            d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n\n        This gives for 'A' -> 10, which is valid for base>=11. But if base a is 15, then we can also have digits 'B','C','D','E'. But wait, the above mapping for letters doesn't account for the fact that base a might be 15 and then we can have up to 'E' (14). However, the mapping above for letters is independent of base a? That's a problem.\n\n        Actually, we must map a character only if it is a valid digit for base a.\n\n        Revised plan for converting base-a string to base10:\n\n            n = 0\n            for char in c:\n                # Determine the value of the char in base a\n                if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                    d = int(char)\n                else:\n                    # It's a letter\n                    d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n\n                # But if d >= a, then this digit is invalid for base a. However, the problem says the input is valid, so we assume d < a.\n                if d >= a:\n                    # This should not occur, but let's not crash. According to the problem, the input is valid, so we skip?\n                    # Actually, we can break or just ignore? But the problem says valid input, so we assume d < a.\n                    pass\n\n                n = n * a + d\n\n            But wait, what if the base a is 10 and the string contains a letter? Then the letter is invalid. The problem says the input is valid, so we assume that if base a <=10, the string only contains digits.\n\n        Alternatively, we can map the character to a value and then check if that value is less than a. But the problem says the input is valid, so we don't need to check, but let's do it for safety.\n\n        However, the problem says the input is valid, so we can skip the check. But for clarity, we can do:\n\n            n = 0\n            for char in c:\n                if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                    d = int(char)\n                elif 'A' <= char <= 'Z':\n                    d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n                else:\n                    # The problem says valid input, so we assume this doesn't happen.\n                    d = 0   # or raise error? But the problem says valid input.\n\n                if d >= a:\n                    # According to the problem, this should not happen, but if it does, we treat as invalid digit? Or skip?\n                    # But the problem says valid input, so we assume d < a.\n                    # Let's just continue, but note: if d>=a, then the digit is invalid. We are not told to handle invalid input.\n                    # Since the problem guarantees valid input, we don't need to worry.\n                    pass\n\n                n = n * a + d\n\n        But wait: what if the base a is 11 and the string contains a letter 'K'? Then d = ord('K')-ord('A')+10 = 110, which is >=11, so we skip. But the input is valid, so we assume that the letter is only from 'A' to the one that is a-1.\n\n        Actually, the input string is given in base a, so the digits must be in the set {0,1,...,a-1}. Therefore, the letter part must be from 'A' to the letter representing a-1. \n\n        So we can change the mapping: we know the base a, so we can map the letter to a digit only if the digit value is less than a.\n\n        But the problem says valid input, so we can simply use:\n\n            if char in '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' and the digit value < a.\n\n        However, the input might contain digits beyond the base? The problem says valid input, so we assume the digits are valid.\n\n        But note: the problem says the base a is between 2 and 25, so the maximum digit value is 24. The letters go from 'A' (10) to 'O' (24). \n\n        We can do:\n\n            if char in '0123456789':\n                d = int(char)\n            elif 'A' <= char <= chr(ord('A')+a-11):\n                d = ord(char)-ord('A')+10\n            else:\n                # This digit is not allowed in base a, but the problem says valid input, so we don't expect this.\n                d = 0   # but then we have to hope it doesn't happen.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a more general approach: map each character to a digit value and then if the digit value >= a, then it's invalid. But the problem says valid input, so we don't need to handle.\n\n        Since the problem says the input is valid, we can do without the check, but to be safe, we'll do:\n\n            n = 0\n            for char in c:\n                if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                    d = int(char)\n                else:\n                    d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n\n                # Since the input is valid, d must be < a. But if not, we can break or use 0? \n                # But the problem says valid input, so we assume d < a.\n\n                n = n * a + d\n\n        However, if the base a is 10 and the string contains a letter, then d (from letter) is 10 or more, which is invalid. But the problem says valid input, so we assume that if base a is 10, the string does not contain letters.\n\n        But wait: the problem says the input is a non-negative integer in base a, so the digits must be in [0, a-1]. Therefore, if the base is 10, then the digits are 0-9, so no letters.\n\n        So the above mapping is acceptable.\n\n        However, what if the base a is 16 and the string contains a letter 'G'? Then d = ord('G')-ord('A')+10 = 16, which is >=16 -> invalid. But the problem says valid input, so we assume that the letters are only from 'A' to 'F' (for base16). But wait, base a is given as 16, so the maximum digit is 15, so the letters should be from 'A' to 'F'. \n\n        Therefore, the mapping for letters must be restricted to the first (a-10) letters. But the problem says the input is valid, so we don't need to check.\n\n        But note: the problem says the base a is at least 2 and at most 25, and the string is in base a. So the digits in the string must be from 0 to a-1.\n\n        However, if we use the above mapping without checking, then for base a=11, the letter 'A' is 10, which is <11 -> valid. For base a=10, we don't use letters, so we don't see any.\n\n        But wait: what if the base a is 10 and the string contains a letter? Then we map the letter to a value (say 10) and then use it, which is wrong because base10 should not have letters.\n\n        So we must adjust: the mapping for letters is only allowed if the base a is greater than 10. And even then, the letter must not exceed the base.\n\n        Therefore, we must map the character to a digit value, but only if the digit value is less than a. Otherwise, we cannot use that digit.\n\n        However, the problem says the input is valid, so we can assume that the digits are valid. But the mapping we did for letters doesn't depend on the base. We can change the mapping for letters to:\n\n            if char is a letter and (ord(char)-ord('A')+10) < a:\n                d = ord(char)-ord('A')+10\n            else:\n                # Then treat it as a digit? Or error?\n                # But the problem says valid input, so we assume that if the char is a letter, then the base a is greater than 10 and the letter value is less than a.\n                # Actually, we can simply use the same mapping as for digits and hope the input is valid.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a different approach: precompute the maximum digit in base a and then map the string.\n\n        Since the problem says valid input, we can do:\n\n            n = 0\n            for char in c:\n                if char in '0123456789':\n                    d = int(char)\n                else:\n                    d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n\n                # Now, if d >= a, then we have an invalid digit. But the problem says valid input, so we assume d < a.\n\n                n = n * a + d\n\n        And hope that the input is valid.\n\n        But wait: if base a is 11, then the letter 'A' (d=10) is <11 -> valid. If base a is 10, then the string should not contain letters, so if it does, then d (from letter) is >=10, which is >=a (which is 10) -> invalid. But the problem says valid input, so we don't have to worry.\n\n        However, the problem says",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, which could either be a standard base or the Roman numeral system. The solution involves three main steps: converting the input string from its given base to a base-10 integer, then converting this integer to the desired output base (either a standard base or Roman numerals).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Base Conversion from Input Base to Base-10**: The input string is first converted from its original base (a) to a base-10 integer. This involves processing each character of the string, mapping it to its corresponding digit value, and accumulating the total value by considering each digit's positional value.\n2. **Conversion to Output Base**:\n   - **Standard Base**: If the target base (b) is a standard base (integer), the base-10 integer is converted by repeatedly dividing by the base and collecting remainders. These remainders are then mapped back to their respective digits in the target base.\n   - **Roman Numerals**: If the target base is 'R', the base-10 integer is converted to Roman numerals using a predefined mapping of values to Roman symbols. The conversion involves breaking down the integer into the largest possible Roman numeral components and appending the corresponding symbols.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    a_str = first_line[0]\n    base_a = int(a_str)\n    \n    second_token = first_line[1]\n    base_b_str = second_token\n\n    num_str = data[1].strip()\n\n    n = 0\n    for char in num_str:\n        if '0' <= char <= '9':\n            d = int(char)\n        else:\n            d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n        \n        if d >= base_a:\n            continue\n            \n        n = n * base_a + d\n\n    if base_b_str == 'R':\n        if n == 0:\n            print(\"\")\n        else:\n            roman_numerals = [\n                ('M', 1000),\n                ('CM', 900), ('D', 500), ('CD', 400),\n                ('C', 100), ('XC', 90), ('L', 50), ('XL', 40),\n                ('X', 10), ('IX', 9), ('V', 5), ('IV', 4), ('I', 1)\n            ]\n            res = \"\"\n            for numeral, value in roman_numerals:\n                count = n // value\n                res += numeral * count\n                n -= count * value\n            print(res)\n    else:\n        base_b = int(base_b_str)\n        if n == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n        else:\n            digits = []\n            num_val = n\n            while num_val:\n                r = num_val % base_b\n                num_val = num_val // base_b\n                digits.append(r)\n            \n            digits.reverse()\n            digit_map = [str(i) for i in range(10)] + [chr(ord('A') + i - 10) for i in range(10, base_b)]\n            res = ''.join(digit_map[d] for d in digits)\n            print(res)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line contains the original base (a) and the target base (b, which can be 'R' for Roman numerals). The second line contains the number in the original base.\n2. **Base Conversion to Base-10**: The input string is processed character by character. Each character is converted to its digit value (0-9 or A-Z), ensuring it is valid for the original base. The total value is computed by accumulating each digit's contribution based on its position.\n3. **Output Conversion**:\n   - **Roman Numerals**: The base-10 integer is converted to Roman numerals by iteratively subtracting the largest possible Roman numeral values from the integer and appending the corresponding symbols to the result.\n   - **Standard Base**: The base-10 integer is converted to the target base by repeatedly dividing by the base and collecting remainders. These remainders are then mapped to their respective digits (0-9 or A-Z) in the target base to form the result string.\n   \nThis approach efficiently handles both standard base conversions and Roman numeral conversions, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
