He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeros is determined by the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of n!.\n\n The function for the number of trailing zeros in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n Now, we are asked: for a given m (number of trailing zeros), how many positive integers n have Z(n) = m?\n\n But note: the problem says \"exactly m zeroes\". However, observe that Z(n) is non-decreasing. For example, \n   Z(0)=0, Z(1)=0, ... Z(4)=0, Z(5)=1, Z(6)=1, ... Z(9)=1, Z(10)=2, etc.\n\n However, note that sometimes Z(n) jumps by more than one? Actually, no, because when n increases, the exponent only increases at multiples of 5. But note: sometimes the jump can be more than one (e.g., at n=25, we add two 5's). So the same m might not appear for consecutive n.\n\n Actually, we are to find all n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n But note: the problem says \"exactly m zeroes\", and we know that Z(n) is non-decreasing. Also, Z(n) increases only at multiples of 5, and then it may increase by more than one if the number is divisible by higher powers (like 5^2, 5^3, etc.). \n\n However, observe that the function Z(n) is non-decreasing and has plateaus. For example, for m=1, the numbers n from 5 to 9 all have exactly 1 trailing zero. Then at n=10, we get 2 trailing zeros.\n\n Therefore, the answer is: for a given m, we need to find all n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We can first find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m (call it low) and the smallest n such that Z(n) > m (call it high). Then the numbers n for which Z(n)=m are the numbers from low to high-1.\n\n 2. But wait, how do we find the smallest n with Z(n) >= m? This is the typical step for binary search on factorial zeros.\n\n However, note: the problem also requires to output the number of such n (which is high - low) and then the list of these n.\n\n But note: the problem says \"positive integers n\", so n starts from 1.\n\n Example: m=1 -> n from 5 to 9 -> 5 numbers.\n\n However, what if m is very large? We must design an efficient way.\n\n We can use binary search to find:\n\n   Let f(x) = Z(x) = floor(x/5) + floor(x/25) + floor(x/125) + ...\n\n   We want to find the smallest x such that Z(x) >= m. Let this be L.\n\n   Then the next value where Z(x) becomes m+1 or more is the smallest x such that Z(x) >= m+1? Actually, we want the smallest x such that Z(x) > m, which is the same as the smallest x such that Z(x) >= m+1? Not necessarily: because Z(x) can jump from m to m+k (k>=1). But note: we want exactly m, so we want all x such that Z(x)=m.\n\n   Actually, we can define:\n\n      Let L = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n      Let R = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1.\n\n   Then the numbers n with Z(n)=m are from L to R-1.\n\n   Then the count is (R - L).\n\n   However, note: what if there is no n such that Z(n)=m? Then we would get L being the first n that gives at least m, but then R is the first n that gives at least m+1, and if the jump was more than 1, then we have n from L to R-1, and the zeros at L are m, and then at R we get at least m+1. But note: we require exactly m. So if at L we get m, then we have to check if there exists a gap? Actually, the zeros function is non-decreasing and only increases at multiples of 5. But the jump size is determined by the power of 5.\n\n   However, note: we cannot have two different m values without having the intermediate",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of \\( n \\) values that meet the given condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the exponent of 10 in its prime factorization, which is the product of the exponents of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is governed by the exponent of 5 in \\( n! \\). This count can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until the division yields zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: Given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\) (lower bound) and the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\) (upper bound). The valid \\( n \\) values lie between these two bounds. The difference between these bounds gives the count of numbers \\( n \\) satisfying \\( Z(n) = m \\).\n\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: If no \\( n \\) exists such that \\( Z(n) = m \\), the output should reflect this by printing 0 followed by a blank line.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while n >= divisor:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(input().strip())\n    \n    def find_lower_bound(target):\n        low, high = 0, 10**18\n        while low < high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            zeros = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n            if zeros < target:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid\n        return low\n\n    low_bound = find_lower_bound(m)\n    zeros_at_low = count_trailing_zeros(low_bound)\n    \n    if zeros_at_low != m:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    upper_bound = find_lower_bound(m + 1)\n    \n    count = upper_bound - low_bound\n    if count == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        print(count)\n        if count <= 10:\n            numbers = list(range(low_bound, upper_bound))\n            print(\" \".join(map(str, numbers)))\n        else:\n            print()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeros(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the division result is zero.\n\n2. **find_lower_bound(target)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq \\text{target} \\). The search space is set from 0 to a sufficiently large number (10^18) to handle all possible values of \\( m \\) up to 100,000.\n\n3. **Main Logic**: The main function reads the input \\( m \\), computes the lower and upper bounds using `find_lower_bound`, and checks if the lower bound indeed has exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. If not, it outputs 0. Otherwise, it calculates the count of numbers between the lower and upper bounds and prints them in increasing order if the count is small (≤10); otherwise, it just prints the count.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the range of valid \\( n \\) values using binary search, leveraging the non-decreasing nature of the trailing zero count function \\( Z(n) \\). The solution handles edge cases where no valid \\( n \\) exists or the range is too large to list individually.",
