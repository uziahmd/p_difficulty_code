Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering the gaps between lanterns and the ends.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the list of lantern positions.\n 2. The entire street must be covered from 0 to l.\n 3. Consider two parts: \n    a) The left end (from 0 to the first lantern)\n    b) The gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n    c) The right end (from the last lantern to l)\n\n 4. For the left end: we need to cover from 0 to the first lantern at position a0.\n    The required d for the left end is at least a0 / 2.0.\n\n 5. For the gaps between two consecutive lanterns (say, between a[i] and a[i+1]):\n    The gap is (a[i+1] - a[i]). To cover this gap, the two lanterns must have their light overlap or meet.\n    The required d for this gap is (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.0.\n\n 6. For the right end: we need to cover from the last lantern (at position a[-1]) to l.\n    The required d for the right end is (l - a[-1]) / 2.0.\n\n 7. However, note that the lanterns can cover beyond their own positions. We are to find the minimum d such that the entire street is lit.\n\n 8. Actually, we can think of the entire street being covered if the maximum of the following is sufficient:\n    - The left gap requires d >= (a[0] - 0)/2\n    - The middle gaps require d >= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2 for each i\n    - The right gap requires d >= (l - a[-1])/2\n\n 9. But note: the lanterns are placed arbitrarily. The idea is that the light from one lantern might extend to the next, so we don't necessarily need half the gap in the middle? Actually, we can use the following:\n\n    We can consider the coverage from the leftmost lantern to the rightmost. We want to know the minimal d such that the entire street is covered.\n\n    Alternatively, we can do:\n\n    - Let d_left = a[0] / 2.0   [if we only have the first lantern, then to cover from 0 to a[0], d must be at least a[0]/2]\n    - Then for each gap from i=0 to n-2, the next lantern must be within d of the previous, so the gap (a[i+1]-a[i]) must be <= 2*d. But note: the coverage from the left lantern extends to a[i] + d, and the next lantern starts at a[i+1]. So the condition is that a[i+1] - (a[i] + d) <= d? Actually, the two lights must meet or overlap: so we require that the gap (a[i+1] - a[i]) is covered by the two d's: meaning that from a[i] we go d to the right, and from a[i+1] we go d to the left. Therefore, we require d >= (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.\n\n    Similarly, for the left end: we require that the first lantern's light reaches from 0 to at least a[0] (so d >= a[0]).\n    But wait, actually the first lantern must cover from 0 to a[0]+d. So we require that a[0] + d >= 0 (which is always true) and the coverage must start at 0, so the leftmost point 0 must be within d of a[0]: that is, a[0] <= d? Actually, no: the distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0]. The condition is that a[0] - d <= 0? Actually, we require that the light from the first lantern covers 0, so 0 must be >= a[0] - d and <= a[0] + d. Since 0 is to the left of a[0], the condition is a[0] - d <= 0 -> d >= a[0].\n\n    However, wait: the example input \"2 5\\n2 5\" gives output 2.0. Here, the first lantern at 2: to cover 0, we need 2 - d <= 0 -> d>=2. The second lantern at 5: to cover the right end (5) and beyond? The street ends at 5, so we require the second lantern to cover up to 5. The condition for the second lantern to cover 5 is that 5 <= 5 + d (always true) and 5 - d <= 5 (always true). But also, we",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` required for all lanterns to illuminate the entire street from point `0` to point `l`. The solution involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the ends of the street.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: The first step is to sort the positions of the lanterns in ascending order. This helps in systematically checking the coverage between consecutive lanterns and the street ends.\n2. **Check Left End Coverage**: The leftmost point of the street is `0`. The first lantern must cover this point, so the required `d` must be at least the distance from the first lantern to `0` (i.e., `a[0] / 2`).\n3. **Check Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the gap between them must be covered by their combined light. The required `d` for each gap is half the distance between the two lanterns (i.e., `(a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2`).\n4. **Check Right End Coverage**: The rightmost point of the street is `l`. The last lantern must cover this point, so the required `d` must be at least the distance from the last lantern to `l` (i.e., `(l - a[-1]) / 2`).\n5. **Determine Minimum `d`**: The overall minimum `d` is the maximum value among the individual requirements derived from the left end, gaps between lanterns, and the right end.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = float(data[1])\n    a = list(map(float, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        d = max(a[0], l - a[0]) / 2.0\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(d))\n        return\n        \n    gaps = []\n    gaps.append(a[0] / 2.0)\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap_needed = (a[i] - a[i-1]) / 2.0\n        gaps.append(gap_needed)\n    gaps.append((l - a[-1]) / 2.0)\n    \n    d_required = max(gaps)\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(d_required))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed into the number of lanterns `n`, the street length `l`, and the list of lantern positions `a`.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to process them in order from left to right.\n3. **Single Lantern Case**: If there's only one lantern, the required `d` is the maximum of the distances from the lantern to the start (`0`) and end (`l`) of the street, divided by 2.\n4. **Gap Calculation**: For multiple lanterns, the gaps considered include:\n   - The distance from the start of the street to the first lantern.\n   - The distances between consecutive lanterns.\n   - The distance from the last lantern to the end of the street.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The minimum `d` needed to cover all gaps is the maximum value among these calculated gaps, printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that the entire street is illuminated by leveraging sorted positions and systematic gap analysis, providing the optimal solution with minimal computational overhead.",
