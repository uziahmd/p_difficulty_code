Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, and then n lines of n characters each.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. All the letters on both diagonals must be the same (but note: the center is part of both diagonals, so we can consider the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal).\n 2. All the other squares (not on either diagonal) must contain the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letter.\n\n However, note that the example input:\n   5\n   xooox\n   oxoxo\n   soxoo\n   oxoxo\n   xooox\n\n This should output \"NO\", because the center is 's' (from the third line: 'soxoo') but the diagonals should have the same letter? \n Actually, let's break down:\n\n Condition 1: Both diagonals must have the same letter. In the example, the main diagonal has 'x','o','s','o','x' -> not the same.\n Condition 2: The non-diagonal letters must be the same and different from the diagonal.\n\n But wait, the example also shows:\n   Input: 3\n           wsw\n           sws\n           wsw   -> Output: YES\n\n Let's check the condition for a 3x3:\n   Main diagonal: (0,0)='w', (1,1)='s', (2,2)='w' -> all same? Actually no, unless we require that they are the same? \n   But wait, in the example, the center is 's'. The diagonals are supposed to be the same? But here the main diagonal has ['w','s','w'] which are not all the same.\n\n However, reading the problem statement again: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\".\n\n But in the example, the main diagonal has two 'w's and one 's'? So condition fails? Then why is the answer \"YES\"?\n\n Let me re-read: \n   \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n In the example, the main diagonal: \n   row0: index0 -> 'w'\n   row1: index1 -> 's'\n   row2: index2 -> 'w'\n\n They are not the same. Similarly, the anti-diagonal:\n   row0: index2 -> 'w'\n   row1: index1 -> 's'\n   row2: index0 -> 'w'\n\n So both diagonals are not entirely the same? Then how is it \"YES\"?\n\n But wait, the example input is:\n\n     3\n     wsw\n     sws\n     wsw\n\n The example output is \"YES\".\n\n This implies that the condition is not that the entire diagonal is the same, but that there is one particular letter for the entire diagonal? \n\n Actually, wait: the example input provided in the problem is:\n\n     Input: \n        ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n     Output: \n        ['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\n Let's check the second example: \n     n=3, grid:\n        w s w\n        s w s\n        w s w\n\n Wait, the example input says: \n        \"3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\"\n\n So the grid is:\n        row0: 'w','s','w'\n        row1: 's','w','s'\n        row2: 'w','s','w'\n\n Now, the main diagonal: [grid[0][0], grid[1][1], grid[2][2]] = ['w','w','w'] -> same.\n The anti-diagonal: [grid[0][2], grid[1][1], grid[2][0]] = ['w','w','w'] -> same.\n\n And the non-diagonal positions: \n        (0,1): 's', (0,2) is on anti-diagonal so skip? Actually, we must consider all positions that are not on the main diagonal or anti-diagonal.\n\n How to define the diagonals?\n   Main diagonal: i == j\n   Anti-diagonal: i+j == n-1\n\n In the example, the non-diagonal positions are:\n        (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)\n\n And these are all 's'. And the diagonal letter is 'w'.\n\n So conditions hold.\n\n But wait, the example input was written as:\n\n        \"3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\"\n\n This is actually:\n        Line0: \"wsw\" -> ['w','s','w']\n        Line1: \"sws\" -> ['s','w','s']\n        Line2: \"wsw\" -> ['w','s','w']\n\n Therefore, the main diagonal is [w, w, w] (because (0,0)='w', (1,1)='w', (2,2)='w')? \n        But wait, (1,1) is 'w'? Then yes.\n\n However, the example provided in the problem's first sample is:\n\n        Input: \n          5\n          xooox\n          oxoxo\n          soxoo\n          oxoxo\n          xooox\n\n        Expected: NO\n\n Why?\n\n Let's break down the 5x5 example:\n\n        n=5, grid:\n          row0: 'x','o','o','o','x'\n          row1: 'o','x','o','x','o'\n          row2: 's','o','x','o','s'   # Wait, the example input says the third line is 'soxoo' -> but wait, the example input is given as string: 'soxoo'\n          row3: 'o','x','o','x','o'\n          row4: 'x','o','o','o','x'\n\n Conditions:\n   Diagonals must be same letter.\n\n   Main diagonal: \n        (0,0)='x'\n        (1,1)='x'\n        (2,2)='x'\n        (3,3)='x'\n        (4,4)='x'\n\n   Anti-diagonal:\n        (0,4)='x'\n        (1,3)='x'\n        (2,2)='x'\n        (3,1)='x'\n        (4,0)='x'\n\n   So the diagonals are all 'x'. \n\n   Now, the other squares: we need to check that every non-diagonal square is the same letter and different from 'x'.\n\n   Let's check the non-diagonal squares:\n\n        row0: \n            (0,1): 'o', (0,2): 'o', (0,3): 'o' -> okay, but wait, (0,0) and (0,4) are on diagonals, so (0,1) to (0,3) are non-diagonal.\n        row1:\n            (1,0): 'o', (1,2): 'o', (1,4): 'o' -> okay\n        row2:\n            (2,0): 's', (2,1): 'o', (2,3): 'o', (2,4): 'o' -> here we see 's' at (2,0) and (2,4) is diagonal? \n            Actually, (2,0): i+j = 2+0 = 2, which is not 4 (n-1=4) and i != j -> so non-diagonal. \n            Similarly, (2,4): i+j=6, which is not 4, but wait, (2,4) is not on main diagonal (i==j -> 2==4? no) and anti-diagonal (i+j=2+4=6 !=4)? \n\n        Correction: the anti-diagonal condition is i+j == n-1. For n=5, n-1=4. So (2,4): 2+4=6 !=4 -> non-diagonal.\n\n        So (2,0) is non-diagonal and it's 's'. But (0,1) is 'o'. So the non-diagonal letter must be the same, but we have both 'o' and 's'. \n\n        Therefore, condition 2 fails.\n\n   However, wait: the example input provided for the first sample is:\n\n          \"5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox\"\n\n   Let me write the grid explicitly:\n\n        row0: ['x','o','o','o','x']\n        row1: ['o','x','o','x','o']\n        row2: ['s','o','x','o','s']   # Note: the third line is 'soxoo' -> so the last two are 'o' and 'o', but wait, the example says \"soxoo\", meaning the fifth character is 'o' (since 0-indexed: positions 0 to 4). \n        row3: ['o','x','o','x','o']\n        row4: ['x','o','o','o','x']\n\n   Now, the non-diagonal positions in row2: \n        (2,0): 's' -> non-diagonal, and (2,1): 'o', (2,3): 'o', (2,4): 's' (wait, the third line is \"soxoo\", so the last two are 'o' and 'o'? Actually, the third line has 5 characters: \n            s o x o o -> so (2,4) is 'o', not 's').\n\n   Correction: the third line is \"soxoo\", so the fifth character (index4) is 'o'. So (2,4) is 'o'.\n\n   Then the non-diagonal letters in row2: \n        (2,0): 's', (2,1): 'o', (2,3): 'o', (2,4): 'o'\n\n   Now, we have two different letters: 's' and 'o'. \n\n   Therefore, the non-diagonal squares are not all the same letter.\n\n   So the condition fails.\n\n   But wait, the example output is \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n   However, the example input \"3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\" gives:\n\n        Grid:\n          row0: ['w','s','w']\n          row1: ['s','w','s']\n          row2: ['w','s','w']\n\n   Non-diagonal squares: \n        (0,1): 's'\n        (1,0): 's', (1,2): 's'\n        (2,1): 's'\n\n   So all non-diagonal squares are 's'. And the diagonal squares are 'w'. So condition holds.\n\n   Now, the third example:\n\n        Input: \n          3\n          xpx\n          pxp\n          xpe\n\n        Expected: \"NO\"\n\n        Let's check:\n\n        Grid:\n          row0: ['x','p','x']\n          row1: ['p','x','p']\n          row2: ['x','p','e']\n\n        Diagonals:\n          Main: (0,0)='x', (1,1)='x', (2,2)='e' -> not same (x vs e). So condition 1 fails.\n\n        Also, even if we didn't notice, condition 2: non-diagonal squares must be same and different from diagonal. But condition 1 fails so overall NO.\n\n Approach:\n\n Step 1: Read n and the grid.\n\n Step 2: Check the diagonals.\n\n   Let d1 = set of letters on the main diagonal (where i == j)\n   Let d2 = set of letters on the anti-diagonal (where i+j == n-1)\n\n   Condition 1: The diagonals must have the same letter? Actually, the problem states: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\".\n\n   This means that the main diagonal must have one letter (say 'a') and the anti-diagonal must have one letter (say 'b'). But note: the center is common to both, so if the center is included, then the entire diagonal must be the same, including the center.\n\n   However, the example \"3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\" has the center being 'w' (for main) and the center is also part of anti-diagonal, and the anti-diagonal is also 'w'. So the diagonals must be the same letter? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"all letters are the same\" for each diagonal. It doesn't say the two diagonals must be the same letter. But wait, read the problem again: \n\n      \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;\"\n\n   This means that on the main diagonal, all letters are the same (say 'a'), and on the anti-diagonal, all letters are the same (say 'b'). \n\n   However, the example 3x3 has the center being part of both, so if the main diagonal is all 'a' and the anti-diagonal is all 'b', then the center must be both 'a' and 'b'. Therefore, we must have a = b.\n\n   So the entire main diagonal is the same letter, say 'a'; the entire anti-diagonal is the same letter, say 'a' (because they share the center). \n\n   Therefore, condition 1: the main diagonal must have one letter, the anti-diagonal must have the same letter (because they meet at the center).\n\n   But wait, what if the grid is:\n\n        a b a\n        b c b\n        a b a\n\n   Then the main diagonal is [a, c, a] -> not same, unless c=a. Similarly, anti-diagonal is [a, c, a] -> not same unless c=a.\n\n   So actually, the diagonals must be the same letter throughout.\n\n   Therefore, we can:\n\n        Let diag_letter = grid[i][i] for the main diagonal. Then check that for every i, grid[i][i] is that letter.\n\n        Similarly, for the anti-diagonal: for every i, grid[i][n-1-i] is the same letter.\n\n        But note: the center is included in both, so the entire main diagonal and anti-diagonal must be the same letter (say 'a').\n\n Step 3: Check the non-diagonal squares.\n\n        Let other_letter = a letter that is not 'a' (the diagonal letter) and must appear in every non-diagonal square.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        - Traverse through the grid. For each cell (i, j):\n            if (i == j) or (i+j == n-1): then we are on a diagonal, so skip.\n            else: \n                if we haven't found the candidate letter, we can take the first non-diagonal letter we find and call it 'b'.\n                then, for every non-diagonal cell, check that the letter is 'b'.\n\n        But note: what if the grid has no non-diagonal cells? Only when n=1, but n>=3.\n\n        However, we must also ensure that the non-diagonal letter is different from 'a'. \n\n Step 4: If both conditions hold, print \"YES\". Otherwise, \"NO\".\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Condition 1: \n        Let a = None\n        For i in range(n):\n            if i==0: a = grid[i][i]\n            else: \n                if grid[i][i] != a: then condition1 fails.\n\n        Similarly for anti-diagonal:\n            For i in range(n):\n                if i==0: a2 = grid[i][n-1-i]\n                else: \n                    if grid[i][n-1-i] != a2: then condition1 fails.\n\n        But note: the center is the same for both, so we can check the entire main diagonal and entire anti-diagonal and require that the entire grid's diagonals are the same. However, we must also ensure that the two diagonals are the same letter? \n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            Let a = grid[0][0]   (this is the main diagonal's first element)\n            Then check main diagonal: for i in range(n): if grid[i][i] != a -> fail.\n\n            Then check anti-diagonal: \n                Let b = grid[0][n-1]   (first element of anti-diagonal)\n                Then for i in range(n): if grid[i][n-1-i] != b -> fail.\n\n            But wait, the center: grid[n//2][n//2] must be equal to both a and b? \n\n            Actually, the center is (n//2, n//2). In the main diagonal: grid[n//2][n//2] must be a. In the anti-diagonal: grid[n//2][n//2] must be b. So we require a==b.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Check the entire main diagonal and anti-diagonal and then check that the center (if we did separately) is consistent, but actually the two diagonals must be the same letter because the center is common.\n\n        So we can combine:\n\n            Condition1: \n                Let a = grid[0][0]\n                Check main diagonal: for i in range(n): if grid[i][i] != a -> NO.\n\n                Then, let b = grid[0][n-1]\n                Check anti-diagonal: for i in range(n): if grid[i][n-1-i] != b -> NO.\n\n                Then, if a != b -> NO.\n\n        But wait, what if the main diagonal is all 'a' and the anti-diagonal is all 'b' and a != b? Then the center (which is in both) must be both 'a' and 'b', which is impossible unless a==b.\n\n        Therefore, we can simply check the entire diagonals and then check the center? Actually, we can check the entire diagonals and then check that the center is the same for both? \n\n        Alternatively, we can check:\n\n            For the main diagonal, we require all same letter, say A.\n            For the anti-diagonal, we require all same letter, say B.\n            Then we require A == B.\n\n        But note: the center is (n//2, n//2) and it must be in both, so the center must be A and B, hence A==B.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            A = grid[0][0]\n            for i in range(n):\n                if grid[i][i] != A:\n                    flag1 = False\n                    break\n            else:\n                flag1 = True\n\n            B = grid[0][n-1]\n            for i in range(n):\n                if grid[i][n-1-i] != B:\n                    flag1 = False\n                    break\n\n            if flag1 and A == B: \n                # then condition1 holds\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n   Condition 2:\n\n        We know the diagonal letter is A (which is the same for both diagonals).\n\n        Now, we want to check that:\n            Every non-diagonal cell has the same letter, say B, and B != A.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Step 1: Find the candidate B from a non-diagonal cell.\n\n            However, what if there is no non-diagonal cell? Then n>=3, so there are non-diagonal cells.\n\n            We can:\n\n                candidate = None\n                for i in range(n):\n                    for j in range(n):\n                        if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                            continue\n                        else:\n                            if candidate is None:\n                                candidate = grid[i][j]\n                            else:\n                                if grid[i][j] != candidate:\n                                    flag2 = False\n                                    break\n                    if flag2 is already broken, break\n\n                Then, we must also check that candidate != A.\n\n            But wait, what if the grid has a mix of letters in non-diagonal? We break when we find a different one.\n\n            However, we must also consider that the non-diagonal cells might not be present? Actually, n>=3, so there are non-diagonal cells.\n\n            But what if the grid has non-diagonal cells with different letters? Then we break and set flag2 to False.\n\n            Also, we must check that candidate is not A. \n\n        However, there is a catch: what if the grid has no non-diagonal cell? That is, n=1? But n>=3.\n\n        Another catch: what if the grid has non-diagonal cells, but we don't know if they are the same? We traverse until we find the candidate and then compare.\n\n        But note: we must check that every non-diagonal cell is the same and that same letter is not A.\n\n        However, what if the grid has two different non-diagonal letters? Then condition2 fails.\n\n        So:\n\n            candidate = None\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                        continue\n                    if candidate is None:\n                        candidate = grid[i][j]\n                    elif grid[i][j] != candidate:\n                        flag2 = False\n                        break\n                if not flag2:\n                    break\n\n            if candidate is None: \n                # This means there are no non-diagonal cells? But n>=3, so normally there are. But if n==1, but n>=3, so this case shouldn't occur.\n                flag2 = True   # Actually, then we have a grid with only diagonal? Then condition2 is trivially satisfied? But the problem says \"other squares\" (plural) so there must be at least one? \n                # Actually, the problem says: \"all other squares ... (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter\", so if there are no other squares, then condition holds? \n                # But note: n>=3, so the smallest n is 3, which has 9-2*3+2 = 9-6+2? Actually, non-diagonal cells: 9-2*3+2? Actually, the diagonals have 3 cells, and the total is 9, so non-diagonal is 6. \n                # So candidate will never be None for n>=3.\n\n            Then, we must check that candidate != A.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Step 1: Check that the entire grid's non-diagonal cells are the same letter and that letter is not A.\n\n            We can do:\n\n            non_diag_letters = set()\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                        continue\n                    non_diag_letters.add(grid[i][j])\n\n            Then, condition2 holds if:\n                len(non_diag_letters) == 1 and (next(iter(non_diag_letters)) != A\n\n        This is simpler.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"all other squares\" (non-diagonal) must be the same letter and that letter is different from A.\n\n        So:\n\n            if len(non_diag_letters) != 1:\n                flag2 = False\n            else:\n                letter = next(iter(non_diag_letters))\n                if letter == A:\n                    flag2 = False\n                else:\n                    flag2 = True\n\n        However, we must consider: what if the grid has no non-diagonal cells? Then non_diag_letters would be empty set. Then len(non_diag_letters)==0, which is not 1 -> condition fails. But for n>=3, there are non-diagonal cells. \n\n        But wait, the grid must have non-diagonal cells. Since n>=3, the number of non-diagonal cells is n*n - 2*n + 1 (because the two diagonals together have 2*n - 1 cells, but note the center is counted twice, so actually the diagonals have 2*n-1 distinct cells? No, the two diagonals share the center. So the total diagonal cells is 2*n - 1. Then non-diagonal cells: n*n - (2*n-1). For n=3: 9-5=4, which is positive.\n\n        Therefore, we can use the set method.\n\n        However, the set method might be inefficient if the grid is large, but n<300, so maximum 300*300=90000 cells, which is acceptable.\n\n        But note: we are already reading the grid and we can do two passes.\n\n        Alternatively, we can combine the two conditions in one pass, but the set approach is clear.\n\n        However, let's consider performance: we are going to traverse the grid twice (once for diagonals and once for non-diagonals). But the set approach for non-diagonals is one pass.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            Step 1: Check the diagonals (two passes: one for main, one for anti) and get the diagonal letter A.\n\n            Step 2: Traverse the grid to collect non-diagonal letters and check they are all the same and not A.\n\n        But note: we must check that the non-diagonal cells are the same and different from A.\n\n        There is one more issue: what if the diagonal letter A does not appear in the non-diagonal? We are checking that the non-diagonal letter is different from A.\n\n        So the plan:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            grid = []\n            for i in range(n):\n                grid.append(input().strip())\n\n            # Condition 1: Check diagonals and get A.\n            A = grid[0][0]\n            # Check main diagonal\n            for i in range(n):\n                if grid[i][i] != A:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n            # Check anti-diagonal\n            for i in range(n):\n                if grid[i][n-1-i] != A:   # But wait, the anti-diagonal should be the same letter as the main diagonal? \n                    # Actually, we must check that the anti-diagonal is all the same, but we don't know if it is the same as A?\n                    # But note: the center is common. So the anti-diagonal must be A? Because the center is A (from the main diagonal) and the anti-diagonal must be the same letter (condition1: the anti-diagonal must be the same, but we don't know what letter). \n\n                    # However, we broke the condition above that the main diagonal is all A. The anti-diagonal must be the same letter, but that letter might be different from A? \n\n                    # But wait, the center is (n//2, n//2) and we know grid[n//2][n//2] is A (from the main diagonal). So the anti-diagonal must have A at the center. But the entire anti-diagonal must be the same letter, say B. Then B must be A.\n\n                    # Therefore, we can check the anti-diagonal with the same letter A.\n\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n            # But wait, the above loop for anti-diagonal uses the same A from the main diagonal. \n\n            However, what if the main diagonal is all A, and the anti-diagonal is all B, but the center (which is A) is also part of the anti-diagonal, so we require B to be A. \n\n            So we can check the anti-diagonal with the same letter A.\n\n            Alternatively, we can check the anti-diagonal independently and then check that the two diagonals are the same. But since the center is common, we can do:\n\n                Check main diagonal: all A.\n                Check anti-diagonal: all same letter (without necessarily being A) and then check that the anti-diagonal letter is A.\n\n            But note: the center is A, so the anti-diagonal must have A at the center. Therefore, the anti-diagonal's letter must be A.\n\n            So we can simply check the anti-diagonal for A.\n\n            However, what if the anti-diagonal is not A? Then we break.\n\n            But wait, the problem requires that the entire anti-diagonal is the same letter. So we can check:\n\n                Let B = grid[0][n-1]\n                Then check that for every i, grid[i][n-1-i] == B.\n\n                And then we require that B == A (because the center is A and the center is grid[n//2][n//2] = A, so B must be A).\n\n            Actually, we can do:\n\n                Step 1: Check main diagonal: all same letter, say A.\n                Step 2: Check anti-diagonal: all same letter, say B, and also that B == A.\n\n            But note: the center is included in both, so the center must be A and B, hence A==B.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                A = grid[0][0]\n                for i in range(n):\n                    if grid[i][i] != A:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        exit(0)\n\n                # Now, for anti-diagonal: we don't know the letter, so we can take the first element (grid[0][n-1]) and check the entire anti-diagonal is that letter, and then check that the center is A (which we know from main diagonal) and the anti-diagonal must be the same as A.\n\n                B = grid[0][n-1]\n                for i in range(n):\n                    if grid[i][n-1-i] != B:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        exit(0)\n\n                if B != A:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n            Alternatively, we can check the entire anti-diagonal without using A initially, but then compare the two diagonals.\n\n            However, the above code does:\n\n                First, we check main diagonal and get A (from grid[0][0]).\n                Then, we check anti-diagonal: we take the top-right corner (grid[0][n-1]) as B and then check the entire anti-diagonal is B.\n                Then, we check that B equals A.\n\n            But note: the center is (n//2, n//2) and we know from the main diagonal that grid[n//2][n//2] = A, and from the anti-diagonal that grid[n//2][n//2] = B, so A must equal B.\n\n            However, what if the main diagonal is all A, but the anti-diagonal is all B and A != B? Then the center is both A and B, which is impossible. So we must have A==B.\n\n            Therefore, we can check the anti-diagonal independently and then check the center? \n\n            Actually, we don't need to check the center again because the anti-diagonal check includes the center.\n\n            But wait, the anti-diagonal check: we are checking that the entire anti-diagonal is B. The center is included, so grid[n//2][n//2] must be B. And from the main diagonal, it is A. So we require A==B.\n\n            So the above code is correct.\n\n            However, note: the main diagonal starts with grid[0][0] and the anti-diagonal starts with grid[0][n-1]. What if the main diagonal is all A, but the anti-diagonal is all A too? Then B==A.\n\n            Example 3x3: \n                grid[0][0] = 'w', grid[0][2] = 'w' (for anti-diagonal). Then we check the entire anti-diagonal is 'w'. Then condition holds.\n\n            Example 5x5: \n                grid[0][0]='x', grid[0][4]='x'. Then we check the entire anti-diagonal is 'x'. Then condition holds.\n\n            But wait, in the first example of 5x5, the main diagonal is all 'x' and the anti-diagonal is all 'x', so condition1 holds.\n\n            Then we move to condition2.\n\n        Condition2:\n\n            We have to check that every non-diagonal cell is the same letter and that letter is not A.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                non_diag_set = set()\n                for i in range(n):\n                    for j in range(n):\n                        if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                            continue\n                        non_diag_set.add(grid[i][j])\n\n                if len(non_diag_set) == 1:\n                    letter = next(iter(non_diag_set))\n                    if letter != A:\n                        print(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n        However, wait: what if the grid has non-diagonal cells that are the same but that same letter is A? Then condition2 fails because the non-diagonal letter must be different from A.\n\n        Example: \n            n=3, grid:\n                aaa\n                a a\n                aaa\n\n            Then the diagonals are all 'a', and the non-diagonal cells are 'a' (in the middle of the sides). Then condition2 fails because the non-diagonal letter is 'a' which is the same as A.\n\n        Therefore, we must check that the non-diagonal letter is not A.\n\n        So the code:\n\n            if len(non_diag_set) == 1 and list(non_diag_set)[0] != A:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n        But wait, what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Then non_diag_set is empty. Then len(non_diag_set)==0, so condition fails. But for n>=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\n        However, we can also handle the empty set by:\n\n            if not non_diag_set: \n                # Then there are no non-diagonal cells, so condition2: the requirement is that all other squares (there are none) are the same letter and different from A -> vacuously true? \n                # But the problem says: \"all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals\". \n                # Since there are no other squares, the condition holds. However, the letter must be defined? But there are no letters to check. \n\n                # However, the problem does not specify what to do in the absence of other squares. But note: the grid must have at least 3x3, and for n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells. \n\n                # So we don't have to worry.\n\n        But wait, what if n=1? But n>=3.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n            # Condition 1: Check diagonals\n            A = grid[0][0]\n\n            # Check main diagonal\n            for i in range(n):\n                if grid[i][i] != A:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n            B = grid[0][n-1]\n            # Check anti-diagonal\n            for i in range(n):\n                if grid[i][n-1-i] != B:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n            if B != A:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n            # Condition 2: Check non-diagonal cells\n            non_diag_letters = set()\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                        continue\n                    non_diag_letters.add(grid[i][j])\n\n            if len(non_diag_letters) == 1:\n                letter = next(iter(non_diag_letters))\n                if letter != A:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n        But wait, what if the grid has non-diagonal cells with two different letters? Then non_diag_letters has size>=2, so we print \"NO\".\n\n        However, we can optimize: we can break early if we find two different non-diagonal letters.\n\n        But the set method is acceptable for n<300 (max 90000 cells, and set insertion is O(1) average, so worst-case 90000 insertions is acceptable in Python).\n\n        However, we can also do:\n\n            expected_letter = None\n            valid = True\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                        continue\n                    if expected_letter is None:\n                        expected_letter = grid[i][j]\n                    elif grid[i][j] != expected_letter:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                if not valid:\n                    break\n\n            if valid and expected_letter is not None and expected_letter != A:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n        But note: the above breaks early and is more efficient.\n\n        However, we are already doing two separate checks (diagonals and then non-diagonals). \n\n        Let me choose the set method for clarity.\n\n        But note: the problem constraints say n<300, so the grid has at most 300*300=90000 cells, and the set method would store up to 90000 elements in the worst-case (if all non-diagonal are distinct) but that would be a set of 90000, which is acceptable in terms of memory? \n\n        However, worst-case the set could have up to (n*n - (2*n-1)) elements, which for n=300 is about 90000 - 599 = 89401, which is acceptable in terms of time and memory in Python? \n\n        But worst-case, we are storing 89401 characters, which is about 89401 bytes, which is about 90 KB, which is acceptable.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            non_diag_letter = None\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                        continue\n                    if non_diag_letter is None:\n                        non_diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        if grid[i][j] != non_diag_letter:\n                            non_diag_letter = None   # invalidate and break?\n                            break\n                if non_diag_letter",

The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonals**: \n   - **Main Diagonal**: Verify that all elements from the top-left to the bottom-right are the same letter.\n   - **Anti-Diagonal**: Verify that all elements from the top-right to the bottom-left are the same letter.\n   - Additionally, ensure that the letters used in both diagonals are identical since they share the center element.\n\n2. **Check Non-Diagonal Elements**:\n   - All elements not on either diagonal must be the same letter and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Condition 1: Check the diagonals\n    A = grid[0][0]\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][i] != A:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n    B = grid[0][n-1]\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][n-1-i] != B:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n    if B != A:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    # Condition 2: Check non-diagonal elements\n    non_diag_letters = set()\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            non_diag_letters.add(grid[i][j])\n            \n    if len(non_diag_letters) == 1:\n        letter = next(iter(non_diag_letters))\n        if letter != A:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the grid size `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: \n   - The main diagonal is checked by verifying all elements from `(0,0)` to `(n-1, n-1)` are the same letter `A`.\n   - The anti-diagonal is checked similarly, ensuring all elements from `(0, n-1)` to `(n-1, 0)` are the same letter `B`.\n   - If `A` and `B` differ, the grid does not form an \"X\".\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: \n   - Collect all letters not on either diagonal into a set. If the set contains exactly one unique letter and it differs from `A`, the grid forms an \"X\"; otherwise, it does not.\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the conditions for forming an \"X\" by leveraging set operations and early termination upon finding any discrepancy. The solution handles edge cases and ensures correctness for all valid inputs within the constraints.",
