    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting non-degenerate triangles (x, y, z) with integer sides such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\nBut note: the condition is A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D.\n\nFor a triangle (x, y, z) to be non-degenerate, the triangle inequality must hold:\n   x + y > z\n   x + z > y\n   y + z > x\n\nHowever, given the constraints on x, y, z (x <= y <= z), the most restrictive condition is the first one (x+y>z). \nThe other two will automatically hold because:\n   Since x <= y <= z, then x+z >= x+y > z >= y? Actually, let's check:\n\nCondition 2: x+z > y. Since x <= y and z>=y, then x+z >= y + y = 2y >= y + x (but we know x<=y, so actually 2y might be more than x+y? \nBut note: we know x<=y<=z, so x+z >= y+z >= y+y = 2y. But we also have y>=x, so 2y >= x+y? Only if y>=x, which is true. However, note that x+z >= 2y, but we require x+z>y. Since 2y>y, it holds.\n\nSimilarly, condition 3: y+z > x. Since y>=x and z>=y>=x, then y+z >= x+x = 2x, which is greater than x (unless x=0, but our numbers are at least 1). So indeed, the only condition we need to enforce is x+y>z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n   Count the number of triples (x,y,z) with \n        x in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D] \n   such that x+y>z.\n\nWe can think of iterating over x and y, and then for each (x,y) count the number of z in [C, D] such that z < x+y.\n\nBut note: the ranges can be up to 500,000, so we cannot iterate over x from A to B (which could be 500,000) and y from B to C (which could be 500,000) because that would be O(n^2) which is 25e10, too slow.\n\nWe need a smarter way.\n\nLet me reframe:\n\nWe want to count:\n   Sum_{x=A}^{B} Sum_{y=B}^{C} [number of z in [C, D] such that z < x+y]\n\nBut note: the condition on z is independent of x and y except for the sum x+y. So we can precompute the counts for z.\n\nAlternatively, we can fix the value of s = x+y, and then for each s, we know that z must be in [max(C, s+1), D] (actually, z < s, so the condition is z <= s-1, but note: z must be at least C and at most D). However, we have to be cautious because x+y can vary.\n\nBut note: the minimum value for s is A+B (since x>=A, y>=B) and maximum value is B+C (since x<=B, y<=C). \n\nNow, the total number of z for a fixed s is:\n   If s-1 < C, then no z.\n   Else, the number of z is max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1) but note: we require z<=min(D, s-1) and z>=C.\n\nActually, the valid z for a given s is from C to min(D, s-1). So the count is: max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1)\n\nThen the answer is:\n   Sum_{x=A}^{B} Sum_{y=B}^{C} [ max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1) ]\n\nBut still, the double summation is too heavy.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can change the order: iterate over y from B to C, and then for each y, iterate over x from A to B, but that is the same as above.\n\nAnother idea: use prefix sums or cumulative sums.\n\nNote: The condition for z is independent of the particular x and y as long as we know s=x+y. So we can group by s.\n\nBut note: s = x+y. We can consider the range of s: from A+B to B+C.\n\nThen, for each s, we can compute:\n   Let L(s) = number of pairs (x,y) such that x in [A,B], y in [B,C] and x+y = s.\n\nThen the contribution for s is: L(s) * max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1)\n\nBut how to compute L(s)? \n\nWe can use two pointers or inclusion-exclusion. Alternatively, we can use a difference array.\n\nBut note: the constraints are up to 500,000, so we can do:\n\n   For s from A+B to B+C:\n        L(s) = number of x in [A, B] such that y = s - x is in [B, C].\n\n        Conditions: \n            A <= x <= B\n            B <= s-x <= C   =>   s-C <= x <= s-B.\n\n        So x must be in [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)] and also in [A, B] and [s-C, s-B]. Then we can use a difference array for s.\n\nBut note: the total s range is from A+B to B+C, which is about 500,000 - (A+B) to 500,000? Actually, the length of s is (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = (C-A+1) which can be up to 500,000.\n\nWe can iterate over s from A+B to B+C and for each s, we can compute the number of x in [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)].\n\nBut then we are iterating over s from A+B to B+C (about 500,000) and for each s we do a constant time operation? Actually, we just need to compute the interval for x and then the count is max(0, min(B, s-B) - max(A, s-C) + 1) if the lower bound is <= the upper bound, else 0.\n\nBut wait: the condition for x is: \n   x must be at least A and at least s-C, and at most B and at most s-B.\n\nSo:\n   low = max(A, s-C)\n   high = min(B, s-B)\n\nThen if low <= high, then L(s) = high - low + 1, else 0.\n\nThen the answer is:\n   ans = 0\n   for s from A+B to B+C:\n        low = max(A, s-C)\n        high = min(B, s-B)\n        if low <= high:\n            count_s = high - low + 1\n        else:\n            count_s = 0\n        # Now, for this s, the condition for z is: z in [C, min(D, s-1)]\n        if s-1 < C:\n            count_z = 0\n        else:\n            count_z = min(D, s-1) - C + 1\n            if count_z < 0:\n                count_z = 0\n        ans += count_s * count_z\n\nBut note: the range of s is from A+B to B+C, which is (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = (C-A+1) which is at most 500,000. So this loop is acceptable.\n\nHowever, note that s goes from A+B to B+C, and the number of s values is (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = (C - A + 1). Since A, B, C, D can be up to 500000, then C-A+1 can be up to 500000, so the loop runs about 500000 times. That is acceptable.\n\nBut wait: what if A+B is very small and B+C is very large? Actually, A+B is at least 1+1=2 (if A=1, B=1) and B+C is at most 500000+500000=1000000, so the range is 2 to 1000000, which is 999999, which is acceptable? Actually, the problem says A<=B<=C<=D, and all integers from 1 to 500000, so A+B can be as low as 1+1=2, and B+C can be as high as 500000+500000=1000000. Then the number of s values is 1000000-2+1 = 999999, which is about 1e6, which is acceptable in Python if we do a single pass.\n\nBut note: the input constraints say that A, B, C, D are between 1 and 500000, and A<=B<=C<=D. So the maximum s is B+C, and since B<=C, then B+C <= 2*C <= 1000000. The minimum s is A+B, and A>=1, B>=A, so minimum s is at least 2.\n\nSo the loop from s_min = A+B to s_max = B+C (inclusive) has about (B+C - A - B + 1) = (C - A + 1) steps. Since C-A+1 can be up to 500000 (if A=1, C=500000, then 500000 steps) but also note that the entire range of s is from A+B to B+C, and the length is (B+C - (A+B)) + 1 = (C - A + 1). \n\nWait, but if A=1, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000, then s_min=1+500000=500001, s_max=500000+500000=1000000, and the length is 500000. So worst-case the loop runs about 500000 times, which is acceptable.\n\nBut note: the example input: ['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000'].\n\nLet me test with the first example: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\ns_min = 1+2 = 3, s_max = 2+3=5.\n\nSo s from 3 to 5.\n\ns=3:\n   low = max(1, 3-3)=max(1,0)=1\n   high = min(2, 3-2)=min(2,1)=1 -> [1,1]: count_s=1\n   count_z: s-1=2, min(D,2)=2, so z from 3 to 2 -> invalid (since 3>2), so count_z=0.\n\ns=4:\n   low = max(1,4-3)=max(1,1)=1\n   high = min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2 -> [1,2]: count_s=2\n   count_z: s-1=3, min(D,3)=3, so z from 3 to 3 -> count_z=1 (since 3>=3 and 3<=3)\n\n   So for s=4: 2*1 = 2.\n\ns=5:\n   low = max(1,5-3)=max(1,2)=2\n   high = min(2,5-2)=min(2,3)=2 -> [2,2]: count_s=1\n   count_z: s-1=4, min(D,4)=4, so z from 3 to 4 -> count_z=2 (because 3 and 4)\n\n   So for s=5: 1*2=2.\n\nTotal = 0 + 2 + 2 = 4. Matches the example.\n\nSecond example: A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\ns_min=1+2=3, s_max=2+2=4.\n\ns=3:\n   low = max(1,3-2)=max(1,1)=1\n   high = min(2,3-2)=min(2,1)=1 -> count_s=1\n   count_z: s-1=2, min(D,2)=2, so z from 2 to 2 -> count_z=1 (since 2>=2 and 2<=2) [Note: our z must be at least C=2, so yes]\n   contribution: 1.\n\ns=4:\n   low = max(1,4-2)=max(1,2)=2\n   high = min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2 -> count_s=1\n   count_z: s-1=3, min(D,3)=3, so z from 2 to 3 -> count_z=2 (since 2<=3 and 2>=2, then z=2,3)\n   contribution: 1*2=2.\n\nTotal=1+2=3. Matches.\n\nThird example: A=500000, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000.\n\ns_min=500000+500000=1000000, s_max=500000+500000=1000000.\n\ns=1000000:\n   low = max(500000,1000000-500000)=max(500000,500000)=500000\n   high = min(500000,1000000-500000)=min(500000,500000)=500000 -> count_s=1\n   count_z: s-1=999999, min(D,999999)=500000 (because D=500000) -> so z from 500000 to 500000 -> count_z=1\n   Total=1.\n\nThis matches.\n\nBut note: we must be cautious with the boundaries. \n\nHowever, note that in the example above for the third example, the condition for z is [C, D] i.e., [500000,500000]. But the condition for the triangle is x+y>z. Here, x+y=1000000, and z=500000, so 500000+500000=1000000, which is not greater than 500000? Wait, wait: the triangle condition requires x+y>z. So 1000000 > 500000 is true. But wait, actually the condition is x+y>z, and here x+y=1000000, z=500000 -> 1000000>500000, so it's valid.\n\nBut note: the condition for z is z<=D=500000, and we are taking z from 500000 to min(500000, 999999) which is 500000. So we are including z=500000.\n\nBut wait: the condition for the triangle is strict inequality (non-degenerate). The example works.\n\nHowever, note that the above method uses a loop over s from A+B to B+C. The number of s values is (B+C - A - B + 1) = (C-A+1). This can be up to 500000, which is acceptable.\n\nBut note: the problem constraints say that A, B, C, D can be up to 500000, so the maximum s is 1000000, and the minimum s is at least 2, so the range of s is about 1000000, but note that we are only iterating from A+B to B+C, which is (C-A+1) numbers, and C-A+1 <= 500000, so we are iterating at most 500000 times.\n\nBut wait: what if A=1, B=500000, C=500000, then the range of s is from 500001 to 1000000, which is 500000 numbers. So worst-case 500000 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious because the numbers can be as large as 500000, and the operations inside the loop are constant time.\n\nBut note: there's a possibility to optimize by precomputing the function for s without a loop? Actually, we are already doing a linear iteration over s. \n\nBut wait, is there a way to avoid the loop? The problem constraints say that the input numbers are up to 500000, and the range of s is about 500000, so a loop of 500000 is acceptable in Python.\n\nHowever, we can also try to use mathematical formulas to avoid iterating over every s.\n\nBut let's stick to the direct method for now.\n\nCode:\n\nSteps:\n1. Read the four integers A, B, C, D.\n2. Set s_min = A+B, s_max = B+C.\n3. Initialize ans = 0.\n4. For s from s_min to s_max:\n      low_x = max(A, s - C)   # because y = s-x must be <= C -> x>=s-C, and x>=A.\n      high_x = min(B, s - B)   # because y = s-x must be >=B -> x<=s-B, and x<=B.\n      if low_x <= high_x:\n          count_s = high_x - low_x + 1\n      else:\n          count_s = 0\n\n      # Now, for z: we require z < s (so z <= s-1) and z>=C and z<=D.\n      # So the lower bound for z is C, the upper bound is min(D, s-1).\n      if s-1 < C:\n          count_z = 0\n      else:\n          count_z = min(D, s-1) - C + 1\n          # But if min(D, s-1) < C, then we set to 0. However, we already checked s-1>=C, so min(D, s-1) is at least C?\n          # Actually, if s-1 >= C, then min(D, s-1) might be less than C? No, because s-1>=C, then min(D, s-1) is at least min(D, C) but we don't know if D>=C. However, the input condition says A<=B<=C<=D, so D>=C. Therefore, min(D, s-1) >= min(C, s-1) and we know s-1>=C, so min(D, s-1) >= C? Actually, if s-1>=C, then min(D, s-1) is either D (if D<=s-1) or s-1 (if s-1<D). In any case, since s-1>=C, then min(D, s-1) >= C (because even if D<C, but we know D>=C, so actually min(D, s-1) >= C). Therefore, we can simply do:\n          #   count_z = min(D, s-1) - C + 1\n      # But we must ensure that min(D, s-1) >= C, which is true because s-1>=C (from the condition we set above) and D>=C, so the smallest min(D, s-1) is C (when s-1==C and D>=C). \n\n      ans += count_s * count_z\n\n5. Print ans.\n\nBut wait: what if s-1 < C? Then we set count_z=0. Otherwise, we set count_z = min(D, s-1) - C + 1.\n\nHowever, note that if s-1 < C, then there are no z (since z>=C and z<=s-1 < C). So that's correct.\n\nBut wait: what if D < C? But the input condition says A<=B<=C<=D, so D>=C, so we are safe.\n\nBut note: the above calculation for count_z: we do min(D, s-1) - C + 1. However, if min(D, s-1) < C, then we get negative. But we already set count_z=0 when s-1 < C. So the else branch only runs when s-1>=C, and then min(D, s-1) is at least C (because D>=C and s-1>=C, so the minimum of D and s-1 is at least C). So the expression is non-negative.\n\nBut wait: what if s-1 >= C and D < C? But D>=C by input, so we are safe.\n\nHowever, note: the input condition is A<=B<=C<=D, so D>=C, so we are good.\n\nBut wait: what if s-1 >= C, but D < s-1? Then we take min(D, s-1)=D, and then D-C+1. But if D < s-1, then we are only taking z from C to D (which is the entire allowed range for z, since D is the upper bound). And that's correct.\n\nBut note: the condition for z is z<=min(D, s-1). So if D < s-1, then we are limited by D.\n\nLet me test with an example: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, and s=5 (as above): \n   s-1=4, min(D,4)=4, then count_z=4-3+1=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=3: then for s=5, min(D,4)=3, count_z=3-3+1=1.\n\nBut wait: the condition for the triangle is x+y>z. In the example with D=3, then for s=5, z must be <=3, so z=3. Then the condition is 5>3 -> true. So there is one z.\n\nBut note: the example input condition is C<=D, so D>=3. So if D=3, then the condition is satisfied.\n\nBut wait, the problem states: \"C <= z <= D\", so if D=3, then z can only be 3. Then for s=5, we have one z.\n\nBut note: the example above for the first example with D=4, we had two z's for s=5.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nHowever, note: the above method iterates from s_min to s_max, which is (C-A+1) steps. But (C-A+1) can be negative? No, because C>=A (from A<=B<=C). \n\nBut wait: the problem says A<=B<=C<=D, so C>=A.\n\nBut note: the worst-case s_min = A+B, s_max = B+C, and the range is (B+C - A - B + 1) = (C-A+1). \n\nBut wait: what if A=1, B=2, C=3, then (C-A+1)=3, so we iterate 3 times (s=3,4,5). \n\nBut wait, the s_min is 3, s_max is 5, so the number of s values is 5-3+1=3.\n\nBut note: the range of s is from A+B to B+C, and the number of integers from a to b inclusive is (b-a+1). So the loop runs (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = (C - A + 1) times.\n\nBut wait, is that always true? \n\nYes: because the smallest s is A+B, the largest is B+C, so the count is (B+C) - (A+B) + 1 = C - A + 1.\n\nBut wait, in the example above: A=1, B=2, C=3: then C-A+1=3, and indeed we iterate from 3 to 5 (which is 3,4,5: 3 numbers). \n\nBut wait: what if A=2, B=3, C=4, then s_min=5, s_max=7, and the number of s is 3, which is 4-2+1=3. So that matches.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead A, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\n\ns_min = A+B\ns_max = B+C\nans = 0\n\nfor s in range(s_min, s_max+1):\n    # Determine the valid x range: [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)]\n    low_x = max(A, s - C)\n    high_x = min(B, s - B)\n    if low_x <= high_x:\n        count_s = high_x - low_x + 1\n    else:\n        count_s = 0\n\n    # Determine the valid z range: [C, min(D, s-1)]\n    if s-1 < C:\n        count_z = 0\n    else:\n        count_z = min(D, s-1) - C + 1\n\n    ans += count_s * count_z\n\nprint(ans)\n\nBut wait, I just realized: the condition for y is that y must be in [B, C]. And we are using y = s - x. But note: we require y>=B and y<=C. \n\nIn the calculation for x: \n   We set low_x = max(A, s-C) because from y<=C we get x>=s-C.\n   We set high_x = min(B, s-B) because from y>=B we get x<=s-B.\n\nBut note: the condition y>=B is equivalent to x<=s-B, and y<=C is equivalent to x>=s-C.\n\nHowever, we must also ensure that x is in [A, B] (given). So the valid x is the intersection of [A, B] and [s-C, s-B]. \n\nBut note: the condition for y being in [B, C] is exactly the conditions we used to define the interval for x.\n\nTherefore, the above is correct.\n\nBut wait: what if s-B is less than A? Then we use min(B, s-B) which would be s-B, but if s-B < A, then the interval [max(A, s-C), s-B] would have max(A, s-C) > s-B (because s-C <= s-B, but A might be larger than s-B). Then we set count_s=0. That is correct.\n\nBut note: the condition for x is both: x>=A and x>=s-C, and x<=B and x<=s-B. So the intersection is [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)].\n\nWe are doing that.\n\nBut wait: is the condition for y being in [B, C] correctly captured? \n\n   y = s-x, and we require B<=y<=C.\n   => B <= s-x <= C\n   => s-C <= x <= s-B.\n\nAnd then we intersect with [A, B]. So the valid x is [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)].\n\nCorrect.\n\nBut wait: what if s-B is less than A? Then the interval [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)] becomes [something >=A, something <A] -> empty. So that's correct.\n\nHowever, note that the condition for y being in [B, C] requires that s-B >= A? Not necessarily. We don't require that. It's just that if s-B < A, then there is no x in [A, B] that is <= s-B (because A>s-B) and also x>=A and x>=s-C. So the interval is empty.\n\nBut note: the condition s-B < A implies that the maximum x (which is B) is also less than s-B? Not necessarily, but we are taking the minimum of B and s-B. So if s-B < B, then we use s-B. But if s-B < A, then we are requiring x<=s-B and x>=A, which is impossible.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut wait: performance. The range of s is from A+B to B+C, which is (C-A+1) steps, and each step is O(1). Since C-A+1 can be up to 500000, which is acceptable.\n\nBut wait: the worst-case input is A=1, B=500000, C=500000, then the range of s is from 500001 to 1000000, which is 500000 steps. So worst-case 500000 iterations, which is acceptable in Python.\n\nBut note: the problem says that A, B, C, D can be up to 500000, and the worst-case for the loop is 500000 steps. \n\nBut wait: the condition in the loop for s: we are iterating from A+B to B+C, which is (C-A+1) steps. The worst-case is when C-A is maximum, which is 500000 (if A=1, C=500000). Then we do 500001 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut wait: 500000 iterations is acceptable in Python (in PyPy or CPython, 500000 iterations is fast).\n\nHowever, note that the problem constraints say that the numbers can be up to 500000, so we must be cautious about the arithmetic operations.\n\nBut the arithmetic operations in the loop are simple: a few comparisons and subtractions.\n\nLet me run the code on the provided examples.\n\nExample 1: ['1 2 3 4'] -> 4\nExample 2: ['1 2 2 5'] -> 3\nExample 3: ['500000 500000 500000 500000'] -> 1\n\nBut wait, the example 2: A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5 -> output 3.\n\nBut note: the example input was given as \"1 2 2 5\", so the code should read that.\n\nI tested the code above with the examples and it worked.\n\nBut wait: there is a potential issue with the condition for z: we require z < s, so z <= s-1. And we are counting z from C to min(D, s-1). \n\nBut note: the condition for the triangle is x+y>z, which is equivalent to z < x+y. So we are counting z from C to s-1 (if s-1<=D) or from C to D (if s-1>D). \n\nBut wait, the condition for z is also that z>=C. So we are correct.\n\nBut wait: what if s-1 < C? Then we skip. Correct.\n\nBut note: the condition for the triangle is x+y>z, and we are counting the z that are less than x+y. However, note that the condition for the triangle does not require z to be at least ...? Actually, the problem says: A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D. So z must be at least C. And we are only considering z>=C. So we are correct.\n\nOne more test: A=1, B=1, C=1, D=1. Then s_min=2, s_max=2.\n   s=2:\n        low_x = max(1, 2-1)=max(1,1)=1\n        high_x = min(1, 2-1)=min(1,1)=1 -> count_s=1\n        s-1=1, which is >=1, so count_z = min(1,1)-1+1 = 1-1+1=1.\n        ans=1.\n\nBut the triangle (1,1,1) is valid: 1+1>1 -> 2>1, so yes. There is one triangle.\n\nBut wait, the input condition: A<=B<=C<=D, and here A=B=C=D=1, so that's valid.\n\nBut note: the problem says A<=B<=C<=D, and 1<=1<=1<=1 is true.\n\nSo the code returns 1.\n\nBut wait: the example input: ['500000 500000 500000 500000'] returns 1, which we already saw.\n\nBut wait: the example input ['1 2 3 4'] returns 4, which is correct.\n\nBut wait: the example input ['1 2 2 5'] returns 3, which is correct.\n\nHowever, let me check with a small edge: A=1, B=1, C=2, D=3.\n\nThen s_min=2, s_max=1+2=3.\n\ns=2:\n   low_x = max(1,2-2)=max(1,0)=1\n   high_x = min(1,2-1)=min(1,1)=1 -> count_s=1\n   s-1=1, which is <2 -> count_z=0.\n\ns=3:\n   low_x = max(1,3-2)=max(1,1)=1\n   high_x = min(1,3-1)=min(1,2)=1 -> count_s=1\n   s-1=2, which is >=2 -> count_z = min(3,2)-2+1 = 2-2+1=1.\n\nTotal=1.\n\nNow, what triangles are there?\n   x in [1,1] -> x=1\n   y in [1,2] -> y=1 or 2, but wait: the condition is B<=y<=C, so y must be in [1,2] (since B=1, C=2). But wait, the input condition is A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D, so x=1, then y must be in [B, C] i.e., [1,2]. But note: the condition says B<=y, and B=1, so y can be 1 or 2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"the inequality A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D holds\". So for x=1, then y must be at least B (which is 1) and at most C (which is 2). Then z must be at least C (2) and at most D (3).\n\nNow, the triangles:\n\nx=1, y=1, z: must be at least 2 and at most 3. Then check triangle: 1+1>z -> 2>z. But z>=2, so z=2: 1+1=2, which is not >2 -> degenerate. So not allowed. z=3: 1+1=2<3 -> not allowed.\n\nx=1, y=2, z: from 2 to 3.\n\nTriangle: 1+2>z -> 3>z. \n   z=2: 3>2 -> valid.\n   z=3: 3>3 -> false.\n\nSo only one triangle: (1,2,2).\n\nBut our code returns 1.\n\nWait, why did the s=2 part give 0 and s=3 part give 1? \n\nIn s=3: x+y=3. Then x=1, y=2. Then we require z < 3, and z>=2. So z=2 is the only one. So count_z=1. Then the product is 1.\n\nBut wait, how did we",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is strictly greater than the third side. Given the constraints, the most restrictive condition is \\(x + y > z\\), as \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\) implies the other inequalities hold automatically.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires counting all valid triples \\((x, y, z)\\) where \\(x\\) ranges from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), \\(y\\) from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\), and \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), such that \\(x + y > z\\). The key insight is that for each possible sum \\(s = x + y\\), the valid \\(z\\) values must be in the range \\([C, \\min(D, s-1)]\\).\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: We iterate over all possible sums \\(s\\) from \\(A + B\\) to \\(B + C\\). For each sum \\(s\\), we determine the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x + y = s\\), \\(x \\in [A, B]\\), and \\(y \\in [B, C]\\). This is done by calculating the valid range for \\(x\\) as \\([\\max(A, s - C), \\min(B, s - B)]\\). The number of valid \\(x\\) values gives the count of pairs for that sum. \n\n3. **Counting Valid \\(z\\) Values**: For each sum \\(s\\), the number of valid \\(z\\) values is the count of integers in \\([C, \\min(D, s-1)]\\). This is computed as \\(\\max(0, \\min(D, s-1) - C + 1)\\) if \\(s-1 \\geq C\\), otherwise zero.\n\n4. **Combining Results**: The total number of valid triangles is the sum over all \\(s\\) of the product of the number of valid \\((x, y)\\) pairs and the number of valid \\(z\\) values for that sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    s_min = A + B\n    s_max = B + C\n    ans = 0\n    for s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n        low_x = max(A, s - C)\n        high_x = min(B, s - B)\n        if low_x <= high_x:\n            count_s = high_x - low_x + 1\n        else:\n            count_s = 0\n        if s - 1 < C:\n            count_z = 0\n        else:\n            count_z = min(D, s - 1) - C + 1\n        ans += count_s * count_z\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of four integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) which define the ranges for the sides of the triangle.\n2. **Initialization**: `s_min` and `s_max` are calculated as the minimum and maximum possible sums of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), respectively.\n3. **Iterating Over Sums**: For each sum \\(s\\) from `s_min` to `s_max`, the code determines the valid range for \\(x\\) such that \\(y = s - x\\) lies within \\([B, C]\\).\n4. **Counting Valid Pairs and Z Values**: For each sum \\(s\\), the number of valid \\((x, y)\\) pairs is calculated. The number of valid \\(z\\) values is derived based on the condition \\(z < s\\).\n5. **Result Calculation**: The product of valid pairs and \\(z\\) values for each sum \\(s\\) is added to the total count.\n6. **Output**: The total count of non-degenerate triangles is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts all valid triangles by leveraging mathematical insights and careful range calculations, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
