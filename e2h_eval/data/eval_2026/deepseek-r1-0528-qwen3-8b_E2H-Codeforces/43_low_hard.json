He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed that the string only contains 'a','b','c'\n Conditions:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from the problem statement, because A appended some 'b's and B appended some 'c's, but note: the problem says \"at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string\" after B appends the 'b's). However, note that C appends 'c's and the condition on the number of 'c's is given relative to the entire string (which now includes the original a's and the appended b's) so we must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and then the condition for 'c' applies.\n\n Steps:\n - The process: \n   Step 1: A has a string of some number of 'a's.\n   Step 2: B appends some number of 'b's (so the string from A is the prefix of all 'a's, then comes the 'b's).\n   Step 3: C appends some number of 'c's, which must be equal to the total number of 'a's OR the total number of 'b's (in the entire string after B's appending) or both.\n\n Important: The entire string must be such that the 'a's come first (from A), then the 'b's (from B), then the 'c's (from C). But note: the problem says that C appends at the end. So the order should be: \n   [some a's] [some b's] [some c's]\n\n However, note the example: \"aabc\" -> YES. Let's break down \"aabc\":\n   Count: \n     a: 2\n     b: 1\n     c: 1\n   Condition: the number of 'c' (which is 1) equals the number of 'b' (which is 1). Also, the order is: \n        starts with 'a's (at least one), then 'b's (at least one? Actually, note: B appends some number of 'b's, which could be zero? But wait, the problem says \"B appends some number of letters 'b'\", and also the condition says \"at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist\". So there must be at least one 'b'. Similarly, C appends some number of 'c' (could be zero? but the condition says the number of 'c' is equal to the count of 'a' or 'b'. If the string originally (after A and B) has at least one 'a' and one 'b', then the number of 'c' is set to either the count of 'a' or 'b' (which are positive). However, note that the problem says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\". \n\n But note: the entire string includes the 'c's that C appends. Wait, let me clarify:\n\n After B appends, the string has:\n   count_a = (original a's) \n   count_b = (appended by B)\n\n Then C appends count_c such that count_c = count_a OR count_c = count_b.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' in the string\" (meaning the string at the time of C's turn? But note: the string at the time of C's turn is the one after B's appending, i.e., without the 'c's. Then C appends exactly that many 'c's. So the final string will have:\n   total_c = count_c (which is either count_a or count_b from the string before C's appending)\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\" and then the condition is on the string that is given to C (i.e., without the c's) for the counts of 'a' and 'b'.\n\n However, note: the problem states \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\" — meaning the string that C receives, which is the string after B's appending.\n\n But the example: \"aaabccc\" — \n   Original string from A: \"aaa\"\n   Then B appends \"b\": so becomes \"aaab\"\n   Then C appends \"ccc\" (3 times). Now, the number of 'a' in the string that C received was 3, and the number of 'b' was 1. So 3 is the number of 'a', so condition holds.\n\n However, note",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by following a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' under certain conditions. The key insight is that the string must adhere to a strict order where all 'a's come first, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's appended must either match the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string before any 'c's were added.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Non-decreasing Order**: The string must start with one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, and then one or more 'c's. Any deviation from this order (like an 'a' after a 'b' or a 'b' after a 'c') makes the string invalid.\n2. **Count Characters**: Calculate the counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the string.\n3. **Validate Conditions**: Ensure there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's (or both). If all these conditions are met, the string is valid; otherwise, it is not.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    \n    if 'b' in s and 'c' in s and 'a' in s:\n        n = len(s)\n        i = 0\n        while i < n and s[i] == 'a':\n            i += 1\n        j = i\n        while j < n and s[j] == 'b':\n            j += 1\n        k = j\n        while k < n and s[k] == 'c':\n            k += 1\n            \n        if k != n:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n        count_a = i\n        count_b = j - i\n        count_c = n - j\n        \n        if count_a >= 1 and count_b >= 1 and (count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace.\n2. **Initial Checks**: The code checks if the string contains at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. If not, it immediately outputs \"NO\".\n3. **Order Validation**: The code traverses the string to ensure all 'a's come before 'b's, which in turn come before 'c's. If this order is violated, it prints \"NO\".\n4. **Count Validation**: The counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' are calculated. The presence of at least one 'a' and one 'b' is verified. The number of 'c's must match either the count of 'a's or 'b's. If all conditions are satisfied, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the structural and numerical conditions required for the string to be valid according to the problem's specifications.",
