Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering the gaps between lanterns and the ends.\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the list of lantern positions.\n 2. The entire street must be covered from 0 to l.\n 3. Consider two parts: \n    a) The left end: from 0 to the first lantern.\n    b) The right end: from the last lantern to l.\n    c) The gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n 4. For the left end: we need at least (first lantern's position) / 2 to cover from 0 to the first lantern.\n    But actually, if the first lantern is at position a0, then the radius needed to cover from 0 to a0 is a0/2.\n    However, note that we might have multiple lanterns. But for the left end, we only consider the gap from 0 to the first lantern.\n\n 5. Similarly, for the right end: (l - last lantern) / 2.\n\n 6. For the gaps between consecutive lanterns (after sorting):\n    Suppose we have two consecutive lanterns at positions a[i] and a[i+1]. The gap between them is (a[i+1] - a[i]).\n    The required radius for this gap is (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.\n\n 7. However, note: the entire street is lit if every point is within d of at least one lantern.\n    The critical points are the gaps. But note: the lanterns themselves are points and they light a segment of length 2*d.\n\n 8. Actually, we can think of it as:\n    - The leftmost part: from 0 to the first lantern must be covered by the first lantern -> so d must be at least (first lantern's position) / 2? Not exactly.\n\n    Let me clarify with an example: \n      Input: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n      Here, the street is from 0 to 5, with lanterns at 2 and 5.\n      The left gap: from 0 to 2. The first lantern at 2 must cover from 0 to 4 (if d=2). But wait, the sample output is 2.0.\n\n    How does the coverage work?\n      The first lantern at 2 with radius d must cover from (2-d) to (2+d). Since we require to cover 0, we must have 2-d <= 0? \n        Actually, the condition is that the lantern covers all points within d. So the leftmost point 0 must be in [2-d, 2+d]. \n        Therefore, 2-d <= 0 => d >= 2. And also, the rightmost point 5 must be covered by the second lantern at 5: so 5+d >= 5? \n        Actually, the condition for 5 is that the second lantern must cover up to 5+d, but since the street ends at 5, we require that the second lantern's coverage extends at least to 5. \n        However, note that the second lantern is at 5, so it covers [5-d, 5+d]. To cover 5, we don't require anything beyond 5, so 5-d <= 5 is always true. But wait, what if the first lantern doesn't cover the entire gap?\n\n    Actually, the entire street must be covered. The gap between the two lanterns is from 2 to 5. The first lantern covers up to 2+d, and the second lantern covers from 5-d to 5+d. \n    We require that the entire street [0,5] is covered. So the first lantern must cover from 0 to 2+d, and the second lantern must cover from 5-d to 5. But note, the middle part from 2 to 5 must be covered by both? \n\n    Alternatively, we can think of the maximum distance from any point to the nearest lantern. We want the minimum d such that the union of intervals [a_i - d, a_i + d] covers [0, l].\n\n    The necessary conditions are:\n      Condition 1: d >= a0 (the first lantern must reach 0: so d >= a0)\n      Condition 2: d >= l - a[-1] (the last lantern must reach l: so d >= l - a[-1])\n      Condition 3: For each consecutive pair (a_i, a_{i+1}), we need d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2 because the midpoint between the two lanterns is (a_i + a_{i+1])/2, and the distance from either lantern to the midpoint is (a_{i+1]-a_i)/2.\n\n    However, note: Condition 1 and Condition 2 are actually different. In Condition 1, we require the first lantern to cover from 0 to a0+d. To cover 0, we require a0+d >= 0, which is always true if d>=0. But wait, the requirement is that 0 is covered by the first lantern, meaning 0 must be in [a0-d, a0+d]. This gives: a0-d <= 0 <= a0+d. The right side (0<=a0+d) is always true because a0>=0 and d>=0. The left side requires d >= a0. Similarly, for the last lantern, we require l to be in [a_last-d, a_last+d], so a_last+d >= l => d >= l - a_last.\n\n    But wait, what about the gaps in the middle? Consider two lanterns at positions x and y (x < y). The first lantern covers [x-d, x+d] and the second covers [y-d, y+d]. The gap between x+d and y-d must be non-positive to avoid an unlit segment. Therefore, we require x+d >= y-d => 2*d >= y-x => d >= (y-x)/2.\n\n    So the conditions are:\n      d >= max( \n          a0, \n          l - a[-1],\n          max_{i}( (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2 )   for i from 0 to n-2\n      )\n\n    However, note: the condition for the left end is not necessarily a0. Let me check with the example \"2 5\\n2 5\":\n        Conditions:\n          Condition 1: d >= 2 (because first lantern at 2, so to cover 0: d>=2)\n          Condition 2: d >= 5-5 = 0 (so no constraint from the last lantern)\n          Condition 3: (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n\n        Then d must be at least max(2, 0, 1.5) = 2.0 -> matches.\n\n    Another example: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n        First sort: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n        Condition 1: d >= 0 (from the first lantern at 0, so no constraint from left end? Actually, the first lantern is at 0, so it will cover from -d to d. But we only care about [0,15]. The left end is 0, so we require d>=0 (which is trivial). \n        Condition 2: d >= 15-15 = 0 (trivial).\n        Condition 3: gaps between consecutive lanterns:\n            3-0 = 3 -> 1.5\n            5-3 = 2 -> 1.0\n            7-5 = 2 -> 1.0\n            9-7 = 2 -> 1.0\n            14-9 = 5 -> 2.5\n            15-14 = 1 -> 0.5\n        Then d >= max(0,0,1.5,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.5,0.5) = 2.5 -> matches.\n\n    But wait, why is the left end condition just the first lantern's position? Actually, the first lantern is at 0, so it covers [-d, d]. We only care about [0, d] for the left part. But the requirement is to cover 0, which is already included. However, if the first lantern is not at 0, then we must have d at least the distance from 0 to the first lantern.\n\n    However, note: the condition for the left end is not just the first lantern's position, but the entire segment from 0 to the first lantern. The first lantern at position a0 must cover the point 0. The distance from the first lantern to 0 is a0. Therefore, d must be at least a0 (so that the interval [a0-d, a0+d] includes 0).\n\n    Similarly, for the last lantern at position a_last, the distance from a_last to l is (l - a_last), so d must be at least (l - a_last).\n\n    Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n    Step 1: Read n, l.\n    Step 2: Read the list of n integers and sort it.\n    Step 3: If there are no lanterns, then we need d such that the whole street [0, l] is covered. But the problem states n>=1, so we can skip handling n=0.\n\n    Step 4: \n        candidate1 = the first lantern's position (to cover the left end: d >= candidate1)\n        candidate2 = l - last lantern's position (to cover the right end: d >= candidate2)\n\n    Step 5: For consecutive lanterns, compute the gaps: for i in range(n-1): gap = lanterns[i+1] - lanterns[i]; then the required d for that gap is gap/2.\n\n    Step 6: The answer is the maximum of candidate1, candidate2, and all the (gap/2) for consecutive gaps.\n\n    However, note: the above reasoning for the left end and right end is correct because:\n        Left end: without the first lantern, the segment [0, a0] must be covered by the first lantern. The farthest point from the first lantern on the left is 0, which is at distance a0. So d must be at least a0.\n\n        But wait: what if there is more than one lantern? Actually, the entire street must be covered. However, the left end is only concerned by the first lantern because the next lantern is at a0 (or beyond) and cannot help covering the left of a0. Similarly, the right end is only the last lantern's responsibility.\n\n    However, let me test with an example that has more than one lantern and the first lantern is not at 0.\n\n    Example: n=3, l=10, lanterns at [2, 5, 8]\n        Condition 1: d >= 2 (to cover 0 from the first lantern)\n        Condition 2: d >= 10-8 = 2 (to cover 10 from the last lantern)\n        Condition 3: gaps:\n            gap1: 5-2=3 -> d>=1.5\n            gap2: 8-5=3 -> d>=1.5\n\n        Then the maximum is 2.0.\n\n        Now, check: \n          With d=2.0, \n            first lantern at 2: covers [0,4]\n            second lantern at 5: covers [3,7]\n            third lantern at 8: covers [6,10]\n\n        The entire street [0,10] is covered? \n          [0,4] by first, then from 4 to 3? Wait, there's a gap between 4 and 3? Actually, the first lantern covers up to 4, the second starts at 3. So from 3 to 4 is covered by both. Then the second covers from 3 to 7, so from 4 to 7 is covered. Then the third covers from 6 to 10. So the entire street is covered.\n\n    But wait, what if we choose d=1.5?\n        Then first lantern: [0.5, 3.5]\n        Second lantern: [3.5, 6.5]\n        Third lantern: [6.5, 10.5] (but we only need to 10)\n\n        Now, the point 0 is not covered (since 0 < 0.5). Also, the point 10 is covered by the third lantern? 10 is in [6.5,10.5] -> yes. But 0 is not. So d must be at least 2.\n\n    However, note: the condition for the left end is that the first lantern must cover 0. The distance from 0 to the first lantern is 2, so d must be at least 2.\n\n    Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        # If there is only one lantern, then we have two conditions: cover from 0 to l.\n        # Conditions: d >= a[0] (to cover 0) and d >= l - a[0] (to cover l). Also, there are no consecutive gaps (unless n==1, then consecutive gaps loop doesn't run). But wait, if n==1, then we have only one lantern. Then the entire street must be covered by that one lantern. So the lantern must cover from 0 to l. The distance from the lantern to 0 is a0, and to l is l - a0. Then d must be at least max(a0, l - a0). Our method would take:\n        #   candidate1 = a0\n        #   candidate2 = l - a0\n        #   no consecutive gaps, so the maximum is max(candidate1, candidate2) -> which is correct.\n\n        candidates = []\n\n        # Left end: from 0 to the first lantern\n        if n == 0:\n            # According to the problem, n>=1, so we skip.\n            pass\n        else:\n            candidates.append(a[0])   # because d must be at least a[0] to cover 0 from the first lantern.\n\n            # Right end: from the last lantern to l\n            candidates.append(l - a[-1])\n\n            # Consecutive gaps\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n                # The required d for the gap between two consecutive lanterns is half the gap (to cover the midpoint)\n                # But note: the entire gap must be covered by the two lanterns. The maximum gap that two lanterns separated by 'gap' can cover is 2*d >= gap -> d >= gap/2.\n                candidates.append(gap / 2)\n\n        # However, wait: for consecutive gaps, we are only considering the gap between a[i-1] and a[i]. But the condition for the gap between two lanterns is that d must be at least half the gap. But note: the two lanterns together must cover the entire gap. The first lantern covers up to a[i-1]+d and the second lantern covers from a[i]-d. We require a[i-1]+d >= a[i]-d -> 2*d >= a[i] - a[i-1]. So d >= (a[i] - a[i-1])/2.\n\n        # But note: the above condition for consecutive gaps is independent of the ends.\n\n        # Therefore, we need to take the maximum value among all these conditions.\n\n        ans = max(candidates) if candidates else 0.0\n\n        # Format the answer to have 10 decimal places as in the example.\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n    However, wait: is the left end condition correctly captured by candidate1 = a[0]? \n        Example: n=1, l=10, a=[5]\n        Then candidates = [5, 10-5=5] -> so max=5.0. \n        Then the lantern at 5 must cover from 0 to 10. The distance from 5 to 0 is 5, so d must be at least 5. Similarly, the distance from 5 to 10 is 5. So 5 is correct.\n\n    But consider: n=1, l=10, a=[0] (lantern at the beginning)\n        Then candidate1 = 0, candidate2 = 10-0=10. Then max=10. \n        This is correct because the lantern at 0 must cover from 0 to 10. The distance from 0 to 10 is 10, so d>=10.\n\n    Another edge: n=1, l=10, a=[10] (lantern at the end)\n        candidate1 = 10, candidate2 = 0 -> max=10.\n\n    Another edge: n=2, l=10, a=[0,10]\n        candidate1 = 0, candidate2 = 0, consecutive gap: (10-0)/2 = 5 -> max=5.\n\n    Check: d=5, then the first lantern covers [-5,5] (we only need [0,5]), and the second lantern covers [5,15] (we only need [5,10]). So the entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n    But wait: the condition for the left end is 0, which is satisfied by d>=0, and the right end is 0, and the gap requires 5. So d=5 is the minimal.\n\n    However, consider the consecutive gap: the gap is 10 (from 0 to 10). The condition for the gap is d>=5. But note, the two lanterns are at the ends. The entire street is covered by the two lanterns with d=5. So it's correct.\n\n    But note: the above consecutive gap calculation uses the gap between consecutive lanterns. In the sorted list, the consecutive gap is 10-0=10, so we use 10/2=5.\n\n    One more: n=3, l=10, a=[0,5,10]\n        candidate1: 0\n        candidate2: 0\n        gaps: 5-0=5 -> 2.5, 10-5=5 -> 2.5\n        so d>=2.5\n\n        With d=2.5, the first lantern covers [-2.5, 2.5] (so [0,2.5] is covered), the second covers [2.5,7.5], the third covers [7.5,12.5]. The entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n    It seems correct.\n\n    However, wait: what if the lanterns are not covering the entire street because of the way we break the problem? \n        We have three conditions: left end, right end, and gaps. Each condition must be met. The maximum of these conditions is the minimal d.\n\n    Therefore, the code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        candidates = []\n\n        # If there is at least one lantern\n        candidates.append(a[0])   # for the left end: d must be at least a[0] (distance from 0 to the first lantern)\n\n        candidates.append(l - a[-1])   # for the right end: d must be at least (l - a[-1])\n\n        # For gaps between consecutive lanterns\n        for i in range(1, len(a)):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n            # The required d for this gap is gap/2, because the two lanterns must together cover the gap: the midpoint is at (a[i-1] + a[i])/2, and the distance from either lantern to the midpoint is gap/2.\n            candidates.append(gap / 2)\n\n        ans = max(candidates) if candidates else 0.0\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n    But wait: what if there are duplicate lanterns? The problem says: \"Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point.\" \n\n    Example: n=2, l=10, a=[5,5]\n        Then sorted: [5,5]\n        candidate1 = 5\n        candidate2 = 10-5=5\n        gap = 5-5=0 -> 0/2=0\n        Then ans = 5.\n\n        Check: with d=5, the two lanterns at 5 will cover [-0,10] (each lantern covers [0,10]). So the entire street is covered.\n\n    Another example: n=3, l=10, a=[5,5,5]\n        Then gaps: [5-5=0, 5-5=0] -> so two zeros.\n        candidates = [5, 5, 0,0] -> max=5.\n\n    So it works.\n\n    However, note: the problem constraints say n>=1, so we don't need to handle n=0.\n\n    Let me run the provided examples:\n\n    Example 1: Input \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n        Sorting: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n        candidate1: 0\n        candidate2: 15-15=0\n        gaps: \n            3-0 -> 3/2=1.5\n            5-3 -> 2/2=1.0\n            7-5 -> 2/2=1.0\n            9-7 -> 2/2=1.0\n            14-9 ->5/2=2.5\n            15-14->1/2=0.5\n        Then max = 2.5 -> output 2.5000000000 -> matches.\n\n    Example 2: Input \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n        Sorted: [2,5]\n        candidate1: 2\n        candidate2: 5-5=0\n        gap: (5-2)=3 -> 1.5\n        Then max = 2 -> output 2.0000000000 -> matches.\n\n    But wait, in the example 2, the gap is 3, so the condition for the gap is 1.5, but the left end condition is 2, so the answer is 2.\n\n    However, note: the left end condition is 2, and the gap condition is 1.5, so the maximum is 2. This is correct.\n\n    But wait, why do we have the gap condition then? Because even if the left end condition is the limiting factor, the gap condition might be the limiting factor in other cases.\n\n    The code is as below.\n\n    However, note: the condition for the left end is actually the entire segment from 0 to the first lantern. The first lantern must cover the entire segment from 0 to the first lantern. The distance from the first lantern to 0 is a0, so d must be at least a0. Similarly for the right end.\n\n    The gap condition is for the gaps between lanterns. The two lanterns at the ends of a gap must together cover the entire gap. The minimal d for that gap is half the gap.\n\n    Therefore, the solution is complete.\n\n    But note: the problem statement says \"Print the minimum light radius d\", and our approach computes the minimal d that satisfies all conditions.\n\n    However, there is an alternative approach: we can think of the entire street being covered by the union of the lanterns. The minimal d must be at least the maximum of:\n        - the distance from 0 to the first lantern (a0)\n        - the distance from l to the last lantern (l - a[-1])\n        - half the gap between consecutive lanterns (for each consecutive pair)\n\n    And that's exactly what we did.\n\n    Code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n        candidates = [a[0]]  # left end\n        candidates.append(l - a[-1])  # right end\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n            candidates.append(gap / 2)\n\n        ans = max(candidates) if candidates else 0.0\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n    However, wait: what if n=0? The problem states n>=1, so we don't have to worry. But if n==0, then we should output 0.0? The problem says n>=1, so we skip.\n\n    Let me submit the code as per the above.\n\n    But wait: what if the street is very long and we have many lanterns? The algorithm is O(n) which is acceptable for n<=1000.\n\n    Let me test with the example: n=1, l=1000000000, a=[500000000] -> then d must be at least max(500000000, 500000000) = 500000000.\n\n    The code:\n\n        n, l = 1, 1000000000\n        a = [500000000]\n        candidates = [500000000, 500000000] -> then max=500000000.0 -> correct.\n\n    I think we are good.\n\n    However, wait: the problem says the lanterns may be located at the ends of the street. That is handled by the right end condition.\n\n    Example: n=1, l=10, a=[0] -> d = max(0, 10) = 10 -> correct.\n\n    Example: n=1, l=10, a=[10] -> d = max(10,0) = 10 -> correct.\n\n    Example: n=1, l=10, a=[5] -> d = max(5,5)=5 -> correct.\n\n    Example: n=2, l=10, a=[0,10] -> d = max(0,0, (10-0)/2=5) -> 5 -> correct.\n\n    Example: n=3, l=10, a=[0,5,10] -> d = max(0,0, (5-0)/2=2.5, (10-5)/2=2.5) -> 2.5 -> correct.\n\n    Example: n=4, l=10, a=[0,2,4,6] -> \n        candidates: \n            left: 0\n            right: 10-6=4\n            gaps: (2-0)/2=1, (4-2)/2=1, (6-4)/2=1\n        Then max=4.0 -> d=4.0.\n\n        Check: the first lantern at 0 with d=4 covers [-4,4] (so [0,4] is covered). The second lantern at 2 with d=4 covers [-2,6] (so [0,6] is covered). The third lantern at 4 with d=4 covers [0,8]. The fourth lantern at 6 with d=4 covers [2,10]. \n        But wait, the entire street [0,10] is covered? \n          0 to 10: \n          0 is covered by first, second, third, fourth.\n          10: the fourth lantern: 6+4=10 -> covered.\n\n        So yes, d=4.0 is the minimal.\n\n    However, wait: is there a smaller d? \n        We must cover from 6 to 10. The last lantern is at 6, so to cover 10 we need d>=4. So 4 is the minimal.\n\n    Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n    Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n    Note: the input might have negative numbers? The problem says: \"0 ≤ ai ≤ l\", so no negatives.\n\n    Code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n        candidates = [a[0], l - a[-1]]  # start with left and right\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n            candidates.append(gap / 2)\n\n        ans = max(candidates) if candidates else 0.0\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n    But wait: if n==0, then we don't enter the for loop and we have an empty list. The problem says n>=1, so we can assume n>=1.\n\n    However, let me adjust to make sure: if n==0, then we have no lanterns. Then we need to cover the entire street [0,l] with no lanterns. The minimal d must be such that the entire street is covered. But note: without any lantern, we cannot cover the street unless d is infinity? But the problem states n>=1, so we ignore.\n\n    But to be safe, if n==0, then we have to cover the street [0,l] with no lantern. However, the problem says n>=1, so we don't need to handle.\n\n    Final code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n        # If there is at least one lantern, we proceed. Otherwise, if n==0, then we have to do something else, but the problem says n>=1.\n        candidates = []\n        if n == 0:\n            # According to the problem, n>=1, so we don't expect this, but let's be cautious.\n            # The minimal d must be such that the entire street [0, l] is covered. Without any lantern, we cannot cover unless we use d=infinity, but that's not possible. However, the problem says n>=1, so we skip.\n            # But if we do, then we must cover [0,l] with no lantern. The minimal d would be the maximum of the distances from the leftmost point (which is 0) to the rightmost (which is l) but without any lantern, we can't do it. However, the problem constraints say n>=1, so we don't handle.\n            pass\n        else:\n            candidates.append(a[0])\n            candidates.append(l - a[-1])\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                candidates.append((a[i] - a[i-1]) / 2)\n\n        # Since n>=1, the else branch runs and candidates is non-empty.\n        ans = max(candidates)\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n    But wait, what if n==0? The problem says n>=1, so we can remove the if-else and just do:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n        candidates = [a[0], l - a[-1]]\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            candidates.append((a[i] - a[i-1]) / 2)\n\n        ans = max(candidates)\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n    However, when n==1, the for loop runs from 1 to 0 (if n=1, then range(1,1) is empty) so that's okay.\n\n    But wait: the problem says n>=1, so we don't have to worry about n==0.\n\n    Let me test with n=1 and the examples.\n\n    Example n=1, l=10, a=[5]: \n        candidates = [5, 10-5=5] -> then for loop runs from 1 to 0 (so no iterations). Then ans = 5.0 -> correct.\n\n    Example n=2, l=10, a=[0,10]:\n        candidates = [0, 10-10=0] -> then for i in range(1,2): i=1 -> gap = a[1]-a[0]=10-0=10 -> append 10/2=5. Then candidates=[0,0,5] -> ans=5.0 -> correct.\n\n    Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n        candidates = [a[0], l - a[-1]]\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            candidates.append((a[i] - a[i-1]) / 2)\n\n        ans = max(candidates)\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n    However, wait: the example with n=1 and a=[0] (or a=[l]) is correct.\n\n    But wait, the problem says: \"The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\" and we are including those.\n\n    One more: n=1, l=10, a=[0] -> candidates = [0, 10] -> max=10.0 -> correct.\n\n    n=1, l=10, a=[10] -> candidates = [10, 0] -> max=10.0 -> correct.\n\n    n=2, l=10, a=[0,0] -> \n        sorted: [0,0]\n        candidates = [0, 10] -> then gap: a[1]-a[0]=0 -> 0/2=0 -> then max(0,10,0)=10.0 -> correct.\n\n    n=2, l=10, a=[0,5] -> \n        candidates = [0, 5] -> gap: (5-0)/2=2.5 -> max(0,5,2.5)=5.0 -> correct.\n\n    All tests passed.\n\n    However, wait: the example in the problem: \n        Input: \"2 5\\n2 5\" -> our code: \n            n=2, l=5, a=[2,5]\n            candidates = [2, 5-5=0] -> then gap: (5-2)/2=1.5 -> max(2,0,1.5)=2.0 -> correct.\n\n    Therefore, we output the code as below.\n\n    But note: the problem says the input is given as two lines. The first line is two integers, the second line is n integers.\n\n    The code reads from stdin.\n\n    Let me run the provided example inputs.\n\n    Example 1: \n        Input: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n\n        n=7, l=15\n        a = [15,5,3,7,9,14,0] -> sorted: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\n        candidates = [0, 15-15=0] -> then gaps: \n            i=1: 3-0=3 -> 1.5\n            i=2: 5-3=2 -> 1.0\n            i=3: 7-5=2 -> 1.0\n            i=4: 9-7=2 -> 1.0\n            i=5: 14-9=5 -> 2.5\n            i=6: 15-14=1 -> 0.5\n\n        Then max(0,0,1.5,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.5,0.5) = 2.5 -> output 2.5000000000\n\n    Example 2:\n        Input: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n        Output: 2.0000000000\n\n    The code is ready.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` required for all lanterns to illuminate the entire street from point `0` to point `l`. The lanterns are placed at specific positions along the street, and each lantern lights all points within a distance `d` from its position. The goal is to find the smallest `d` such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The street is represented as a line segment from `0` to `l`. The lanterns are positioned at various points along this segment. The key observation is that the entire street must be covered by the union of intervals `[a_i - d, a_i + d]` for each lantern at position `a_i`. The minimal `d` must satisfy three conditions:\n   - **Left End Coverage**: The first lantern must cover the point `0`, so `d` must be at least the distance from `0` to the first lantern.\n   - **Right End Coverage**: The last lantern must cover the point `l`, so `d` must be at least the distance from `l` to the last lantern.\n   - **Gap Coverage**: For any two consecutive lanterns, the midpoint between them must be within `d` of both lanterns. This requires `d` to be at least half the distance between consecutive lanterns.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Sorting**: The positions of the lanterns are sorted to process them in order.\n   - **Conditions Calculation**: Compute the required `d` for each of the three conditions (left end, right end, and gaps between consecutive lanterns) and take the maximum value among them. This maximum value ensures all parts of the street are covered.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the list of lantern positions takes `O(n log n)` time. The subsequent steps involve a linear scan through the sorted list, which is `O(n)`. Thus, the overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 1000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    candidates = [a[0], l - a[-1]]\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        candidates.append(gap / 2)\n        \n    ans = max(candidates)\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns `n`, the length of the street `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to process them in ascending order.\n3. **Candidate Calculation**: \n   - The first candidate is the distance from the start of the street (`0`) to the first lantern.\n   - The second candidate is the distance from the end of the street (`l`) to the last lantern.\n   - For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the third candidate is half the distance between them, ensuring their combined coverage covers the gap between them.\n4. **Result Determination**: The maximum value among all candidates is the minimal `d` required to illuminate the entire street. This value is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all critical segments of the street to determine the minimal light radius needed, ensuring optimal coverage with the least possible energy consumption.",
