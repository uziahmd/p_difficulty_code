He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\n Rudolf's snowflake is defined as follows:\n  - Start with one vertex.\n  - Then, the initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Now we have 1 + k vertices.\n  - Then, each vertex that has degree 1 (i.e., connected to only one other vertex) must be connected to k more new vertices. This step is done at least once.\n\n However, note that after the first expansion, we have k leaves. Then in the next expansion, each leaf becomes a node with k new connections. But wait: when we add k new vertices to a leaf, that leaf now gets connected to k new ones, so the leaf becomes an internal node (with degree k+1) and the new nodes are leaves.\n\n Actually, let's break down the process:\n\n Step 0: 1 vertex (the center)\n Step 1: add k vertices -> total = 1 + k\n Step 2: for each of the k leaves, we add k new vertices. So we add k*k = k^2 vertices -> total = 1 + k + k^2\n Step 3: then for each of the k^2 leaves (from step 2) we would add k new vertices? But note: the problem says \"each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (i.e., leaves) must be connected by edges to k more new vertices. And we do this step at least once.\n\n However, note the example: smallest snowflake for k=4 is shown. Let's draw:\n\n  Step 0: center (degree 0)\n  Step 1: attach 4 nodes -> center has degree 4, and each of these 4 has degree 1.\n  Step 2: then we must expand the 4 leaves (each leaf becomes a node with 4 new connections). But wait, if we do that, the center has 4 edges, and then each of the 4 branches has 4 nodes (so 4*4=16) and then the leaves of the second layer are 16. Then total vertices = 1 + 4 + 16 = 21.\n\n But the example says the smallest snowflake for k=4. The problem says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\" So we do the expansion at least once, meaning we do the initial expansion (step 1) and then step 2. So the minimal snowflake is built from two expansions.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that we stop after two steps. We can have multiple layers. But the process is:\n\n  Layer 0: 1 vertex\n  Layer 1: k vertices (attached to the center)\n  Layer 2: k * k vertices (each leaf from layer1 gives k new ones)\n  Layer 3: k * k * k vertices? \n\n But wait, after layer 2, the leaves from layer 2 are the ones we would expand. However, the problem states that we do the expansion at least once (meaning we must have at least two layers: center and one layer of k). Then we can have any number of layers (each leaf expansion).\n\n Therefore, the total number of vertices is:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... + k^m   (for some m>=1)\n\n But note: the expansion is done at least once, so m>=1 (meaning we have at least two layers: center and one ring). However, we can have more than two layers.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the snowflake as having a center and then a tree structure. Each leaf in the previous layer is expanded to k children.\n\n However, note: the initial expansion is from the center (which is not a leaf initially? Actually, the center is connected to k nodes so it has degree k. Then the k nodes are leaves. Then we expand the leaves (each leaf becomes a node of degree k+1, because it was connected to the center and then we connect k new ones). Then the k^2 nodes from the second expansion become leaves.\n\n So the formula is:\n\n   n = 1 + k * (1 + k * (1 + k * ... ))   [with at least one expansion beyond the center]\n\n Actually, we can write:\n\n   n = 1 + k * (1 + k * (1 + ...))   [m times, m>=1]\n\n This is a geometric series:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... + k^m   for some m>=1.\n\n But note: the expansion is done at least once, so we have at least two layers (center and one ring). The series then goes from exponent 0 (the center) to exponent m (with m>=1). So:\n\n   n = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1)   [if we consider m+1 terms, from exponent 0 to m]\n\n However, note: our series has terms from exponent 0 to m, which is m+1 terms. But the process: \n   After the first expansion (m=0): we have 1 + k = (k^1 - 1) / (k-1) + 1? Actually, no.\n\n Let me define:\n\n   Let m be the number of expansions (steps) we do, including the initial expansion (which is the first step). But the problem says \"at least once\", meaning m>=1.\n\n   Then the total number of vertices is:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\n        = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\n But note: the initial vertex is the center (exponent 0), then the first expansion adds k (exponent 1), then the second adds k^2 (exponent 2), etc.\n\n Example: k=4, m=1: n = (4^2 - 1)/(4-1) = (16-1)/3 = 15/3 = 5. But wait, the minimal snowflake for k=4 should be 1 (center) + 4 (first ring) = 5. Then the example says the smallest for k=4 is shown (probably 5 is the minimal). However, the example output includes 15 as YES, 255 as YES, and 10101 as YES, but 5 is also YES? But wait, the example input includes 6 and 13 and 15.\n\n But note: the example input:\n\n      Input: 9 test cases: [1,2,3,6,13,15,255,10101,1000000000000000000]\n\n      Output: ['NO','NO','NO','NO','YES','YES','YES','YES','NO']\n\n So 15 is YES, 13 is YES, 255 is YES, 10101 is YES.\n\n However, 5 (which is 1+k) would be YES. But 5 is not in the example input.\n\n But wait: the example input does not include 5. The problem says: \"Output 'YES' if there exists such k>1 that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; 'NO' otherwise.\"\n\n So we are to check for a given n (which can be as large as 10^18) whether there exists an integer k>1 and an integer m>=1 such that:\n\n        n = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\n However, note: the above formula is for a geometric series with m+1 terms (from exponent 0 to m). But the process requires at least one expansion (so m>=1). \n\n Alternatively, note that the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion step (from leaves) is done at least once. The first expansion is the center to k, and then the expansion step is done at least once (so we must have at least two layers). \n\n But wait: the problem says:\n\n   Step 1: initial vertex connected to k new -> then we have the center and k leaves (so one expansion).\n   Step 2: then each leaf (which are k leaves) is expanded to k new -> then we have the second ring.\n\n The problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion step (step 2) is done at least once. So the minimal snowflake has two rings: center and two rings? Or wait, the initial expansion (step 1) is mandatory, and then the expansion step (step 2) must be done at least once? \n\n Actually, reading the problem statement:\n\n   \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\"\n\n   Then: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n So the initial expansion (step 1) is the first part, and then the expansion step (step 2) must be done at least once. Therefore, the minimal snowflake has two expansions: the center expansion and one expansion of the leaves.\n\n Therefore, the minimal number of layers is 2 (center and one ring of k, and then the leaves of the first ring are expanded to form the second ring). Then the total vertices is:\n\n        n_min = 1 + k + k^2\n\n But wait, that doesn't match the example: for k=4, the minimal snowflake is 1+4+16=21? However, the example says the smallest for k=4 is shown (but without giving the number). Also, the example output includes 15 (which is 1+k+k^2 for k=3? because 1+3+9=13, wait 15 is 1+2+4+8? Actually, 15 can be represented as:\n\n        n = (2^4 - 1) / (2-1) = 15, but wait: 2^4-1=15, so m+1=4 -> m=3 (three expansions). \n\n But note: the formula for the geometric series:\n\n        n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n For k=2, m=3: (2^4-1)/(2-1)=15.\n\n However, the problem requires at least one expansion (the step of expanding leaves) to be done at least once. In the case of k=2, the minimal snowflake would be with m=1 (one expansion of leaves) and then the total vertices would be (2^2-1)/(2-1)=3. But 3 is not allowed because the initial expansion is fixed and then we must do at least one expansion of leaves? Actually, the initial expansion (step 1) is mandatory and then the expansion step (step 2) must be done at least once.\n\n But note: the initial expansion (step 1) is the center to k. Then the expansion step (step 2) is applied to the leaves (which are k in number). So the minimal configuration is two expansions (step1 and step2). \n\n However, wait: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\". The \"step\" referred to here is the step of expanding leaves. So we must do at least one expansion of leaves. Therefore, the minimal configuration is:\n\n        n_min = 1 + k + k^2   (because we do the center expansion (k) and then the expansion of the k leaves (k*k))\n\n But then why is 15 (which is 1+2+4+8) acceptable? That would be:\n\n        n = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 = 15.\n\n But note: the expansion of leaves must be done at least once. In this case, we did the center expansion (k=2) and then we expanded the leaves (the two leaves from the first ring) to two new leaves each, so we get two layers of expansion (the first expansion and then the second expansion). Then we could also do a third expansion? The problem does not specify that we cannot do more than once. It only says \"at least once\".\n\n However, the problem does not fix the number of expansions. So we can have any number of layers (m>=1, meaning the expansion step is done at least once, so m>=1). But wait, note: the expansion step is done at least once. The initial expansion is fixed (step1) and then we do at least one expansion step (step2). So the minimal number of layers is two (center and two rings). However, the example 15 is achieved by three layers (center, first ring, second ring, third ring). \n\n But wait, the definition:\n\n        Step 0: center (vertex count=1)\n        Step 1: attach k -> vertex count=1+k\n        Step 2: expand the k leaves (each leaf becomes a node with k children) -> vertex count=1+k+k*k\n\n        Step 3: expand the k*k leaves -> vertex count=1+k+k*k+k*k*k\n\n So the general term is:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m   (where m>=1, because we do at least the step1 and step2, so m>=2? Actually, the center is layer0, step1 (layer1) and step2 (layer2) so m=2 is the minimal. But wait, the expansion step is done at least once, so we must do step2 (which is the first expansion of leaves) at least once. So the minimal configuration is:\n\n            n_min = 1 + k + k^2   (m=2, because we have exponents 0,1,2)\n\n However, then how did we get 15? 15 = 1+2+4+8, which is m=3 (exponents 0 to 3). \n\n Alternatively, we can interpret the problem differently: the problem says the initial expansion (step1) is mandatory and then the expansion step (step2) is done at least once. But note: the expansion step is defined as: \"each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (leaves) is expanded. After step1, we have k leaves. Then we expand each leaf (step2) and then we get k^2 leaves. Then we can expand again (step3) and so on.\n\n But the condition is that the expansion step is done at least once. So we must do at least step2. However, we are allowed to do more.\n\n So the minimal snowflake has at least two layers (center and two rings). Then the minimal n is 1+k+k^2.\n\n But wait, the example input includes 13 and 15. \n\n        n=13: \n          Is there a k>1 and an integer m>=1 (actually, the minimal m is 2) such that 13 = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)?\n\n        Let's try:\n\n          For k=3: 1+3+9 = 13 -> m=2 (so m+1=3, so (3^3-1)/2 = (27-1)/2=13 -> yes.\n\n        n=15:\n          k=2: 1+2+4+8=15 -> m=3 (so (2^4-1)/1=15) -> yes.\n\n        n=255: \n          255 = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) for some k>1 and m>=2.\n\n          Let me check: 255 is 2^8-1, so (k=2, m+1=8 -> m=7) -> then (2^8-1)/(2-1)=255 -> yes.\n\n        n=10101:\n          We need to check if 10101 can be written as (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) for some k>1 and m>=2.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require that the entire snowflake is built by the same k? Actually, the problem defines the snowflake with a fixed k. So k must be the same throughout.\n\n However, the problem does not say we can change k. So k is fixed for the entire snowflake.\n\n Therefore, the problem reduces to:\n\n        Given n (from 1 to 10^18), determine if there exists an integer k>1 and an integer m>=1 (note: actually, the minimal m is 1? or 2?) such that:\n\n          n = (k^(m+1)-1) / (k-1)\n\n But note: the expansion step is done at least once, so we must have at least two layers (center and two rings). Therefore, m (the exponent) must be at least 2 (since the minimal configuration has two expansions: step1 and step2, which gives exponents 0,1,2 -> so m=2). However, wait: in the formula, the number of terms is m+1, and the highest exponent is m. The minimal m is 2 (so m+1=3, meaning we have three terms: k^0, k^1, k^2).\n\n But wait, let's reexamine the process:\n\n        Step0: center (vertex count=1) -> k=?\n        Step1: add k vertices -> total=1+k\n        Step2: expand the k leaves (each becomes k children) -> total=1+k+k^2\n\n        Then, if we do step3, we add k^3, etc.\n\n        So the minimal configuration (minimal expansion) is step0, step1, step2. Then the total vertices is 1+k+k^2.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\" (referring to the expansion step, i.e., step2). So we must have step2. Therefore, the minimal configuration is 1+k+k^2.\n\n        However, the example 15 is built by k=2 and m=3 (so 1+2+4+8). But note: the expansion step (step2) is done once (to get the second ring) and then we can do it again (third ring). So the condition is that we do at least one expansion step (step2) and then we can do more.\n\n        Therefore, the equation is:\n\n          n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)   for some integer k>1 and integer m>=2.\n\n        But wait, what if we do only one expansion step (m=2)? Then n = (k^3-1)/(k-1) = k^2+k+1.\n\n        What if we do two expansion steps (m=3)? Then n = (k^4-1)/(k-1) = 1+k+k^2+k^3.\n\n        So the exponents m (in the geometric series) must be at least 2 (because m is the highest exponent, and we have at least two expansions: step1 and step2, so the highest exponent is 2).\n\n        But note: the problem says the expansion step (step2) is done at least once. The initial expansion (step1) is mandatory. Then the expansion step (step2) is done at least once. Then the total layers is at least 3 (center, step1, step2). The total vertices is then:\n\n            n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m   for m>=2.\n\n        However, note: the expansion step is defined as: \"each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (leaves). After step1, we have k leaves. Then we do step2: we expand each leaf, so we add k*k = k^2. Then we have k^2 leaves (from step2). Then if we do step3, we expand each of these leaves, adding k^3, etc.\n\n        So the minimal m is 2 (because we have two expansions: step1 and step2). Then the minimal n is 1+k+k^2.\n\n        But wait: the problem says the expansion step is done at least once, meaning step2 is done at least once. So we must have at least two layers (center, layer1, layer2). Therefore, the minimal n is 1+k+k^2.\n\n        However, note that the example input includes 13 (which is 1+3+9) and 15 (which is 1+2+4+8). So 15 is not minimal (it has four layers) but still valid.\n\n        Therefore, we are to check if n can be expressed as:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m   for some integers k>1 and m>=2.\n\n        But note: we can also have the minimal configuration (m=2) and any higher m.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not require the minimal configuration. Any configuration (with m>=2) is acceptable.\n\n        How to check for n up to 10^18?\n\n        Since n can be very large, we cannot iterate over all possible k and m.\n\n        Alternative approach:\n\n        Note: the equation is:\n\n          n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n        We can fix k and solve for m, but k can be as large as n (if m=1, then n=k+1, but we require m>=2, so k^2 <= n). Actually, k must be at least 2, and the minimal n is 1+2+4=7. So for n<7, we can immediately say NO.\n\n        Let's list small n:\n\n          n=1: minimal configuration requires at least 7 -> NO.\n          n=2: NO.\n          n=3: minimal configuration requires at least 7 -> NO.\n          n=4: NO.\n          n=5: NO.\n          n=6: NO.\n          n=7: 1+2+4=7 -> YES (k=2, m=2)\n\n        But wait, the example output:\n\n          Input: 1 -> NO\n                 2 -> NO\n                 3 -> NO\n                 6 -> NO\n                 13 -> YES\n                 15 -> YES\n                 255 -> YES\n                 10101 -> YES\n                 1000000000000000000 -> NO\n\n        So for n=7, we would output YES. But 7 is not in the example. However, the example input starts from 1,2,3,6,13,...\n\n        How to check for a given n?\n\n        Observation:\n\n          We can also have m=2: then n = 1+k+k^2. For k>1, k is an integer. Then we can solve for k: \n\n            k^2 + k + (1-n) = 0\n\n            discriminant = 1 - 4*(1-n) = 4*n - 3\n\n            Then k = (-1 + sqrt(4*n-3)) / 2.\n\n            We require that 4*n-3 is a perfect square and that the resulting k is an integer greater than 1.\n\n          Similarly, for m>=3, we can fix k and then check if (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) = n.\n\n        But note: n can be very large (up to 10^18). We cannot iterate over k from 2 to n.\n\n        Alternate Insight:\n\n          The equation for fixed k and varying m is a geometric series. However, note that for a fixed k, the sequence of n's is:\n\n            m=2: n0 = 1+k+k^2\n            m=3: n1 = 1+k+k^2+k^3\n            ...\n\n          And note that k must be at least 2.\n\n        How about iterating over k? \n\n          Since k>=2, and n>=7 (minimal n for k=2 is 7). Then k must satisfy k^2 <= n (because even the minimal configuration for k requires k^2 <= n). Actually, for m>=2, we have:\n\n            n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m >= 1+k+k^2\n\n            => k^2 <= n-1\n\n            => k <= sqrt(n-1)\n\n          So k is at most around sqrt(n). For n=10^18, sqrt(n)=10^9, which is too many to iterate.\n\n        Another idea: we can consider the base-k representation. But note: n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) is the number with m+1 ones in base k.\n\n        However, we can also consider: for a given n, the possible bases k might be small because the minimal representation is with m=2: then n = 1+k+k^2. \n\n        But note: we can also have m>=3. However, the minimal k for a given n is at least 2.\n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the equation for m=2 (the minimal configuration) is easy: check if there exists an integer k>=2 such that 1+k+k^2 = n.\n\n        Then, for m>=3: we have n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) for some k>=2 and m>=3.\n\n        But note: the same n might be represented in two different ways (different k and m). \n\n        However, we can try to find k for m=2, and then for m>=3, we can factorize n? Not straightforward.\n\n        Let me think: we can also consider the following:\n\n          For a fixed m (number of expansions, so m>=2), we want to know if there exists an integer k>1 such that:\n\n            (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) = n\n\n          This is equivalent to:\n\n            k^(m+1) - 1 = n*(k-1)\n\n            => k^(m+1) - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n        But solving for k for each m is difficult because m can be up to ? (the exponent) and k is integer.\n\n        However, note that k must be at least 2 and m is at least 2. Also, the total number of expansions m is limited by the fact that k^m <= n (because n is at least 1+k+...+k^m, and k^m is the largest term). \n\n        But we can also consider: for a fixed m, we can solve for k by binary search? But m is variable.\n\n        Another idea: iterate over m (the number of expansions, which is the exponent, so m>=2). The maximum m is about log_k(n). Since k>=2, the maximum m is about log2(n). For n=10^18, log2(10^18) is about 60. So we can iterate m from 2 to 60 (or a bit more).\n\n        Steps:\n\n          For a given n, we try:\n\n          Case 1: Check if n is representable with m=2 (the minimal configuration). Then we need to check if there exists integer k>=2 such that 1+k+k^2 = n.\n\n          Case 2: For m from 3 to about 60 (or while 2^m < n):\n\n            We have: n = (k^m - 1)/(k-1)   [wait, no: the formula is (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) for the entire series. Actually, note:\n\n                For m expansions (so the highest exponent is m), we have:\n\n                    n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n            So we are looking for an integer k>=2 and integer m>=3 such that:\n\n                    (k^(m+1)-1) = n*(k-1)\n\n            Rearranged:\n\n                    k^(m+1) = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n            We can solve for k: \n\n                For fixed m, we can try to find an integer k>=2 such that k^(m+1) = n*(k-1)+1.\n\n            But note: k^(m+1) must be greater than n*(k-1). \n\n            Alternatively, we can iterate k from 2 to floor(pow(n, 1/(m+1))) + 1, but that floor might be too big.\n\n        However, note: the equation is:\n\n            k^(m+1) = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n        For a fixed m, we can compute:\n\n            k^(m+1) - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n        But solving this equation for k is non-trivial.\n\n        Alternate Insight:\n\n          Notice that the equation for a fixed m (say m=2) is quadratic, for m=3 is cubic, etc. We can use binary search for k for a fixed m, but the range of k is from 2 to ...? \n\n          Since k^(m+1) = n*(k-1)+1, then k^(m+1) is roughly n*k. So k^m is roughly n. Therefore, k is about n^(1/m). Since m>=3, then k is at most about n^(1/3) (for m=3) which is 10^6 for n=10^18, which is too many to iterate.\n\n        We need a better approach.\n\n        Let me consider: the equation for a fixed m (say m=2) is:\n\n            k^2 + k + 1 = n\n\n            => k^2 + k + (1-n) = 0\n\n            Then k = [-1 ± sqrt(1-4*(1-n))]/2 = [-1 ± sqrt(4*n-3)]/2\n\n            We require sqrt(4*n-3) to be an integer, and then k must be positive and integer.\n\n        Similarly, for m=3:\n\n            n = 1+k+k^2+k^3\n\n            => k^3+k^2+k+1-n=0\n\n            This is a cubic equation. We can try to find an integer root k by testing divisors? But note: k must be at least 2 and the value of k is the base. However, we can also use binary search for k for a fixed m (from 2 to about 60). \n\n        However, note: the total number of test cases t can be up to 10000. So we cannot iterate over m from 2 to 60 for each test case (because 10000 * 60 = 600000, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python we must be careful). But for each m, we are going to do a binary search for k? \n\n        But note: for each test case, we have one n (from 1 to 10^18). We want to check for some m (from 2 to about 60) and then for each m, we need to check if there exists an integer k>=2 such that:\n\n            k^(m+1) = n*(k-1)+1\n\n        However, note: the left side is k^(m+1) and the right side is n*(k-1)+1. For k=2, the left side grows exponentially. So we can iterate m from 2 to 60 (for each test case) and then for each m, we can solve for k by checking if there exists an integer k such that k^(m+1) = n*(k-1)+1.\n\n        But note: k^(m+1) is a very large number. We cannot compute k^(m+1) directly for k=10^9 and m=60? \n\n        Actually, we can rearrange:\n\n            k^(m+1) - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n        But note: we can express k in terms of n and m. However, we can also bound k:\n\n            k^(m+1) = n*(k-1)+1\n\n            => k^(m+1) <= n*k   (because k>=2, then n*(k-1)+1 <= n*k)\n\n            => k^m <= n\n\n            So k <= n**(1/m)\n\n        For m>=2, the maximum k is about n**(1/m). For n=10^18, m=2: k <= sqrt(10^18)=10^9, which is too many to iterate.\n\n        But note: we are iterating m from 2 to 60, and for each m, we are going to iterate k from 2 to n**(1/m). The total iteration count would be:\n\n            For m=2: k from 2 to 10^9 -> too many.\n\n        We need to avoid iterating over k.\n\n        Alternative for fixed m: we can use binary search for k in the range [2, n**(1/m)] (but note: k must be integer). However, the function f(k)=k^(m+1) grows very fast, and the equation is:\n\n            k^(m+1) = n*(k-1)+1\n\n        We can do binary search for k for a fixed m.\n\n        Steps for fixed m and n:\n\n          low = 2\n          high = floor(n**(1/m)) + 100   (we set an upper bound: k^m <= n, so k <= n**(1/m))\n\n          Then, while low <= high:\n            mid = (low+high)//2\n            left = mid**(m+1)\n            right = n*(mid-1)+1\n\n            Compare left and right.\n\n            If left == right: then we found k=mid, so return True.\n\n            If left < right: then we need a larger k (because left grows faster) -> so set low = mid+1.\n\n            If left > right: then set high = mid-1.\n\n        But note: the function f(k)=k^(m+1) is increasing, and g(k)=n*(k-1)+1 is linear. So we can do this.\n\n        However, the exponent m+1 can be up to 61 (if m=60) and k can be up to 10^18**(1/60) which is about 10^(18/60)=10^0.3 ~ 2 (for m=60, k is at most 2). So for large m, the range of k is very small.\n\n        But for small m, the range of k is large (like m=2, k up to 10^9). However, we cannot do a binary search for m=2 over 10^9 possibilities? Actually, binary search will take about log2(10^9)=30 iterations per m. And we do that for each test case and for each m from 2 to 60. Then for one test case, we do 60 * 30 = 1800 iterations, which is acceptable for 10000 test cases? 10000 * 1800 = 18e6, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python we must be cautious.\n\n        However, note: n can be as large as 10^18, and the computation of mid**(m+1) for m=2 and mid=10^9 is 10^9**3 = 10^27, which is a big number and might be slow in Python. But we are doing at most 1800 such computations per test case? Actually, we are doing 60 (m) * 30 (binary search steps) = 1800 per test case. Then for 10000 test cases, we do 1800 * 10000 = 18e6 evaluations. But each evaluation is a big exponentiation (with numbers up to 10^9 raised to the power 3 for m=2, and for m=60, the base is at most 2). \n\n        But wait, for m=2, the base k is up to 10^9 and exponent 3, so we are computing (10^9)^3 = 10^27, which is a very big number and might be slow. However, we can compare without computing the full number? Or we can use logarithms? But we need exact integer equality.\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid the big exponentiation by using:\n\n            Condition: k^(m+1) == n*(k-1)+1\n\n        But we cannot avoid the exponentiation for the left side.\n\n        However, note that for large k, the left side is huge. But in the binary search, we are only going to do about 30 steps per m, and the k values we test are the midpoints. But the midpoint for m=2 and n=10^18 is in the range [2, 10^9]. The midpoint is 5e8, then (5e8)^3 = 125e24, which is 1.25e26, which is a big integer but Python can handle. But we have 18e6 such big integer computations, which might be slow.\n\n       ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting with a central vertex, followed by layers of vertices each connected to the previous layer's vertices. The key insight is that the total number of vertices in such a graph must satisfy a specific geometric series condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The snowflake graph is built by starting with a central vertex (layer 0). Each subsequent layer \\( i \\) (for \\( i \\geq 1 \\)) consists of \\( k^{i} \\) vertices, where \\( k > 1 \\) is a fixed integer. The total number of vertices after \\( m \\) layers (including the central vertex) is given by the geometric series sum:\n   \\[\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^m = \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( m \\geq 1 \\) ensures at least one expansion beyond the initial central vertex.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For a given \\( n \\), we need to check if there exists an integer \\( k > 1 \\) and an integer \\( m \\geq 1 \\) such that the above equation holds. Given the constraints \\( n \\leq 10^{18} \\), we cannot iterate over all possible \\( k \\) and \\( m \\) directly. Instead, we use binary search for each possible \\( m \\) (from 2 to a reasonable upper limit, say 60) to find if there exists a \\( k \\) satisfying the equation.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each test case:\n   - Check if \\( n \\) can be expressed as \\( \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\) for some \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( m \\geq 2 \\).\n   - Use binary search for each \\( m \\) to find \\( k \\) efficiently. The binary search bounds are derived from \\( k^m \\leq n \\), ensuring \\( k \\) is within feasible limits.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: For each test case, we perform up to 60 binary searches (one for each \\( m \\)), each requiring about 60 steps (logarithmic in \\( n \\)). With \\( t \\leq 10^4 \\) test cases, the total operations are around \\( 10^4 \\times 60 \\times 60 = 36 \\times 10^6 \\), which is manageable for modern programming languages.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_power(x, exponent):\n    if x < 0:\n        return False\n    root = round(x**(1/exponent))\n    if root < 2:\n        return False\n    return root**exponent == x\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    answers = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n_val = int(data[index]); index += 1\n        \n        if n_val <= 6:\n            answers.append(\"NO\")\n            continue\n            \n        found = False\n        for m in range(2, 61):\n            low = 2\n            high = 10**18\n            candidate_k = None\n            while low <= high:\n                mid = (low + high) // 2\n                left_side = pow(mid, m+1)\n                right_side = n_val * (mid - 1) + 1\n                \n                if left_side == right_side:\n                    candidate_k = mid\n                    break\n                elif left_side < right_side:\n                    low = mid + 1\n                else:\n                    high = mid - 1\n                    \n            if candidate_k is not None:\n                found = True\n                break\n                \n        if found:\n            answers.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            answers.append(\"NO\")\n            \n    print(\"\\n\".join(answers))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Initial Check**: For small values of \\( n \\) (up to 6), the answer is immediately \"NO\" since the minimal snowflake requires at least 7 vertices.\n3. **Binary Search for Valid \\( k \\)**: For each possible number of layers \\( m \\) (from 2 to 60), the code performs a binary search to find an integer \\( k > 1 \\) such that the geometric series sum equals \\( n \\).
