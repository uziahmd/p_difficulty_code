    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering that removing one element might help us avoid either the minimum or the maximum (or both) of the entire array.\n\n Observation:\n The instability of the array is defined as max - min.\n After removing one element, the new array's instability will be (max of remaining) - (min of remaining).\n\n We note that if we remove an element that is not the current min or max, then the min and max of the entire array remain unchanged, so the instability remains the same.\n\n Therefore, the only candidates for removal are:\n   - The global minimum\n   - The global maximum\n\n However, note that there might be multiple occurrences. But if we remove one occurrence, then:\n\n Case 1: Remove one occurrence of the minimum.\n   Then the new min might be the next smallest value (if there was more than one minimum) or it might be the old min if we don't remove all minimums? Actually, we remove exactly one. So if there are multiple minima, then the new min is the same as the old min (because at least one minimum remains). Similarly, if we remove one occurrence of the maximum, the new max is the same as the old max if there are multiple maxima.\n\n But wait: we can also consider removing an element that is neither the min nor the max? However, if we remove an element that is neither, then the min and max of the entire array remain the same, so the instability doesn't change. Therefore, the best improvement must come from removing either the min or the max.\n\n However, let's think again: what if we have an array [1, 2, 3, 4]?\n   Original: min=1, max=4, instability=3.\n   Removing 1: [2,3,4] -> instability=2\n   Removing 4: [1,2,3] -> instability=2\n   Removing any other? say 2: [1,3,4] -> instability=3; same for 3.\n\n But consider [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]:\n   Original: min=1, max=4, instability=3.\n   Removing one 1: [1,2,3,4] -> min=1, max=4, instability=3 -> same.\n   So in this case, removing one 1 doesn't help because there's still a 1.\n\n Therefore, we must consider the possibility that the array has duplicates.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let the original array be `a`.\n Sort the array.\n\n Then, the instability of the entire array is a[-1] - a[0].\n\n Now, if we remove one element, we can remove one element from the sorted array and then the new instability is the difference between the new max and new min.\n\n The new array will be:\n   Without the first element: [a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] -> new_min = a[1], new_max = a[-1] -> instability = a[-1] - a[1]\n   Without the last element: [a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-2]] -> new_min = a[0], new_max = a[-2] -> instability = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n But what about removing an element from the middle? Then the min and max remain the same as the original, unless the removed element was the min or max.\n\n However, note: if we remove an element that is not the first or last in the sorted array, then the first and last elements remain. Therefore, the min and max are unchanged, so the instability is the same as the original.\n\n So the candidate removals are only the ones that change the min or max.\n\n But wait: what if we remove an element that is the only min or the only max?\n\n Example: [1,2,3,4] -> removing 1: instability becomes 4-2=2, removing 4: instability becomes 3-1=2.\n\n Another example: [1,2,3,100] -> \n   Removing 1: [2,3,100] -> instability=98\n   Removing 100: [1,2,3] -> instability=2\n   Removing 2: [1,3,100] -> instability=99\n   Removing 3: [1,2,100] -> instability=99\n\n So the best is to remove the maximum.\n\n How do we generalize?\n\n We can consider two cases:\n   Case 1: Remove the smallest element (which may appear multiple times, but if we remove one occurrence, then the new smallest is the next smallest, which is the same as the original smallest if there's duplicate, but if there's no duplicate then it becomes the next one).\n   Case 2: Remove the largest element.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to remove any one element. The key is that if we remove an element that is not the unique minimum or unique maximum, then the min and max might not change. But sometimes, even if we remove an element that is not the extreme, we might get a better instability? \n\n Wait: actually, the instability is determined by the entire set of remaining numbers. The min and max of the entire set are the only factors. \n\n But note: if we remove an element that is the current min, then the new min is the smallest number that remains (which is the next smallest, i.e., the second smallest if the min was unique, or still the min if there were duplicates). Similarly for the max.\n\n Therefore, the two possibilities we must consider are:\n\n Possibility 1: Remove the smallest element (so the new min is the next smallest, and the max remains the same). Then the instability is (max - new_min) = a[-1] - a[1] (if we remove the first element, but wait: what if we remove the smallest element but it's not the first one? Actually, the array is sorted so the smallest is the first. But note: the smallest element might appear multiple times, so we cannot simply look at a[1] because if the smallest appears multiple times, then after removal, the smallest is still a[0] (if we remove one occurrence of a[0] and there is another a[0])? \n\n Actually, we have to consider the entire set.\n\n Let's sort the array. Then, the array is in increasing order.\n\n Then, the two scenarios:\n\n Scenario A: Remove one occurrence of the smallest element (which is at index0). Then the new array's minimum is the smallest element that is left. If there are multiple smallest elements (duplicates), then the new minimum is still the smallest element (because at least one remains). So:\n\n   If the smallest element is repeated (i.e., there is at least two), then removing one smallest doesn't change the min. But then the max remains the same? Not necessarily: if we remove the smallest, the max remains the same only if we didn't remove the max? Actually, no: the max is independent. But wait, the max is the last element. So if we remove the smallest, the max remains the same.\n\n   Therefore, after removing one smallest, the new instability is: max_original - (the next smallest value, which is the smallest if there are duplicates, or the next distinct value if not).\n\n   Actually, the next smallest value is the minimum of the remaining array. Since we removed one occurrence, if there is another smallest, then the min remains the same. So:\n\n   Let the sorted array be `b`. Then:\n\n   Option 1: Remove the first element (which is the smallest). Then the new array starts at `b[1]` if we removed the first, but wait: we are allowed to remove any element. However, the smallest element might appear in the middle? No, because we sorted. The smallest element is at the beginning.\n\n   Actually, we can consider:\n\n   Candidate 1: Remove the smallest element (which is b[0]). Then the new min is:\n        If there exists at least two b[0] (i.e., b[0] == b[1]), then the new min is still b[0]. Otherwise, the new min is b[1].\n\n   But wait, we don't know how many duplicates. Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n   We can compute two candidate removals:\n\n   Candidate 1: Remove the smallest element (any one occurrence of the smallest). Then the new min is the next smallest distinct value? Actually, no: the new min is the smallest value in the remaining array, which is the smallest value that is >= b[0] (and since we removed one b[0], the new min is the smallest value that remains). \n\n   Actually, the min of the remaining array is the minimum value that is not removed. So:\n\n   Option 1: Remove one occurrence of the smallest value. Then the new min is:\n        If there are multiple smallest values, then the smallest value is still present, so the min remains b[0].\n        Otherwise, the min becomes b[1].\n\n   Similarly, for the maximum: if we remove one occurrence of the maximum, the new max is:\n        If there are multiple maximums, then the max remains b[-1] (since there's still one left).\n        Otherwise, the max becomes b[-2].\n\n   Then the instability for Option 1 (removing smallest) is:\n        If duplicates for smallest: instability = b[-1] - b[0]   (same as original)\n        Else: instability = b[-1] - b[1]\n\n   Similarly, for Option 2 (removing largest) is:\n        If duplicates for largest: instability = b[-1] - b[0]   (same as original)\n        Else: instability = b[-2] - b[0]\n\n   However, wait: if we remove the smallest and there are duplicates, then the min remains the same, but the max remains the same too, so instability remains the same. Similarly for the maximum.\n\n   But note: we are allowed to remove only one element. And we are trying to minimize the instability.\n\n   However, there is a catch: maybe we can remove an element that is not the smallest or largest, but that is causing the instability? Actually, no. Because the instability is determined by the overall min and max.\n\n   Therefore, the two candidates are:\n\n      candidate1 = \n          if the smallest appears only once: then instability = b[-1] - b[1]\n          else: instability = b[-1] - b[0]   [because min doesn't change]\n\n      candidate2 =\n          if the largest appears only once: then instability = b[-2] - b[0]\n          else: instability = b[-1] - b[0]   [because max doesn't change]\n\n   Then the answer is the minimum of these two candidates? \n\n   But wait, what if we remove an element that is not the smallest and not the largest? Then the min and max remain the same, so instability = b[-1]-b[0]. This candidate is worse than at least one of candidate1 or candidate2 (unless candidate1 and candidate2 are the same and already the original instability, then removing a non-extreme might not help). \n\n   Actually, we are only concerned with minimizing the instability. So we must consider that removing a non-extreme might leave the instability unchanged, but we are looking for the minimum possible.\n\n   However, we have two candidates from removing the smallest and the largest. But note: there might be a third candidate? \n\n   Consider: [1,2,3,100] (sorted: [1,2,3,100])\n     Removing smallest: [2,3,100] -> instability=98\n     Removing largest: [1,2,3] -> instability=2\n\n   So the answer is 2.\n\n   Now, what if we remove an element that is the smallest and the largest? But we can only remove one.\n\n   What if the array has only two elements? [1,2]: \n        Removing 1: [2] -> instability=0\n        Removing 2: [1] -> instability=0\n\n   But according to our method:\n        sorted: [1,2]\n        candidate1: smallest appears once -> candidate1 = 2 - 1 = 1? -> wait, no: if we remove the smallest, then the array becomes [2] -> min=2, max=2 -> instability=0.\n\n   Correction: In our candidate calculation for candidate1, we assumed that if we remove the smallest, then the new min is the next smallest (if exists) or if there are duplicates then the same. But in [1,2], when we remove the smallest, the next smallest is the next element (which is the only other element) but note: the array becomes of size 1. We have to account for the fact that after removal, the array might have only one element.\n\n   However, the problem says: remove exactly one element from the array (which has n>=2) and then we have an array of n-1 elements (which is at least 1). The instability of an array of one element is 0.\n\n   Therefore, we must consider that if we remove the smallest, then the new array is the entire array without the smallest. Then the min and max of the new array are the min and max of the remaining set.\n\n   Actually, we can compute the instability after removal by:\n\n      After removing an element x, the instability is max(remaining) - min(remaining)\n\n   We can precompute:\n\n      candidate_remove_first = (b[-1] - b[1]) if n > 2 else 0   # But wait, if n==2, then removing the first leaves one element -> 0.\n      However, we have to consider that if we remove the first element, then the array has n-1 elements. The min is the next element (if any) and the max is the last element.\n\n   Actually, we can write:\n\n      candidate1 = b[-1] - (b[1] if n-1 > 1 else b[0])   -> This is incorrect.\n\n   Let me reframe: We have sorted array b of length n.\n\n   Option 1: Remove the smallest element (which is b[0]).\n        Then the new array is b[1:] (if we remove the first element). Then the min is b[1] and the max is b[-1] (if n>=2, then b[1] exists). But wait, if n==2, then b[1:] is [b[1]], so min and max are b[1]. Then instability = b[1]-b[1]=0.\n\n   Similarly, Option 2: Remove the largest element (which is b[-1]).\n        Then the new array is b[:-1]. Then the min is b[0] and the max is b[-2] (if n>=2, then b[-2] exists). For n==2, then b[:-1] is [b[0]], so instability=0.\n\n   But wait, what if we remove an element that is the smallest but there are duplicates? Then the new array still has the smallest, so the min is still b[0]. Then the instability is b[-1] - b[0] (same as original). But note: we are only removing one occurrence. So:\n\n   Actually, we don't need to worry about duplicates separately because:\n\n        Removing one occurrence of the smallest (whether duplicated or not) leaves the smallest value in the array as the next smallest value that is >= b[0]. \n\n        However, if there are duplicates, then the smallest value remains b[0]. But the array after removal is still having the same min (if duplicates) and same max.\n\n        So we can compute:\n\n        candidate_remove_min = \n            if we remove one occurrence of the smallest, then the new min is:\n                If there exists at least two smallest (i.e., b[0] == b[1]), then the new min is still b[0].\n                Otherwise, the new min is b[1] (because we removed the only occurrence of the smallest).\n\n        Similarly, candidate_remove_max = \n            if there exists at least two maximums (i.e., b[-1] == b[-2]), then the new max is still b[-1].\n            Otherwise, the new max is b[-2].\n\n        Then, the instability after removing the smallest is: \n            candidate_remove_min_instability = b[-1] - (b[0] if b[0]==b[1] else b[1])\n\n        Similarly, candidate_remove_max_instability = (b[-1] if b[-1]==b[-2] else b[-2]) - b[0]\n\n        But note: what if we remove the smallest and the array has duplicates, then the min doesn't change, but the max remains the same (unless we remove the max too? no, we remove only one). So the instability is the same as original? \n\n        However, wait: we are only removing one element. The max remains the same because we didn't remove the max (unless the smallest was the max, i.e., all elements are equal). \n\n        Example: [1,1,1,1] (all ones). \n            Removing one: \n                candidate_remove_min: min remains 1, max remains 1 -> instability=0.\n                candidate_remove_max: same.\n\n        But note: in this example, the original instability is 0. Removing one element doesn't change that.\n\n        So the candidate_remove_min_instability is computed as above.\n\n   However, there is a simpler way: \n\n        We can consider the entire array and note that the instability after removal is the maximum difference between any two remaining numbers. But the min and max of the entire array might change.\n\n        Actually, the instability is determined by the min and max of the remaining set.\n\n        We can consider two possibilities:\n\n        Possibility 1: The new min is the original min (if we don't remove all occurrences of the min) and the new max is the original max (if we don't remove all occurrences of the max). Then the instability is the original.\n\n        Possibility 2: The new min is increased (if we remove the only occurrence of the min) or the new max is decreased (if we remove the only occurrence of the max).\n\n        But note: we are only removing one element. So:\n\n        Option A: Remove the min. Then the new min is the next smallest value (if the min was unique) or the min itself (if there are duplicates). Similarly for the max.\n\n        Therefore, we can compute:\n\n        candidate1 = b[-1] - (b[0] if (n>1 and b[0] == b[1]) else b[1])   # But wait, if we remove one occurrence of the smallest, then the min might not be b[0] if there was only one occurrence. So:\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n        candidate1 = b[-1] - (b[0] if (count_min > 1) else b[1])\n        candidate2 = (b[-1] if (count_max > 1) else b[-2]) - b[0]\n\n        But wait, we don't know the counts? We can count the frequency of the smallest and largest.\n\n        However, note: we don't need the exact counts, we only need to know if the smallest is duplicated (i.e., if there's at least two of them) and similarly for the largest.\n\n        We can check:\n            is_min_duplicate = (n > 1 and b[0] == b[1])\n            is_max_duplicate = (n > 1 and b[-1] == b[-2])\n\n        Then:\n\n        candidate_remove_min = \n            if is_min_duplicate: then the min remains b[0] -> candidate_remove_min = b[-1] - b[0]\n            else: candidate_remove_min = b[-1] - b[1]\n\n        candidate_remove_max = \n            if is_max_duplicate: then the max remains b[-1] -> candidate_remove_max = b[-1] - b[0]\n            else: candidate_remove_max = b[-2] - b[0]\n\n        Then the answer is the minimum between candidate_remove_min and candidate_remove_max.\n\n        But wait: what if the array has only two elements? Then:\n\n            Example: [1,2] -> \n                sorted: [1,2]\n                is_min_duplicate = (n>1 and b[0]==b[1]) -> 2>1 true, but 1==2 false -> false.\n                candidate_remove_min = 2 - 1 = 1 -> but wait, after removing the smallest, the array becomes [2] -> instability=0.\n\n        Why did we use b[1]? In the formula for candidate_remove_min, we used b[1] only if the min is not duplicated. But in [1,2] the min is not duplicated, so we use b[1] (which is 2) and then subtract from the max (which is 2) -> 0.\n\n        Actually, in the two-element case, when we remove the smallest, the array becomes [b[1]] and the instability is 0.\n\n        Our formula for candidate_remove_min: \n            candidate_remove_min = b[-1] - (b[0] if is_min_duplicate else b[1])\n\n        In [1,2]: candidate_remove_min = 2 - 1? -> no, wait: if not duplicated, we use b[1] as the new min? But wait, when we remove the smallest, the new min is the next smallest, which is b[1] (which is 2). Then the max is still b[-1] (which is 2). So 2-2=0.\n\n        Similarly, for candidate_remove_max: \n            candidate_remove_max = (b[-1] if is_max_duplicate else b[-2]) - b[0]\n            In [1,2]: is_max_duplicate = (n>1 and b[-1]==b[-2]) -> 2>1 true, and 2==1 false -> false. So we use b[-2] which is 1, then subtract b[0] (which is 1) -> 0.\n\n        Then the answer is min(0,0)=0.\n\n        Now, let's test [1,2,3,4]:\n            sorted: [1,2,3,4]\n            is_min_duplicate = (4>1 and 1==2) -> false -> candidate_remove_min = 4-2 = 2.\n            is_max_duplicate = (4>1 and 4==3) -> false -> candidate_remove_max = 3-1 = 2.\n            answer = 2.\n\n        Another example: [1,1,2,3,4] (n=5, sorted)\n            is_min_duplicate = (5>1 and 1==1) -> true -> candidate_remove_min = 4-1 = 3.\n            is_max_duplicate = (5>1 and 4==3) -> false -> candidate_remove_max = 3-1 = 2.\n            answer = 2.\n\n        Another example: [1,1,1,2] (n=4, sorted)\n            is_min_duplicate = (4>1 and 1==1) -> true -> candidate_remove_min = 2-1 = 1.\n            is_max_duplicate = (4>1 and 2==1) -> false -> candidate_remove_max = 1-1 = 0.\n            answer = 0.\n\n        But wait, in [1,1,1,2]:\n            Removing one of the 1's: [1,1,2] -> instability = 2-1=1.\n            Removing the 2: [1,1,1] -> instability = 0.\n\n        So 0 is correct.\n\n        However, what if we remove the smallest and the array has duplicates? Then the min remains the same, but the max remains the same too? Then why did we get 1 in candidate_remove_min? \n\n        Actually, in [1,1,1,2]:\n            candidate_remove_min: since the smallest is duplicated, the min remains 1, and the max remains 2 -> instability = 1.\n\n        That is correct.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to remove any one element. We considered two candidates: removing the smallest and removing the largest. But what if we remove an element that is not the smallest and not the largest? Then the instability remains the same as the original, which is 1. So the minimum is 0 (from removing the largest).\n\n        However, in the example above, we have two candidates: 1 and 0. So we take the minimum.\n\n        But wait: what if we remove an element that is the smallest and the array has duplicates? Then the instability is the same as the original? \n\n        Original: [1,1,1,2] -> instability=2-1=1.\n        After removing one smallest: [1,1,2] -> instability=2-1=1 -> same.\n\n        So our candidate_remove_min is 1, which is the same as the original.\n\n        But we are also considering candidate_remove_max: 0.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is 0.\n\n        Now, what if we have an array with two different extremes? \n\n        Example: [1,2,3,4] -> we get 2.\n\n        Example: [1,3,3,7] (as in the example input) -> \n            sorted: [1,3,3,7]\n            is_min_duplicate = (4>1 and 1==3) -> false -> candidate_remove_min = 7-3 = 4.\n            is_max_duplicate = (4>1 and 7==3) -> false -> candidate_remove_max = 3-1 = 2.\n            answer = 2.\n\n        But the example output is 2.\n\n        However, wait: the example input is \"4\\n1 3 3 7\", and the expected output is 2.\n\n        But our candidate_remove_min was 4, and candidate_remove_max was 2, so we choose 2.\n\n        However, note: the example says: remove 7 then instability becomes 3-1=2. But wait, after removing 7, the array is [1,3,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> 3-1=2.\n\n        But in our candidate_remove_max, we did: (b[-2] - b[0]) = 3-1=2.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        But what if we remove a 3? Then the array becomes [1,3,7] -> min=1, max=7 -> instability=6, which is worse.\n\n        So the candidates are only the removal of the smallest or the largest.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n        Steps:\n          1. Read n.\n          2. Read the list of n integers.\n          3. Sort the list.\n          4. Check if n==1? (but n>=2 per problem, so skip)\n          5. Let b = sorted list.\n\n          6. Check if the array has duplicates for the smallest: \n                is_min_dup = (n > 1) and (b[0] == b[1])\n          7. Check if the array has duplicates for the largest:\n                is_max_dup = (n > 1) and (b[-1] == b[-2])\n\n          8. candidate1 = \n                if is_min_dup: b[-1] - b[0]\n                else: b[-1] - b[1]\n\n          9. candidate2 = \n                if is_max_dup: b[-1] - b[0]\n                else: b[-2] - b[0]\n\n          10. Print min(candidate1, candidate2)\n\n        However, wait: what if the array has only one distinct value? For example, [5,5,5,5] (n=4)\n            sorted: [5,5,5,5]\n            is_min_dup: (4>1 and 5==5) -> True -> candidate1 = 5-5=0.\n            is_max_dup: (4>1 and 5==5) -> True -> candidate2 = 5-5=0.\n            Then answer=0.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if the array has two elements and they are the same? [5,5] (n=2)\n            sorted: [5,5]\n            is_min_dup: (2>1 and 5==5) -> True -> candidate1 = 5-5=0.\n            is_max_dup: (2>1 and 5==5) -> True -> candidate2 = 5-5=0.\n            Then answer=0.\n\n        And the instability after removing one element is 0 (because the remaining element is 5, so 5-5=0). Correct.\n\n        One more edge: [1,2] (already done) -> 0.\n\n        But wait: what if the array has three elements? [1,2,3] (n=3)\n            sorted: [1,2,3]\n            is_min_dup: (3>1 and 1==2) -> False -> candidate1 = 3-2=1.\n            is_max_dup: (3>1 and 3==2) -> False -> candidate2 = 2-1=1.\n            Then answer=1.\n\n        Check: \n            Remove 1: [2,3] -> instability=1.\n            Remove 3: [1,2] -> instability=1.\n            Remove 2: [1,3] -> instability=2.\n\n        So the minimum instability is 1. Correct.\n\n        However, note: we are only considering two candidates. But what if we remove an element that is not the min or max? Then the instability is 2, which is worse. So the minimum is 1.\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n        Note: There's a catch: our candidate_remove_min uses b[-1] (the original max) and if the min is duplicated then we use b[0] (the original min) for the new min. But if the min is duplicated, then the new min is still the original min, so the instability is the same as the original? \n\n        Example: [1,1,2] -> \n            original instability = 2-1=1.\n            candidate_remove_min: is_min_dup=True -> candidate1 = 2-1=1.\n            candidate_remove_max: is_max_dup=False -> candidate2 = 1-1=0.\n\n        So we return 0, which is correct.\n\n        But wait: in [1,1,2] the original instability is 1, and after removing the max (which is 2) the instability becomes 0, so we don't care about the original instability.\n\n        The two candidates are independent.\n\n        However, we must note: the candidate_remove_min does not necessarily mean we are removing the min and then the instability becomes candidate_remove_min. It is the instability after removing one occurrence of the min (any one occurrence). Similarly for the max.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to remove only one element. We are considering two possibilities: remove one occurrence of the min, and remove one occurrence of the max.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is the minimum between these two possibilities.\n\n        But wait: what if we remove an element that is the min and also the max? Then we are effectively removing one occurrence. But if the array has only one distinct value, then min and max are the same. Then the two candidates are the same.\n\n        Example: [5,5] -> both candidates 0.\n\n        So the code is:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n        if n == 1:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            # Check for duplicates at the boundaries\n            is_min_dup = (a[0] == a[1]) if n > 1 else False\n            is_max_dup = (a[-1] == a[-2]) if n > 1 else False\n\n            # But note: if n==2, then a[1] exists and a[-2] exists.\n\n            cand1 = a[-1] - a[0] if is_min_dup else a[-1] - a[1]\n            cand2 = a[-1] - a[0] if is_max_dup else a[-2] - a[0]\n\n            # However, wait: in cand1, if we remove the min, then the new min is a[0] if there are duplicates, else a[1]. Then the max is always a[-1] (unless we remove the max too, but we are only removing one element). But if the min and max are the same, then we are removing one occurrence and the max remains the same.\n\n            # But what if we remove the min and the array has duplicates for the min, then the new min is a[0] and the max is a[-1] -> instability = a[-1]-a[0] (same as original). \n            # Similarly, if we remove the max and there are duplicates for the max, then the new max is a[-1] and the min is a[0] -> same as original.\n\n            # However, note: we are computing two separate candidates: one for removing the min and one for removing the max.\n\n            # But wait: what if the array is [1,2,3,4,5] (n=5)\n            #   cand1: is_min_dup? 1==2 -> no -> cand1 = 5-2=3\n            #   cand2: is_max_dup? 5==4 -> no -> cand2 = 4-1=3\n            #   answer=3.\n\n            # Check: \n            #   Remove 1: [2,3,4,5] -> instability=3\n            #   Remove 5: [1,2,3,4] -> instability=3\n            #   Remove 3: [1,2,4,5] -> instability=4 -> worse.\n\n            # So 3 is correct.\n\n            print(min(cand1, cand2))\n\n        But wait, there's a flaw: \n\n        Consider [1,2,3,100] (n=4)\n            sorted: [1,2,3,100]\n            is_min_dup: 1==2 -> False -> cand1 = 100-2 = 98\n            is_max_dup: 100==3 -> False -> cand2 = 3-1 = 2\n            Then we print 2.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        However, note that in cand1, we are assuming that when we remove the min, the max remains the same (which is true) and the new min is a[1] (which is 2). Then instability=100-2=98.\n\n        But wait, is there a possibility that by removing an element that is not the min or max we can get a better result? \n\n        Example: [1,2,3,100] \n            Removing 2: [1,3,100] -> instability=99\n            Removing 3: [1,2,100] -> instability=99\n\n        So no, we don't.\n\n        But consider [1, 100, 101, 102] (n=4)\n            sorted: [1,100,101,102]\n            cand1: remove min -> new min=100, max=102 -> instability=2\n            cand2: remove max -> new max=101, min=1 -> instability=100\n            Then answer=2.\n\n        But wait, what if we remove 100? Then the array becomes [1,101,102] -> instability=101-1=100.\n        What if we remove 101? Then the array becomes [1,100,102] -> instability=102-1=101.\n\n        So the minimum is 2 (by removing the min).\n\n        However, consider [1, 100, 101, 102] and remove the min: 1 -> [100,101,102] -> instability=102-100=2.\n\n        But note: the instability is defined as max-min. So yes.\n\n        But wait, what if we remove 100? Then the min is 1 (still) and max is 102 -> 101.\n\n        So the candidate_remove_min is the best.\n\n        However, note: the candidate_remove_min is computed as the instability after removing the min, which is 102-100=2.\n\n        But wait: is the candidate_remove_min computed correctly? \n            We have: \n                is_min_dup: 1==100? -> False -> cand1 = 102-100=2.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        But what if we have [1, 100, 101, 102] and we remove 1, then the array is [100,101,102] -> min=100, max=102 -> 2.\n\n        Now, consider [1, 100, 101, 102] and we remove 102 (the max) -> [1,100,101] -> min=1, max=101 -> 100.\n\n        So the two candidates are 2 and 100, and the answer is 2.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, wait: what if we remove the element 100 (which is the second smallest) and the array becomes [1,101,102] -> min=1, max=102 -> 101, which is worse.\n\n        So our method of only considering removal of the min and the max is valid because:\n\n          - Removing an element that is not the min or max",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the instability of the array is determined by its maximum and minimum values. Removing any element that is not the current minimum or maximum will not change these values, hence the instability remains the same. Therefore, the optimal solution must involve either removing the minimum element or the maximum element (or both if they are the same) to potentially reduce the instability.\n\n2. **Intuition**: By removing one occurrence of the minimum element, the new minimum might stay the same if there are duplicates, or it might increase to the next smallest value. Similarly, removing the maximum element might keep the maximum the same if there are duplicates or decrease it to the next largest value. The goal is to compute the instability after each of these removals and choose the smaller value.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps easily identify the minimum and maximum elements.\n   - **Check for Duplicates**: Determine if the minimum or maximum elements appear more than once. This affects whether their removal changes the minimum or maximum of the remaining array.\n   - **Calculate Candidates**: Compute two candidate instabilities:\n     - **Candidate 1**: Instability after removing one occurrence of the minimum element.\n     - **Candidate 2**: Instability after removing one occurrence of the maximum element.\n   - **Result**: The answer is the minimum of these two candidates.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, which is efficient given the constraint n ≤ 10^5. The subsequent steps involve simple comparisons and arithmetic operations, making the overall approach efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        is_min_dup = (a[0] == a[1])\n        is_max_dup = (a[-1] == a[-2])\n        \n        cand1 = a[-1] - a[0] if is_min_dup else a[-1] - a[1]\n        cand2 = a[-1] - a[0] if is_max_dup else a[-2] - a[0]\n        \n        print(min(cand1, cand2))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.\n2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the minimum and maximum elements.\n3. **Edge Case Handling**: If the array has only one element (though constraints ensure `n ≥ 2`), the instability is trivially zero.\n4. **Duplicate Check**: The code checks if the minimum or maximum elements have duplicates by comparing adjacent values in the sorted array.\n5. **Candidate Calculation**: \n   - **Candidate 1**: If the minimum element is duplicated, removing one instance leaves the minimum unchanged, so the instability remains the same. Otherwise, the new minimum is the second smallest element.\n   - **Candidate 2**: Similarly, if the maximum element is duplicated, removing one instance leaves the maximum unchanged. Otherwise, the new maximum is the second largest element.\n6. **Result**: The minimum of the two candidates is printed, representing the least possible instability after removing one element.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to two critical scenarios, leveraging sorting and simple comparisons to derive the solution.",
