Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов. В самом начале копирования оба прогресс-бара показывают $$$0$$$ процентов.Найдите все такие целые числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно, что существует момент времени, в который оба прогресс-бара одновременно показывают это число. Выведите эти числа в порядке возрастания.\n\n## Input\nВ первой строке задано одно целое число $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — число копируемых файлов.Во второй строке заданы $$$n$$$ целых чисел $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$$$) — размеры файлов в байтах в том порядке, в котором они будут копироваться.\n\n## Output\nВыведите в возрастающем порядке все числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно такие, что существует момент времени, в который на обоих прогресс-барах одновременно показывается это число.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\n### Output\n['0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100', '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100', '0\\n50\\n99\\n100', '0\\n17\\n43\\n44\\n84\\n90\\n99\\n100']\n\n## Note\nВ первом тесте копируется всего один файл, поэтому оба прогресс-бара всегда показывают одинаковые значения.Во втором тесте первый прогресс-бар сразу же уйдёт вперёд, потом сбросится в ноль и начнёт догонять второй прогресс-бар заново. В конце копирования прогресс-бары некоторое время будут показывать одно и то же число.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given up to 100 files, each of size at most 1000 bytes (so total size <= 100000 bytes). We need to find all integers x in [0,100] such that there exists a moment during the copying process when both progress bars show x.\n\n The first progress bar (current file) at byte x of file i: floor(100*x / a_i)\n The second progress bar (total so far): floor(100*(sum_{j=1}^{i-1} a_j + x) / total_sum)\n\n Note: The entire process goes file by file. So we can break the process into segments for each file.\n\n However, note: the second progress bar is cumulative and depends on the total sum of all files.\n\n Let S = a1 + a2 + ... + an.\n\n For a fixed file i (with size a_i), we are going to consider x from 0 to a_i (inclusive). At each x, we have:\n   p1 = floor(100 * x / a_i)\n   p2 = floor(100 * (S_prev + x) / S)   where S_prev = sum_{j=1}^{i-1} a_j\n\n We are to check if at some x (at the moment when we have copied x bytes of the i-th file) we have p1 == p2 == k (for some k).\n\n But note: the problem asks for all k from 0 to 100 (if they appear at any moment) in increasing order.\n\n However, note that k must be an integer in [0,100]. Also, note that k=100 might only occur at the very end of the last file.\n\n Approach:\n\n 1. Precompute the total sum S = sum(a_i)\n 2. Precompute prefix sums: prefix[i] = a1+a2+...+a_i (for i from 1 to n)\n    Then the total so far at the beginning of file i is prefix[i-1] (with prefix[0]=0)\n\n 3. For each file i (from 0 to n-1) and for each x from 0 to a_i (but note: we don't want to iterate over every single byte because a_i can be up to 1000 and n<=100 -> maximum 100*1000=100000 which is acceptable? But wait, 100*1000=100000, and we have 100 files, so worst-case 100*1000=100000 iterations, which is acceptable in Python.)\n\n However, note that we have to check for each k from 0 to 100 if there's at least one moment (any file, any x) that gives that k.\n\n But we cannot iterate over k and then over x (because k is 0..100, and for each k we would have to check many x). Alternatively, we can iterate over all the moments (each file and each byte) and record which k's we have seen.\n\n Steps:\n\n  - Initialize a set `found` for the k values that appear.\n\n  - For each file index i (0-indexed), let a = a_i, and let total_so_far_before = prefix[i] (if we define prefix[i] as the sum of first i files, then for the i-th file (0-indexed) the previous total is prefix[i] - a_i? Actually, we defined prefix[i] = a0+a1+...+a_{i-1}? Let me clarify:\n\n    Let's define:\n        prefix[0] = 0\n        prefix[i] = a0 + a1 + ... + a_{i-1}\n\n    Then for file i (0-indexed), the total so far before starting this file is prefix[i], and the current file has size a_i.\n\n    Then the total after copying x bytes of file i is T = prefix[i] + x.\n\n    The first progress bar: p1 = floor(100 * x / a_i)\n    The second progress bar: p2 = floor(100 * T / S) = floor(100 * (prefix[i] + x) / S)\n\n    Now, note: the second progress bar depends on the entire total S (which we precomputed).\n\n  - For each file i, and for x from 0 to a_i (inclusive):\n\n        p1 = (100 * x) // a_i   [if a_i>0, else handle separately but a_i>=1]\n        p2 = (100 * (prefix[i] + x)) // S   [Note: integer floor division]\n\n        Then if p1 == p2, then we add p1 to our set (if p1 is between 0 and 100, which it should be).\n\n  - However, note: the problem says \"exists a moment\", and we are checking every byte. But note: the same k might appear multiple times, but we only need to record that k appears at least once.\n\n  - After processing all files, we have a set of k's. Then we need to output them in increasing order (from 0 to 100, but only those that appeared).\n\n But wait: is it possible that the same k appears in multiple files? Yes, but we only need to know if it appears at least once.\n\n However, note: the example input '2\\n100 500' outputs [0,95,96,97,98,99,100]. So we must capture k=95 to 100.\n\n But wait, why does k=95 to 99 appear? They must appear during the copying of the second file.\n\n However, note that the second file is 500 bytes. The cumulative total after the first file is 100. Then when we start the second file, the total becomes 600. \n\n Let's check: \n   For the second file, x from 0 to 500.\n\n   At x, the first progress bar: floor(100*x/500) = floor(0.2*x)\n   The second progress bar: floor(100*(100+x)/600)\n\n   We need to see if there exists an x (integer from 0 to 500) such that floor(0.2*x) = floor(100*(100+x)/600)\n\n   Example: x=475 -> 0.2*475 = 95, so p1=95.\n            T = 100+475 = 575, then 100*575/600 = 57500/600 ≈ 95.833..., floor is 95 -> matches.\n\n   Similarly, x=476: p1= floor(100*476/500)= floor(95.2)=95, p2= floor(100*(576)/600)=floor(96)=96 -> not same.\n\n   But then how do we get 96?\n\n   For 96: \n        p1 = floor(0.2*x) = 96 -> 0.2*x >=96 and <97 -> x>=480 and x<475? Actually, 0.2*x >=96 -> x>=480, then 0.2*x <97 -> x<485.\n\n        Then for x from 480 to 484, p1=96.\n\n        Now check p2: at x=480: T=100+480=580, 100*580/600≈96.666 -> floor=96 -> matches.\n\n        Similarly, x=484: T=584, 100*584/600≈97.333 -> floor=97 -> so for x=484, p1=96 but p2=97.\n\n        So only x=480 to 483 will yield p2=96? Actually, we must check:\n\n        x=480: p2 = floor(100*580/600)=96 -> yes.\n        x=481: p2 = floor(100*581/600)= floor(96.833)=96\n        x=482: p2 = floor(100*582/600)= floor(97.0)=97 -> no, wait, 582/6=97 exactly? Actually, 582/6=97, so 100*(582/600)=582/6=97 -> so 97.\n\n        Actually, 582/600 = 0.97, so 100*0.97=97 -> floor(97)=97.\n\n        So x=480: p1=96, p2=96 -> valid.\n        x=481: p1=96, p2= floor(100*581/600)= floor(96.833)=96 -> valid.\n        x=482: p1=96, p2=97 -> invalid.\n\n        Therefore, k=96 appears at x=480 and 481.\n\n   Similarly, k=97: \n        p1=97: 0.2*x >=97 and <98 -> x>=485 and x<490.\n\n        Then check for x=485 to 489:\n          x=485: T=100+485=585, 100*585/600=58500/600=97.5 -> floor=97 -> so matches.\n\n        x=486: T=586, 586/6=97.666 -> floor=97 -> matches.\n        x=487: T=587, 587/6≈97.833 -> floor=97 -> matches.\n        x=488: T=588, 588/6=98 -> floor=98 -> not 97.\n        x=489: T=589, 589/6≈98.166 -> floor=98.\n\n        So k=97 appears at x=485,486,487.\n\n   And so on.\n\n  However, note: the problem says \"exists a moment\", so even if we see k=96 twice (at different x) we only need to record k=96 once.\n\n  But note: the same k might appear in different files. That's okay.\n\n Implementation:\n\n  Steps:\n\n  1. Read n.\n  2. Read list a of n integers.\n  3. Compute total_sum = sum(a)\n  4. Compute prefix sums: \n        prefix[0] = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n\n        But note: for the i-th file (0-indexed), the previous total is prefix[i] (which is the sum of the first i files).\n\n  5. Initialize an empty set `results = set()`\n\n  6. For i in range(n):\n        current_file_size = a[i]\n        prev_total = prefix[i]   # because prefix[i] is the sum of the first i files (indices 0 to i-1)\n\n        For x in range(0, current_file_size+1):\n            # First progress bar: \n            p1 = (100 * x) // current_file_size   # This is an integer, floor division.\n\n            # Second progress bar:\n            total_so_far = prev_total + x\n            p2 = (100 * total_so_far) // total_sum\n\n            if p1 == p2:\n                # Then we found that at this moment the two progress bars show the same value, say k = p1.\n                # We only care about k being between 0 and 100 (but p1 and p2 are computed to be in [0,100] because of floor division and the fact that x<=current_file_size, and total_so_far<=total_sum)\n                # But note: p1 might be 100 even if not complete? Actually, if x=current_file_size, then p1= (100*current_file_size)//current_file_size = 100, and similarly p2= (100*(prev_total+current_file_size))//total_sum = (100*total_sum)//total_sum = 100.\n\n                # Add p1 to the set (since p1==p2).\n                results.add(p1)\n\n  7. Now, we have to output all numbers from 0 to 100 that are in the set, in increasing order.\n\n  8. Print each number on its own line.\n\n But wait: is it possible that a k in [0,100] never appears? Then we don't output it.\n\n However, note: at the very beginning (x=0) we have p1=0 and p2=0, so k=0 always appears.\n\n Also, at the very end (after the last byte of the last file) we have p1=100 and p2=100, so k=100 always appears.\n\n But what about k=1 to 99? It might not appear in some cases.\n\n However, note: the example with one file: we get all multiples of 100/current_file_size, but also the cumulative one must match. But the example output for one file is 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\n Example: n=1, a=[6]\n   total_sum=6, prefix[0]=0, then for x from 0 to 6.\n\n   x=0: p1=0, p2=0 -> record 0.\n   x=1: p1= (100*1)//6 = 16 (since 100/6≈16.66 -> floor=16), p2= (100*1)//6=16 -> record 16.\n   x=2: p1= (200)//6=33, p2= (200)//6=33 -> record 33.\n   x=3: p1=50, p2=50 -> record 50.\n   x=4: p1= (400)//6=66, p2=66 -> record 66.\n   x=5: p1= (500)//6=83, p2=83 -> record 83.\n   x=6: p1=100, p2=100 -> record 100.\n\n   Then we output [0,16,33,50,66,83,100] in increasing order.\n\n  This matches the first example.\n\n  But wait: the example input was provided as:\n      Input: ['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\n  And the expected outputs were:\n      ['0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100', '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100', '0\\n50\\n99\\n100', '0\\n17\\n43\\n44\\n84\\n90\\n99\\n100']\n\n  So our algorithm produces the first example correctly.\n\n  However, let's test the second example: n=2, [100,500]\n\n  total_sum=600\n  prefix[0]=0, then for the first file (100 bytes):\n        x from 0 to 100.\n\n        p1 = (100*x)//100 = x   (if x<100 then p1=x, but at x=100, p1=100)\n        p2 = (100*(x))//600   [since prev_total=0]\n\n        We need to check for which x (0<=x<=100) we have x == (100*x)//600.\n\n        For x=0: 0==0 -> record 0.\n        For x=1: 1 == (100*1)//600 = 0 -> no.\n        ...\n        For x=6: 6 == (600)//600 = 1 -> no.\n\n        Actually, (100*x)//600 = floor(100*x/600) = floor(x/6)\n\n        So we require x == floor(x/6). This holds only for x=0.\n\n        Then we move to the second file (500 bytes), with prev_total=100.\n\n        For x from 0 to 500:\n\n        p1 = (100*x)//500\n        p2 = (100*(100+x))//600\n\n        We need to check for x from 0 to 500.\n\n        We already saw that k=95,96,97,98,99,100 appear.\n\n        But note: k=1 to 94 also might appear? According to the example output, we only output 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\n        So we must not output k=1 to 94.\n\n        Why? Because the condition is that both progress bars show the same k. In the first file, we only got k=0.\n\n        In the second file, we get k=95 to 100. But note: the second progress bar at the beginning of the second file (x=0) is (100*100)//600 = 16, and the first progress bar is 0, so 0 != 16. Then as we copy the second file, the first progress bar increases by 0.2 per byte, and the second by (1/6)% per byte.\n\n        The example output says we only get 0 and 95-100.\n\n        So our algorithm must not record k=1 to 94 because they never appear.\n\n        Therefore, we are only recording the k that actually occur.\n\n  However, note: k=100 is recorded at the end of the last file.\n\n  But wait: in the second example, the first file ends with k=0 (at the last byte of the first file, x=100) because the first progress bar is 100, but the second progress bar is floor(100*100/600)=16. So at the end of the first file, the first progress bar jumps to 100, but the second is still 16. Then during the second file, we start at 16 (from the first file) and the first progress bar starts at 0 and goes up to 100, while the second progress bar goes from 16 to 100. \n\n  The example output only lists 0 and 95-100. Why don't we get k=16? \n\n  Actually, we do get k=16 during the second file? \n\n      Condition: p1 = p2 = 16.\n\n      p1 = 16: (100*x)//500 = 16 -> 16 <= (100*x)/500 < 17 -> 80 <= x < 85.\n\n      Then for x in [80,84]:\n          p1 = 16.\n\n      Now p2 = (100*(100+x))//600 = (100*(100+x))//600.\n\n      For x=80: T=180, (100*180)//600 = 30 -> not 16.\n      For x=81: T=181, 18100//600 = 30 (since 18100/600≈30.166 -> floor=30)\n      ... until x=475: T=575, 57500//600≈95.833 -> 95.\n\n      So no x in [80,84] gives p2=16.\n\n      Similarly, k=16 might appear only at the beginning of the second file? But at the beginning of the second file (x=0) we have p1=0, p2=16.\n\n      Then as we copy the second file, the first progress bar starts from 0 and increases, but the second progress bar is fixed at 16 until we copy enough to push the cumulative percentage above 16? Actually, the second progress bar updates continuously: after the first file, we are at 16. Then when we copy the next byte, the cumulative becomes (100+x) (in terms of the second progress bar: floor(100*(100+x)/600)). \n\n      However, note: the second progress bar is updated after every byte. So at x=0 (first byte of the second file) we are at 16. Then at x=1: cumulative = 101, which is 101/600*100≈16.833 -> floor=16. Then at x= something we might get 16 again? Actually, the cumulative percentage increases slowly.\n\n      But note: the first progress bar (for the second file) is 0 at x=0, then 0.2, 0.4, ... until 100. \n\n      The condition for k=16: we need both to be 16.\n\n        p1=16: requires 80<=x<=84 (as above) but then p2 is 30, not 16.\n\n      What about k=16 at the beginning of the second file? Actually, at the beginning of the second file (x=0) we have p1=0 and p2=16 -> not equal.\n\n      Then when does k=16 appear? It doesn't. \n\n      Similarly, k=1 to 15 and 17 to 94 do not appear.\n\n  Therefore, the algorithm is correct.\n\n  However, note: the example output for the second example is [0,95,96,97,98,99,100]. \n\n  But wait, the example output string is: '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100'\n\n  Why do we get 0 and then 95-100? \n\n      We get 0 from the first file (at x=0 and also at the end of the first file? Actually, at the end of the first file, p1=100, p2=16 -> not 0. But at x=0 (the very beginning) we have 0. Also, during the first file, when x=0, we have 0. Then during the second file, we don't get 0 again until the very end? Actually, the second file starts with x=0 (which we already considered) and then x increases. The first progress bar for the second file is 0 only at x=0. Then the second progress bar at x=0 is 16, so 0!=16.\n\n      So 0 only appears at the beginning (and maybe at the end of the first file? No, because at the end of the first file, the first progress bar is 100, not 0). \n\n      Actually, the first file: we have x=0 (start) and then x=100 (end). At x=0 we record 0. Then at the end of the first file, we don't record 0 again because p1=100 and p2=16.\n\n      But note: the problem says \"exists a moment\", so we only need one moment.\n\n      Therefore, 0 is recorded.\n\n  Now, the third example: n=4, [1000,2,2,998] -> expected output: [0,50,99,100]\n\n  total_sum = 1000+2+2+998 = 2002\n\n  We must simulate:\n\n  File0: 1000 bytes, prev_total=0.\n        We record k=0 (at x=0) and then for x from 1 to 1000.\n\n        p1 = (100*x)//1000\n        p2 = (100*x)//2002\n\n        We are looking for x such that (100*x)//1000 = (100*x)//2002.\n\n        Note: (100*x)//1000 = floor(0.1*x) and (100*x)//2002 = floor( (100*x)/2002 ).\n\n        We need to check if there's any x in [0,1000] for which these are equal.\n\n        x=0: both 0 -> record 0.\n        x=1: 0 vs 0 -> record 0 (but we already have 0, so set remains {0})\n        x=2: 0 vs 0 -> record 0.\n        ...\n        x=10: 1 vs 0 -> no.\n        x=20: 2 vs 0 -> no.\n\n        Actually, the second progress bar: (100*x)/2002 is less than 1 until x=20 (because 100*20/2002≈0.99, floor=0). So for x from 0 to 19, p2=0. Then for x from 20 to ... ?\n\n        But p1: at x=20: floor(100*20/1000)=2, and p2=0 -> not equal.\n\n        Then when does p1 equal p2? Only when p1=0, which is when x<10 (because 100*x/1000 <1 -> x<10) and then p2=0. So for x from 0 to 9, we have p1=0 and p2=0 -> so we record 0.\n\n        Then for x>=10, p1>=1, and p2 remains 0 until x>=20? Then p2 becomes 1 at x=20? Actually, (100*20)/2002≈0.99, so floor=0. Then at x=21: (100*21)/2002≈1.048 -> floor=1.\n\n        Then we need p1=p2=1: \n            p1=1: 1<= (100*x)/1000 <2 -> 10<=x<20.\n            p2=1: 1<= (100*x)/2002 <2 -> 20<=x<40.1 -> so no overlap.\n\n        Then k=1 doesn't appear.\n\n        Similarly, k=2: \n            p1=2: 20<=x<30.\n            p2=2: 2<= (100*x)/2002 <3 -> 40<=x<60.1 -> no overlap.\n\n        ...\n\n        k=50: \n            p1=50: 500<=x<600 -> but the file is only 1000, so x from 500 to 599.\n            p2=50: 50<= (100*x)/2002 <51 -> (50*2002 <= 100*x <51*2002) -> 1000 <= x < 1005.02 -> but our file is 1000, so x from 1000 to 1000 (only the last byte). \n\n            At x=1000: p1= floor(100*1000/1000)=100, p2= floor(100*1000/2002)= floor(100000/2002)=49.95 -> floor=49.\n\n            So k=50 does not appear in the first file.\n\n        Then we go to the next files.\n\n        File1: size=2, prev_total=1000.\n            x from 0 to 2.\n            p1 = (100*x)//2\n            p2 = (100*(1000+x))//2002\n\n            x=0: p1=0, p2= floor(100*1000/2002)=49 -> not equal.\n            x=1: p1=50, p2= floor(100*1001/2002)= floor(100100/2002)=50 (because 100100/2002=50.0 exactly?) -> yes, 2002*50=100100 -> so 50. Then record 50.\n            x=2: p1=100, p2= floor(100*1002/2002)= floor(100200/2002)=50.049... -> floor=50 -> not 100.\n\n        Then we record 50.\n\n        Then file2: size=2, prev_total=1002 (1000+2)\n            x from 0 to 2.\n            p1 = (100*x)//2\n            p2 = (100*(1002+x))//2002\n\n            x=0: p1=0, p2= floor(100*1002/2002)=50 -> not equal.\n            x=1: p1=50, p2= floor(100*1003/2002)= floor(100300/2002)=50.0999... -> floor=50 -> record 50 (already recorded).\n            x=2: p1=100, p2= floor(100*1004/2002)= floor(100400/2002)=50.149... -> floor=50 -> not 100.\n\n        Then file3: size=998, prev_total=1004.\n            x from 0 to 998.\n            p1 = (100*x)//998\n            p2 = (100*(1004+x))//2002\n\n            We are interested in k=99 and k=100.\n\n            k=100: only at the end of the file, x=998: p1= floor(100*998/998)=100, p2= floor(100*(1004+998)/2002)= floor(100*2002/2002)=100 -> record 100.\n\n            k=99: \n                p1=99: 99<= (100*x)/998 <100 -> (99*998 <= 100*x <100*998+1) -> x>= (99*998+1)//100? Actually, we can compute:\n\n                We need (100*x)//998 = 99 -> 99*998 <= 100*x < 100*998.\n\n                Solve for x: \n                    x_min = ceil(99*998/100) = ceil(98802/100)=ceil(988.02)=989\n                    x_max = (100*998-1)//100 = 997   [because 100*x < 100*998 => x < 998, so x_max=997]\n\n                But 989<=x<=997.\n\n                Now p2: we require (100*(1004+x))//2002 = 99.\n\n                99 <= (100*(1004+x))/2002 <100\n                => 99*2002 <= 100*(1004+x) <100*2002\n                => 198198 <= 100400 + 100*x < 200200\n                => 198198-100400 <= 100*x < 200200-100400\n                => 97798 <= 100*x < 99800\n                => 977.98 <= x < 998\n\n                So x from 978 to 997.\n\n                Now, we have from p1: x from 989 to 997, and from p2: x from 978 to 997. The intersection is x from 989 to 997.\n\n                Then we need to check if for any x in [989,997] the p2 is indeed 99.\n\n                Since the condition for p2 is 99<= (100*(1004+x))/2002 <100, and we have x from 989 to 997, then:\n\n                Let x=989: total_so_far=1004+989=1993, then (100*1993)/2002≈99.55 -> floor=99 -> matches.\n\n                Then we record 99.\n\n            Therefore, we have k=0,50,99,100.\n\n        This matches the expected output.\n\n  One more example: the fourth one: n=6, [170,130,400,256,30,100] -> expected output: [0,17,43,44,84,90,99,100]\n\n  We'll trust the simulation.\n\n  However, note: the above approach iterates over each file and each byte (0 to a_i). The worst-case total number of bytes is 100*1000 = 100000, which is acceptable.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  Important: use integer arithmetic (floor division) as described.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      n = int(input().strip())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n      total_sum = sum(a)\n      # Build prefix sums: length n+1, where prefix[i] is the sum of the first i files (i from 0 to n)\n      prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n      for i in range(1, n+1):\n          prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n      # Alternatively, we can use the prefix array without building the entire array beyond n, but we built for indices 0..n.\n\n      # Now, we traverse each file i (0-indexed) and for x from 0 to a[i] (inclusive)\n\n      found = set()\n\n      for i in range(n):\n          file_size = a[i]\n          prev_total = prefix[i]   # because prefix[i] is the sum of the first i files (from 0 to i-1)\n\n          # Iterate x from 0 to file_size\n          for x",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all integers from 0 to 100 that appear simultaneously on both progress bars during the copying of files from one server to another. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, while the second progress bar shows the cumulative percentage of all files copied so far. Both percentages are rounded down to the nearest integer.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves simulating the copying process of each file byte by byte and checking at each step if the two progress bars show the same percentage. The key insight is that for each file, we can compute the current file's progress and the cumulative progress after each byte is copied.\n2. **Intuition**: For each file, we iterate through all possible bytes (from 0 to the file's size). For each byte, we calculate the current file's progress percentage and the cumulative progress percentage. If these percentages match, we record the value.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Reading the input values (number of files and their sizes).\n   - Calculating the total sum of all file sizes.\n   - Using prefix sums to keep track of the cumulative data copied before each file starts.\n   - For each file, iterating through each byte (0 to file size) and computing both progress bars' values.\n   - Collecting all unique progress values that match during the simulation.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each file and each byte within the file. Given that there are up to 100 files, each with a maximum size of 1000 bytes, the total operations are 100 * 1000 = 100,000, which is efficient for modern computing.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    total_sum = sum(a)\n    prefix = [0] * (n+1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n    \n    found = set()\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        file_size = a[i]\n        prev_total = prefix[i]\n        for x in range(0, file_size + 1):\n            p1 = (100 * x) // file_size\n            total_so_far = prev_total + x\n            p2 = (100 * total_so_far) // total_sum\n            if p1 == p2:\n                found.add(p1)\n    \n    result_list = sorted(found)\n    for num in result_list:\n        print(num)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix array is built to store cumulative file sizes up to each position, facilitating quick calculation of the total data copied before processing each file.\n3. **Progress Bar Simulation**: For each file, the algorithm iterates through each possible byte (from 0 to the file's size). For each byte, it calculates the current file's progress percentage (`p1`) and the cumulative progress percentage (`p2`). If these values match, the percentage is added to a set to ensure uniqueness.\n4. **Output**: The unique percentages are sorted in ascending order and printed, providing the solution as required.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible moments during the file copying process where both progress bars display the same value, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
