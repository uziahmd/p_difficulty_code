Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of array elements.

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem.\n\n We are given:\n   n: an integer (the number of array elements)\n   an array a of n integers (a0 to a_{n-1})\n   a string s (without spaces) which is the binary representation of m (with no leading zeros, but note: it might have length n? Actually, note: the example input for m is given as a binary string without spaces. However, note that the example: \n        Input: \"2\\n3 8\\n10\" -> n=2, array [3,8], and binary string \"10\" (which is 2 in decimal). But wait, the example says: \"In the first test case m = 20 = 1\", so actually the binary string has length n? Not necessarily.\n\n However, note: the function f(x) is defined by the bits of x. The bit representation of x can have up to n bits? Actually, note that m is given by its binary representation s0 s1 ... s_{n-1}. So the number m has exactly n bits (if we consider the string of length n). But note: the example second sample: \"5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010\" -> n=5, and the binary string is \"11010\" (which is 5 bits). \n\n Important: the index i in the binary representation of x goes from 0 to n-1 (the least significant bit is at position 0). In the function f(x), we use the i-th bit (if set) then we add a_i.\n\n However, note: the array a has indices 0 to n-1. The problem says: f(x) = sum_{i} (bit(i) ? a_i : 0). But note: the example with n=4 and x=11 (binary 1011) then i runs from 0 to 3 (because n=4) and the bits are at positions 0,1,3 (so we take a0, a1, a3).\n\n But wait: the example says \"if n=4 and x=11 (11=2^0+2^1+2^3)\" -> so the bit representation of x has n bits (from the 0-th to the (n-1)-th bit). However, note that the example x=11 in base2 is 1011, which is 4 bits. \n\n Therefore, the binary representation of x we consider is exactly n bits (from the least significant bit to the most significant bit). \n\n But note: what if the given binary string for m is shorter than n? According to the input: the third line is a sequence of digits (zeros and ones) of length n? Actually, the problem states: \n   \"The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn-1\"\n\n So the binary representation of m is given as a string of length n. This means m is represented with n bits (possibly with leading ones, but note: the example \"10\" for n=2: then m is 2, which is '10' in binary, which is 2 bits).\n\n However, note: the constraint on x: 0<=x<=m. Since m is given by a binary string of length n, we know that x must be a number that can be represented by at most n bits (and we consider exactly n bits for x? Actually, the function f(x) uses the first n bits (from 0 to n-1). \n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We are to compute the maximum of f(x) for x in [0, m].\n\n Observation:\n   f(x) = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} [bit i of x is set] * a_i.\n\n Without the constraint x<=m, we would just set all bits for which a_i is positive and unset for negative? But note: the array a_i are nonnegative (0<=a_i<=10000). So without constraints, we would set every bit. Then f(x) would be the sum of all a_i.\n\n However, we are constrained by x<=m.\n\n So we have two cases:\n\n Case 1: Without the constraint, the best is to set every bit (so x = (1<<n)-1) but then we must check if this x is <= m.\n\n But note: the binary representation of m is given as a string of n bits (from most significant to least significant? Or from least to most?)\n\n Let me read the problem statement again: the binary representation of m is given as s0 s1 ... s_{n-1}. \n\n Example: n=2, m=2, then binary representation is",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) for all integers \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements \\( a_i \\) where the \\( i \\)-th bit of \\( x \\) is set. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that since all elements in the array \\( a \\) are non-negative, the optimal solution without any constraints would be to set all bits in \\( x \\) (i.e., \\( x = 2^n - 1 \\)). However, the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\) may prevent us from setting all bits. \n\n2. **Binary Representation Handling**: The binary representation of \\( m \\) is provided as a string of length \\( n \\). We process this string from left to right (most significant bit to least significant bit). For each bit position, if the corresponding bit in \\( m \\) is '1', we can safely set that bit in \\( x \\) because it will not exceed \\( m \\). If the bit in \\( m \\) is '0', setting the corresponding bit in \\( x \\) might make \\( x \\) exceed \\( m \\), unless all subsequent bits are zero.\n\n3. **Greedy Selection**: We iterate through each bit position. For each bit set in \\( m \\), we include the corresponding \\( a_i \\) in the sum. For bits not set in \\( m \\), we only consider including \\( a_i \\) if all higher bits have been set (i.e., if setting the current bit and all lower bits does not exceed \\( m \\)).\n\n4. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where \\( m \\) is zero or where all bits are set in \\( m \\) by directly computing the sum of all \\( a_i \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    s = data[2].strip()\n    \n    total_sum = sum(a)\n    if s == \"1\" * n:\n        print(total_sum)\n        return\n        \n    if s.count('0') == 0:\n        print(total_sum)\n        return\n\n    current_sum = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if s[i] == '1':\n            current_sum += a[i]\n        else:\n            if all(bit == '1' for bit in s[i:]):\n                current_sum += a[i]\n                \n    print(current_sum)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three parts: the integer \\( n \\), the array \\( a \\) of \\( n \\) integers, and the binary string representation of \\( m \\).\n\n2. **Initial Check**: If all bits in \\( m \\)'s binary representation are '1', then \\( x \\) can be \\( 2^n - 1 \\), and the sum of all elements in \\( a \\) is the answer.\n\n3. **Handling Zero Bits**: If there are no '0' bits in \\( m \\)'s binary string, again the sum of all elements in \\( a \\) is the answer since \\( m \\) allows all bits to be set.\n\n4. **Greedy Sum Calculation**: For each bit position from most significant to least significant:\n   - If the bit is '1', include \\( a_i \\) in the sum.\n   - If the bit is '0', check if all subsequent bits are '1'. If so, including \\( a_i \\) will not exceed \\( m \\), and thus \\( a_i \\) is added to the sum.\n\n5. **Output**: The computed sum is printed, which is the maximum value of \\( f(x) \\) under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the feasibility of setting each bit while respecting the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\), ensuring optimal performance even for large \\( n \\).",
