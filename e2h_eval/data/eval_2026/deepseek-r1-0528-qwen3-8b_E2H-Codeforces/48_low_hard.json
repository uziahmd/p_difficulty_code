He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem:\n\n We are given two tokens in the first line: a and b. \n   - a is an integer base (2 <= a <= 25)\n   - b can be either an integer (same constraints) or the letter 'R'\n\n Then we are given a string c which is a non-negative integer in base a (with possible leading zeros, but length <= 1000). The number is guaranteed to be such that if b is 'R', then the number is at most 300010 and not zero.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Convert the given string `c` from base `a` to base 10 (integer).\n    - Since the string might have digits beyond 9 (if base > 10) and up to 25, we'll map each character to a digit value.\n    - For example, if base is 12, then the digits are 0-9 and then 'A' for 10, 'B' for 11.\n\n 2. If b is an integer:\n    - Convert the base-10 integer to base b. We must represent it without leading zeros. Note: the base conversion must handle bases from 2 to 25. In bases greater than 10, we use letters: A for 10, B for 11, ... up to the base-1 (so for base 25, we use up to Y, because 0-9 and then A=10, B=11, ..., Y=24).\n\n 3. If b is 'R':\n    - Convert the base-10 integer to a Roman numeral. The problem states that the number is at most 300010 and not zero.\n\n However, note: the input number is given in base a, so first we convert to base 10, then to base b (if integer) or to Roman.\n\n Important: The input number string may contain leading zeros, but the problem says the length doesn't exceed 1000. We must convert correctly.\n\n Steps for converting from base a to base 10:\n\n   Let s = the input string (which is in base a)\n\n   We'll map each character in s to a digit. The mapping:\n      For digits '0' to '9': if the char is between '0' and '9', then digit = int(char)\n      For letters: if the char is between 'A' and ... then digit = 10 + (letter's position in the alphabet, starting from 'A'=10)\n\n   But note: the base a is between 2 and 25, so the maximum digit we might encounter is a-1. Therefore, if we see a letter, its value must be less than a.\n\n   Example: base 12, then the digits go from 0 to 11. So in base 12, the string \"A\" is allowed, which represents 10.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros\"\n\n   So the string might have digits that are beyond '9'. We need to check the base: if base is 10, then only digits 0-9 are allowed. If base is 11, then digits 0-10 are allowed, and 10 is represented by 'A'.\n\n   How to map:\n\n     We can create a function to convert a char to a digit given the base.\n\n   Steps for base conversion from base a to base 10:\n\n     num_base10 = 0\n     for each char in the string (from left to right, which is most significant to least):\n         digit_value = \n             if char is digit: int(char)\n             else: ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n\n         But wait: what if the base is 11? Then we can have up to 10. But if the base is 10, then we don't have letters. Also, the problem says the number is given in base a, so every char must represent a digit in [0, a-1].\n\n     However, note: the input string might contain letters even if base is 10? Actually, no: the problem says \"an integer number\", so for base 10, the digits should be 0-9. But the problem also says \"in base a\", so we assume the input string uses the minimal set of digits (from '0' to the representation of a-1). \n\n     Example: base 16 (hex) normally uses digits 0-9 and A-F. But here base is from 2 to 25, so the representation for base 16 would use 0-9 and then A-F (which",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, which could either be a standard base or a Roman numeral system. The solution involves three main steps: converting the input number from its given base to base 10, then converting the base 10 number to the desired output base (either an integer base or Roman numerals).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The input number is provided as a string in base `a`. We first convert this string into a decimal (base 10) integer. Each character in the string is converted to its corresponding digit value, considering that bases greater than 10 use letters (A for 10, B for 11, etc.). The conversion is done by processing each digit from left to right, multiplying the accumulated result by the base and adding the current digit's value.\n\n2. **Decimal to Target Base**: If the target base `b` is an integer, we convert the decimal number to base `b`. For bases greater than 10, digits beyond 9 are represented by letters (A=10, B=11, etc.). The conversion involves repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders, which are then mapped to their respective characters.\n\n3. **Decimal to Roman Numerals**: If the target base is 'R', we convert the decimal number to a Roman numeral. The conversion uses predefined rules for Roman numeral symbols, handling cases like subtractive notation (e.g., IV for 4, IX for 9). The number is broken down into thousands, hundreds, tens, and units, each part converted using standard Roman numeral mappings.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    a_str = first_line[0]\n    b_str = first_line[1] if len(first_line) > 1 else None\n\n    num_str = data[1].strip()\n\n    base_a = int(a_str)\n    if b_str == 'R':\n        base_b = 'R'\n    else:\n        base_b = int(b_str)\n\n    def to_base10(s, base):\n        num = 0\n        for char in s:\n            if char.isdigit():\n                digit_val = int(char)\n            else:\n                digit_val = 10 + (ord(char) - ord('A'))\n            num = num * base + digit_val\n        return num\n\n    base10_num = to_base10(num_str, base_a)\n\n    if base_b == 'R':\n        def to_roman(n):\n            if n == 0:\n                return \"\"\n            roman_map = [\n                ('M', 1000),\n                ('CM', 900), ('D', 500), ('CD', 400),\n                ('C', 100), ('XC', 90), ('L', 50), ('XL', 40),\n                ('X', 10), ('IX', 9), ('V', 5), ('IV', 4), ('I', 1)\n            ]\n            res = []\n            for numeral, value in roman_map:\n                while n >= value:\n                    res.append(numeral)\n                    n -= value\n            return ''.join(res)\n        \n        roman_num = to_roman(base10_num)\n        print(roman_num)\n    else:\n        base = base_b\n        if base10_num == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n        else:\n            digits = []\n            while base10_num:\n                remainder = base10_num % base\n                base10_num //= base\n                if remainder < 10:\n                    digits.append(str(remainder))\n                else:\n                    digits.append(chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n            print(''.join(digits[::-1]))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the base conversion parameters and the number to be converted.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The `to_base10` function processes each character of the input string, converting it to its numerical value based on the given base. This value is then used to compute the decimal equivalent by iteratively multiplying the accumulated result by the base and adding the current digit's value.\n3. **Conversion to Target Base**: If the target base is an integer, the decimal number is converted by repeatedly dividing by the base and collecting remainders. These remainders are converted to their respective characters (digits or letters) and combined in reverse order to form the result.\n4. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: For the Roman numeral conversion, the decimal number is decomposed into thousands, hundreds, tens, and units, each part being converted using a predefined mapping of Roman numeral symbols. The conversion handles subtractive notation (like IV for 4) by checking specific patterns in the number.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both standard base conversions and Roman numeral conversions, ensuring correctness and optimal performance for the given constraints.",
