The value (j - i + 1) denotes the length of the subsegment.Your task is to find the longest subsegment of a, such that it is possible to change at most one number (change one number to any integer you want) from the subsegment to make the subsegment strictly increasing.You only need to output the length of the subsegment you find.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).\n\n## Output\nIn a single line print the answer to the problem — the maximum length of the required subsegment.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6\\n7 2 3 1 5 6']\n\n### Output\n['5']\n\n## Note\nYou can choose subsegment a2, a3, a4, a5, a6 and change its 3rd element (that is a4) to 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are allowed to change at most one number. The goal is to find the longest subsegment that can be made strictly increasing by changing at most one element.\n\n Observation:\n 1. Without any change, we can have a contiguous strictly increasing sequence. But we are allowed to fix one broken part.\n\n Steps:\n - We can precompute two arrays:\n   * `left[i]`: length of strictly increasing subsegment ending exactly at i (with a[i] being the last element).\n   * `right[i]`: length of strictly increasing subsegment starting exactly at i (so from i to j).\n\n Then, we can consider three cases for a subsegment that we might fix by one change:\n\n Case 1: Entirely increasing without needing a fix (so we can take a segment that is already strictly increasing). \n   But note: we can also consider segments that are not entirely increasing but can be fixed by one change.\n\n However, note that the problem allows changing one number arbitrarily. So we can fix one drop in the sequence.\n\n Cases for a candidate segment [l, r] (0-indexed):\n\n  Option A: The segment is already strictly increasing -> then we can use it as is.\n\n  Option B: The segment has one violation (one drop) and we can fix that one drop (by changing one element) to make it strictly increasing.\n\n  But note: We might fix an element that is not the only problem? Actually, we are allowed to change only one element.\n\n  How can we combine?\n\n  We can consider:\n\n  Let L = left array, R = right array.\n\n  Then, for each index i (from 1 to n-2), we can consider:\n\n  Candidate 1: The entire segment that is strictly increasing (without any break) is covered by `L` or `R`.\n\n  Candidate 2: Consider a segment that has a break at position i (i.e., a[i] >= a[i+1]) but then the rest is increasing.\n\n  Actually, we can think of:\n\n  - If we have a segment that is already strictly increasing, then its length is at least the maximum value in L.\n\n  - Now, if we are allowed to fix one element, we might combine two increasing parts that are separated by one element (or even more than one? but note: we can fix one element so the break must be fixed by changing that one element).\n\n  However, note: we can fix one element anywhere in the segment. The segment might have multiple violations? But the problem says \"at most one change\". So we can only fix one violation. Therefore, the segment must have at most one drop (and then we fix that drop) OR we can fix an element that is not a drop but actually breaks the increasing condition in two ways? \n\n  Actually, we can also consider:\n\n  We can fix an element that is either:\n\n    Option 1: Fix an element that is too high (like making a peak into an increasing sequence) or too low.\n\n  But note: we want strictly increasing. \n\n  Example: [7, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6]\n\n  The example solution changes the 4th element (which is 1) to 4, so the subsegment becomes [2,3,4,5,6] which is strictly increasing.\n\n  How do we capture this?\n\n  We can consider:\n\n  Let's define:\n\n    left[i] = 1\n    for i from 1 to n-1:\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            left[i] = left[i-1] + 1\n        else:\n            left[i] = 1\n\n    Similarly, right[i] = 1\n        for i from n-2 down to 0:\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right[i] = right[i+1] + 1\n        else:\n            right[i] = 1\n\n  Then, consider:\n\n  Case 1: The entire segment is strictly increasing. Then answer can be at least max_i(left[i])\n\n  Case 2: We can fix one element. Then we can consider:\n\n      Option 1: Fix an element that is causing a drop. Specifically, we look for indices i (from 1 to n-2) such that:\n\n          a[i-1] < a[i+1]   and   we can set a[i] to something between a[i-1] and a[i+1]. Then the entire segment from i-left[i-1] to i+right[i+1] would be fixed.\n\n          Then the length would be: left[i-1] + right[i+1] + 1   [because we are including the fixed element at i]\n\n          But wait: the segment from i-left[i-1]+1 to i+right[i+1]-1 would be of length: (left[i-1] + right",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the longest subsegment of a sequence where we can change at most one number to make the entire subsegment strictly increasing. The solution involves analyzing the sequence to identify potential segments that can be adjusted with a single modification.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Arrays**: \n   - **Left Array (`left_arr`)**: This array stores the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment ending at each index.\n   - **Right Array (`right_arr`)**: This array stores the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment starting at each index.\n\n2. **Initial Maximum Length**:\n   - The initial maximum length is the maximum value in the `left_arr`, representing the longest strictly increasing subsegment without any modifications.\n\n3. **Check for One Modification**:\n   - For each element in the sequence (except the first and last), check if modifying it can merge two adjacent strictly increasing subsegments. Specifically, if the previous element is less than the next element, then modifying the current element to a value between them allows combining the left and right increasing subsegments.\n   - The potential length for such a modification is the sum of the lengths of the left and right increasing subsegments around the current element plus one (the modified element itself).\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Handle cases where the sequence length is 1 or 2 separately, as they cannot have a modification to form a longer strictly increasing subsegment beyond their natural lengths.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    left_arr = [1] * n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            left_arr[i] = left_arr[i-1] + 1\n            \n    right_arr = [1] * n\n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right_arr[i] = right_arr[i+1] + 1\n            \n    max_len = max(left_arr)\n    \n    for i in range(1, n-1):\n        if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n            max_len = max(max_len, left_arr[i-1] + right_arr[i+1] + 1)\n            \n    if n == 2:\n        print(2)\n        return\n        \n    print(max_len)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the sequence length and the sequence itself.\n2. **Edge Handling**: If the sequence has only one element, the answer is trivially 1. For sequences of length 2, the answer is 2 since no modification is needed or possible to increase the length.\n3. **Left and Right Arrays**: These arrays are computed to store the lengths of strictly increasing subsegments ending and starting at each index, respectively.\n4. **Initial Maximum**: The initial maximum length is determined by the longest strictly increasing subsegment found in the `left_arr`.\n5. **Modification Check**: For each element (except the first and last), the code checks if modifying it can merge two adjacent increasing subsegments. If so, the potential length is calculated and compared to the current maximum.\n6. **Output Result**: The maximum length found, considering both unmodified and one-modified segments, is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible segments that can be made strictly increasing with at most one modification, leveraging precomputed arrays to minimize redundant calculations.",
