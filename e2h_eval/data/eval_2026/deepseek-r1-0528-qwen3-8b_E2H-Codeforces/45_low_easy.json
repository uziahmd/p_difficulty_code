There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\nWe are to find the maximum number of games the winner can take part in, given that two players can play only if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\nObservation:\nIn a knockout tournament, the total number of games is n-1 (each game eliminates one player until one remains). However, the winner must win all his games. But note: we are not required to eliminate all players, but we are allowed to arrange the grid arbitrarily as long as the rule holds.\n\nThe key is to structure the tournament in such a way that the winner (player 1) can play as many games as possible.\n\nLet k be the number of games the winner plays. Then the winner must defeat k opponents. However, the tournament must be structured so that the rule (difference in number of games played is at most one) is satisfied for every match.\n\nWe can think of building the tournament bracket in rounds, but note that the rule is about the number of games each player has played so far. The winner will have k wins. So when the winner plays his first game, he has 0 games and the opponent must have either 0 or 1? Actually, initially no one has played any game, so the first game must have two players with 0 games.\n\nBut then, after the winner wins, he has 1 game. Now, when he plays again, the next opponent must have either 0, 1, or 2? But note the rule: the difference should be at most one. So the next opponent must have 0, 1, or 2 games? However, we want to maximize the number of games for the winner.\n\nWe can consider grouping the tournament into \"levels\". The idea is that the winner must go through several stages, and at each stage, he must face an opponent that has played at most one less game than the winner (or one more? but wait, the rule is symmetric). Actually, the rule says: two players can play if the absolute difference between their games is <= 1.\n\nBut note: the winner is accumulating games. So at the time of a match, the winner has played x games, and the opponent has played y games, and |x - y| <= 1.\n\nWe can model the tournament as having multiple rounds, but the winner might not necessarily play in consecutive rounds. However, we can also consider the entire tournament as being built in a way that the winner's path is as long as possible.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that the tournament is structured in a way that we have a complete binary tree of depth d, and the winner must traverse the tree. But note: the rule is about the total games played by each player at the moment of the match.\n\nAnother approach: Let f(k) be the minimum number of players required so that there exists a scenario where the winner can play k games.\n\nTo play k games, the winner must beat k opponents. However, each of these opponents must themselves have won some games (if they played more than one game). But note: the rule applies to the entire grid.\n\nActually, we can think recursively:\n\n- In the first game, the winner beats someone. Then we have k-1 games left.\n- For the second game, the winner must face someone who has played at most 1 game (since the winner has 1, so the opponent can have 0, 1, or 2? but wait, we are building the scenario from scratch).\n\nBut note: the entire tournament must be arranged so that the winner can accumulate k wins without violating the condition.\n\nConsider:\n\nRound 0: 1 player (the winner) and the rest are others.\n\nBut actually, we start with n players. We need to form a bracket.\n\nWe can also consider that the tournament is built by having subtrees. Let F(k) be the minimal number of players needed so that the winner can have k games.\n\nBase case: k=0 -> 1 player (the winner doesn't play any game, but we have n>=2 so we don't use this)\n\nk=1: \n  The winner plays one game. How many players? He must have an opponent. So total players = 2.\n\nk=2:\n  The winner must first play one game, then play again. But after the first game, the winner has 1 game. To play the second game, he must face an opponent that has at most 2 games (but wait, the opponent must have at least 1 game because the winner has 1, so the opponent can have 0 or 1 or 2? Actually, the opponent must have 0, 1, or 2 games. However, if the opponent has 0, then that opponent must have just entered the tournament and not played anyone. But then how did he get there? Actually, we can have:\n\nOption 1: \n  First round: two",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if the difference in the number of games they have already played is at most one. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the tournament structure must allow the winner to play as many games as possible without violating the given rule. The winner must defeat opponents in such a way that each subsequent opponent has played either the same number of games or one less game than the winner up to that point.\n2. **Insight**: The solution involves finding the largest integer \\( k \\) such that the total number of players required for the winner to play \\( k \\) games does not exceed \\( n \\). This can be derived by recognizing that the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play \\( k \\) games follows a specific pattern based on powers of 2.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves checking for the largest \\( k \\) where the sum of the first \\( k \\) terms of a sequence (which grows as \\( 2^k + 2^{k-1} + \\ldots \\)) is less than or equal to \\( n \\). This sequence represents the minimal number of players required for the winner to play \\( k \\) games under the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    k = 1\n    while True:\n        next_k = 2 * (2**k - 1)\n        if n <= next_k:\n            break\n        k += 1\n        \n    print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: If there are only 2 players, the winner can play only 1 game, so the answer is immediately 1.\n2. **Loop to Find Maximum k**: For larger \\( n \\), we start with \\( k = 1 \\) and iteratively check if the minimal number of players required for \\( k \\) games (given by \\( 2^k - 1 \\)) multiplied by 2 (to account for the next level) is sufficient to cover \\( n \\) players. The loop continues until \\( n \\) exceeds the required number of players for the current \\( k \\).\n3. **Output Result**: Once the loop exits, the current value of \\( k \\) is the maximum number of games the winner can play, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( k \\) by leveraging the properties of geometric series and ensures optimal performance even for very large \\( n \\) (up to \\( 10^{18} \\)).",
