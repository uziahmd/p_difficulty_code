Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are counting non-degenerate triangles (x, y, z) such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\n Conditions for a non-degenerate triangle: x + y > z.\n\n Since the sides are constrained by ranges, we can use the following approach:\n\n Let:\n   x in [A, B]\n   y in [B, C]   (Note: since B<=C, and also note that the condition is B<=y<=C)\n   z in [C, D]\n\n However, note that the constraints on x, y, z are independent except for the triangle inequality.\n\n The total number without the triangle condition is (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1). But we have to subtract the degenerate cases.\n\n Alternatively, we can fix two variables and then count the valid third variable. However, the ranges are large (up to 500000) so we need an efficient method.\n\n Another idea: use the necessary and sufficient condition for the triangle: \n   x + y > z, and note that we already have x+y >= A+B >= ... but wait, we also know that the sides must satisfy the triangle inequality.\n\n However, note that we have fixed ranges and the triangle condition is x+y>z.\n\n We can restructure the problem:\n\n Since x, y, z are bounded, we can try to count the pairs (x,y) and then for each pair, the number of z in [C, D] such that z < x+y.\n\n But note: the condition is x+y>z, so z must be less than x+y. Also, z must be at least C and at most D.\n\n So for a fixed (x,y), the condition on z is: C <= z <= min(D, x+y-1)\n\n Therefore, the number of z for (x,y) is: max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1)   [if min(D, x+y-1) >= C, else 0]\n\n Then the total number would be the sum over all x in [A, B] and all y in [B, C] of the above.\n\n But note: the ranges for x and y can be up to 500000, so the total pairs (x,y) is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) which can be as large as 25e10 (when A=1, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000, then x from 1 to 500000, y from 500000 to 500000 -> 500000*1 = 500000, but worst-case when A=1, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000, then x from 1 to 500000, y from 1 to 500000? Actually, wait: the input says A<=B<=C<=D, and the y range is [B, C]. In the worst-case, if B=1, C=500000, then (B-A+1) can be 500000, and (C-B+1) can be 500000, so the total pairs is 250e9, which is too many to iterate.\n\n We need a more efficient way.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n Instead of iterating over x and y, we can try to fix the value of x+y and then count the pairs (x,y) that produce a given s = x+y, and then for each s, the condition on z is that z < s and z>=C, so z from [C, min(D, s-1)].\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Let x in [A, B] and y in [B, C]. Then s = x+y ranges from A+B to B+C.\n\n 2. For each s, we want to count the number of pairs (x,y) such that x+y=s, with A<=x<=B and B<=y<=C.\n\n    Then, for each s, the number of z is: \n        L = max(C, s)   -> no, actually: we require z < s and z>=C, so z from [C, min(D, s-1)].\n        count_z(s) = max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1)   if s-1 >= C, otherwise 0.\n\n 3. Then the total triangles = sum_{s = min_sum}^{max_sum} [ count_pairs(s) * count_z(s) ]\n\n Now, how to compute count_pairs(s) quickly?\n\n We have:\n   x from [A, B], y from [B, C], and y = s - x.\n\n Conditions:\n   A <= x <= B\n   B <= s - x <= C\n\n Rearranged for x:\n   From y >= B: s - x >= B  => x <= s - B\n   From y <= C: s - x <= C  => x >= s - C\n\n Also, from x: A <= x <= B.\n\n Therefore, x must be in the intersection of [A, B] and [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)].\n\n So, the lower bound for x is L_x = max(A, s-C, ...) but note: we also have the condition from y: x <= s-B and x>=s-C, and also x>=A and x<=B.\n\n Actually, we can define:\n   low_x = max(A, s - C)   [because x>=A and x>=s-C (from y<=C)]\n   high_x = min(B, s - B)   [because x<=B and x<=s-B (from y>=B)]\n\n But wait: the condition from y>=B gives x <= s-B, and from y<=C gives x>=s-C.\n\n However, note that s = x+y, and x+y=s, so y=s-x. Then the constraints on y are B<=y<=C, i.e., B<=s-x<=C.\n\n So, we have two conditions on x: \n   x <= s - B   (from y>=B) and x>=s-C (from y<=C)\n\n And the original x constraints: A<=x<=B.\n\n Therefore, x must be in [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)] and also we require that the interval is non-empty: max(A, s-C) <= min(B, s-B).\n\n But note: we must also ensure that s-C <= s-B (which is true because C>=B) and the other bounds.\n\n However, note: the entire set of pairs (x,y) is defined only when s is at least A+B and at most B+C (since x>=A, y>=B, so s>=A+B; and x<=B, y<=C, so s<=B+C).\n\n So, we can iterate s from A+B to B+C, and for each s, count the number of x in [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)] (if the interval is valid) and then multiply by the number of z (if any).\n\n But the range of s is from A+B to B+C, which can be up to 500000+500000 = 1e6, so we can iterate over s from A+B to B+C (at most 1e6) and for each s, we do a constant time computation.\n\n However, note: the constraints say that A, B, C, D can be up to 500000, so the maximum s is B+C which is at most 1000000, and the minimum s is A+B which is at least 2 (but typically at least 1+1=2). The length of the s interval is (B+C - A+B + 1) = (C - A + 1) which is about 500000, so we can iterate over s from A+B to B+C.\n\n But wait, the problem says A<=B<=C<=D, so the minimum s is A+B, maximum s is B+C.\n\n Steps:\n\n   total = 0\n   for s from A+B to B+C:\n        low_x = max(A, s - C)\n        high_x = min(B, s - B)\n\n        If low_x <= high_x:\n            count_x = high_x - low_x + 1\n        Else:\n            count_x = 0\n\n        Then, the number of z for this s is: \n            low_z = C\n            high_z = min(D, s-1)   [since z must be <= D and < s (so <= s-1)]\n\n            If high_z < C: then count_z = 0\n            Else: count_z = high_z - C + 1\n\n        Then, total += count_x * count_z\n\n   Print total.\n\n However, let's test with the example: \"1 2 3 4\"\n\n   A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4\n\n   s ranges from 1+2=3 to 2+3=5.\n\n   s=3:\n        low_x = max(1, 3-3)=max(1,0)=1\n        high_x = min(2, 3-2)=min(2,1)=1\n        count_x=1\n        count_z: min(4, 2)=2 -> then z from 3 to 2 -> invalid (since 3>2). So count_z=0.\n\n   s=4:\n        low_x = max(1,4-3)=max(1,1)=1\n        high_x = min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2\n        count_x=2 (x can be 1 or 2, then y=3 or 2 respectively)\n        But note: when x=1, y=3 -> valid (since y=3 is in [B,C]=[2,3])\n                when x=2, y=2 -> valid (since y=2 is in [2,3])\n        Now, count_z: min(4,3)=3 -> z from 3 to 3: only 3 -> count_z=1\n        So add 2*1 = 2\n\n   s=5:\n        low_x = max(1,5-3)=max(1,2)=2\n        high_x = min(2,5-2)=min(2,3)=2\n        count_x=1 (x=2, y=3)\n        count_z: min(4,4)=4 -> z from 3 to 4: [3,4] -> count_z=2\n        So add 1*2 = 2\n\n   Total = 0 (for s=3) + 2 (for s=4) + 2 (for s=5) = 4.\n\n   This matches the first example.\n\n   Second example: \"1 2 2 5\"\n        A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5\n\n        s from 1+2=3 to 2+2=4.\n\n        s=3:\n            low_x = max(1, 3-2)=max(1,1)=1\n            high_x = min(2, 3-2)=min(2,1)=1\n            count_x=1\n            count_z: min(5,2)=2 -> z from 2 to 2 (since C=2) -> count_z=1\n            total += 1\n\n        s=4:\n            low_x = max(1,4-2)=max(1,2)=2\n            high_x = min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2\n            count_x=1\n            count_z: min(5,3)=3 -> z from 2 to 3: count_z=2\n            total += 1*2 = 2\n\n        Total = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n   But the example output is 3.\n\n   However, note the example input is \"1 2 2 5\", and the example output is 3.\n\n   But wait: the example says: \"In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides (1,2,2), (2,2,2) and (2,2,3).\"\n\n   Our method counts:\n        s=3: (x,y) = (1,2) -> then z must be < 3, and z>=2, so z=2 -> (1,2,2): valid.\n        s=4: (x,y)=(2,2) -> then z must be <4, so z from 2 to 3 -> (2,2,2) and (2,2,3)\n\n   That matches.\n\n   However, note: the example input has C=2, so y is in [B, C] = [2,2] (only y=2). But wait, in the first example s=3 we had y=2 (from x=1) and that is allowed because y=2 is in [2,2]. \n\n   But wait, what about x=1 and y=2? Then the side lengths are (1,2,2). Is that a valid triangle?\n        1+2>2 -> 3>2 -> yes.\n\n   Similarly, (2,2,2): 2+2>2 -> 4>2 -> yes.\n        (2,2,3): 2+2>3 -> 4>3 -> yes.\n\n   So it works.\n\n   But note: the example input was given as \"1 2 2 5\", and our program outputs 3.\n\n   However, note that the example input order is A, B, C, D. Our program uses:\n        A = 1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if the range for y is [B, C] and C=2, so y can only be 2. Then why did we get two pairs for s=3? Actually, we had one pair for s=3: (x=1, y=2). The other s=4: (x=2, y=2). \n\n   The issue is: the example input \"1 2 2 5\" has C=2, so y must be 2. Then the pairs (x,y) are:\n        x from [1,2] and y from [2,2] -> so (1,2) and (2,2). That's two pairs.\n\n   Then, for (1,2): z must be in [2, min(5, 1+2-1)] = [2, min(5,2)] = [2,2] -> one z: 2.\n        for (2,2): z must be in [2, min(5, 2+2-1)] = [2, min(5,3)] = [2,3] -> two z: 2 and 3.\n\n   So total triangles: 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n   Therefore, the code should work.\n\n   However, note: the condition for x and y: we have defined the range for y as [B, C] and we are using the same C for the upper bound of y. But note that the problem states: \"B<=y<=C\", and in the example C=2, so y must be between 2 and 2.\n\n   But wait, in the example input \"1 2 2 5\", the second example, the input is \"1 2 2 5\", meaning A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\n   However, the example says: \"In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides (1,2,2), (2,2,2) and (2,2,3).\" \n\n   But note: the example input is given as four integers: A, B, C, D.\n\n   We must read the input as four integers.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the range for y is [B, C] and we are using the same C that is provided. However, in the problem, the condition is \"B<=y<=C\", so if C < B, then there would be no y. But the input guarantees A<=B<=C<=D.\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   However, the worst-case: the s ranges from A+B to B+C, and the length of s is (B+C - A+B + 1) = (C - A + 1). The maximum C-A is 500000, so the loop runs about 500000 times, which is acceptable.\n\n   But wait: the maximum s is B+C, which can be up to 1000000, so we are iterating from A+B to B+C, which is about (B+C - A+B + 1) = (C - A + 1) iterations. Since A<=B<=C, the minimum A is 1 and maximum C is 500000, so the maximum number of iterations is 500000 (if A=1, then from 1+B to B+C, but the length is (B+C - (1+B) + 1) = C - 1 + 1 = C, which is 500000). So the loop runs at most 500000 times.\n\n   However, note: the s ranges from A+B to B+C, and the length is (B+C - A+B + 1) = (C - A + 1). But A can be as small as 1 and C as large as 500000, so the length is 500000. So worst-case 500000 iterations.\n\n   But wait, in the example with A=1, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000, then s from 1+500000=500001 to 500000+500000=1000000, so the length is 500000, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, note: the problem constraints say A,B,C,D up to 500000, so the maximum s is 1000000, and we are iterating from s_min = A+B (which is at least 2) to s_max = B+C (which is at most 1000000). The number of iterations is (s_max - s_min + 1) = (B+C - A-B + 1) = (C-A+1). And C-A can be up to 500000, so worst-case 500000 iterations.\n\n   But wait, actually: s_min = A+B, s_max = B+C, so the number of s values is (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = (C - A + 1). And since A<=C, then C-A is at least 0, and at most 500000. So we do about 500000 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, note that the inner operations are constant time, so total operations are O(C-A) which is acceptable.\n\n   But wait, the example \"500000 500000 500000 500000\" (third example):\n\n        A=B=C=D=500000.\n\n        Then s from 500000+500000=1000000 to 500000+500000=1000000 (only one s).\n\n        For s=1000000:\n            low_x = max(500000, 1000000-500000)=max(500000,500000)=500000\n            high_x = min(500000, 1000000-500000)=min(500000,500000)=500000\n            count_x=1\n\n            count_z: min(500000, 1000000-1)=500000, then z from 500000 to 500000 -> count_z=1\n\n        Total=1\n\n        Output is 1, which matches.\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as: ['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000'].\n\n   However, the example output is ['4','3','1'].\n\n   Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n   One more edge: what if the condition for x and y does not yield any pairs for a particular s? Then we skip.\n\n   Code:\n\n        Read A, B, C, D\n\n        s_min = A+B\n        s_max = B+C\n\n        total_triangles = 0\n\n        for s in range(s_min, s_max+1):\n            # Determine the range for x\n            low_x = max(A, s - C)\n            high_x = min(B, s - B)\n\n            if low_x <= high_x:\n                count_x = high_x - low_x + 1\n            else:\n                count_x = 0\n\n            # For the given s, determine the range for z\n            # z must be in [C, D] and z < s (so z <= s-1)\n            low_z = C\n            high_z = min(D, s-1)\n\n            if high_z < C:\n                count_z = 0\n            else:\n                count_z = high_z - C + 1\n\n            total_triangles += count_x * count_z\n\n        print(total_triangles)\n\n   However, wait: the condition for y is that y is in [B, C]. In our derivation, we used the constraint from y: x <= s-B and x>=s-C. This is equivalent to y>=B and y<=C. \n\n   But note: the condition for y is y = s-x, and we have set:\n        x >= s-C   => y = s-x <= C   (correct)\n        x <= s-B   => y = s-x >= B   (correct)\n\n   So the conditions are correctly captured.\n\n   But note: we must also ensure that y is at least B and at most C. We are doing that via the constraints on x.\n\n   However, there is a catch: the condition x>=A and x<=B is also enforced.\n\n   Therefore, the code above should be correct.\n\n   Let me test with a small example: A=1, B=3, C=3, D=10.\n\n        s_min = 1+3=4, s_max=3+3=6.\n\n        s=4:\n            low_x = max(1, 4-3)=max(1,1)=1\n            high_x = min(3, 4-3)=min(3,1)=1\n            count_x=1\n            count_z: min(10,3)=3 -> z from 3 to 3 -> 1\n            total=1\n\n        s=5:\n            low_x = max(1,5-3)=max(1,2)=2\n            high_x = min(3,5-3)=min(3,2)=2\n            count_x=1\n            count_z: min(10,4)=4 -> z from 3 to 4 -> 2\n            total=1+2=3\n\n        s=6:\n            low_x = max(1,6-3)=max(1,3)=3\n            high_x = min(3,6-3)=min(3,3)=3\n            count_x=1\n            count_z: min(10,5)=5 -> z from 3 to 5 -> 3\n            total=3+3=6\n\n        So total=1+2+3=6.\n\n        Now, let's enumerate:\n\n          x in [1,3], y in [3,3] (so y=3) and z in [3,10] but must satisfy x+y>z -> x+3>z.\n\n          For x=1: 1+3=4 -> z<4 -> z in [3,3] -> 1 triangle: (1,3,3)\n          For x=2: 2+3=5 -> z<5 -> z in [3,4] -> 2 triangles: (2,3,3) and (2,3,4)\n          For x=3: 3+3=6 -> z<6 -> z in [3,5] -> 3 triangles: (3,3,3), (3,3,4), (3,3,5)\n\n          Total: 1+2+3=6.\n\n        Correct.\n\n   However, note that the problem says \"non-degenerate triangles\", and the triangle inequality is strictly x+y>z. Our condition ensures that.\n\n   But wait: what if we have a triangle where two sides are equal and the third is larger? Actually, the triangle inequality requires the sum of the two smaller sides to be greater than the largest side. However, in our case, note that the sides are x, y, z and we have x<=y<=z? Not necessarily: we only have A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D. So x<=B<=y, and y<=C<=z. Therefore, we have x<=y<=z. Then the triangle inequality condition is automatically satisfied by the two smaller sides? Actually, the condition for a non-degenerate triangle is that the sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest side. But here, the sides are ordered: x<=y<=z. Then the condition becomes x+y>z.\n\n   So our condition is exactly the triangle condition.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\n\n        s_min = A + B\n        s_max = B + C\n\n        total = 0\n\n        for s in range(s_min, s_max+1):\n            # Constraints for x: \n            #   x >= max(A, s-C)\n            #   x <= min(B, s-B)\n\n            low_x = max(A, s - C)\n            high_x = min(B, s - B)\n\n            if low_x <= high_x:\n                count_x = high_x - low_x + 1\n            else:\n                count_x = 0\n\n            # For z: must be in [C, D] and < s (so <= s-1)\n            if s-1 < C:\n                count_z = 0\n            else:\n                high_z = min(D, s-1)\n                count_z = high_z - C + 1\n\n            total += count_x * count_z\n\n        print(total)\n\n   However, note: the condition for y is already enforced by the constraints on x (via the transformation y=s-x). But wait, we are not explicitly checking y. However, the constraints on x (from the equation y=s-x) and the original constraints for x (A<=x<=B) and the derived constraints from y (B<=y<=C) are incorporated in the calculation of low_x and high_x.\n\n   But note: the condition for y is that y>=B and y<=C, which is equivalent to x<=s-B and x>=s-C, and we are taking the intersection with [A,B]. So it is correct.\n\n   However, let me test with an example where s is such that the derived constraints on x are outside [A,B]. For instance, A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, and s=5 (which we did above) was okay.\n\n   But consider a different example: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, and s=3: we had x=1, then y=2. But wait, for s=3, we had:\n        low_x = max(1, 3-3)=1, high_x=min(2,3-2)=1 -> x=1, then y=2. And y=2 is in [B,C]=[2,3] -> valid.\n\n   Another example: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, and s=4: x from 1 to 2, then y=3 or 2. But when x=1, y=3 (valid); x=2, y=2 (valid).\n\n   Now, let's consider an example where the constraints on x from y are not satisfied: \n        Suppose A=1, B=2, C=4, D=10, and s=5.\n        Then, for y: y=5-x, and we require B<=y<=C -> 2<=5-x<=4 -> 2<=5-x and 5-x<=4.\n        From 5-x>=2 -> x<=3, and 5-x<=4 -> x>=1.\n\n        Now, x must be in [A,B]=[1,2]. So x in [max(1,5-4)=max(1,1)=1, min(2,5-2)=min(2,3)=2]. So x in [1,2].\n\n        Then for x=1, y=4 (valid: 4 is in [2,4]) -> then z must be <5, so z from 4 to min(10,4)=4 -> one z (4)\n        For x=2, y=3 (valid: 3 is in [2,4]) -> then z from 4 to min(10,4)=4 -> one z (4)\n\n        So two triangles: (1,4,4) and (2,3,4).\n\n        Now, check triangle condition: \n            (1,4,4): 1+4>4 -> 5>4 -> yes.\n            (2,3,4): 2+3>4 -> 5>4 -> yes.\n\n        Our code for s=5:\n            low_x = max(1,5-4)=1\n            high_x = min(2,5-2)=min(2,3)=2\n            count_x=2\n            count_z: min(10,4)=4, then z from 4 to 4 -> 1\n            total for s=5: 2*1=2.\n\n        Correct.\n\n   However, note: the above example is just one s. But what if s is too small? \n\n   Example: A=1, B=2, C=4, D=10, and s=3.\n        Then, x must be in [max(1,3-4)=max(1,-1)=1, min(2,3-2)=min(2,1)=1] -> x=1, then y=2 (valid because 2 is in [2,4]). Then z must be <3, so z from 4 to min(10,2) -> wait, 4>2, so count_z=0.\n\n        So no triangle for s=3.\n\n        Check: (1,2,z) must satisfy 1+2>z -> 3>z. But z>=4, so no solution.\n\n        Correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   But note: the condition for z is that z>=C and z<=min(D, s-1). Since s might be very small (like 3) and C might be 4, then indeed no z exists.\n\n   Let me run the code for the example above.\n\n   However, note: the s_min is A+B=1+2=3, so we start at s=3.\n\n   We'll do s=3,4,5,... until 2+4=6.\n\n   But wait, s_max = B+C=2+4=6.\n\n   s=3: count_x=1, count_z=0 -> 0\n   s=4: low_x = max(1,4-4)=max(1,0)=1, high_x=min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2 -> count_x=2\n         count_z: min(10,3)=3 -> but wait, 3 < C (which is 4)? Then count_z=0? \n         Actually, the condition for z: z must be at least C (which is 4) and at most min(10,3) -> 3, but 4>3, so no z. So count_z=0.\n\n   Then s=4: 0\n   s=5: 2 (as above)\n   s=6: low_x = max(1,6-4)=max(1,2)=2, high_x=min(2,6-2)=min(2,4)=2 -> count_x=1\n         count_z: min(10,5)=5 -> z from 4 to 5 -> 2\n         total for s=6: 1*2=2\n\n        Total=0+0+2+2=4.\n\n        Now, enumerate:\n\n          s=5: (1,4,4) and (2,3,4) -> two triangles.\n          s=6: x=2, y=4 -> (2,4,4) and (2,4,5) -> two triangles.\n\n        Check:\n          (1,4,4): 1+4>4 -> 5>4 -> ok.\n          (2,3,4): 2+3>4 -> 5>4 -> ok.\n          (2,4,4): 2+4>4 -> 6>4 -> ok.\n          (2,4,5): 2+4>5 -> 6>5 -> ok.\n\n        So 4 triangles.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the condition for z is that z>=C and z<=min(D, s-1). In the example s=6, C=4, so z from 4 to 5 (inclusive) -> 4,5 -> two numbers.\n\n   But wait, in s=5, we had z from 4 to 4 (only 4) -> one number.\n\n   But wait, in s=5, the condition for z is: z < s (5) and z>=4 -> [4,4] -> one number.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   We'll submit.\n\n   However, note: the problem constraints say that the numbers can be up to 500000, and we are iterating from s_min to s_max, which is (C-A+1) iterations. In worst-case, if A=1 and C=500000, then we iterate 500000 times. This is acceptable in Python if we do nothing heavy in the loop.\n\n   Let me test with worst-case: A=1, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000.\n\n        s_min=1+500000=500001, s_max=500000+500000=1000000.\n\n        Then the loop runs from 500001 to 1000000, which is 500000 iterations.\n\n        Each iteration does a few arithmetic operations.\n\n        This should be fast enough.\n\n   But wait, what if A=1, B=2, C=500000, D=500000? Then s_min=3, s_max=500002, which is 500000 iterations.\n\n   So worst-case 500000 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, note: the example input might have a wide range for s, but the number of iterations is (s_max-s_min+1) = (B+C - A-B + 1) = (C-A+1). \n\n   Since A<=C, the worst-case is when A is minimal (1) and C is maximal (500000), so 500000 iterations.\n\n   We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n   But wait, there is a possibility to optimize the counting by precomputing the counts for x for each s without a loop? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use mathematical formulas to count the pairs (x,y) for a given s. But the current method is already O(C-A) which is acceptable.\n\n   However, note that the constraints say the numbers can be up to 500000, so 500000 iterations is acceptable.\n\n   Let me run the code for the worst-case in my mind: 500000 iterations, each iteration does:\n\n        low_x = max(A, s-C)\n        high_x = min(B, s-B)\n\n        if low_x <=",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). The triangle must satisfy the non-degenerate condition \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires counting all possible triplets \\((x, y, z)\\) within specified ranges that form a non-degenerate triangle. The key observation is that for each valid pair \\((x, y)\\), the third side \\(z\\) must be less than \\(x + y\\) and lie within the range \\([C, D]\\).\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each possible sum \\(s = x + y\\) (where \\(x\\) ranges from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) and \\(y\\) ranges from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\)), we determine the number of valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) that sum to \\(s\\). Then, for each such sum, we count the number of valid \\(z\\) values in \\([C, \\min(D, s-1)]\\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Iterate over all possible sums \\(s\\) from \\(A + B\\) to \\(B + C\\).\n   - For each sum \\(s\\), compute the range of \\(x\\) values that satisfy \\(A \\leq x \\leq B\\) and \\(s - C \\leq x \\leq s - B\\). The number of valid \\(x\\) values is the intersection of these two intervals.\n   - For each valid \\(x\\), the corresponding \\(y\\) is \\(s - x\\), which automatically lies within \\([B, C]\\) due to our constraints on \\(x\\).\n   - The number of valid \\(z\\) values for each \\(s\\) is the count of integers in \\([C, \\min(D, s-1)]\\).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm iterates over \\(O(C - A)\\) possible sums \\(s\\), performing constant-time operations for each sum. Given that \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) can be up to \\(5 \\times 10^5\\), the worst-case complexity is \\(O(5 \\times 10^5)\\), which is efficient for the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    s_min = A + B\n    s_max = B + C\n    \n    total_triangles = 0\n\n    for s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n        low_x = max(A, s - C)\n        high_x = min(B, s - B)\n        \n        if low_x <= high_x:\n            count_x = high_x - low_x + 1\n        else:\n            count_x = 0\n            \n        upper_z = s - 1\n        if upper_z < C:\n            count_z = 0\n        else:\n            upper_z = min(D, upper_z)\n            count_z = upper_z - C + 1\n            \n        total_triangles += count_x * count_z\n        \n    print(total_triangles)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads four integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) from standard input.\n2. **Initial Setup**: It calculates the minimum and maximum possible sums \\(s = x + y\\) based on the given ranges for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n3. **Iterating Over Sums**: For each sum \\(s\\) from \\(s_{\\text{min}}\\) to \\(s_{\\text{max}}\\):\n   - **Determine Valid \\(x\\) Values**: The valid \\(x\\) values are those that satisfy both \\(A \\leq x \\leq B\\) and \\(s - C \\leq x \\leq s - B\\).
