A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n Steps:\n 1. Each bottle has `l` milliliters, so total drink = k * l.\n 2. Each lime is cut into `d` slices, so total lime slices = c * d.\n 3. Total salt = p grams.\n\n For each toast, each friend needs:\n   - nl milliliters of the drink (but note: the toast is for one friend? Actually, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for a toast. However, note that we are making toasts and all friends must drink the same amount.\n\n But note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for a toast.\n\n However, the catch: we are making toasts and each toast is consumed by one friend? Actually, the description says: \"To make a toast, each friend needs ...\". This means that for each toast that a friend makes (or partakes in), they require those items.\n\n But the friends are making toasts together and each friend must have the same number of toasts. So if we let t be the number of toasts per friend, then:\n\n   Total drink required = n * t * nl\n   Total lime slices required = n * t   (since each toast requires one slice per friend? Actually, wait: the toast requires one slice per friend? But then one toast by one friend would use one slice. However, the problem states: \"each friend needs ... a slice of lime\" for a toast. So if there are n friends and each makes t toasts, then each friend uses t slices, so total slices = n * t.\n\n However, note: the example input: \n   \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n   Drink: 4*5=20 ml -> 20/(3*3) = 20/9 -> not matching.\n\n Let's re-read the example: \n   \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n   Then: min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\n Explanation in the example: \n   They are making 6 toasts from the drink (because each toast requires 3 ml? Actually, wait: the example says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\", and nl is given as 3 in the first sample.\n\n But note: the example input: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n Here, nl=3. So one toast for one friend requires 3 ml? Then for one toast for one friend, we need 3 ml. However, the example says: \"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\". \n\n However, note: the toasts are for the entire group? Or per friend?\n\n The problem states: \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for a toast. So if we want to make t toasts per friend, then the total drink required is n * t * nl.\n\n But the example calculation: \n   They say: 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\n\n This 6 toasts is the total toasts for the entire group? Because if each toast is for one friend, then the total number of toasts (counting each friend's toast separately) is 6. Then since there are 3 friends, each friend can only have 6/3 = 2 toasts.\n\n So the steps:\n\n 1. Calculate the maximum number of toasts from the drink: total_drink = k * l; each toast requires nl per friend? But wait, the example considers that 3 ml (nl) is required for one toast (for one friend). So the total toasts (if we consider the entire group) is actually: total_drink // (nl * n) ? \n\n However, the example does: 20 / 3 = 6. Why 3? Because nl is 3 (the requirement per friend per toast). But note: the example does not multiply by the number of friends. \n\n Let me clarify: \n   In the example, they have 20 ml. Each toast (for one friend) requires 3 ml. But if we are making toasts for the entire group, then one toast (for the entire group) would require 3 * n ml? \n\n Alternatively, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for a toast. So if we are making one toast (meaning one round of toasting) for the entire group, then each friend drinks one toast's worth,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the maximum number of toasts based on the constraints of drink, lime slices, and salt, then divide by the number of friends to ensure everyone drinks the same amount.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, one lime slice, and a certain amount of salt per friend.\n2. **Key Insight**: The limiting factors are the total available drink, lime slices, and salt. We calculate how many toasts can be made from each resource:\n   - **Drink**: Total milliliters divided by (number of friends multiplied by milliliters per toast per friend).\n   - **Lime Slices**: Total slices (from c limes cut into d slices each) divided by the number of friends (since each toast requires one slice per friend).\n   - **Salt**: Total grams divided by (number of friends multiplied by grams per toast per friend).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves computing the minimum value among the three calculated toasts (from drink, lime, and salt) and then dividing by the number of friends. This ensures all friends can partake equally in the toasts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    \n    toasts_from_drink = total_drink // (nl * n)\n    toasts_from_lime = total_lime_slices // n\n    toasts_from_salt = p // (np * n)\n    \n    answer = min(toasts_from_drink, toasts_from_lime, toasts_from_salt)\n    print(answer)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, limes, slices per lime, salt, milliliters per toast per friend, and grams of salt per toast per friend.\n2. **Calculating Resources**: \n   - **Total Drink**: Multiplied to get the total milliliters available.\n   - **Total Lime Slices**: Multiplied to get the total slices from all limes.\n3. **Determining Toasts per Resource**:\n   - **Drink**: Divided by the product of friends and milliliters per toast per friend.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Divided by the number of friends (since each toast requires one slice per friend).\n   - **Salt**: Divided by the product of friends and grams per toast per friend.\n4. **Finding Minimum Toasts**: The smallest value among the three calculations gives the maximum number of toasts that can be made without exceeding any resource constraint.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the number of toasts each friend can make equally. \n\nThis approach efficiently checks all constraints and ensures fair distribution among friends, providing the correct solution for the problem.",
