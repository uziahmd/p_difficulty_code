    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\nWe are given two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). We need to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a+k) and (b+k) is minimized.\n\nLet d = a - b (if we assume without loss of generality that a <= b, but note: we might have negative differences). However, note that the problem does not specify which is larger. So we can assume without loss of generality that a <= b? Actually, we can also consider symmetry.\n\nBut note: if we set x = a+k and y = b+k, then we have x-y = a-b (constant). So the problem becomes: given two numbers with fixed difference d (which can be positive or negative), find k (non-negative) to minimize LCM(x, y) = LCM(a+k, b+k).\n\nNote: LCM(x,y) = |x*y| / GCD(x,y). Since x and y are positive (as k>=0 and a,b>=1), we can write LCM(x,y) = (x*y) / GCD(x,y).\n\nBut note: x = a+k, y = b+k, so x-y = a-b (if a>=b then x>=y, else if a<b then x<y). Without loss of generality, we can assume a<=b, then x<=y and the difference d = b-a (positive) is fixed.\n\nHowever, note that the problem does not require us to fix the order. But observe: the LCM is symmetric in x and y, so we can assume a<=b without loss of generality by swapping if necessary.\n\nBut wait: what if a > b? Then we can set x = b+k, y = a+k, and the difference is negative. But note that LCM(x,y) is symmetric. So we can assume a<=b by swapping if needed. However, the problem says \"two integers a and b\", so we must handle both.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the condition is symmetric in the sense that the problem does not change if we swap a and b. However, the k we get might be different if we swap, but note: the LCM condition is symmetric. Actually, the set of k that minimizes the LCM is independent of the order? Not exactly, because if we swap, the numbers become (b+k) and (a+k). But the LCM is the same. Therefore, we can assume without loss of generality that a <= b.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"If there are multiple optimal integers k, he needs to choose the smallest one.\" So we have to consider all k, but the LCM value for k and for some other k' might be the same even if we swap.\n\nActually, the problem is symmetric in the sense that if we swap a and b, the answer k remains the same? Let me test with the example: [6,10] -> k=2. If we swap [10,6], then we are looking for k such that LCM(10+k,6+k) is minimized. For k=2: LCM(12,8)=24. Now, if we try k=0: LCM(10,6)=30; k=1: LCM(11,7)=77; k=2:24; k=3: LCM(13,9)=117 -> so indeed k=2 is still the best. So the answer is symmetric.\n\nTherefore, we can assume a <= b (so that the difference d = b - a >= 0). Then we have x = a+k, y = b+k, and d = y-x = b-a.\n\nNow, note that LCM(x,y) = (x * y) / GCD(x,y). And GCD(x,y) divides d (because GCD(x,y) divides any linear combination, and in particular, GCD(x,y) divides y-x = d). So the GCD(x,y) must be a divisor of d.\n\nSo the idea: the GCD(x,y) is a divisor g of d. Then we can set g as a divisor of d, and then we require that g divides both x and y, i.e., g divides (a+k) and (b+k). Since g divides d (which is b-a), and also divides (a+k) and (b+k), then we have:\n\na+k ≡ 0 (mod g)   =>   k ≡ (-a) mod g\nSimilarly, since g divides d, and we know g divides (a+k) and (b+k) then k must satisfy k ≡ (-a) mod g and k ≡ (-b) mod g. But note that since g divides (b-a) = d, then -a mod g and -b mod g are congruent modulo g? Actually, because (b-a) mod g is 0, then (-a) mod g and (-b) mod g are the same? \n\nWait: \n  (b-a) % g == 0  =>  b % g = a % g, so -a ≡ -b (mod g). Therefore, the two congruences are the same: k ≡ (-a) mod g.\n\nSo for each divisor g of d (where d = b-a, and if d==0 then we have a=b and then we are looking for k that minimizes LCM(a+k, a+k) = a+k. Then the minimum is at k=0, because as k increases the LCM increases), we can set k_min(g) = the smallest non-negative k such that k ≡ (-a) mod g, i.e., k_min(g) = (g - a % g) % g.\n\nBut note: we can also consider divisors of |d| (since divisors are positive). Also, note that d can be zero (when a==b). So we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: a == b.\nThen d = 0. The equation becomes: we want to minimize LCM(a+k, a+k) = a+k. This is minimized when k=0.\n\nCase 2: a != b. Then d = |a-b| (we assumed a<=b, so d = b-a). Then we consider every divisor g of d (including 1 and d). For each divisor g, we compute k0(g) = (g - a % g) % g. Then the candidate k for this divisor is k0(g). Then we compute the LCM for candidate k0(g): LCM(a+k0(g), b+k0(g)) = (a+k0(g) * b+k0(g)) / g. But note: GCD(a+k0(g), b+k0(g)) = g (by construction). Then LCM = (a+k0(g) * b+k0(g)) / g.\n\nHowever, note: we don't know if the minimal LCM is achieved only by divisors of d? Actually, yes, because the GCD must divide d. So we must consider all divisors of d.\n\nBut wait: is it possible that the GCD is a divisor of d? Yes, because GCD(x,y) divides (x-y) = d.\n\nSo the plan:\n1. If a == b, output 0.\n\n2. Otherwise, set d = abs(a-b) (but actually we assumed a<=b, so d = b-a). But note: we can do without assuming: let d = abs(a-b). Then the divisors we consider are the divisors of d.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require to consider negative divisors, and divisors are positive.\n\nSteps:\n\n- Let d = abs(a-b)\n- Find all divisors of d (both positive and negative? no, divisors are positive). Actually, we consider positive divisors.\n\nBut note: the divisor g must be positive, and we are only considering positive divisors.\n\nThen, for each divisor g of d (including 1 and d):\n\n   k_candidate = (g - a % g) % g   [This gives the smallest non-negative k such that (a+k) % g == 0]\n\nBut note: we must also consider that k must be non-negative. The expression (g - a % g) % g gives a non-negative number.\n\nHowever, we must also consider: what if the divisor g is greater than d? Then we have already considered all divisors (since divisors are factors of d, and they are <= d). So we only consider divisors up to d.\n\nBut note: we must consider all divisors of d, including those that are greater than sqrt(d) but we can use a loop from 1 to sqrt(d) to get all divisors.\n\nBut wait: what if d is very large? The number of divisors is about O(sqrt(d)), which is acceptable because d <= 10^9, so sqrt(d) is about 10^4.5, which is around 31622. That is acceptable in Python if we do it efficiently.\n\nBut note: we must also consider the possibility that the minimal LCM might be achieved at k=0, or k being the divisor itself? \n\nHowever, there is a catch: sometimes k_candidate might be negative? Our formula (g - a%g) % g ensures non-negativity.\n\nBut note: the modulus operation for negative a%g: In Python, a % g is always non-negative (if g is positive). So if a is negative, then a%g is computed as: a % g = (a // g * g) + a_remainder, but we are given a>=1, so no problem.\n\nBut wait: our assumption was a<=b, but if we didn't assume, then we set d = abs(a-b). However, the problem does not specify which is larger. So we should set d = abs(a-b) and then consider the divisors of d.\n\nBut note: the condition on the GCD: the GCD must divide d. So even if we don't assume a<=b, the divisors of d (which is positive) are the same.\n\nHowever, note: the k_candidate formula uses a. But if we don't assume a<=b, then we must use the original a. But we defined d = abs(a-b). Then the congruence condition is: we require that (a+k) is divisible by g. But note: the GCD condition is symmetric. Alternatively, we can define d = b-a (if we assume a<=b) or a-b (if a>b) but then we take absolute value.\n\nBut wait: the difference is fixed, and the divisors of the absolute difference are the same. However, the condition for k is: k ≡ (-a) mod g. This is independent of the sign of d? Actually, the sign of d doesn't matter because we are taking divisors of |d|.\n\nBut note: the divisors we are considering are positive, and the condition k ≡ (-a) mod g is defined for positive g.\n\nSo we can do:\n\nLet d = abs(a-b)\n\nBut note: if a==b, we handled separately.\n\nNow, the candidate k values are:\n\n  k0 = 0   (always a candidate, because k=0 is allowed)\n\nBut wait: we are iterating over divisors of d. However, k=0 might not be captured by any divisor? Actually, if we consider divisor g=1, then k0 = (1 - a%1) % 1. But note: a%1 is 0, so (1-0)%1 = 1 % 1 = 0. So k=0 is included.\n\nBut note: there might be divisors that are not factors of the entire d? No, we are considering all divisors of d.\n\nBut wait: what if the minimal LCM is achieved by a k that is not necessarily making the GCD equal to a divisor of d? Actually, no: the GCD must divide d. So we are covering all possibilities.\n\nHowever, there is an alternative: the problem can be transformed. We have:\n\n  LCM(a+k, b+k) = (a+k)*(b+k) / GCD(a+k, b+k)\n\nAnd the GCD(a+k, b+k) must divide (b+k - (a+k)) = (b-a). So yes, it must divide d.\n\nBut note: the GCD might not be exactly a divisor of d? It is a divisor of d, so we are covering all possibilities.\n\nBut wait: there is an important point: the candidate k we get from divisor g is the smallest non-negative k such that g divides both (a+k) and (b+k). However, note that the GCD might be a multiple of g? Actually, no: the GCD is the greatest common divisor. But we are constructing k such that g divides both, so the GCD will be at least g. But note: the GCD could be a multiple of g? Actually, no: we are setting k so that g divides both, but the GCD might be greater than g. However, we are iterating over all divisors g of d, and the GCD must be a divisor of d, so we are going to capture the same k from the divisor that is the actual GCD.\n\nBut wait: we are constructing k for every divisor g of d. However, the same k might be generated by multiple divisors. But note: the condition for k is k ≡ (-a) mod g. If g1 and g2 are divisors of d and g1 divides g2, then the condition k ≡ (-a) mod g1 implies k ≡ (-a) mod g2? Not necessarily. Actually, if g1 divides g2, then the condition k ≡ (-a) mod g1 is a weaker condition than k ≡ (-a) mod g2.\n\nBut note: we are generating k for each divisor independently. However, we are only concerned with the minimal k that satisfies the condition for a divisor g. But the minimal k for a larger divisor g might be larger than the minimal k for a smaller divisor g.\n\nBut note: the problem requires the smallest k that minimizes the LCM. So we must check all divisors and then choose the k that gives the minimal LCM, and if two k give the same LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\nHowever, note: the same k might be generated by multiple divisors. But we don't care, because we are going to compute the LCM for each candidate k and then compare.\n\nBut wait: we cannot iterate over all divisors and then for each divisor compute the LCM (because the LCM might be huge, and we are comparing LCMs for large numbers). However, we don't need to compute the exact LCM for each candidate k, because the LCM for candidate k is (a+k)*(b+k)/g, and g is the GCD (which we set as the divisor we used). But wait, is g the GCD? Actually, we set k so that g divides both (a+k) and (b+k). But the actual GCD might be greater than g. Therefore, we cannot assume that the GCD is g.\n\nThis is a critical point.\n\nExample: \n  Let a=6, b=10, d=4. Divisors: 1,2,4.\n  For g=1: k0 = (1 - 6%1)%1 = (1-0)%1 = 0. Then the numbers are 6 and 10. GCD(6,10)=2, so LCM(6,10)=30. But if we use g=1, we are computing (6*10)/1 = 60, which is not the actual LCM.\n\nSo we must compute the actual GCD for the candidate k, then compute the LCM.\n\nBut note: the GCD of (a+k) and (b+k) must divide d. And the candidate k we found for divisor g is the smallest k such that g divides (a+k) and (b+k). However, the GCD might be a multiple of g (but then that multiple must divide d). But note: if we set k so that g divides (a+k) and (b+k), then the GCD will be at least g, and we know the GCD divides d, so the GCD must be a divisor of d and a multiple of g.\n\nBut then how do we compute the LCM? We can compute the GCD for the candidate k and then the LCM.\n\nBut note: the candidate k we found is the smallest k for which g divides (a+k). However, the GCD might be larger. So the LCM we get is (a+k)*(b+k) / gcd_value, and gcd_value might be larger than g.\n\nBut we are iterating over divisors of d. Why would we consider g=1,2,4 for the example? \n\nFor k=0 (from g=1): \n   numbers: 6,10 -> GCD=2, LCM= (6*10)/2 = 30.\n\nFor k=2 (from g=2): \n   numbers: 8,12 -> GCD=4, LCM=(8*12)/4=24.\n\nFor k= (from g=4): \n   k0 = (4 - 6%4) %4 = (4-2)%4=2. So k=2, which we already have.\n\nBut wait, for g=4 we got k=2 again. Then we would compute the same LCM as above.\n\nBut note: we are generating k from each divisor. Some k might be repeated.\n\nHow do we avoid duplicate k? We don't have to, because we are going to record the minimal LCM and the k that achieves it. But we must ensure that we compute the actual GCD for each candidate k.\n\nBut note: the candidate k we generate from divisor g is the minimal k for which g divides (a+k). However, the same k might be generated by multiple divisors (like k=2 is generated by g=2 and g=4). Then we would compute the LCM twice for k=2. That is inefficient if we have many divisors.\n\nBut the number of divisors is O(sqrt(d)), and d <= 10^9, so maximum divisors is around 1344 (for highly composite numbers). We can store the candidate k's in a set to avoid duplicates, but then we have to compute the LCM for each distinct k.\n\nBut note: the problem says that if there are multiple k giving the same LCM, we choose the smallest k. So we are required to consider each distinct k.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe know that the GCD must be a divisor of d. Let g be the GCD of (a+k) and (b+k). Then g divides d. Then we can iterate over divisors g of d, and for each divisor g, we require that g divides (a+k) and (b+k). The minimal k for which g divides (a+k) is k0 = (g - a%g) % g.\n\nBut then, the actual GCD might be a multiple of g (and divisor of d). However, we are not forced to use the divisor g as the GCD. We are just ensuring that g divides both numbers.\n\nBut note: the LCM is (a+k)*(b+k)/g', where g' is the GCD. We cannot avoid computing the GCD for the candidate k.\n\nBut wait: we can compute the GCD for candidate k without knowing the divisor? Yes, we can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nSo the plan:\n\n1. If a == b: print 0.\n\n2. Else:\n   d = abs(a-b)\n   Find all divisors of d (positive ones).\n\n   candidate_ks = set()\n   For each divisor g in divisors:\n        k0 = (g - a % g) % g\n        candidate_ks.add(k0)\n\n   Also, we must consider k=0? Actually, we did: when g=1, k0=0.\n\n   Then, we also have to consider that the minimal k might not necessarily be one of these? Actually, no: because the GCD must divide d, and we are generating k0 for every divisor g of d. But note: the GCD for the candidate k might be a divisor of d that is not necessarily the same as the divisor we used. However, we are generating the candidate k that makes sure that the divisor g divides both numbers, and then we compute the actual GCD (which is the GCD of the two numbers). \n\n   But wait: what if we don't get the minimal LCM by using a divisor that is a divisor of d? Actually, we are covering all divisors, so the GCD (which is a divisor of d) will be one of the divisors we consider. However, we are generating k for each divisor, and then the actual GCD for that k might be a divisor we haven't considered? No, because the GCD must divide d, so it is one of the divisors we considered. But note: we are generating k for divisor g, and then the actual GCD might be a divisor g' (which is a multiple of g and divides d). But we are not generating k for g' from g? \n\n   Example: \n        a=6, b=10, d=4. Divisors: [1,2,4].\n        For divisor g=1: we get k0=0, then the GCD is 2 (which is divisor 2).\n        For divisor g=2: we get k0=2, then the GCD is 4 (which is divisor 4).\n        For divisor g=4: we get k0=2, then the GCD is 4.\n\n   How do we capture the fact that k0=0 gives a GCD of 2? We don't need to, because we are going to compute the LCM for k0=0 and k0=2. \n\n   However, the problem is that we are generating candidate k's from divisors, but the same k might be generated by multiple divisors and we are storing them in a set.\n\n   Then, we must consider that the minimal k might come from a divisor that is not the actual GCD, but that is okay because we are going to compute the LCM for that k.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let S = set of candidate k's (from all divisors).\n\n   Then, we must consider: is there a possibility that the minimal LCM is achieved by a k that is not in S? \n\n   Consider: the GCD must divide d, so the condition for k is that the GCD divides d. Then the k must satisfy that the GCD divides (a+k). But the GCD must be one of the divisors of d. Therefore, the k we are generating (the minimal k for each divisor) are the minimal k that make the GCD at least that divisor. But note: the GCD might be larger than the divisor we used, but we are generating k for every divisor. However, we are missing the k's that are generated by divisors that are the actual GCD? \n\n   Actually, no: the candidate k for divisor g is the minimal k such that g divides (a+k). Then the actual GCD is the greatest common divisor, which is at least g. But note: we are generating k for every divisor, so we are generating k that make the GCD at least 1, at least 2, ... up to d.\n\n   However, note: if we consider divisor g, we are getting the minimal k that makes the GCD divisible by g. But the GCD might be a divisor that is not g but a multiple of g (and divides d). And we are generating the same k for multiples of g? \n\n   Actually, we are generating k for every divisor, including the multiples. But note: if g1 and g2 are divisors and g1 divides g2, then the condition for g2 implies the condition for g1. Therefore, the minimal k for g2 is at least as large as the minimal k for g1. \n\n   But we are storing all k's in a set, so we are not missing any candidate k.\n\n   However, the problem is: we must consider k=0 as well as k=2, etc.\n\n   But note: the set S might contain many k's. Then, we must compute for each k in S:\n\n        x = a+k\n        y = b+k\n        g_actual = gcd(x, y)\n        lcm_val = (x * y) // g_actual\n\n   Then we choose the k that minimizes lcm_val, and if there are multiple, choose the smallest k.\n\n   However, note: the set S might be large (number of divisors is about 1344, so set size <= 1344). Then we can do:\n\n        candidates = sorted(S)   # sort by k\n\n        best_k = None\n        best_lcm = None\n\n        for k in candidates:\n            x = a+k\n            y = b+k\n            g = math.gcd(x, y)\n            current_lcm = (x * y) // g\n\n            if best_lcm is None or current_lcm < best_lcm or (current_lcm == best_lcm and k < best_k):\n                best_lcm = current_lcm\n                best_k = k\n\n        print(best_k)\n\n   But wait: is that correct?\n\n   Example: a=6, b=10, d=4.\n\n   Divisors: [1,2,4] -> candidate k: \n        g=1: k0 = (1-6%1)%1 -> 0\n        g=2: k0 = (2-6%2)%2 = (2-0)%2=0? Wait, 6%2=0, so (2-0)%2=2%2=0. But wait, that gives k=0 for divisor 2? \n\n   Let me recalc: \n        For divisor g=2: we require (a+k) % 2 == 0 -> 6+k %2 ==0. Since 6 is even, k must be even. The smallest non-negative k is 0.\n\n        But wait, then for divisor g=2, k0=0. Then we are generating k=0 again.\n\n        Then for divisor g=4: k0 = (4 - 6%4)%4 = (4-2)%4=2.\n\n        So the set S = {0,2}. Then we compute:\n\n            k=0: x=6, y=10 -> gcd=2, lcm= (6*10)//2 = 30.\n            k=2: x=8, y=12 -> gcd=4, lcm= (8*12)//4 = 24.\n\n        Then we choose k=2.\n\n   But wait, the example output is 2.\n\n   However, note: the example input is [6,10] -> k=2.\n\n   Another example: [21,31] -> output 9.\n\n   Let me test with [21,31]:\n        d = 10, divisors: 1,2,5,10.\n\n        k0 for each divisor (using a=21):\n\n          g=1: k0 = (1-21%1)%1 = 0\n          g=2: k0 = (2-21%2)%2 = (2-1)%2 = 1\n          g=5: k0 = (5-21%5)%5 = (5-1)%5 = 4\n          g=10: k0 = (10-21%10)%10 = (10-1)%10 = 9\n\n        Then candidate k's: {0,1,4,9}\n\n        Now compute LCM for each:\n\n          k=0: x=21, y=31 -> gcd(21,31)=1, lcm=21*31=651.\n          k=1: x=22, y=32 -> gcd(22,32)=2, lcm=(22*32)//2 = 352.\n          k=4: x=25, y=35 -> gcd(25,35)=5, lcm=(25*35)//5 = 175.\n          k=9: x=30, y=40 -> gcd(30,40)=10, lcm=(30*40)//10 = 120.\n\n        Then the minimal LCM is 120 at k=9. So output 9.\n\n   Another example: [5,10] -> output 0.\n\n        d=5, divisors: 1,5.\n\n        k0 for g=1: 0\n        k0 for g=5: (5-5%5)%5 = (5-0)%5=0.\n\n        Then candidate k={0}.\n\n        k=0: x=5, y=10 -> gcd=5, lcm=(5*10)//5=10.\n\n        Output 0.\n\n   But wait: the example input [5,10] gives output 0.\n\n   However, note: the example input ['6 10','21 31','5 10'] gives output ['2','9','0'].\n\n   But wait: the example [5,10] is already handled.\n\n   However, note: the above method generates candidate k's from divisors of d. But note: the problem statement says that k must be non-negative. Our k0 is non-negative.\n\n   But is it possible that the minimal k is not in S? \n\n   Consider: the condition for k is that the GCD must divide d. Then the minimal k for which the GCD is a divisor g is k0. But note: the GCD might be a divisor that is not considered? No, because we are iterating over all divisors.\n\n   However, note: the condition for k is that the GCD divides d, so the k must be such that the GCD is one of the divisors. Then the minimal k for which the GCD is a divisor g is k0. But note: there might be a k that is not the minimal one for divisor g but has a GCD that is a divisor (and maybe even a larger divisor) and yields a lower LCM? \n\n   Example: let's say we have a=10, b=15, d=5. Divisors: 1,5.\n\n        k0 for g=1: 0 -> (10,15): gcd=5, lcm= (10*15)//5=30.\n        k0 for g=5: (5-10%5)%5=0 -> same.\n\n        Then the candidate set is {0}. But what if k=5?\n            (10+5,15+5) = (15,20): gcd=5, lcm= (15*20)//5=60 -> worse.\n\n        What if k=1: (11,16): gcd=1, lcm=176 -> worse.\n\n        k=2: (12,17): gcd=1, lcm=204 -> worse.\n\n        k=3: (13,18): gcd=1, lcm=234 -> worse.\n\n        k=4: (14,19): gcd=1, lcm=266 -> worse.\n\n        k=5: 60, as above.\n\n        So k=0 is the best.\n\n   But wait, what if we have a=2, b=4, d=2. Divisors: 1,2.\n\n        k0 for g=1: 0 -> (2,4): gcd=2, lcm= (2*4)//2=4.\n        k0 for g=2: (2-2%2)%2 = (2-0)%2=0.\n\n        Then candidate set {0}. \n\n        Now, what if k=2? \n            (4,6): gcd=2, lcm=(4*6)//2=12 -> worse.\n\n        But wait, is there a k=1?\n            (3,5): gcd=1, lcm=15 -> worse.\n\n        So k=0 is best.\n\n   However, note: the above method did not consider k=1 because 1 is not a divisor of d (d=2) and 1 is a divisor? Actually, yes, divisors of 2 are 1 and 2. So we did consider g=1, and k0=0.\n\n   But wait, the candidate k=1 is not generated by any divisor? Because the condition for divisor g=1: k0=0, and for divisor g=2: k0=0. So we don't generate k=1. \n\n   However, note: the condition for divisor g=1: k0=0 is the minimal k such that 1 divides (a+k) and (b+k). But 1 divides everything, so k0=0 is the minimal k for divisor 1. Similarly, divisor 2 requires k0=0.\n\n   But why didn't we get k=1? Because the condition for divisor g=1 is automatically satisfied for every k. But we are only generating the minimal k for each divisor, and for divisor 1 the minimal k is 0.\n\n   However, the problem requires the minimal k that minimizes the LCM. It is possible that for a divisor g, we are not forced to use the minimal k for that divisor. We could use a larger k that might yield a lower LCM? \n\n   Example: a=2, b=4, d=2.\n\n        We considered k=0: LCM=4.\n\n        What if k=1? LCM= (3,5)=15 -> worse.\n\n        k=2: (4,6)=12 -> worse.\n\n        So no.\n\n   But consider: a=3, b=5, d=2.\n\n        Divisors: 1,2.\n\n        k0 for g=1: 0 -> (3,5): gcd=1, lcm=15.\n        k0 for g=2: (2-3%2)%2 = (2-1)%2=1 -> k=1: (4,6): gcd=2, lcm= (4*6)//2=12.\n\n        Then we choose k=1.\n\n        Is there a k=0? yes, but LCM=15 -> worse than 12.\n\n        Is there a k=2? (5,7): gcd=1, lcm=35 -> worse.\n\n        So k=1 is the minimal.\n\n   Now, consider a=3, b=7, d=4.\n\n        Divisors: 1,2,4.\n\n        k0 for g=1: 0 -> (3,7): gcd=1, lcm=21.\n        k0 for g=2: (2-3%2)%2 = (2-1)%2=1 -> k=1: (4,8): gcd=4, lcm= (4*8)//4=8.\n        k0 for g=4: (4-3%4)%4 = (4-3)%4=1 -> k=1.\n\n        Then candidate set: {0,1}.\n\n        k=0: LCM=21.\n        k=1: LCM=8.\n\n        So answer=1.\n\n   But wait: is there a k=2? (5,9): gcd=1, LCM=45 -> worse.\n        k=3: (6,10): gcd=2, LCM= (6*10)//2=30 -> worse.\n\n   So it works.\n\n   However, note: the above method only considers the minimal k for each divisor. But is it possible that a divisor g requires k0, but then a multiple of k0 (k0 + t*g) might yield a lower LCM? \n\n   Example: a=3, b=7, d=4. \n        k0 for divisor 2 is 1, so the next k that satisfies divisor 2 is 1, 3, 5, ... \n        We only took k=1, but what if k=3 (which is 1+2)? \n            (6,10): gcd=2, LCM=30 -> worse than 8.\n\n        k=5: (8,12): gcd=4, LCM=24 -> worse.\n\n   So it seems that the minimal k for a divisor g gives the smallest value for (a+k) and (b+k) that are divisible by g, so the product (a+k)*(b+k) is minimized for that divisor condition. But note: the LCM is (a+k)*(b+k)/gcd, and the gcd might be larger than g, so the denominator is larger. However, we are not sure.\n\n   But note: we are iterating over divisors, and the minimal k for each divisor is the first time the condition holds. Then the product (a+k)*(b+k) is minimized for that divisor condition. However, the actual GCD might be larger, so the LCM might be smaller than expected. But we are computing the actual GCD, so it is okay.\n\n   However, the problem: the candidate set S is built from the minimal k for each divisor. But note: there might be a k that is not minimal for any divisor but still the LCM is lower? \n\n   Let me think: the condition for k is that the GCD divides d. Therefore, the GCD is one of the divisors. Then the minimal k that achieves a particular GCD (say h) is the minimal k such that h divides (a+k) and (b+k). And we are generating k for every divisor h (which is the GCD). But note: the",
