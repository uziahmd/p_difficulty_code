Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem.\n\n We are given two points (home and university) and n lines (roads). The roads divide the plane into blocks. We can move from one block to another if they share a nonzero length border. This means we can only cross a road at a time (since crossing a road is the only way to move from one block to another, and the step is defined by moving across a shared border of nonzero length).\n\n However, note that the problem does not require us to simulate the movement through the plane. Instead, we can think combinatorially:\n\n Observation:\n Each road divides the plane into two half-planes. The home and university are located in some blocks. The key observation is that two blocks are adjacent (and thus one step can be taken) if and only if they differ in exactly one road's side.\n\n But note: the movement is defined by crossing a road. Therefore, to go from the home block to the university block, we must cross a set of roads. However, note that if two blocks are separated by multiple roads, we might need to cross each separating road at least once. However, the problem allows moving from one block to an adjacent one (crossing one road) and then from there to another, etc.\n\n Actually, we can model the problem as follows:\n\n Each road gives a linear equation: a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i = 0.\n For a point (x,y), we can define the sign for each road: \n   s_i = sign(a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i)\n\n Then, the block containing the home is characterized by the tuple (s_1, s_2, ..., s_n) where each s_i is either positive or negative (we can choose arbitrarily, say 1 for positive and -1 for negative).\n\n Similarly, the university is in a block with its own tuple (t_1, t_2, ..., t_n).\n\n Now, two blocks are adjacent if their tuples differ in exactly one coordinate. Therefore, the minimum number of steps is the minimum number of road crossings required to go from the home block to the university block.\n\n But note: when you cross a road, the sign for that road flips. So the path from home to university requires flipping the coordinates that are different between the two sign tuples.\n\n However, we cannot flip arbitrary roads arbitrarily? Actually, we can cross roads in any order. But note: if two blocks are separated by k roads (i.e., their sign tuples differ in k positions), then we must cross at least k roads. However, the problem says that we can move from one block to an adjacent one (so one road) and then from there to another, etc. \n\n But wait: is it always the case that the minimum number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two blocks (the Hamming distance between the two sign tuples)? \n\n Let me explain:\n\n Consider: if two blocks differ in k roads, then we must cross those k roads. However, we can cross them one by one. But note: when you cross a road, you change one sign. To get from the home block to the university block, we must change the signs for all the roads where the home and university have opposite sides. However, sometimes crossing one road might make the block adjacent to one that is closer to the university? Actually, no: because the roads are independent, the minimal path is just the number of roads that separate the two.\n\n However, consider: what if by crossing one road, we might be able to fix two differences at once? Actually, no: because each road is independent and the sign changes are independent. The minimal number of crossings is the number of roads for which the two points lie on opposite sides.\n\n But wait: the problem says that we can only move to an adjacent block (sharing a border of nonzero length). And adjacent blocks differ in exactly one road. Therefore, we must change one sign at a time. Hence, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two blocks (i.e., the number of i such that the sign of (a_i*x1+b_i*y1+c_i) is different from the sign of (a_i*x2+b_i*y2+c_i)).\n\n However, let's test with the example:\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: \n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        2\n        0 1 0\n        1 0 0\n\n   This means two roads: the vertical line x=0 and the horizontal line y=0.\n\n   Home: (1,1) -> for road1 (0*x+1*y+0=0): y=0 -> 1>0 -> positive. For road2 (1*x+0*y+0=0): x=0 -> 1>0 -> positive.\n   University: (-1,-1) -> for road1: y=-1 -> negative.",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing the university, given that each step involves crossing a road (a line) that separates two adjacent blocks. The key observation here is that each road divides the plane into two half-planes, and the movement between blocks is only possible by crossing these roads. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The home and university are located in different blocks separated by certain roads. Each road can be represented by the equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\). For any point not on the road, we can determine which side of the road it lies on by evaluating the sign of \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\).\n2. **Key Insight**: The minimal number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equal to the number of roads that separate the two blocks. Two blocks are separated by a road if the home and university lie on opposite sides of that road.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, check whether the home and university lie on the same side or opposite sides. The total number of roads where they lie on opposite sides gives the answer, as each such road must be crossed exactly once.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    \n    x1 = float(data[0])\n    y1 = float(data[1])\n    x2 = float(data[2])\n    y2 = float(data[3])\n    \n    n = int(data[4])\n    \n    index = 5\n    lines = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = float(data[index])\n        b = float(data[index+1])\n        c = float(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        lines.append((a, b, c))\n    \n    count = 0\n    for a, b, c in lines:\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        \n        if (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0) or (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0):\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the coordinates of the home and university, the number of roads, and the coefficients defining each road.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the code checks whether the home and university lie on opposite sides of the road by evaluating the sign of the linear equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) at both points.\n3. **Counting Separating Roads**: If the signs of the evaluated equations for the home and university differ, the road is counted as separating the two blocks.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of such roads is printed, which represents the minimal number of steps needed to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the geometric properties of lines and points to determine the solution with a linear pass through each road, making it optimal for the given constraints.",
