She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n The idea is to consider that we only need to leave the tabs from l to r. The cursor starts at 'pos'. We can move the cursor (with constraints) and close tabs to the left or right.\n\n However, note that the problem allows two types of operations per second:\n  1. Move the cursor one step to the left or right (but within the current bounds [a, b] where a and b are the minimum and maximum index of unclosed tabs).\n  2. Close all tabs to the left of the cursor (if any) or all tabs to the right (if any).\n\n The goal is to minimize the seconds.\n\n Observing that we want to leave [l, r], we can break the problem into two parts: \n  - Closing all tabs to the left of l (if any)\n  - Closing all tabs to the right of r (if any)\n\n But note: the closing operations are done from the current cursor position. Also, moving the cursor might be necessary to reach a position from which we can close.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require the cursor to be in a particular tab at the end. We just need to have the tabs [l, r] remaining.\n\n Let's think about the boundaries:\n\n Case 1: If the entire segment [1, n] is already the desired segment [l, r] (i.e., if l == 1 and r == n), then we don't need to do anything -> 0 seconds.\n\n Case 2: Otherwise, we have to close some tabs. There are two possibilities: we might need to close the left part (from 1 to l-1) and/or the right part (from r+1 to n).\n\n How can we close the left part? We must move the cursor to a tab that is >= l (so that when we close the left, we don't accidentally close the desired segment). Actually, the operation \"close all tabs to the left\" will close everything from the current minimum tab (which initially is 1) up to the cursor's current tab minus one. So if we are at a tab i and we close the left, then tabs 1 to i-1 are closed. But we don't want to close below l. Therefore, we must ensure that when we close the left, the cursor is at least at l. Similarly, for the right: we must be at most at r.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If the current set of tabs is already [l, r] (meaning no tabs need to be closed), then answer 0.\n\n 2. Otherwise, we may need to close the left part (from 1 to l-1) and/or the right part (from r+1 to n). \n\n However, note that the problem allows interleaving of moves and closing operations. But observe:\n\n - We can only close the left part from a cursor that is at least at l (so that we don't close the desired part). Similarly, we can only close the right part from a cursor that is at most at r.\n\n 3. We have two independent tasks: closing the left and closing the right. But sometimes we can do both in one go by going to one end and then the other.\n\n Consider:\n\n Option 1: Only close the left part (if there is any tab to the left of l) and not the right part (if the right part is already closed or we don't need to close it). Similarly for only the right part.\n\n Option 2: Close both the left and the right. But note: we can also consider that after closing one side, the available tabs change, so the movement boundaries change. However, the problem says that when we close, the minimum and maximum index of unclosed tabs update. This complicates the matter.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider that we must eventually have the segment [l, r]. We can break the problem into two independent segments: the left part and the right part.\n\n But note: the cursor must be moved to the appropriate positions to perform the closing. Also, we might do:\n\n Scenario A: Close left first, then right.\n   - To close left, we need to move the cursor to at least l (if we are not already at l or beyond). Then we close the left. After closing the left, the minimum index becomes l (if we closed everything from 1 to l-1). Then we can move the cursor to a position <= r to close the right.\n\n Scenario B: Close right first, then left.\n\n However, we can also combine the movements: for example, if we need to close both sides, we can move the cursor to l (to close left) and then from l move to r (to close right). But note: after closing the left, the maximum tab is still n, but we cannot close the right from a cursor at l because the right part is from r+1 to n, and we haven't closed the right part yet. Actually, after closing the left, the set of tabs is [l, n]. Now we want to close the right from [l, n] to leave [l, r]. So we must move the cursor from l to r (if we are at l, then we move right until r) and then close the right.\n\n Similarly, if we close the right first: we move to r, close the right (leaving [1, r]), then move to l (if l is not already at r) and close the left.\n\n However, note that we might not need to go all the way to the ends. For example, if we are already at a position that allows us to close one side without moving, we can do that.\n\n Let me define:\n\n  left_to_close = (l > 1)   [meaning there are tabs to the left of l]\n  right_to_close = (r < n)   [meaning there are tabs to the right of r]\n\n But note: the initial cursor is at 'pos'. We don't necessarily have to go to l to close the left. Actually, to close the left, we must be at a tab i such that i >= l (so that the closing operation doesn't remove the desired segment). Similarly, for the right, we must be at a tab i <= r.\n\n However, we can also consider that we might close the left from a position that is greater than l, but then we have to ensure that the closing operation doesn't remove the desired segment. Since the operation closes [a, i-1] (where a is the current minimum tab) and we want to leave [l, r], we must have i-1 >= l-1? Actually, no: the operation will close from the current minimum (which after previous closings might be l) to i-1. So if we are at i and i-1 >= l, then we are closing from l to i-1? That would remove the desired segment if i-1 >= l and we are closing from l to i-1. \n\n Let me re-read: \"close all the tabs to the left of the cursor\" means closing all tabs with indices from [a, i-1] (the current minimum a to i-1). Since we want to leave [l, r], we must avoid closing any tab >= l. Therefore, we must have i-1 < l, meaning i <= l. But wait, if i is at l, then we close [a, l-1] which is safe (since l is kept). Similarly, for the right: we close [i+1, b] and we must have i+1 > r, so i > r.\n\n So actually, to close the left part (without affecting the desired segment [l, r]), we must be at a tab i such that i <= l (so that we don't close any tab >= l). Similarly, to close the right part, we must be at a tab i such that i >= r (so that we don't close any tab <= r).\n\n Therefore, the conditions for closing the left part are: we must be at a tab i with i <= l. Similarly, for the right part: i >= r.\n\n Now, we have two independent tasks, but the cursor must be moved appropriately.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If the entire range is already [l, r] (i.e., l==1 and r==n), then 0.\n\n 2. Otherwise, we can consider two cases: whether we need to close the left and/or the right.\n\n Let's denote:\n   left_needed = (l > 1)\n   right_needed = (r < n)\n\n But note: even if the left part exists, we might not need to close it if the cursor is already at a position <= l (then we can close the left without affecting the desired segment). Similarly for the right.\n\n However, the problem does not require the cursor to be in a particular place at the end, so we can plan the moves.\n\n We can break down the required moves:\n\n Case A: No closing needed (already [l, r]) -> 0.\n\n Case B: Only left needs to be closed (right is already okay, i.e., r == n) and we are not already at a position to close the left (if we are at a tab <= l, then we can close the left without moving; else we need to move to a tab <= l). But wait: what if the current cursor is to the right of l? Then we must move left to a tab <= l to close the left. Similarly, if we need to close the right and the cursor is not at a tab >= r, we must move right.\n\n However, note: the initial state has all tabs open. So the entire [1, n] is open. We are at 'pos'. We need to leave [l, r]. So:\n\n  - If the current cursor is already at a tab <= l, then we can close the left part (if left_needed) without moving. Then we check if the right part is already closed? Actually, no: initially, the entire set is open. We are leaving [l, r]. So we must close the left and/or the right.\n\n But note: the problem does not require the cursor to be at a particular position, and we can interleave moves and closes. However, the above condition for closing left is that the cursor must be at a tab i<=l. Similarly, for the right, i>=r.\n\n Therefore, we can think of:\n\n  Steps for closing left:\n    - If we are at a tab <= l, then we can close the left (1 second).\n    - Otherwise, we must move to a tab <= l. The minimal moves to get to a tab <= l is: \n        Option 1: move left until we hit l (if we are to the right of l) OR move left until we hit the left boundary (but note: the left boundary is 1, so we can stop at l). The number of moves is (current position - l) if we are to the right of l? But wait, we can also move directly to l.\n\n  However, note: we are allowed to move one step at a time. The minimal steps to get from 'pos' to a tab <= l is: \n      If pos <= l: then we are already at a tab <= l, so no move needed (unless we are exactly at l, then we can close).\n      If pos > l: then we need to move left until we reach l (or even less, but we only need to reach a tab <= l). The minimal moves is (pos - l) because we can move left (pos-l) times.\n\n  Similarly, for the right: \n      If pos >= r: then we can close the right without moving (1 second).\n      Else: we need to move right (r - pos) times to get to r (or more, but we only need to get to r).\n\n But note: we might be able to do both in one continuous path. However, the problem allows interleaving. But observe: we can only close one side at a time. And we can only move one step per second.\n\n However, we have two independent operations. We can also consider that we might not need to go all the way to l or r. Actually, for closing the left, we can close from any tab i <= l. Similarly, for the right, from any tab i>=r.\n\n But note: the problem states that when we close, we use the current minimum and maximum. Initially, the min is 1 and max is n. After closing the left, the min becomes l (because we close from 1 to i-1, and if i<=l then i-1<l, so the remaining tabs start at l). Then the maximum remains n until we close the right.\n\n However, the problem is asking for the minimum seconds.\n\n We can consider two strategies:\n\n Strategy 1: Close the left first, then the right.\n   Steps:\n     Step 1: Move the cursor from pos to a tab i (<= l) if necessary. Then close the left (1 second).\n     Step 2: Then, from the current position (which is now at i, and i<=l) we need to move to a tab j (>= r) to close the right. Then close the right (1 second).\n\n     The total seconds for this strategy would be:\n        moves_left = 0 if pos <= l else (pos - l)   [because we can stop at l, so we move (pos - l) steps left]\n        Then 1 second to close the left.\n        Then, from the current position (after closing left, we are at the same cursor position) we need to move to a tab >= r. The minimal moves from the current position (which is now at the position we used for closing left, say p1) to a tab >= r is: \n            If p1 >= r: then 0 moves, else (r - p1) moves.\n        Then 1 second to close the right.\n\n     But note: after closing the left, the set of tabs changes. However, the cursor position remains the same. But the available tabs change, so the boundaries for movement change. However, we are only concerned with the minimal moves to get to a tab >= r. In the new state, the minimum tab is l and the maximum is still n (until we close the right). But note: we can move freely between l and n? Actually, the movement is defined as: from i you can move to max(i-1, a) and min(i+1, b). After closing the left, a becomes l. So the movement is bounded by [l, n]. Therefore, we can move from the current position (which is <= l) to r (which is >= l) by moving right.\n\n     However, we don't need to move beyond r. The minimal steps to get from p1 (<=l) to r (which is >= l) is (r - p1) if p1 <= r? But note: p1 is <= l, and l<=r, so p1<=r. Then we move (r-p1) steps.\n\n     Total for Strategy 1: (moves_left) + 1 + (r - p1) + 1\n\n     But note: we chose p1 as the position to close the left. We don't have to go to l necessarily. We can choose any tab i<=l. The minimal moves for the left part is (pos - l) because we can stop at l. However, we can also stop earlier? Actually, if we stop at a tab < l, then we have to move further to the right for the next part. So the optimal for the left part is to go to l (the closest to the right) because then we minimize the subsequent rightward movement.\n\n     Therefore, we should set p1 = l (if we are closing the left first). Then the moves for the left part: if pos <= l, then 0 moves, else (pos-l) moves. Then from l to r: (r-l) moves (if we are going from l to r). Then plus 2 seconds for the two closes.\n\n     So total for Strategy 1: \n        left_moves = max(0, pos - l)   [if pos>l, then we move left (pos-l) steps to get to l; if pos<=l, we don't move]\n        Then 1 second to close the left.\n        Then right_moves = (r - l)       [from l to r]\n        Then 1 second to close the right.\n        Total = left_moves + 1 + right_moves + 1 = left_moves + right_moves + 2\n\n Strategy 2: Close the right first, then the left.\n   Steps:\n        Step 1: Move the cursor from pos to a tab i (>= r) if necessary. Then close the right (1 second).\n        Step 2: Then, from the current position (now at i, and i>=r) we need to move to a tab j (<= l) to close the left. Then close the left (1 second).\n\n        Moves for the right part: if pos >= r, then 0 moves, else (r-pos) moves.\n        Then 1 second for closing the right.\n        Then from the current position (which is now at r, because we moved to r) we need to move to a tab <= l. The minimal moves is (current_position - l) but note: we are at r (which is >= l) so we move left (r-l) steps? Actually, from r to l: (r-l) steps.\n\n        Total for Strategy 2: \n            right_moves = max(0, r - pos)\n            Then 1 second for closing the right.\n            Then left_moves = (r - l)   [from r to l]   [Note: we are at r (from closing the right) and we need to go to l (<= r) so (r-l) steps? Actually, we are at r, and we want to go to l (which is <= r) so the distance is (r-l) if we move left (r-l) times.\n            Then 1 second for closing the left.\n            Total = right_moves + 1 + (r-l) + 1 = right_moves + (r-l) + 2\n\n But note: in Strategy 2, we are going from r to l. However, we might not have to go all the way to l? Actually, to close the left we must be at a tab <= l. The minimal tab we can use is l (because we don't want to overshoot). So we have to move from r to l: (r-l) steps.\n\n However, we have two strategies. But note: we might not need to do both. \n\n Strategy 3: Only close the left (if right part is already closed? Actually, no: the initial state has all tabs open. We are leaving [l, r]. So if the left part exists (l>1) and the right part exists (r<n), then we must do both.\n\n But what if only one side exists?\n\n Example: Input \"6 3 2 4\" -> Output 5.\n\n In this example: n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\n We need to close left (tabs 1) and right (tabs 5,6).\n\n According to Strategy 1:\n   left_moves = |3-2| = 1 (move from 3 to 2)\n   Then 1 second to close left.\n   Then from 2 to 4: 2 moves (2->3->4) -> but wait, actually from 2 to 4 we move right 2 steps (because 4-2=2)\n   Then 1 second to close right.\n   Total = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5.\n\n According to Strategy 2:\n   right_moves = |4-3| = 1 (move from 3 to 4)\n   Then 1 second to close right.\n   Then from 4 to 2: 2 moves (4->3->2)\n   Then 1 second to close left.\n   Total = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5.\n\n Now, what if we don't need to do both?\n\n Example: Input \"6 3 1 3\" -> Output 1.\n\n Here, we need to close the right (tabs 4,5,6). The left part is already closed (since l=1, so no left to close). \n\n So we only need to close the right. We must be at a tab >=3 (which we are) so we can close the right in 1 second.\n\n Strategy 3: Only close the right (if left is already closed or not needed) and no left.\n\n Similarly, Example: Input \"5 2 1 5\" -> Output 0.\n\n Now, what if we only need to close the left?\n\n Example: n=10, pos=5, l=5, r=10 -> then we need to close the left (if any) and the right (if any). But wait, l=5, so left part is 1..4. We must close the left. We are at 5 (which is >=5, but we need to be <=5 to close the left? Actually, condition for closing left: we must be at a tab i<=l. Since l=5, we are at 5 (<=5) so we can close the left without moving. Then we have to close the right? The desired segment is [5,10] and the current state after closing the left is [5,10] (so the right part is already desired). Actually, the problem says: leave only [l, r]. So if we close the left, we are left with [5,10] which is [l, r]. So we don't need to close the right.\n\n But wait, the input was: n=10, pos=5, l=5, r=10. Then we only need to close the left. So the steps:\n\n   Check: left_to_close = (l>1) -> 5>1 -> True, right_to_close = (r<n) -> 10<10 -> False.\n\n   So we only need to close the left.\n\n   Steps: since we are at 5 (<=5) we can close the left in 1 second.\n\n   Total: 1.\n\n However, if we are at 6 (which is >5) and we need to close the left? Then we must move to 5 (which is <=5) then close the left. Then the total moves: (6-5)=1 move to get to 5, then 1 second to close, so 2 seconds.\n\n Similarly, if we are at 4 (<=5) then we can close the left from 4: 1 second.\n\n Therefore, the general solution:\n\n We have three cases:\n\n  1. If the desired segment [l, r] is the entire set [1, n]: then 0.\n  2. Else, we break into:\n\n      a. If we need to close the left (left_exists = (l>1)) and we need to close the right (right_exists = (r<n)):\n          Then we can choose either strategy 1 or strategy 2. The answer would be the minimum of the two strategies.\n\n      b. If we only need to close the left (right_exists is False, i.e., r==n):\n          Then we must move to a tab <= l (if we are not already at one) and then close the left.\n\n          Steps:\n            If pos <= l: then we can close the left immediately (1 second).\n            Else: we move left (pos-l) steps and then 1 second to close.\n\n          Total = (max(0, pos-l)) + 1\n\n      c. If we only need to close the right (left_exists is False, i.e., l==1):\n          Then we must move to a tab >= r (if we are not already at one) and then close the right.\n\n          Steps:\n            If pos >= r: then we can close the right immediately (1 second).\n            Else: we move right (r-pos) steps and then 1 second to close.\n\n          Total = (max(0, r-pos)) + 1\n\n But wait, what if we are in a situation where we need to close both, but we are already at a position that can close one without moving, and then we can use that to help the other? Actually, our strategies 1 and 2 account for both.\n\n However, let me test the example \"6 3 2 4\" (which requires both) and the example \"6 3 1 3\" (only right) and \"5 2 1 5\" (none) and \"n=10, pos=5, l=5, r=10\" (only left).\n\n But note: in the example \"6 3 2 4\", we have:\n      left_exists = (2>1) -> True\n      right_exists = (4<6) -> True\n\n      Then we do the minimum of:\n          Strategy 1: (max(0,3-2)=1) + (4-2)=2 + 2 = 5\n          Strategy 2: (max(0,4-3)=1) + (4-2)=2 + 2 = 5\n\n      So 5.\n\n Another example: n=10, pos=7, l=5, r=8.\n\n      left_exists = (5>1) -> True\n      right_exists = (8<10) -> True\n\n      Strategy 1:\n          left_moves: from 7 to 5: 2 moves.\n          Then 1 second to close left.\n          Then from 5 to 8: 3 moves (5->6->7->8) but wait, we are at 5, and we want to get to 8 (>=8). The minimal moves is (8-5)=3.\n          Then 1 second to close right.\n          Total: 2+1+3+1 = 7.\n\n      Strategy 2:\n          right_moves: from 7 to 8: 1 move.\n          Then 1 second to close right.\n          Then from 8 to 5: 3 moves (8->7->6->5)\n          Then 1 second to close left.\n          Total: 1+1+3+1 = 6.\n\n      Therefore, the answer would be 6.\n\n However, wait: after closing the right, the set of tabs becomes [1,8] (if we close the right from 8, then we close [9,10]). Then the left part is still [1,5] (we want to leave [5,8]). So we must close the left from a tab <=5. We are at 8, so we must move left from 8 to 5: 3 moves.\n\n But note: the problem allows that we can close the left from any tab <=5. We don't have to go to the very left, but 5 is the minimal we need (because if we are at 6, then we close [1,5] (if the current minimum is 1) but wait: after closing the right, the set of tabs is [1,8]. Then the current minimum is 1. So to close the left from a tab i (which must be <=5) we can choose to go to 5 (the closest to the center) to minimize the subsequent moves? Actually, the minimal moves is from 8 to 5: 3.\n\n However, what if we don't go to 5 but to 1? Then the moves would be 7 (from 8 to 1) which is worse. So we choose to go to 5.\n\n But note: the condition for closing the left is that the cursor must be at a tab i such that i<=l (l=5). So we can stop at any tab from 1 to 5. The minimal number of moves from 8 to a tab <=5 is (8-5)=3 (if we move left until 5). So yes.\n\n Therefore, the two strategies are:\n\n   Strategy 1: \n        left_moves = max(0, pos - l)   [to get to l from the left side]\n        Then, from l to r: (r - l)   [because we are at l and need to get to r (>=l) to close the right]\n        Total_seconds = left_moves + 1 + (r-l) + 1\n\n   Strategy 2:\n        right_moves = max(0, r - pos)   [to get to r from the right side]\n        Then, from r to l: (r - l)   [because we are at r and need to get to l (<=r) to close the left]\n        Total_seconds = right_moves + 1 + (r-l) + 1\n\n But wait, why in Strategy 1 we add (r-l) and in Strategy 2 we also add (r-l)? \n\n Explanation for Strategy 1: \n   After closing the left, we are at l. Then we move from l to r (which is (r-l) steps to the right).\n\n Explanation for Strategy 2:\n   After closing the right, we are at r. Then we move from r to l (which is (r-l) steps to the left).\n\n But note: (r-l) is the same in both.\n\n However, we must consider that we might not need to traverse the entire segment [l, r] if we are already in the segment. But wait, in Strategy 1 we are starting at l (after closing the left) and then we go to r. The distance is (r-l). Similarly, in Strategy 2 we are starting at r (after closing the right) and then we go to l: the distance is (r-l).\n\n But note: the minimal path from l to r is (r-l) and from r to l is (r-l). So that part is fixed.\n\n However, is it possible that we don't need to traverse the entire segment? \n\n Actually, no: because to close the right we must be at a tab >=r, and the closest is r (because if we are at r, we can close the right). Similarly, to close the left we must be at a tab <=l, and the closest is l.\n\n But wait, what if we are already at a position that is in the desired segment [l, r]? Then:\n\n   Example: n=10, pos=5, l=3, r=7.\n\n   We need to close both sides.\n\n   Strategy 1: \n        left_moves = max(0, 5-3)=2 -> move from 5 to 3 (2 steps left)\n        Then close left (1)\n        Then from 3 to 7 (4 steps right)\n        Then close right (1)\n        Total = 2+1+4+1 = 8.\n\n   Strategy 2:\n        right_moves = max(0,7-5)=2 -> move from 5 to 7 (2 steps right)\n        Then close right (1)\n        Then from 7 to 3 (4 steps left)\n        Then close left (1)\n        Total = 2+1+4+1 = 8.\n\n   But wait, is there a better way? \n\n   Consider: we can move from 5 to 3 (2 steps) and then from 3 to 7 (4 steps) -> that's 6 moves, plus 2 seconds for closing -> 8.\n\n   Alternatively, we can move from 5 to 7 (2 steps) and then from 7 to 3 (4 steps) -> 8.\n\n   But note: we can also consider doing a combination: maybe we can move to a point in the middle and then close both? However, we cannot close both from the same position. \n\n   However, note: after closing one side, the boundaries change. But in this example, we are closing the left first: then the set becomes [3,10]. Then we have to close the right from a tab >=7. We are at 3, so we must move to 7 (4 steps). Similarly, if we close the right first, the set becomes [1,7] and then we have to close the left from a tab<=3, and we are at 7, so we move to 3 (4 steps). \n\n   But wait, what if we close the left from a position closer to the right? Actually, the condition for closing the left is that we must be at a tab <=3. The minimal steps from 5 to 3 is 2. Then from 3 we must move to 7 (4 steps) to close the right. \n\n   Alternatively, we can close the left from 3, then the set becomes [3,10]. Now, we are at 3. Then we can move to 7 (4 steps) and close the right. \n\n   Is there a possibility to use the fact that after closing the left, the left boundary is 3, so we can move from 3 to 7 without worrying about the left? Yes, but the distance is fixed.\n\n   However, what if we do:\n\n        Move from 5 to 7 (2 steps right) -> then close the right (1) -> then we are at 7, and the set is [1,7]. Then we must close the left: we must be at a tab <=3. So we move from 7 to 3 (4 steps left) -> then close the left (1). Total 2+1+4+1=8.\n\n   Same as above.\n\n   But wait, what if we do:\n\n        Move from 5 to 4 (1 step left) -> then we are at 4, which is not <=3, so we cannot close the left from here. Then we must continue to 3 (another step) -> then we can close the left. Then we are at 3. Then we move to 7 (4 steps) and close the right. Total: 1+1+1+4+1 = 8.\n\n   Or:\n\n        Move from 5 to 4 (1 step left) -> then to 3 (1 step) -> then close left (1). Then from 3 to 7 (4 steps) -> close right (1). Total: 1+1+1+4+1 = 8.\n\n   So no improvement.\n\n   However, note: we can interleave moves and closes arbitrarily. But the above two strategies are the two natural ways (left first or right first). \n\n   But wait, is there a possibility to close one side from a position that is not the boundary? \n\n   For the left: we can close the left from any tab i<=l. So if we are at 3, we can close. But we can also close from 2 or 1? But if we close from 2, then we close [1,1] (if the current minimum is 1) and then we are still at 2. Then we can close the left again? Actually, we don't need to: because we want to leave [l, r] = [3,7]. After closing the left from 2, we have closed [1,1] (so the left part is closed). Then we are at 2, which is less than 3. Then we can move to 3 (1 step) and then close the left again? Actually, no: because after the first closing, the set becomes [2,10] (if we started with [1,10] and closed [1,1] from 2). Then we are at 2. Now, to close the left again, we would close [min_current, 1] (which is [2,1]) -> but 2 is in the desired segment. So we cannot close the left from 2 because it would close the desired segment.\n\n   Therefore, we must close the left from a tab that is <=l (and the desired segment starts at l). So the closing operation must not close the desired segment. The operation \"close all the tabs to the left\" will close from the current minimum (which might be updated by previous closings) to i-1. In the initial state, the current minimum is 1. So if we are at 2 (which is <3) and we close the left, we close [1,1] (which is okay). But then the current minimum becomes 2. Then we cannot close the left again (because we want to leave [3,7]) and if we try to close the left from 2, we would close [2,1] (but 2 is in the desired segment). \n\n   So we must close the left only once and from a tab that is <=l and ensures that we don't close the desired segment. In fact, we only need to close the left part (all tabs from 1 to l-1). So we can do it in one operation.\n\n   Therefore, the above strategies are correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem allows that we can move arbitrarily and close arbitrarily. But the two strategies are the extremes. What if we do:\n\n        Move to a tab that is in the middle (say 5) and then ... but we cannot close from the middle.\n\n   So we must close one side at a time.\n\n   Therefore, the answer for the case when both sides need to be closed is the minimum of the two strategies.\n\n   But wait, there is a third strategy: \n\n        We can move to a tab that is in the desired segment (but not necessarily the boundary) and then use two moves? \n\n   Actually, no: because the closing operations require being at the boundary (for the side we wish to close). \n\n   However, note: we don't necessarily have to go to the boundary of the desired segment. For the left, we can close from any tab <=l. But the minimal moves to get to a tab <=l is (pos-l) if we are to the right of l, or 0 if we are at or left of l. Similarly, for the right.\n\n   So the two strategies are:\n\n        Strategy 1: \n            moves = (max(0, pos - l)) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n\n        Strategy 2:\n           ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] in her browser. The browser starts with all tabs open, and the cursor is initially at a given position. Each second, Luba can move the cursor left or right by one tab or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to leave only the tabs from `l` to `r` inclusive. The key observation is that closing tabs outside this segment requires either closing all tabs to the left of `l` or all tabs to the right of `r`, or both. The challenge is to find the optimal sequence of moves and closes to minimize the time taken.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **No Action Needed**: If the entire range of tabs (1 to n) is already within [l, r], no action is required.\n   - **Close Left Only**: If there are tabs to the left of `l` but not to the right of `r`, Luba must move the cursor to a tab ≤ `l` and then close the left tabs.\n   - **Close Right Only**: Similarly, if there are tabs to the right of `r` but not to the left of `l`, she must move to a tab ≥ `r` and close the right tabs.\n   - **Close Both Sides**: If both sides need closing, she can either:\n     - Move left to `l`, close the left tabs, then move right to `r`, and close the right tabs.\n     - Move right to `r`, close the right tabs, then move left to `l`, and close the left tabs.\n   The optimal strategy is the one with fewer total moves.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - Calculate the moves required for each possible strategy (closing left first or right first) and choose the minimum.\n   - The total time is the sum of moves and two close operations (one for each side if both are needed).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves simple arithmetic operations and conditional checks, making it efficient with a constant time complexity O(1).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    left_needed = (l > 1)\n    right_needed = (r < n)\n    \n    if not left_needed and not right_needed:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    if left_needed and not right_needed:\n        moves_left = max(0, pos - l)\n        total_seconds = moves_left + 1\n        print(total_seconds)\n        return\n        \n    if not left_needed and right_needed:\n        moves_right = max(0, r - pos)\n        total_seconds = moves_right + 1\n        print(total_seconds)\n        return\n        \n    # Both sides need to be closed\n    strategy1 = max(0, pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n    strategy2 = max(0, r - pos) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n    print(min(strategy1, strategy2))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initial Check**: If the desired segment [l, r] covers all tabs (1 to n), the answer is 0 since no tabs need closing.\n- **Left Only Case**: If only tabs to the left of `l` need closing, calculate the moves required to reach a tab ≤ `l` from the initial position and add one second for the close operation.\n- **Right Only Case**: Similarly, if only tabs to the right of `r` need closing, calculate moves to reach a tab ≥ `r` and add one second for the close operation.\n- **Both Sides Case**: For closing both sides, compute the time for two strategies (left first or right first) and choose the minimum. Each strategy involves moving to the respective boundary, closing the side, moving to the other boundary, and closing the other side. The total time is the sum of these moves and two close operations.",
