The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the task locations)\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (from 1 to n, then back to 1), we can consider the movement in two directions.\n\n However, note: the problem states that Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in order. \n The key is: for the i-th task, she must be in house a_i and also have completed all tasks with numbers less than i.\n\n Since the ringroad is one-way clockwise, moving from house x to house y:\n   If x <= y: then the distance is (y - x) mod n? But wait, because it's a ring, we might have two ways: \n   Actually, because it's a ring and one-way (clockwise only), we can only move clockwise.\n\n But note: the problem says \"moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time\", and the ringroad is circular (n houses) and one-way clockwise.\n\n So the movement is always in the increasing direction (from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, ... n-1 to n, n to 1, etc.)\n\n How do we calculate the distance from current house to next task house?\n\n However, note: the example input: \n   \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" -> output 6\n\n Steps: \n   Start at 1. Then first task is at 3.\n        From 1 to 3: \n            Option: 1->2->3 (2 steps) OR 1->4->3? But wait, the ringroad is one-way clockwise, so we cannot go counterclockwise.\n        Actually, from 1 we can go: 1->2->3->4->1->... but note: the ringroad is one-way, so the only way is clockwise.\n\n Therefore, the distance from house x to house y (if moving clockwise) is:\n   If y >= x: then (y - x)\n   If y < x: then (n - x + y)   [because we go from x to n, then from n to 1, and then to y]\n\n However, note: the example: from 3 to 2: \n        According to above: since 2 < 3, then (n - 3 + 2) = (4-3+2)=3, but the example sequence was 1->2->3->4->1->2->3, so from 3 to 2: \n        They went 3->4->1->2, which is 3 steps? \n\n But wait, the example total time was 6. Let's break down:\n\n        Start at 1.\n        First task at 3: 1->2->3 (distance=2)\n        Then from 3 to 2: 3->4->1->2 (distance=3) -> total now 5\n        Then from 2 to 3: 2->3 (distance=1) -> total 6.\n\n However, note that the example does not require to return to start necessarily. We just need to complete the tasks in order.\n\n But there is a catch: the problem says \"Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1\" and then \"m things to do\", and she must complete them in order.\n\n However, observe: the tasks are given as a list. We start at 1, then go to a1, then from a1 to a2, then from a2 to a3, etc.\n\n So the total time is the sum of distances from the starting point (1) to a1, then from a1 to a2, then from a2 to a3, ... until the last task.\n\n But note: the example input is \"4 3\\n3 2 3\", meaning the tasks are at houses 3, then 2, then 3.\n\n Steps:\n   Start at 1, then go to 3: distance = (3-1) = 2? \n        But wait, if we think about the ring: from 1 to 3: \n            Clockwise: 1->2->3: that's 2 steps.\n\n   Then from 3 to 2: \n        Since 2 is less than 3, we go from 3 to 4, then 4 to 1, then 1 to 2: 3 steps.\n\n   Then from 2 to 3: \n        Since 3>2: 3-2 = 1 step.\n\n   Total: 2+3+1 = 6.\n\n However, wait: the example output is 6.\n\n But note: there is another way to compute the distance from x to y in a circular one-way clockwise road:\n\n   d(x, y) =",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad in a clockwise direction. The key observation here is that Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete each task in the given order, moving only clockwise. The challenge lies in efficiently calculating the distance between consecutive task locations, considering the circular nature of the ringroad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia moves in a clockwise direction along a circular ring of `n` houses. Each move between adjacent houses takes one unit of time. The task locations are given in an array, and Xenia must visit them in sequence starting from house 1.\n2. **Insight**: The distance between two houses `x` and `y` (where `y >= x`) is simply `y - x`. However, if `y < x`, the distance is calculated as `(n - x + y)` because Xenia must traverse the ring from `x` to `n`, then wrap around to house 1 and proceed to `y`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each task location, compute the distance from the previous task location (or start position for the first task) using the above formula. Sum these distances to get the total time required.\n4. **Optimization**: The solution efficiently processes each task in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes (up to 10^5 tasks).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    total_time = 0\n    current = 1\n    \n    for a in tasks:\n        if a >= current:\n            total_time += (a - current)\n        else:\n            total_time += (n - current + a)\n        current = a\n\n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of houses `n`, the number of tasks `m`, and the list of task locations.\n2. **Initialization**: `total_time` is initialized to 0, representing the cumulative time taken. `current` is set to 1, indicating the starting position.\n3. **Processing Tasks**: For each task location `a` in the list:\n   - If `a` is greater than or equal to `current`, the distance is `a - current`.\n   - If `a` is less than `current`, the distance is `(n - current + a)`, accounting for the circular movement.\n   - The `current` position is updated to `a` after processing each task.\n4. **Output**: The total time is printed after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal time by leveraging the circular nature of the ringroad and processes each task in constant time, resulting in an overall linear time complexity.",
