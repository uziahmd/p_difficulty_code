He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed that the string only contains 'a','b','c'\n Conditions:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from the problem statement, because A appended some 'b's to a string of 'a's).\n 2. The process: \n    - Start with some number of 'a's (at least one)\n    - Then append some number of 'b's (at least one)\n    - Then append some number of 'c's (the count of 'c' must be equal to the count of 'a' OR the count of 'b' OR both)\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: 'bbacc' -> Output: 'NO'\n\n Why? Because even though the number of 'c' is 2 (which is equal to the number of 'b'? Actually, let's break down:\n\n But wait, the example says: \n   Example 2: Input \"bbacc\" -> Output \"NO\"\n\n Let's analyze \"bbacc\":\n   Count of 'a': 1\n   Count of 'b': 2\n   Count of 'c': 2\n\n The condition for 'c' is that it must be either the count of 'a' (which is 1) or the count of 'b' (which is 2). \n Here, the count of 'c' is 2, which equals the count of 'b'. So why NO?\n\n The catch: the problem also requires that the string is built in order: first all 'a's, then all 'b's, then all 'c's.\n\n Therefore, we must check:\n   - The string should not have any 'a' after a 'b' or 'c', nor any 'b' after a 'c'.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check the order: \n    - The string must be non-decreasing in the sense: all 'a's (if any) must come first, then all 'b's, then all 'c's.\n\n    However, note: the problem does not require that the original string from A has at least one 'a' and then B appends at least one 'b', and then C appends at least one 'c'. But wait, the problem states: \"they have made sure that at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist\", but for C, the number of 'c' can be zero? Actually, note: the problem says \"C appends some number of letters 'c'\", meaning at least one? Or can it be zero?\n\n    Let me re-read: \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\" -> \"some number\" typically implies at least one? But note the problem says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\". \n\n    However, the problem also says: \"It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.\"\n\n    But note: the entire string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. \n\n    Now, what if the string is just \"ab\"? Then C appends 0 'c'? But the problem says \"appends some number\", and \"some\" might include zero? However, the condition about the count of 'c' being equal to the count of 'a' or 'b' would then be 0, so if the count of 'a' is 1 and count of 'b' is 1, then 0 is not equal to 1. But wait, the problem says: \"C appends some number of letters 'c'\", and then the condition is that the number of letters 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. \n\n    However, note: the problem says \"B now gives this string to C\", meaning the string at that point has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends c's. The total string then is the original (with a's and b's) plus the appended c's.\n\n    The condition for the number of c's is based on the entire string? Or the string before appending?\n\n    Let me read: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\"\n\n    The problem says \"in the string\", but at which point? It says: \"B now gives this string to C\", so the string given to C is the one with the a's and b's. Then C appends c's. The condition is that the number of c's appended is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' in the string (which is the string given to C, i.e., without the c's).\n\n    Therefore, the condition is on the counts of 'a' and 'b' in the part that was originally from A and B (without the c's). But note: the entire string has more letters. However, the condition is stated as \"in the string\" — but the problem doesn't specify whether it's the current string (without the c's) or the entire string. \n\n    Clarification from the problem: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\"\n\n    Since C is appending the c's, the string at the moment of counting the 'a' and 'b' is the one that B gave, i.e., without the c's. Because the c's haven't been appended yet.\n\n    So the condition is: \n        Let n_a = count of 'a' in the entire string? No, because the entire string includes the c's, but the condition is on the string that B gave (which is the string without the c's). However, wait: the problem says \"in the string\", and when C is about to append, the string is the one from B (without c's). But note: the problem says \"B now gives this string to C\", so the string given to C has the a's and b's, and then C appends c's. Then the condition is that the number of c's appended is equal to the number of 'a' (in the entire string? or in the string given to C?) or to the number of 'b' (again, in which string?).\n\n    Let me check the example: \"aaabccc\"\n        Original A: \"aaa\" (3 a's)\n        B appends: \"b\" (so the string becomes \"aaab\")\n        Then C appends: 3 c's (because the number of a's is 3, and 3==3, so condition holds)\n\n    But note: the entire string has 3 a's, 1 b, and 3 c's. The condition is that the number of c's (3) is equal to the number of a's (3) OR the number of b's (1). So it is equal to the number of a's.\n\n    However, the condition says \"in the string\" — the string at the time of C's action is \"aaab\", which has 3 a's and 1 b. So the condition uses the counts from the string that B gave, i.e., without the c's.\n\n    Therefore, we can define:\n        n_a = count of 'a' in the entire string? No, because the entire string includes the c's. But wait, the a's and b's are fixed. Actually, the a's and b's are the same as in the string that B gave. So we can use the counts of 'a' and 'b' from the entire string, because the c's don't change the a's and b's.\n\n    However, there's a catch: what if there are c's in the middle? The problem says the string is built by appending, so the order must be: all a's, then all b's, then all c's.\n\n    Therefore, we must have three contiguous segments: first segment of 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's. And the entire string must not have an 'a' after a non-'a', etc.\n\n    So the steps:\n\n    1. Check that the string is of the form: [a...a][b...b][c...c] (possibly one of the middle parts missing? But note: the problem requires at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from A and B), and then C appends some c's (which may be zero). However, the problem says \"some number\" — but if zero is allowed, then we must consider that the condition for the c's would be 0. But the condition says the number of c's must be equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b' (in the string without the c's). \n\n    However, note: the entire string is given, and we don't know which part is which. But the problem says the process: first A gives a string of 'a's (at least one), then B appends 'b's (at least one), then C appends 'c's (at least one? or can be zero?).\n\n    Let me read the problem again: \"C appends some number of letters 'c'\". In English, \"some\" often means one or more, but sometimes it can mean zero or more. However, the problem also says: \"since C is a good friend... the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\" \n\n    If C appends zero, then the condition is: 0 == (count of 'a') or 0 == (count of 'b')? \n\n    But note: the string from B (without the c's) must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So the count of 'a' is at least 1 and the count of 'b' is at least 1. Therefore, 0 cannot be equal to the count of 'a' or 'b'. So if C appends zero, the condition fails. Therefore, the problem implies that C appends at least one 'c'? Actually, no: the condition must hold. So if the condition doesn't hold (because the count of c's is 0 and the counts of a and b are positive) then it's invalid. But wait, the problem says \"C appends some number\", meaning he is allowed to append zero? Then we must account for the possibility that the condition fails.\n\n    However, looking at the examples: \n        Example 3: \"aabc\" -> YES. \n        Breakdown: \n            Original A: \"aa\" (but wait, the string is \"aabc\": so the a's are two, then one b, then two c's? Actually, let me break down \"aabc\": \n            It has two 'a's, one 'b', and two 'c's. \n            Condition for c: the number of c's (2) must be equal to the number of a's (2) or the number of b's (1). \n            Since 2==2, condition holds.\n\n        But note: the string \"aabc\" has the form: \n            First two a's, then one b, then two c's. \n\n        Now, what if we have a string that does not have the correct order? Example 2: \"bbacc\"\n\n        How about \"ab\"? \n            Without any c's: then the condition for c's is 0, but the counts of a and b are 1 and 1, so 0 != 1 and 0 != 1 -> fails. So \"ab\" would be invalid? \n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"B now gives this string to C\", meaning the string from B is \"ab\", and then C appends some c's. The condition is that the number of c's (which is 0) must equal the number of a's (1) or the number of b's (1). It doesn't. So we must output \"NO\" for \"ab\".\n\n        However, the problem says: \"at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string\" — and here they do. But the entire string (if we consider the whole thing as given to C) is \"ab\", and then C appends 0 c's. But the problem says \"B appends some number of letters 'b'\", so B must have appended at least one. Then C appends some number (which we assume must be at least one? or can be zero?).\n\n        The problem says: \"C appends some number of letters 'c'\". The word \"some\" is ambiguous. But note the condition: the number of c's must be equal to the number of a's or b's. Since the condition must hold, if the condition fails then it's not valid.\n\n        However, the problem does not explicitly say that C appends at least one. But note: if C appends zero, then the condition fails (unless the counts of a or b are zero, which they aren't). Therefore, the only way to have a valid string is to have the c's appended and the condition holds.\n\n        So the string \"ab\" is invalid because even if we consider the entire string as \"ab\", the condition for the c's (which would be 0) fails.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string.\" — so the string from B is \"a\" (from A) plus \"b\"s (from B). Then C appends some c's. The condition for the c's is based on the string from B (without the c's). \n\n        So for \"ab\", the string from B is \"ab\", and then C appends 0 c's. The condition is 0 == count('a') in \"ab\" (which is 1) OR 0 == count('b') in \"ab\" (which is 1). That fails.\n\n        Now, what if we have a string that does not follow the order? Example: \"ba\" — invalid because the a's must come first, then b's.\n\n    Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n    Step 1: Check the order of the string.\n        We must have:\n            All 'a's (if any) must be at the beginning.\n            Then all 'b's (if any) must follow.\n            Then all 'c's (if any) must follow.\n\n        But note: the problem requires at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So we must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. However, what if there are no 'c's? Then the string ends with 'b's.\n\n        Example: \"aab\" — is this valid?\n            Counts: \n                a: 2, b: 1, c: 0.\n            Condition: the number of c's (0) must be equal to the number of a's (2) or the number of b's (1). 0 != 2 and 0 != 1 -> invalid.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"B appends some number of letters 'b'\", so the string from B is \"aaa\" (if A gave \"aaa\") plus some 'b's (at least one). Then C appends some c's. In this case, the string from B is \"aab\", so then C appends 0 c's. Condition fails.\n\n        However, what if we have a string that is just \"aab\"? Then the entire string is \"aab\", and we have to check if it can be broken down as:\n            A: \"aa\", then B: \"b\", then C: nothing (0 c's). Condition fails.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"B now gives this string to C\", meaning the string from B is \"aab\", and then C appends some c's. The condition is that the number of c's (to be appended) is equal to the number of a's (2) or the number of b's (1). So if C appends 2 c's, then the string becomes \"aabcc\" (wait, no: the condition is that the appended c's must be 2 or 1). \n\n        Actually, the condition is that the number of c's appended is either 2 (then total c's is 2) or 1 (then total c's is 1). But the string we have is \"aab\", meaning no c's. So we are not considering the entire string we have as the result? \n\n        Let me clarify: the problem says \"You have a string in your hands\". This string is the final string after C's appending. \n\n        Therefore, the input string is the entire string (with a's, b's, and c's). \n\n        So for \"aab\", the entire string is \"aab\", so the condition is: the number of c's in the entire string is 0, and we require that 0 equals the number of a's (2) or the number of b's (1) in the string from B (which is the string without the c's). But wait, the string from B is the entire string without the c's? \n\n        Actually, the process: \n            A gives a string of a's (say k a's) -> then B appends m b's (so the string from B is k a's + m b's) -> then C appends n c's, and n must be equal to k (number of a's in the string from B) or m (number of b's in the string from B). \n\n        Now, the entire string is k a's + m b's + n c's.\n\n        But note: the entire string includes the a's, b's, and the appended c's. However, the condition for the c's is based on the string from B (which is the a's and b's). \n\n        Therefore, we can extract:\n            n_c = n (the number of c's in the entire string)\n\n        And the condition is: n == k or n == m.\n\n        But note: k is the count of 'a' in the entire string (because the a's are only from A and they are unchanged). Similarly, m is the count of 'b' in the entire string? \n\n        Wait, no: the string from B is the a's and b's. Then C appends n c's. The entire string has k a's, m b's, and n c's.\n\n        However, the condition is: n (the number of c's appended) must be equal to k (the count of a's in the string from B, which is the same as the entire string) or to m (the count of b's in the string from B, which is the same as the entire string).\n\n        Therefore, the condition is: \n            n = k or n = m\n\n        But note: the entire string's count of a's is k, and the entire string's count of b's is m.\n\n        However, wait: the string from B is the a's and b's, so the entire string's a's are the same as the string from B's a's, and similarly for b's. \n\n        So the condition is: the total number of c's (n) must be either equal to the total number of a's (k) or the total number of b's (m).\n\n        Now, the order: the entire string must be non-decreasing: first all a's, then all b's, then all c's.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n        Let s = input string.\n\n        Step 1: Check the order.\n            We can traverse the string and ensure that once we leave an 'a' we don't see an 'a' again, and once we leave a 'b' we don't see a 'b' again.\n\n            Alternatively, we can check: \n                - The string must be divided into three parts: \n                    Part1: as many 'a's as possible at the beginning.\n                    Part2: as many 'b's as possible after the 'a's.\n                    Part3: as many 'c's as possible after the 'b's.\n\n            Then the entire string must be exactly these three parts.\n\n        Step 2: Count the number of a's, b's, and c's.\n\n            Let:\n                n_a = count of 'a' in s\n                n_b = count of 'b' in s\n                n_c = count of 'c' in s\n\n        Step 3: Check the condition for the c's: \n            n_c must be either n_a or n_b.\n\n        However, wait: the problem says the condition is that the number of c's appended (which is n_c) must be equal to the number of a's (which is n_a) OR the number of b's (which is n_b). \n\n        But note: the entire string's n_a and n_b are the same as the string from B (because the a's and b's are unchanged). \n\n        Therefore, the condition is: n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b.\n\n        Step 4: Also, we must check that the string is composed of three contiguous segments (as described above) and that there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. \n\n        However, note: the problem requires at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from A and B). \n\n        But wait, what if the entire string has no 'b'? Then the condition fails because we need at least one 'b'. Similarly, no 'a' is not allowed.\n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"they have made sure that at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string\" — meaning the string from B (without the c's) has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends some c's. The entire string we have is the one from B plus the c's. \n\n        But note: the entire string we have must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (because the string from B had them). So if the entire string we have has no 'a' or no 'b', that is impossible.\n\n        However, the entire string we have includes the a's and b's. So the entire string must have at least one 'a' and at least one 'b'. \n\n        But note: the condition on the counts of c's (step 3) is independent of the order. However, we must also check that the string is in the correct order.\n\n        So the complete conditions:\n\n        Condition 1: The string must have at least one 'a' and at least one 'b'.\n        Condition 2: The string must be of the form: [a...a][b...b][c...c] (i.e., no letter out of order).\n        Condition 3: The number of 'c's (n_c) must be equal to the number of 'a's (n_a) or the number of 'b's (n_b).\n\n        However, wait: what if the string does not contain any 'c'? Then n_c=0, and we require 0==n_a or 0==n_b. But n_a>=1 and n_b>=1 (from condition 1), so 0==n_a fails and 0==n_b fails. So condition 3 fails.\n\n        Example: \"aab\" -> \n            Condition 1: has at least one 'a' and one 'b' -> yes (a:2, b:1)\n            Condition 2: order is correct -> yes (first two a's, then one b, then no c's -> valid order)\n            Condition 3: n_c=0, so 0==2 or 0==1 -> no.\n\n        Therefore, \"aab\" is invalid.\n\n        Another example: \"aabbccc\" \n            Condition 1: has a and b -> yes.\n            Condition 2: order: a's, then b's, then c's -> yes.\n            Condition 3: n_c=3, and n_a=2, n_b=2 -> 3==2? no; 3==2? no -> invalid.\n\n        But wait, the example \"aaabccc\": \n            Condition 1: yes (a:3, b:1, c:3)\n            Condition 2: order: a's, then b, then c's -> yes.\n            Condition 3: n_c=3, and 3==n_a (3) -> yes.\n\n        Example \"aabc\": \n            Condition 1: yes (a:2, b:1, c:2)\n            Condition 2: order: a's, then b, then c's -> yes (the string is \"aabc\", so two a's, then one b, then two c's? Actually, the string is \"aabc\": \n                First character: 'a'\n                Second: 'a'\n                Third: 'b'\n                Fourth: 'c'\n                Fifth: 'c'\n                But wait, the example input is \"aabc\", which is length 4. \n                Correction: the example input is \"aabc\", so:\n                    a:2, b:1, c:2 -> but wait, the string \"aabc\" has two a's, one b, and two c's? \n                Actually, \"aabc\" is: ['a','a','b','c']? No, wait: the example says: \n                    Input: ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n                The third example is \"aabc\", which is a string of length 4: \n                    a, a, b, c? But wait, the example output is \"YES\". \n\n                Let me recount: \n                    The string \"aabc\": \n                    a: 2, b: 1, c: 1? \n                Actually, the example says: \"the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'\", so the number of c's is 1 and the number of b's is 1. \n\n                But wait, the example says: \"Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\" \n\n                So the example \"aabc\" has 2 a's, 1 b, and 1 c. \n\n                Then condition 3: 1==2 (no) or 1==1 (yes) -> valid.\n\n                However, the example says: \"aabc\" -> YES.\n\n                But wait, the example input is written as \"aabc\", which is four characters. But the counts: \n                    'a': 2, 'b': 1, 'c': 1.\n\n                Now, the order: \n                    The string is \"aabc\": \n                    First two characters: 'a','a' -> valid for a's.\n                    Then one 'b' -> valid for b's.\n                    Then one 'c' -> valid for c's.\n\n                So the order is correct.\n\n        Therefore, the example \"aabc\" is valid.\n\n        But wait, the example input provided in the problem is:\n\n          Input: ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n          Output: ['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n        So our conditions must yield:\n\n          \"aaabccc\": YES\n          \"bbacc\": NO\n          \"aabc\": YES\n\n        Now, let's check \"bbacc\":\n\n          Condition 1: at least one 'a' and one 'b' -> yes (there is one 'a' and two 'b's)\n          Condition 2: order: \n              The string: 'b','b','a','c','c'\n              We have two b's, then an 'a' (which breaks the order because after b's we should not have a's). -> invalid order.\n\n          Condition 3: doesn't matter because condition 2 fails.\n\n        So we output \"NO\" for \"bbacc\", which matches.\n\n        But wait, what if the string has no 'c'? Then condition 3 fails (unless the number of c's is 0 and the number of a's or b's is 0, which they are not because condition 1 requires at least one 'a' and one 'b').\n\n        Example: \"ab\" -> \n            Condition 1: yes (a:1, b:1, c:0)\n            Condition 2: order is correct: first a's (one 'a'), then b's (one 'b'), then no c's -> valid order.\n            Condition 3: 0==1 or 0==1 -> false -> invalid.\n\n        So \"ab\" is invalid.\n\n        However, what if the string is \"abb\"? \n            Condition 1: yes (a:1, b:2, c:0)\n            Condition 2: order: a's, then b's -> valid.\n            Condition 3: 0==1 or 0==2 -> false -> invalid.\n\n        What if the string is \"aabbcc\"? \n            Condition 1: yes (a:2, b:2, c:2)\n            Condition 2: valid order.\n            Condition 3: 2==2 or 2==2 -> true -> valid.\n\n        But wait, the condition for the c's: the number of c's (2) must be equal to the number of a's (2) OR the number of b's (2). It is.\n\n        However, note: the condition is that the number of c's appended (which is 2) must be equal to the number of a's (which is 2) OR the number of b's (which is 2). So valid.\n\n        But note: the entire string has 2 a's, 2 b's, 2 c's. \n\n        But wait, the string from B (without the c's) is \"aabb\", which has 2 a's and 2 b's. Then C appends 2 c's. Condition: 2==2 (for a's) or 2==2 (for b's) -> holds.\n\n        Another example: \"aabbc\" (with one c) -> \n            Condition 1: yes (a:2, b:2, c:1)\n            Condition 2: valid order.\n            Condition 3: 1==2 (a) or 1==2 (b) -> no.\n\n        So invalid.\n\n        Another example: \"aabbcc\" is valid.\n\n        But wait, what if the string is \"aaaccc\" (no b's)? \n            Condition 1: requires at least one 'a' and one 'b'. This string has no 'b' -> fails condition 1.\n\n        So we must check condition 1: the entire string must have at least one 'a' and at least one 'b'. \n\n        However, note: the problem says the string from B (after A and B) has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends some c's. So the entire string must have at least one 'a' and at least one 'b'. \n\n        But what if the entire string has no 'b'? Then it fails condition 1.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n        Step 1: Check that the string contains at least one 'a' and at least one 'b'. If not, return \"NO\".\n\n        Step 2: Check the order: \n            Let i = 0\n            Traverse the string until we meet a character different from the previous one.\n\n            We can do:\n                state = 'a'\n                Then we expect to see a's until we switch to 'b', then b's until we switch to 'c', then only c's.\n\n            Steps for order check:\n\n            Let last = None\n            seen_switch = []   # we can record the last character we are in\n\n            Actually, simpler:\n\n            Let n = len(s)\n            i = 0\n            # Read all a's\n            while i < n and s[i]=='a':\n                i += 1\n            # Then read all b's\n            while i < n and s[i]=='b':\n                i += 1\n            # Then read all c's\n            while i < n and s[i]=='c':\n                i += 1\n\n            If we have traversed the entire string (i == n) then the order is correct.\n\n            But note: we must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. \n\n            However, what if the string is \"ac\"? \n                Then after reading a's, we break and then try to read b's: but we don't have any b's, so the second while loop does nothing, then we try to read c's: we read one c. Then i becomes 1, then 2? \n\n            Actually, the above while loops will break the string into three parts. But the problem requires that after the a's (if any) we must have b's (if any) and then c's (if any). \n\n            However, the problem states that the string is built by appending, so the a's, then b's, then c's. \n\n            Therefore, the entire string must be partitioned into three contiguous segments: a's (possibly empty? but condition 1 requires at least one a and one b, so a's part must be non-empty and b's part must be non-empty). \n\n            But wait, condition 1 requires at least one 'a' and one 'b' in the entire string. \n\n            So we must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. \n\n            However, what if the string starts with b? Then condition 1 is satisfied (we have at least one 'b') but the order is broken.\n\n            So the order check: we must have the a's (if present) then b's (if present) then c's (if present). And we must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. \n\n            But note: the problem says A gives a string of a's (at least one) and then B appends b's (at least one). So the a's and b's must appear in that order and the a's part must be non-empty and the b's part must be non-empty.\n\n            Therefore, we can check:\n\n            Let a_part = take while the char is 'a'\n            Then b_part = take while the char is 'b'\n            Then c_part = take while the char is 'c'\n\n            The entire string must be exactly a_part + b_part + c_part.\n\n            And the a_part must be non-empty and the b_part must be non-empty.\n\n            But note: what if the string has no c's? Then the c_part is empty, which is allowed.\n\n            So the order check: \n                We must have:\n                    The string starts with zero or more 'a's (at least one because condition 1 requires at least one 'a'), then zero or more 'b's (at least one because condition 1 requires at least one 'b'), then zero or more 'c's.\n\n            However, condition 1 requires at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So the a_part must be non-empty and the b_part must be non-empty.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n            if the string does not have at least one 'a' and one 'b', then condition 1 fails.\n\n            Then, we check the order by:\n\n            i = 0\n            # Read a's\n            while i < n and s[i]=='a':\n                i += 1\n            # Now, we must have read at least one 'a' (from condition 1) and then we start reading b's.\n            if i == n: # then we read all a's and no b's or c's -> but condition 1 requires at least one 'b' -> fails, but we already checked condition 1 separately?\n            Actually, we can combine: we know the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So we can check:\n\n            Condition 1: \n                n_a = s.count('a')\n                n_b = s.count('b')\n                n_c = s.count('c')\n\n                if n_a == 0 or n_b == 0:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n            Then, for the order:\n\n            i = 0\n            # Read a's\n            while i < n and s[i]=='a':\n                i += 1\n            # Then read b's\n            while i < n and s[i]=='b':\n                i += 1\n            # Then read c's\n            while i < n and s[i]=='c':\n                i += 1\n\n            if i != n:\n                # There are other characters\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n\n            But note: condition 1 ensures at least one 'a' and one 'b', so the a_part and b_part must be non-empty? Not necessarily: the condition 1 is about the entire string having at least one 'a' and one 'b'. However, the order check must also ensure that the a's are first and then the b's. \n\n            But wait, what if the string is \"ba\"? \n                Condition 1: has one 'b' and one 'a'? Actually, no: condition 1 requires at least one 'a' and one 'b' — the entire string has one 'b' and one 'a', so condition 1 passes.\n                Then order check:\n                    First while: reads nothing (because first char is 'b', not 'a') -> i=0\n                    Then second while: reads the 'b' -> i=1\n                    Then third while: reads the 'a' (if present) -> but the next char is 'a'? Actually, the string is \"ba\": \n                        After reading the 'b', we are at index1, and the next char is 'a'. Then the third while (for 'c') doesn't read it.\n\n                Then i=1, which is less than n (which is 2). Then we check i != n -> true, so we output \"NO\".\n\n            This is correct.\n\n            However, note: the problem says the string",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by the specific process described. The process involves three steps: starting with a string of 'a's, appending some 'b's, and then appending some 'c's such that the number of 'c's equals either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the original string (before appending 'c's). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Presence of 'a' and 'b'**: The string must contain at least one 'a' and one 'b' as per the problem statement.\n2. **Validate String Order**: The string must follow the sequence where all 'a's come first, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's. Any deviation from this order makes the string invalid.\n3. **Check 'c' Count Condition**: The number of 'c's in the string must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    \n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    i = 0\n    # Read all consecutive 'a's\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'a':\n        i += 1\n    # Read all consecutive 'b's\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'b':\n        i += 1\n    # Read all consecutive 'c's\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'c':\n        i += 1\n        \n    if i != n:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Checks**: The code first checks if the string contains at least one 'a' and one 'b'. If not, it immediately outputs \"NO\".\n2. **Order Validation**: The code then verifies that the string adheres to the required order by reading all 'a's followed by 'b's followed by 'c's. If any character other than these in sequence is found, it outputs \"NO\".\n3. **Condition Check for 'c's**: Finally, the code checks if the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's. If so, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently combines the necessary checks to determine if the input string can be constructed according to the specified process.",
