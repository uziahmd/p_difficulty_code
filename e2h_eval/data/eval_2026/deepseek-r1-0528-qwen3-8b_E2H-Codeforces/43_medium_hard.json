He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$).

Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed that the string only contains 'a','b','c'\n Conditions:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and note that C appends some number of 'c' (which is either the count of 'a' OR the count of 'b' OR both, but note: the process requires that the original string from A and B has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends c's equal to the current count of 'a' or the current count of 'b' (which includes the original a's and the b's appended by B).\n\n However, note the process:\n   - A gives a string of some number of 'a's (at least one).\n   - B appends some number of 'b's (at least one) -> so the string has a part of only 'a's then only 'b's.\n   - Then C appends some number of 'c's which is equal to the total count of 'a' (from A) OR the total count of 'b' (from B) in the string at that time (which is the entire string after B's appending). But note: the entire string after B has all the 'a's and all the 'b's.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\". The string here is the one after B's appending (so including the original a's and the b's). \n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: \"aaabccc\" -> YES because the number of 'c' (which is 3) equals the number of 'a' (which is 3). \n\n Also, the example \"aabc\": \n   Count of 'a': 2, 'b':1, 'c':1 -> condition: the number of 'c' must be either 2 or 1. Here it is 1, so it matches the count of 'b'. So YES.\n\n But what about the order? The problem states that A gives a string of 'a's, then B appends 'b's, then C appends 'c's. Therefore, the string must be non-decreasing in the sense: first all 'a's, then all 'b's, then all 'c's.\n\n However, note the example \"bbacc\": \n   This is NO. Why?\n     The example input: \"bbacc\"\n     Let's break down: \n        It starts with two 'b's, but according to the process, we should have at least one 'a' at the beginning. But wait, the process says A gives a string of 'a's, then B appends 'b's. So the string must start with at least one 'a'. In \"bbacc\", the first character is 'b', so it violates the condition.\n\n But wait: what if the string has no 'a'? Then it would be invalid because A must have given at least one 'a'. Similarly, there must be at least one 'b' (from B) and then C appends some 'c's.\n\n Steps to check:\n\n 1. Check that the string is divided into three segments: [a's] then [b's] then [c's]. \n    - That means we cannot have any 'a' after a 'b', or any 'b' after a 'c', or any 'c' after an 'a' or 'b'? Actually, we can only have contiguous blocks.\n\n    So the string should be in the form: \n        S = (one or more 'a') + (one or more 'b') + (zero or more 'c')   [But note: the problem says that C appends some number of 'c', so at least one 'c'? Actually, the problem does not say that C appends at least one, but note: the condition for the number of 'c' is set to the count of 'a' or 'b'. Since the counts of 'a' and 'b' are at least 1, the number of 'c' must be at least 1. However, wait: the condition says \"some number\", but the problem does not explicitly say \"at least one\". But note: the problem says \"appends some number\", and in many contexts \"some\" implies at least one. However, let's read the problem statement: \"he appends some number of letters 'c'\", and the example counts are positive. Also, note that the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from A and B). But the problem does not require that C appends at least one 'c' if the condition is met by zero? Actually, the condition says the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. If we have zero 'c', then the condition would be: 0 == (number of 'a') or 0 == (number of 'b'). But the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b', so 0 cannot equal the count of 'a' (which is at least 1) nor the count of 'b' (which is at least 1). Therefore, the condition requires at least one 'c'. So the last segment must be non-empty.\n\n    Therefore, the string must have:\n        - At least one 'a' (so the first character must be 'a')\n        - Then at least one 'b' (so after the 'a's, we must have at least one 'b')\n        - Then the rest (if any) must be 'c'\n\n    But wait: what if the string is \"aaa\"? Then we don't have any 'b' and 'c'. According to the problem, B appends some number of 'b' (at least one) and then C appends some number of 'c'. So the entire string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. However, note that the problem says \"at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string\" (after B) and then C appends. But after C, the condition on the string is that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' or 'b'. \n\n    Actually, the problem says: \n        \"B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\"\n\n    So the string we have is the final string. And the condition is that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b' (in the entire string after B's appending, which is the string without the 'c's? No, wait: the problem says \"in the string\", meaning the entire string that B gives to C (which includes the 'a's and 'b's) or the entire string after C? \n\n    Let me re-read: \n        \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\"\n\n    Here, the string is the one that B gives to C, i.e., the string without the appended 'c's. \n\n    But wait, the problem says: \n        \"B appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string.\" (from A's string)\n        Then, \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\" (the string at that time is the one from A and B)\n\n    And then: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\"\n\n    The word \"in the string\" refers to the string that exists before C appends the 'c's, i.e., the string that B gives to C. \n\n    However, note: the problem says \"B now gives this string to C\", meaning the string that B gives is the one with the 'a's and 'b's. So the count of 'a' and 'b' is fixed (from the original A and B). \n\n    But wait, the entire string after C's appending will have the same number of 'a' and 'b' as the string that B gave, because C only appends 'c's.\n\n    So the condition is: the number of 'c' (which is the count of 'c' in the entire string) must be equal to the count of 'a' (from the original A) OR the count of 'b' (from B) in the entire string that B gave (which is the entire string without the 'c's). \n\n    However, note: the entire string that B gave is the prefix of the final string (without the trailing 'c's). \n\n    But wait, the entire string we have is the final string. How do we know the count of 'a' and 'b' that B gave? \n\n    Actually, the entire string that B gave is the entire string except the appended 'c's. But note: the process requires that the string is built by first A's 'a's, then B's 'b's, then C's 'c's. So the 'a's and 'b's are contiguous at the beginning. \n\n    So the string must be split into three parts: \n        Part1: one or more 'a's (until the first non-'a')\n        Part2: one or more 'b's (until the first non-'b')\n        Part3: the rest, which must be 'c's.\n\n    And the condition on the length of part3 (the number of 'c's) is: \n        len(part3) must be equal to the count of 'a' (which is the length of part1) OR the count of 'b' (which is the length of part2).\n\n    However, note: the problem does not specify that the entire string must be split into these three contiguous parts. What if there are other letters? The problem states the string consists of 'a','b','c'. And the process is: A gives a string of 'a's, then B appends 'b's, then C appends 'c's. So the string must be in the form: \n        [a...a][b...b][c...c]\n\n    Therefore, the steps:\n\n    Step 1: Check that the string is in non-decreasing order (i.e., once we leave 'a', we only see 'b'; once we leave 'b', we only see 'c').\n\n    Step 2: Count the number of 'a', 'b', and 'c' (but note: the 'c' count is the entire trailing part, and the 'a' and 'b' counts are from the respective contiguous blocks).\n\n    However, note: the condition is that the number of 'c' (which is the entire trailing 'c' block) must equal the number of 'a' (the entire leading 'a' block) OR the number of 'b' (the entire middle 'b' block). \n\n    But wait: the problem says \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\". The string here is the one that B gave (which is the entire string without the 'c's). \n\n    However, note: the entire string without the 'c's is just the first two blocks. The count of 'a' in the entire string (without the 'c's) is the same as the count of 'a' in the entire string (because the 'c' block doesn't contain 'a')? Yes. Similarly for 'b'.\n\n    So the condition is: \n        Let n_a = count of 'a' in the entire string (which is the same as the count in the first block)\n        Let n_b = count of 'b' in the entire string (same as the second block)\n        Let n_c = count of 'c' in the entire string\n\n        Then, n_c must be equal to n_a OR n_c must be equal to n_b.\n\n    But wait: is that correct? \n\n    Example: \"aaabccc\"\n        n_a = 3, n_b = 1, n_c = 3 -> condition: 3==3 (n_c==n_a) -> YES.\n\n    Example: \"aabc\"\n        n_a = 2, n_b = 1, n_c = 1 -> condition: 1==1 (n_c==n_b) -> YES.\n\n    Example: \"abbccc\"\n        n_a = 1, n_b = 2, n_c = 3 -> condition: 3==1? no; 3==2? no -> NO.\n\n    However, wait: the example \"aabc\" is given as YES, and our condition holds.\n\n    But what about the order? The condition also requires that the string is in the form of [a...][b...][c...]?\n\n    Example: \"abac\" -> This is not allowed because after the first 'a' and 'b', we get an 'a' again. So we must check the order.\n\n    Steps:\n\n    1. Check the order: \n        - The string must start with at least one 'a'.\n        - Then, when we see a 'b', we cannot see an 'a' again.\n        - Then, when we see a 'c', we cannot see an 'a' or 'b' again.\n\n    Alternatively, we can traverse and make sure that the characters never decrease in the sense of the alphabet: \n        'a' < 'b' < 'c'\n\n    So we can do:\n\n        Let i = 0\n        While i < n and s[i]=='a': i++\n        Then while i < n and s[i]=='b': i++\n        Then while i < n and s[i]=='c': i++\n\n        If we have traversed the whole string and the above conditions hold (we saw at least one 'a', then at least one 'b', then the rest 'c') then the order is correct.\n\n    However, note: it is possible that there are no 'b's? But the problem states that B appends some number of 'b's (at least one). Similarly, the entire string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from A and B). \n\n    So the process requires that the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Therefore, the first block must have at least one 'a', the second block must have at least one 'b', and the third block (if exists) must be at least one? Not necessarily: the condition for the third block (the 'c's) is set by the counts of 'a' and 'b'. But note: the condition requires that the number of 'c' is either the count of 'a' or the count of 'b'. Since the counts of 'a' and 'b' are at least 1, the number of 'c' must be at least 1. So the third block must be non-empty.\n\n    However, wait: what if the condition is met by the count of 'a' being 0? But we know there's at least one 'a'. So the condition is always defined.\n\n    But note: the problem says \"at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string\" (after B). So the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. \n\n    Therefore, the string must have:\n        - At least one 'a'\n        - At least one 'b'\n        - At least one 'c' (because the appended 'c' count is the same as the count of 'a' or 'b', which are at least 1, so the appended 'c' must be at least 1)\n\n    Now, what if the string does not have the three contiguous blocks? For example, \"acb\": \n        This fails the order check because after 'a' we see 'c' and then 'b' (which is out of order).\n\n    Algorithm:\n\n    Step 1: Check that the string is composed of three contiguous blocks: first all 'a', then all 'b', then all 'c'. \n\n    Step 2: Count the number of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n\n    Step 3: Check that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\n    However, note: the counts of 'a' and 'b' we use in the condition are the counts from the entire string (which are the same as the counts in the respective blocks). \n\n    But wait: the condition says \"in the string\" (meaning the string that B gave, which is the entire string without the 'c's). The counts of 'a' and 'b' in that string are the same as in the final string (because the 'c' block doesn't contribute). \n\n    So we can simply count the entire string.\n\n    However, we must also check that the string is in the correct order (three contiguous blocks). \n\n    There is one more possibility: what if the string has no 'b'? Then the condition requires at least one 'b' (from B). Similarly, no 'a'? Then invalid. No 'c'? Then the condition requires at least one 'c' (since the count of 'a' and 'b' are at least 1, and the appended 'c' must be at least one). \n\n    Therefore, the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. \n\n    But note: the problem does not say that the entire string must have at least one 'c'? Actually, the condition requires that the number of 'c' is either the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. Since the number of 'a' is at least 1 and the number of 'b' is at least 1, the number of 'c' must be at least 1.\n\n    However, there is an exception: what if the condition is met by both? Then we have two possibilities, but the condition is satisfied.\n\n    Example: \"aabbcc\": \n        n_a=2, n_b=2, n_c=2 -> condition: 2==2 (for 'a') or 2==2 (for 'b') -> YES.\n\n    But wait: the order must be three contiguous blocks. In \"aabbcc\", the order is correct.\n\n    However, consider \"aabbc\": \n        n_a=2, n_b=2, n_c=1 -> condition: 1==2? no; 1==2? no -> NO.\n\n    But wait, what if the condition is that the number of 'c' is the same as the number of 'a' or the number of 'b' in the string that B gave? \n\n    The string that B gave is \"aabb\" (without the 'c'). Then the condition for C is that the number of 'c' (which is 1) must be equal to the number of 'a' (2) OR the number of 'b' (2). It is not. So NO.\n\n    However, what if the condition is interpreted differently? The problem says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\" \n\n    The string here is the string that B gives, which is \"aabb\". The number of 'a' in that string is 2, the number of 'b' is 2. So the condition is that the appended 'c' (which is 1) must be 2 or 2. It isn't.\n\n    But note: the example \"aabc\" is \"aabc\", meaning the string that B gives is \"aab\", and then C appends one 'c'. Then the condition: the number of 'c' (1) must be equal to the number of 'a' (2) OR the number of 'b' (1). It is equal to the number of 'b' (1). So YES.\n\n    Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n    Let s = input string.\n\n    Step 1: Check that the string is in non-decreasing order (only 'a's, then only 'b's, then only 'c's). \n\n        We can do:\n\n        i = 0\n        # Read all 'a's\n        while i < len(s) and s[i]=='a':\n            i += 1\n        # Then read all 'b's\n        while i < len(s) and s[i]=='b':\n            i += 1\n        # Then read all 'c's\n        while i < len(s) and s[i]=='c':\n            i += 1\n\n        If i != len(s): then the string has an invalid character or order, so return \"NO\".\n\n        But note: we must ensure that we have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'? Actually, the process requires at least one 'a' and one 'b' (so the first two blocks must be present). And the condition requires at least one 'c'. \n\n        However, the above while loops might not catch if we have no 'a' or no 'b'? \n\n        We can break down the string into three parts:\n\n        Let part1 = longest prefix of 'a'\n        Let part2 = next longest prefix of 'b' (if part1 ends, then part2 starts)\n        Let part3 = the rest (must be 'c')\n\n        Then, conditions for validity of the structure:\n\n        - part1 must be non-empty (at least one 'a')\n        - part2 must be non-empty (at least one 'b')\n        - part3 must be non-empty (at least one 'c')? Actually, the condition requires the number of 'c' to be the same as the count of 'a' or 'b'. Since the counts of 'a' and 'b' are at least 1, the 'c' count must be at least 1. But wait, the condition does not require the entire string to have three blocks? Actually, the process requires that the string is built by appending. The problem does not say that the string must have three contiguous blocks, but the process description implies that.\n\n        However, the problem says: \n            - A gives a string of 'a's (so the string starts with 'a's)\n            - B appends 'b's (so after the 'a's, there are 'b's)\n            - C appends 'c's (so after the 'b's, there are 'c's)\n\n        Therefore, the string must have three contiguous blocks.\n\n        But note: what if there are no 'b'? Then the second while loop would not run and we would go to the third. But the problem requires that B appends at least one 'b'. So we must have at least one 'b'. Similarly, at least one 'a' and at least one 'c'.\n\n        Therefore, we must check that the entire string is split into three non-empty contiguous blocks: [a+][b+][c+].\n\n        Step 2: Count the total number of 'a', 'b', and 'c' (which is the length of part1, part2, and part3 respectively).\n\n        Step 3: Check that the length of part3 (the count of 'c') is either the length of part1 (count of 'a') or the length of part2 (count of 'b').\n\n        However, note: the condition is on the entire string that B gives (which is part1+part2) for the counts of 'a' and 'b'. But the entire string that B gives is part1+part2, so the count of 'a' is len(part1) and the count of 'b' is len(part2). Then the condition is: \n            len(part3) == len(part1) OR len(part3) == len(part2)\n\n        But wait: the problem says \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\". The string that B gives has the same number of 'a' and 'b' as the entire string? \n\n        The entire string is part1+part2+part3. The string that B gives is part1+part2. Therefore, the count of 'a' in the string that B gives is len(part1), and the count of 'b' is len(part2). \n\n        Then the condition is: the number of 'c' (which is the entire part3, so len(part3)) must be equal to len(part1) OR len(part2).\n\n        So we can do:\n\n        Let a_count = len(part1)\n        Let b_count = len(part2)\n        Let c_count = len(part3)\n\n        Then, if (c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count) and the entire string is split into three non-empty contiguous blocks (so a_count>=1, b_count>=1, c_count>=1) then \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\n    However, what if the string has no 'c'? Then part3 is empty, so c_count=0. Then the condition fails (because the condition requires that the number of 'c' is either a_count or b_count, and a_count and b_count are at least 1). So that is caught.\n\n    But note: the problem does not explicitly state that the entire string must be split into three non-empty contiguous blocks, but the process implies that. \n\n    Example: \"aaabccc\": \n        part1: \"aaa\" -> a_count=3\n        part2: \"b\" -> b_count=1\n        part3: \"ccc\" -> c_count=3\n        Condition: 3==3 (True) -> YES.\n\n    Example: \"aabc\":\n        part1: \"aa\" -> a_count=2\n        part2: \"b\" -> b_count=1\n        part3: \"c\" -> c_count=1\n        Condition: 1==2? False, 1==1? True -> YES.\n\n    Example: \"abbccc\":\n        part1: \"a\" -> a_count=1\n        part2: \"bb\" -> b_count=2\n        part3: \"ccc\" -> c_count=3\n        Condition: 3==1? False, 3==2? False -> NO.\n\n    Example: \"aaa\": \n        This string has no 'b' and no 'c'. \n        Our while loops: \n            part1: \"aaa\", then part2: nothing (so we break and then part3: nothing). \n        Then we have part1 non-empty, but part2 and part3 empty -> invalid.\n\n    Example: \"bbbb\": \n        part1: nothing (so we break immediately) -> invalid.\n\n    Example: \"cccc\": \n        part1: nothing, part2: nothing, part3: \"cccc\" -> invalid.\n\n    Example: \"aabbcc\": \n        part1: \"aa\", part2: \"bb\", part3: \"cc\"\n        a_count=2, b_count=2, c_count=2 -> condition: 2==2 (True) -> YES.\n\n    Example: \"aab\": \n        part1: \"aa\", part2: \"b\", part3: \"\" -> invalid because part3 is empty.\n\n    But wait, the problem says that C appends some number of 'c's. So the string must include the 'c's. Therefore, we require part3 to be non-empty.\n\n    However, note: the condition for the number of 'c' is set to the number of 'a' or 'b'. If the condition is set to 0 (if the string that B gives has 0 'a' or 0 'b'), then it would be invalid because the condition requires the appended 'c' to be 0, but the problem says \"some number\" (which usually means at least one). But wait, the problem does not specify that the appended number is positive. However, the problem states: \"B appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string\" and similarly for C. \n\n    In common usage, \"some\" implies at least one. However, let's look at the problem statement: \n        \"B appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string.\" \n        \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\"\n\n    So we must assume that the appended numbers are at least one. Therefore, the entire string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n    Therefore, we can add the condition that part1, part2, part3 are all non-empty.\n\n    However, note: the condition on the counts: if the string is split into three contiguous blocks (with the order) but one of the blocks is empty, then we don't meet the requirement. \n\n    But the problem requires at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from A and B) and then C appends some 'c' (so at least one 'c'). Therefore, we require:\n\n        part1 non-empty, part2 non-empty, part3 non-empty.\n\n    So the algorithm:\n\n        Step 1: Traverse the string to split into three contiguous blocks (if the order is broken, return \"NO\").\n        Step 2: Check that each block is non-empty (so we have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c').\n        Step 3: Check that the length of the third block (c_count) is equal to the length of the first block (a_count) OR the length of the second block (b_count).\n\n    However, note: the problem does not require that the entire string is split into three contiguous blocks? Actually, the process implies that. \n\n    But what if the string is \"aaaccc\"? \n        This is not valid because the condition requires that B appends at least one 'b'. So we must have at least one 'b'. \n\n    Therefore, we must check that the second block is non-empty.\n\n    So the code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n        # If the string is empty, then no, because we need at least one 'a' and one 'b' and one 'c'\n        if len(s) < 3:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        # Step 1: Split the string into three contiguous blocks: 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's.\n        # We'll traverse until we break the order.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can check the order by ensuring that the string is sorted (non-decreasing) and that the characters are only 'a','b','c'\n\n        # Another method: \n        #   Let i = 0\n        #   while i < len(s) and s[i]=='a': i++\n        #   j = i\n        #   while j < len(s) and s[j]=='b': j++\n        #   k = j\n        #   while k < len(s) and s[k]=='c': k++\n\n        #   Then if k != len(s): invalid order.\n\n        # But we can also check that we have at least one 'a', one 'b', one 'c' by the lengths of the blocks.\n\n        # However, we can do:\n\n        #   Check that the string is in order: \n        #       The first character is 'a', the last is 'c'? Not necessarily, but the entire string must be non-decreasing.\n\n        #   Alternatively, we can check: \n        #       for i in range(len(s)-1):\n        #           if s[i] > s[i+1]:\n        #               return \"NO\"\n\n        #   But wait: the string is built from 'a','b','c', so if we have 'a','b','c', then the condition is that the string is non-decreasing.\n\n        # However, note: the problem says the string consists of 'a','b','c'. So we can check for non-decreasing order.\n\n        # But note: the string \"aabc\" is non-decreasing? \n        #   'a' <= 'a' <= 'b' <= 'c' -> yes.\n\n        # But wait, what if the string is \"aba\"? \n        #   'a' <= 'b' -> ok, but then 'b' <= 'a' -> not ok. \n\n        # So we can check:\n\n        #   for i in range(1, len(s)):\n        #       if s[i] < s[i-1]:   # because we want non-decreasing, so each character should be >= the previous.\n        #           print(\"NO\")\n        #           exit(0)\n\n        # However, note: the problem allows only the letters 'a','b','c', so the non-decreasing condition is sufficient.\n\n        # But wait: the problem does not require that the string is composed of only these three, but we are given that.\n\n        # However, the above non-decreasing check will fail for any inversion. \n\n        # But note: the problem says the string is built by the process, so the order must be non-decreasing.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        #   Let a_end = s.find('b')   # first index of 'b'\n        #   If a_end == -1: then no 'b' -> invalid.\n\n        #   Let b_end = s.find('c', a_end)   # first index of 'c' after the 'b's\n        #   If b_end == -1: then no 'c' -> invalid.\n\n        #   Then check that from the start to a_end-1 is all 'a', from a_end to b_end-1 is all 'b', and from b_end to the end is all 'c'.\n\n        # But the above may be overcomplicating.\n\n        # Let me use the splitting method:\n\n        #   part1 = take all consecutive 'a' from the start\n        #   part2 = take all consecutive 'b' starting from the next after part1\n        #   part3 = the rest, which must be consecutive 'c'\n\n        # Steps:\n\n        #   i = 0\n        #   while i < len(s) and s[i]=='a':\n        #       i += 1\n        #   j = i\n        #   while j < len(s) and s[j]=='b':\n        #       j += 1\n        #   k = j\n        #   while k < len(s) and s[k]=='c':\n        #       k += 1\n\n        #   if k != len(s):\n        #       print(\"NO\")\n        #       exit(0)\n\n        #   Then, we have three parts: s[0:i], s[i:j], s[j:k]\n\n        #   Then, check that each part is non-empty: i>0, j>i, k>j.\n\n        #   Then, check that the length of the third part (k-j) is either i (the length of the first part) or (j-i) (the length of the second part).\n\n        # But note: the third part is s[j:k], so its length is k-j.\n\n        # However, we can also do:\n\n        #   a_count = i\n        #   b_count = j - i\n        #   c_count = k - j\n\n        #   Then, if (c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count) and a_count>=1 and b_count>=1 and c_count>=1:\n        #       print(\"YES\")\n        #   else:\n        #       print(\"NO\")\n\n        # But wait: what if the string is \"aaaabbbbcccc\", then we split correctly.\n\n        # Example: \"aaaabbbbcccc\": \n        #   a_count=4, b_count=4, c_count=4 -> YES.\n\n        # Example: \"aaaabbbc\": \n        #   a_count=4, b_count=3, c_count=1 -> 1==4? no, 1==3? no -> NO.\n\n        # Example: \"aaaabbb\": \n        #   This string has no 'c'.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by the specific process described. The process involves three steps: A provides a string of 'a's, B appends some 'b's, and C appends a number of 'c's equal to either the count of 'a's or 'b's in the string before appending the 'c's. The final string must be in non-decreasing order (all 'a's followed by all 'b's followed by all 'c's) and must contain at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check String Structure**: The string must start with one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, and end with one or more 'c's. Any deviation from this order means the string is invalid.\n2. **Count Characters**: After verifying the order, count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in the string.\n3. **Validate Condition**: The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. Additionally, ensure that there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c' in the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    \n    if n < 3:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    i = 0\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'a':\n        i += 1\n        \n    j = i\n    while j < n and s[j] == 'b':\n        j += 1\n        \n    k = j\n    while k < n and s[k] == 'c':\n        k += 1\n        \n    if k != n:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    a_count = i\n    b_count = j - i\n    c_count = k - j\n    \n    if a_count == 0 or b_count == 0 or c_count == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace.\n2. **Early Exit for Short Strings**: If the string length is less than 3, it's impossible to have all three required characters, so the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n3. **Traverse for 'a's**: The code first counts all consecutive 'a's at the beginning of the string.\n4. **Traverse for 'b's**: Next, it counts all consecutive 'b's following the 'a's.\n5. **Traverse for 'c's**: Then, it checks for all consecutive 'c's at the end of the string.\n6. **Order Validation**: If the entire string isn't traversed (i.e., an invalid character or wrong order is found), the answer is \"NO\".\n7. **Character Counts**: The counts of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's are derived from the traversal.\n8. **Minimum Character Check**: Ensures there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n9. **Condition Check**: The number of 'c's must match either the number of 'a's or 'b's for the string to be valid, printing \"YES\" or \"NO\" accordingly.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the structural and numerical conditions required by the problem, ensuring correctness while maintaining clarity and simplicity.",
